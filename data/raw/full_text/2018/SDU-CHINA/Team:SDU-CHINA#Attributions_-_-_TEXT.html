Design and construction of part PcpcG2-crRNA: Yize Hao,Liyuan Xi,  Zhaoqin Zhang and Junyang Chen
Design and construction of part PcpcG2-PHB: Liyuan Xi, Zijian Pan, and Yize Hao.
Design and construction of part phbcab: Our PI.
Characterization：
The target site of crRNA was designed by Yizhao Chang and data of fluorescence intensity was provided by Yizhao Chang.
The characterization of crRNA was designed by Yizhao Chang and conducted by Jiao Jin and Yize Hao. Abs600 was measured by Jiao Jin and cells were inoculated by Yize Hao.
The characterization of CcaS/CcaR was conducted by Yize Hao, Liyuan Xi, Junyang Chen, Jiao Jin, Zijian Pan according to the protocol from the reference. Fluorescence intensity was measured by Liyuan Xi and Junyang Chen, measurement of Abs600 was done by Jiao Jin and Zijian Pan.
The characterization of opto-T7RNAP was conducted by Zilong Geng, Jiao Jin, Zijian Pan and Yumin Meng according to the protocol from the reference. SDS-PAGE was done by Zilong Geng
Fermentation:
The Fermentation was designed and conducted by Yize Hao, Zijian Pan, Jiao Jin, and Liyuan Xi
Hardware:
The light-device 1.0 was designed and made by Weiguang Wang.
Modeling:
The modeling work was performed by Jizhong Zhang.
Wiki&art:
Wiki and art are designed and constructed by Yize Hao and Jizhong Zhang. The text was edited by the rest of the Team and polished by Zedao Liu.
Standardization
Standardization was conducted by Zhaoqin Zhang, Jiao Jin, Yumin Meng, Zijian Pan Liyuan Xi.
Interlab
Interlab was conducted by Junyang Chen.
Human Practices
Human practice was conducted by Jiao Jin, Yize Hao, Zhaoqin Zhang, Yumin Meng and Zilong Geng.
Funding
Initial founds of the project was raised by Zilong Geng from SDU and subsequently by Qingsheng Qi (Profeesor at SDU，qiqingsheng@sdu.edu.cn) and Quanfeng Liang (Profeesor at SDU，liangquanfeng@sdu.edu.cn).
