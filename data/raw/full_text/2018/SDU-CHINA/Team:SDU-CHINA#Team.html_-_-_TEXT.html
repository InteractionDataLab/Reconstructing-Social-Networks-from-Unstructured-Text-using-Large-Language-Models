The mascot of the team! The major work for me is to cheer people up when things do not go well!
Zhaoqin Zhang
Competition Affairs/Experimentation
I’m a junior student majoring in biology. It is the first time for me as well as our team to  participate in iGEM competition, I' m so excited to meet so much interesting guys! I mainly take charge of Human Practice and do some wet lab experiments, which offers me a lot experience in social skills and research skills. I am interested in synthetic biology in eukariotic cells and I believe synthetic biology is of great use in both research and practical use.
Yize Hao
Wiki edit/Experimentation
I hope I can improve my ability of thinking as well as my technical skills through igem. I will begin my postgraduate career after one year. I hope I can go further along the road of scientific research.
Zijian Pan
Experimentation
I am very grateful for having the opportunity to play a role in our igem team. For the duration of preparing for iGEM, we struggle with countless difficulties together. For this duration, we harvest knowledge and life-long friendships, as well.

Yumin Meng
Experimentation
My name is Meng Yumin. I study biology in the School of Life Science and I am a sophoman. I undertook the job of designing and assembling the genetic circuit of the project with other teammates. In addition, I manually modified our experimental instrument to make it more suitable for our project with my hands-on ability. Looking forward to the new age of synthetic biology from iGEM.
