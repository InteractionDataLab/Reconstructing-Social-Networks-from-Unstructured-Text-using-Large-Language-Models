      I’m a junior student majoring in biology. It is the first time for me as well as our team to participate in iGEM competition, I' m so excited to meet so much interesting guys! I mainly take charge of Human Practice and do some wet lab experiments, which offers me a lot experience in social skills and research skills. I am interested in synthetic biology in eukariotic cells and I believe synthetic biology is of great use in both research and practical use.

     I am so kind of being a member of SDU-China iGEM team and feeling honoured to work with everyone in our team. As a part of our team, I am responsible for our interlab study. In the meantime, I also take part in our wetlab experiment. Particularly , iGEM project greatly helps me to form my science elaborative faculty, which contributes to my future development and career. Wish us meet with success in this Jamboree！

     Howdy, this is Zero. Since it is my first time to participate such big competition as the iGEM, I feel so honored and appreciated. The iGEM opened my eyes with a brand new world where  I never set foot. And the cross disciplines in synthetic biology truly rebuilt my point of views about traditional biology, which makes me seek for higher horizons. My teammates work really hard and solidly, which makes me grateful and teaches me a lesson about what teamwork is.

     I study biology in the School of Life Science and I am a sophoman. I undertook the job of designing and assembling the genetic circuit of the project with other teammates. In addition, I manually modified our experimental instrument to make it more suitable for our project with my hands-on ability. Looking forward to the new age of synthetic biology from iGEM.
