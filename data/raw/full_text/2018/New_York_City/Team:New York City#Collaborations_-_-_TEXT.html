Collaborations
Westminster University iGEM Team
New York City iGEM Team collaborated with Westminster University iGem team and submitted the video included             our video in their presentation! Check out our video:
SYSU-SOFTWARE iGEM Team
New York City iGEM Team collaborated with SYSU-SOFTWARE 2018 iGEM Team (Sun Yat-Sen University) by filling             out their Software questionnaire.
City of New York Kingsborough Community College iGEM Team
We collaborated with City of New York Kingsborough Community College iGEM Team to collect the necessary             data to characterize the results from their protocol with access to EtBr, where we prepared a sample of DNA             with a concentration of their choice (0.5 ng/µl) and a 1 µg/mL dilution of DNA. Then, we created a spot by             adding 1 uL of the diluted DNA to 9 uL of diluted EtBr -- for a total of 10 uL per spot (sample picture             below). We provided five samples. We also exchanged ideas about our iGEM projects. Thanks to Amy Yang for presenting CUNY Kingsborough iGEM's exciting research project :)
We also collaborated with CUNY Kingsborough Community College iGEM Team on EtBr project with same 6 samples - for one we took the picture with the overhead light turned off and for the other with the overhead light turned on. In retrospect, our DNA sample concentration was not very high to start off with and when it was diluted the concentration decreased even more.
Macquarie iGEM Team
We collaborated with Macquarie 2018 iGEM Team (Macquarie University, Sydney Australia) by filling out their             survey where they gathered information about human practices.
Tartu TUIT (Estonia) iGEM Team
We collaborated with Tartu TUIT 2018 iGEM Team (Estonia) we provided around 5 pictures from our lab with             original and fun lab-look, using interestingly colored lab gloves, lab glasses, lab coats with cool and fun             looks. The idea behind Tartu TUIT iGEM team was to create a huge photo-mosaic of stylish lab photos, like             fashion look book to express unity of iGEMers: comning the world, synthetic biology and teams in la all             around the world. It was fun! :)
Biotech Without Borders iGEM Team
New York City iGEM Team collaborated with Biotech Without Borders 2018 iGEM Team by using their lab             facility to continue our research.
