InterLab
For this yearâ€™s InterLab study, we performed bacterial transformations in E. Coli using the plasmids             provided by iGEM. These plasmids had different levels of fluorescence, which was validated using a cell             plate reader that measured absorbance as well as fluorescence. A range of fluorescence was observed in the             different plasmids, some having a level of fluorescence as low as the negative control and others having a             level of fluorescence as high as the positive control. The InterLab protocol that was provided was             straightforward and easy to follow. The diagrams that were provided illustrating the experimental designs             were very helpful and all these factors contributed to an overall positive experience.
