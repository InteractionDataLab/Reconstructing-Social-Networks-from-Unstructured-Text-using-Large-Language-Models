Our project would have been impossible without help from the following individuals and             organizations.
A huge thank you to our three research supervisors, Russell Hanson, Jason                 Fuller and Andrew                 Cheng, for providing guidance throughout the complicated and challenging laboratory             experiments. We would             also like to thank the wonderful staff of the Genetics Department of Mount Sinai Hospital for giving us an             opportunity to conduct experiments.
We are also appreciative of our project supervisors Frank Muradov and Suny Oh and their             mentorship and motivation throughout the project.
We are grateful to Amar Seoparson, an alumnus from NYU and the Bronx High             School of Science,             for helping us             with integrating our website and transferring content into the Wiki.
We are grateful to Columbia University Synthetic Biology Initiative and Jason Mohabir, a             student at Columbia University, for providing us space to present our project and for their valuable             feedback.
We appreciate the academic discounts offered by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) for G-blocks             and NEB for Assembly kit.
