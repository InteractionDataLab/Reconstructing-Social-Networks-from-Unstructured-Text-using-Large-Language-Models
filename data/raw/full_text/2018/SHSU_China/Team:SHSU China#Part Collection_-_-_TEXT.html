This part collection will serve as a powerful toolkit for future iGEM teams to create protein cargo loaded exosomes. Teams can use BBa_K2794001 to insert membrane proteins, signal peptide, or regular proteins to the exosomes. BBa_K2794002 BBa_K2794003 BBa_K2794004 can be used to actively load protein cargo into exosomes.
