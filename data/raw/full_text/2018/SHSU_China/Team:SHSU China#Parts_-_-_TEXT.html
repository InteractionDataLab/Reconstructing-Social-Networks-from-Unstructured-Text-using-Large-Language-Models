Short description of our parts.
BBa_K2794001, as a sequence coding for marker protein of exosome, can be used to insert membrane proteins, signal peptide, or regular proteins to the exosomes. BBa_K2794002 is designed to specifically activates ubiquitination. BBa_K2794003 BBa_K2794004 can be used to actively load protein cargo into exosomes, while BBa_K2794005 focus primarily on specifically load vhb into exosomes. BBa_K2794006 attaches a WW domain to vhb, enabling an alternative for bingding vhb to Ndfip.
