As although we've encountered blood and toil, we've also met kindness and joy of achievements.

class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="section-heading mb-5"><H2 class="heading">Our Stories</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text"><P class="mb-4">“I like to assemble things, whether they are LEGO blocks, electronic parts, or Biobricks. At first all I love is to do engineering with mechanical or electrical parts, but later I started to indulge in the most intricate machine on the planet earth, that is, life. Some people love biology because they want to make great discoveries. Some people want to use it to make the world a better place. Some find themselves satisfied learning how their body works. But my reason is simple: I just cannot resist operating this machine, evolved on it self for billions of years, and use them to solve out everyday problems.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Tom Luo</P><P class="mb-4">I am an explorer, so biology fits me. I am curious about everything in this world, so I ask questions and try my best to figure out the solution. In seventh grade, I first learnt biology. I immediately fell in love with this subject because the way it explains the world is so different yet so clear. It covers everything from the tiniest particles to the largest concepts, so it helped me to solve many of my problems easily. Since then, I began to dig deeper into biology. I started a personal website to share fun things about human body and healthy lifestyles; I also did some experiments with experts. Now I can proudly say that biology is my favorite subject.</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Cherry Tian</P><P class="mb-4">“It is always hard to say who I am. From different perspectives I can be very different. I am interested in reading and good at learning. Although I study only chemistry HL and physics HL in IB, I also study biology by myself. This time I work as a dry team member, and it is more about communication. I am willing to contribute for my team for all missions, and I will show my effort.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Jessica Ji</P><P class="mb-4">“I became interested in biology in middle school because I was fascinated by the plants and animals’ organs and bacteria. I want to study viruses, antibiotics, and other things in the future. I am also take Latin as my third language in my current school. I have been a car enthusiast since kindergarten. I recently became a sneaker collector as well.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Oliver Li</P><P class="mb-4">“When I was young, I loved to read books, especially about science. It was the first time that I found myself fascinated by human body when I came into middle school. It is so interesting that the human body acts in such a sophisticated way while making little wrong. So I decided to devote myself to biology. I want to know everything that is happening in human body and in the nature world. How does it operate? What made it working like this? I just can’t help searching for the answers.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Alex Han</P><P class="mb-4">“Biology has been affecting human lives and development in all aspects, as even a small child can understand its relatedness to current livings. No matter in the study of environmental protection or in the practice of pharmacotherapy, a high level of knowledge in the field of biology is always required. I study biology because I have recognized its filtration in every space of life, and I want to use my knowledge in the related area to make the world become a better one, whether reducing the pain of illness for people, saving animals or just protecting the environment in a proper way. I believe it is always worth trying and making efforts. I join this group, for I believe that together with my teammates, WE are able to create something by synthetic biology that can be useful for the society. I would certainly work hard for the project and hope our efforts will pay off.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Cindy Miao</P><P class="mb-4">“The simple fact that human has acquired the ability to inspect, to learn about the most delicate being, human himself, and the grand social and biological environment enchants me. How we have been able to leap away from natural selection through engineering and modern medicine demonstrates the extraordinary beauty of human intelligence. Its unlimited power of change is yet to be fully unlocked. I am eager and honored to be a witness and, moreover, hopefully a participant in the process.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Laura Wang</P><P class="mb-4">“Studying biology, I become to be conscious that I’m so lucky with all parts of my body functioning well. That was not the case for my grandmother, who suffered from Parkinson’s Disease, which destroys nerve cells that cannot be revitalized. Her life quality greatly decreased, losing her ability to swallow and breathe gradually. Bioengineering has the potential to cure, or at least help, people in her condition and many others. So I get myself into it. Besides, I value expertise, leadership, team work, ability to find issues, to imagine and to associate. I hope these qualities will be backing our team to a better outcome.”</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Jiuqi Shen</P><P class="mb-4">I am fascinated by Biology when I got to know the twenty senses that a plant could have. Studying plants is way more difficult than studying AI. I am curious about the biological world where the plants are evolved, and when I got deeper, it becomes more interesting. As a member of dry team, I do some research about a biotechnological company which is helpful to collect few ideas that can be used to support our project.</P><P class="mb-4">--------------Sinan Yang</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><FOOTER class="site-footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row pt-5"><DIV class="col-md-12 text-center copyright"><P class="float-md-left" color="white">
