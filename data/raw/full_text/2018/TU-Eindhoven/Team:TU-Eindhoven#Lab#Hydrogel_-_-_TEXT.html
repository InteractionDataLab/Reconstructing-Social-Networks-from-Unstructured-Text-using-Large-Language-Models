Hydrogel
As described on our design page, we based our hydrogel on a paper from 2012,                      in which glycidyl methacrylate derivatized dextran is polymerized into super                      macroporous dextran hydrogels. The subzero temperature polymerization conditions                      employed in this paper result in an interconnected supermacroporous hydrogel with                      pores ranging from 1 to 100 micrometer. This unique morphology allows for the rapid                      and non-restricted mass-transport of solutes of virtually any size and has already                      been used as a matrix for cell seeding. (1) Therefore, this paper has                      been used as a starting point for the synthesis of our hydrogel.
The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.

Functionalization of dextran
Before the dextran polymer molecules can be crosslinked into a covalent network,                              they first need to be functionalized. As dextran source we used dextran 500kDa                              polymer of pharmaceutical quality, kindly provided by Pharmacosmos. Each polymer                              chain has a weight of approximately 500kDa, and therefore consists of approximately                              three thousand glucopyranose units. Based on the methods described in the article                              by Plieva et al. (1) , we decided to functionalize the dextran polymer chains by                              methacrylation. Subsequently, the methacrylated dextran molecules can be polymerised                              into a covalent hydrogel network via radical polymerisation. (1) The methacrylation reaction using glycidyl methacrylate is illustrated in figure 1. We designed the reaction in                              such a way that for every 100 glucopyranose units, 60 glucopyranose units are                              functionalized with a methacrylate group (a degree of substitution (DS) of 60). The resulting reaction mixture of this reaction can be seen in figure 2. Exact details                              about the functionalization and purification conditions can be found in the Protocol section.

Hydrogel synthesis
We polymerised the methacrylated dextran chains by radical polymerisation under cryotropic                          gelation conditions; the polymerisation reaction is carried out at subzero temperatures, with                          frozen water acting as porogen. Dissolved substances are concentrated in the liquid microphase,                          which are small non-frozen regions in the mixture. In this phase, the gelation of the dextran                          hydrogel occurs, generating a hydrogel with an interconnected macroporous structure. (1) After                          24 hours of reaction at subzero temperature, the gels are thawed, melting the ice crystals                          and thereby removing the porogen. Subsequently, the gels are washed to remove unreacted chains                          or unreacted radical moieties. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to confirm the                          macroporous structure of the dextran hydrogels, as can be seen in the Result section.
Optimization of the dextran hydrogel synthesis conditions
During the optimization process of the hydrogel synthesis, we ran into one major problem:                          the instability of the hydrogels. The first synthesis attempts resulted in very brittle hydrogels                          which could not be used for further experiments. Several conditions were                          investigated to find the optimal polymerisation conditions. First of all, we increased the degree of                          substitution (DS) by adding more glycidyl methacrylate to the dextran functionalisation reaction. A higher                          degree of substitution results in a higher crosslinking degree, which would hopefully result in more stable hydrogels. (1) Using Scanning Electron Microscopy, it was determined that a degree of substitution of 60 yields the optimal microstructure.                          Attempting to enhance the stability of the hydrogel further, we investigated different concentration ranges of the radical polymerisation                          initiating compounds TEMED and APS. Varying the concentration of both compounds from 0.2 to 5X the                          concentration described in the paper by Plieva et al. (1) and attempting different combinations,                           did not result in more stable hydrogels. Changing the environmental conditions turned out to be essential.                           By carrying out the initiation at 4 °C, we could delay the onset of the polymerisation reaction and allow ice                           crystals to grow more rapidly in the gel. These new environmental conditions with the standard chemical equivalents of APS and TEMED,                           resulted in firm and strong hydrogels.

Characterization of the degree of substitution
The degree of substitution (DS) of the methacrylated dextran chains was characterized using 1H-Nuclear                          Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy based on the method described in the paper by Plieva et al. (1) The                          spectrum was measured in D2O. The DS is calculated as (100x)/y, where x is the average integral of                          the protons at the double bond at δ 5.7 and δ 6.1 ppm and y is the integral of the anomeric proton                          at δ 4.8 ppm. The 1H-NMR spectrum can be seen in figure 3, which is the same spectrum as the one reported in                          the paper. (1) Our methacrylated dextran has a degree of substitution of 60.
Microstructure characterization with Scanning Electron Microscopy
To characterize the microstructure of our dextran hydrogels, we performed Scanning Electron                          Microscopy experiments. For the exact experimental details about these experiments                          and sample preparation, see the Protocol section. We could confirm that our hydrogel forms a                          super macroporous structure, with  pores on the micrometer scale. In figure 4, you can see the                          microstructure of our hydrogel at different length scales.

Generating different hydrogel prototypes
We adapted the shape and size of our hydrogels depending on the experiment.                          Below the different prototype gels we created can be seen.
Patch prototype
This hydrogel (figure 5) was synthesized to investigate if the outcome of our modeling experiments can be realized with our hydrogel. The modeling results showed that a thin hydrogel with a thickness of approximately 1 mm would be the thinnest hydrogel still capable of killing S. aureus effectively. As we want our hydrogel to be as thin as possible while remaining effective, we synthesized this 0.75 mm thin hydrogel to demonstrate that our hydrogel material is suitable for creating such a thin patch. We could demonstrate that a hydrogel of this thickness could be synthesized and handled, illustrating that our ideal patch that we have modeled can also be produced in reality.

Hydrogel with cavity
This prototype (figure 6) was used to improve the consistency in the adhesin experiments. Polydimethylsiloxane molds were created                          in collaboration with Dr. Manoj Sharma through which a glass rod can be inserted halfway into the centre of the gel. Pouring                          the polymerizing gel mixture into this mold results in the synthesis of the cubic cavity hydrogels.

Columnar shaped hydrogel
We created columnar shaped hydrogels varying from a 96-well plate volume (figure 7) for the initial adhesin                          experiments to a 1 mL columnar shaped hydrogel for modeling experiments.

Collaboration iGEM Hamburg team 2018
As a collaboration, the iGEM Hamburg team 2018 was looking for a suitable hydrogel for their project.                          They desired a hydrogel that is stable under acidic conditions, is non-toxic, and                          non-degradable. We sent our hydrogel, and iGEM Hamburg team 2018 tested our hydrogel on all these different                          requirements. Our hydrogel turns out to be remarkably stable under varying conditions which exceed the tolerance of most common bacteria.
