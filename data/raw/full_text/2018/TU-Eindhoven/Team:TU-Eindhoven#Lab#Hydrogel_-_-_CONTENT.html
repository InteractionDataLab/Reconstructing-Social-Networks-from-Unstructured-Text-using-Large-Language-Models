                    in which glycidyl methacrylate derivatized dextran is polymerized into super 
                    macroporous dextran hydrogels. The subzero temperature polymerization conditions 
                    employed in this paper result in an interconnected supermacroporous hydrogel with 
                    pores ranging from 1 to 100 micrometer. This unique morphology allows for the rapid 
                    and non-restricted mass-transport of solutes of virtually any size and has already 
                    been used as a matrix for cell seeding.<A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A> Therefore, this paper has 
                    been used as a starting point for the synthesis of our hydrogel.

                            they first need to be functionalized. As dextran source we used dextran 500kDa 
                            polymer of pharmaceutical quality, kindly provided by Pharmacosmos. Each polymer 
                            chain has a weight of approximately 500kDa, and therefore consists of approximately 
                            three thousand glucopyranose units. Based on the methods described in the article 
                            by Plieva <EM>et al.</EM><A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A>, we decided to functionalize the dextran polymer chains by 
                            methacrylation. Subsequently, the methacrylated dextran molecules can be polymerised 
                            into a covalent hydrogel network via radical polymerisation.<A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A> 
                            The methacrylation reaction using glycidyl methacrylate is illustrated in figure 1. We designed the reaction in 
                            such a way that for every 100 glucopyranose units, 60 glucopyranose units are 
                            functionalized with a methacrylate group (a degree of substitution (DS) of 60). 
                            The resulting reaction mixture of this reaction can be seen in figure 2. Exact details 
                            about the functionalization and purification conditions can be found in the 
                            <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Protocols">Protocol</A> section.</P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

                                </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><H3>Hydrogel synthesis</H3><P>We polymerised the methacrylated dextran chains by radical polymerisation under cryotropic 
                        gelation conditions; the polymerisation reaction is carried out at subzero temperatures, with 
                        frozen water acting as porogen. Dissolved substances are concentrated in the liquid microphase, 
                        which are small non-frozen regions in the mixture. In this phase, the gelation of the dextran 
                        hydrogel occurs, generating a hydrogel with an interconnected macroporous structure.<A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A> After 
                        24 hours of reaction at subzero temperature, the gels are thawed, melting the ice crystals 
                        and thereby removing the porogen. Subsequently, the gels are washed to remove unreacted chains 
                        or unreacted radical moieties. We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to confirm the 
                        macroporous structure of the dextran hydrogels, as can be seen in the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Results">Result</A> section.</P><H3>Optimization of the dextran hydrogel synthesis conditions</H3><P>During the optimization process of the hydrogel synthesis, we ran into one major problem: 
                        the instability of the hydrogels. The first synthesis attempts resulted in very brittle hydrogels 
                        which could not be used for further experiments. Several conditions were 
                        investigated to find the optimal polymerisation conditions. First of all, we increased the degree of 
                        substitution (DS) by adding more glycidyl methacrylate to the dextran functionalisation reaction. A higher 
                        degree of substitution results in a higher crosslinking degree, which would hopefully result in more stable hydrogels.<A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A>
                        Using Scanning Electron Microscopy, it was determined that a degree of substitution of 60 yields the optimal microstructure. 
                        Attempting to enhance the stability of the hydrogel further, we investigated different concentration ranges of the radical polymerisation 
                        initiating compounds TEMED and APS. Varying the concentration of both compounds from 0.2 to 5X the
                         concentration described in the paper by Plieva <EM>et al.</EM><A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A> and attempting different combinations, 
                         did not result in more stable hydrogels. Changing the environmental conditions turned out to be essential. 
                         By carrying out the initiation at 4 Â°C, we could delay the onset of the polymerisation reaction and allow ice 
                         crystals to grow more rapidly in the gel. These new environmental conditions with the standard chemical equivalents of APS and TEMED, 
                         resulted in firm and strong hydrogels.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Results</H2><DIV class="figureWrapper figureRight"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

                        The degree of substitution (DS) of the methacrylated dextran chains was characterized using 1H-Nuclear 
                        Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy based on the method described in the paper by Plieva et al.<A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A> The 
                        spectrum was measured in D<SUB>2</SUB>O. The DS is calculated as (100x)/y, where x is the average integral of 
                        the protons at the double bond at Î´ 5.7 and Î´ 6.1 ppm and y is the integral of the anomeric proton 
                        at Î´ 4.8 ppm. The 1H-NMR spectrum can be seen in figure 3, which is the same spectrum as the one reported in 
                        the paper.<A href="#hydrogelref1">(1)</A> Our methacrylated dextran has a degree of substitution of 60.

                        To characterize the microstructure of our dextran hydrogels, we performed Scanning Electron

                        and sample preparation, see the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Protocols">Protocol</A> section. We could confirm that our hydrogel forms a 
                        super macroporous structure, with  pores on the micrometer scale. In figure 4, you can see the 
                        microstructure of our hydrogel at different length scales.

                        This hydrogel (figure 5) was synthesized to investigate if the outcome of our modeling experiments can be realized with our hydrogel. The <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Model">modeling results</A> showed that a thin hydrogel with a thickness of approximately 1 mm would be the thinnest hydrogel still capable of killing <EM>S. aureus</EM> effectively. As we want our hydrogel to be as thin as possible while remaining effective, we synthesized this 0.75 mm thin hydrogel to demonstrate that our hydrogel material is suitable for creating such a thin patch. We could demonstrate that a hydrogel of this thickness could be synthesized and handled, illustrating that our ideal patch that we have modeled can also be produced in reality.

                        As a collaboration, the iGEM Hamburg team 2018 was looking for a suitable hydrogel for their project. 
                        They desired a hydrogel that is stable under acidic conditions, is non-toxic, and 
                        non-degradable. We sent our hydrogel, and iGEM Hamburg team 2018 tested our hydrogel on all these different
