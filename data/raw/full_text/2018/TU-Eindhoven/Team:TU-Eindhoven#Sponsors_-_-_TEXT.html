Stichting PAMM
Stichting PAMM
PAMM gave us financial support, but also helped us a lot with or research with Staphylococcus Aureus, which is a             category 2 bacteria. Therefore, we were not allowed to work with that bacteria. PAMM has been testing our lysostaphin             on plates with Staphylococcus Aureus for us. These experiments have been essential in proving that our lysostaphin is             both secreted and able to kill the S. aureus bacteria.
PAMM foundation is a research center for medical microbiology and infectious diseases and for pathology in Veldhoven             and Eindhoven. They collaborate with general practitioners and hospitals in the region, the Dutch national health             institutes (GGD) and health facilities. As a prominent research institute, PAMM values innovation in its research             field and is working on diagnostics, consultation and prevention of diseases. Visit them on http://www.pamm.nl
