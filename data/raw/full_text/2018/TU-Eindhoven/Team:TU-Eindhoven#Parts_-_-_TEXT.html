Parts overview
To realize our designed parts, we gratefully made use of the IDT Synthesis offer,                          allowing easy and fast access to the desired DNA constructs. All parts are codon                          optimized for expression in E. coli, the workhorse of our project. For all our composite parts,                          the comprising basic parts were registered separately on the Registry, to allow future iGEM teams to                          use our constructs in new assemblies. All parts we shipped to the registry are sequence confirmed.
During the 2018 Giant Jamboree, BBa_K2812004 was nominated by the jury for Best New Basic Part in the Overgrad competition. BBa_K2812005 was nominated by the jury for Best New Composite Part in the Overgrad competition.
