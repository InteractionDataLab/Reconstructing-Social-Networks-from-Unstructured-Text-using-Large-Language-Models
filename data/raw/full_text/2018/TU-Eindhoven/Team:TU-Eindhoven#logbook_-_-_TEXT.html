The gels that incubated overnight were transferred to new medium with roughly equal OD and then were induced for protein expression.

EDTA should chelate the calcium and denature the Adhesin, causing the cells to detach from the gel.

A transformation into C2987 cells was done for the pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D 1 (gave colonies), or pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D 2 (no colonies) constructs.
PCR analysis
A PCR analysis was performed on the constructs pSTV-HlyB/D 1, and pSTV-HlyB/D 2. We ran an agarose gel and analyzed the results with the UV reader. Both contained a lot of different bands, however the band at the right size was very bright.

Colony PCR
Colonies with the sugar binding domain, lysostaphin-HlyA, pyocin-HlyA and pBAD-pyosin-HlyA in pSB1C3 are analyzed with colony PCR. The amplified DNA is analyzed on an agarose gel.
Preparing samples for sequencing
Samples for sequencing are prepared with pSB1C3 plasmids with sugar binding domain, lysostaphin-HlyA, pyocin-HlyA and pBAD-pyosin-HlyA.
Ligation and transformation T7-lysostaphin
The T7-lysostaphin in pTET 24a is transformed into BLR cells. The transformed cells are plated and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

Colony PCR (biobrick)
A colony PCR from 10 colonies was performed on C2987 cells containing pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D 1 plasmid.
PCR analysis
A PCR analysis was performed on the pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D 1 construct. However, no bands were visible.
Small cultures
Small cultures were made of pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D and pET24a-HlyA + pSTV-HlyB/D.
Inducer mixture
An inducer mixture was prepared containing 1 mL IPTG (100 mM), 5 mL arabinose (2 M) and 1.25 mL calcium (2 M).

Washed the cells
To make sure no antibiotics are on the cells we wash them twice with LB.
PAMM
This time we wanted to test the diffusion of Lysostapin in our hydrogel. We used the gels with the cavity and loaded them with 7 μL of cells. Those cells did not contain the sugar binding protein. We saw that there was a dead zone around the gel but also some cells leaked out.
