                    Using the power of synthetic biology, new genetic circuits can be engineered to yield smart, responsive 
                    and adaptive materials and devices capable of performing 
                    advanced functions. Our organism of choice for such a material is <EM>E. coli</EM>, 
                    the workhorse of synthetic biology. In designing and realizing such a complex material,
                     we applied the following universal engineering principles:
                </P><UL><LI><B>Modularity</B>: Our design consists out of separate parts that 
                    we individually characterize and optimize before integrating them into a coherent system</LI><LI><B>Reproducibility</B>: Our design must yield reproducible results &amp; behaviour in our experiments</LI><LI><B>Prototyping</B>: To test the performance of our design, we create prototypes which we can rapidly test to adapt our design</LI><LI><B>Safe-by-Design</B>: During the design process, we consider safety in an integrative way right from
                    the start. Please also see our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices#ethics-container">Safe-by-Design page</A> for more information on how we implemented
                    this engineering principle during our project.</LI></UL><P>No concept is convincing without a concrete application scenario. Therefore, we divided ourselves
                  in two groups, one group working on the living material itself and one working on the application
                  scenario necessary to illustrate the potential of living materials to the general public.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-3 col-lg-2 col-xl-2 toc-column"><DIV class="toc-wrapper"><LI><UL id="tableOfContent"><P>The best that most of us can hope to achieve in physics is simply to misunderstand at a deeper level.</P></UL><A class="backToTop" onclick="topFunction()">▲</A></LI></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-9 col-lg-10 col-xl-8 docs"><SECTION><H2>Living Materials as Platform for New Technological Innovations</H2><P> Current challenges impeding the successful realization of living materials are the demanding requirements for a viable environment for living 
                        organisms and biosafety concerns regarding the escape of genetically modified organisms into the environment <A href="#designref1">(1)</A>. These issues led to design requirements, 
                        preferences and constraints that apply to our living material. These are general concepts, since the living material we propose can be used for many different applications. For each application, more specific criteria would apply. We go into more detail in our application scenario of a living material as a patch for burn &amp; chronic wound healing (see below).</P><P><UL><B>Requirements:</B><LI>Modularity: The living material must be capable of performing different functions by exchanging the type of incorporated genetically engineered <EM>E. coli</EM>.</LI><LI>(Bio)safety: The living material must be designed in such a way that it is safe for both the users and the environment. This necessitates that bacterial leakage is prevented and the material 
                            is non-toxic and biodegradable.</LI><LI>Viability: The living material must be a permissive environment for <EM>E. coli</EM>, allowing their survival and functioning in the material for a prolonged periods of time.</LI><LI>Robustness: The living material must be able to withstand and function in a variety of conditions it might be subjected to in a real world application.</LI></UL><UL><B>Preferences:</B><LI>Affordability: The production and maintenance of the living material is at a reasonable cost for the application.</LI><LI>Ease of manufacturing &amp; scalability: To allow widespread use of this new technological innovation, production should be straightforward and allow for upscaling of the manufacturing procedure to industrial scale.</LI><LI>Sustainable: The living material and its production process must be environmentally-friendly.</LI><LI>User friendliness: The material should be easy to use by the end user for a certain application.</LI></UL><UL><B>Constraints:</B><LI> Considering the expertise of our department in <EM>E. coli</EM> biology compared to other bacterial strains, <EM>E. coli</EM> was the only logical candidate bacterial platform for our project.</LI></UL></P><P>Our material of choice for a living material is a hydrogel, a polymer network with water as dispersion medium. Hydrogels are inherently biocompatible, permeable and have a high water content. 
                        This makes them an ideal matrix for living materials <A href="#designref1">(1)</A>. Their use as cell
                      delivery vehicles <A href="#designref2">(2)</A> and scaffolds for tissue engineering <A href="#designref2">(3)</A> proves 
                      their suitability as a viable environment for micro-organisms. We quickly realized that our hydrogel has conflicting demands. 
                      It should prevent bacterial escape but also have an open porous structure to allow free diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, 
                      signaling molecules and proteins. Simple physical entrapment of the bacteria would therefore not suffice. We envisioned 
                      that the solution to this conflict is to actively tether <EM>E. coli</EM> tightly to our material. In this way, we prevent the 
                      diffusion of <EM>E. coli</EM> out of our gel while allowing the free transport of solutes. Our hydrogel-anchor combination should 
                      thus act as a sort of prison, keeping the <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria alive and functional, but restricting their movement. 
                      The concept of <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> was born.

                      adhesin to anchor the <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria to the hydrogel. Recently, a large 1.5 MDa <A class="tooltipsBtn" data-target="adhesinTooltip" onclick="showTooltips(event);">adhesin</A> was
                      found in the Antarctic bacterium <EM>Marinomonas primoryensis</EM>. This large adhesin, named
                      <EM>M. primoryensis</EM> ice-binding protein (<EM>Mp</EM>IBP), is 0.6 µm long and consists of more than 130
                      domains. Its structure is shown in Figure 1. 120 of these domains encode for the same immunoglobin-like β-sandwich that rigidifies
                      upon binding of Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> and acts as extender projecting the binding 
                      domains positioned on top of the chain into the medium <A href="#designref4">(4)</A>.
                    </P><P>
                      In our design process, we envisioned that
                      we could use the sugar binding domain of <EM>Mp</EM>IBP, to bind to a sugar-based polymer. 
                      In this way, we can tether the <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria to our hydrogel. 
                      On the other parts of the wiki, we will
                      refer to the shortened version of <EM>Mp</EM>IBP including the sugar binding domain as
                      ‘adhesin’.
                    </P><P>
                      In its native host, the <EM>Mp</EM>IBP adhesin is exported out of the cell using the single-step
                      type I secretion machinery.  The type I secretion of the adhesin requires four protein
                      domains. Hemolysin A (HlyA) is a protein domain C-terminal to the adhesin protein,
                      signaling for type I secretion. Hemolysin B (HlyB), Hemolysin D (HlyD) and TolC are
                      the other proteins which are responsible for forming a trans-periplasmic export channel
                      upon interaction with the HlyA domain, as shown in Figure 1 <A href="#designref4">(5)</A>. 
                      In type I secretion, all
                      proteins passing the β-barrel pore of TolC, a constitutively expressed outer membrane protein<A href="#designref4">(6)</A>, must remain unfolded <A href="#designref4">(4)</A>. The RIM
                      and RIN domains of the adhesin (see Figure 1) are the only domains that fold
                      independent of calcium. Calcium is naturally present in millimolar concentrations in
                      sea water, the natural environment of <EM>M. primoryensis</EM>. The entire adhesin is translocated
                      to the extracellular space where the domains fold, but the RIM and RIN domain are already
                      folded in the cytosol and prevent translocation through the TolC protein. The RIM protein fits inside the
                      TolC pore, with the RIN being a bulky anchor preventing total release of the adhesin. The RIM &amp; RIN domain act as a TolC β-barrel plug <A href="#designref4">(4)</A>. The translocation process of the adhesin is shown in figure 2. After translocation, the HlyB/D complex is recycled. In our design, we want to use this
                      ingenious system to express the adhesin on the surface of <EM>E. coli</EM>. However, the native
                      adhesin is too large to be produced in <EM>E. coli</EM>. To avoid problems with expressing 
                      the adhesin in <EM>E. coli</EM>, the amount of RII repeats in the gene encoding the adhesin was reduced to 15.

                      it must be non-toxic to <EM>E. coli</EM>. The microstructure of the hydrogel must be <B>open and porous</B>, allowing efficient
                      and fast nutrient, oxygen and solute exchange. The hydrogel must be <B>mechanically stable</B>
                      to prevent bacterial leakage. The hydrogel must <B>not degrade</B> over a sustained period of time and synthesis should be

                    </P><P>Dextran is a polymer that consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose (glucose) residues.
                      This glucose-based nature makes dextran an ideal polymer for our <EM>Mp</EM>IBP adhesin to bind to.
                      Dextran is non-toxic, has been investigated for tissue engineering applications, and
                      is already used in the clinic as blood plasma substitutes <A href="#designref8">(8)</A>. A hydrogel from dextran
                      polymer chains can be synthesized using radical polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylated
                      dextran <A href="#designref9">(9)</A>. By adapting the protocol of Plieva <EM>et al.</EM><A href="#designref9">(9)</A>, we designed a supermacroporous dextran hydrogel
                      with pores ranging from 1 to 100 micrometer that meets our requirements. This unique morphology
                      allows for the rapid and non-restricted mass-transport of solutes of virtually any size <A href="#designref9">(9)</A>.

                      When this yielded mechanically unstable hydrogels, we examined different combinations of degree of substitutions of dextran, equivalents of

                    To demonstrate the functionality of the dextran-adhesin combination,

Our hydrogel is stable at
                        physiological conditions for months and can be stored in a dried state and re-swollen prior
                        to use, avoiding availability problems <A href="#designref8">(9)</A>. Dextran is already approved by the FDA for
                        clinical use for plasma volume expansion, antithrombotic agent and peripheral flow promotion
                        <A href="#designref9">(10)</A>. Furthermore, the hydrogel can be easily sterilized using radiation
                        <A href="#designref10">(11)</A>. For this application scenario, FDA approval for the polymerized methacrylated dextran, possible degradation products, 
                        and the integration of engineered <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria is required.

                        To target <EM>Staphylococcus aureus</EM>, a Gram positive bacteria, 
                        we use lysostaphin. Lysostaphin is a zinc endopeptidase that cleaves the pentaglycine
                        cross-bridges present in the bacterial cell wall of <EM>S. aureus</EM>. Lysostaphin exhibits its
                        lytic effect not only against regular <EM>S. aureus</EM>, but also against methicillin-resistant
                        <EM>S. aureus</EM> (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant <EM>S. aureus</EM> and <EM>S. epidermidis</EM>. Recently, it was
                        demonstrated that hydrogels delivering lysostaphin outperform prophylactic antibiotic
                        treatment and soluble lysostaphin treatment in murine femur fracture models <A href="#designref12">(12)</A>. The
                        iGEM teams <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:HIT-Harbin">HIT-Harbin 2012</A> and <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Stockholm">Stockholm 2016</A> have used lysostaphin before in their
                        projects to target <EM>S. aureus</EM>. However, both teams relied on cell lysis to free the
                        lysostaphin. For our application, this approach is not suitable as releasing bacterial cell
                        lysate into the wound will only act as food for the bacteria causing the infection.
                        Moreover, cell lysis does not offer a solution for sustained release of lysostaphin. The
                        solution to this problem is to make lysostaphin secretable. This will allow sustained release
                        of the active enzyme and ensures that the lysostaphin reaching the wound is of high purity.
                    </P><H3>Enabling secretion</H3><P>
                    Different strategies for secretion of recombinantly expressed proteins exist <A href="#designref13">(13)</A>.
                    To minimize the burden on our modified <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria that are already expressing <EM>Mp</EM>IBP adhesin,
                    secretion of lysostaphin should use the same type I secretion system. To achieve this, 
                    the C-terminal HlyA signal peptide must be fused to lysostaphin. In designing the construct encoding for such a fusion protein, 
                    we first codon optimized the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K748002">HIT-Harbin 2012 truncated lysostaphin construct</A> and fused it to HlyA via a thrombin linker. 
                    Secretion of lysostaphin circumvents the use of cell lysis, improving the biokiller device developed by <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:HIT-Harbin">HIT-Harbin 2012</A>.
                    The thrombin linker was chosen with other iGEM projects in mind, as it can be readily cleaved by the thrombin enzyme. For protein detection and 
                    purification purposes, we added a His-tag C-terminal to the HlyA domain.</P><P>After assembly of this construct, protein expression and functional experiments in collaboration with the PAMM foundation, 
                    the regional center for infectious diseases and pathology of South East Brabant in the Netherlands, were performed. To prove the functionality and secretion of the lysostaphin in collaboration with PAMM, we 
                    devised a number of experiments. First, cell lysate was tested on <EM>S. aureus</EM> to show the functionality of lysostaphin. This
                    experiment was followed by testing the of the medium, to see whether lysostaphin is being secreted by the cells. Finally, as ultimate
                    test of the secretion and functionality of the lysostaphin, co-cultures were grown with <EM>S. aureus</EM> and our induced bacteria. All 
                    these experiments were performed with <EM>Streptococcus agalactiae</EM> as a negative control, a Gram positive bacteria similar to <EM>S. aureus</EM>, but not 
                    susceptible to lysostaphin. The HlyA domain itself is also used as a control, to eliminate HlyA as source of lytic activity against <EM>S. aureus</EM>.

                    we learned that besides <EM>S. aureus</EM>, <EM>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</EM> is also a major cause of problems in wound care of patients 
                with burn and chronic wounds. As our lysostaphin-HlyA has a modular design, we changed the coding sequence of lysostaphin to that of pyocin S5, generating a new <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2812007">biobrick</A> in addition to lysostaphin. 
            Pyocin S5 is a bacteriocin against <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM><A href="#designref14">(14)</A>, enabling our patch to target both <EM>S. aureus</EM> and <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM> simultaneously. This demonstrates 
        the modularity of our patch, of which the concept is illustrated in figure 7. We also learned about the importance of a kill switch and included this in our design. Please see our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">Applied Design</A> section for the kill switch and for an analysis of the potential impact of our bacteriocin secreting patch.
        </P><P><A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Model">Model results</A> were used to adapt the hydrogel shape to suit our wound healing application. We modelled which patch thickness would be feasible to create a patch that is as thin as possible, but also allows enough lysostaphin to reach the skin to kill <EM>S. aureus</EM> using experimental input as lysostaphin production rate and hydrogel paramters such as microstructure. Our model showed  that a patch with a thickness of the order of magnitude of approximately a millimeter allows a high enough concentration of lysostaphin to kill <EM>S. aureus</EM>. Subsequently, we adapted our hydrogel patch design to synthesize a <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Lab/Hydrogel">hydrogel</A> patch with a thickness of 0.75 mm. We could show that this hydrogel could be easily created and yielded flexible, stable hydrogels. For our wound healing application, we could develop a relevant prototype due to the modeling results.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Summary of our design</H2><P>The core of our project consists out of three DNA constructs; the secretable lysostaphin, the type I secretion system proteins HlyB/D and the <EM>Mp</EM>IBP adhesin. 
            To comply with the engineering principle of modularity, each of these three constructs is under to control of a different promotor. This allows individual manipulation of 
            each component. Additionally, to maintain the plasmids during division of the bacteria, each construct has an unique origin of replication. To confirm uptake of all three plasmids, each construct has a different antibiotic resistance. 
            The three main construct designs of our project can be seen in figure 8. We used experimental data to model the ideal prototype hydrogel for the wound healing application, and subsequently used these outcomes to optimize our patch design and synthesis.</P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame" style="max-width:490px;"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>Figure 8.

                        least in duplo and repeating them multiple times we ensured the reproducibility of our results. Via integration
