                University of Technology. Topic of the thesis was the self-assembly of designed molecules into helical architectures
                in water. Subsequently, he moved as a Humboldt fellow to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund,
                to work on the protein semi-synthesis and evaluation of lipidated Ras GTPases in the group of prof. Herbert Waldmann.
                From 2003-2004 he worked as a group leader in the medicinal chemistry department of Organon (now Schering-Plough) in
                Oss, on nuclear receptor medicinal chemistry.
                
                End of 2004 Luc Brunsveld received the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, with
                which he established his own research group at the MPI of Molecular Physiologie, Dortmund, beginning 2005. He worked
                on the combination of supramolecular chemistry with protein biochemistry and cellular biology, generating new
                approaches to modulate biological processes. In 2006 he became group leader at the Chemical Genomics Centre of the
                Max Planck Society, Dortmund. Here he was working on the chemical biology of nuclear receptors to understand and
                modulate the nuclear receptor-cofactor interaction, in close collaboration with Bayer-Schering Pharma, Merck-Serono,
                and Schering-Plough. In the middle of 2008 Luc Brunsveld received an ERC starting grant and became full professor in
                chemical biology in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In his
                research Luc Brunsveld uses chemical biology approaches to study protein-protein interactions. Two general themes
                are: 1) Supramolecular Architectures are being pursued as instruments to modulate protein-protein interactions and
                2) the Nuclear Receptor – Cofactor interaction is being investigated as a specific protein-protein interaction with
