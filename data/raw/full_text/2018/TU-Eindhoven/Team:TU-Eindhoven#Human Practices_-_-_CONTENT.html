When we started our brainstorm sessions in March, we had no clue which topic we wanted to explore. Yet, we wanted it to be relevant to society. During these first months, we got the opportunity to interact with experts and the public to discuss our ideas. These encounters were of great help in our topic selection. During a visit to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Rathenau Instituut (Dutch organization for technology assessment), we realized that the lack of a safe platform for working with GMOs outside of controlled environments is a problem on itself that deserves a solution. We were excited to tackle this issue with Gelcatraz, but also wanted to work towards a more concrete application. In the time that followed, we consulted several experts and interacted with the public to get feedback on our proposals. Once we had settled on the wound healing application, we interacted with more stakeholders and experts to shape the design of the wound healing patch. We also performed a stakeholder-value analysis  and an ethical analysis  of our design, and we considered safety during all stages of the project for safe-by-design. We realize that our project would not have been the same without the Human Practices.</P><P>In the following section, we share the insights we gained from interactions with stakeholders and experts during the three main stages of the project: <A href="#findingaprojectH2"><B>finding a project</B></A>, <A href="#findinganapplicationH2"><B>finding an application</B></A> and <A href="#shapingthedesignH2"><B>shaping the design</B></A>.

Finding a project</H2><P>Thanks to the TU/e Contest and various brainstorm sessions, we had settled on the living material project. Although we decided to focus on the adhesin system, we wanted to demonstrate the potential of our platform by applying it to a social problem. To find the ‘perfect’ application, we consulted various experts, interacted with the public and attended a biotech conference. We also reflected on the ethical consequences of our potential applications before settling on wound infections.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="timeline"><DIV class="tl-event left"><DIV class="tl-content docs"><H3>February &amp; March </H3><P>Initially, we considered a wide range of topics, from glucose sensors to
                        solar energy, and from ocean clean-ups to artificial organs. The number
                        of options seemed unlimited, and our search was scattered. As a source of
                        inspiration, we consulted newspaper articles, checked the wiki pages of
                        previous iGEM teams and talked to several professors at our university.
                        When going through the wiki pages of previous teams, we realized that
                        many of them  struggled with the use of their creations outside of the
                        laboratory. We also came across an article by Liu et al. (2017), who
                        attempted to design a ‘living material’ by means of several layers used
                        to entrap bacteria. Inspired by this cool work, we decided we wanted to
                        do something similar in order to facilitate the easy use of GMOs.
                        However, instead of using several layers for entrapment, we wanted to
                        equip our bacteria with their own anchor. After several brainstorm
                        meetings, we settled on this challenging subject as the goal of our
                        2018 iGEM project!

This is an annual ideation contest organized by our university, in which students are encouraged to develop their innovative ideas into start-ups. The contest was intended for students who already had a clear idea that they wanted to bring to the market. Unfortunately, our project was still quite vague (‘adhering bacteria to a hydrogel’). Nevertheless, our participation was still useful. We got to meet companies, participate in workshops and pitch our project to the public.

And there are some (non-ideal) alternatives which guarantee a reasonable quality of life, which makes it more difficult to find people willing to take the risk of incorporating living GMOs into their body. However, our hydrogel may still be helpful if we turn it into a composite of hydrogel and granules. But for the scope of this project (limited time), she instead recommended us to focus on skin infections. She believes it is very promising. Furthermore, the need for it will only grow as people live longer. This means they develop more decubiti’s and more metabolic syndromes, which in turn increases the risk of skin infections.

Furthermore, we had realized that the use of GMOs in the body would bring undesired safety hazards. For this reason, we eliminated the bone healing and kidney regeneration applications from our list. Thanks to our ethical analysis, we had realized that applications relevant to the Western world would be preferable over Third World applications from a justice point of view. This issue made us prefer the wound infections application over needleless vaccines and malaria sensors. Finally, the application must be feasible, as it would not be the initial focus of our laboratory work (this is the gel-adhesin system). As several teams had already been working on skin infections or related subjects (e.g. burn wounds) and several antibacterial proteins (bacteriocins) had been described in the literature, the skin infections topic met this requirement. A final important criterium was that the use of living GMOs must be beneficial compared to existing solutions in order to justify the use of living bacteria. We believed we could meet this requirement in two ways: firstly, by developing a secretable bacteriocin, we eliminate the need for (expensive) protein purification. Secondly, the use of living systems enables the relatively straight-forward integration of sensing and secretion.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="timelineHead"><DIV class="round" style="padding:10px 30px;background-color:#eee;"><H2 id="shapingthedesignH2">III. Shaping the design</H2><P>Once we had decided to focus on wound healing, there were many new questions to be answered by the Human Practices team. How to offer patients suffering from infected wounds the best possible treatment? Is there indeed a need for a new treatment? What requirements does our material need to fulfill? What are the medical details of the wounds? Which bacteria do we need to kill? To collect answers to these questions and many more, we contacted several experts and stakeholders.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="timeline"><DIV class="tl-event left" id="plasmacure"><DIV class="tl-content docs"><H3>July 3, 2018.

                        Plasmacure is a start-up aiming to cure chronic wounds, especially diabetic wounds,
                        with plasma (fourth phase of matter). They developed a small machine producing
                        plasma which can be connected to a disposable plaster. The plaster is applied to
                        the wound. During a one-minute treatment, the wound is exposed to plasma. This
                        should be enough to kill all bacteria and fungi on the wound. This treatment is
                        repeated ten times. The product is still under development, but the first small
                        clinical trial showed positive results for half of the patients.  During a meeting
                        with their CMO Koen Lim, Lim was so kind to sketch the wound market and its
                        problems, to share his solution and to give us feedback on our plans. We also
                        learned about the long and winding trajectory of bringing a medical device to the
                        market. This resulted in our problem sketch.</P><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-target="#plasmacureModal" onclick="openModal(this)">

Its implementation is also efficient, as the required tRNA and synthetase are easily producible by bacteria. Van Hest recommended us to start with only one point mutation. Multiple mutations would be saver, but could complicate the synthesis of essential proteins, leading to cell dead.</P><P>Another topic we discussed with Van Hest, is the option to replace the use of antibiotic resistance genes in R&amp;D by dependence on artificial amino acids.

Van Hest informed us that dependence on artificial amino acids could be a serious alternative, albeit not much used yet. He said that currently researchers simply use antibiotic resistance genes because of their ease of use and wide availability. However, dependence on artificial amino acids as a selection mechanism may be even more reliable than antibiotic resistance, as bacteria tend to get rid of genes that are temporarily unused, e.g. in the absence of antibiotics.

Burn wound center Maasstad Ziekenhuis</H3></DIV><DIV class="modal-body"><P>After getting changed into a blue apron (burn wounds a very prone to infections indeed), we were welcomed by what seemed to be the entire team of the burn wound department. Dr. Dokter and colleagues told us that the treatment  of (antibiotic-resistant) bacterial infections is high on their priority list. This is because burn wounds are never sterile, since they are always colonized by bacteria. The goal of the medical team is to contain the bacteria and to prevent them from developing into an infection, as this could be lethal. Currently, containment is done through systemic use of antibiotics, mechanical cleaning of the wounds and/or antibacterial creams. However, they recently observed an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, meaning that an alternative like ours would be very welcome. They told us they would already order some patches if possible. 😉They also foresaw benefits for the patients, as wound dressings must be changed regularly: two times a week for small burn wounds, and even daily for larger ones. As changing is painful for the patients, it would be great to use a wound dressing like ours which could stay on the wound for a prolonged time while ensuring drugs are administered to the wound.</P><P>Although they were very enthusiastic about our product, they also saw some room for improvement. Their advice was to complement lysostaphin with other systems to target different bacteria. Bacteria found by the Maasstad burn wound center in burn wounds include Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococci, Pseudomonas (e.g. P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Enterobacter, E. coli, Serratia, Proteus, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter baumanii. However, not all of these are of equal danger. S. aureus is recently getting more problematic because of a surge in dangerous toxin-producing strains found in burn wounds. This is also what drew Dokter’s attention to our project. Other strains considered particularly toxic are Streptococci, Pseudomona, Klebsiella and Enterobacter. General, Dr. Dokter told us that Gram-negative bacteria pose a higher threat to patients than Gram-positive ones. The team also warned us that bacteria such as S. aureus growing in biofilms are particularly challenging to get rid of. They were thus very happy to hear that lysostaphin targets bacteria growing in biofilms.</P><P>Another problem recognized by the medical practitioners regarding the current treatment methods is the systemic use of antibiotics which increases the risk of resistance. To find out which bacteria contaminate the wound, they usually culture them. However, this takes four days, forcing the doctors to use systemic antibiotics to prevent the outbreak of an infection. As the systemic antibiotics used are not specific, this treatment contributes to antibiotic resistance while the treatment may not even be effective against the specific bacteria colonizing the wound. Once the results of the culture are known, a more specific treatment is selected. The medical team therefore believed it would be very beneficial if we could expand on our patch by integrating a sensing system, to secrete the appropriate type of bacteriocin only when the relevant bacteria are present. This would decrease the risk of resistance developed against our bacteriocins drastically. They said it would be great if we could include different types of bacteria secreting different bacteriocins in combination with a sensing system, as it would directly improve the treatment efficacy and prevent building antibiotic resistance.</P><P>We would like to once again thank Jan Dokter and the entire team of the Maasstad burn wound center for their hospitality and kind feedback. Inspired by some in-depth knowledge of the most problematic bacterial strains and the requirements for wound healing and encouraged by your positive feedback, we will continue our efforts to improve our design even further! 😊</P><H4>Insights</H4><UL><LI>Burn wounds are always colonized, meaning that it is crucial to control and limit the bacteria growing in the wound.</LI><LI>Burn wounds are colonized and potentially infected by several bacterial strains.

It would thus be important to demonstrate that E. coli cannot escape the patch. If we achieve this, it would be great to regulate the production and secretion of various bacteriocins through a sensing system. Peters expects that upon the extermination of one bacterial strain, other (malignant or benign) ones may take over.

The decision about what you need to do with a wound is very simple. It is based on color! If a wound is black, that means that there is necrotic tissue which has to be removed. If the wound is of a yellow color, the wound is not yet clean and there are still some remains of bacteria or tissue left. This means that the wound has to be cleaned, but there is no dead tissue. A red color means that the wound is not contaminated, but still needs to be protected and covered. These are things that we must take into account when designing a patch for wound infections.  We were also told that the amount of exudate of a wound is very important. If a wound is too dry, it will not heal. Is there too much fluid? Not optimal either. Treating a dry wound is performed by the addition of a hydrogel to increase the fluid levels of the wound. In that respect, our gel would provide an ideal environment for dry wounds.</P><P>After some information about the wound healing process, we asked about wound-related statistics. It turns out that of all wounds, about 80% are acute and will heal on their own without too much care. However, 20% will become chronic and of these 20%, more than half will get infected and thus requires attention. These wounds are estimated to be approximately 100.000 wounds. This means that in the Netherlands, 100.000s wounds annually could benefit from our solution.</P><P>Since an antibiotic treatment usually takes around ten days, it would be good to aim at removing the infection in ten days or less with our solution.

Thanks to their continuous input, we learned for which applications our living material would be most relevant. This made it much easier to settle on a wound healing patch as an application for Gelcatraz. A further set of interactions with medical doctors, experts on infectious diseases and others helped us to get a clear overview of the problem at hand. This helped us tremendously in the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">product design process</A> . It was extremely motivating to experience the enthusiasm of medical doctors when we told them about our project. This inspired us to work even harder! These experts also had interesting advice for improvements on our design. As a result of the stakeholder and expert interactions described above, we took several decisions and made adaptations. Summarized:</P><UL><LI>The choice for dextran as our hydrogel of choice was confirmed by a discussion with Prof. Patricia Dankers.</LI><LI>Input from RIVM experts, Dutch biotechnologists, dr. Sandra Hofmann, and an anonymous dermatologist made us decide on wound healing as our field of application. This decision was further informed by a discussion with ethicist Dr. Lily Frank, during which we realized that a product for our own country is preferred over one aimed at developing countries considering a fair distribution of risks.</LI><LI>We researched the chemical safety of our hydrogel and its synthesis after advice from Lori Goff and risk assessment expert Cécile van der Vlugt. We <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Lab/Hydrogel">demonstrated</A>  the chemical safety of the final product and proposed some adaptations to improve the future safety of the synthesis.</LI><LI>Thanks to a visit to Plasmacure, we decided to research the requirements for a patch against burn wounds and against diabetic wounds. This resulted in visits to the Maasstad Hospital (burn wound center), Expertise Center Wound Care, and in calls with a patient suffering from chronic wounds and an expert on diabetic wounds and infectious diseases. We learned that besides <EM>S. aureus</EM>, <EM>Streptococci</EM> and <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM> would be our main targets for diabetic wounds and burn wounds, respectively. We designed an additional <A href="link to registry page for Pyocin S5.">BioBrick (pyocin S5)</A> to target <EM>P. aeruginosa</EM> and we selected an existing BioBrick to inhibit <EM>Streptococci</EM>.</LI><LI>Several stakeholders stressed the importance of safety. Therefore, we designed a kill switch  as an additional safety level, based on advice from Prof. Jan van Hest.</LI><LI>The doctors in the Maasstad Hospital and from the VUmc made us realize that a sensing mechanism to regulate our secretion system would be a great asset.

                        She is an assistant professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of
                        Technology and is specialized in Biomedical Ethics. With Lily we discussed the
                        potential benefits and dangers of synthetic biology, and she pointed us at some
                        of the most controversial issues related to synthetic biology. For instance,
                        Lily strongly recommended us not to choose an application which must be tested in developing
                        countries. Instead, we should test our product close to home where the required
                        infrastructure for safe testing is available. Furthermore, we learned that the
                        relative novelty of synthetic biology  as a field combined with slow politics
                        complicates risk assessment, as many of the potential benefits and risks are still
                        uncertain or have been ignored.
                    </P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Ethical frameworks</H2><P>Lily was so kind to suggest some ethical frameworks to get started with our ethical discussion. She particularly recommended frameworks resulting from the European project SYNBIOSAFE (2009) and from work performed by the US Presidential Commission on Bioethics in 2010 <A href="#ethref1">(1)</A>. As Europeans, we were quite interested in the European view on the SynBio case. However, we found the European framework a collection of potential issues and concepts rather than a framework useful for an ethical analysis. As Lily Frank shared our preference for the American framework, we decided to use this one for our analysis. In the discussion, we also touch upon some points extracted from SYNBIOSAFE.</P><P>We realize that some of the positions taken by the US Presidential Commission are themselves debatable. However, we consider it beyond the scope of this ethical analysis to debate the framework. In the next section, we will briefly explain the used framework before applying it to our project <EM>Gelcatraz</EM>.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Analysis</H2><P>The American report <I>New Directions: The Ethics of Synthetic Biology and Emerging Technology (2010)</I> was a result of six months of work commissioned by president Obama, in response to the development of the first self-replicating artificial bacterial cell in 2009 <A href="#ethref1">(1)</A>. For six months, they consulted approximately thirty experts and received written comments which discussed the risks and benefits of synthetic biology. The commission concluded that synthetic biology should be approached with “prudent vigilance”. This means it is not necessary to implement new regulations or even discontinue research in the field of synthetic biology, but that the developments of the field should be continuously monitored. They invite scientists and public policy makers to assess the risks, benefits and moral objections   of new projects and their implications, and they strongly advice to engage stakeholders, scientists and the public in this debate. In fact, such evaluation is well captured by iGEM’s Human Practices process.</P><P>The commission found <B>five guiding principles</B> for the evaluation of synthetic biology processes and products: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice &amp; fairness. Below, we discuss our project in the context of each of these five values.</P><H3>1. Public beneficence</H3><P>The value public beneficence is defined as the maximization of public benefits and the minimization of public harm. This principle should be applied to the individual, institutional, community and public levels. The commission advises to be vigilant about harms.</P><P>Our entire human practice trajectory was performed with the aim of optimizing public beneficence and minimizing the harmful side effects of our design. For instance, we ensured optimal entrapment of bacteria in the gel, designed a kill switch to minimize the risks associated with bacterial escape, added an additional bacteriocin to our secretion system to eradicate additional malignant bacteria and researched the options for replacement of toxic chemicals during the synthesis of the hydrogel. This process is documented on the <A href="#hpTop" data-target="#safe-container" onclick="changeHPTabs(this)">safe-by-design</A> page. The final bandage resulted from input from stakeholders and expert on our designs. This process was further supported by a <A href="#hpTop" data-target="#stakeholder-container" onclick="changeHPTabs(this)">stakeholder-value analysis</A>  we performed based on the iGEM'ers Guide to the Future.</P><P>We believe that our product benefits individuals as well as society, by improving patients’ quality of life, improving public health, lowering the prevalence of antibiotics resistance and eventually reducing health care costs.   These benefits are extensively explained on the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">applied design page</A>. For instance, we enabled the secretion of active lysostaphin by E. coli. This eliminates the need for expensive laboratory equipment other than the standard equipment available in modest laboratories for the production and purification of lysostaphin. This will allow scientists with all budgets to produce lysostaphin of high purity. Currently, drugs sold in developing countries are often of lower purity than drugs used in developed countries <A href="#ethref2">(2)</A>. Hopefully, patients in developing as well as developed countries will benefit from a treatment with highly pure lysostaphin.</P><P>We identified the main risk introduced by our design as the escape of GMOs into the environment. We however believe that we minimize this risk using a proper adhesin. We consider the addition of a kill switch to our system in the future. This will add an additional layer of safety to <EM>Gelcatraz</EM>. However, it will make the system more expensive. This may not be desirable as it may prevent scientists with a limited budget from using our platform. In contrast, without the kill switch, the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">low costs of our system</A> and its user-friendliness make <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> accessible to any scientist with basic equipment.</P><H3>2. Responsible stewardship</H3><P>The committee believes that scientists involved with SynBio must think and act for the advancement of all, thus also for those who cannot talk. Examples of the latter are nonhuman species, the environment and future generations. Challenges recognized by the commission are firstly our incomplete and uncertain understanding of the potential risks and benefits of synthetic biology, and secondly the risk of intentional misuse of SynBio technologies. Once again, the commission stresses the importance of prudent vigilance here, rather than being action-oriented or extremely cautious.</P><P>Insofar as we can judge with our current knowledge, the plaster as we designed it seems to globally advance people. Patients suffering from chronic wounds or burn wounds will benefit from the plaster, and so will other people as our design diminishes the burden of antibiotic resistance. It may be argued that animals also benefit from the latter, as they also suffer from bacterial infections. Moreover, the plaster could replace current antibiotics administered to livestock. Things get more complicated when we consider <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> as a platform for GMO use outside of the laboratory. By making working with GMOs safer and more convenient, we may accelerate the use of GMOs in regulated environments as well as in less controlled environments. The desirability of the widespread use of GMOs could be the topic of a separate ethical discussion and is beyond the scope of this analysis. Nevertheless, we should only launch our system for use outside of laboratories if the safety of our device can be demonstrated and regulations should ensure that only GMOs classified as <A target="_blank" title="e.g. biosafety level 1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_level">‘low-risk’</A> are allowed. When people use <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> within a laboratory environment, they do not need special equipment to work safely with the platform.</P><P>Another reason why prudent vigilance would be important comes from the dealing with novel technologies which have not yet been thoroughly tested. Interestingly, SYNBIOSAFE highlighted the need for new risk assessment methods in three cases: a) when larger DNA-based circuits are built based on individual ‘parts’, b) when new minimal organisms are designed and c) when alternative biochemical structures are involved <A href="#ethref3">(3)</A>. The first case is generally applicable to iGEM with its emphasis on BioBricking. Although we do build new circuits, their complexity remains limited. This means that the functioning of the circuits should remain predictable, limiting the additional risks involved. We also tested our constructs thoroughly. The latter two cases are not directly related to our project, but the third one may be if we implement an artificial amino acid-based kill switch. Although we would implement the kill switch to enhance the safety of our design, we should be aware of the level of unpredictability added by such a novel biochemistry. The authors do not elaborate on the type of risk assessment methods they envision. However, the need for new risk assessment methods means that we must take a vigilant stance during the design process.</P><H3>3. Intellectual freedom and responsibility</H3><P>Here, the risk of malevolent ‘dual-use’ should be recognized. That is, the abuse of SynBio technologies for dubious cases. The commission does not believe that this risk is high enough to justify the limitation of intellectual freedom. Instead, it calls for “regulatory parsimony”: no more surveillance than strictly required to ensure justice, fairness, security, and safety, as this may hamper progress of science and technology and may even prevent the development of safeguards. SYNBIOSAFE is more careful with respect to dual-use. They believe that the risk of intentional misuse has been neglected in previous discussions.</P><P>In this context, it is problematic that we cannot control the type of applications that we will facilitate with <EM>Gelcatraz</EM>. This means that we may potentially facilitate the use of GMO for harmful ends. However, the question is whether people using GMOs for dark purposes will benefit from our design, as we designed <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> with an emphasis on safety. People aiming to abuse GMOs probably do not care much about safety and may therefore not turn to our platform.</P><P>SYNBIOSAFE also addresses the possible diffusion of synthetic biology to amateur biologists. Considering that <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> has been designed not only for safety but also for convenience, it may offer an interesting platform to amateurs. This may be worrisome if amateurs are not aware or do not care about appropriate safety measures. We therefore agree with SYNBIOSAFE’s call for regulation and training in biosafety techniques. However, our platform has been designed as a platform for the use of already manipulated and tested bacteria. This means that only ‘amateurs’ capable of the initial steps needed to, for instance, equip their bacteria with the required adhesin. We therefore do not believe that our platform will attract fully inexperienced users.</P><H3>4. Democratic deliberation</H3><P>The presidential commission stresses the importance of an ongoing public debate and the search for common grounds on a topic so controversial as synthetic biology. The commission argues that decisions need not to be binding, as new information may challenge those decisions. Instead, the deliberative process should be ongoing. However, the commission seems to assume that the general public knows enough about synthetic biology to formulate an opinion. We think that often, the required knowledge is missing. Therefore, it may be good to inform people about the field of synthetic biology before asking them for their opinion. It is important that the provided education is objective. We believe that the democratic deliberation process is very much encouraged by the iGEM competition in the form of education and outreach, and feel that it is reflected by <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Edu_n_Public_Engagement">our outreach efforts</A>.</P><H3>5. Justice and fairness</H3><P>The commission calls for a fair distribution of benefits, burdens and risks across society and globally. We opted for an application which is relevant for people all across the globe, as Staphylococcus aureus is everywhere <A href="#ethref4">(4)</A>. To fairly distribute the risks, <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> as a platform and the resulting wound plaster must be extensively tested in the Netherlands before making it available to other countries. That will ensure that (clinical) tests are performed in a setting with all the required safety precautions. Once <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> is considered safe to use, it can be adopted by anyone with access to a laboratory with standard equipment. As no special equipment is required for the safe use of <EM>Gelcatraz</EM>, scientists with all budgets may benefit from its use. As discussed above, patients will globally benefit from lysostaphin secretion and its integration in a wound healing plaster.</P><P>Although the main benefits of our design will be enjoyed by a certain group of patients, the entire (Dutch) society and even world will benefit from reduced antibiotics resistance. Escape of bacteria, although unlikely, would mainly affect patients and their surroundings. The effects would however be minimal thanks to the several layers of security (weakened, benign bacterial strain unable of survival outside of the hydrogel). From the safety analysis performed for the <A href="#hpTop" data-target="#safe-container" onclick="changeHPTabs(this)">safe-by-design</A> challenge,  it can be concluded that people exposed to our platform for their jobs (e.g. medical doctors, nurses, people working in waste processing or manufacturing) will not suffer from this.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Conclusions</H2><P>In this ethical analysis, we reflected on our <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> design with respect to five values: public beneficence, responsible stewardship, intellectual freedom and responsibility, democratic deliberation and justice &amp; fairness. We conclude that our product benefits individuals as well as society, and that its benefits and burdens are well-distributed.  We identified some issues that need to be addressed, such as the use of <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> by amateurs and the yet unidentified risks introduced by synthetic biochemistries. However, we believe that these risks are mostly covered by the several safety levels we integrated in the design.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>References</H2><OL class="reference"><LI id="ethref1">Gutmann A.

                            of genetically modified organisms. Environmental escape not only is a risk that should be
                            avoided out of public and environmental safety reasons, but also contributes to public fear
                            of GMOs (<A href="#sbdref1">1</A>). We consulted several RIVM experts who confirmed that escape risk is a limiting
                            factor in the advancement of GMO technologies. Environmental safety threats related to GMO
                            escape includes the damaging of ecosystems, the risk of horizontal gene transfer and effects

                            learned that the use of systemic, unspecific antibiotics contributes to the development of antibiotic
                            resistance, as described under Product Design . 
                        </P><P>To contribute to a solution for the treatment of antibiotic resistant infections, we designed our living

                            and development is not an urgent problem, as the quantities used are low, and the types of antibiotics
                            use are generally basic ones. For those antibiotics, many alternatives still exist in the unlikely case
                            of resistance developed due to research work. Nevertheless, we asked <A onclick="changeHPTabs(this)" data-target="#intergrated-container" href="#vanhest">professor Van Hest</A> about the
                            possibilities of replacing the commonly used antibiotic resistances with a dependence on artificial
                            amino acids. He said that, albeit not yet used, dependence on artificial amino acids as a selection
                            mechanism may be even more reliable than antibiotic resistance. The reason is that bacteria tend to get
                            rid of genes that are temporarily unused, e.g. in the absence of antibiotics. As genes related to
                            artificial amino acid dependence generally encode for essential proteins, they do not run this risk.</P><P>In conclusion, our project offers a solution to the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic
                            resistant bacteria. We already reflected on ways to prevent resistance against our own bacteriocins.

                            chemicals. Furthermore, some toxic intermediates are produced.  While handling these chemicals, we
                            take all required precautions such as working in the fume hood and wearing protective gloves.
                            However, it would be even better to replace them by less toxic equivalents. We researched
                            replacement options for two steps: the synthesis of methacrylated dextran and polymerization of
                            methacrylated dextran into gels.
                        </P><H4>Synthesis of methacrylated dextran</H4><P>For the synthesis of the gel, we use some toxic chemicals, the most important being glycidyl
                            methacrylate (GMA) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). GMA is carcinogenic but required to
                            functionalize the hydroxyl groups of dextran. We handle it with syringes to avoid exposure.
                            Furthermore, we remove all traces of GMA after the synthesis and confirmed this with H-NMR.
                            The final product is thus completely safe. DMAP is a base that acts as a catalyst for the
                            coupling of GMA to the dextran molecules. It is toxic if swallowed and fatal in contact with
                            skin. In the absence of a catalyst, no GMA incorporation could be detected (5). However, we
                            researched alternatives to catalyse the reaction. Triethylamine and pyridine are no reasonable
                            alternatives due to the associated high conversion times (5).  Another alternative for DMAP
                            could be tri-ethylenediamine, also known as DABCO. DABCO is like DMAP an organic base and
                            therefore it can theoretically catalyse the methacrylation reaction. However, unlike DMAP,
                            DABCO possesses less toxic properties and DABCO is much safer to handle than DMAP. DABCO is
                            from an economical point of view also a better choice as its commercially available for a lower
                            price. A downside to using DABCO as a catalyst for this methacrylation reaction is that it is
                            less basic than DMAP (6). As the deprotonation of hydroxyl groups by a base is the driving force
                            for the reaction, the reaction time will most likely increase when DABCO is employed as a
                            catalyst instead of DMAP. A comparison of the performance of DABCO in our reaction is required
                            to make an informed choice between DMAP and DABCO.
                        </P><P>Methacrylation of the non-hazardous dextran results in molecules with very toxic and carcinogenic
                            properties due to the reactive methacryl groups (7).  No material safety data sheet exist for
                            methacrylated dextran. To safely handle this toxic viscous oil, it is kept in the fume hood at
                            all times and only handled using piston pipettes or syringes. To purify the methacrylated
                            dextran from the organic mixture, <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Protocols">we dialyse it against demineralized water</A>. To verify the

                            dialysis, trace amounts of unidentified by-products could be observed in the NMR spectrum. After
                            one week of dialysis, no more trace amounts of any reactants or byproducts can be observed. The

                            polymerisation in water. The polymerisation is initiated by tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
                            and ammonium persulfate (APS). TEMED catalyses the homolytic scission of APS to generate
                            radicals which crosslink the methacrylate groups, resulting in the formation of a hydrogel. APS
                            and TEMED are both flammable and irritable. Because TEMED is a catalyst, we only work with
                            small amounts of the substance (10 microliter at a time) using pipets, reducing the risks
                            associated with this compound. TEMED is vital for the liberation of radicals from APS. In the
                            absence of TEMED, polymerisation at room temperature by solely APS is slow, so at -20°C the
                            polymerisation would be even slower <A href="#sbdref5">(5)</A>.
                        </P><P>Recently, an alternative approach to crosslinking methacrylated dextran polymers into a hydrogel
                            is has been developed, using radiation instead of the APS TEMED system. This approach
                            circumvents the use of toxic crosslinkers. If the methacrylated dextran monomers are pure,
                            the crosslinked hydrogel is devoid of unreacted small molecules and no further purification
                            is necessary. Additionally, if a high enough radiation dose is applied, typically 25 kGy, the
                            gel is sterilized simultaneously allowing immediate seeding. Crosslinking by radiation is
                            therefore a very promising option for dextran hydrogel synthesis on an industrial scale <A href="#sbdref7">(7)</A>.

                            into a hydrogel. Aqueous waste is water with small amounts of organic molecules dissolved in it.
                            In our case these are organic molecules are the solvent DMSO, DMAP, unreacted GMA and methacrylated
                            dextran, NaOH, HCl, synthesis byproducts and byproducts formed during the radical polymerisation
                            (including unreacted methacrylated dextran). None of the waste products can be recycled due to
                            dilution or contamination with other compounds.
                        </P><P>Especially during dialysis, a large amount of aqueous waste is generated. Approximately 50 liters
                            of aqueous waste is produced for 80 mL of hydrogel. The amount of waste can be drastically reduced
                            by changing using a smaller dialysis volume. We used a dialysis volume of 4 litres to accelerate
                            the dialysis. If a smaller volume would be used and equilibrium between the dialysis bag and the
                            medium is established each time, we expect that we can halve the amount of waste, at the cost of a
                            longer purification duration.
                        </P><H4>After use</H4><P>The dextran-GMA hydrogel is biodegradable and is therefore safe to use in ecological environments.
                            The bacteria are equipped with a kill switch which will also kill the bacteria after the patch
                            has served its function and is thrown away. In this fashion waste production is kept at a minimum.
                        </P><H3>Costs</H3><P>We are using a dextran hydrogel for our system. Medical-grade dextran is expensive. However, the
                            production of one hydrogel only requires small quantities (100 μg). Therefore, the estimated
                            dextran costs for making one 400 μL hydrogel in patch form is around €0,65. Adding other reagents
                            will bring the total costs to approximately €1,00 for one hydrogel in small scale conditions.
                            These costs can be optimized by upscaling. Modifying the bacteria is a one-time expenditure.
                            Afterwards they can be cultured and re-used for a long period. Culturing the bacteria can be
                            performed on a large scale. Costs of medium are very low. Overall, our living material can be
                            produced very cost-efficiently and upscaling would further reduce cost. Before seeding our
                            hydrogel with bacteria, they can be modified for expression of different proteins. By also
                            culturing these bacteria that express infection-reducing enzymes, patches that fight infections
                            can be created by a very modest increase in costs.
                        </P><H3>Conclusion</H3><P>Although we use toxic chemicals for the synthesis of the hydrogel, they are removed by extensive
                            dialysis of the methacrylated dextran resulting in a biocompatible end-result. Furthermore, a
                            leakage test showed that no leakage occurs from the gels over a period of two weeks. This means
                            that the chemicals do not yield any risk for users of the bandage. The use of a novel,
                            radiation-based crosslinking method and alternative catalysts could reduce the toxicity of the
                            synthesis and polymerization reactions, which would be beneficial for manufacturers. The gel is
                            biodegradable, and its production is relatively cheap.

                            The enzymes that will be secreted by our patch need to be safe in human systems. Lysostaphin is one of these enzymes.
                            Lysostaphin efficacy has been extensively tested in murine and rabbit models, confirming its effectiveness against
                            S. aureus causing several types of infections (e.g. nasal, orthopaedic implants, abscess lesions, aortic valve
                            endocarditis) <A href="#sbdref9">(9–11)</A>. In those cases, lysostaphin treatment was reported to be non-toxic <A href="#sbdref11">(11)</A>. Clinical studies must
                            be performed to confirm these statements. Therefore, clinical trials are necessary to show that lysostaphin causes
                            no harm when it enters the body through the wound. Although most bacteriocins have no effect on human cells in low
                            concentrations, less is known about higher concentrations. Besides lysostaphin, our E. coli will produce pyocin, a
                            bacteriocin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pyocin has been shown to be effective against P. aeruginosa lung
                            infections in mice, with its required dose 100-fold lower than the commonly used antibiotic tobramycin <A href="#sbdref12">(12)</A>. It
                            still needs to be determined whether it is safe in humans, but there is no indication it will be.
                        </P><P>The hydrogel that we use is biocompatible and has been used in humans before. However, GMA that is necessary for
                            the synthesis is highly toxic and carcinogenic.  Dialyzing the methacrylated dextran product for one week ensures
                            complete removal of GMA. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to verify that during storage in
                            demineralized water, no dextran or other starting products leak from the hydrogel . Therefore we know it is safe to
                            use for an application on the skin. The trace amounts of organic material that do leak out could not be assigned to
                            any known reagents or (by)products but it was collected from the 50 mL of storage water. This means that the presence
                            of organic materials in the storage water can be neglected as their concentration is extremely low.
                        </P><P>The strains of E. coli (BL21(DE3) and BLR) that we use do not present a direct threat to human health, plants or
                            microorganisms, since it is an biological agent of category 1 (13–15). This means that it is very unlikely that they
                            are harmful to humans. Besides the bacteriocins that are secreted, E. coli has been modified to express a number of
                            different proteins. As mentioned above, these proteins are harmless.
                        </P><P>In conclusion, to make our gel user friendly and safe, we used a hydrogel that is not hazardous and is safe when in
                            contact with living organisms. Our E. coli strain is harmless. However, it must still be confirmed that the used
                            bacteriocins are safe to humans. To this date there is no indication that it the bacteriocins would be any more
                            hazardous than conventional antibiotics.

Therefore,
                            it is important to make an inventory of the possible existing hazards. Thinking about our “hydrogel patch”,
                            possible hazards are the dextran material, the diffusion of lysostaphin and pyocin and the bacteria that are
                            inside the gel. As we discussed above under patient safety, both of theseboth molecules seem safe to humans.
                            The same applies to the E. coli strain used. Obviously, it remains important to wash hands before and after
                            handling the patch or touching the wound.
                        </P><P>
                            Moreover, to work healthily and safely, is it also important that the gel can be applied easily. Therefore,
                            it should not require much physical work and should not be harmful for the nurses. It would be beneficial
                            if the plaster looks normal, something that feels familiar to the patient and nurse. It should not give
                            them the idea that there are living modified bacteria inside the plaster itself to prevent scaring patients
                            or medical professionals.

                            From our conversations with medical professionals, we learned that the plaster will need to be replaced
                            regularly. To prevent pain or inconvenience to the patient or nurse, the plaster must thus be easy to
                            apply and to remove.  As the plaster will be delivered in a sterile package ready for application, the
                            application should be straightforward and easy. This requirement is thus met. Overall, it can be
                            concluded that our plaster will not make the work of nurses or doctors any more difficult or dangerous

                    </P><P><SPAN class="moreinfo" data-target="infiltration" onclick="showMore(event);">More information</SPAN></P><DIV class="explanation disappear" id="infiltration"><P>Several experts and stakeholders asked us whether the risk exists that foreign bacteria infiltrate <EM>Gelcatraz</EM>.
                            Infiltration would form a serious safety hazard. What if malignant bacteria colonize the material and use it to secrete
                            toxins to patients? We thus researched this issue and consulted several experts on the topic.
                        </P><P>In principle, we do not think that the risk of infiltration is high, as ‘our’ <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria secrete toxins. This
                            does not make the material an attractive environment for foreign bacteria, or at least the targeted ones. Once we
                            will have incorporated a broad spectrum of toxins to be secreted on demand, the risk of infiltration by malignant
                            bacteria will be minimal.
                        </P><P>What remains, is the risk of non-targeted bacteria infiltrating the gel. Think of benign bacteria present on our
                            skin, which will be attracted by the nutrient-rich environment of the gel. Although this will not pose a
                            safety-hazard, it would be problematic when they outcompete <EM>E. coli</EM> and consume the nutrients. It is, however,
                            more likely that <EM>E. coli</EM> remain the dominant species, as they are present in large amounts.  As foreign bacteria
                            lack the binding affinity for Dextran that our <EM>E. coli</EM> have, this will only happen when the gel forms a
                            sufficiently attractive environment and when they can live together symbiotically with <EM>E. coli</EM>. This is not
                            necessarily a bad thing, such as in the case of mutualism or commensalism. Whether this happens, will need
                            to be tested experimentally. In case it happens, we researched some preventive measures.</P><H3>Changing the plaster</H3><P>A simple measure may be frequent replacement of the plaster. This would ensure fresh nutrients and fresh <EM>E. coli</EM> bacteria. A disadvantage of this is inconvenience for the patient, which was highlighted by doctors from the Maasstad Hospital. Clinical studies will need to show the optimal treatment duration and replacement frequency.</P><H3>Quorum Sensing</H3><P>Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate activities on a larger scale. This is mostly intraspecies but the molecule AI-2 (Autoinducer 2) has been suggested to be a universal quorum sensing molecule, allowing inter-species communication. Production of this molecule has been found in a wide range of both gram-positive and gram-negative species, by means of the protein LuxS <A href="#sbdref11">(11)</A>. By implementing a luxS knockout in our own bacteria, combined with an AI-sensing gene we can induce production of bactericides upon invasion of unwanted bacteria into our living material. A similar mechanism has also been attempted by <A href="https://2008.igem.org/Team:NTU-Singapore">NTU-Singapore 2008 iGEM team</A>.</P><H3>Silver coating</H3><P>Many metals have antibacterial properties (oligodynamic effect), but silver is the most effective and the least toxic to humans <A href="#sbdref16">(16)</A>.

They recognized the problem of bacterial overcrowding within our construct. Since our bacteria will keep dividing and cannot escape the hydrogel, at some point bacteria will be over-saturated which can lead to problems in protein expression  or even dead. They offered to help us, and we had a meeting with them over skype. They were making a construct that uses the Lux Quorum sensing. Their construct contained 3 plasmids: Luxl (synthase for AHL), LuxR (molecule where AHL binds and can then bind to promotor) and pLux (promotor to which LuxR +AHL can bind). When the promoter gets activated, a phage lysis gene will be synthesized. In our case they offered to send us the plasmids without the Luxl in the construct, so when we add AHL to the hydrogel medium, cell growth will be inhibited. This is a great solution to keep our bacteria in control, as we want them to stay in steady numbers within our hydrogel, with steady lysostaphin production.

                      with our product, we performed a stakeholder-value analysis. This analysis was inspired by the
                      <A href="https://www.rri-tools.eu/-/igemer-s-guide-to-the-future">iGEM'ers Guide to the Future</A>.
                      We started with a brainstorm session during which we settled on the relevant stakeholders and values.
                      This gave us a good overview of who we wanted to talk to and what we wanted to discuss with them.
                      Inspired by interactions with stakeholders and readings, team members filled the matrix with post-it
                      notes over the course of the summer. Afterwards, we analyzed the findings. We will shortly discuss
                      the most important beneficial aspects of our project to the stakeholders and the main problems to
                      overcome in the stakeholders’ interests.

Since it is a gel-like structure, treatment will be painless and continuous, reducing stress and effort to get the treatment. Placement of the patch can take place at home and replacement should be done less often compared to band aid. This not only reduces stress, inconvenience and pain as we learned from the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices#Maasstad">Maasstad burn wound center </A>, but fewer actions will also reduce costs. As developers of the patch it is also our task to make it chemically safe. The chemicals secreted by the bacteria in the patch are harmless to humans and have no known side-effects, but the chemicals used to produce the gel are very toxic on their own. To reduce the risk of these compounds, our gel is washed several times after synthesizing to remove those chemicals. However the possibility is also there to replace them with less toxic chemicals. Overall, patient safety seems to be guaranteed. The issues of patient safety and chemical toxicity are discussed under <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices#safe-container">safe-by-design</A>.</P><H3>Scientists/iGEM</H3><P>We, the scientists working on the wound healing patch, have the main responsibility to make the product as safe as possible for every stakeholder. The safety aspect for us or other scientists working on this patch is again safely handling the chemicals used. This means taking the necessary safety precautions like wearing gloves or work in a fumehood etc. Decreasing toxicity of the chemicals by replacing them with less dangerous compounds will also greatly help with safely working on this patch.</P><H3>Physicians</H3><P>Physicians have the general responsibility to get people the best treatment possible. Our wound healing patch helps physicians provide the best treatment, since it our patch is specific for long lasting, infected wounds. The specificity of the bacteria that are killed by the patch has the advantage of reducing chances of developing resistances among a lot of other bacteria on the skin. Resistant bacteria are already a problem in infected wounds, as emphasized to us by the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices">medical doctors</A> we interacted with. Another advantage of the patch for physicians is the fact that it can be freeze-dried and thus stored effectively for a long time and is ready off-the-shelf. This makes prescriptions and availability easier.</P><H3>Hospitals</H3><P>Hospitals have similar interests as physicians: fighting resistant bacteria via the reduced use of common antibiotics and easy storage through freeze-drying. At the same time, limiting the treatment cost is a high priority for hospitals.</P><H3>Nurses</H3><P>For the people applying the patch, the nurses, ease of application is important. This is ensured by designing the patch like band-aid. This is also important for their skills on using it, as not much has to be changed in their training or surroundings to learn how to apply such a patch. However, as they are the ones handling the wound healing patch, they are concerned by making the patch as safe as possible as well. Reducing chemical toxicity is their main interest along with the fact that the bacteria inside the gel do not pose a risk to the nurses.</P><H3>Insurance companies</H3><P>Our contact at <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices">Plasmacure</A>, Koen Lim, had been working for several insurance companies. He could thus inform us about the wound care market, as we described on the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">Applied Design</A> page. Koen Lim expected that our product will drastically decrease health care costs once it is fully functional. Wound care currently costs Dutch society over 3 billion euros (1), so a cost reduction would be welcomed by insurance companies.</P><P><SPAN class="underline">Society</SPAN></P><P>As the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria is a major problem for society, it is our responsibility to reduce the systemic use of these antibiotics. We are trying to achieve this by using bacteriocins, and not common antibiotics to reduce the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria. Another thing that we have to take into account however is that there is fear among people about the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). People are afraid of potential dangers. As an iGEM team, it is thus importance to increase awareness of the benefits of GMOs as well as of the danger of and preventive measures against antibiotic resistance. On top of that, we should highlight the additional safety layers introduced by our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Applied_Design">design</A>. We tried to contribute to this through our <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Edu_n_Public_Engagement">education and outreach</A>.</P><P><SPAN class="underline">Government</SPAN></P><P>The government is responsible for regulations to ensure GMO safety. As <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> introduces a safer method of working with GMOs outside of the laboratory, it may form an incentive to reconsider the regulations in certain cases. Obviously, this should only happen when the safety is guaranteed and will require a social debate. Furthermore, the government is faced with the problem of antibiotic resistance. Charged with the responsibility of finding a solution, the government would most likely welcome our alternative treatment of wound infections. Lastly, the treatment of infected wounds is an extremely expensive business due to repetitive, costly treatments. Since our patch would speed up wound healing and reduces costs, it would be beneficial for the government.</P><P><SPAN class="underline">Manufacturers</SPAN></P><P>For manufacturers different topics are relevant. To guarantee the safe production of the wound healing patch, it has to meet the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) every therapeutic has to meet: precise description of production from raw material to fully functional patch. This will establish a safe production process. However, an efficient production process is just as meaningful for manufacturers. The volume in which gel is produced, is scalable and the catalyst used for the gel production is reusable. This is all documented on the <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices#safe-container">safe-by-design</A> page. Unfortunately, in upscaled production, gels are more prone to errors. Testing the gels on the demanded properties is the manufacturers responsibility, but this should be straightforward. Besides being more prone to errors, our gel is not recyclable to make new gels, but the gels can however be stored efficiently using freeze-drying.</P><P><SPAN class="underline">Environment</SPAN></P><P>Low toxicity is of interest to the environment as well as to other stakeholders. The same applies to the prevention of bacterial escape from the gel. To reduce survival rates of potentially escaped bacteria, we use a kill switch. As explained under <A href="https://2018.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven/Human_Practices#safe-container">safe-by-design</A>, this means that survival outside of the gel is not possible for our bacteria. Moreover, our bacteria can easily be killed using regular antibiotics. To conclude, <EM>Gelcatraz</EM> should not pose significant threats to the environments when it is used responsibly.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>References</H2><OL class="reference"><LI id="stakeref1">Meerwaldt R, Das F, Fentener van Vlissingen J, de Lange E, Maessen-Visch MB, van Montfrans C, et al.
