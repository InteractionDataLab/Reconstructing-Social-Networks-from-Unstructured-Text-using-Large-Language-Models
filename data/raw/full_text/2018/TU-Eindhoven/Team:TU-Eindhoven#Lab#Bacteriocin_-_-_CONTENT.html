We succeeded in making the DNA constructs for the Gibson assembly.</LI><LI>Protein expression experiments, in which we ensured that lysostaphin got expressed and secreted.

We observed halo formation around our lysostaphin-producing <EM>E. coli</EM>, but no halo formation around a negative control. These results combined confirm that the eradication of <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM> is due to the lytic activity of lysostaphin produced by our <EM>E. coli</EM>, and not by possible remnants of antibiotics. </LI></OL></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Cloning</H2><P>For the lysostaphin expression and secretion, we needed two plasmids. First, for the lysostaphin expression a plasmid containing Lysostaphin-HlyA-His in a pBAD vector was designed (see figure 2). The HlyA tag on lysostaphin is necessary for the secretion of lysostaphin.</P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

This gene is inserted into two vectors: pTetO and pSTV (see figure 3). Preferably, pTetO was used, since that one has a different inducer than our adhesin protein, allowing for the individual regulation of every protein. However, our supervisors had more experience with pSTV in combination with the secretion system. Therefore we decided to also test this construct for lysostaphin secretion. Our supervisor had already produced the construct pSTV-HlyB/D. Therefore, there is no PCR nor Gibson assembly performed on this construct.</P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>Figure 3.

This was necessary to compare it with lysostaphin secretion and functionality. Our supervisor already had the construct pET24a-HlyA. Therefore there is no PCR nor Gibson assembly performed on this construct. This can be combined with the pSTV-HlyB/D as the pTetO-HlyB/D vector.</P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

To check if the insert was present, a double-digestion was performed using adequate restriction enzymes. The digestion was performed on plasmids purified from three different colonies of C2987 pTetO-HlyB/D and two colonies of C2987 pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His. The bands for pTetO-HlyB/D were expected at 1471 and 4724 bp and pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His at 1450 and 4021 bp.

Protein expression was induced by arabinose. After four hours, cells were harvested and lysed. The protein composition of the lysate was further analysed using SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue. A clear overexpression band at 25 kDa is observed in figure 7. However, the expected size of Lysostaphin-HlyA-His is around 50 kDa, since lysostaphin is 27 kDa and HlyA 23 kDa. We reason Lysostaphin-HlyA-His is performing self-cleavage due to the lysostaphin activity, likely targeting the Thrombin-linker. This is a Glycin-rich peptide. </P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

After 4 hours, the growth medium (LB) was harvested, concentrated (app. 30X), washed, and analysed  using SDS-PAGE. Since the SDS-PAGE stained using Coomassie blue did not show very convincing secretion, a western blot  was performed using anti-his primary antibodies in order to bind the His-tag attached to the HlyA secretion tag. Since the pSTV expression system showed the most promising secretion results, this western blot was only performed on the growth medium of cell transformed with pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His and pSTV-HlyB/D plasmids. </P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

The western blot thus confirms the secretion of the lysostaphin fusion protein.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Functionality Experiments </H2><P>Once secretion had been demonstrated, the last step was the verification of the activity of lysostaphin against <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM>. Those experiments were performed in collaboration with PAMM, the regional center for infectious diseases and pathology of South East Brabant, the Netherlands. We designed the experimental protocols, and the experiments were performed at PAMM, where working with <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM> was permitted (biosafety regulations).</P><P>Three experiments were performed: one with cell lysate, one with cell growth medium and one with cell culture. As a positive control the <EM>E. coli</EM> cells transformed with the plasmids pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His and pSTV-HlyB/D was used on plates seeded with <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM> cultures. pSTV-HlyB/D is chosen for the secretion plasmid since this construct showed the most promising secretion in our <EM>E. coli</EM>. As a control, plates were seeded with <EM><EM>S. agalactiae</EM></EM> (HSB). This is a gram positive bacterium which should not be susceptible to lysostaphin. However, it would be affected if traces of antibiotic were still present in the samples. As an extra negative control we used <EM>E. coli</EM> cells transformed with pET24a-HlyA and pSTV-HlyB/D, which only secrete the HlyA secretion tag. This was added only on plates seeded with <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM>.</P><H3>Cell lysates</H3><P>Cultures of Bl21(DE3) (pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D) and of BL21 DE3 (pET24a-HlyA + pSTV-HlyB/D) were induced using IPTG and/or arabinose and incubated for 4 h. Further cells were lysed using French press and lysates were washed thoroughly. This last step was done to remove any potential traces of antibiotics, in order to exclude antibiotics as a source of bactericidal activity against <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM>. <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM> and <EM><EM>S. agalactiae</EM></EM> were seeded on separate Mueller-Hinton agar plates and 3 µL and 5 µL of <EM>E. coli</EM> (pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His + pSTV-HlyB/D) cell lysate was applied. After an overnight incubation with the cell lysate of our lysostaphin-producing <EM>E. coli</EM> and HlyA producing <EM>E. coli</EM> the results in figure 9 were obtained (3 µL top and bottom left; 5 µL top and bottom right).</P><DIV class="figureWrapper figureMiddle"><DIV class="figureFrame"><DIV class="figureCaption"><P>

Importantly, the experiments show that lysostaphin effectively kills <EM><EM>S. aureus</EM></EM> and MRSA.</P><P>We observed the cleavage of our lysostaphin construct from its secretion tag. Although this was unexpected, it can be explained by the fact that lysostaphin cleaves pentaglycine bridges. A similar structure is also present in the thrombin linker (tetraglycins). As lysostaphin still got secreted and was demonstrated to be functional, we believe the cleavage is not problematic for our purpose.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2>Outlook</H2><P>For further experiments we will make a plasmid containing both the pBAD-Lysostaphin-HlyA-His and pSTV-HlyB/D genetic modules. This is necessary since the vector pSTV shares the same antibiotic resistance as the adhesin protein. The production of a plasmid merging the secretion and the lysostaphin production functions would allow the cotransformation with the plasmid for adhesin production. The primers have already been designed, but due to a lack of time we did not succeed to generate the merged plasmid.</P><P>Furthermore, we would like to expand our system to the production of other bacteriocins, such as Pyocin S5. A gene block containing the pyocin sequence was already ordered, but it has not yet been integrated into the system.</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="imageModal" class="figureModalWindow"><SPAN class="closeFigure">×</SPAN><DIV class="modalCaption">Lorem Ipsum</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container footer" id="footer-container"><DIV class="neat row contactus"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-lg-4" style="background-color: #FF8054"><A href="mailto:igem@tue.nl"><SPAN> igem@tue.nl</SPAN></A><A href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEMTUEindhoven"><SPAN> iGEMTUEindhoven</SPAN></A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
