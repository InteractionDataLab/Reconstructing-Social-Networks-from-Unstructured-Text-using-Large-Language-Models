It's our pleasure to be engaged in these activities and appreciate others' charm.
By inviting junior and graduate students talking us through, we have a better overview of our university's iGEM project in last year. No matter the legendary figure——Pangu in Chinese mythology or the algorithm Pangu named after him , both attracted the biology enthusiasts. Moreover, students form BCU introduced the methods of planting notoginseng, which increased our knowledge.
Undergraduate, high school, junior high students and their instructors together learned from other strong points and close the gap.
