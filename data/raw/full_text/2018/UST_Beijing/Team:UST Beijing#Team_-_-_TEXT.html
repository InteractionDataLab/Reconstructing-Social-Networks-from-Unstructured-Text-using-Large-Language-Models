She loves science and biology because she thinks they can help her to look into the world in another perspective. In normal times, she likes to be with microscope, she believes that these tiny little but incredible things have magic to change the world! Her favorite microbe is Lactobacillus, for they can help produce many different kinds of foods, such as yogurt.
Xuliang Xu

He is majoring in mathematics, which he thinks is drawing him crazy. He joined the iGEM team because he wants to put what he has learnt into use, and also seeing biological system in mathematical way is a very interesting process. His favorite microbe is Extreme Ehemophile, for they are very “old” but strong, they can thrive at relatively high temperatures.

I’ve been deeply attracted by Biology since I was a high-school student. The reason why I am so fond of it is not only because of interests itself, it can help those who are suffering from diseases as well.  Additionally, I’ve always been desiring for knowledge and willing to exchange great idea with others, thus I joint this team to learn new things which definitely broaden my horizons.
