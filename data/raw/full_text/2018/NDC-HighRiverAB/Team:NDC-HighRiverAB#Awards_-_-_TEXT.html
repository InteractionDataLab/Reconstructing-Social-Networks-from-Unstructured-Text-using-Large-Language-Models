aGEM 2018
Recently, our team presented at aGEM 2018, which was hosted by the University of Calgary's iGEM team. We tied with the OLS_Canmore_Canada for the 'Best Value Proposition' Award. This event was a great opportunity for our team to practice presenting before the iGEM 2018 competition, and learn more about other Albertan iGEM team's projects.
