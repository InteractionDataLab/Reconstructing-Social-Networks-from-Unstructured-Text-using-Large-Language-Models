Entrepreneurship
After meeting with our local wastewater treatment plant, we learned that there would likely be a high demand for our project in the wastewater treatment industry. A bacteria that is able to break down fat would significantly help reduce costs, so wastewater treatment plants would probably be willing to invest in it. Our wastewater treatment plant in High River has already expressed interest in using our bacteria, and we have discussed locations where it would be possible for us to integrate our bacteria into the existing system. We have also met with a representative from Cargill to see how our project could be used in their facilities, and they are excited about working with us. Additionally, Amino Labs has created individual synthetic biology kits which are available for people to use at home, and they are interested in collaborating with us to incorporate our bacteria into their product.
