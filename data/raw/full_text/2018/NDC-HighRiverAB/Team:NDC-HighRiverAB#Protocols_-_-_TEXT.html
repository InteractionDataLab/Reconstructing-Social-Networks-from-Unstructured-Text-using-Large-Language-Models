Protocol
We used general protocols as well as our own protocols for testing our gene and gathering quantitative data. You can find all of them below.
General Protocols
Our general protocols come from the Lab Protocol Manual from the 2016 University of Lethbridge Synthetic Biology Workshop 2016.
Below is a copy of our lab protocol manual:
Proof of Concept Protocol
Our mentor, Robert, helped us adapt the lipase assay from Gupta et. al..
Below is our modified version:
Spectrophotometry Protocol
Using our above Proof of Concept Protocol, we modified it slightly to test the same reaction but getting quantitative data from the spectrophotometer as the reaction progresses. We did this with help from the University of Calgary, specifically Cassie Stillner.
Note:
- 25uL of 50mM IPTG was added to a 50mL culture.
- We used a 400nm wavelength during the spectrophotometer measurements
Below is our modified version:
