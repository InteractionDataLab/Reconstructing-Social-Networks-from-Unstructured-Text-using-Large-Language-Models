University of Calgary iGEM
One major challenge of working in a high school classroom is we don’t have access to most sophisticated testing equipment such as a spectrophotometer. As such, although we were able to show that our bacteria could break down fats by observing a color change, we were not able to generate any quantitative data – only qualitative. When we were at aGEM (an Alberta-focused iGEM competition), the University of Calgary team offered to establish a collaboration to help us run a quantitative experiment on our bacteria in their lab. We got to visit their lab on several occasions and they helped us design a time course experiment with proper controls to test in their spectrophotometer. We did some practice runs and then ran our actual experiment. They helped us design and run the test, as well as analyze our data and create a figure. This helped us see the rate of the enzyme breaking down the ester bonds of the test compounds (4-nitrophenyl palmitate and 4-nitrophenyl octanoate). We also showed them our presentation and some of their team members helped us with presentation advice and graphic design help for our figures.
