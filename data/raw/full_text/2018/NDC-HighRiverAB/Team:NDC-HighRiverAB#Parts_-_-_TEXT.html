Parts
This year our team created two new parts: a basic part and a composite part. Our basic part is EstA, our esterase gene. Our composite part drives expression of this part with a pLac promoter from the registry (Part:BBa_B0011) . We submitted our composite part to the registry and were able to characterize this part's functionality. In order to reach our goal of breaking down fats, which are a major component of buildups in wastewater systems, we selected the following biobrick parts for our plasmid with the goal of producing esterase:
- First, we researched an esterase-producing gene that could be expressed in E.coli. We decided to use the EstA gene, which is found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (BBa_K2694001)
- For our promoter, we decided to use pLAC, which is IPTG-inducible and is naturally found in E.coli. (Part:BBa_B0011)
- The RBS we used is B0034. (Part:BBa_B0034)
- Finally, we chose the double terminator B0015, which is the most common terminator and is known to be reliable. (Part:BBa_B0015)
- After we had chosen all of our biobrick parts, we combined them into the plasmid BBa_K2694000
