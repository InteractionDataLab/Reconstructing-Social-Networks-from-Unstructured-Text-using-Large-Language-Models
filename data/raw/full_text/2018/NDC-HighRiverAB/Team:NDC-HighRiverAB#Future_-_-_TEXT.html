Future Aspirations
Additional Testing
Our future goals are to do more testing with our bacteria, including introducing our bacteria to agar plates containing triglycerides and measuring for a pH change. Additional testing will allow us to better understand the effectiveness of the esterase produced by our bacteria.  Our team also looks forward to further researching what other classes of fats are found in fatbergs, and investigating how our project could be better suited to deal with them.
Further Collaboration with Waste Water Treatment Plants
The Town of High River Wastewater Treatment Facility has also generously invited us to use their lab and test our bacteria with the naturally occurring bacteria in their system so that we will have a better understanding of how the different types of bacteria interact. In this way, we have the potential to need and incorporate other enzymes in order to more effectively break down many substrates. In addition, we will be changing our promoter so that it will be suited more to the environment of the sewer system as opposed to the lab because our current promoter is simply used for testing purposes because it is easy to control.
In the future, our team will continue to discuss issues in Waste Water Treatment and the plausibility of our project with both our local treatment facility and Cargill. Cargill is a meat processing plant outside of High River, that is focussed on being both sustainable and environmentally friendly.
Further Collaboration with Amino Labs
Additionally, our team is in the feasibility study phase of collaborating with Amino Labs. Through the partnership, we will be turning our project into a household testing kit for triglycerides. Through this partnership, we hope to educate others about synthetic biology and the issue of fatty obstructions in wastewater treatment.
