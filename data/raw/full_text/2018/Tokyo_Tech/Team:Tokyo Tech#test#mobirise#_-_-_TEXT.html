Finding Flavi
Establishment of dengue virus serotype prediction and detection systems
LEARN MORE LIVE DEMO
Dengue virus, which is in the flavivirus family, is a worldwide spread virus and has huge
impact on society, however, not many developing countries are recognizing its danger.
Dengue virus is unique in terms of its four different serotypes. Multiple infection can easily
cause severe dengue, appearing hemorrhage and organ damage. It is important to grasp
which serotype the patient is infected, however, there is not enough data about each
serotype in a year.
To tackle the situation, we succeeded in the development of the serotype prediction system
using stochastic process analysis. This system can predict the patient’s serotype by
simulating the past data. We also developed the simple and fast testing kit that can detect
serotype with fluorescence, so that we can check the patient easily and get enough data to
estimate the patients’ serotypes more accurate. In the future, this system can contribute to
other flavivirus detection system.
