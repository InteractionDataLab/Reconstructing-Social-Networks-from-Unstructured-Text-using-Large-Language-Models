Integrated plactice of Finding Flavi
Meeting with Dr. Nukuzuma
 (City of Kobe, Environ. and Health Res. Lab., JPN)
As a virologist, Dr. Nukuzuma has done research on infectious virus for many years. Based on his experience, he taught us about all about flavivirus - genetic and phenotypic features, potential risks, obstacles that current clinical methods have. Those advices were so valuable for us to start thinking about the direction of our project design. After this meeting with Dr. Nukuzuma, we decided to work on serotype prediction of dengue virus.
We had a presentation about  project
We told Dr. Nukuzuma our Finding Flavi kit and

Discussion with Dr. Nishida 
(Post-doctoral researcher at Yamamura Lab., Tokyo Institute of Technology, JPN)
We started to search for the previous raw data on the number of dengue fever patients for each serotype, and found one dataset released from QSNICH (Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health), that shows relative sampling frequency of each DENV serotype over 30 years.
We showed this dataset to Dr. Nishida. He told us that this kind of infection data shows the regularity, and suggested us that we should use empirical differential modeling method to extract the pattern and predict the change in the near future.
As a result, we developed the model to predict relative sampling frequency of each DENV serotype. However, though we successfully applied the model for the data in Bangkok, due to the lack of similar detailed public data, we could not establish robust and versatile model for some other affected areas. 
Meeting with Dr. Suzuki 
(Department of Virology II, National Institute of Infectious Diseases)
We met Dr. Suzuki after establishing the prediction model. He has done research on flavivirus for many years and he gave us advice to solve the lack of public data. He introduced existing detection methods for dengue virus to us and also mentioned both advantages and disadvantages that those methods have.
He has developed a new detection method for the virus with luciferase and neutralization assay and explained us about the specific mechanism and protocol.
Meeting with Dr. Tagawa
Shape your future web project with sharp design and refine coded functions.
After meeting Dr. Suzuki, we brought back what he talked about to the lab and had discussion with our PI, Dr. Tagawa, based on the advice from Dr. Suzuki. Dr. Tagawa has a wide range of expertise on virology and cellular engineering. He suggested that we should modify a part of the new method that Dr. Suzuki has developed. After all, we decided to modify his method by substituting luciferase for fluorescence protein and designed a new detection method.
