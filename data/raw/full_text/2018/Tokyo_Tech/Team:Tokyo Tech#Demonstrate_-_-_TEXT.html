Biosafety
As you can see in Fig. 9, on native virus genome, structural genes and non-structural genes are integrated on the same sequence. Thus, the whole genome are replicated and that make viruses possible to replicate themselves in host cells. However, as you can see our construct design in Fig. 10, structural and non-structural regions are splitted so that the pseudo-virus cannot replicate themselves in host cells because RNA polymerase from non-structural V gene cannot replicate structural genes. To sum up, our system starts and ends in one place and doesn't harm environment.
