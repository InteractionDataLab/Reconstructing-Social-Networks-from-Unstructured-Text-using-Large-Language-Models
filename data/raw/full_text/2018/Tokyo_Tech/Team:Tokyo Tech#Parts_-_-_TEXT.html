Note: Validated Parts (Silver Medal Criteria)
DENV2 C, EGFP-FMDV2a and DsRed-Express-FMDV2a are essential for pseudo-virus production. As one of the structural genes, DENV2 C plays an important role in virus structural formation. EGFP-FMDV2a and DsRed-Express-FMDV2a are enclosed in pseudo-virus and programmed to code functional fluorescence proteins after infecting the host cells. To get specific sequence and charanterization information, please see the following Parts Pages.

Best Parts: EGFP-FMDV2a ( BBa_K2729006 )
Our team made new pseudovirus that can infect Vero cells and introduce the gene including this EGFP-FMDV2a. With the assistance of "self-cleaving" 2A peptides, EGFP is produced inside of the cell and folded so that it can emit fluorescence at the end.
Since EGFP is 35 times brighter than wild-type GFP and FMDV2a precisely works in our assumption, you can easily check the degree of infection by measuring fluorescence intensity.
Biosafety
As you can see in Fig. 1, on native virus genome, structural genes and non-structural genes are integrated on the same sequence. Thus, the whole genome are replicated and that make viruses possible to replicate themselves in host cells. However, as you can see our construct design in Fig. 2, structural and non-structural regions are splitted so that the pseudo-virus cannot replicate themselves in host cells because RNA polymerase from non-structural V gene cannot replicate structural genes. To sum up, our system starts and ends in one place and doesn't harm environment.
