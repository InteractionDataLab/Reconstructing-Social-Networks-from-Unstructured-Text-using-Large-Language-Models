Constraction
The pseudovirus production phase consists of the following parts: construction, transfection and collection of pseudoviruses.
After collecting pseudoviruses from HEK293T cells, we added them to Vero cells. When they can successfully infect the cells, the enclosed fluorescence protein gene is coded and we tried to estimate the amount by measuring the fluorescence intensity.
Since we split up the structural region and non-structural region, the pseudoviruses produced in our system can infect host cells only once. Thus, it will not spread out of the system and will not be harmful.
