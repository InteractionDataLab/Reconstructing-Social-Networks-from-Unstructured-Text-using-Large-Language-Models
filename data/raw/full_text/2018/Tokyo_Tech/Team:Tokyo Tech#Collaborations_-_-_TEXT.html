In this year we had a lot of collaborations
Japan-Taiwan Meetup and collaborative analysis on current detection methods
Collaboration Team: NYMU-Taipei
Their topic for this year is to create an easy, time-saving, and affordable screening model in order to determine the effectiveness of hair loss treatments.
Our project also involves detection techniques used by NYMU this year. While NYMU and us use the techniques to build quite different things, we have the common goal of eliminating the use of ELISA in the domain of interest for that ELISA is a detection technique too expensive to be widely applied.
Both of our teams have common in finding another countermeasure rather than using ELISA. We both wish the best for our projects’ successes in iGEM competition. But most of all, we hope our ideas have global impact and improve our lives in our future.

Hosting “iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018” at Tokyo Tech
Collaboration Team: ASIJ Tokyo , Gifu , Botchan Lab , and KAIT Japan
(Aug 8th, 2018)
Our team hosted “iGEM East Japan Meetup 2018” at Tokyo Tech on August 8th.
Japanese iGEM teams get together in Tokyo. Each team gave a presentation about their provisional project and their team management. After that, we exchanged opinions and give some advice to each other.
This meetup inspired all the teams and we look forward to seeing again and working together even after iGEM.

Consultation about protein purification methods in this year’s project
Collaboration Team: ASIJ Tokyo
Their topic for this year is combating a disease called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.
One of iGEM Tokyo Tech’s instructors, Dr. Hayashi and some members gave them specific instructions about protein purification methods with His-tag.
We believe our advice helped their project go further and feel excited to see their achievements in Jamboree.
