LECTURE IN HIGH SCHOOL
We visited Koshigaya Kita High School in Saitama Prefecture on September 15th and held an event.
There were two things that we wanted to tell in this event.
Previous Next Close
1. About dengue fever
In Japan, in 2014, dengue infected people occurred in Yoyogi Park in Tokyo, and it became a big topic. However, there are not many people who know more about their nature. As the climate of Japan are changing, it is said that the number of infected people in Japan will increase greatly. We aimed to have high school students acquire correct knowledge about dengue, which is the theme of this project.
We explained about dengue fever and played games to deepen understanding about mosquito-borneness. The students were divided to the mosquito team and the human team divide. In the game, the virus spreads like 
human → mosquito → another human being.
 
The students enjoyed very much and participated in the game!
 
 
2. About research at university
In the process of research, thinking into one problem with various approaches is very important. However, high school, subjects, such as biology, physics, chemistry, geography etc... are separated very clearly, and it is not easy to think with connecting them together. So, we explained that we are progressing the project from both sides of Wet and Dry.
We played games on the spread of infection, but we compared the results with computer simulation results. Although our research is synthetic [biology], I think that you have experienced how important the simulation plays.
 
The results of the questionnaire written by the students are as follows.
