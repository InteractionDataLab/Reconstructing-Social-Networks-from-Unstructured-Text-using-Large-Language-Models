BBa_K2619102
Packaging device (MS2)
MS2 can be fused with exosome-associated proteins CD63 to package mRNA with 3 loops during the formation of exosome.
BBa_K2619103
Booster
The tricistronic STEAP3-SDC4-NadB construct at a 1:1:1 ratio by which exosome secretion is supposed to enhanced by 15-fold to 40-fold in yield

BBa_K2619104
mRNA modification (nluc-C/D box-VEEV)
C/D box-VEEV can be added to 3'-UTR region of actively loading RNA to bind to RNA binding domain of packaging device with L7Ae and stablize mRNA. Nluc was added as reporter gene.

BBa_K2619105
mRNA modification  (nluc-3 loop-VEEV)
C/D box contains the structure of k-loop RNA motif which can be recognized by L7Ae. By engineering it at the 3'-UTR of cargo mRNA, CD63-L7Ae can load that RNA into exosome.
