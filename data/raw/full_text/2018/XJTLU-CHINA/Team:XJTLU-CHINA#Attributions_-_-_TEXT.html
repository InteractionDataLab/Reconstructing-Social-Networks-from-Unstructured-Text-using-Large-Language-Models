Sincere and special thanks to venerable back-ups
Primary PI
Dr. Guoxia Han gave us alerting suggestion on scientific research and made his best to ensure us go ahead bravely.                     He also spent effort in quality control for every work we did.                     He would also accompany us to the giant jamboree and take care of us in the U.S.
Dr. David Chiu first prepared extra classes to help us understand more about synthetic biology techniques and lab safety.                     He gave us constant advice and knowledge in project determination and data analyses. Moreover,                     lots of project logic lines and explanations were examined by him.
Secondary PI
Prof. Dechang Xu supported us by listening to all our concerns and encouraging us to find solutions.                     He also advised us on our modelling strategies and helped us to establish connections with many of our sponsors and collaborators both inside and outside school.
Instructor
Mr. Yunpeng Zhong offered additional training in gene syntheses for the junior members in winter.                     During project decisions, he provided an idea and came up a lot of advice regarding an iGEM project.                     Besides, he also sponsored oligos for gene synthesis.
University Technicians
Mr. Zhongkai Huang and Ms. Sijing Meng supervised us in the lab all along.                     They spent huge efforts in lab materials preparation which rid much inconvenience of us.
Professors From Other Departments
Dr. Jia Meng supported a fund for our project running.
External supports
Companies
1. Snapgene sponsored 10 software licenses
2. New England Biolabs Sponsored us NEBuider reagent and T4 DNA ligase for our constructions
3. Genequantum sponsored us with free oligonucleotides and some of sequencing work
4. Synbio Technologies offered discount prizes for gene syntheses, cloning and sequencing services
Scholars
1. Prof. Guangyin Xu, Vice director of Institute of Neuroscience at Soochow University; Executive director of The Chinese Neuroscience Society.
2. Dr. MingYan Wang, Director of Centre for Neuroscience jointly founded by Wang Wenli Charitable Foundation and XJTLU. She generously provided us with DAPI staining dye.
3. Dr. Jian Liu, Associate professor of Department of Biological Sciences, XJTLU. She conferred us N2a cell line for our experiment.

10. Dr. Tianma Yuan, from Department of Biological Sciences, XJTLU
Other Teams
NJU-China team supported us in exosome quantification by Pierce BCA Protein Assay and Nanoparticle Tracking Assay. Additionally they provided us 1ml Dil dye for our neuron targeting        experiment for free.
NAU-China team helped us in modeling at the early team developmental stage.
LZU team supported us a plasmid construct.
Jiangnan iGEM team help us in some art design of human practice webpage
