Our Model
Overview
This year, our mathematical models are composed of three parts:                     Functional exosome production system pharmacokinetic model and mRNA delivery simulation.
Pharmacokinetic model
Pharmacokinetic model:
This model help us understand the aptitude of functional exosome to enter into brain and how it wander in blood circulation.
Link
mRNA delivery simulation
mRNA delivery simulation:
This simulation is to test the availability of CX43 and how therapeutic mRNA express in neuron cell.
Link
Exosome biogenesis system
Exosome biogenesis system:
The ODE-applied system help us investigate the exosome production and protein interaction.
