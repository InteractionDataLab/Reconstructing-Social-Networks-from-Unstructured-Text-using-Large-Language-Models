Pharmacokinetic model
Assessment of RVG aptitude
Background
The blood brain barrier (BBB) is formed by¬†many components including endothelial cells of the capillary wall, astrocyte and pericytes. It is the largest interface between the blood and the central nervous system and is situated between the blood and the interstitial fluid. Our RVG construct is designed to steer exosome to cross the obstacle                     Delivering exosome through BBB is an extremely complex process.                     The affinity of RVG to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) is critical to clathrin and caveolae-mediated transcytosis,                     which is the main mechanism of guiding exosome through the barrier. To study the ability of our engineered exosomes to pass the BBB,                     we simplify the whole process into passing endothelial cells and study the aptitude of RVG¬†by modeling the binding properties to the receptor side of the endothelial cell membrane.
CX43, a family member of gap junction proteins,                     can only help us to deliver exosome if it is open and exchange fusion signal with neuron cell. Here,                     we present a model demonstrating a macroscopic situation in gap junctions,                     and thereby ensuring the functionality of CX43 as a cytosolic delivery helper.
Assumption
1. Interacting bonding rupture does not occur during cellular trafficking of endothelial cell, so transcytosis is successful once endocytosis happens
2. Influences of hyperaemia are neglected.
3. endosome can be considered as spheres.
4. Influences resulting from PH„ÄÅ enzyme and salt concentration in blood are neglected.
Process and Result
The binding of the ligands on the surface of exosomes to the receptors of endothelial cells of capillary wall is affected by the blood flow.                     Blood flow creates a shearing force at the vessel walls that strains the receptor-ligand bondings and therefore increases the chances of disrupting the interaction.                      The following equations are given to measure dislodging force, including drag force (Fd) in the direction of blood flow and a rotating force called the torque (T).                     The two major forces hinder our exosome  to be bound and thus transported through the endothelial cell.
Figure 1Ôºödrag force(Fd)
Figure 2ÔºöRotation force(T)
The whole forces caused by blood flow could be measured by Fdis = Fd + Tq/2 [11].
The dislodging force (Fdis) to different size of nanoparticle is then tested.
There have been studies showing that exosome with 60nm diameter is most suitable for passing the vivo BBB model [11].                     So Fdis of 10-14 could be used as the force acting on exosome.                     The probability of forming the interaction and breaking the interaction under shear flow can be given as:
Pbonds=Pform-Pbreak
Pbonds represents the steady bonds forming during ligand - receptor contact.                     We set 10 matching receptor-ligand pairs with a series of association constants for one exosome to test the binding status of 0.5s when it comes to exosome-endothelial contact.                     If RVG-carried exosome has higher affinity,                     in other words, transcytosis ability than non-RVG exosome, it should adhere to endothelial cell membrane with more steady interaction.
Figure: RVG-carried exosome has the better binding ability under different association constant.                     Extra steady bonds are always formed on engineered exosome,                     which increases the probability of successful transcytosis and theoretically proves the aptitude of RVG-carried exosomes to across BBB by receptor-mediated transcytosis.                     Furthermore, more blood-injected exosome will enter into brain than the rest of the body due to the brain-guiding efficiency of RVG.

Simulation of exosome in blood simulation
Background
Circulation of the blood is a vital function in human body.                     The main significance of blood circulation is to guarantee a proper metabolism of every cell in the body.                     The various tissues of the body get various nutrientsÔºå water and oxygen from the blood.                     Exosome is transported without exception.                     However, injecting the exosomes into the vein is an efficient but risky approach of delivering exosome to the brain.                     Excess exosomes in the blood or other parts of the body can be harmful.                     To ensure a proper delivery of exosome,                     a pharmacokinetic model is built to simulate the kinetics of exosome circulation in blood after injection.
Process
The formulation is connected with two pharmacokinetic ideas.                     Firstly, Exosome can be reversibly bounded with blood components, which repress them to enter into main parts of body.                     Also, Heart acts like a pump which determines the proportion and flow of blood to the body by blood circulation.                     After considering the two basic ideas above, the following formulas are produced.

Results
Figure: distribution of injected exosome
According to the figure, most of the injected exosomes are absorbed by brain and other tissues.                     Those who bind blood components finally go into other parts of body.                     Also, the sum of exosome (‚àëE) entering into other tissues is approaching the 10% of total injected exosome,                     which is far less than those entering into the brain (ExoB). This result shows the efficiency of our exosome design.                     Additionally, the remaining amount of exosome in the blood (DisExo and FixedExo) approach zero within 20 hours.
Evaluation
According to our model, RVG could be theoretically helpful to steer exosome on passing BBB.                     At the meantime,                     it Increases the proportion of exosomes entering the brain,                     which lower the risk of causing potential damage to the human body. However,                     the amount of safe dose of exosome injected into human for curing patient is still remain unknown.
