Functional exosome production system
Overview
In this system, we applied ODE（ordinary differential equation）- system to predict the production of the exosome and other target proteins.                 Also, the interactions among them are inclusive in the time-amount model.
Assumptions
1. Production of exosome is mainly associated with booster protein.
2. mRNA and proteins are limited by natural degradation.
3. Amount of proteins stored into exosome is proportional to the size of each exosome, so size of exosome can be ignored.
4. The packaging of protein to exosome and finishing of translation happen simultaneously because the interval is too short to take into account.

Figure1: state value of target proteins
In this figure, we can see the non-packaging proteins (NadB, nsMase, Steap3) are tend to overexpress,                 and packaging protein (CX36, CD63-L7AE, SCD4, CD63-L7AE-drug) reached a producing-consuming balance

Figure3: individual demonstration of packaging-protein
Figure4: diagram of Exosome production
Figure5：Two version of the functional exosome.
As shown in figure 4, with the help of the booster, our output of functional exosome is significantly increasing.                 In our design of ExoB1, we add the nsMase as one of our booster members,                 which genders the amount of exosome into a higher level according to our model results.
In figure5, CM2-loaded exosome which has a low level of toxicity produce relatively less amount of exosome compared to the CE-loaded exosome.                 That is because L7AE capture the drug-mRNA more efficiently.
