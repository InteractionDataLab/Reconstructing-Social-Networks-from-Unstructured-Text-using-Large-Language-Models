                    Synthetic biology involves many uncertainties and risks because it involves the editing of genetic material and information in living organisms.
                    De Vriend emphasized that there are three types of biosafety risks in synthetic biology:
                    One is the risk of negative impact on the environment.
                    Organisms created by synthetic biology may have unexpected side effects.
                    The second is the risk of contaminating natural gene pools,
                    and synthetic organisms may transfer their genes to natural organisms.
                    Third is the risk of escape, synthetic organisms m causing lasting damage to the environment d ecosystem.
                    In addition, synthetic biology breaks the boundaries between artificial and natural to a certain extent,
                    it is even possible to create artificial life,
                    whether it will have uncontrollable and sustained effects on natural balance and ecosystems, and even be maliciously exploited.
                    There is still controversial in China’s society, which may led to the ethical issues of synthetic biology.

                    However, biosafety, ethical issues,
                    and thinking behind living things have been neglected intentionally or unintentionally in science education.
                    In view of this, in designing our social participation and educational activities, follow the guidelines of the following principles:

                    (2) <STRONG>Environmentally friendly and sustainable</STRONG>.
                    We passed on the belief that the research and application of biology need to be consistent with the concept of sustainable development,

                    This lecture is mainly for young people in Suzhou, hoping to stimulate their enthusiasm for science and spreading the awareness synthetic biology.
                    Professor Wang Mu, the director of the Department of Biological Sciences at XJTLU,
                    gave a speech entitled &quot;The Miracle of Life.&quot; He also encourages children to study hard, play happily,
                    and be the explorer of a scientific mystery. Xiaohan Zhang, a student from the our team, also brought a lecture on biological science.

                    and the public's understanding of genetic engineering and synthetic biology is highly biased.
                    After the &quot;Wei Zexi incident&quot;,
                    many people doubt the effectiveness of biological treatment and dare not choose the method of biological treatment.
                    Many people do not have the ability to distinguish between reliable science and snake oil.

                    This year, we focused on a special group of people in rural China.
                    In the countryside, the hollowing out phenomenon is serious,
                    which means that their children and the next generation have migrated to cities,

                    we walked into a remote hamlet of Suzhou, delivered a lecture on modern biotechnique in daily life and health,

                    When designing educational activities, we not only followed the principles of sustainability,
                    responsibility and open science,
                    but also consider the equal participation and extensive coverage of students from different backgrounds in practice.
                    Due to differences in background, some students may have received a better STEM education,
                    and some students may not have stepped into the laboratory ever, let alone touched frontier science.
                    But we insist on a value: we believe that in the face of science, different people should be given equal opportunities.
                    Therefore, we have designed several different educational curriculum practices:
                    participants ranged from kindergarten kids (3 years old) to seniors (70 years old) from metropolis to remote villages,
                    from international schools to underdeveloped areas, to choose the best way to adjust in their understanding.

                    Traditional science lectures could be boring for some participants. We always believe that science is fun and can be learned in practice.
                    According to the learning pyramid theory,
                    learning and teaching each other in practice are several ways to effectively master knowledge.
                    This year, for the first time, we cooperated with Zibo Normal College,
                    based on the concept of project-based learning, and developed a six-day “High School Student Science Experiment Summer Camp”.
                    About 50 young people aged 15-17 participated in it. This summer camp contained different disciplines of STEM,
                    provided opportunities for students from different backgrounds to do experiments by themselves and to develop an interest in science.
                    We also led them to discuss the philosophical and ethical issues of science and technology.
                    At the same time,
                    a specialist from institute of Leadership and Educational Development (iLEAD) in XJTLU also shared many constructive opinions based on a cognitive theory for our curriculum design.

                    We also developed a series of street science popularization activities for the public.
                    For example, in order to enable more people to hear our voices,
                    we have successfully established a partnership with TED x SUZHOU this year,

                    Researchers should actively engage with their communities, stakeholders, listen to their voices,

                    In this year's human practice,
                    we have used all resources and channels to reach long-term strategic partnerships with many organizations.
                    We are endorsed by the Suzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the first time and successfully carried out health education activities.
                    We have reached a long-term cooperation intention with the Suzhou Youth Science and Technology Museum for scientific popularization activities,
                    and indirectly contributed to the Cooperation between public institutions and our university.
                    This year is also our first attempt to participate in a series of online and offline events at TEDxSuzhou.
                    In the near future, we will be invited as a guest speaker at TEDxSuzhou Youth to share our stories with more people. Further,
                    for the first time, we discussed with the University’s Research Management Office,
                    law firms and external companies the possibility of intellectual property protection and the conversion of the results into patents.
                    The companies we cooperate with this year have also grown substantially and the cooperation has been further deepened.
                    In addition, we have established good relationships with various departments of the university.
