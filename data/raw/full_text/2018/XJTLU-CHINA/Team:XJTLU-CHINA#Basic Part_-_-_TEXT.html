BBa_K2619000
STEAP3
A metalloreductase can enhance exosome biogenesis through Endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-independent or non-classical pathway.
Shiyu Liu
1479bp
BBa_K2619001
SDC4
Syndecan-4 was used to support budding of endosomal membranes through syndecan-4/syntenin (ESCRT-dependent classical) pathway.
Shiyu Liu
609bp
BBa_K2619002
NadB
A gene encodes L-aspartate oxidase which possibly boosts cellular metabolism by tuning up the citric acid cycle. We used it to accelerate exosome biogenesis.
Shiyu Liu
1008bp
BBa_K2619003
CD63
a transmembrane protein which densely distributes on exosomal membrane. We used the transmembrane domain of CD63 in our design.
Haoping Cheng
714bp
BBa_K2619004
nluc
A newly developed luciferase which was expressed as an indicator of exosome quantity by combining to CD63.
Shiyu Liu
510bp
BBa_K2619005
C/D box
C/D box contains the structure of k-loop RNA motif which can be recognized by L7Ae. By engineering it at the 3'-UTR of cargo mRNA, CD63-L7Ae can load that RNA into exosome.
Peng Chai
72bp
BBa_K2619006
3 loop
3 loop are the stem loops cognate with MS2, which can be recognized by MS2. By engineering it at the 3'-UTR of cargo mRNA, CD63-MS2 can load that mRNA into exosome
Shiyu Liu
89bp
BBa_K2619007
Connexin36
Connexin 36(gap junction protein, Homo sapiens) is a gap junction protein which can form a transmemberane channel to release cargo mRNA. It is expressed predominantly in inferior olive and hippocampus.
Haohui Fang
966bp
BBa_K2619008
Connexin43
Connexin 43 (gap junction protein alpha 1, Homo sapiens) is a gap junction protein designed to increase the efficiency of releasing mRNA into target cell. It is expressed predominantly in glial cells.
Peng Chai
1146bp
BBa_K2619009
GNSTM
An attachment site which  prevents targeting peptide RVG from degradation without effecting the interaction at targeted cells.  We utilized it to increase the targeting drug-delivery efficiency of exosomes.
Haoping Cheng
15bp
BBa_K2619010
VEEV RSS
VEEV RSS is a  stabilizing sequence from the 3′UTR of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV),which can stabilize mRNA for up to 36 hours.
Shiyu Liu
392bp
BBa_K2619011
HSP70
A chaperone that facilitates the degradation progress of Lewy body and Lewy neurites, which is a characteristic symptom of Parkinson’s disease. Its mRNA was loaded in exosomes as therapeutic RNA.
