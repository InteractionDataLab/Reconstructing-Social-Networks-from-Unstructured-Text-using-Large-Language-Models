InterLab Introduction
What is InterLab?
Reliability and repeatability are always prior to the principle of bioscience.                     Once the experimental results can be repeated and valued by different researchers,                     the conclusion drew from the experiments can somewhat be true. As a new branch of biological research,                     synthetic biology, has met some challenges at reliability and repeatability which would prevent its further development.                     One of the main points is that researchers use different units and methods which might cause the inconvenience when sharing data between different laboratories.                     Hence, iGEM community,                     the pioneer in synthetic biology fields, hold the InterLab study in order to normalize the variability in the synthetic biology field.
Our team has attached great concern to this InterLab study and assigned special team members to conduct rigorous experiments and analysis in order to complete the following goals set by the organizing committee.
Can we reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD?
Our InterLab study was conducted according to the two protocols provided by iGEM headquarters.

Conclusions
In summary, our InterLab study has successfully completed the experimental objectives set by the organizing committee.                     The data from our InterLab study can be used to normalize the deviation caused by unit inconsistency among different laboratories.
