Cake and science
Wondering about how we could bring our project in mind of people from our city who we wouldn’t meet at the university, we came up with a rather unusual idea: Why not have a piece of cake with people while introducing them to our project?  We organized two cake sales at the facilities of the university hospital in Wuerzburg. We were able to present our project to the public and we also gained some revenue selling the cakes.
People were attracted by our poster we had brought with us. Not only doctors were curious, but also the staff, visitors and the patients were asking questions about our work. Enlightening conversations about the development of diagnostic tests while eating a lovely piece of self-made cake created a less common, more extraordinary atmosphere, which was pleasant for our visitors and for ourselves. For the insatiable curious people, we provided handouts for further reading.
Lab intern pipetting test
The iGEM intern pipetting workshop was designed to provide first semester students an introduction to standard pipetting techniques. Also, the more experienced students were given an excellent opportunity to pass on their knowledge to younger students.
Taking part in the lab intern pipetting test also trained the participants in precise pipetting, which was a big advantage for the students of the wet lab team when they started their work in the lab later.
Protocol Bradfort protein assay
Bradford solution
Dilute Bradford solution 1:5 with water.                 Use for one 96 well plate 12 ml water and 3 ml Bradford solution.
BSA solution
Dilute BSA solution 1:20 with water.                 Use 11µl BSA and 209 µl water for one 96 well plate.
Assay
Transfer 100µl Bradford solution and 2µl BSA solution in each well.                 Mix the solution well and destroy all airbubbles with a pipette tip.
Measurement
Measure absorption of the 96 well plate with a photometer at 580nm.
To pass the pipetting test the error rate of two following rows in a 96 microwell plate had to be less than 6 %.                 If a student met this criterium, we decided by this calculation:
1. average for one row
2. deviation average – a single well plate (for every well plate in a row)
3. result of 2. / average for one row * 100
