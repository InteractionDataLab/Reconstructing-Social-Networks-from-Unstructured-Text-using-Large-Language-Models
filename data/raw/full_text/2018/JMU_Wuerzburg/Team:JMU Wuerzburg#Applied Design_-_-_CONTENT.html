                Malaria is an infectious disease spread worldwide that causes an estimated 
                number of 400.000 deaths per year according to the World Malaria Report 2017. 
                Mostly young children in Sub-Saharan Africa are affected that severely.  
                It is caused by certain protozoan parasites of the genus<I> Plasmodium</I> whose 
                primary hosts are <I>Anopheles</I> mosquitos. Through bites of these mosquitos, 
                Malaria is transmitted to humans and other animals. 200 million new cases of 
                malaria are reported every year by the WHO. The number of incidences is declining, 
                but still despite the enormous expenses, a global agenda to control and eradicate 
                malaria remains unfinished. <SUP><A href="#design_refs">1</A></SUP>
                In humans, malaria is caused by five parasite species which all belong 
                to the genus<I> Plasmodium</I>: <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>, <I>Plasmodium vivax</I>, 
                <I>Plasmodium malariae</I>, <I>Plasmodium ovale</I> and <I>Plasmodium knowlesi</I>. 
                The most common are <I>Plasmodium vivax</I> and <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>,
                which are responsible for the most severe cases of malaria.  
                
                There are several problems that complicate the mission to control 
                Malaria. The ability of the pathogen to develop resistance to medical
                treatment is just one example. Due to these resistances the need of 
                new drugs and clinical approaches is as urgent as never. <SUP><A href="#design_refs">2</A></SUP>
                The most common method in malaria diagnostics is 
                based on the microscopic examination of blood smears. 
                The result is largely dependent on the skill of the person 
                examining the blood and on the present levels of parasite. 
                Although antigen- and PCR-based tests exist, they are often 
                too expensive or not manageable due to the lack of appropriate equipment.
                Also, in respect of the rising resistances, a highly reliable, cheap and easily
                usable diagnostic method is needed to prescribe the right drug and to avoid incorrect,
                since delivering the correct diagnosis as soon as possible after infection is essential
                for a successful trial. <SUP><A href="#design_refs">3</A></SUP></DIV><H3>Motivation – improving diagnosis</H3><DIV>
                We want to contribute to the improvement of Malaria diagnosis. 
                Rapid and correct diagnosis would save valuable time for an appropriate 
                medical treatment. A new diagnostic tool that enables correct, rapid and specific
                detection of plasmodium in the human blood could compensate for deficits of 
                the current detection methods. In doing so we address the most urgent problems 
                that tend to prevent a large-scale application of diagnostic test systems 
                in countries with a poorly developed health care system. In fact, 
                <I>P. falciparum </I> is responsible for most of the severe cases of Malaria
                with the highest mortality.<SUP><A href="#design_refs">4</A></SUP> A test system to distinguish between P. 
                falciparum and other species could quickly provide useful information to 
                select the correct drug for a more targeted therapy. We hope that our effort
                helps to progress towards a world with less people suffering from Malaria.
            </DIV><H3>Design</H3><DIV><H4>Benefits</H4><DIV>
                    We propose a design of a detection system that is easy 
                    to use without any medical training and does not require 
                    expensive technical equipment. It is not dependent on a reliable 
                    power supply. Consequently, the application of the test system is 
                    not restricted to medical facilities. It enables diagnostic testing 
                    directly at the bedside of the patient with suspected Malaria. 
                    The detection system indicates if a patient is suffering from Malaria. 
                    Since <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> is responsible for the most severe cases 
                    of malaria, but not the only<I> Plasmodium</I> species causing human malaria, 
                    our diagnostic tool specifically detects the DNA of these species.
                </DIV><H4>Testing procedure and Hardware</H4><DIV>
                    Our test system relies on the detection of DNA of the parasite<I> Plasmodium</I>. 
                    Many of the erythrocytes of an infected patient are filled with thousands 
                    of copies of the parasite’s genome. At first, a blood sample 
                    from a patient with suspected malaria is taken.

                    
                    The next steps are performed in a simple test tube with separated chambers
                    to isolate different reactions. Through lysis of the blood 
                    cells the DNA is extracted. Afterwards the parasites DNA is
                    purified and prepared for amplification. The isolated DNA is
                    then amplified and detected by  multiplex qPCR.



                    For the amplification of characteristic parts of the<I> Plasmodium</I> genome 
                    we developed two pairs of primers. One of these indicates if a patient 
                    is affected by<I> Plasmodium</I> in general. The other one specifically detects 
                    the species <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I>. We use our BioBrick which contains a part 
                    of synthetic template for a conserved sequence in the genome of all 
                    human-pathogenic plasmodium species as a positive control to establish our qPCR.
                </DIV></DIV><H3>Outlook</H3><DIV>
                
                To avoid the need of expensive thermocyclers, 
                the amplification could be conducted isothermally by using RPA 
                (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification), 
                which is capable of amplifying very low initial concentrations of 
                DNA in around 20 minutes.<SUP><A href="#design_refs">5</A></SUP> 
                The amplified DNA product could later be detected in a 
                lateral flow assay like is has been performed by Kersting et al. in 2014<SUP><A href="#design_refs">6</A></SUP>.
                The presence of <I>Plasmodium</I> DNA and specifically <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> DNA is indicated through a visible color signal.
            </DIV><H3>Proof of concept</H3><DIV>
                We tested the primers by means of synthetic DNA oligos, 
                genomic sequences in plasmids (our BioBrick) and genomic DNA 
                of <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> in a qPCR setting. Multiplexing was also achieved.
