Test Tonic â€“ a rapid test system for the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium
Malaria is a widely spread infectious disease that causes                  400.000 deaths every year and affects more than 200 million                  people in total according to the WHO's Worlds Malaria Report 2017.                  The disease is caused by different species of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium.                  For a successful therapy of Malaria, a fast and sensitive                  detection of the species affecting the patient is crucial. 1
Our aim is to construct a test system that is capable of                  detecting the DNA of Plasmodium.                  We venture to create a rapid, easily usable and cheap diagnostic                  device for large area application. To reach this goal,                 we design primers and probes by analysing published sequences                 of the human pathogenic Plasmodium species with bioinformatic tools.                 We reach out to create one primer-probe pair that can detect Plasmodium in general and a specific primer/probe pair for P. falciparum.
For the amplification of characteristic parts of the Plasmodium genome we developed two pairs of primers for each species.                  One of these indicates if a patient is affected of Plasmodium in general.                  The other one specifically detects the species Plasmodium falciparum.
After identification of fitting sequences,                  we evaluate and optimize our primers by running qPCR assays with                  E. coli containing our BioBrick: a plasmid with a short,                  synthetic, non-pathogenic sequence of the Plasmodium genome                  as a positive control. Additionally we conduct qPCR assays                  with genomic DNA of cultured Plasmodium parasites.
To perform the amplification directions in a user-friendly                  way we designed a hardware model. The reactions steps are conducted                 in a simple test tube with separated chambers to isolate different reactions.                  A step motor and an Arduino manage the movement and mixing of the reaction fluids.
After creating a fundamental model with a multiplex qPCR we elaborate                  a way to apply our detection system to Recombinase Polymerase Amplification                  (RPA) 2 , 3 . RPA is a promising alternative for qPCR                  to isothermally amplify our target sequences in a short period of time.                  It has been shown to be a sufficient method to detect                  Plasmodium DNA by Kersting et al. in 2014 4 .                  RPA makes such a test system cheap and avoids the                  need of an expensive thermocycler. This results in many advantages                  for the application in travelling situations and in areas without                 proper infrastructure and energy supply.
