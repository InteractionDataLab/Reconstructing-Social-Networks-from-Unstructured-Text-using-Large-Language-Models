Collaborations
USP-EEL Brazil iGEM Team
In the frames of collaboration with USP-EEL-Brazil iGEM Team , we created a homology model for their expressed protein laccase, which functions to degrade water contaminating estrogens. We found that the homologous protein from the organism Myceliophthora thermophila has a higher affinity binding to 17A-ethinylestradiol than to estrone. Using the protein-ligand docking software, we hypothesized the explanations for the phenomenon in the hydrogen bond in the structure of laccase enzyme, which facilitates the redox reaction in the active site for 17A-ethinylestradiol better than for estrone. Thus, the model showed the affinity of the homologous to laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus protein to two similar ligands and it explained the reasons of difference between the interactions.
Duesseldorf iGEM Team
The collaboration with Duesseldorf iGEM Team has also given us interesting perspectives on our project and the transformation protocols of Synechococcus elongatus. Both of our teams worked with the cyanobacterial organisms, so through the Skype meeting we presented the ideas of our projects and could exchange valuable troubleshooting ideas. The team of Duesseldorf agreed to look at our protocol of transformation and suggested antibiotic gradient plates, which we consequently tried to use. They have also given us a piece of advice on the sponsorship attraction.
Stony Brook iGEM team
Stony Brook iGEM Team was one of the teams, who worked with the same strain of cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Collaboration with this team was very helpful for our team since the team shared their protocol of transforming cyanobacteria. At that moment, we troubleshooted the transformation protocol, media plate preparation protocols and antibiotic resistance for obtaining separate single colonies of transformed Synechococcus elongatus. The protocol of Stony Brook Team appeared to be successful and gave us first separate colonies which we could further use for the hydrogen sulfide assay. We, in turn, suggested some solutions for the adjustment of proper temperature for cyanobacteria in their CO2 incubator.
Tart_TUIT Estonia iGEM Team
We started our collaboration with Tart_TUIT iGEM Team from an Interlab study during which we tried to help each other to verify the final results. Later, our collaboration expanded to the discussion of our projects through the Skype meeting, where we could share ideas about different aspects of the competition and suggest some improvements on the current issues.
San Diego high school team
We have arranged a Skype meeting with a CCA-San Diego high school team , during which we shortly presented our projects. Since both our of our projects were related to bioremediation of oil products and production of hydrogen gas, we suggested them possible methods for hydrogen gas detection and quantification. This team has truly cheered us up with their enthusiasm and the collaboration went mutually productive.
Thessaloniki iGEM Team
The collaboration included answering a survey about synthetic biology, laboratory work, safety and ethics that was addressed to experienced scientists working on the synthetic biology field .
