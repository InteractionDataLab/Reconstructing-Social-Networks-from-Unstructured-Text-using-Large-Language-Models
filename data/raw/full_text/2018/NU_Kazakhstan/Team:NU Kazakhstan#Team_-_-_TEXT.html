About us
iGEM NU team is a team of undergraduate students desperate to make this world a better place. Being the only team coming from Kazakhstan and Central Asia, we feel very honored to be representing our university and country in an international scientific competition. It is our fourth time participating in the iGEM competition and we are looking forward to sharing our ideas with the rest of the world.
SUPERVISORS
Abdulla Mahboob
Primary PI,  Assistant Professor, Chemistry Department, School of Science and Technology, Nazarbayev University.
Laurent Richard
Secondary PI, Associate Professor, School of Mining and Geosciences, Nazarbayev University.
Kuanysh Sarkytbayev
is the youngest and the most ambitious member of our club. He is positive and full of ideas. Whenever we start discussing and brainstorming, no one can make him stop talking, which surely has its pros and cons.
Atabek Bektash
is a very hard-working, but rather grumpy member of our team. He is sarcastic 24/7 and he is mostly in charge of making lame jokes. But besides that, without any doubt, he plays a vital role in achieving the results for our wet labs.
Tomiris Mulikova
is an accurate and tidy person. She will do everything in order to achieve her goal. Her hobby is yoga, despite the fact that she attended yoga classes only twice.
Ayagoz Meirkhanova
is objective and realistic. She is composed of 50% of coffee and 50% of pure sarcasm. Never show her videos of orphaned animals - she will start crying immediately.
Aiganym Abduraimova
is a dreamy and cheerful person. She is a purposeful and versatile individual. An indicator of a good mood - sings Korean songs even if she does not speak Korean.
Alyamdar Askerov
is one of the smartest members of our team. He plays an important role in the lab - washing dishes and taking out the garbage. He’s our informal TA with the king size lab coat.
Malika Khassenova
is the positive and peaceful member. She is very calm in practically any situation and does everything very thoroughly, always finishing her job no matter what. She is generally a hard-working person but she can still give a wise piece of advice outside of the lab.
Assel Mukhanova
got the best of both worlds. She is pretty and at the same time hard-working. If she hears a song, she will be humming that song for weeks. Even though it can get annoying sometimes, we secretly enjoy it.
Aigerim Abdimanova
is a dedicated and smart girl. She is a good presenter and has valuable communication skills. She is always positive and she is responsible for the warm atmosphere and good mood in the laboratory, even after 12 hours of work (until Atabek says something rude to her, of course)
Aidana Toleshova
is a hyperactive girl who can do almost everything. She is involved in every process of achieving the best results for the competition. Sometimes she is so strong and unfazed that it seems like she has the Atabek resistance gene.
Daulet Aitymbayev
is our team leader and gene design guru. Everything sounds easy for him. The overall project would not be real without him. If Loki says: “I have an army”, we can respond: “We have Daulet”.
Ramina Abdymananova
is a cutie pie of our team. She is a very trustworthy and straight-forward member of our team, which makes this life so much easier.
Nurgul  Makhmetova
is a very positive, responsible and understanding person. Even when she is busy she is ready to help, that you wish she lived down the street.
Nikhola Mirashirova
is a calm and patient person. On top of that, she is superwoman, she was doing PCR reactions and working at the lab while preparing for the MCAT.
Lyazzat Bekish
is definitely a hard-working “bee” of our team. She is a guru in basically everything, so if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask her for help.
