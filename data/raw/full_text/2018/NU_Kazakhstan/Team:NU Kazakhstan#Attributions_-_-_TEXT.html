General Support
We are infinitely grateful for all support given by our Supervisor, PI, Instructor, Assistant Professor of Chemical Department at Nazarbayev University Abdulla Azzam Mahboob for the long hours he spent supervising us in the lab and his priceless contribution throughout the project.
Special thanks to all faculty members of the Biology and Chemistry Department of School of Science and Technology at Nazarbayev University for their great support, advice and working space provided during the project conduction
Project support and advice
Abdulla Azzam Mahboob, Assistant Professor, Chemistry Department, School of Science and Technology, Nazarbayev University. Supervised the project progress and protocols design. Assisted in designing and modeling of constructs. Gave the general guidance on the best practice in the lab and ensured the safety of the experiments performed. Supported us at every step of iGEM, was ready to listen to all our concerns and issues during project conduction, and helping us to find coherent solutions, staying late nights with us. Ordering reagents and solving every single problem we created. Assisted in getting S. elongatus PCC 7942 strain and reagents. Laurent Richard, Associate Professor, School of Mining and Geosciences, Nazarbayev University - made cryogel for our cyanobacteria.
