7. Wrap the microcentrifuge tube in aluminum foil to protect from light and incubate at 30°C for 24 hours.
8. Plate the entire volume (0.3mL) of cells on the big plates containing antibiotics by streaking.
TRANSFORMATIONS OF CYANOBACTERIA (INVITROGEN)
1. Measure the optical density of the Synechococcus elongatus cultures (from step 10, page 13) at 750 nm (i.e., OD750). Note: For best performance, the OD750 of cultures should be greater than 1 and less than 2.

7. Add 100 ng of supercoiled plasmid DNA (i.e., a pSyn_6 construct containing your gene of interest) into the resuspended cells. In a separate tube, add 100 ng of an empty pSyn_6 vector as a negative control.
8. Mix the DNA-cell suspension gently by flicking the tube.
9. Incubate the cell-DNA mixtures in the 34°C water bath with a dark lid for 4 hours. After the incubation is complete, remove the tubes from the water bath and wipe them with 70% ethanol.
10. Plate 80 μL and 5 μL of each transformation mixture on separate BG-11 agar plates containing 10 μg/mL of spectinomycin and pre-warmed to room temperature.
11. Place the plates with agar side down on illuminated shelves at room temperature (25–30°C). Do not stack the plates to ensure continuous and even illumination.
12. Incubate the plates for 5–7 days or until the colonies are ready to pick. The results from the transformation with the pSyn_6 construct will depend on the nature of your gene of interest.

CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATION
was carried out according to IGEM Protocols
1. Resuspend DNA in selected wells in the Distribution Kit with 10µl dH20. Pipet up and down several times, let sit for a few minutes. Resuspension will be red due to the cresol red dye.
2. Label 1.5ml tubes with a part name or well location. Fill lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5ml tubes (one tube for each transformation, including your control) in a floating foam tube rack.
3. Pipette 50µl of competent cells into the 1.5ml tube: 50µl in a 1.5ml tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and be in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5ml tube for your control.
4. Pipette 1µl of resuspended DNA into the 1.5ml tube: Pipette from well into the appropriately labeled tube. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
5. Pipette 1µl of control DNA into the 2ml tube: Pipette 1µl of 10pg/µl control into your control transformation. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
6. Close 1.5ml tubes, incubate on ice for 30 min: Tubes may be gently agitated/flicked to mix solution but return to ice immediately.
7. Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 45 sec: 1.5ml tubes should be in a floating foam tube rack. Place in a water bath to ensure the bottoms of the tubes are submerged. Timing is critical.
8. Incubate on ice for 5 min: Return transformation tubes to an ice bucket.
9. Pipette 950µl SOC media to each transformation: SOC should be stored at 4°C, but can be warmed to room temperature before use. Check for contamination.
10. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour, shaking at 200-300 rpm.
11. Pipette 100µL of each transformation onto Petri plates Spread with a sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
12. Spin down cells at 6800g for 3 mins and discard 800µL of the supernatant.
13. Resuspend the cells in the remaining 100µL, and pipette each transformation onto Petri plates
14. Spread with a sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This increases the chance of getting colonies from lower concentration DNA samples.
15. Incubate transformations overnight (14-18 hr) at 37°C: Incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). If incubated for too long, colonies may overgrow and the antibiotics may start to break down; un-transformed cells will begin to grow.
