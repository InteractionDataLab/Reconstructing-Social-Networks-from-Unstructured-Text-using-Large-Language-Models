Sulfur-doped graphene as a catalyst in fuel cells
It is well known that working principle of fuel cells is much more efficient than that of batteries. However, it is still great challenge to design inexpensive fuel cells of good quality due to many complexities present. One of them is the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction on the cathode due to the limitations of platinum as the catalyst, such as numerous defect sites, lattice boundaries and low number of active sites on the surface.
Nowadays the application of nanomaterials in many industrial processes helps to find efficient solutions for the existing problems. Usage of the sulfur-doped graphene as a support for the growth of platinum catalyst is not an exception. Graphene has many outstanding electrochemical properties for this application due to its two-dimensional sp 2 hybridized carbon network. Many research papers proved that integrating the sulfur atoms to this system can significantly improve the catalytic properties of platinum.
Sulfur-doped graphene nanomaterials can be synthesized using the samples of transformed cyanobacteria that we have. This can be done through the following procedure…
Things to add after:
1. Procedure for preparing nanomaterials
2. Photos of samples
3. Results
4. Some clarifications of theory discussed with Dr. Mahboob
