Quick summary of our receptors
In our GJ presentation (10/25 Room 311 9:00-9:25), we used the image above to demonstrate the evolution of synthetic Notch receptors and our ENABLE toolbox present in 2018 iGEM GJ.
In our GJ presentation (10/25 Room 311 9:00-9:25), we used the image above to introduce our assay for measuring the signal-to-noise ratio of SynNotch. Please note that all cells expressing the receptors having mCherry expressed at the same time/level via P2A.
In our GJ presentation (10/25 Room 311 9:00-9:25), we used the image above to summarize our picks of SynNotch receptors with different extracellular domains and intracellular domains.
Transmembrane signal transduction systems
In order to be able to implement a customable multiplexed transmembrane signal input and                             output relationship, the first thing to do is to engineer modular receptors to enable it                             to recognize extracellular signals and transduce them into customized intracellular signals.                             To this end, a variety of techniques have been developed, such as Tango (Barnea et al., 2008) ,                             CAR (Porter et al., 2011), GEMS (Scheller et al., 2018), MESA (Daringer et al., 2014; Hartfield et al., 2017; Schwarz et al., 2017), SynNotch (Morsut et al., 2016; Roybal et al., 2016a; Roybal et al., 2016b; Toda et al., 2018) , etc.                             High modularity of the extracellular and intracellular domains of synthetic Notch (SynNotch),                             as well as its orthogonality and adaptation to contact-dependent signaling, fully meets our needs.                             Thus, we ultimately use SynNotch technology as receiver for extracellular signals to build our                             transmembrane logic gates.
Notch receptors are single-pass transmembrane receptors that transduce extracellular surface                             signals from sender cells to the inside of receiver cells. It features structural modularity and                             orthogonality in intracellular signal transduction. The signal strength and intensity of wild-type                             Notch receptors plays a crucial role in cell-fate decisions such as proliferation in development                             as well as homeostasis. This is true for functional outcomes that mainly rely on the dosage of                             the gene regulation and context of Notch signaling (Aster et al., 2008; Bray, 2016) For SynNotch,                             specialized factors will exclusively participate in regulation of genetic circuits that allow                             novel user-defined transcriptional responses. In our project ENABLE, we have engineered the cells                             to perform logical operations on multiple transmembrane signals to produce a variety of                             customizable outputs.
Figure 1. SynNotch activation.
SynNotch has customizable extracellular and intracellular domains, as well as a core regulatory region.         After the extracellular domain of the single-chain antibody recognizes the corresponding surface antigen,         the core regulatory region undergoes two cleavage (S2, S3 sites) to finally release the intracellular         segment of the transcription factor into the nucleus to activate the downstream circuits.
What is different in signal input?
1. Ligands
The largest family of ligands that can activate wild type Notch receptors features three                             related structural motifs, which are DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2) motif, EGF-like repeats,                             and DOS (Delta and OSM-11-like proteins) domain that are tandem EGF repeats (Kopan et al., 2009) .                             Wild type Notch receptors features cis-inhibition and trans-activation due to the antiparallel                             orientation of extracellular domains.
Similar to Notch receptors, the cis-inhibition mechanism was recapitulated in SynNotch receptors (Morsut et al., 2016) .                             This indicates that the activating and inhibiting mechanism of wild type Notch and SynNotch                             are probably alike in nature. Therefore, as long as the Notch core can be activated, any                             ectodomain could work. In 2015, Gordon and her colleagues demonstrated that Notch with FBP                             as ectodomain targeting FKBP in the presence of chemical rapamycin can activate Notch receptors (Gordon et al., 2015) .                             Lim and his colleagues have showed that SynNotch could recognize antigens such as CD19 and EGFP (Morsut et al., 2016; Roybal et al., 2016a) .
2. The ectodomain of Notch receptors
Previous work by Morsut et al. showed that the natural surface antigen CD19 and the non-natural                             surface antigen EGFP have good orthogonality (Toda et al., 2018) .                             We applied this and designed two surface antigens, surCD19 and surEGFP. By immunostaining,                             we were able to clearly detect surCD19 and surEGFP expressed on the surface of 293T cells (Figure 2a).                             Thus, these two surface antigens can serve as ideal dual antigens for our transmembrane binary                             Boolean logic inputs.
We selected αCD19 (anti-CD19) (Morsut et al., 2016) ,                             LaG17 (anti-EGFP with low affinity), LaG16-2 (anti-EGFP with high affinity) (Fridy et al., 2014)                             as the extracellular domain of SynNotch. Mouse Notch1 core (mN1c) regulatory region as the core                             transmembrane region of SynNotch. Two transcription factors, tTAA (TetR-VP48) and GV2 (Gal4DBD-VP64),                             which are orthogonal to each other, are used as the intracellular domain of SynNotch (Figure 2a).                             We found that the combination of different extracellular domains and intracellular domains has                             differentiated activation characteristics (Figure 2c) in transient transfection experiments.                             In all combinations, αCD19-mN1c-GV2 was not able to be activated efficiently (Figure 2c).                             LaG16-2-mN1c-GV2 and αCD19-mN1c-tTAA have high activation and low background expression.                             LaG16-2 was able to be efficiently activated only when activated with surEGFP but not surCD19 (Figure 2d). The excellent orthogonality between LaG16-2 and αCD19 ensures that we will                             not undergo signal crosstalk when using dual surface antigens as signal inputs in the future.                             In the following experiments, we used the LaG16-2-mN1c-GV2 and αCD19-mN1c-tTAA which has                             good performance, as actual transmembrane signal transduction elements. We used mCherry-tagged                             LaG16-2-mN1c-GV2 and EGFP-tagged αCD19-mN1c-tTAA to construct a stable cell line                             co-expressing dual-SynNotch receptors for subsequent experiments.
Meanwhile, as we mentioned above, some types of SynNotch have high background expression.                             This phenomenon aroused our great interests. We designed a systematic experiment to study the                             mechanism of SynNotch activation and hope to optimize it. We specifically covered the details                             of this section in the Optimization page .

Red shows a clear contour line. Lower left, surCD19         schematic. The extracellular region of surCD19 with HA tag was stained with anti-HA labeled with AF488.         Scale bar, 5 μm.
b. Schematic diagram of our SynNotch testing setting. Different extracellular scFvs and different intracellular         transcription factors were used as extracellular or intracellular domains of SynNotch.
c. SynNotch with different extracellular domain and intracellular domains has different activation strength.         SynNotch expressing cells (receiver cells) were stimulated with excessive surface antigen (surAg) expressing sender cells or Mock cells         carrying no surAg. The percentage of cells expressing d2EGFP (EGFP++%) was quantified by flow cytometry after         24 hours of co-culture of sender and receiver cells.
d. LaG16-2 and αCD19 were able to recognize surEGFP and surCD19 orthogonally. LaG16-2-mN1c-tTAA or αCD19-mN1c-tTAA was activated by surEGFP or surCD19, respectively, and TRE3GV-d2EGFP was used as the         downstream reporter. The median fluorence intensity of receiver cells were color coded on the right.
The error bar indicates SD of biological replicates, n=3.
The ectodomain of wild type Notch is composed of 29-36 modular epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like                             repeats, each around 40 residues in length and can be categorized into calcium binders and                             non-binders. Though former studies have assumed the shape of this ectodomain to be a long                             rod-like structure, taking a linear topology (Kopan and Ilagna,2009) ,                             recent studies have elucidated that there are multiple rods joined by flexible joints (Weisshuhn et al., 2015a, Weisshuhn et al., 2015b) .
Signal transduction of the Notch core
The signal transduction mechanism of Notch signaling is very unique. While conserved signaling                             pathways are activated at the efforts of receptors, Notch receptor signaling and proteolysis                             is caused by the bing of corresponding ligands.
One interesting feature of Notch signaling is that its intracellular domains, released by                             intramembrane proteolysis during activation, will translocate to the cell nucleus (Schroeter EH et al., 1998) This renders almost no amplification of the signal, and signal orthogonality.
Notch specific ligands are in constant endocytosis-surface presenting cycle in the sender                             cell. When the N terminal recognition domain of Notch is bound to the ligand, this would                             produce resistance that will stimulate the ubiquitylation of the ligand and also enhance                             the recruitment of ubiquitin-binding Epsin endocytic adaptors (Weinmaster G. 2011) .                             Complementary to this model, Ligand and cells defective in endocytosis cannot activate Notch (Nichols JT et al., 2007) .                             This is like a cellular level tug-of-war between the two surface proteins, with the                             Notch receptor eventually giving up. When Notch extracellular domain is not bound by ligands                             with enough affinity or is under disturbances from small molecules, Notch 1 receptor will not                             activate because its negative regulatory region (NRR) will refrain it from being cleaved.

Notch core consists of the negatively regulated region and transmembrane region of the mouse                             Notch 1 receptor. It is the joint that empowers SynNotch the high modularity and proper                             activation 需要参考文献. From the N terminal to C terminal, it is composed of three                             lin12-repeats (LNR) domains LNR-A, LNR-B, LNR-C, the heterodimerization domain (HD),                             and the transmembrane domain. The LNR-AB linker between LNR-A and B is like a plug that                             occludes ADAM from cleaving wild type extracellular domain can be substituted by anti-GFP                             single-chain antibodies like LaG16 and αCD19, while its intracellular domain can be                             replaced by specialized transcription factors. Notch core is the key to the activation                             of both wild type Notch receptors and SynNotch. Lin-12 repeats (LNR) (Vardar et al. 2003) .
The majority of Notch receptors are cleaved during the secretory pathway by furin-like                             convertase at cleavage site 1 (S1) (Logeat et al., 1998) , which protrudes as a part of a linker of the two parts of the Notch negative regulatory                             region's heterodimerization domain (Gordon et al., 2009a; Gordon et al., 2007) .                             This action separates Notch extracellular domain and the Notch transmembrane domain, but                             noncovalent interactions between the heterodimerization domains hold the receptor together.                             Despite disparate results on the role of S1 cleavage is a prerequisite for later activation,                             it has been suggested that it is not required for contact-dependent activation                             on the cell membrane (Gordon et al., 2009b) .
When ligand binds to the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and pulls it with mechanical force                             and thereby activating it, it initiates a process called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (Weinmaster et al., 1997 ; Brou et al. 2000; Gordon et al., 2015) In this process, the Notch receptor is first cleaved at S2 site by two types of metalloproteases in the                             ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease), ADAM10 or ADAM17, with ADAM10 the dominant (Brou et al., 2000; Mumm et al., 2000; Bozkulak et al., 2009) .                             The remaining truncated transmembrane subunit is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase at S3 site,                             and results in the releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The wild type NICD will                             then enter the nucleus and interact with CSL and MAML to activate transcription (Schroteter et al., 1998; Struhl et al., 1998) .
What is different in transcriptional signal output?
The wild type NICD will enter the nucleus and interact with CSL and MAML (Schroteter et al., 1998; Struhl et al., 1998) to regulate endogenous pathways that decide cell fate. The customizable output of SynNotch receptors                             have been integrated with chimeric antigen receptors to engineer T cells with customizable                             therapeutic response programs (Roybal et al., 2016a; Roybal et al., 2016b) , or to                             program self-organizing multicellular structures (Toda et al., 2018) .                             In our ENABLE project, we have used two types of SynNotchs in order to empower mammalian cells                             the ability of binary computation. This promises more novel application potentials. Please                             continue the reading of our Results on intracellular binary logic gates.

Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                         and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.
