We interviewed and discussed with Dr. Xinjun Yu from the Institute of Immunology, Dr. Lixin Yang from the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Changhai Hospital, Dr. Xiaoying Bi from Department of Neurology of Changhai Hospital and Dr. Pengfei Luo from the Burn Research Center. Their feedback could help us a lot in the optimization of our project.</P><H3>Dr. Yu from the Institute of Immunology</H3><UL>
                            As an established immune cell researcher, his comments were mainly on comparison between our project and CAR-T. From the perspective of his research, he gave us several enlightening suggestions, summarized as follows:
                            <LI>Compared to CAR-T, our project could make immune cells perform more complex tasks, or even solid tumor treatment, where CAR-T has limited effect</LI><LI>Regarding application, we can try to achieve an assorted ‘army’ of immune cells for combined cancer treatment</LI><LI> The early design of our logic circuits was not unified. This might cause inconveniences to users and limit its usage</LI><LI> We have to form a systematic debugging process, to reduce the experimental difficulty and improve efficiency in the lab</LI></UL><H3>Dr. Bi from Department of Neurology of Changhai Hospital</H3><P>
                            Director Bi, as an expert in neurology, has a great interest in synthetic biology. She fully affirmed the potential of our project, but also expressed her doubts. She pointed out that the intensity of many cell membrane surface ligand in the brain might not be as strong as we had expected, especially in the early stages of disease development, so the input signal is often very weak. However, the early stage of neurological diseases is the most crucial time for successful treatment with better recovery potential. Therefore, if the clinical neurological applications of our project should work ideally, it requires us to adjust our system for higher sensitivity. Intrigued and excited by our project, she delightfully invited us to have another round of discussion after iGEM. </P><H3>Dr. Yang from the Department of Thoracic Surgery</H3><UL>
                            Director Yang has high hopes for our project’s application in precise cancer therapy. As an experienced surgeon and a clinical oncologist, he expressed his expectations and anxiety for new cancer treatments. His main concern was about the effectiveness and safety of our tools in cancer treatment, as summarized below:
                            <LI> The more comprehensive function immune cells achieve, the larger and more complex the logic system has to be. The construction and delivery of such a system will be a big challenge.</LI><LI> Simplify and unify our design as much as possible to enhance robustness and to avoid unforeseen problems.</LI><LI> Enhance our target precision to prevent unnecessary damage to healthy tissues</LI></UL><H3>Dr. Pengfei Luo from the Burn Research Center</H3><P>
                            Dr. Luo mainly engages in translational medical research on burnt skin regeneration. He proposed that one application of our project could try to achieve precisely controlled skin regeneration so that the repair activities of the engineered cells can be activated or terminated under certain situations. After this fruitful interview, we expressed our willingness to the relevant application design after we completed the project improvement, and our proposal was welcomed by him. At the same time, he put forward the following suggestions to us:In the transmembrane signal transduction process, the loss of signal may cause the activation signal to be too weak to activate the expression of the downstream target.In our early project design, some logic gates contain too many layers of regulation and expression. Therefore, it may face signal interference problems.

On our second joint meeting with them, we discussed in detail the application prospects of our project.

                            Stroke, as a high-risk cerebrovascular disease, has the characteristics of rapid onset, high mortality and poor prognosis. More importantly, the incidence of stroke has gradually increased in recent years and is becoming one of the leading causes of death and paralysis.
                        </P><P>Unfortunately, current treatments can only palliate damage to brain tissue through early hemostasis/vascular dredges. Early damage prevention and functional repair of brain tissue have not been realized, which is one of the biggest problems encountered in neurology.</P><UL>
                            Attempts have been made to repair brain tissue damage using stem cells. However, this approach has the following disadvantages:
                            <LI>Stem cells that are not precisely controlled, therefore have a risk of tumor formation in the body</LI><LI>The effect of stem cell treatment is questionable, and the mechanism of its effect in vivo is not clear</LI><LI>At present, stem cells are mainly transported to the lesion through stereotactic annotation, which cannot treat deep brain damage</LI><LI>The inner/periphery of the brain tissue after necrosis lacks the microenvironment that stimulates stem cells to differentiate into neurons.

                            This ENABLE solution enables sensitive identification of brain damage and the prevention of further injury (such as cerebral hemorrhage and apoptosis activation) in a timely manner while creating a microenvironment suitable for neuronal differentiation. After completing the corresponding task, the circuit will be off, and the system will not run out of control.
                            <B>It has the following advantages:</B><LI>Accurate positioning of engineered cells, and work status reports for visualization of treatment stage</LI><LI>Provide a suitable microenvironment for neuronal repair</LI><LI>The repair process is controllable and can be terminated at a given time</LI><LI>It could be injected into the brain in advance for patients with high risk of brain diseases, to protect and repair brain tissue immediately after the damage, to act as vaccines.</LI></UL><H3>Smart skin regeneration</H3><P>
                            In our discussions with Dr. Luo, we learned that the current tissue differentiation is mostly done in vitro, which leads to morphological mismatch and possible risk of immune rejection. Especially in skin replantation, in vitro induction means that patients need to endure long waits and insufficient efficiency of skin grafting. Also, the natural repair relies heavily on the previously infected tissue, which means that it is currently impossible to achieve complete sterility of the patient's skin surface. There is an urgent need in the clinic for an alternative method for skin replantation.
                        </P><P>From Dr. Luo’s unpublished research results, we learned that Smad3 is an essential signaling factor in skin regeneration. Its expression determines the differentiation fate of cells in different parts. We propose to build a Smad3 NIMPLY gate for mesenchymal cells. Engineered cells will achieve different differentiation stages at different sites, to make smart skin regeneration.</P><UL><LI> Under normal conditions (TLR4 is not expressed in skin cells), the ENABLE cells remains silent.
                            </LI><LI>When the skin is damaged, TLR4 is expressed on the cell surface <A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11357875
" target="_blank">(Takeuchi O, et al.)</A>. When only TLR4 is present, our NIMPLY gate recognizes it and activates the downstream Smad3 expression. When Smad3 is highly expressed, the edited mesenchymal cells differentiate into fibroblasts, which will repair the dermis.
                        </LI><LI>MCH Class II expresses on melanocytes and Langerhans cells, but not on fibroblasts <A href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19659579
" target="_blank">(Plonka PM, et al.)</A>. When the repair proceeds to the epidermal layer, the edited cells recognize both TLR4 and MCH Class II, NIMPLY gate will down-regulate the Smad3 expression. Mesenchymal cells that recognize MCH Class II also express MCH Class II, which inhibits the expression of Smad3 once cells have already differentiated.</LI></UL><P><B>The smart skin repair solution we designed has the following advantages:</B>
                            1. Respond quickly after skin burns, and can, to some extent, reduce secondary damage to the skin;
                            2. Enable different responses in different layers of skin, promote the repair of the epidermis, avoid the proliferation of the dermis and prevent the appearance of scar tissue;
                            3. Simulate skin repair within the damaged area as much as possible. This avoids mismatch caused by skin replantation;
                            4. Minimize the possibility of infection during surgical operations

                        Some of these applications still have a long to be realized, but they are feasible and could help these doctors solve the most urgent problems in their fields.

We must always remember <I>why we initiated the research</I> and <I>why we work hard in the lab</I> - for the good of the people, including ourselves.</P></DIV><DIV class="section container"><H4 style="margin-left: 0;">References</H4><OL id="ref" style="margin: 23px 0 0 0;"><LI>Anderson MA, O'Shea TM, Burda JE, ..., Courtine G, Sofroniew MV.

                        events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between
                        cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a
                        complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of
                        3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic
                        Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the
                        membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by
                        transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based
                        transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.
                        In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,
                        and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,
                        cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing
                        contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle
                        underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,
                        thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.
