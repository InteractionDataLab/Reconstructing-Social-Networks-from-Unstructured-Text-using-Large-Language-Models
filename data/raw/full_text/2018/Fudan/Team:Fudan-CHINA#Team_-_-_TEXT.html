What Our Members Say
If you have a workaholic colleague, then you will have a lot less things. If you have a workaholic team leader, then you will be squeezed to work day and night with him. I am sorry, sincerely.
—Kaifeng Jin
Like the competition, the experiments and all the work I've done. But what amazes me the most is the fact that my love for biology and laboratory is always here in my heart.
—Zixuan Zhang

Believe it or not - it’s my third time participating in iGEM competition! I took part in iGEM twice in ‘14 and ‘15 back in high school years and it was my experience with iGEM that brought me into majoring in biology in university. This year, I am a wet lab squad member for Team Fudan-CHINA mainly responsible for molecular cloning of our STEP system and protein expression. I hope we can all enjoy beautiful world of life science :)
—Yineng Zhou
A word of my iGEM is 'HProtein' :P Unforgettable experience. Contacting experts of different fields. Every-day struggle with E.coli and protein. Lovely team members. Bubble milktea every night. Many thanks for Leslie's support.
—Haichen Hu
I go wherever team needs me. And I also made two short videos on the wiki. Love photography and film editing. But hate Adobe every time it crashes. Planning to make a vlog about Boston. Please subscribe my youtube channel to watch more!
