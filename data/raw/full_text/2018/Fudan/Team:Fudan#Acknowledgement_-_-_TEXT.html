Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                         and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.
