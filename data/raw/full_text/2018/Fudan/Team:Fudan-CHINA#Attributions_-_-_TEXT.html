"No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent."
We are incredibly thankful to all those who have helped us during the competition. We couldn’t have done our project without your help. Thank you very much!

Idea
Our project was inspired by the work performed by KA Schwarz, NM Daringer, TB Dolberg and JN Leonard, described in their 2016 paper "Rewiring human cellular input-output using modular extracellular sensors." We made some modification and improvement based on their work.

Project
Pro.f Qiang Huang is experienced in protein structure. He taught us how to use Rosetta to predict protein structure and simulate docking surface. He also helped us brainstorm and give useful suggestions on presentation.
Associate Pro.f Wei Mo helped us brainstorm and presentation modification early in the project. He also provide us with his lab for molecular cloning and cell culture.
Pro.f Jiaxue Wu allowed us to use his lab to perform molecular cloning and cell culture. He also offer a room for us to rest and discuss.
Pro.f Liang Cai and Associate Pro.f Xiaoming Ding offered many suggestions about our project design and presentation skills.
Dr. Litao Xu showed us the procedures and specifications of clinical trials, and affirmed the clinical application value of VEGF as a target in our project.
Haotian Guo suggested us refining the basic assumptions of our dry experiment and use more intuitive images as a result when introducing projects to the outside world.
Lab
Yun Shi is a Ph.D student in Fudan University and she is skilled at various experimental skills. She taught us lot about basic experiments and safety regulations. She also accepted our interview as a normal researcher.
Zijie Yang, Ziyan Yu, Tian Huang, Yiheng Wang, Yinjie Pan, Yiming Cai are higher grade students and former IGEM member as well. They held a training in January helping us with basic synthetic biology theory.
Shanghai Medical College held many lectures and training about safety regulation last year. We learned a lot from that.
Dongmei Xue, a master student major in biology, help us purify the protein once.
Material
Associate Pro.f Wei Mo provided us with pIRES and pcDNA3.1 backbones.
Hao Li is a master student major in biology. He gave us GTS column.
Funding
Thanks for Yunfeng Capital's support.
Wiki
Peiyan Xia , an undergraduate student major in computer science as well as the boyfriend of one of our team member, helped design wiki frame.
Additional
Hao Tian helped draw comics for our collaboration "funniest reason leading to failure".
Hao Zheng helped draw animation elements used in introduction video.
