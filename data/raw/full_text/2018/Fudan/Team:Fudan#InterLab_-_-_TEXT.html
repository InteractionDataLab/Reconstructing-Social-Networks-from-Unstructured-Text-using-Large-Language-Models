This year, we had the pleasure of participating in iGEM’s Fifth International InterLaboratory                                     Measurement Study in synthetic biology. As taking reliable and repeatable measurements is crucial in synthetic biology, the Measurement Committee has been using the InterLab                                     Study to develop a powerful and accurate measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein                                     (GFP) by measuring it in absolute fluorescence units calibrated against a known concentration                                     of fluorescent molecules. Nevertheless, a new problem emerges when we take bulk measurements                                     of cell populations as the number of cells in the sample remains a large source of variability.                                     Thus, the aim of this year’s Interlab study is to determine the cell count in each sample to                                     remove the variability of cell populations in measurements of different labs. More concretely,                                     we hope to discover if this can be achieved by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming                                     units (CFUs) instead of OD.
Regarding experimental procedures, we used two orthogonal approaches to calculate the cell count in our samples:
1. Using silica beads to convert absorbance of cells into absorbance of a known concentration of beads.
2. Counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from the sample
We are first required to make three sets of unit calibration measurements: an OD600 reference point, particle standard curve, and a fluorescein standard curve. It is also important that we use the same plates, volumes, and settings as what we will use for our cell-based assays for the calibration measurements. The plate reader we used was the Biotek Cytation 3.
Calibration 1:​
OD​600​ Reference point - LUDOX Protocol
This calibration is to allow us to obtain a conversion factor which allows us to transform our                             absorbance (Abs600) data from the plate reader into a comparable OD600 measurement. This conversion is necessary as measurements of absorbance are dependent on volume, and the path length of the light defined by the fluid in the wells of the plate reader is unfixed and can vary from well to well.
Below is the data we obtained:

Calibration 2:​
Particle Standard Curve - Microsphere Protocol
For the second calibration, we performed a series of dilutions for the monodisperse silica microsphere                             and measured their Abs600 in the plate reader. A standard curve of particle concentration was also                             constructed to convert Abs600 measurements to a cell number estimate.

Calibration 3:​
Fluorescence standard curve - Fluorescein Protocol
For the third calibration, we hope to create a standard fluorescence curve in order to enable                                 different teams to compare their fluorescence outputs. Therefore, we will prepare a serial                                 dilution of fluorescein in four replicates and measure its fluorescence in a 96 well plate in the                                 plate reader. Once measured, we can construct a standard fluorescence curve and use it to convert                                 our cell-based readings to a corresponding fluorescein concentration.

Figure 4. Fluorescein Standard Curve (log scale) of Fluorescein Concentration (uM) to Fluorescence
For the fluorescence standard curve, we used a gain setting of 50 and a filter that passes a light                             wavelength of 528 nm / 20 nm. We had an emission wavelength of 525 and an excitation wavelength of 488.
Cell Measurement
We used E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha for our cell measurements and maintained all the same plates, volumes, and settings in our calibration process to ensure that the measurements are valid.

Regarding the observations during the experiment, it should be noted that our LB medium had                             an innately low fluorescence intensity. Also, from the data, we observed that the Abs600 growth for Device 4 was limited but it is still possible to test its fluorescence. Moreover,                             regarding the dilution of target Abs600 of 0.02, we first measured the 1:8 dilution of the                                     overnight cultures and using the equations provided in the protocol, we calculated the amounts                             of source and LB needed to obtain the target Abs600 of 0.02.
Protocol:
Colony Forming Units per 0.1 OD600 E. coli cultures
For the CFU protocol, which is used to calibrate OD600 to colony forming unit counts, we have 2                                     Positive Control cultures and 2 Negative Control cultures. Our goal is to get the colony                             forming units (CFU) per 1mL of an OD600 = 0.1 culture.

Table 14. Number of colonies of BBa_R0040 Culture and BBa_I20270 Culture of Dilution 4 and its corresponding CFU per 1mL of an OD600 = 0.1 culture
We successfully calibrated our OD600 to colony forming unit counts as we were fairly accurate in ensuring that the OD600 values were close to 0.1, which we believed was the most crucial part of the CFU protocol. Moreover, we utilized the data from dilution 4 for the conversion because it has the best countable number which is between 50 to 200 colonies.
We were fairly successful in completing the Interlab project as it was accepted by the iGEM committee the first time we submitted it. It was really quite an enjoyable side project to perform and to practice our experimental techniques in the lab.
Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                             events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                             cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                             complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                             3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                             Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                             membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                             transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                             transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                             In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                             and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                             cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                             contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                             underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                             thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.
