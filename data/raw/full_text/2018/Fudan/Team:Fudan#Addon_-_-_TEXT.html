HOW TO IMPLANT ENABLEribocomputing
Complex cellular logic computation using ribocomputing devices. Green AA, Kim J, Ma D, ..., Collins JJ, Yin P.
Nature, 2017 Aug;548(7665):117-121 PMID: 28746304; DOI: 10.1038/nature23271

In summary
The ribocomputing devices they have developed in bacteria use RNA molecules as input signals and use whether or not producing a designed protein as the output.
Their RNA-based biological circuits exploit the programmable base-pairing properties of RNA.
The gate RNA carries out the signal processing by combining sensing and output modules to enable complex intracellular computations in a single circuit layer.
AND, OR and NOT logic were built from self-assembly of input RNAs and gate RNAs. Input RNAs can interact with one another cooperatively to activate a gate RNA for AND logic, or to inhibit another gate RNA for NOT logic. Inputs that could bind to separated sensor domains on a third gate RNA can trigger protein production and thus used for OR logic.

Strengths of Ribocomputing circuits
Easy to scale up.
Use synthetic RNAs and operate purely at the post-transcriptional level with no intermediate transcriptional or translational steps, which minimizes delays and improves the reliability of signal transduction.
In principle, it could be applied in prokaryotic hosts beyond E. coli.

ENABLEribocomputing
ENABLEribocomputing will use our Receptors to pass the signal across the membrane and will use our transcriptional module to amplify the production of Ribocomputing input RNAs. Ribocomputing AND gate RNAs should be stably produced. The computation by input and gate RNAs will behave as our Combinator to execute binary logic functions.

In summary
This study has shown that TALE-NOR gates can be combined to form all 16 binary logic gates.
Before this study, knowing the specific binding nucleotide sequences of TALEs (transcription activator-like effectors) has enabled people to design and construct a large number of protein domains that can bind almost any nucleotide sequence in genomes (Moscou MJ, et al., 2009; Boch J, et al., 2009) . Moreover, fusing DNA sequence-binding TALE domains with the effector domain has been used to construct either transcriptional activators or repressors. These fusions have been proven orthogonal (Garg A, et al., 2012; Cong L, et al., 2012) .
In this study, the authors used designable TALE repressors to construct the orthogonal NOR gates in HEK293T cells, serving as complex information-processing devices (like our Collectors). They used TALE repressors to serve as both their input and output of their genetic logic gates. They have demonstrated 16 two-input logic functions in transiently transfected mammalian cells from the combinations of the same type of orthogonal TALE repressor-based NOR gates. Furthermore, they also designed a NOR logic function that accepts three inputs and emulates logic functions.
The authors suggested that their platform can enable the design of any advanced information processing devices in mammalian cells that can take any signal combination as input and convert into a transcriptional output.

Strengths of TALE-NOR gates
The NOR gates can be optimized by placing the operators upstream from the promoter as it produces minimal variability in reporter expression and retains efficient repression.
The same type of NOR gates can be used for all their circuit functions and allows for the construction of complex circuits with precision and interoperability.
The implementation of TALE-based cellular circuits could be easily extended to other cellular chassis, such as yeast or bacteria.
TALEs can accommodate only one or two mismatches out of the 18-nucleotide-recognition site, supporting the potential for large orthogonality.

Using NAND gate as an example

The logic connectivity of biological NOR gates and experimental results from the firefly luciferase and confocal microscopy are shown, with the truth table below the luciferase reporter results. Their NAND gate, constructed from two NOR gates, will produce an output if at least one of the two signals is off.  Only those TALE binding sites that were functionally relevant for the circuit are illustrated. The appropriate combination of processing logic and input plasmids were introduced into HEK293T cells for each combination of input values. Values are the mean of n = 4 ± s.d. For all functions, the statistical significance of the separation between the high and low states is significant at the level *** P < 0.001. Microscopic images are representative of five separate observations. Scale bars, 125 μm. nRLU, normalized relative light units.
ENABLETALE-NOR
ENABLETALE-NOR will use our Receptors to pass the signal across the membrane and will use our transcriptional modules to amplify the production of TALE-NOR transcription factors. Different combinations of TALE-NOR will behave as our Combinator to execute binary logic functions.

In summary
The authors used RNA-binding proteins and their RNA target units to create a set of synthetic transcription-translation control devices that can be rewired in a plug-and-play manner.
The transcription factors are triggered in the sense that they are activated only when they interact with specific inputs.
They use RNA-binding proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts containing specific RNA target units.
They used a half-subtractor and half-adder to perform fundamental arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) of two bits. Their half-subtractor was made by a combination of the XOR gate and the NIMPLY gate. Their half-adder was made by a combination of the XOR gate and the AND gate. For more details, please refer to Figure 4.
They have achieved two-input-two-output integration.

Strengths of transcription-translation control devices
These transcription-translation control devices are rational and has a predictable plug-and-play characteristic. Individual components can be readily rewired to perform computing activities, such as NOT, NAND, and NIMPLY.
Their single-cell biocomputers are scalable to tissue structures and are straightforward to wire with host metabolism to have therapeutic impact.

ENABLE transcription-translation control devices
ENABLEtranscription-translation (ENABLET2) will use our Receptors to pass the signal across the membrane and will use our transcriptional module to amplify the production of trigger-controlled transcription factors, including both RNA-binding proteins and their RNA target units. Different combinations of trigger-controlled transcription factors will behave as our combinator to execute binary logic functions.

Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                             events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                             cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                             complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                             3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                             Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                             membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                             transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                             transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                             In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                             and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                             cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                             contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                             underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                             thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.
