Introduction
As art is a universal language, we decided to connect our logic gates and biology with art to convey our project to everyone regardless of their previous knowledge and background.
However, how should we introduce concepts in synthetic biology clearly and attractively? Since most people consider experiments and logic gates as too complicated, we decided to include hands-on interactive art activities in our human practice (HP) to allow the audience to appreciate the creative merging of art and science. We hope to encourage them to understand what is synthetic biology by using art as a novel way of thinking and comprehending. This is undoubtedly something that few have tried before in iGEM!
Our event invites viewers to join us and experience some of the daily activities in the lab.
That is why we use the word "display" to emphasize this event.
Our event name is "CELL•LEGO•LOGIC" Bio-Art Display. We tried to use LEGO to indicate the core concept of synthetic biology as "CELL" and "LOGIC" are the two main parts of our project. For the word "Display", its prefix "dis-" means "negative", and "play(-plic-)" means "fold". Thus, when the two meanings are combined together, it highlights our purpose "to unfold".
The Display name is "CELL•LEGO•LOGIC".
Different from previous HP projects, our Display is planned to be as transparent as possible, which means that we not only mention the advantages of synthetic biology but more importantly also the problems behind it. In the Display, we include topics still under debate, like "genetically modified food", "artificial tissue" and so on, hoping to make people realize all the effects of synthetic biology upon society comprehensively.

LEGO and synthetic biology
What is the link between LEGO and synthetic biology? LEGO and synthetic biology are both special in that both are able to use standardized fundamental building blocks to build something amazing and completely new; the only thing you need is your determination, imagination, and a pair of skillful hands! As a result, the first section of our display focuses on using LEGOs to explain synthetic biology. But aside from helping people better understand what is synthetic biology, more importantly we want to impart them with this spirit of invention and the thrill of building something up from scratch and basic parts. As can be seen in the photos below, the visitors greatly enjoyed this activity and didn't fail to amaze us with many wonderful creations!
Electrical Logic Gates
During our previous HP events and in our attempts at trying to convey our project to other people, logic gates have always been a difficult part for the audience to understand as they always struggled to grasp the logic or mechanism behind it. Reflecting upon this problem, we found out a fundamental flaw: we never provided the chance for the audience to personally construct and learn hands-on what a logic gate is. Teaching people the abstract theory of logic gates is important, but letting them physically analyze and construct a sample logic gate in person is even more critical and effective. Thus, what could be better than to return to the root of logic functions, and describe it using actual constructible electrical wire circuits, electrical boards, and lightbulbs! This visual experiment would finally grant the audience a long needed physical representation of the originally quite theoretically complex logic gates. Therefore, with this set up, the visitors efficiently learned the basic principles of logic gates, including how the input signals are relayed, how the outputs are produced, and different combinations that are possible for this process to happen. Some were even able to form several other fundamental logic gates themselves. This activity not only greatly enhanced their interest and level of understanding but also served as a strong representation of our constant desire to improve every part of our project and our focus on promoting human interaction and involvement at each step in our project using innovative and interesting methods.
Hands-on drawing
As part of our goal to make people understand biology through a novel and more creative approach, we decided to connect art and synthetic biology by letting the audience to portray their thoughts and views about our project and synthetic biology artistically by presenting them vividly on sheets of paper. This drawing activity not only stimulates them to process the information they receive into logical corresponding images, but also enables them to add in their own authenticity and imaginations into these images. In this way, we were able to collect works of art that symbolizes their passion and fascination of what synthetic biology is and what it can be. For instance, after we explained to them the concept of logic gates, they were given the choice of drawing their own logic gates on paper. With this single theme alone, we have already collected a multitude of great works. Although they all link to the general theme, but are portrayed in concepts and styles that are so diverse and unique. We hope that this art activity can also make people realize the uniqueness, independence, and creativity that is similarly reflected in synthetic biology research.

Access to Interactive Lab
Having the privilege to work in a laboratory, we hope to allow the public to also experience what it is like to perform some basic scientific experiments. This may even bring the inner scientist out of them. Thus, our interactive lab presented the audience with a "lab model" that we built, including many laboratory equipment (already sterilized for safety) that are often used. This enhances the visitor’s experience since they are able to personally try out and learn each equipment and experimental techniques. At the same time, we also presented various interesting photographs to aid the visitors in understanding our lab even better.  Of course, while in the lab, safety would be the highest priority. Therefore, during the interaction with the visitors, we also conducted some training on laboratory safety and delivered some basic sterility procedures to them that applied not only in the cell culture room, but also to the maintenance of a healthy habit in their daily lives.
Details and Feedbacks
In consideration that not everyone has a deep understanding of synthetic biology and our project, we carefully designed a brochure to guide the audience to know what to do in our Display. Viewers were further encouraged to write down their suggestions about the Display and their views about the ethical problems in synthetic biology.
Bio-Art Display was hugely successful as not only did we collect a lot of useful feedback, which provided us with new insights on public perspectives about synthetic biology and our project, as well as successfully spread awareness about these issues in a novel but easily understood way!
Some of the feedbacks are summarized below:
Most people support the genetic manipulation of cells because the advancement of technology will always require some experimentation. Furthermore, if genetic manipulation can be used in medical treatments, it will definitely have a positive impact on the world.
Our projects use "Binary" as a language for cells to communicate, but this usage actually raised discussions between audiences and our team members. For computers, binary is, of course, the simplest way of thinking. However, is this also true for cells? Alternatively, what is the basic language for intelligence?
"Genetically modified organisms (GMO)" is a hot topic in China because people always care about things that are closely related to them. As a result, visitors are all very curious about whether GMO will harm their health.
A feedback about the display itself. It is thought that the coverage of the Display is too broad. Therefore, it would be better if we could choose a more specific topic to discuss in the future.

Abstract
Contact-dependent signaling is critical for multicellular biological                         events, yet customizing contact-dependent signal transduction between                         cells remains challenging. Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a                         complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of                         3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic                         Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the                         membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by                         transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based                         transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products.                         In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells,                         and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering,                         cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing                         contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle                         underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits,                         thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.
