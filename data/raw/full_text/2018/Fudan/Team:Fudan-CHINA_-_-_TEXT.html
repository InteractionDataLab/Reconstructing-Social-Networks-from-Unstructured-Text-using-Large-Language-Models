A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO STEP
Troubling the world for years, cancer has long been a major threat to people's health. The rapidly developing cell therapy has proved its potential for cancer treatment, but all of the current biosensors, from CAR to SynNotch, lack either programmability or orthogonality, which could significantly restrict its clinical application.
We provide our own solution to the problem, the Synthetic Transducer Engineering Platform (STEP). Consisting of two transmembrane chains with ligand receptor on the extracellular domain and protease/transcription factor pair on the intracellular domain, it can achieve high modularity as well as orthogonality in both upstream and downstream. Through our experiments and models, we've successfully proved the reliability and tunability of STEP, and are trying to find the best condition for its real application.
By using STEP in clinical researches and practices, treatment best suited for cancer patients can be developed. With further researches and optimisation, we believe it will reveal its full potential.
