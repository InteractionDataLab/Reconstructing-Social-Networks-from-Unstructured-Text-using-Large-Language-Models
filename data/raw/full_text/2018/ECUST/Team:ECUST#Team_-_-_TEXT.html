MEMBERS
The 2018 ECUST team consists of 14 undergraduate students from different majors, who are energetic, considerate, and diligent. They design and develop the project independently and try their best to make contributions to synthetic biology and the whole world. At the same time, they were also instructed by several teachers from East China University of Science and Technology, who escorted the 2018 ECUST iGEM.
