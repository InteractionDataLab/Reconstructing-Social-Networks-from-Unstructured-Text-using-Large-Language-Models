Collaboration is at the heart of iGEM, they not only allow teams to help each other in their proects but establishes bonds that cut accross borders,languages and disciplines.

IISER Mohali is proud to share its collaboration efforts with</P><DIV class="single_bloginner s_blogIner_3 margin-top-60"><H5 style="margin-top:100px;">Brothers from other Mothers-ICT- Mumbai
                                            </H5><P>In the present edition of iGEM ,Team ICT-Mumbai is venturing into an adventurous task of engineering a chassis bacteria:Bacillus Subtilis to detect the particular plant ,being grown, in response to fthe extudades They worked on mainlty fours types of crops namely Rice,Wheat,Soybean and Tomato.Since, our institute is located in the heart of the Northern plains of India, ICT-Mumbai wanted us to gather information about the types of crops grown,amount of fertilizers used and diseases widespread in the lush farms in and around the Haryana-Punjab region.</P><P>
Our project kept us in regular touch with the farmers of our community,therefore, we were easily able to get access to the above information.We also were able to understand the amount of knowledge of Phosphate Solubilizing bacteria in the Farmer’s Community.On being questioned about Plant dieseases in their farms, a majoirty of the Farmer’s assusred us that “Weeds” were a biigger concern for them than Plant Diseases.This information allowed us not only provide valuable facts and figures for ICT -Mumbai but alos helped us understand other reasons for harvest losses faced by our farmers, which strengthened our will to succeed in our project.All in all we were more than happy to interact and share this information with our fellow scientists in Mumbai.We hope to see them again at the Giant Jamboree :)
 </P><H5>A friend in need is a friend indeed-IIT Kanpur
</H5><P>
In this year’s version of iGEM, Team IIT Kanpur is targeting an essential societal problem, especially in our country India,Wastewater Management.We were lucky to have been able to get in touch with Mr.Abhinav Soni on Facebook, with whom we were able to conduct a troubleshooting session in order to help each other out with the minor glitches that we were facing.
</P><P>We were able to fully understand and appreciate each other’s projects which also allowed us to predict possible queries and questions that could be raised to our teams at the Giant Jamboree.Since, our team has previous experience competing at the Giant Jamboree, we were also able to give IIT Kanpur an insight about the judging criteria, the poster and the final presentation, which we hope would have been helpful for Team IIT Kanpur.Our interaction with Team Kanpur gave us confidence in our project and prepared us better for the Giant Jamboree.We hope to have a great time with IIT Kanpur at the Giant Jamboree :)
 </P><H5>Knowledge and happiness multiply when shared - VIT Vellore</H5><P>For the year 2018,VIT Vellore has pulled up it’s sleeves and is working on solving a pressing issue that threatens the very existence of humanity,Ocean Acidification.Their project TogglepH, will definitely have a huge impact in the years to come.</P><P>Our interaction with VIT Vellore, started with a WhatsApp text followed by a series of emails,chat over the phone, exchange of MATLAB Scripts.VIT Vellore, communicated to us the difficulties they were facing with the mathematical modelling of their genetic circuits.Since, our team members had a lot of experience with modelling genetic circuits we jumped to the occasion and lended our help to our brothers and sisters in Vellore.We helped them in figuring what simulations could be done and sticked with them until they were successful in finishing  the modelling of their genetic circuits.We hope to meet up and have great fun with VIT Vellore at the Giant Jamboree :)

A beacon of light in the dark-IIT Madras
</H5><P>
For this year’s iGEM Project, Team IIT Madras is working to help synthetic biologists in generating codon usage with their free online tool CUTE (codon usage table enumerator),they have also built a synthetic promoter library for Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1.When the coders in out team got stuck on a particular model we were working on, we realized that we needed the insight of someone with technical background,our first response was “IIT”. They were happy to help to offer their insight in evolving our algorithm and soon we were back on track!We look forward to meeting up with IIT Madras and thanking them in person at the Giant Jamboree!
