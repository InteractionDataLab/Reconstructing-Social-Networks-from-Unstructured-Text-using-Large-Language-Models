FearOmone project was possible because of the tremendous support from our institute and many other people including our professors, instructors, sponsors, team advicers, volunteers, farmers, government organisations, collaborators and experts. We dedicate this page to thank all the people who helped us with the work and because of them our project was made possible.
Apart from the institute and members of the team, we got an immense support from the stakeholders whom we managed to call for discussion at "Stakeholders Meetup". Their constant input and support helped us mold our project design at different stages.
We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude towards our sponsors and well wishers. Special thanks to our patrons from Ketto who's active involvement has helped bring FearOmone a step closer to society.
