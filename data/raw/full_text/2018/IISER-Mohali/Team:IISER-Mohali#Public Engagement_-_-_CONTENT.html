Farmers, the general public, researchers, industrialists, and policymakers shape the future of FearOmone, so we held a Stakeholders' Meetup on October 13th, 2018, to take their input and address their concerns in an open forum.

                                                    Our project was delivered at different technical levels to cater to everyone. The event was successful, and helped us establish further contact with state owned enterprises (SOEs). Apart from formal meetings like these, our members have personally traveled to nearby villages, to assess the ground reality of murine infestation based problems. We thank Mr. Mohan Singh, the Sarpanch (village leader) of the nearby village of Raipur Khurd, for facilitating the same.

With a 2.5 million plus strong supporter base, thousands of fundraisers have seen light at the end of the tunnel due to numerous anonymous well wishers. We are amazed to see how in the matter of three days, Ketto managed to take us to over the halfway mark of our overall donations! Initially, we were skeptical about public opinion of our project, but it was a reassuring sight to see anonymous donors pouring in with support! A little help from the masses is equal to massive help, and Ketto exemplifies the same.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">
                                                    Speaking of anonymous, the Reddit community (<A href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/9ln37c/an_innovative_idea_to_save_30_of_indias_food/">r/IndiaSpeaks</A> and <A href="https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9lviuj/an_innovative_idea_to_save_30_of_indias_food/">r/india</A>) has been an invaluable partner to us. After sharing the details of FearOmone with Redditors, they were prompt to commend us for a solution to what was evidently a pervasive problem. At the same time, they highlighted vulnerabilities in our project design which together with questions from the Stakeholders’ Meetup, remind us of hurdles we still face. Indeed, our project is far from over!

                                                    IISER Mohali’s music club, Aria, is the largest one on campus based on membership. It took us little time to realize the potential of a collaboration with Aria, making it the fastest way to communicate our work. However, we also pondered as to how the music club managed to gain so much recognition. While the efforts of the club itself are laudable, we quote here a saying by Vishwas Kamal, convener of Aria:
                                                </P><H5 style="text-align: center;">“The intrinsic power of music as a way to communicate thoughts and emotions lends to its appeal with the masses. Words may be heard, but music is felt.”</H5><P style="text-align: justify;">Music has proved to be an effective tool in teaching. Just imagine: if prosody can bring life to boring lectures, what would happen if we went one step further? That’s exactly what we did with our Science through Music initiative.
                                                </P><P style="text-align: justify;">
                                                    Together, we’ve created a music video parody of the viral Kiki challenge to promote lab safety and adherence to protocols (which is hilariously ironic, but effective nevertheless!). Also, our collaborative rendition of AsapSCIENCE’s Periodic Table Song serves to help children remember elements well beyond neon, as a musical mnemonic. Several fun hours have been dedicated to the making of our content, and we hope to spend many more in the coming months!
