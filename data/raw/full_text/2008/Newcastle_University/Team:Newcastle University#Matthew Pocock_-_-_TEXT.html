Matthew Pocock
Matthew Pocock is a staff member of the 2008 Newcastle University iGEM Team . He was involved with the in-silico part of the project, providing support to the students during the design and development of the Java, database and web-service components.
Matthew's academic interests include software architecture, distributed computing, evolutionary computing, evolutionary biology, data integration, ontologies, and modelling of biological systems. He sees synthetic biology as the natural extension of existing classical and systems approaches to understanding how biological systems actually function. You don't understand it until you can build one yourself.
