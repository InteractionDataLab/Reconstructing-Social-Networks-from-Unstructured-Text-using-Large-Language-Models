This Brick demonstrates that it is possible to transfer two-component peptide sensing from one strain into another and have it function as it did in the first strain. We took the subtilin two component system from <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> ATCC6633 and integrated it into the chromosome of <I>B. subtilis</I> 168, the typical laboratory <I>B. subtilis</I> strain at the <I>amyE</I> locus.

For plasmid pGFP-ncl08 and pGFP-agr, bacillus was plated on chloramphenicl (5 microG/ml) and for plasmid pJWV021-ncl08, bacillus were plated on kanamycin (5 microG/ml). Next day, Bacillus transformants were subseqently streaked to single colonies on selective agar plates. To check for correct integration of the pGFP-ncl08 and pGFP-agr plasmids at the amyE locus, single colonies were streaked on nutrient agar plates containing 1% starch. If a double crossover event occured, cells are not able to produce AmyE and will not degrade starch, thus no 'halo' around the colony. 2 individual colonies without an halo were grown and stocked and used for later analyses. To check correct integration of the pJWV021-ncl08 plasmid in the Bacillus chromosome, single colonies were streaked on minimal medium plates containing either glucose or sucrose as the sole carbon source. If the plasmid integrated correctly at the sacA locus via a double crossover, cells cannot utilise sucrose anymore and will not grow on the minimal plate containing sucrose, but will grow on the glucose plate. Again, 2 correct transformants were selected that were unable to proliferate on sucrose plates and stocked in the -80C freezer for future work.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Microscopy">Microscopy</SPAN></H3><P>Microscopy work from 08.09.08 showed a difference in the level of flourescence of the iGEMgfp fluorescent cells (higher in 10% subtilin-induced cells compared to 0% subtilin-induced cells). However, there was little difference in the <I>number</I> of cells that fluoresced between the two cultures. 
</P><P>There was no difference in the number of fluorecent cells <I>or</I> the level of fluorescence between the 10% subtilin-induced and the 0% subtilin-induced iGEMcherry cells.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Flow_cytometry">Flow cytometry</SPAN></H3><P>Flow cytometry measures cell fluorescence and light scattering, cell-by-cell, allowing us to quantify our results and present them in graphical form.  A sample of our cells engineered <I>B. subtilis</I> cells were injected into the machine, which hydro-dynamically focusses the fluid. Lasers of a particular wavelength are directed onto the stream of fluid, and each particle which passes through the light beam will cause the laser to scatter in a different way. Cells which absorb and then re-emit the light, result in fluorescence (a higher energy state).
</P><P>The detectors in the machine measure the scattering of light and any fluoresence which occurs, and the data is displayed as histograms and dot plots.
</P><P><B>Induction by 0% v/v subtilin</B> (i.e in the absence of subtilin): mean fluoresence = 7.70
</P><P><B>Induction by 1% v/v subtilin:</B> mean fluoresence = 14.77
</P><P><B>Induction by 10% v/v subtilin:</B> the mean fluoresence = 21.95
</P><P>These results show that the higher the concentration of subtilin, the more GFP is expressed.
</P><P>At 10% induction, the subtilin began to cause some of the cells to lyse - this can be seen by the two distinct populations of cells - one being the cells which have lysed, and the other being the remainder of intact cells.  Since subtilin is an antibiotic, this was a good indication that the subtilin we had collected that day was of good quality.
</P><P>Overall, the microscopy and flow cytometry suggest that our biobrick is functional, but requires high levels of subtilin in order to be activated. The days that we performed microscopy for instance, we did not observe killing of the cells after 10% addition of subtilin, indicating that our subtilin for that day was at a low concentration. Subsequently, we did not observe a strong GFP induction. However, when we did observe killing (indicative of high subtilin concentrations), we did observe induction of GFP (see flow cytometry). So in principle the system works, and we have engineered the lab strain of <I>B. subtilis</I> 168 to respond to the external addition of subtilin, but more work should be done to further optimise the system. For instance, it was shown that the spaS promoter fused to gfp gives high yield of protein production when present on a multicopy plasmid, after the addition of subtilin (Bongers et al, AEM). Also it may be possible to introduce a positive feedback effect by introducing a <I>spaS</I> box and associated promoter upstream of <I>spaRK</I> in addition to the normal promoter.
