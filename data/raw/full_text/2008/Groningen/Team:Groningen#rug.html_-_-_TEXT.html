Location of Groningen.
The Center For Synthetic Biology
Three leading research centers at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials , the Stratingh Institute and the Groningen Biomolecular and Biotechnology institute) created a new interdisciplinary research institute to focus on and accelerate the emerging field of Synthetic Biology. This Center for Synthetic Biology is aiming to have scientists from varying disciplines i.e. engineers, physicians, biochemists and bioinformatics working together to approach biology from a new point of view, therefore the first step will be to attract scientists to work in this center. There will be a workshop on synthetic biology in Groningen in November.
One of the first activities of the CSB was the creation of a student team for the iGEM competition!
