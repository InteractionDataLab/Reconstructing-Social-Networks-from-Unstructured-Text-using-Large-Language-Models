Single-Cell Model Files
These files where used to model the single cell interval switch:
Note: please be sure to rename all the files below after downloading, with the correct extension as indicated in the table! They are not all text files!
ModelBrickReadme.txt
Readme for ModelBrick Assembler
mba.m
MATLAB script file for automatic assembly of modelbricks. (Not text!)
modelbricks.zip
contains all parts used in .xml format. (Not text!)
partslibrary.mat
MATLAB workspace file containing all parts used in SimBiology model format. (Not text!)
Intervalswitch.sbproj
This SimBiology project file contains the complete, assembled, interval switch. The 'diagram overview' option shows the structure of the model. The 'model tasks - conserved cycles' option shows the flow of RNA polymerases and Ribosomes through the system as well as the dynamics of promoter states. (Not text!)
Please refer to the readme file for further information on usage.
The detailed "modelbrick" descriptions can be found in this appendix.
Spatial Model Files
The Matlab ".M" file implementing the spatial model can be found here . However it is renamed as a ".txt" file for Wiki-reasons. Please rename it to "spatial_model.m" before use!
