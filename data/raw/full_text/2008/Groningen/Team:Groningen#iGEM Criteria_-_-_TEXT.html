Medal Criteria Achieved
It's about fun... But what about the Bling?
The requirements to earn a Bronze Medal are:
Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
We had a very nice summer and we will attend the jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit a Project Summary form. We did submit a project summary.
Create and share a Description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki. You're reading it!
Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree. We will present a poster and give a presentation, come and listen!
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Parts. We created multiple devices. See our results section.
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry of Parts. We submitted DNA for several parts. It's on its way acros the ocean!
The requirements to earn a Silver Medal, in addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, are:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. We obtained results as expected with K077557 and K077126
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on the Parts or Device page via the Registry of Parts. K077557 and K077126 were characterized and we have entered this information on the Registry.
The requirements to earn a Gold Medal, in addition to the Silver Medal requirements, are any one OR more of the following:
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device that was distributed via the 2008 iGEM BioBrick Parts collection, and enter this information back on the Registry. We have used T9003 as a positive control for our experiment and these results are entered on the Registry.
Help another iGEM team by, for example, charactering a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. There was collaboration with the TUDelft iGEM team. This included two meetings with discussions and giving each other feedback about the projects. Also we exchanged BioBricks which were problematic to obtain.
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the (i) design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (ii) construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (iii) characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (iv) analysis, modeling and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or (v) sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet. For modelling we used one-to-one conversion from BioBricks to composable ‘modelbricks’ and developed a MATLAB script to automatically merge these submodels into more complex devices (see our Model Downloads ).
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation. FAIL
