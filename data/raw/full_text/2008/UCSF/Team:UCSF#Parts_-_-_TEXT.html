UCSF iGEM 2008 Parts
For complete details and sequence, see the Registry: http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2008&group=UCSF&Done=1
AarI Shuttle Vector The bulk of our parts were generated using the AarI cloning technique. If that is not your thing, we have created a shuttle vector to facilitate conversion of our parts into biobricks.
AarI--Biobrick Shuttle AB
AarI--Biobrick Shuttle BD

Project-relevant AarI Parts digestion of these plasmids with AarI will release a fragment for AarI cloning.
LexA (1-87 a.a) AB
Sir2 BD
GFP AD
Ssn8 AD
Sir3 A!D
Sir4 AD
Project-relevant Composite Parts AarI combinatorial cloning, combined with an occasional subclone, produced these composite parts.
EFFECTORS
LexA-Sir2 under a galactose-inducible promoter (Gal1P-LexA(1-87)-Sir2-Adh1t)
LexA-Sir2 under a strong constitutive promoter (Adh1P-LexA(1-87)-Sir2-Adh1t)
LexA-Sir2 under a medium constitutive promoter (Cyc1P-LexA(1-87)-Sir2-Adh1t)
Ssn8, under a strong constitutive promoter (Adh1P-Ssn8-Adh1t)
Sir3, under a strong constitutive promoter (Adh1P!-Sir3-Adh1t)
REPORTERS

3000 bp spacer construct (Cyc1P-GFP-Adh1t-3000 bp-8X LexA Ops)
AarI acceptor vectors (empty) These pRS3series vectors accept AarI digested parts between a promoter/terminator. The promoter is flanked by PspOMI/XhoI sites, and the terminator by Not1/SacI sites, in case you want to change them out.
