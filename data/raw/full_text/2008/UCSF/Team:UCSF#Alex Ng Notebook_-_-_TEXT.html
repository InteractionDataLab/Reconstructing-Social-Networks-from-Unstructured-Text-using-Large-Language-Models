From 2008.igem.org
Alex Ng’s Notebook Week one 5/27 – 5/30
• Obtained plasmids that had necessary parts for constructing the matrix
• Digested plasmids and purified the parts we needed (promoters, silencers, and reporters)
• PCRed a KPN1 flanked 8xLexA operator repeat
• Ligated and transformed all combinations of promoter/silencers and promoters/operator sites with GFP
• Ligated pAH32 with 8xLexAops
• Mini-prepped and test digested a few of the ligations and kept the ones that worked
• PCRed modifiers the high school students couldn’t get.  Using Aar1 stitch method (failed, not enough cycles)
- reran with 26 cycles (failed)
- reran with 30 cycles (most worked, verified on gel), purified the ones that did work
Week two 6/2 - 6/6
• Finished the test digestions of the mini-prepped plasmids done last week (only a couple transformations didn’t work)
- Ligated and transformed the ones that didn’t work
• TOPO cloned parts for the Aar1 stitch (modifiers)
• Mini-prepped transformations and test digested.
• PCRed the rest of the modifiers that didn’t work last week (Sir 1 5’, Sir3 3’, Sir4 5’, and Sir4 3’)
- Used different method this time. Used Phusion PCR and HiFi buffer and GC buffer. (two different reactions)
• Digested most reporter plasmids (promoter w/ 5’ or 3’ operator site and GFP) for yeast transformation.
- Transformed 8 out of 12 reporters into yeast (sv992 strain)
- The ones not transformed are: Cyc1p w/ 5’ ops and GFP, Gal10p w/ 5’ ops and GFP, Adh1p w/ 3’ ops and GFP, Gal10p w/ 3’ ops and GFP.
• Mini-prepped TOPO clones and sent for sequencing
• Digested plasmid with Kpn1 to purify Gal 80 (failed because Gal80 contains a Kpn1 site)
- Quick Change PCR of Gal 80 to delete the KPN1 site.
• Yeast transformations from earlier in the week worked except for Prm2p with 3’ops GFP
- Restreaked the ones that did work
Week three 6/9 – 6/13
• Took out yeast restreaks from last week
• DPN treated the Gal80 Kpn1 delete quick change PCR
- Transformed into bacteria after it was finished.
• Transformed 315 Adh and 315 Cyc plasmids for amplification
• Looked at sequencing for Aar1 stitch of modifiers
- All had mutations but going ahead with a select few that may be okay. (Sas3, Dot4, Sas1, and Set1)
- Digested the ones that we’re continuing with using Aar1
• Did yeast transformations
- Transformed: Cyc1p w/ 5’ ops and GFP, Gal10p w/ 5’ops and GFP, Prm2p w/ 3’ ops and GFP, Adh1p w/ 3’ ops and GFP, Gal10p w/ 3’ops and GFP
- Looked good
• Set up a block to run on FACS (reporters only)
• Digested vectors (315 cyc and 315 adh) with Aar1
- Purified and digested with Xma1
• Ran FACS
- All were done in sRaf Comp media except for the ones w/ Gal promoters. Added Gal to the ones with the Gal promoters.
- Added alpha factor to the ones with alpha factor inducible promoters (Prm2p and Fig1p)
• Digested plasmid with Kpn1 (to obtain Gal80 with the Kpn1 site delete.)
- Gel purified
• PCRed Sir1, Sir2, and Sir3
- Template was ordered from a company.
- Sir1 did not work, going to continue without it. Sir3 and Sir4 worked.
- TOPO cloned Sir3 and Sir4
• Ligated Dot4, Sas3, Set1, and Sas1 into the 315Adh and 315Cyc vectors. (Aar1 stitch)
• Ligated Gal80 into a plasmid with Cyc1p w/ 5’ ops and GFP
• Did yeast transformations
- All reporter plasmids were transformed into yeast (cb008 strain) except for the ones using Prm2p. We are continuing the project without this promoter because it is too weak.
Week four 6/16 – 6/20
• Mini-prepped sir3 and sir4
• Ran Phusion PCR for Gal80 knockout
• Sent in Sir3 and Sir4 for sequencing
• Set up for FACS
- Reporters in sv992 (left out Prm2p and Fig1p) and cb008 (left out Prm2p)
- Ran five colonies of each construct.
- The ones with Gal inducible constructs didn’t work because I grew in the wrong media (Grew in SDcomp instead of SRaf +Gal)
- Picked three colonies for each construct labeled L,M, and H.  (low, medium, and high expressers)
• Transformed Gal80 knockout PCR into yeast (sv992 strain)
- First plated on YPD, then replica plated on to NAT plates. • Transformed silencer plasmids into yeast (cb008) with Cyc1p w/ 5’ops and GFP low, medium, and high expressers and Adh1p w/ 5’ops and GFP low, medium, and high expressers. (total 60 transformations, 10 plasmids going into 6 different yeast strains)
- Retransformed the plasmids that I used for the yeast transformation to amplify.
Week five 6/23 – 6/27
• Mini-prepped cultures for plasmid amplification from last week
• Restreaked single colonies of Gal80 KO in sv992
• Streaked for single colonies for the 60 transformations done last week. (silencers into reporters with 5’ops and GFP using the Cyc1p and Adh1p promoter)
• Ran FACS for Gal inducible promoters
• Streaked single colonies from the restreaks of the 60 transformations done earlier
• Did yeast transformations (got help from Ryan, Cathy, and Jacinto)
- Transformed all silencing constructs into yeast strains with Cyc1p w/ 3’ops and GFP in cb008 and Adh1p w/ 3’ops and GFP in cb008  (low, medium, and high for both).  Total 60 transformations. (10 constructs into 6 strains)
- I accidentally threw away 20 of the transformations because I thought they didn’t work, but they were just growing slower than usual. I need to retransform th e ones I threw away.
• Ryan is taking over Sir3 and Sir4 cloning project along with 315 Adh1p Sas3, 315 Adh1p Sas1, and 315 Cyc1p Sas1
• Colony PCR checked for Gal80 KO (checked 8 colonies) (all worked)

• Restreaked yeast transformations from last week.
• Did yeast transformations
- Transformed all silencing constructs into Fig1p w/ 5’ops and GFP in cb008 and Fig1p w/ 3’ops and GFP in cb008 (total 60 transformations, Ryan helped)
• Ran FACS
- Gal1p driving 5’ops GFP in sv992 and Gal10p driving 5’ops GFP in cb008 (tested each under three different galactose conditions.  One that was forever induced with Gal, another that was induced overnight with Gal, and the last was induced in the morning with Gal.)
• Did more yeast transformations
- Did the ones that I accidentally threw away last time.
- Also put Gal80 gene with Kpn1 site delete into the Gal80 KO strain in sv992

• Ran more FACS (in tubes)
- Ran top two prospects from last FACS run.
- The two prospects were: Adh1p LexA Sir2 vs. Cyc1p w/ 5’ops with GFP (high expresser) and Adh1p LexA Sir2 vs. Adh1p w/ 3’ops with GFP (low expresser)
• Ryan did yeast transformations

- Got the same unexpected results, Ran the parent strain for control and GFP was off (no expression)
• Ran test digests to check promoter of Gal80 construct (making sure it was the right promoter) and also to check the orientation of the Gal80 gene.
