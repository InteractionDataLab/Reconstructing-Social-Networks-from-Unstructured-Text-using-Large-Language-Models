Team:UCSF/Ryan Quan Notebook
From 2008.igem.org
Subteam: Silencing
Overall Objective: The objective of the silencing team was to create yeast constructs containing different promoters driving the expression of Sir2 production and a reporter (GFP). Using these constructs, we wanted to see the minimal requirement of Sir2 production needed to silence a gene Rationale: Our main goal was to generate a response in our yeast that yielded a “poised” silencing state that could be altered by various inputs – that is, a yeast strain in which the target gene was neither silenced nor activated.
Milestones: To accomplish all of this, we first had to: 1) Create the different promoter/silencer and promoter/reporter combinations in bacteria.   2) Transform all of the possible combinations into yeast strains. 3)   Test all the yeast strains we constructed for silencing.
