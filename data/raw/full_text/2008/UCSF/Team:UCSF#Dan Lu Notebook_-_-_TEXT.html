Team:UCSF/Dan Lu Notebook
From 2008.igem.org
Week 1 (8/4/08 - 8/10/08) 1. re-streak strain with LexA-Sir2-mCherry & cyc-GFP from Alex in gal+/- plates. 2. Ran time course experiment → how long can silence persist & how fast can silence be induced
Week 2 (8/11/08 – 8/17/08) 1. time course again → compared strains with or without mCherry fused to Sir2
Week 3 (8/18/08 – 8/24/08) 1. gal2 knock-out in Alex’s strain & parent strain
Week 4 (8/25/08 – 8/31/08) 1. time course the last time… → more time points for calculating hill coefficient 2. ran FACS with gal2 KO strains, fully induced
Week ? (9/16/08 – 9/22/08) 1. gal2 KO strain different [gal] titration
Week ?? (9/23/08 – 9/29/08) 1. ran FACS with Alex's strain (gal2 KO), differeht [gal2] -> data to calculate cooperativity
