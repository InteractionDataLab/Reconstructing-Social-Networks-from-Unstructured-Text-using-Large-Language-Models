TEAM OUTPUT AKA: "TEAM DEATH"
Objective:
Connect silencing/antisilencing to two distinct biological functions (aka "memory readouts")-
1. Cellular differentiation- filamentous growth
2. "Immune response"- antimicrobial peptide secretion
Rationale:
Demonstrate the modularity of the chromatin bit
i.e. that it can be used with multiple outputs.
Demonstrate that silencing or antisilencing can initiate differentiation.
Milestones:
1. Connect silencing/antisilencing to the filamentation pathway ("differentiation"):
a. Check if deletion of DIG1 signaling leads to filamentation.
b. Demonstrate that silencing of DIG1 leads to filamentation.
2. Connect silencing/antisilencing to antimicrobial peptide secretion by yeast
a. Research literature for antibacterial peptides
b. Make sure peptides can be secreted by yeast and determine which strains are viable
c. Test yeast supernatant effects on bacterial growth
