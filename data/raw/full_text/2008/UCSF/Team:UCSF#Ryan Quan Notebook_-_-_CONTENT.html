</P><P><B>Overall Objective</B>: The objective of the silencing team was to create yeast constructs containing different promoters driving the expression of Sir2 production and a reporter (GFP). Using these constructs, we wanted to see the minimal requirement of Sir2 production needed to silence a gene
Rationale: Our main goal was to generate a response in our yeast that yielded a “poised” silencing state that could be altered by various inputs – that is, a yeast strain in which the target gene was neither silenced nor activated.
</P><P><B>Milestones</B>: To accomplish all of this, we first had to:
1)	Create the different promoter/silencer and promoter/reporter combinations in bacteria.  
2)	Transform all of the possible combinations into yeast strains.
3)   Test all the yeast strains we constructed for silencing.
