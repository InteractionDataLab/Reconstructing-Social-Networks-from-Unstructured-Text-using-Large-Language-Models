Plasmid Prep Standard Protocol
Plasmid preps are used to clean and isolate a plasmid from a liquid culture of cells. The type of prep you wish to use depends on the amount of culture you have, which determines how much DNA you will obtain.
Protocol
All of our minipreps, midipreps, and maxipreps are performed using QIAGEN kits and protocols.
QIAGEN's website can be found HERE .
