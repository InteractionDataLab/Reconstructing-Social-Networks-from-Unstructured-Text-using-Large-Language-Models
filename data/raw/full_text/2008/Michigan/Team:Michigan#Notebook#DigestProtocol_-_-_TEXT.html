Digest Standard Protocol
Digests are used to cut your DNA with restriction enzymes.
We always used buffers and enzymes from New England Biolabs, whose website can be found HERE . Their site has great tools that can be used to find compatible enzymes, determine which buffers to use and whether to use BSA or not.
Digest Protocol
1. Generally, use 20 μL for total digest volume
If linearizing a plasmid, use more than 20 μL
2. NEVER use more than 10% enzyme
Even with a 40 μL digest, you can use 1 μL of enzyme for an overnight digest
3. Add the correct buffer for your enzyme
Buffers are 10X, so use 1 μL for each 10 μL total volume
4. Check to see if your digest requires BSA
BSA is 10X, so use 1 μL for each 10 μL total volume
5. Balance of digest mixture should be your vector (DNA you wish to cut)
6. ALWAYS digest in incubator
Usually leave overnight, but at least 4 hours
Following these guidelines, your digest mixtures should look similar to these:
EXAMPLE DIGEST 1: one enzyme w/ BSA
15 μL Vector
2 μL NEBuffer 3
2 μL BSA
1 μL EcoRV
EXAMPLE DIGEST 2: one enzyme w/ no BSA
17 μL Vector
2 μL NEBuffer 1
1 μL NAE1
EXAMPLE DIGEST 3: two enzymes w/ BSA
14 μL Vector
2 μL NEBuffer BamHI
2 μL BSA
1 μL BamHI
1 μL NotI
Digest Purification Protocol
All of our digest purifications are performed using QIAGEN kits and protocols.
QIAGEN's website can be found HERE .
