NOTEBOOK
Nasir Fakhri
Most biologists will tell you that there's is the best field because they study the very science of life, but I think the physicists already figured it all out: "Maybe life is actually pointless because the universe is in constant flux and nothing will really endure..."
Hometown: Rome, Georgia
Major: Math/Biophysics/Biochemisty
Expected Graduation Date: 2010
Plans After College: eat,sleep study, exercise, continue living life as is I suppose(maybe with a few med school classes sprinkled in between)
