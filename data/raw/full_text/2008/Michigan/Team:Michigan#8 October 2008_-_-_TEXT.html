Three Weeks to Send  Parts....
Tried transforming a few BioBricks that had GFP in them; didn't get many colonies at all... - grew up cultures of those colonies and re-transformed
pTRTp midiprep didn't work; weird band lengths came out gel ; proceeding with a new strategy for our activator module:
We'll be using BBa R0010 (lac repressible promoter) and pCLOCK1 (nifHp in LeuLP) - we'll drop in NifA behind these promoters.  We'll then transfer to a landing pad (in case of the lac promoter driving NifA) and then put this piece on the chromosome.
Work done:
Digested pCLOCK1 with NdeI/SpeI, NifA with NdeI/SpeI, another NifA sample with Xba/Spe, and BBaR0010 with Spe.  Also digested BBa R0010 with Xba/Spe and our pCLOCK1 and pCLOCK2 midi-preps with EcorI/SpeI
Transformed BioBricks in XL-1 blue competent cells
Picked/Grew up Cultures of colonies we got off our plates
