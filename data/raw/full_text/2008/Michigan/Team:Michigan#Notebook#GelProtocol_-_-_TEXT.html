Analytical Gel Standard Protocol
1. Mix 5 μL of DNA with 1 μL of loading dye
2. Pour heated liquid gel (with stoppers and combs in place) according to the number of samples you have to run, and the type of gel electrophoresis apparatus you have
3. Allow gel to cool and solidify
4. Remove all stoppers and combs
5. Fill gel box with TAE until it completely covers the gel
6. Load 3-4 μL of dye/DNA mixture
7. Load ladders for comparison
8. Turn on current to ~45 V
9. Once DNA enters gel, turn up current to ~100 V
10. Allow gel to run until dye is ~3/4 of the way across the gel, depending on the size of your DNA
