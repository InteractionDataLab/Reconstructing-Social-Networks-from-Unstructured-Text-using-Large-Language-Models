The utility of threshold limitation
Much as excessive signal levels can destroy a radio transmitter, excessive genetic expression can cause damage in living systems.  While cells are usually well-equipped to modulate their own transcriptional behavior, an investigation into pathological gene expression indicates that many situations arise wherein the expected regulatory response fails.  Our device is designed to augment endogenous gene regulatory pathways.
