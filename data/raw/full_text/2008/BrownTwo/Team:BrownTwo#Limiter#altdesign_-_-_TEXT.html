Examples of Additional Control Systems
The synthetic transcriptional control system that we have added to the registry is a powerful tool, as its elements could be put together in an enormous variety of ways.  These are some possibilities that we have drawn up:
up-limiter - upregulates a gene when the expression falls below a certain level
middle-manager- a combination limiter and up-limiter, it keeps a gene's expression between two threshold levels
dual limiter - regulates two genes simultaneously based on the induction of one.
limiter device as a regulatory bridge between two pathways- the induction of one gene causes threshold regulation of another
directed evolution for transcriptional phenotypes - express a cell-death gene if the level of induction a given gene is above or below a threshold level
