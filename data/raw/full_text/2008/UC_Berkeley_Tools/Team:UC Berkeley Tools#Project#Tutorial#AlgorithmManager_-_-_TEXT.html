10)  Algorithm Manager
From the  Main Toolbar select "Algorithm Manager" from the Tools drop down  menu.  The Algorithm Manager is a  straightforward but robust tool - you take some input, select an algorithm, and  it gives you an output.  Each algorithm  has its own rules for its use, including the proper inputs and syntax.  After selecting any algorithm from the  'Algorithms' drop down box, select "Get Instructions for Algorithm" to get information on how to get it up and running.  After finding an appropriate input (whether entered manually,  imported from a file, or exported from another connection) select the "Run" button, and the output should appear in the 'Output' box.  From here you can view or save the  information in a number of different formats, graphically or textually.  The default Optimal Assembly and 2abAssembly  algorithms provide methods for optimizing the number of steps required to  create composite parts.
