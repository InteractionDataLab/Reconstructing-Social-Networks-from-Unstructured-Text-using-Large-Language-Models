3)  Sequence View I
Now that  we've got it everything looking spiffy, let's try out one of the main view of  the tool - the Sequence View.  On the  main toolbar select "Sequence View" from the View drop down menu.  This should bring up the Sequence View  window.  From here you have many options  - you can load a sequence from a GenBank or FASTA file, drag in a sequence from  another connection, copy and paste your chosen sequence, or enter it  manually.  Let's try opening a GenBank  file ( like this one , for  example).  Go to File, and select 'Load  Sequence File' - this should bring up a window allowing you to choose what file  you want to open.  Go to the directory  you saved the file to, select it, and click open (if the directory has many  files in it, you can go to the 'Files of Type' drop down menu and filter it to  only show GenBank or FASTA files).  This  will load the sequence into the current Sequence View window.  From here, you can edit the sequence or  perform a number of operations on it.   But first, let's try adding some informative highlights to this plain  text sequence.  Go to the Highlighting menu,  and select "Open Feature Library Connection".
