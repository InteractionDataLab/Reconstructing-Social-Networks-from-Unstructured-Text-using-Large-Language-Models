4)  Feature Highlighting
The  Features Library manages the local libraries of feature annotations for  sequences.  From here you can create,  load, or remove libraries, examine features from within these libraries, and  select which libraries you want to use for highlighting.  (Additionally, you can drag features from a  library into the Sequence View and place them anywhere in the sequence.)  For now, let's select default library and  hit the "Highlight" button.   Close the Feature Library and go back to the Sequence View, and you'll  see that several features have been highlighted in different colors.  If you run the mouse cursor over any of the  highlights, the name of the feature will pop-up on the info bar just above the  sequence box.  Knowing where our  features of interest are helps, but let's find some restriction sites where we  might want to cut our sequence.  Go to  the Highlighting menu, and select "Open Enzyme Library".
