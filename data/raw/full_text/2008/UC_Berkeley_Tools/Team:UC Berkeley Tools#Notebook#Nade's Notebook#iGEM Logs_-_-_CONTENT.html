I got involved in iGEM through word of my instructor. I am a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley in Bioengineering with a concentration in imaging, and I hope to apply for a PhD graduate program in the upcoming year. My prior research experience consists of working with bioengineering professor Steven Conolly in the summer and fall of 2007. Beyond imaging, my academic interests include biomechanics; signals and systems; circuit analysis; systems biology; and linear optimization.
</P><P>My primary role as a Tools Team member is to produce connections to plug into Clotho's core infrastructure; that is, to make functional tools that communicate with Clotho's &quot;command center&quot;. Clotho is a project that my post-doc, Doug Densmore, had initiated as one of his side projects. It implements his notion of Platform-Based Design, which involves the optimal interaction between the Application-space and Architecture-space of a program (see <A href="http://biocad-server.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Platform_Based_Design" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Platform Based Design</A> in more detail). This notebook will be used to document any noteworthy updates on my progress in the UCB Tools Team.

Project Clotho has been really fun so far. I finally finished (the first draft) of the help window. Hopefully for the next assignment I don't take over four days again to finish!
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:561px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">First draft of the Clotho help window.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>My bio should be finished and ready to send to Doug. Once it's up I'll post the link.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="June_11.2C_2008">June 11, 2008</SPAN></H3><P>Doug has now assigned me to work on the Features Library, Features Connection, and gave me permission to mess with the Sequence View Tools frame. Expect pictures soon.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="June_16.2C_2008:_Screenshots">June 16, 2008: Screenshots</SPAN></H3><P>Here's the first draft of the Sequence View Tools. Primitive for now, but constructed so to be easy to add buttons and connectors and such later on.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:549px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">First draft of the Clotho Sequence View Tools window.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Also ready to display is my envisioning of the Features library window. It will look very similar to the NetBeans 6.1 interface for managing Java libraries, simply because I like the customizability and sleekness of their window.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:702px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">First draft of the Clotho Features Library.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Still working on the Features Connection. Currently I'm placing priority to finish the Features Library and a new helper, ClothoFileChooser, which will, as named, act as a file chooser akin to Windows explorer. Priority was given because both were requested from Doug and Matt.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="June_19.2C_2008">June 19, 2008</SPAN></H3><P>Doug's been out this week as he gets married on Friday. This translates to many good news and a tinge of the bad.
</P><P>Good news: Doug's gets married. We get off of going to lab for a full week.
</P><P>Bad news: I've honestly been goofing off the past two days.
</P><P>
The filechoosers are all done, for now. I doubt a picture would really tell you much, 'cuz you've all probably seen a filechooser before. I'm working on fleshing out that features library now, as well as the features connection. Hopefully they'll be near done by Monday.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_1.2C_2008">July 1, 2008</SPAN></H3><P>Been a while since my last update. I've been reworking through a bunch of ClothoHelper extensions and creating a few more, like highlighting, underlining, shrinking highlights, filechoosers, highlight data storage, etc.
</P><P>I've mostly been working on file i/o with my ClothoLibraryConnection, which I'd posted before. I have also created a few new frames for &quot;new library&quot; and &quot;add feature&quot;. Once they're fully functional (and I have more time) I'll gladly post the visuals :). Oh! And I made some leaf/node graphics for my help window in the JListPane. Will also show, soon =).
</P><P>Recently also just got a camera (Canon Rebel EOS XTi!). I've been hugging it constantly for the last three days. Expect some good changes to the wiki soon :).
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_7.2C_2008:_Meet_Homer">July 7, 2008: Meet Homer</SPAN></H3><P>So perhaps those good changes to the wiki will have to wait. We're currently in some sort of coding bum rush because testing begins the 14th. So long story short: this week is going to be quite the week for me :). For now though, behold the very first real-life picture uploaded to this wiki of inarguably our best teammate -

Or Saturday. Admittedly, we set this on wobbly stone. But it'll be out, I promise :). Contain yourselves.
</P><P><I>Today</I> we met with some <A href="http://www.jbei.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JBEI</A> members and one of the developers of BioStudio. Jonathan Goler, <A href="http://www.jbei.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JBEI</A>, worked on <A href="http://web.mit.edu/jagoler/www/biojade/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BioJADE</A> and talked a bit about his current status with <A href="http://web.mit.edu/jagoler/www/biojade/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BioJADE's</A> development (he also initiated the MIT Parts registry! Wow! =O). Sarah Richardson, one of the developers of <A href="http://slam.bs.jhmi.edu/gd/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BioStudio</A>, is a genetics grad student from John Hopkins working here at Berkeley during the summer at Arkin lab. Tim, <A href="http://www.jbei.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JBEI</A>, has a fair amount experience with the Biobricks/Pobol community and hopes to set further standards for the synthetic biology community. Tim is part of the <A href="http://www.jbei.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JBEI</A> registry project. One more person had come to the meeting, but admittedly I completely forgot how to correctly pronounce his name let alone spell it, but I do know he's from <A href="http://www.jbei.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JBEI</A> (Doug, any help here?). Sorry!
</P><P>Either way, I really hope to work with Sarah and Jonathan regarding new views for Clotho. Both have very good already-implemented ideas and it would be great to incorporate them into Clotho.
</P><P><I>Tuesday</I> is Anne's day with the <A href="http://www.lpfi.org/education/smash.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">SMASH</A> kids. I might head over to Cory to get a few pictures with them.
</P><P><I>Wednesday</I> should be a normal coding day, with the exception of Zachary's for lunch with Anne and Doug. I also hope to put my foot down on Wednesday with major changes with my code.
</P><P><I>Thursday</I> is <A href="http://www.lpfi.org/education/smash.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">SMASH</A> presentation and icon making day.
</P><P><I>Friday</I> is cleaning up visuals (resizing windows, confirming working buttons, etc.) and (hopefully) releasing. 
</P><P><I>Saturday</I> is slack day.
</P><P>I'll try to get a week's worth of pictures this week. We'll see how much time coding will take from me.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_26.2C_2008:_ALPHA_VERSION_RELEASED">July 26, 2008: ALPHA VERSION RELEASED</SPAN></H3><P>We're done with the Alpha release.

If you do not see the link to the download on the above page, it is most likely because you came here way too early and Doug has not yet uploaded the release to his wiki. Plans are that it'll be uploaded by the end of Saturday. I'll keep everyone updated.

GRE's went great! I got my 800 in math, a 530 in verbal =(, and a 5.5 on essay. Now letters of recommendation left, and those are coming along pretty well. We've gone through a bunch of changes to the site and Clotho, but lately I've also been bombarded with schoolwork and societies and such. Jamboree's coming up so fast! We're working hard to ensure all of you see a great product. Watch out, MIT!
