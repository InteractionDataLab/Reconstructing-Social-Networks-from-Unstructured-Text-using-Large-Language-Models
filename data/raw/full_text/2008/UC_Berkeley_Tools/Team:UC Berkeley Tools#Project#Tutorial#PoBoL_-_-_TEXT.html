8) PoBoL
PoBoL  stands for "Provisional Biobrick Language", and represents a way to  translate different databases into one common language.  The binding file is a way of specifying  which tables and entries from the database correspond to which PoBoL data  types.  Ideally, you would be able to  download a binding file for any given database, saving you the trouble - for  our tutorial database, such a file can be found **HERE** - just copy and paste  the contents of the text file into the 'Binding Configuration' window.  If no such file existed though, you would  have to create it manually: first you would select a Table and then a Field  from the 'Database Information' box, and then a corresponding Object and Field  from the 'PoBoL fields' box, and click "Bind".  This would have to be done for all the  tables and fields you wish to use from the database.  Fortunately, you only have to create the mySQL connection and its  corresponding PoBoL binding file once.   Now click "Save/Connect", and select 'Yes' when the message  box appears.  Now Clotho is  connected!  (Note: In future uses, you  will only have to enter the user name and password and click "Connect".)
More  information on PoBoL can be found **HERE**.
