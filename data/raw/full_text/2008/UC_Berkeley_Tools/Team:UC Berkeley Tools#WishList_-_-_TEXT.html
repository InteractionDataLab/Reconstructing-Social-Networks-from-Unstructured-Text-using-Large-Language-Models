Clotho Feature Wish List
Last edited 10/29/08
A spreadsheet of features for Clotho to add is maintained here .
If you have an idea for a feature that is not listed here, please send mail to clothofeatures AT googlegroups DOT com with the following information:
Subject: Clotho Feature - <short description>
Body of the message:
Your name
Preferred method of contact
Short description of the feature (sentence for the spreadsheet)
Longer description of the feature WITH and example of how it would be used
Indicate if you would be willing to implement the feature if given access to Clotho code
If we feel your submission is legitimate, we will post it to the spreadsheet and reply to you confirming that we received your submission. Based on user feedback we will implement features for future releases. Naturally not all features can (or should) be implemented. Please keep this in mind when making a submission.
