1) The  Main Toolbar
This is  the center of Clotho: the main toolbar.   From here, you can open up any of the Clotho connections.  The connections are separated into four  categories: I/O, Tools, View, and Interfaces.  "I/O" contains the connections that link Clotho to outside resources  and databases.  "Tools" contains the connections that provide functionality to Clotho.  "Views" contains ways of viewing  and manipulating information, including sequence data.  "Interfaces" contains the  connections that provide the user a way of interfacing with data, such as  libraries of parts and feature annotations.   From here, you can also access the Start, Help, and Options menus.  For now, let's open up the options menu and  select "Preferences"
