7)  Connecting to a Database
Some of  Clotho's most interesting features can only be utilized once we've connected to  a database.  Let's try setting up a  mySQL connection: on the Main Toolbar select "PoBoL based mySQL" from  the I/O drop down menu.  This should  bring up the mySQL/PoBoL Configuration window.   The first two boxes are username and password, but don't put anything in  them just yet.  First, select the "Create New  Connection" tab,  and enter the following information:
Name:
Host:
Port:
Database:
After  you're done, click "Create" and go to the "Existing  Connections" tab.  Select the  connection you just made from the "Connection Available" drop down  menu.  In the appropriate boxes, put in  the username **USERNAME** and password **PASSWORD**.  Then click "Set as    Next, we'll setup the PoBoL binding file: click the "View PoBoL  Binding" button, and it should bring up the PoBoL Binding window.
We will be providing information to a dummy database for those that are serious about looking at Clotho further. Please contact us at: clothodevelopment AT googlegroups DOT com with the subject "Dummy Database Information Request" for more. Be sure to include your name, contact information, and a short description of why you would like access. <p>
