Welcome to Penn State iGEM 2008
What have we submitted?
Most of the parts we have submitted are from our Diaxuie Project but we have also made contributions to the registry from our other projects. From the Diauxie Project we have submitted each of the promoters we engineered, as well as those promoters followed by GFR. From our phthlate biosensor project we have submitted the human nuclear hormone receptor PPARalpha which was optimized for E. coli
