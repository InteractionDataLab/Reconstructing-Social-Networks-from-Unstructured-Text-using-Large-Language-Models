Welcome to Penn State iGEM 2008
Penn State University has participated in the International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition for four years as of 2008, and we are excited to participate once more. Our team consists of 5 undergraduate students, one visiting undergrad and one high school student who work independently, coordinated through weekly meetings with our advisers. Check out our Team Page to meet us!
Our main focus for 2008 was the elimination of diauxie in E. coli to create a xylose inducible system independent of glucose regulation. This system could be used for creating more efficient bioproduction by altering the utilization of 5 and 6 carbon sugars. Please check out the links on the left to navigate through our work.
Two other projects begun this year focus on creating biosensors that use human nuclear hormone receptors to recognize potentially harmful compounds. These receptor systems occur naturally in the human body, but our goal is to retain and utilize their functions in E. coli. The links on the left should introduce you to our thought process and progress on each of these projects, and provide a fuller introduction to the topic.
Please explore our website to find out more about us and our projects! If there are any questions or comments about the information on this site please feel free to contact us at gjt5001@psu.edu .
