Simulation
Some helpful websites for finding parameters:
Biological numbers [1]
iGEM2008 team: KULeuven's wiki website [2]
Jean, Winnie, Xiuye and Qing need to send parameters assigned on last meeting to Jiahui before Thursday.
Preparation for Jamboree
Since we accepted the invitation from Drew Endy and need to prepare for SB4.0, we have to speed up for the preparation of the presentation. Jiahui and Guangnan will present the background part and design part to us on Sep. 20 while Winnie and Jingjing, Haoyue will present the integration system and lab work we have done on Sep. 27.
Attention
Everyone should prepare their part as complete as possible, that is, we should not expect others will cover some overlapping part. If overlapping part appears, we can decide later which part should be retained.
Remember to use standard BioBrick part symbol as displayed on Registry [3] !!!
Other issues
Visa application
Qing and Jiahui's application need to be processing for 5 weeks, so everyone need to apply ASAP.
Presentation on Oct. 9th as Drew Endy's invitation
Since we need to present about our project at Jamboree, so we decide to do it as a great chance for practice!!
SB4.0 presentation
KC need to present about our project at SB4.0. Thus we need to prepare ppt for it, which should be ready before Oct. 1!!!
Communication with HKU iGEM team
HKU iGEM team asked for coorperation, so we invited them to our next general meeting on Saturday because Guangnan will present the design part of our project. It is really a good chance for two groups to share ideas and difficulties met in iGEM.
