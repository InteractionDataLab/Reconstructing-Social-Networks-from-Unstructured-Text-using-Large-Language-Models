The core circuit design
Two T7 promoters overlap each other, so that the first RNA polymerase binding event could be random. Coupling with downstream reporters, the random machine will give either 1 or 0 signal (presenting by GFP or RFP). To make the system robust, we include repressor on both left and right side. Repressor on each side will shun down the gene transcription on the other side. Therefore, once one side being turned on, it will shun down the other side.
