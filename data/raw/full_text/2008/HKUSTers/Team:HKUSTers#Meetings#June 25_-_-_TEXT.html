Proposal Writing
Combination of Randomemorizer and Chemorunner(bouncing back and forth) by Guangnan
how to modify the promoter to a mutual exclusive one (reference: Peking 07, how theirs works)
AD-BD system
BD: difficult to find suitable pairs
Chemo-runner: quorum sensing and motility control
quorum sensing, use two AHL system for two sides. When cell accumulates to certain concentration, they may expel each other. (reference: 06 Cambridge--There are many different AHL can be sensed by different species, that is, it is a species-specific molecule)
use motility control to stablize the pattern
Problems: Gradient agar plate: difficult to make?
