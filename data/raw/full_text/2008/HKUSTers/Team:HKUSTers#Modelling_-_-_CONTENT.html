</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Assumptions_.28selected.29">Assumptions (selected)</SPAN></H3><UL><LI> T7 Polymerase concentration is low and stable over time
</LI><LI> Protein degradation is insignificant in the time scale of fate-decision (the first few mRNA transcription events has a preponderant effect)
</LI><LI> Cell devision is inhibited by a DNA-replication inhibitor, so the volume of the Cell remains constant (e.g. &quot;total number&quot; represents concentration). 
</LI><LI> The expression of the Reporters of the two arms of the switch (GFP and RFP, respectively) is ideally coupled to the expression of the repressors at one-to-one ratio.

</LI><LI> a5 - probability of RepRight blockage
</LI></UL><P>(..under construction..)
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Flow_of_Events">Flow of Events</SPAN></H3><OL><LI> One T7 RNA Polymerase binds to the bidirectional promotors (one &quot;Pol-Hit&quot;), with a probability of <B>a3</B> binding to the LeftPromoter, then pauses (abortive transcription and conformational change). The time interval between 2 Pol-Hits is described by the variable &quot;Hit-interval&quot;. This parameter fluctuates above a minimum of <B>a1</B> seconds. 
</LI><LI> Polymerase proceed into the elongation state but may be blocked by a repressor sitting at the repressor binding site. i.e. at Decision Timepoint, there is a certain probability that the event is terminated at this step.
</LI><LI> If the event is not blocked, transcription is followed by translation, and the nascent repressor protein folds, diffuses and may bind to its repressor binding site (on the other arm of the switch). In one Pol-Hit event, we define a variable &quot;bindingDelay&quot; as the time between the Decision Timepoint and timepoint where the first protein transcribed from this mRNA is functionally available. This variable fluctuates above a minimum of <B>a2</B> seconds. 
</LI><LI> We assume that the average life-time of this mRNA is around one minute, so in our model, after the first repressor protein is readily diffusing in the cell, a &quot;burst&quot; of proteins (number of molecules fluctuating between 10 and 20) are subsequently generated from this mRNA at an interval of 2 seconds. 
</LI><LI> The repression at the repressor binding site is concentration dependent, which we simulate with Probability of Effective Blockage = 1-(1-Eff)^n(t), where Eff reflects the inherent efficiency of the repressor (assign parameters Eff = <B>a4</B> for the RepLeft and Eff = <B>a5</B> for the RepRight, Eff ∈(0,1)), and n(t) is the total number of available repressors at timepoint t. 
</LI><LI> This Loop of a single Pol-Hit Event ends here. As mentioned above, the next Pol-Hit occurs after a time-interval described by the variable &quot;Hit-interval&quot;(=a1+fluctuation). 
</LI><LI> For each cell, we trace 100 successive Pol-Hit Events. 200 cells in total are sampled.

</P><P>1. Our &quot;Dice&quot; - each cell - should deliver the binary output by displaying distinct red or green colour, not something yellowish...
for each cell, 
Define an output as distinct if 
</P><P>1) (# of green proteins + # of red proteins) &gt; 500 (demand sufficient strength of output)
AND
</P><P>2) r&lt;0.05 or r&gt;0.95, with r =(# of green proteins)/(# of green proteins + # of red proteins), corresponding to distinct red and distinct green, respectively
for the total pool of cells, 
Define SuccessRate = (# of distinct cells)/(total # of cells)
</P><P>2. The &quot;Dice&quot; should not be biased:

</LI></UL><P>SucRate: [0, 1], ideal: 1
Bias: [-1, 1], N/A if # of protein is 0, ideal: 0
</P><P>With the aid of more sampling and plotting(unpresented data), we can preliminary conclude that 
</P><UL><LI> the parameter a1 is the most critical one, since the Randomizer Performance heavily depends on a1 and strongly favors a larger a1. That focuses our attention on the control of T7 Polymerase during the design: a consistent low level of T7 Polymerases is desired, but too low a concentration would slow down the whole process of Random number generation, which is ineffective at best, and may even bring back adverse factors like protein degradation.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> predictably, Bias is clearly affected by a3, but it is not too sensitive - our symmetric bidirectional promoter design shall be robust enough.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Compared to a3, other parameters do not by themselves have a decisive effect on good overall performance, at least within the medium range of general parameters settings. But noticeably, when the repressor efficiency is too high, there is a tendency for the switch to be &quot;locked&quot; in both directions - meaning that the total number of proteins is consistently very low (hence low SucRate), thus impairing the robustness of the system.
