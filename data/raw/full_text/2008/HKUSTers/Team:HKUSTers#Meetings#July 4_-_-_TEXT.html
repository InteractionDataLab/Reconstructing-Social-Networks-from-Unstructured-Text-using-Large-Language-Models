Announcement
Next Wednesday, the meeting will be a progress report of our preparation work on Randomizer. Hopefully, we can order all what we need for Randomizer on Wednesday.
Contents
Randomizer
strain and vector (Winnie and Jean)
design of OR1 and OR2 (Jingjing and Qing)
reporter (xiuye)
test of cI and cI434 (Cotton?) ~ parallel to the cloning
UV test (Carmen?) ~ parallel to the cloning
simulation (Jiahui and Wisely)
measurement and observation (TBD)
Spatial Oscillator
bistable swith
motility test
chemotaxis test
Rough Schedule for Randomizer
July 4: Start
July 9: Order parts
July 16: First round of cloning starts
July 18: First round of cloning finishes, and then test randomness, trying to refine the ratio of randomness...
We may keep on trying our best to modify the ratio of randomness, to make it as 50:50.
If the first round of cloning fails, we shall start another round of cloning.
During the waiting time of cloning, we may start the construction of Spatial Oscillator.
