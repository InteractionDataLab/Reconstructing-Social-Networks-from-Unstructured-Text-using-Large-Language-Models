Taichi
by Xiuye
(plz finish this part in detail~)
Step 1: two cicle by cell swimming
Step 2: stop mobility when they meet each other and conjugate, and thus form a boundary
Step 3: change the remaining area's color by randomizer
Problems for Xiuye's Taichi Pattern
how to change color by randomizer? probably need another extracellular signal except for AHL.

Adapted from Peking U' 2007 project, we can change their circuit a little to create our desired randomizer...
