Transformer
by Qing
Original Idea: Can we make a bacterium that when put into other bacteria, it can change their properties to its own property?
To be simple, the property can be "plamid". In further step, we may change their genomic infomation.

Binomial Distribution, Gaussion Distribution, Markov Process
Read-out System
for Randomizer Project
by Jean
We can find a heterodimer that is exogeneous and can be expressed in E.coli. Applied to Guangnan's model of generating randomness by overlapping promoters, we can put monomer A and monomer B on each side of that promoter to represent outcome signal 0 and 1. Then in the second position, we put them reversely.
First Position ----Monomer A (as 0)----promoter----Monomer B (as 1)----
Second Position ----Monomer A (as 1)----promoter----Monomer B (as 0)----
Then only when we get 0 and 0 or 1 and 1 in both positions, we can have both Monomer A and Monomer B, which can be designed to give a signal.
