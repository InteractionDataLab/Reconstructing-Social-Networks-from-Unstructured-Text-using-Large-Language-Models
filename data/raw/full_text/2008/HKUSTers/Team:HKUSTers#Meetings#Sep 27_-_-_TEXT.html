Content
Lab Work
araC + T7 polymerase, RFP and GFP test ---- Winnie
total construction ---- Guangnan and Qing
Promoter testing ---- Jingjing and Cotton
left/right testing ---- Xiuye and Jean
Preparation for Jamboree
Winnie's integration system part
advantages need to emphasize
general principle: too detail
Simple protocol: too detail
Jingjing's Lab-work part
Too simple, not enough explanation
No results yet, so difficult to present at the moment
Guangnan's revised ppt
Much simpler than last time
Suitable for public
Simulation
T1 and T2 comparison is essential. T1 is the time for T7 polymerase binding to T7 promoter and start transcription. T2 is the time for repressor to be synthesized and come to the operator to carry out its activity to inhibit T7 polymerase.
