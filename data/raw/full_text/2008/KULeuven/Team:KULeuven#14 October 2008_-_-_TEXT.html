Miscellaneous
We held a meeting today and we mainly discussed the preliminary presentation. A lot of things will have to be changed - so there is still a lot of work to do.
We prepared the samples of the BioBricks that we will sent to iGEM HQ: K145001 , K145013 , K145014 , K145015 , K145150 , K145151 , K145201 , K145205 , K145279 , K145280 , K145254 , K145215 , K145273 , K145269 and K145270 .
