Practical
9-17h in labs and room 00.210 of the LBI
Present: all students (Nick and Stefanie were excused in the afternoon)
Results
(Hopefully) Final workout of the project. See the figure below.
Smaller problems, we got rid of the miRNA again and decided to go for a complete antisense LuxI. This will be part of a new memory system that will allow HSL to accumulate if and only if an input signal has been received once in the past.
We also inserted the TetR together with LuxR under control of a constitutive promotor.
Most of the the Ribosome Binding Sites have been changed to less efficient ones in order to allow modification to weaker AND stronger ones if necessary.
Pulse generator has also been redone, based upon the first system with a key and a T7 RNA polymerase. This time however, the key comes first. We hope that its half life is sufficiently short.
Modelling in CellDesigner: inverter (modified) + cell death (new), input-ouput (new), memory (new), filter (modified) + cell death (new), pulse generator (new).
A presentation has been prepared for next week to inform the advisors, instructors, students and other fanatics.
