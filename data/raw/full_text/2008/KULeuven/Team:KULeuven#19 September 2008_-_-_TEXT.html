We did one last measurement of the fluorescence of GFP and GFP-LVA. After that, we started the data analysis. In each FACS measurement the fluorescence of 10,000 cells was measured. So, we calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the fluorescence of all the cells in each measurement. The rest of the data analysis will be done tomorrow.
We made some new digests of the following parts (half of them failed though):
J23116 + B0034 -> cut with EcoR I and Spe I (succeeded).
K145201 -> cut with EcoR I and Spe I (succeeded).
J23109 + J23078 -> cut with EcoR I and Spe I (failed).
I712074 + J23078 -> cut with EcoR I and Spe I (failed).
K145275 -> cut with EcoR I and Spe I (failed).
C0062 + B0015 -> cut with EcoR I and Xba I (succeeded).
With these digests we could start some new ligations, they will be electroporated by one of our advisors next week:
(J23116+B0034)+(C0040+B0015) = K145201
(K145201)+(K145205) = K145280
(K145201)+(R0040+E0240) = K145279
(J23116+B0034)+(C0062+B0015) = K145270
