We occupied ourself in the lab with the usual stuff:
Miniprep: K145257.
Electroporation: C0062+B0015, I712074+J23078 and K145275.
Digests: K145257 was cut with EcoRI and XbaI, yesterday's digests were continued:
cut with Pst I  -> J23109, K145150+B0034 and K145013.
cut with EcoR I  -> K145272, K145013+B0015, K145001+B0015, K145254 and K145201.
PCR to test electroporations of yesterday: We had colonies of J23116+B0034 and the PCR test showed that it was ligated properly.
Ligation mix: K145014+pSB1A2, J23109+J23078, K145253+K145254, J23116+K145201, J23116+B0032+K145201 and (K145150+B0034)+C0062.
