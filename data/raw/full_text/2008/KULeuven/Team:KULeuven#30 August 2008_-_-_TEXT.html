Lab Work
Wet Lab
A glycerol stock was made of the new parts and of our own parts ( K145151 , K145001 , K145015 ). We forgot one, so a liquid culture was made of part R0053 .
We miniprepped the new parts and the two ligations that succeeded ( C0040 + B0015 and C0060 + B0015 that were plated on Ap instead of Km). They were then cut with XbaI.
The digests with XbaI were started: B0015 , B0033 , B0034 , J23066 , P0353 , P0152 , E0240 .
The ligations we made yesterday were electroporated today (still in electrocompetent Top10 cells): R0011 + B0032 , C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145001 + B0015 , K145151 + B0015 and ( R0040 + J23022 )+( J23109 + J23032 ).
Dry Lab
General
Created the oligos for the B1002 and B1006 terminators link
Modeling
Final updated model uploaded to the wiki (only MatLab)
Remarks
I don't think the dam methylation is the problem with our ligations. This is the prefix: gaattcgcggccgcttctagag. The recognition site of XbaI is in bold. There is no overlap for dam methylation (gatc).
