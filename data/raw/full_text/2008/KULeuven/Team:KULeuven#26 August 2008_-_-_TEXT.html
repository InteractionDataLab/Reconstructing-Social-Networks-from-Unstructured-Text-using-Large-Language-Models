Lab Work
Wet Lab
Looks like we've finally nailed the transduction-PCR. The photo of our gel looks very promissing, tomorrow we'll discuss it with our advisors, but we think our cells should be fine!
We cut B0015 and R0011 + F1610 with XbaI and EcoRI. There is something wrong with R0011+F1610, so we have to do this again. We can't see anything on the gel with the digests. We also had a lot of troubles with cutting F1610. We think that something might be wrong with this part.
The following parts were electroporated: K145001 + pSB1A2 and K145151 + pSB1A2 .
The ligations that were electroporated yesterday, gave colonies ( C0060 + B0015 , C0040 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145001 + B0015 and R0040 + J23022 ). We did a PCR to test these ligations. We are not sure of the ligations J23116+B0032 and R0040+J23022. The other ones seem to be OK and we made a liquid culture of them.
Dry Lab
General meeting with the team decided upon some important/emergency building-stuff :) So, here we go. The two parallel schemes for building the system:
new key-lock
old key-lock, parallel scheme
Ethics
We've started on thinking about the ethical part of our project. We would start from the film "I, Robot" and then focus further on the laws of robotics. Benjamien and Hanne did a lot of research on probiotics, ethics and genetic engineering.
Modeling
Some more stochastic stuff
