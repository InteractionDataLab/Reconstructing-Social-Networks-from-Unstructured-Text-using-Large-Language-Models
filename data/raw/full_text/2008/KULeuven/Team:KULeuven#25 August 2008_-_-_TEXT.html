Lab Work
Gel of the PCR products of the transduction
Wet Lab
We did a PCR to test the transduction with donor and acceptor as control. The PCR worked better then the previous time, but we couldn't see anything of the donor or acceptor (see picture). So we will have to do it again.
Ligations were electroporated ( C0060 + B0015 , C0040 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145001 + B0015 and R0040 + J23022 ).
The following parts were miniprepped and digested: J23116 + B0032 , R0040 + B0032 , R0084 + B0032 and R0040 + J23022 (cut with EcoRI and SpeI) and R0011 + F1610 (cut with XbaI).
The following ligations were set up: K145001 + pSB1A2 and K145151 + pSB1A2 .
Dry Lab
Modeling
Further attempts at stochastic modeling of the filter using Matlabs SSA.
Remarks
Looking for a place to stay in New York ;)
