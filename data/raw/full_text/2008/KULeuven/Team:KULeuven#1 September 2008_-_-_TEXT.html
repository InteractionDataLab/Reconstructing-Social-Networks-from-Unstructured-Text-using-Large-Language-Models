Lab Work
Wet Lab
We did a lot of PCRs today. We tried to add the second part of the UmuD tag with the 91bp-primer. We had very sharp and extremely beautiful bands, but they seemed three times too long: FAIL. This will be done again tomorrow, with primers 2.1 and 2.2. The antisense LuxI PCR resulted in a smear: FAIL again. To be done again tomorrow. We also did a PCR to test the ligations.
We miniprepped the ligations we streaked out yesterday and part R1052 and R0040 . It's the second time we miniprep R1052 and the concentrations was two times very low. The registry shows that there are a few problems with this part.
We made some digests: C0056 and C0061 with SpeI and PstI and R0040 with SpeI and EcoRI. We couldn't see R0040 on gel and C0056 seemed to be too big, only C0061 was ok. We purified C0061 and C0056.
We made a ligation of C0061 + B0015 (cut with PstI instead of EcoRI).
