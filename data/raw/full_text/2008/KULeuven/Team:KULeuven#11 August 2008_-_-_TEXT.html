Lab Work
Wet Lab
We did a PCR on the following ligations: J23109 + J23032 , I712074 + J23032 , K145015 + B0015 , R0062 + B0032 , R0084 + J23022 and C0012 + B0015 . R0084 + B0032 did not give any colonies. This is the second time. Tomorrow we are going to ligate these parts again.
We continued to construct the T7 polymerase with UmuD tag using PCR. We used the gel extract of the first PCR as a template and 1077/1079 as primers. However, it failed. After we loaded the PCR product on gel, we could only see a smear.
We electroporated the following parts: C0060 + B0015 , C0040 + B0015 and J23100 + B0032 .
We miniprepped the liquid cultures we made last week. After that, we cut C0060 , C0062 , R0040 with EcoRI and SpeI. F1610 was cut with EcoRI and B0032 was cut with XbaI.

DAY OF THE MODEL REVIEW
We found a small (but important) mistake in our model: the efficiency of the rbs for the translation of LacI was set to only 0.05 while all the other efficienties of the rbs that are incorporated in the lock3d were put on 0.167. This makes a serious difference in the final result and not in a good way: the amount of produced LuxI (and following HSL/HSL_LuxR-complex) is reduced a lot! We we're able to slightly repair this new fact by increasing the efficiency of the rbs of translation of LuxI to maximal, but this doesn't completely fix the problem. It only results in the formation of 2 to 3 molecules of ccdB in the cell which might not be lethal enough...
It seems there's been quite a big misunderstanding between mathematical modellers and biochemical modellers which has resulted in yet another mistake in the model. This time it might be more severe, because after a fast repair, the preliminary results indicate that the timer-capabilities have completely vanished...
Let's hope that the night will bring some good idea's!
Wiki
Commenced building the Homepage (in the Zandbak), primary concern is whether lending the style of the KULeuven homepage is allowed, keeping in mind the conflict we had with the logo before. We have our own custom made Google searchbox that searches through the KULeuven wiki pages.
