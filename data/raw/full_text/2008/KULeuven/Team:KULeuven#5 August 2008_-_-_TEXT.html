Lab Work
Wet Lab
The electrocompetent cells were electroporated with pUC and the parts we punched for the memory. Tomorrow we'll know if the cells are any good and if there is any DNA in the parts we've punched. If not, we should order those parts from iGEM HQ.
The plates with all the parts have been there for a month, so we made new ones. We also made a new stock of LB plates with Km and Ap.
Some restrictions were set up, but we are actually still waiting for the enzymes from Roche to arrive. J23032 and J23022 are cut overnight with XbaI. K145015 was cut with EcoR I and Spe I.
The transformations that gave colonies ( C0040 + B0015 , J23100 + B0032 , P1010 + B0015 and C0060 + B0015 ) were plated and a liquid culture was made. However, there were only few colonies on each plate and the pUC-transformation was not so efficient. The transformations that didn't gave colonies ( R0084 + B0032 and C0062 + B0015 ) were transformed again with heat shock, using the iGEM-protocol.
Some more ligations were started: E0022 + B0015 , J23109 + J23032 , I712074 + J23032 , K145015 + B0015 , K145015 + pSB1A2 (GFP-LVA) and C0062 + B0015 . They can stand overnight.
Dry Lab
General
Work on Dr. Coli logo finished! We now officially have him psychotically winking at you. The main logo has been redone (again, *sigh*) to more accurately represent the original Totem artwork. The proposal has been sent to the official people for judgement.
Modeling
Trying to create multiple cells in MatLab to model the effects of intracellularity on the timer/celldeath.
Quote of the day
David: You have to put a "stopsel" on the erlenmeyer with agar before you put it in the autoclave!
Andim: A what?
