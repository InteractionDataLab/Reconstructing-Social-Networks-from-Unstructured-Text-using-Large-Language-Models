Ligations C0060 + B0015 , C0040 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 and K145015 + B0015 were miniprepped, but were mixed up, so have to be redone. They were cut with XbaI anyway, but we couldn't see anything on the gel (??). Colonies were re-inoculated in liquid medium to grow overnight and to be miniprepped again tomorrow.
We tried to put K145001 (T7 polymerase without tag) into a vector using TOPO TA cloning. We did this because the previous attempts to put this part into a pSB1A2 vector failed.
We performed a PCR on the Klenow mix of the end-filling (part K145150 ) with primers 1129 and 1130. There were no bands, so it failed. We also tried to digest this mixture and ligate it into a pSB1A2 vector (without purifying the mixtures first). Hopefully we'll have colonies tomorrow.
We set up some ligations: J23116 + B0032 , R0040 + B0032 , R0011 + F1610 and K145151 + pSB1A2 .
