Lab Work
Wet Lab
A liquid culture was made of the new parts and the ligations we did. We will miniprep them tomorrow.
We also did a colony PCR to test yesterday's ligations. They don't seem to be correct. Well, the PCR failed - we couln't see anything on the gel (probably not enough template).
Some more digests were made and purified out of gel:
cut with XbaI and EcoRI -> B0032 .
cut with XbaI and PstI -> B0015 .
cut with SpeI and PstI -> C0012 , C0040 , C0060 , K145015 , K145001 and K145151 .
Ligations were set up: R0011 + B0032 , ( R0040 + J23022 )+( J23109 + J23032 ), C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145001 + B0015 , K145151 + B0015 .
Dry Lab
Meeting
Had another good meeting today. Possibility was raised that adenosine methylation by the dam methylase is inhibiting our XbaI GATC restrictions. Checking it out. JM109 is probably dam+ so XbaI shouldn't cut, while for example JM110 and DM1 (Invitrogen) are dam-. If we want to use XbaI we'll need dam- cells.
Edit: Dam methylation seems not to be responsible for the failure of BBa_B0015. Probably the big issue is the vector around BBa_B0015 which causes troubles. See this page.
Ethics
Ethics, bioethics and more ethics.
Modeling
Nick continued his succesful work on multicellularity in MatLab. He even created a graph that looks like the blueprints of some modern building + created bacteria that could go back in time ;)
We were also able to show the relative effect of the filter by outputting some graphs in MatLab.
Wiki
All parameters on the wiki AND in the MatLab model have been checked and should be correct.
