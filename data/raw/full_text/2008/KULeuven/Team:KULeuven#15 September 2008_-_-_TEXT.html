We wanted to test whether our GFP with LVA tag is degraded faster than a normal GFP (using FACS). But for some reason the FACS apparatus didn't detect any fluorescence in our liquid culture of GFP-LVA. The colonies on the plates, however, were still fluorescent. We will try again tomorrow.
We also did a miniprep of J23116+B0034 and we tried to digest it with SpeI and EcoRI, but the digest failed. It was the last drop of SpeI and we presume that this enzym didn't work anymore.
We had colonies on all the parts that were electroporated yesterday (but not very much). We did a PCR test to see if they were ligated correctly and it seemed to be OK (C0062+B0015, I712074+J23078 and K145275).
Apart from that, we also electroporated yesterday's ligation mixtures: K145014+pSB1A2, J23109+J23078, K145253+K145254, J23116+K145201, J23116+B0032+K145201 and (K145150+B0034)+C0062.
