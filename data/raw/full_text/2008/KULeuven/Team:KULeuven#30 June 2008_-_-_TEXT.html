present
Benjamien, Hanne, Elke, Jan, Antoine, Dries, Nick, Stefanie, Jonas, Nathalie, Liesbeth, Sigrid, Astrid, Joris, Johan, Jos, Inge
getting started
tutorials
the students prepare tutorials and present these on Monday July 7th to the team (have a look at the teaching resources below for inspiration) --> room 00.210 of the LBI from 10h to 15h, we'll go to Alma at noon
introduction to synthetic biology (goal, examples...): Benjamien, Nathalie
basic molecular biology and gene technology: Hanne, Jonas --> Results
BioBricks (how to work with them - standard cloning procedures - measurement...): Elke, Jan
modeling (what for? how? eg. Matlab simbiology etc.) + iGEM modeling (go through last years modeling parts to get an idea of iGEM modeling): Maarten, Nick
wet lab
the team will work in the CMPG labs
ensure lab guidance continuity
all students have lab coats
yet to decide how the costs will be arranged (also, do we order enzymes, disposables etc. especially for iGEM?)
dry lab
a desktop pc will be installed in room 91.13 (internet available)
Jonas and Antoine explore the possibilities of the wiki (a.o. notebook, templates (eg. digest, PCR... cfr Paris 2007 ), ...) --> Results
during iGEM, everyone is responsible for the wiki
meeting arrangements
room 91.13 of the LBI is reserved for iGEM for the whole summer holiday (not on Monday 12-13 and Thursday 12-13)--> to do: clean + writing board + check who has access - also room 00.210 is reserved till July 25th (in replacement of 00.42). This room has wireless internet.  -- Sigriddk 10:02, 9 July 2008 (UTC)
weekly meeting at Friday from 12h to 14h in room 00.42 (except August) of the LBI. You can order a sandwich by mailing to Inge before Thursday 16h. Students fill out the form by Thursday 16 (still have to put this online) - Put these in your agenda:
Friday July 18th (LBI Landbouwinstituut 00.42)
Friday July 25th (LBI 00.42)
Friday August 1st (LBI 00.42)
Friday August 8th (LBI 00.42)
Thursday August 14th (LBI 00.42)
Friday August 22nd (LBI TBA)
Friday August 29th (LBI TBA)
Friday September 5th (LBI TBA)
Friday September 12th (LBI TBA)
Friday September 19th (LBI 00.42)
summer planning
week of June 30th to July 1st = "orientation week"
prepare tutorials
assess the possibility of the project ideas
check that we're not repeating previous years' work
fill in the details of the project (interesting BioBricks to use, adapt, make...)
...
full speed iGEM from July 7th to September 19th
the project
During orientation week, the timer project (PI control of drug production and timer for cell death) and the D project (with regulator and sRNA or with stable/unstable - gfp/TEV protease) will be assessed carefully (see the brainstorm page for an overview of these ideas).
things to think about
fund raising?
contact press - which? (Hanne has connections at Het Nieuwsblad)
