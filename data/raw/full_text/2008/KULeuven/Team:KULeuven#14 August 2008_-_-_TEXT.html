Lab Work
Wet Lab
The PCR samples of the T7 polymerase with UmuD tag were put on gel. The results were not good. It is still a smear.
Some more ligation products were cut: J23109 + J23032 , C0062 + B0015 , E0022 + B0015 with XbaI and EcoRI; R0084 + J23022 , R0062 + B0032 , J23100 + B0032 with SpeI and EcoRI. Only R0062+B0032 and J23100+B0032 were not properly cut. It is possible that the ligations were not correct.
The ligations that failed were set up again: C0040 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 and C0060 + B0015 .
Dry Lab
Modeling
Nick transferred all his assets to us today. He delegated heavily and provided us with workable stuff for next week :) The wiki was also updated and remarks are all around, so a lot of work still to do.
Today, we implemented auto-activation of the Lux repressor, mimicking the original Vibrio Lux system. After a lot of messing about and a lot of long kinetic laws we finally managed it and it seems to be working correctly. It's very hard though to keep track of all the correct/changed parameters in such a large system :/
It's been said before this week, but things are looking quite good. We might have reached some sort of end point here where everything should be final. (hopefully)
Anyhow, time for a long weekend. See you on monday!
Wiki
Homepage code reformatted, and content added. Maarten made a image map of the team picture. IE fixes for tabs and picture gallery added.
