Lab Work
Wet Lab
The ligated plasmids that were transformed into TOP10 cells yesterday, didn't give any colonies. We think that maybe the transfomation is the problem. So we wanted to use electroporation to transform the cells, but we ran out of competent cells. New competent TOP10 cells are inoculated and incubated overnight in the 37°C incubator.
The ethanolprecipitation we started yesterday was continued today. After that, the parts were cut with EcoRI , put on gel and purified. P1010 , C0060 and C0062 were properly cut, I712022 wasn't. The ligation of P1010 , C0060 and C0062 , all with B0015 , was started and could continue overnight.
The primers to make GFP with LVA tag arrived today. So we did a PCR to amplify this part and to attach the prefix and suffix. GFP-LVA is now on its way to become a BioBrick (after ligation into a plasmid).
Dry Lab
General
Primers, wiki... usual stuff. Made to-do list for Jonas.
Modeling
Part one of the mathematical analysis of the memory is done: stability of the two stationary states is proven. For next week: try to find the boundary between the initial states going to one of the two stationary states.
Remarks
Sweet kisses for Rachel
