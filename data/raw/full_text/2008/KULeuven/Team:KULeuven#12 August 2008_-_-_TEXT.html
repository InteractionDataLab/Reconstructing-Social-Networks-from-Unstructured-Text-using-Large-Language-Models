Lab Work
Wet Lab
The liquid cultures of the colonies with ligation products we prepared yesterday were miniprepped today ( J23109 + J23032 , I712074 + J23032 , K145015 + B0015 , R0062 + B0032 , R0084 + J23022 and C0012 + B0015 ). After that, we did a PCR to check the ligations. The liquid cultures of parts F1610 , R0040 , J23116 and P1010 were also miniprepped.
We made electrocompetent Top10 cells and tested them with pUC.
The cells with parts C0060 + B0015 , C0040 + B0015 and J23100 + B0032 we electroporated yesterday gave colonies. They were streaked out and a liquid culture was made.
The PCR of the T7 polymerase was continued. We tried the same protocol as yesterday, but this time with a longer amplification time, but it failed again.
Some more cutting was done:
cut with EcoR I and Spe I: J23116 , K145001 , R0040 , J23109 + J23032 , I712074 + J23032 , R0084 + J23022 and R0062 + B0032 .
cut with Xba I: K145015 + B0015 , J23109 + J23032 , C0012 + B0015 , C0062 + B0015 and E0022 + B0015 .
Dry Lab
Modeling
Great news today: issues from yesterday seem to be solved! Some more inaccuracies were found, but in a mysterious way, they seem to cancel out each other in the new model. Also, we included the latest version of the memory (hopefully this time the final version) in the full model without problems.
In the afternoon the good spirit was brought back to zero by the discovery of some inconsistencies in the modeling of the T7 promotor. New research had to be done and this resulted in depressing simulation results: a background noise level which completely overwhelmed our system.
A good sleep will bring more insight and better results!
Wiki
Tabs plugin inserted after much confusion, code reformatted. Picture gallery setup. For the rest: 1011001011 and 101100001101, oh and 011001...
