Lab Work
Wet Lab
Gel 1: PCR product of K145151 and K145013
Gel 2: Digest of B0015 and F1610 with Xba I
We did some PCRs with pfx polymerase to prepare the following (new) BioBricks: K145014 (T7 polymerase with UmuD), K145013 (antisense LuxI) and K145151 (ccdB). The templates and primers used were, respectively, PCR of step 1 with 1077/1079, BBa_F1610 with 1100/1101, BBa_P1010 with 1127/1128. Only the PCR of ccdB succeeded. (see Gel 1).
We made a few digests: F1610 and B0015 were cut with EcoRI and XbaI (see Gel 2), and J23100 + B0032 and R0062 + B0032 were cut with EcoRI and SpeI.
We electroporated the following ligated parts: C0040 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 and C0060 + B0015 .
We continued ligating: J23116 + B0032 , K145001 + pSB1A2 , R0040 + B0032 , R0040 + J23022 , R0084 + B0032 , K145001 + B0015 and ( R0084 + J23022 )+( J23109 + J23032 ). This time, B0032 was first dephosphorylated.
Dry Lab
Modeling
Association and dissociation rates have been reinvestigated (HSL with LuxR), wrong values have been removed, LuxR autoactivation has been further incorporated; we've also included diffusion of HSL.
