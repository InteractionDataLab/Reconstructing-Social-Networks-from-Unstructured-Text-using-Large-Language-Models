The electroporations of yesterday were a success. A liquid culture was made from R0011 + B0032 , C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145001 + B0015 , K145151 + B0015 and ( R0040 + J23022 )+( J23109 + J23032 ).
The XbaI digests of B0015 , B0034 , J23066 , P0353 , P0152 , E0240 , C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 were checked on a gel. Only C0040+B0015 and C0060+B0015 were no succes, they should lie higher then B0015, but they didn't (but we have a spare one with the new method). The XbaI digests of B0034, B0015, J23066, P0353, P1052 and E0240 were then further cut with EcoRI and put on a gel. These parts were cut out of the gel and are in the fridge now. See Gel 1.
C0056 , R0053 , C0061 , B0014 , E0040 were cut with EcoRI and SpeI and put on a gel. Only C0056, C0061 and E0040 were a succes (B0014 is probably to small to be used as an insert). These three were cut out and are in the fridge now. See Gel 2.
Two ligations were set for the night: C0056 + B0015 , C0061 + B0015 .
Gel 1: digests with Xba I
Gel 2: digests with EcoR I and Spe I
