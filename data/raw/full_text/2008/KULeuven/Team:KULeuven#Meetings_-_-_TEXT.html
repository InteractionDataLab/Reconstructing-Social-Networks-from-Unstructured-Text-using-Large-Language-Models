Practical
Students and instructors brainstorm @ ESAT 01.57.
Present: all students, SDK, LVA, YM, JR, GG, IT.
Results
Each student presented his/her 3 favourite projects of previous iGEMs. All project brainstorm ideas are moved to the project page . There, you can add links to your favourite projects and/or upload your presentation.
The group picture is on our team page .
Vote here for the logo you like best (thanks Jonas for the logo and Benjamien for the Zandbak and Discussiepagina idea!).
To make a summer schedule, please indicate your holiday plans below (Practical stuff - Planned summer holidays). The last exam is on June 27th.
Since the engineers want to see what's going on in the lab, and the biologists/bio-engineers want to learn about modeling, we'll organize some introductory tutorials in the beginning of the summer holidays.
Put ideas and suggestions for the wiki here .
Inge will inform whether the students can stay at the Studentenwijk Arenberg during the summer holidays.
You are all welcome to join the BioSCENTer launch event (Wednesday 28th, Max Weber auditorium, Parkstraat 51). Our iGEM participation will be presented between 15.35 and 15.45.
Check out the iGEM website at BioSCENTer .
Good luck with the exams!
