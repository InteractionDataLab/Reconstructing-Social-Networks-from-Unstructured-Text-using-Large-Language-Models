Miscellaneous
We kept on working on the poster and the presentation. We're also working on the lay-out of the wiki.
We gave our advisors some extra work. They miniprepped the following parts: K145201 + K145205 , K145201 + R0040 + E0240 , C0060 + K145257 and K145270 + K145150 + E0240 . These minipreps were also sent to Korea to be sequenced.
