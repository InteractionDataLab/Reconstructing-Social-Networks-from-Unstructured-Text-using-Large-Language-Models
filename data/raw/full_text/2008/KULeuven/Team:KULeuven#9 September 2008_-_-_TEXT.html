Lab Work
Wet Lab
We MiniPrepped the ligations (K145150+E0240, R0040+P0353, E0040+B0015, K145254, K145150+B0034, K145013+pSB1A2, C0062). Then we made digests of them.
The colonies resulting from the electroporation were streaked out. K145280 colonies were not fluorescent, K145279 were. Maybe this is because of the long lifetime of GFP.
We did a PCR to test the ligations. Only K145201+K145205, K145201+R0040+E0240, R0040+B0033+C0056+B0015 seemed fine. We made a liquid culture of them.
We made a glycerolstock of some successful ligations.
Dry Lab
Modeling
Finished the MultiCell Toolbox and edited its Wiki-page .
Wiki
Last edits were conducted to the picture gallery, so it doesn't look like... well you know what, no more. Wiki finished.
Remarks
We discovered on the iGEM - Statistics page that our website is ranked n°2 in the list of Most Viewed Pages (with a n°1 place for the iGEM home page).
