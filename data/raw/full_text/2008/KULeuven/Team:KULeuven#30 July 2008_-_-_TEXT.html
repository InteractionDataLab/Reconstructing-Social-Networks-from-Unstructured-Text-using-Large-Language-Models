Lab Work
Wet Lab
Letting XbaI doing its job during the night, gave a positive outcome. These parts ( J23032 and B0015 ) were then cut with EcoRI, separated on gel and purified. Now that we had some useful digests, we could start some ligations: C0040 + B0015 , J23109 + J23032 , I712074 + J23032 and E0022 + B0015 . After the previous success of the overnight digest with XbaI, we made some new ones: J23032 , B0015 , J23022 , B0032 and F1610 .
The digest of R0084 + B0032 with EcoRI and SpeI was loaded on a gel, but no fragment of 145bp was observed. This means that the ligation probably failed.
We punched out the DNA of the new memory and checked the concentration with the nanodrop. Despite the doubtful results we did try to electroporate these parts into Top10 cells.
In the evening we prepared some liquid cultures of the following parts: C0062 , R0062 , P1010 , R0011 , C0060 , I712022 , C0012 , B0015 and F1610 . They will be miniprepped and digested tomorrow.
Dry Lab
General
Tomorrow, primers for checking the EnvZ::KmR mutation will be completed with the help of Sigrid. The Restriction Cut Sites seems not be in the same place as indicated in the Japanese paper.
Modeling
All the CellDesigner and Matlab models as the model pictures are updated. Everything is now ready for some extra simulations and a sensitivity analysis for the different models...
Wiki
We worked further on the detailed descriptions of the project. More attention will go to figures and easy reading.
New drop-down navigation bar has been posted, allowing subsubmenu's that toggle. Hacks have been added to conform with the most important browsers (IE, Mozilla, Safari). If any trouble occur, mail me (avdmeers).
Some bugs have been fixed in notebook.
Started making div stuff for homepage in case Imperial College's style is wanted.
