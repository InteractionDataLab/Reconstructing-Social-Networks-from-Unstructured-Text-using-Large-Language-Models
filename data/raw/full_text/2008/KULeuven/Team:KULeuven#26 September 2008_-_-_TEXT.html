Lab Work
Wet Lab
We came to the lab for one day and we started with some digests (cut with EcoRI and XbaI): K145201 , K145270 , C0040 + B0015 and C0062 + B0015 . These digests were then put on gel and it looked very good. The bands were cut and extracted out of the gel.
With these digests we started some ligations:
(K145201)+(K145205) = K145280
(K145201)+(R0040+E0240) = K145279
(K145270)+(K145150+E0240) = K145267
(R0040+B0033)+(C0056+B0015) = K145258
(C0062)+(K145257) = K145258
Dry Lab
We had another meeting today and we decided upon the things that still have to be done:
Send project title + abstract to iGEM HQ (Nick)
Presentation will be given by Stefanie, Jonas, Benjamien and Hanne
Presentation and poster will by made by Andim, Antoine, Dries and Jan
Check for T-shirts and sweaters to wear at the jamboree (Nick, Stefanie, Hanne)
Put an end evaluation on the wiki (Maarten)
Finishing ethics and human practice (Hanne and Benjamien)
Lab work, data analysis, documenting and sending parts to iGEM HQ (Nathalie, Elke and Stefanie)
Design primers to correct the parts that contain a wrong promoter
