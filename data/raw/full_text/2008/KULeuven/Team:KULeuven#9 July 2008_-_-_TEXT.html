Further workout concerning the project.
Big problems, we forgot one lock-key mechanism yesterday. Trying to solve the problem with a second ribolock-key failed. We now focus on a small non-coding regulatory RNA (sRNA) to use within the filter and a ribolock-key to make sure that our cells are not coded to die before we can use them. Furthermore, as the T7 RNA polymerase is -even with LVA tag- much more stable than mRNA, the old filter would not have worked anyway.
A lot of modeling tests have been performed using CellDesigner.
Advisors will be invited somewhere next week to come and have a look at the things we have up to now, so they can tell us if we screwed it up or not.
