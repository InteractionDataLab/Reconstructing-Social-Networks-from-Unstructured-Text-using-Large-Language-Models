Lab Work
Wet Lab
The ligations that were electroporated yesterday, gave a lot of colonies. One of these ligations (R0040+E0240) even resulted in fluorescent colonies. So this one definitely works (hurray!). We tried to test the other ligations with PCR, but we didn't use enough DNA.
We loaded the PCR samples of yesterday onto an agarose gel. K145150 (hybrid promoter) and K145013 (antisense LuxI) gave nice results. K145014 (T7-UmuD), however, failed again. A new PCR was set up for this BioBrick.
Some digests were set up. R0011 + B0033 , K145013 and K145015 were cut with EcoRI and SpeI, and K145001 + B0015 was cut with XbaI.
We also electroporated a few of the longer ligations (step 2). We hope they will result in fluorescent colonies tomorrow. It concerns the following ligations: (J23116+B0032)+(C0040+B0015), (R0040+B0032)+(K145015+B0015), (I712074+J23032)+(C0012+B0015), (I712074+J23032)+(C0060+B0015) and (R0040+J23022)+(J23109+J23032).
We also redid the PCR of the transduction. We will put these PCR samples on gel tomorrow.

Worked on some applied bioethics and human practice
Wiki
The dropdown can now be docked by clicking the little square in the right top corner of the screen (the blueish with a bit of white in it), which is useful if you're browsing long pages. It doesn't work in IE, but that's an error that beyond my power... for real.
Global styling has been updated, but can't be seen yet, or not anymore, as I accidentally reloaded the old global style, zoink! I'll change that tonight.
Home will be updated tomorrow so it looks better.
Future updates will include
modifying the edit box so you can have syntax highlighting
