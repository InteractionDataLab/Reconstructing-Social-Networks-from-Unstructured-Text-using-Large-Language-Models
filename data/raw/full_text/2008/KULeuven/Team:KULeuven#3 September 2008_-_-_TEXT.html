Lab Work
Wet Lab
Once again, we tried to construct some of our new parts using PCR. It concerns the BioBricks K145014 (T7 polymerase with UmuD tag), K145150 (hybrid promoter) and K145013 (antisense LuxI).
We continued yesterday's digests. C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145151 + B0015 were cut with EcoRI. They seemed alright.
We started a few ligations. This is step 2 of the ligation process, so they are a bit longer: (J23116+B0032)+(C0040+B0015), (R0040+B0032)+(K145015+B0015), (I712074+J23032)+(C0012+B0015), (I712074+J23032)+(C0060+B0015) and (R0040+J23022)+(J23109+J23032).
And finally, we also electroporated the ligations we made yesterday. Some of these ligations were electroporated into JM109 electrocompetent cells:
into TOP10  -> R0040 + B0033 , R0053 + P1052 , R0040 + J23066 , B0014 + B0033 , R0040 + E0240 , C0056 + B0015 , C0061 + B0015 - and of course pUC.
into JM109  -> C0056 + B0015 , C0061 + B0015 - and pUC.
Dry Lab
Ethics... (re)-writing sections on the wiki... LaTeX output tool for MATLAB...
Modeling
Working out how we can make MATLAB remember diffusion of HSL in the medium during the simulation. Also investigating the scale at which this diffusion happens in the simulation
Remarks
Jonathan came to visit us. He's very interested in the iGEM competition and it was his first visit to a team. We had a very interesting conversation and it was a really inspiring visit.
