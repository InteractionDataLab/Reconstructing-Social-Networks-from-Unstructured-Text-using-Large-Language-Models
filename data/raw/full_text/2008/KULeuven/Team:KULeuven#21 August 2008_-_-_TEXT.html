Lab Work
Wet Lab
Miniprep and digest of the following parts:
C0060 + B0015 , C0040 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 and K145015 + B0015 (digest with EcoRI and XbaI) -> failed.
R0040 + J23022 , R0084 + B0032 and R0084 + J23022 + J23109 + J23032 (digest with SpeI and EcoRI) -> OK.
Electroporation of the following parts: J23116 + B0032 , R0040 + B0032 , R0011 + F1610 and K145151 + pSB1A2 .
We did a PCR to test whether the transduced cells are correct (we want to see if they have the desired characteristics).
Dry Lab
General
Made a full-blown and fancy overview of the system (see below). All devices/composite parts have been redone as well and can be found in the Registry.
Modeling
Updated the CellDesigner model, we found out that the new version of CellDesigner can actually copy paste correctly, hooray! Tomorrow we might start re-testing and updating all the different devices/subcomponents, this will be stuff to put on the wiki.
We're also looking a bit at the stochastic solvers in MatLab, we'll see what we get. We might have to reshape a lot of kinetics to conform to the MassAction law shape.
