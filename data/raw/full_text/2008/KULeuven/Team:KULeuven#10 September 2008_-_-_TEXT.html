Lab Work
Wet Lab
We MiniPrepped the ligations that succeeded yesterday: K145201+K145205, K145201+R0040+E0240, R0040+B0033+C0056+B0015. Then K145258 was cut with EcoRI and SpeI.
We also made a glycerolstock of these ligations.
The digests we made yesterday were put on gel. Then we extracted them and put again 2ul on gel to estimate the concentration.
We ligated the following parts: K145201 + (R0040+P0353, C0062 (Pst) + (K145150+B0034, K145253 + K145254, (I712074+J23032) + (E0040+B0015), (B0014+B0033) + (K145151+B0015), B0015 (Pst) + (K145013+pSB1A2).
We cut B0034 and J23109+J23032 with EcoRI and XbaI.
We made a liquid culture of K145279 and K145280 to test the relation input/output with anhydrotetracycline.

Blending the ethics...
Remarks
FC André had an important match today, the final score was 8-8! We were there and it was clear our team was far better than the others! They diserved to win!!!!
