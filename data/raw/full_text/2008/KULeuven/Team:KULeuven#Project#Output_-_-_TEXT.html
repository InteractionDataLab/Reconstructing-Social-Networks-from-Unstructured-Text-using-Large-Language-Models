Output
We have been searching for an easy accessible output system, that could provide us qualitative and quantitative information in a quick and easy way. The choice for GFP was easily made.
BioBricks
Components
A GFP with a C-terminal LVA tag for rapid degradation of the protein (Andersen et al, 1998) was chosen so that we can follow the output signal quickly in time. The Tet promoter ( BBa_R0040 ) behaves as described in the Input section. For fine-tuning reasons, the RBS was chosen BBa_B0032 with a relative efficiency of 0,3.
Action
This is a very easy system. As the Input results in inactivation of the tetR repressor, there is GFP production, proportional to the input signal.
