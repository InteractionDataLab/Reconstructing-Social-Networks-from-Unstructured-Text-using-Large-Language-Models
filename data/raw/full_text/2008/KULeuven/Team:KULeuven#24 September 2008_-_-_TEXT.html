We sent some samples out last week to be sequenced. The results arrived today. We've compared these sequences with the sequences that we expect. This gave mixed results.
The following parts are shown to be good:
GFP-LVA: K145015
ccdB gene: K145151
T7 RNA polymerase (no tag): K145001
T7 RNA polymerase with UmuD tag: K145014
antisense LuxI: K145013
R0040+J23066 (Filter - part 1): K145215
Output: K145205
R0040+P0353 (test HPr): K145273
InverTimer - part 2: K145254
The following parts are not correct:
K145201 , K145279 and K145280 : Input and tests, constructs has no promoter
K145253 , K145104 , K145272 and K145251 : Reset and InverTimer, constructs contain wrong promoter
K145258 (R0040+B0033+C0056+B0015): construct does not contain R0040 or B0033
K145278 (J23109+J23032+K145001+B0015): Filter, construct does not contain K145001
The following parts were not properly sequenced (inconclusive):
Hybrid Promoter: K145150
test HPr: K145269
