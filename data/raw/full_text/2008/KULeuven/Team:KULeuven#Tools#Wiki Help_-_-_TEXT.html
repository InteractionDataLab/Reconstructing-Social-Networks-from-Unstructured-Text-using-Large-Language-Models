CSS styling (under construction)
For general styling, here are some interesting links:
W3C CSS Standard
CSS Selectors
CSS Cascading (import, inherit, ...)
W3Schools CSS tutorials
CSS Display Property (table, inline-block, block, ...)
Various centering tricks in CSS
Centering a dropdown menu (centered horizontal ul list)
Retrieving the wiki CSS files
Firefox users have a benefit when it comes to inspecting HTML source code cause of the syntax highlighting, while IE users are left with a .txt file looking source. To view the source code right click in the browser window and select
"View Page Source" for FF
"View Source" for IE
A lot of information can be retrieved by investigating the css files used on the iGEM wiki, they will be found in the head section of the html source, the url can be found at the import statements:
<head>
...
<style type="text/css">
  @import url('... url to the css file ...');
  @import url('... another url to another css file');
</style>
...
</head>
In case of the 2008 iGEM wiki the interesting CSS files are:
Igem.css
Shared.css
Wiki HTML structure
For the non-visual approach, compare css declarations with the corresponding sections in the HTML source, if you'd like a more visual approach, then I recommend the DOM Visual Inspector (Firefox only): DOM Inspector or Firebug .
Once you get to understand the wiki HTML structure, you're capable of editing the smallest details.
Navigation and Dropdown menu's
Interesting stuff:

If a dropdown menu is desired here are some good links with info on how to set it up:
Simple Dropdown menu

FAQ
Q: Do I need to put templates in the Template namespace (e.g. Template:Navigation_Menu)?
A: No, if you read this page on the Mediawiki homepage , you'll find out you can put templates simply in any namespace. For example, take we have a template located at the url ".../Team:KULeuven/Tools/A_Template" then we could include in a wiki page by typing:
{{:Team:KULeuven/Tools/A_Template}}
The only difference is that you have to put an extra colon(:) right after the two first braces({{)
Q: How come I can't upload SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), JS (Javascript) files or use add-ons that I can on other wiki's (e.g. Wikipedia)?
A: This will often require added functionality that comes in the form of extensions . Extensions need to be installed manually and you'll need access to the wiki server files, which isn't granted.
Q: I wish to use html syntax (e.g. <a>, <ul>, ...) but it doesn't work, what do I do?
A: Simply put it between <html> ... </html> tags. The wiki engine will then remove the html tags but still interpret it as html code instead of wiki code, which unevitably means that you can't add wiki code between html tags.
Q: How do I show wiki code on a page?
test
A: Put it between <nowiki> ... </nowiki> tags.
