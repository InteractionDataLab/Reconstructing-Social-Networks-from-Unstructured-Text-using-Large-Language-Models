We did a few extra measurements on the fluorescence of yesterday's cells. This way we can study the degradation of GFP over a long period of time. Still looking very good ;-)
We made a glycerol stock of some ligation products:
J23116 + B0034
K145001 + B0015
K145014
K145201
K145253 + K145254
K145257
K145272
K145278
R0011 + B0032
J23109 + J23078
R0040 + J23066 + J23109 + J23032
