1.2.2 Modeling
Lab Work
Gel 1: Test ligation with PCR. All 4 colonies of K145151+pSB1A2 ligated properly, but only the first colony of K145001+pSB1A2 ligated properly
Gel 2: Digests of B0015, C0012, C0060, K145015 and C0040
Wet Lab
The ligations with B0015 ( C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145001 + B0015 , K145151 + B0015 ) were electroporated again, but now they were plated on an ampicillin plate.
A glycerol stock was made of the succeeded ligations.
We ordered some new parts, because the modeling showed that a lot of things had to be changed. They arrived today and they were also plated.
The ligations of K145001 and K145151 with pSB1A2 were miniprepped and then we did a PCR to test the ligation (primers VF/VR-2). See Gel 1.
The digests of R0011 , R0040 + J23022 , C0062 and B0033 were put on gel and purified.
Some more digests were made, but this time we cut with SpeI, XbaI and PstI. We cut B0015 as insert (XbaI and PstI) and C0060 , K145015 , C0012 and C0040 were cut as vector (SpeI and PstI). See Gel 2.
Dry Lab
Ethics
We did some more research on bioethics and human practice.
Modeling
Great Succes: we succeeded in modeling cell-multiplication in a Matlab-environment. This will be our starting point for modeling cell division and work in a multi-cell environment! [we did what the lab couldn't do]
Parameter checking has almost reached its final state.
Simulations of the different parts has continued.
