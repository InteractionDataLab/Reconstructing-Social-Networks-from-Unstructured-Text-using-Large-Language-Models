Lab Work
Wet Lab
Stefanie, Hanne and Maarten finished the phage transduction of the cells today. This morning we couldn't see any plaques, we still went through with the protocol. Hopefully we'll have some results on Monday.
The parts that were digested yesterday were purified today. After that, the ligation was started. The two parts that failed to digest yesterday ( B0015 and I714891 ), were digested again (longer digestion time, larger volume). However, I714891 failed again.
Dry Lab
Meeting
Today we had our second weekly meeting. We decided that it would be better if we changed the output a bit. Instead of using eCFP, we can use GFP with LVA tag. It's already available in the lab, we should only add the prefix and the suffix. Sigrid and Inge will ask permission.
Modeling
At our weekly meeting, the instructors told us it would be better to (more correct to) let the HSL-LuxR-complex act as an activator for the transcription of ccdB-mRNA in stead of letting the LuxR act as a repressor. This implies that the problem we had with the cell death module can certainly be overcome. On the other hand, this means that we will have to search for the proper parameters for this reaction again, but this time without the help of Jonas :-(
We found another repressor for the memory, so even when the pulse generator would be implemented there won't be a shortage of repressors. yay!
Now we are waiting for the first results of the labteam, mainly to characterize the input...

Gene stress, Stefanie kan zich wel een week inhouden!
