Lab Work
Wet Lab
We tried to construct our parts K145150 (hybrid promoter) and K145014 (T7 polymerase with UmuD tag) using PCR. Both of them failed, but K145150 gave two bands. This is probably because we didn't purify it at first. We will do that tomorrow.
We made electrocompetent cells of the JM109 stem.
We did some more digests:
cut with SpeI and EcoRI -> R0040 , B0014 , R0053 and R1052 (R1052 failed).
cut with XbaI -> C0040 + B0015 , C0060 + B0015 , C0012 + B0015 , K145015 + B0015 , K145151 + B0015 .
We started a few ligations: R0040 + B0033 , R0053 + P1052 , R0040 + J23066 , B0014 + B0033 and R0040 + E0240 .
We also tested the ligations of 31 August using PCR. Most of them were OK. The ligations that succeeded so far can be found on the schemes below.
