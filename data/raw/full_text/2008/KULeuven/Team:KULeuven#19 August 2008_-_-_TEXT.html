Lab Work
Wet Lab
Electroporations with the following parts were performed: J23116 + B0032 , K145001 + pSB1A2 , R0040 + B0032 , R0040 + J23022 , R0084 + B0032 , K145001 + B0015 and ( R0084 + J23022 )+( J23109 + J23032 ). We also started a new ligation of K145151 with B0015 .
We started the construction of the hybrid promotor K145150 :
An end-filling reaction was performed with Klenow polymerase and primers 1129/1130. This was followed by purification, but this failed. We couldn't see anything on the gel and the nanodrop confirmed this. Neverthless, a digest was made of the product - hopefully something will show up.
We also set up a second end-filling reaction (in case the first one fails).
Dry Lab
Modeling
Still looking into the diffusion of HSL. Redone TGS2 (The Grand Scheme aka Total Genetic System) as shown below to give all the latest parts/devices. We've also looked at the parts that we still need to order.
