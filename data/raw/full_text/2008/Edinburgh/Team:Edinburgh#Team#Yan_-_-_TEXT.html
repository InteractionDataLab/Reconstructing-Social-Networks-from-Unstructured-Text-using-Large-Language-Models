Overview Step1 Step2
Zejun YAN is an undergraduate Biologist in Edinburgh University. I am interested in Biology in general, and is going to specialize in biotechnology in my honour year 2008/2009. By working on iGEM 2008 project with the rest of our team, I have alreay gained a lot in different aspects of biology. Importantly, I have got the opportunities to apply the theories I have learnt in the past 3 years to the daily work in our lab. Meanwhile, the ten-week lab working really shows me the insight of the real biology in the lab, and gives me really good lab experiences. Finally, all members of iGEM team have built good friendship by working and helping with each other through the whole summer.
I am also interested in education in general. However, my main interest in education is about the difference in education system between China and UK. I have been thinking about this since I came to UK six years ago, and also writing down some thoughts. So far, my main concern about the education is that 'always study actively', which is the key to the success!I will continue my writing on the way to my success in academic biology study.  After undergraduate, I will continue my academic study for another 4 year or so, because the more actively I sutdy, the more I can get out of it!
My hobbies are football, travelling and cooking (Although I have not been cooking last year, Because my female flatmate did all the cooking for me). Cooking has become my interest since I lived alone six years ago!
I spent most of my time in the lab and gained a lot of experiences and skills, you will see me presenting the biological parts of our iGEM 08' summer project in MIT. I am so looking forward to seeing people from different countries in the world!
