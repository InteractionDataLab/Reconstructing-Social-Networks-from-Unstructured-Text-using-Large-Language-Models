Protocols
As part of our project we developed and tested a number of procedures to make BioBrick production easier, more reliable and less hassle. These are the following:
Use of Edinbrick1 in preparation of BioBricksTM from PCR products
Site-directed mutagenesis using the MABEL protocol
BABEL: BioBrickTM assembly with blunt-ended ligation
Bacillobricks: introduction of BioBricks into Bacillus subtilis
