Overview Step1 Step2
The Team
The beautiful Darwin Building, our home for ten weeks.
Our iGEM 2008 team is a very international group comprising six students, two associate members and three instructors of British, Chinese, Jordanian, German, Indian and New Zealander nationalities. We work and study together on the top floor of Darwin Building, sweating away and becoming a family in these 10 weeks of summer. See us getting to know the other UK iGEM teams at our meeting in Edinburgh 15/16 July .
