Introduction
The rising cost of food coupled to the apparent unsustainability of the human race at its current size and with current land use and technologies makes this the perfect time to contemplate the restructuring of global agriculture. With this in mind, the Edinburgh '08 iGEM team are investigating the possibility of engineering bacteria to synthesise starch from waste biomass, either for use as a food-source or an energy-source, the latter freeing up the land currently being used for biocrops for the growth of food crops.
