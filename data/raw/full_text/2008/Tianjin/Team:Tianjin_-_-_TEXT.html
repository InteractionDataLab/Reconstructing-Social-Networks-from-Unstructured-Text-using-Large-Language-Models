Welcome to Tianjin University
 
Last year, the innovative design of genetic  bio-diode and RS flip-flop successfully brought us back a gold medal from iGEM.  And for 2008, we will come around with a synthetic convertible ecosystem and a  foolproof self-assembly                                 gene device.
 
Tianjin  University was founded as Peiyang University in 1895 as the first state founded  university in China, and In 1951,                                   after restructuring, Peiyang University was  renamed Tianjin University, and became one of the largest multidisciplinary  engineering universities in China.                             Now Tianjin  University is among the leading research  institutes  and particularly exceeds its peers in chemical engineering.
Our Project
Foolproof self-assembly system
A genetic self-assembly system was built to  reduce the labor and cost involved in gene cloning experiments. Via the  mechanism of site-specific recombination and incompatibility of plasmids, our  device could make it possible that the recombination of the genes of interest  as well as the dilution of the undesired recombinant genes will be  automatically performed by the cells, upon introducing the foreign genes.
Synthetic convertible ecosystem
A convertible ecosystem comprised of two  strains that could switch between mutualism and competition has been built. The  relationship between the two could be regulated by changing culture conditions.  By doing this, we explored the possibilities of improving the coexistent  ecosystems that function in industries.
