Project Summary
A Genetic Circuit for Directed Evolution in vivo
Directed evolution is a powerful tool for answering scientific questions or constructing novel biological systems. Here we present a simple genetic circuit for in vivo directed evolution which comprises minimal elements for random mutation and artificial selection. We engineer yeast to generate the DNA mutator hAID, an essential protein in adaptive immunity, and target it specifically to a gene of interest. The target gene will be mutated and consequently promptly evolves. By linking the expression of hAID repressor LacI and favorite gene functionality, the mutation rate inversely correlates between the functionality of the desired gene and hAID. This circuit may be adopted for in vivo evolution in eukaryotic system on genetically encoded targets. It has a variety of potential applications in academic and industrial contexts, theoretically most inter-molecular interaction that involves proteins and RNAs.

Peking University
Peking University is a comprehensive and National key university. The campus, known as "Yan Yuan"-- the gardens of Yan, is situated at the  northeast of the Haidian District at the western suburbs of Beijing. It stands near the Yuan Ming Gardens and the Summer Palace.
The university has made an effective combination of the research on important scientific  issues with the training of personnel with high level specialized knowledge and professional skill as demanded by the country's socialist modernization. It strives not only for the  simultaneous improvements in teaching and research work, but also for the promotion of  interaction and mutual promotion among various subjects.
Peking University has become a center for teaching and research and a university of the new type,  consisting  of diverse branches of learning such as pure and applied sciences, social sciences and the  humanities, and sciences of management and education. Its aim is to rank among the world's  best universities at the beginning of the next century.
