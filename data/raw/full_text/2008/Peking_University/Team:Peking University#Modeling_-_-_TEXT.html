Mathematical Analysis
Introduction
The circuit constructed in vivo in eukaryotic system plays random mutation and artificial function, which theoretically involves proteins and RNAs. However, it remains a question for the efficiency of the random mutation, or the mutation spread space over time. Here we represent a mathematical analysis to solve these problems theoretically.
Goal
Give out sequence spread space by mutation over time
Calculate for the efficiency from a specific sequence to a goal sequence over a fixed time
Details
Part 1 Mutation Model
Part 2 Genetic Circuit
Part 3 Integration of Two Models
