LB-Amp+0.2 % Glucose, (pGFPuv, pLac-Venus YFP, pLac-mCherry, pUC19)
LB-Amp, ( BBa_T9002 , BBa_K084003 )
Cultured at 37°C for 12h.
Culture
Dilute pre-cultures and add to new LB medium.
LB-Amp+0.2 % Glucose, (pGFPuv, pLac-Venus YFP, pLac-mCherry, pUC19)
LB-Amp, ( BBa_T9002 , BBa_K084003 )

Discussion Discussion
The purpose of this project is to alter the time required for expression.
By increasing the concentration of X-gal, the time required for
expression to be observable decreased, but this still takes longer than the time required when using fluorescent proteins.
Using β-gal, which uses X-gal as substrate, the time required for
output may increase because the substrate concentration decreases with time.
For the above reasons, fluorescence proteins are more suited for our purposes.
Of the fluorescent proteins, GFP and YFP fluorescence was observable at earlier stages.
But to the naked eye, GFP could be observed more easily.
Therefore, we chose GFP as our output reporter.
