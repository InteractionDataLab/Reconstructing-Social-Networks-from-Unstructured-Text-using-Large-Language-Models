About Quorum Sensing
Fig.1Quorum sensing
Quorum sensing is a cell-to-cell signaling action of bacteria. Species of Gram-Negative signaling transfer molecules (so-called autoinducer) is a series of acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). The signals are synthesized by a synthase protein(LuxI-type proteins) and once they have reached a threshold concentration,they bound to a transcriptional regulatory protein(LuxR-type proteins) to induce expression of target genes.
