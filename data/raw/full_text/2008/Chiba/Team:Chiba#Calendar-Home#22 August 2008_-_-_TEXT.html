UV irradiation test
two plasmids from
o -Ptrc-LuxR-Plux-cI-colE1-Amp-          o -PcI-GFP-p15a-Cm-(JW1908)
Incubated cultures(from Glycerol Stocks) with 2mL of LB-Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol Medium and LB-Ampicilline, Chloramphenicol and AHL100nm Medium for 12 hours at 37 degree.
moved the cultures to small plates and started UV-irradiation. (wavelength:254nm,distance from the UV lamp to the cultures were 8cm.)
After exposing both plates to UV light for 15min, 4h, 8h, or 12h, we took 20ul from each plate, diluted 105-fold, and plated 20ul of the resulting solution t (LB-Amp,Cm)(LB-Amp,cm,AHL100nM) plates.
