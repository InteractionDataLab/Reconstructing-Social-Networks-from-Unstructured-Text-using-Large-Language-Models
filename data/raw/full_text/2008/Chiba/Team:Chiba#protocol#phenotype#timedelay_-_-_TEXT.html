Time-delay check
Purpose
To Confirm that communication using non-endogenous molecules results in slower activation of receivers.
Equipments and Materials
Equipment
shaking incubator(37°C,30°C)
Innova 4200 Benchtop or Floor-Stackable Incubator Shaker(37°C)
Taitec BioShaker BR-33FM(30°C,200rpm)
46-well plate(deep well)
Fluoroskan Ascent 2.5(program:Ascent Software Version 2.6)
Beckman Allegratm X-12R Centrifuga(Beckman Coulter)
Materials
AHL(100μM) solution
E.coli Culture Containing BBa_T9002
E.coli Culture Containing plasmids you will testing
ex.) BBa_K084007 ( plac+rbs + LasI(no LVA) )
BBa_K084008 ( plac+rbs + RhlI(no LVA) )
If the plasmids you will testing are regulated by IPTG,add IPTG to the reaction culteres when you start the measurement.
Protocol
Culturing overnight (before the testing day):
Inoculate all cultures you will testing from gloycerol stocks into 2 mL of LB-ampicillin liquid medium.
Also inoculate a culture containing BBa_T9002 into 2 mL of LB-ampicillin liquid medium.
Incubate all cultures with shaking at 37°C(O/N).
Following day
cultures containing BBa_T9002
Inoculate a culture by adding 100 μL of the cultures into 40mL of LB-ampicillin medium.(in a flask).
Incubate a culture for 6-8 hours with shaking at 37°C.
Wash
Aliquote 10mL of the culture into 50 mL four 50 mL falcon tubes.
Cultures are centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 6 minutes.
Dinspense supernatant.
Add 10mL of new LB-ampicillin medium and resuspense with pipetting.
aliquote 1mL of the cultures into a 48-deep well plate(deep well).
cultures containing plasmids you will testing
Inoculate cultures by adding 12.5 μL of the cultures into 5 mL of LB-ampicillin medium.
Incubate cultures for 6-8 hours with shaking at 37°C.
Wash
Cultures are centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 6 minutes.
Dinspense supernatant.
Add 3mL of new LB-ampicillin medium and resuspense with pipetting.
repeat washing process twice.
Cultures are centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 6 minutes.
Dinspense supernatant.
Add 5 mL of new LB-ampicillin medium and resuspense with pipetting.
aliquote cultures into a 48-deep well plate(deep well).
Measurement
Mix senders culture and receiver culture(Prepare three replicate cultures).
ex.)sender culture:500μL,receiver culture:500μL
Positive control:receiver culture with 100μM AHL solution.
Negative control:receiver culture without sender culture and AHL solution.
Incubate testing cultures with shaking at 37°C.
After some intervals,aliqupte 100μL of testing cultures into a 96-well plate(shallow well).
Measure fluorescence intensity.
conditions
shaking(before measurement):On time = 1min,Off time = 10 sec,
integration time = 1000 ms
Beam width:Normal Beam
Wavelength pair = 485 nm(excitation) and 527 nm(emission)
