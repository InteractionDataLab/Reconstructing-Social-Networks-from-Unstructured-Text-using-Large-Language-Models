BBa_J22141:After inoculated for 11 hours, added 20μl IPTG and cultured one hour.
UV irradiation test  (plate phase)
two plasmids from(JW1908)
(Repressor)-Ptrc-LuxR-Plux-cI-colE1-Amp-
(Reporter)-PcI-GFP-p15a-Cm-
Inoculated (Reporter) culture from glycerol stock(-80°C freezer) in 2mL LB-Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol medium and LB-Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, 100nmAHL mediumfor 12h, at 37°C.
We diluted 105-fold, and plated 20ul of the resulting solution to (LB-Amp,Cm)(LB-Amp,cm,AHL100nM) plates each other.
We cultured for 12h at 37°C.
We iraddiated UV each plate. Wavelength:254nm,distance from the UV lamp to the cultures were 14cm.
We performed the same operations on plates following 9 or 21h of UV
exposure.
Colonies from both plates were picked and cultured in 2mL of
LB-Amp,Cm or LB-Amp, Cm, 100nMAHL for 12h at 37°C.
We diluted 105-fold, and plated 20ul of the
resulting solution to (LB-Amp,Cm)(LB-Amp,cm,AHL100nM) plates each other.
