Laboratory work
Team:Demo-Rs
17 October~
Sender Wash
Centrifuged 2 tubes containing( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))at 20°C,3600rpm for 6min and discarded supernatant.
Added 10mL LB-Amp to each tube.
Repeated wash twice.
Creating bacterial plates
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 1 (10mL) was mixed with LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml)to produce sender containing bacterialplate-1.
Lifted with nitrocellulose
Receiver( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))colony was transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and placed on each of Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908))containing bacterial plate (1~3) and Sender-absent negative control plate (t=0). Determined the time required for the colonies to fluoresce depending on the bacterial concentration (100 and 1000-fold dilution).
Method to detect fluorescence
Plates cultured at 37°C were exposed to UV (312nm) light once every 30 minutes to observe GFP fluorescence.
