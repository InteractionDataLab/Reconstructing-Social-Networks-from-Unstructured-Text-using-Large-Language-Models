Reporter
Our delayed switch has to turn on or off without variable time lag after the preset time has passed. Therefore we need the output module, which announces quickly that a particular concentration of the signaling molcules has been reached.
We imagined three kinds of output:
Fluorescent Protein
Bioluminescence(luciferase)
Cell staining (LacZ and X-gal assay)
and tested Fluorescent Protein and β-gal(lacZ).
We selected GFP, Venus YFP, and mCherry. The latter two were chosen because Venus YFP matures quickly (1) ,and we can easibly recognize mCherry coloration (2) .
We used fluorescent proteins and β-gal(lacZ) as a reporter.
We were able to recognize chemical luminescence of luciferase only at dark place devoid of light. Therefore the conditions of use are limited, and we did not select Luciferase as our reporter.
Experiment
Measure the time course form adding inducer (IPTG or AHL) to confirm the change of color to analysis the gene expression.
Evaluate following gene:
Fluorescent Protein
GFP
pGFPuv
BBa_T9002
Venus YFP
BBa_K084003
pLac-Venus YFP
mCherry
pLac-mCherry
β-gal (X-gal assay)
pUC19(plac-LacZα)
Fluorescent Protein
GFP
pGFPuv
BBa_T9002
Venus YFP
BBa_K084003
pLac-Venus YFP
mCherry
pLac-mCherry
β-gal (X-gal assay)
pUC19(plac-LacZα)
Result & Discussion
Result LacZ
Table  1 Dependent on X-gal concentration.
LacZ, which is not fluorescent, was observed under the naked eye.
Time required for observation of LacZ staining depended on X-gal concentration.
We were not able to observe stainig at a liquid state within 4 hours.-->Staining was observed at the 8 hour point.
Fluorescent protein
Table  2 Result of Time chase.
Similar results were obtained for liquid and solid cultures.
To the naked eye, fluorescence was observed most easily in the order mCherry, GFP, and YFP.
The solid state cultures were easier to observe to the naked eye.
AHL induction took a shorter time than IPTG for fluorescence to be observable.
GFP and YFP showed observable fluorescence earlier than mCherry.

Discussion Discussion
The purpose of this project is to alter the time required for expression.
By increasing the concentration of X-gal, the time required for
expression to be observable decreased, but this still takes longer than the time required when using fluorescent proteins.
Using β-gal, which uses X-gal as substrate, the time required for
output may increase because the substrate concentration decreases with time.
For the above reasons, fluorescence proteins are more suited for our purposes.
Of the fluorescent proteins, GFP and YFP fluorescence was observable at earlier stages.
But to the naked eye, GFP could be observed more easily.
Therefore, we chose GFP as our output reporter.
