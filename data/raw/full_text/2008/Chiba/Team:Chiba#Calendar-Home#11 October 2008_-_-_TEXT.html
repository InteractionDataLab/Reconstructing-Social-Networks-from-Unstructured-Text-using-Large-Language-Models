Laboratory work
Team:Demo-Rs
~10 October
Sender Wash
Centrifuged 2 tubes containing( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))at 20°C,3600rpm for 6min and discarded supernatant.
Added 10mL LB-Amp to each tube.
Repeated wash twice.
Creating bacterial plates
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube(10mL) was mixed with LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml)to produce sender containing bacterialplate.
Lifted with nitrocellulose
Receiver( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))colony was transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and placed on each of Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908))containing bacterial plate and Sender-absent negative control plate (t=0).
Method to detect fluorescence
Plates cultured at 37°C were exposed to UV (312nm) light once every 30 minutes to observe GFP fluorescence.
