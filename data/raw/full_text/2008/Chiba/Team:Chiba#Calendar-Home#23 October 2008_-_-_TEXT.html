Varying bacterial numbers
Receiver(T9002) pre-incubation
Receiver: BBa_T9002 (JW1908)wascultured in 2mL LB-Amp (37°C,12h)
Pre-incubated Receiver( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))was plated so as to produce about 1000 colonies.
Sender(S03623) pre-incubation
Sender: BBa_S03623 (JW1908) was cultured in 50mL  entrifuge tubes in 10mL of LB-Amp (37°C,12h)(2 tubes)
Sender Wash
Centrifuged 2 tubes containing( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))at 20°C,3600rpm for 6min and discarded supernatant.
Added 10mL LB-Amp to each tube.
Repeated wash twice.
Creating bacterial plates
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 1 (10mL) was mixed with LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml)to produce sender containing bacterialplate-1.
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 2(100μl)was mixed with LB-Amp(9.9ml) and diluted 100-fold. 10ml of this solution was mixed with LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml) and created Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908))containing bacterial plate-2.
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender solution-2(10μl) and LB-Amp(9.99ml)was mixed to dilute 1000-fold.10ml of this solution and LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml) was mixed to create Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908) containing bacterial plate-3
Lifted with nitrocellulose
Receiver( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))colony was transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and placed on each of Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908))containing bacterial plate (1~3) and Sender-absent negative control plate (t=0). Determined the time required for the colonies to fluoresce depending on the bacterial concentration (100 and 1000-fold dilution).
Method to detect fluorescence
Plates cultured at 37°C were exposed to UV (312nm) light once every 30 minutes to observe GFP fluorescence.

Testing different receivers
Receiver&sender pre-culture
Used Receivers were:
BBa_T9002 :ptet-luxR-plux-GFP(high copy)
ptet-luxR-(low copy), BBa_J37032 :plux-GFP(high copy)
BBa_T9002 :ptet-luxR-plux-GFP(low copy)
ptet-mLuxR(too sensitive)-plux-GFP
ptet-luxR-plux-GFP-plac-aiiA
（all JW1908）Each was cultured in 2ml LB (37°C,12h) and plated so that about 1000 colonies of receiver cells will grow.
Sender: BBa_S03623 (JW1908) was cultured in 10mL LB in 50mL centrifuge tubes (37°C,12h)
sender wash
Each receiver-containing medium was centrifuged in 50mL tubes at de20°C, 3600rpm for 6min and supernatant discarded.
Added 10mL LB to each tube.
Repeated wash twice.
Creating bacterial plates
LB pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 1 (10mL) was mixed with LB-agar(50°C)(10ml)to produce sender containing bacterial plate-1.
LB pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 2(100μl)was mixed with LB(9.9ml) and diluted 100-fold. 10ml of this solution was mixed with LB-agar(50°C)(10ml) and created Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) containing bacterial plate-2.

Lifted with nitrocellulose
Each Receiver colony was transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and placed on a Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) containing bacterial plate (1~3) or a sender-absent negative control plate(t=0) to observe how receiver type affects the time taken for the colonies to display visible fluorescence.
Method to detect fluorescence
Plates cultured at 37°C were exposed to UV (312nm) light once every 30 minutes to observe GFP fluorescence.
