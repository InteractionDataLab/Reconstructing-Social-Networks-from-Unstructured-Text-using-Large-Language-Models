Demo Experiment ~Receivers~
Varying bacterial numbers: method
Receiver(T9002) pre-incubation
Receiver: BBa_T9002 (JW1908)wascultured in 2mL LB-Amp (37°C,12h)
Pre-incubated Receiver( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))was plated so as to produce about 1000 colonies.
Sender(S03623) pre-incubation
Sender: BBa_S03623 (JW1908) was cultured in 50mL  entrifuge tubes in 10mL of LB-Amp (37°C,12h)(2 tubes)
Sender Wash
Centrifuged 2 tubes containing( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))at 20°C,3600rpm for 6min and discarded supernatant.
Added 10mL LB-Amp to each tube.
Repeated wash twice.
Creating bacterial plates
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 1 (10mL) was mixed with LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml)to produce sender containing bacterialplate-1.
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 2(100μl)was mixed with LB-Amp(9.9ml) and diluted 100-fold. 10ml of this solution was mixed with LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml) and created Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908))containing bacterial plate-2.
LB-Amp pre-cultured Sender solution-2(10μl) and LB-Amp(9.99ml)was mixed to dilute 1000-fold.10ml of this solution and LB-Amp-agar(50°C)(10ml) was mixed to create Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908) containing bacterial plate-3
Lifted with nitrocellulose
Receiver( BBa_T9002 (JW1908))colony was transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and placed on each of Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908))containing bacterial plate (1~3) and Sender-absent negative control plate (t=0). Determined the time required for the colonies to fluoresce depending on the bacterial concentration (100 and 1000-fold dilution).
Method to detect fluorescence
Plates cultured at 37°C were exposed to UV (312nm) light once every 30 minutes to observe GFP fluorescence.
Testing different receivers-methods
Receiver&sender pre-culture
Used Receivers were:
BBa_T9002 :ptet-luxR-plux-GFP(high copy)
ptet-luxR-(low copy), BBa_J37032 :plux-GFP(high copy)
BBa_T9002 :ptet-luxR-plux-GFP(low copy)
ptet-mLuxR(too sensitive)-plux-GFP
ptet-luxR-plux-GFP-plac-aiiA
（all JW1908）Each was cultured in 2ml LB (37°C,12h) and plated so that about 1000 colonies of receiver cells will grow.
Sender: BBa_S03623 (JW1908) was cultured in 10mL LB in 50mL centrifuge tubes (37°C,12h)
sender wash
Each receiver-containing medium was centrifuged in 50mL tubes at de20°C, 3600rpm for 6min and supernatant discarded.
Added 10mL LB to each tube.
Repeated wash twice.
Creating bacterial plates
LB pre-cultured Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) tube 1 (10mL) was mixed with LB-agar(50°C)(10ml)to produce sender containing bacterial plate-1.

Lifted with nitrocellulose
Each Receiver colony was transfered to a nitrocellulose filter and placed on a Sender( BBa_S03623 (JW1908)) containing bacterial plate (1~3) or a sender-absent negative control plate(t=0) to observe how receiver type affects the time taken for the colonies to display visible fluorescence.
Method to detect fluorescence
Plates cultured at 37°C were exposed to UV (312nm) light once every 30 minutes to observe GFP fluorescence.

discussion
We demonstrated that the GFP expression switch is delayed by the ratio of sender to receiver.
The result indicates that the amount of AHL from one bacterium per time is constant and independent of bacteria number density.
This is probaly because the sender has no feedback circuit of AHL production.
Although this strategy can not change the time interval, we can manage the switch timing by changing the ratio of sender to receiver.

discussion
Number 2,3 and 5 fluoresces in 30 min. We could not see time difference of these, it may be resulted from excess amount of sender bacteria.
Precise experiments controlling the number of sender are necessary for further discussion.
In comparizon with number 2 (T9002:high copy), there was no change of fluorescence intensity of number 4 (T9002:low copy) in 4 hours.
It is probably because of circuit working, since the AHL is provided enough for the receiver.
