Design
Each species has their own LuxI-type proteins,which synthesize their specific autoinducers,AHLs.AHLs produced by different LuxI-type proteins differ only in the length of the acyl-chain moiety and substitution at position C-3.LuxR,which is original for Vibrio fischeri,is activated by its cognate autoinducer,3OC6HSL.However,LuxR is also activated by non-endogenous molecules,C4HSL,C6HSL,and 3OC12HSL.Activation by non-endogenous molecules requires a higher signal concentration(2).This results in slower activation of receivers,when AHL concentration is increasing.
