Experiment
To characterize quorum sensing crosstalk, constitutive AHL senders were mixed with constitutive receivers and measure fluorescence intensity.
Transformed Senders into E.coli strains(XL10GOLD or JW1908) and Receiver into E.coli strain(JW1908).
Inoculated them independently in liquid media. Incubated at 37°C 12h
Mixed them.
Incubated at 30°C.
Measured intensity of green fluorescence at regular time intervals.
crosstalk experients at various conditions.
E.Coli strain JW1908 or XL10Gold.
Reaction Temparature 37 or 30.
Cell number.
