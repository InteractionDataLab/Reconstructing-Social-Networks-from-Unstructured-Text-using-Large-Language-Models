Time Delay Test
Designs
In this plan, we induce cross-talk of quorum sensing by changing receiver protein.
Expetriments
sender
AHL sender(BBa_S03623)
reciever
LuxR
RhlR(BBa_K084004)
LasR(BBa_K084005)
CinR(BBa_K084006)
reporter
Plux-GFP(BBa_J37032)
Method
Transformed Sender into E.coli strains(JW1908) and Receivers into E.coli strain(JW1908).
Inoculated them independently in liquid media. Incubated at 37c° 12h.
Inoculated again at 37c° upto about OD600=2.0
Washed them.
Mixed them (Sender:Receiver=1000μl:1000μl).
Incubated at 30c°.
Measured intensity of green fluorescence at regular time intervals.
