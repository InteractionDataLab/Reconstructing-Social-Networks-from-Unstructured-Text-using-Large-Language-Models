Laboratory work
Team:Demo-Is
Pre-culture
Picked and cultured the following glycerol stocks in 2mL of LB:
LB-Amp, BBa_T9002 , (JW1908)
LB-Amp+0.2%Glu, BBa_K084012 ( plac+rbs + LuxI(no LVA) ), (XL10G)
LB-Amp+0.2%Glu, BBa_K084007 ( plac+rbs + LasI(no LVA) ), (XL10G)
Cultured at 37°C for 12h.
Culture
Added 6.25% each of the pre-cultures to new LB medium.
LB-Amp, BBa_T9002
LB-Amp+0.2%Glu, BBa_K084012 ( plac+rbs + LuxI(no LVA) ), BBa_K084007 ( plac+rbs + LasI(no LVA) )
Cultured at 37°C for 4~5h
Wash
Transfer 10mL each of the culture to 50mL centrifuge tubes.
Centrifuged for 6min at 3600rpm,20°C and discarded the supernatant.
Added LB-Amp to each centrifuge tube:
10mL to the tube that contains BBa_T9002
5mL to the tube that contains BBa_K084012 , BBa_K084007
Centrifuged for 6min, 3600rpm at 20°C the tube containing BBa_K084012 , BBa_K084007 and discarded the supernatant.
10mL to the tube that contains BBa_K084012 , BBa_K084007
Centrifuged for 6min, 3600rpm at 20°C the tube containing BBa_K084012 , BBa_K084007 and discarded the supernatant.
5mL to the tube that contains BBa_K084012 , BBa_K084007
Mix
Mixed the sender cells BBa_K084012 and BBa_K084007 both with BBa_T9002 at a 1:1 ratio.
Added 100μL each to a 96-well shallow plate (as shown in the figure).
Green part is BBa_K084012 : BBa_T9002 =1:1
Red part is BBa_K084007 : BBa_T9002 =1:1
Uncolored part is BBa_T9002 alone.
Culture and observe results
Results
Green region: sender=LuxI, Red circular region: sender=Las I.
0 h
4 h
(Lux I GFP detected)
8 h
(Lux I GFP and Las I GFP detected)
LuxI GFP is detected at 4h following mixing while LasI GFP is detected after 8h, thus successfully demonstrating time-delay depending on the sender used.
