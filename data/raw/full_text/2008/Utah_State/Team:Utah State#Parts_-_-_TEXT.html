BIOBRICKS
Nine BioBricks were planned as extracts from the PHB operon.  Five of these were from the PHB promoter and four were from the CAB gene cassette.
SUBMITTED BIOBRICKS
Three PHB promoter BioBricks were successfully ligated into the pSB1A3 plasmid.  These BioBricks were constructed to be tested as promoters for green fluorescent protein to determine their autonomy and effectiveness. These BioBricks are labeled in the BioBrick registry as BBa_K089004, BBa_K089005, and BBa_K089006.
Miniprepped plasmid DNA from each of the BioBricks were placed into PCR tubes and labeled with their designated BioBrick number.  These were placed in a 50-ml free-standing centrifuge tube and sent to iGEM for further testing and placement in the registry.
BIOBRICKS IN PROGRESS
The two remaining PHB promoter regions have been successfully amplified using PCR and are in process of ligations and transformations.
Two of the CAB cassette genes, phaA and phaB, have been successfully amplified using PCR and are in process of ligation and transformation.  The phaC and phaCAB sequences are in earlier stages.
