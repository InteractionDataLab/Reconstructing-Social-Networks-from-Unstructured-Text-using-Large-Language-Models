Team Toxipop did extensive research in April and May once our project was decided.  Our research extended throughout the summer as different problems and ideas presented themselves.  The following papers guided us throughout the process.  They include information about the Cell Lysis Cassette and the individual genes that make up the composite part.  We also looked into previous water toxin detection systems.  This included looking at current products on the market as well as scientific literature that provided valuable information about different reporting systems.
