Threshold Regulation
Threshold limitation
In the early days of radio, AM transmitters were vulnerable to overload by an input signal of too great a magnitude.  To protect the transmitter from damage, a limiter circuit was employed to attenuate signal peaks while allowing all subthreshold signal to pass through unchanged.  We have designed a genetic circuit that behaves similarly.  Our gene network reacts to the level of transcription of a gene of interest, limiting it to levels above or below a user-defined threshold.  In our proof-of-concept, we use synthetic transcription factors to limit the expression of an inducible reporter.  In practice, these modular transcription factors can be used to regulate any endogenous gene with a known promoter and transcription factor DNA-binding domain.  Extremes of gene expression can damage living systems, while normal expression is healthy.  Our limiter could react to the level of a gene's expression within individual cells, correcting problems only where and when they occur.
