Our research crewe would like to extend enormous thanks to the following individuals:
At Large:
Caroline Ajo-Franklin , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory:  for providing us with the initial inspiration to implement our system in yeast, for providing us with dozens of plasmids encoding the synthetic transcriptional control system, and for continuing advice in yeast techniques.
David Drubin, Harvard University: for the provision of additional yeast plasmids
Christina Smolke, Caltech: for conferring upon us a key component for generating knockouts in yeast
At Brown:
Richard Bennett :     for help in developing our yeast genomic integration strategy as well as use of his lab facilities.
Jeff Laney :      for yeast techniques and vectors
Suzanne Sindi: modeling
Patrick: yeast imaging
Geoffrey Williams: confocal fluorescence microscopy
Robbert Creton: microscopy and quantification of fluorescence
Lulu Tsai: Competent cells protocol and assistance
Our work would not have been possible without the generous support of the following organizations:
