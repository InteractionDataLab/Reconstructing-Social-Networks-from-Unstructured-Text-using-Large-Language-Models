Lab Notebook
The Brown iGEM Lab is student-run and consists of five undergraduates. This year, the team split up to work on two projects. We begin our training in the Spring semester with a lab class in Synthetic Biology.  With the gracious support of the UTRA Program, Research at Brown, and several academic departments, we were given the opportunity to pursue our own ideas over the summer.  With the guidance of graduate mentors, faculty advisors, and synthetic biologists nationwide, our lab has split our efforts to pursue two distinct projects- one an electrical reporting system, and the other a threshold regulation network.  This is the latter.
