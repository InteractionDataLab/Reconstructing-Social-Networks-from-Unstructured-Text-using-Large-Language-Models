iGEM 2008
The Brown iGEM Lab is student-run and consists of five undergraduates. This year, the team split up to work on two projects. We begin our training in the Spring semester with a lab class in Synthetic Biology.  With the gracious support of the UTRA Program and various departments, we work throughout the summer on our projects.  With the guidance of graduate mentors and faculty advisers across a multitude of departments, our lab is currently working on two such ventures--one a novel electrical reporting system and the other a novel threshold switch. In the spirit of Synthetic Biology, our team's project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering, electrochemistry, genetics, and microbiology.
