Team:Brown/Presentations
From 2008.igem.org
Team Resistance presented its work at the UTRA Poster Symposium on Friday, August 1, 2008.  It was a great experience sharing our work with the rest of the science community at Brown, professors and students alike.  It also promoted IGEM and the new field of Synthetic Biology.
Team Resistance will be presenting our final poster and presentation on Monday, November 3, 2008 to the Synthetic Biological Systems class taught by our Faculty Mentor, Gary Wessel.
