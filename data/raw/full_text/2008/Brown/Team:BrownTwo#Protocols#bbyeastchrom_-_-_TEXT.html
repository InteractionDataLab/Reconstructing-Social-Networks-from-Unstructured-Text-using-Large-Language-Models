Moving Biobrick Constructs onto Yeast Chromosomes
A New Standard for Biobrick Construction
The Registry  includes a growing number of parts for use in yeast, but there currently exist  no BBa compatible yeast shuttle vectors.   In our work, we have chosen to utilize Sikorski yeast vectors to  integrate BBa parts into yeast chromosomes.   [1]   With genomic insertion, each  transformation is stable, being reproduced with the rest of the  chromosome.  Additionally, exactly one  copy of each insertion is present in transformed strains, allowing for precise  control of the relative expression levels of multiple elements.   The Sikorski vectors can be transformed into  E. coli for construction and propagation.   There exist four integrative vectors in the pRS30x family, each  integrating at a different auxotrophic locus and containing the amino acid  synthesis gene to fill that auxotrophy as a marker for integration.   The vectors are not suitable for Biobrick construction- they each contain one extraneous Biobrick site, and lack the standard cloning site.  Thankfully, there is a standard method for cloning BBa parts onto the pRS30x vectors for yeast chromosomal  integration: [2]
Digest the BBa vector containing the finished construct and pRS30x vector of choice using the following enzymes:
Sikorski    vector (marker)
insert & vector digest
pRS303 (HIS3)
EcoRI, SpeI
pRS304* (TRP1)
EcoRI, SpeI
pRS305 (LEU2)
XbaI, PstI
pRS306 (URA3)
EcoRI, SpeI
Alternatively,  the final BBa construction ligation can be done as a double insertion onto a  pRS30x vector.  We did all of our pRS vector insertions this way.  The three-way ligations work well consistently, and many variations (e.g. combination of promoters and coding regions) can be generated with relative ease:
Sikorski    vector
vector digest
forward part    digest
back part    digest
pRS303 (HIS3)
EcoRI, Not I
EcoRI, SpeI
XbaI, NotI
pRS304*    (TRP1)
EcoRI, Not I
EcoRI, SpeI
XbaI, NotI
pRS305 (LEU2)
NotI, SpeI
NotI, PstI
XbaI, PstI
pRS306 (URA3)
EcoRI, Not I
EcoRI, SpeI
XbaI, NotI
(Note: The orientation        of the BioBrick part should be opposite that of the auxotropic gene once        incorporated into the Sikorski vector.)
Ligate the insert and vector  using standard techniques and transform into E. coli
Miniprep the vector from the  transformed strain
Linearize ~1 microgram of the  vector per transformation using the appropriate enzyme according to the  following table:
 
Vector
Marker

pRS303
HIS3
PstI
pRS304*
TRP1
PstI
pRS305
LEU2
BstEII
pRS306
URA3
PstI
Heat-kill and/or purify the digest
Transform the linear construct into a haploid strain with the correct auxotrophies (His, Trp, Leu, Ura- we used W303) using a standard lithium acetate procedure.   We have gotten good results from the following:

Select for transformants by plating the transformation on a synthetic defined (SD) plate with amino acid dropouts for whatever gene is encoded on the vector you transformed.  Double integrations (integrating two constructs at ones) worked very reliably for us, and triple integrations worked about half the time.  If you need to integrate more than four constructs, you can transform up to three into each haploid mating type (a and alpha), then mate them to yield a diploid strain with all of your constructs.  Use complementary selection markers (e.g. His, Trp, Leu in type a and Trp, Leu, Ura in type alpha) so you can plate the mixed cells on SD-His-Trp-Leu-Ura and select for cells that have mated, and thus have all of your constructs in their genome.
