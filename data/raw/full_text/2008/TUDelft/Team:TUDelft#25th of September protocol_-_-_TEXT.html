25th of September Luciferase assay protocol
This protocol has been discarded due to interfering of Promega lysis buffer with the protein measurements.
Cell preparation
Pellet 1 ml of grown culture when the culture is around 0.6 by centrifuging 5 min at 10000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge.
Lyse the cells by adding 1x lysis buffer from the Renilla Luciferase Assay kit.
Freeze the cells at -20 until measurements will be done.
Measurements
Mix 1 ul of 100X luciferase substrate in 100 ul of assay buffer per sample in the luminometer's reagent tube no. 1
Put 20 ul of lysed cells in a white 96 wells plate.
Put the prime plate in the luminometer (usually on top)
Put the tube with assay buffer under reagent needle no. 1, make sure the tip of the needle is in a position to reach all the assay buffer.
Prime the luminometer with 1000 ul assay buffer in the priming plate(make sure the tubing is rinsed before)
Measure luciferase activity by:
Adding 100 ul of assay buffer to a well
Wait 2 seconds
Integrate luminescence for 10 seconds.
Repeat for every well
There is a standard protocol on the computer in which you only have to indicate the wells to be assayed.
Purge the tubing (Assay buffer can be stored and frozen for short periods (1 week at most) according to the technical manual)
Rinse the tubing with 5000 ul of ethanol, and purge it.
Rinse the tubing with 5000 ul of H2O, and purge it.
The tubing and injector should be clean and empty now.
