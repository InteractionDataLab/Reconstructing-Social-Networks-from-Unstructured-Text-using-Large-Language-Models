Below are the DNA-gels which contain the final constructs we've sent in for sequencing and to MIT. Theoretical sizes including the biobrick PCR DNA (316 basepairs) is included in the subscripts.
Figure 1. Gel containing the final construct of K115012 (1564 bp), indicated by the arrow.
Figure 2. Gel containing the final construct of K115029 (1648 bp) & K115031 (1661 bp), both indicated by the arrow.
Figure 3. Gel containing the final construct of K115030 (1604 bp), indicated by lane labeled K115030 - 3.
Figure 4. Gel containing the final construct of K115032 (1648 bp) & K115036 (1578 bp). For K115032 the lane labeled 1' was used and for K115036 the lane labeled A.
Figure 5. Gel containing the final construct of K115033 (1604 bp) indicated by lane labeled K115033 - 6.
Figure 6. Gel containing the final construct of K115034 (1635 bp), indicated by the arrow.
Figure 7. Gel containing the final construct of K115035 (1635 bp), indicated by lane 1.
