Openwetware
our openwetware wiki - If more info is obtained after the wiki freezing, it will be posted here.
iGEM
iGEM projects - categorized list with all iGEM projects
Idea exchange - some ideas posted by other teams
Introductory resources on the iGEM competition - you can find here several an very interesting resources on synthetic biology (lectures and introductory material in general)
Tutorial on Biobricks and their Assembly - this web page seems full of useful resources both from a "theoretical" and "practical" point of view...needs a look at!
Basic Cloning and Biobrick Assembly - a must read document with several details on both computational and wet lab details on biobrick handling!
Yet another tutorial on iGEM - the nth tutorial on the processes involved in iGEM participation
Synthetic biology
Review on Synthetic Biology - this is a well structured review of synthetic biology (Davidson University)
Reengineering life - this is the web page of a synthetic biology seminar
Nanocourse on Synthetic Biology - this is the web page of a course at Harvard University
Tim Gardner's PhD Thesis - a good "how to" on genetic toggle-switch building
Using Engineered Scaffold Interactions to Reshape MAP Kinase Pathway Signaling Dynamics. - It is a nice description of a "toolkit of modular molecular components and circuit boards".
Genetic Switches Mini Guide - a mini guide on genetic switches from MIT OCW
Synthetic biology course-Imperial college - This course provides a nice introduction to synthetic biology and on specific aspect of iGEM. Material available: slides of the lectures, list of key publications and web-resources.
Synthetic biology course-Valencia . Nice course organized in 3 parts: training for biologists, training for engineers and training in synthetic biology.
Engineering Bacteria to solve combinatorial problems - a well written paper describing a smart idea
Workshop Synthetic Biology - International Workshop Synthetic Biology which will be held from November 6th to 8th, 2008 in Groningen, The Netherlands.
Color/Smell
Aroma compound - A good reference for different aroma molecules.
Temperature
Vienna RNA web servers - Vienna RNA web servers (including RNAfold and RNAeval)
Rfam database - database containing non-coding RNA families. (contains three different RNA thermometer families)
