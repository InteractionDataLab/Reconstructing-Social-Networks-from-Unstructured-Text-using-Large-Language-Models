Competences
Bastiaan
As a bioinformatics student I have experience with:
Computational biology
Writing software
All the computer nerd stuff: wiki, registration of standard biological parts, ...
Mathematical modeling - not a core competence, but I have some experience with it.
Searching for information in online biological databases (e.g. searching for genes, searching for metabolic pathways with certain functions)
Oscar
My experience in working with cells will be the main contribution probably during this project. I've some knowledge of bioinformatics (BLAST etc. and molecular imaging software). I think that the following competences could be handy within our project
General Lab experience
Knowledge on molecular biology
Well trained pipetting thumb :-)
A little bit of bioinformatics, but that's probably best left to Bastiaan.
Ruud
My contributions and competences are comparable to Oscar's. General lab practice experience from practicals and two interns and some experience in bioinformatics from several courses. My competences:
General lab experience in molecular biology
Experience in team-work from projects and interns
Know-how in the field of molecular biology
Also my thumb is up to the task of pipetting
Some knowledge on bioinformatics
Steven
I have general experience in the laboratory practises, but my contributions to the project will hopefully also be in the fields of ethics in biotechnology. The personal competences that might prove useful in our iGEM project:
General lab experiences
Team project experiences
Ethics in industrial biotechnology
One strong thumb that may prove to be useful for a number of tasks...
Farzad
Softwares: MATLAB, Mechanical Softwares if needed
Bioinspired Computing (Genetic Algorithms,...) , Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic
Rad
Modeling with MATLAB
Numerical modeling and methods
