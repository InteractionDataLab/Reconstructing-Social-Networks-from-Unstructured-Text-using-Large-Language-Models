H2O2 Production Assay
Grow an overnight culture of JI377 transformed with K137076 or luxR (negative control) on pSB1A2 in SOC + Amp.
In the morning, dilute culture 1:100 into 5 ml SOC +Amp +IPTG in triplicate.
Grow cultures to an OD600 of ~0.8, then assay supernatant for hydrogen peroxide approximately every 30 minutes.
1hr after reaching an OD600 of ~0.8, induce cultures with 10 nM AHL.
