Measuring Minimum Inhibitory Concentration
Grow one 5 ml culture to saturation at 37C with shaking in the indicated media and antibiotics as necessary.
Back dilute parent culture 1:50 into 5 ml of the same media and antibiotics plus differing amounts of hydrogen peroxide and let shake at 37C overnight.
Record MIC as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide necessary to prevent overnight turbid growth.
