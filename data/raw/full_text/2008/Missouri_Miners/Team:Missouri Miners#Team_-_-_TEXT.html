In Pichia pastoris, alcohol oxidase (AOX) is the first enzyme in the methanol utilization pathway.  This enzyme is encoded by the AOXI gene.  If exposed to an environment containing both methanol and ethanol, P. pastoris preferentially metabolizes ethanol.  The production of the AOX enzyme is subject to the concentration of ethanol.  This diauxic metabolism may be utilized as an ethanol sensor.  When the AOXI promoter is fused with a gene encoding a fluorescent protein, the activation of the AOXI promoter may be detected by direct observation of fluorescence. Our project is the development of a device containing the AOXI promoter fused with a fluorescent protein gene to create an inexpensive ethanol sensor for a variety of applications. The concentration of ethanol in the environment may be deduced from the time period between exposure of bacteria carrying the device to ethanol and methanol, until the detection of fluorescence.
We're here to save the world.
