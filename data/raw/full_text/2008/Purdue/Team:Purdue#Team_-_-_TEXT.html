Where we're from
This is our home base: The Bindley Bioscience Center.
Bindley is part of Discovery Park at Purdue, the "home to Purdue's  interdisciplinary research programs. It is a place where  scientists and students dare to take on society's 'grand  challenges'; where the vision of today is transformed into the  reality of tomorrow." -Al Rebar, Director of Discovery Park
Pretty nifty, eh?
Outside Purdue, we all pretty much live in Indiana.  Yay, corn!
