VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ACCESSING REFERENCES
When trying to access the research articles, most of them are through Web of Science, which means you must log into WoS through the Purdue Library Site listed below.  The link is the first under Useful Tools Below.  Go to the "Find a database" and click Web of Science (or PubMed depending on the article).  Log in from there and then you should be able to click and retrieve the article or how to get to the article.
