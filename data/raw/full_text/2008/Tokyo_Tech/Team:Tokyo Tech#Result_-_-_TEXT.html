Protocol
figure 1 Hill function
IPTG assay
Objective
By testing how LacI represses the lac promoter, Hill coefficient of lac promoter should be decided. In order to adjust effective concentration of LacI, IPTG was added.
Result & Conclusion
GFP fluorescence intensity was enhanced in an IPTG-dose dependent manner. It indicates that the LacI repression was getting weak by adding IPTG. Taken together with the graph shown in figure 1 and the formulation of Hill function fitting described above, the characteristics of the lac promoter expressed in Hill function was determined.
