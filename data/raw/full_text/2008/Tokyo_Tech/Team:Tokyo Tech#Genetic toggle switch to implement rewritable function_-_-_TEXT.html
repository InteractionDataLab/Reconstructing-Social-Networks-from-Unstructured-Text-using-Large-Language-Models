Genetic toggle switch to implement rewritable function
In order to implement rewritable function, we tried to construct Pressure Inducible Genetic Toggle Switch (in short PIGTS). We thought two types of model - genetic circuit model and mathematical model - so as to construct PIGTS.
Genetic circuit model
figure 5-1 genetic circuit model
1. Writable function
Plac is induced under 30MPa pressure
Express CI and GFP
CI represses PL and causes low LacI concentration
Express increasingly CI and GFP(inserted destruction tags) ⇒ Bright!!
2. Erasable function
PL is induced by heat
Express LacI and LacI represses Plac
Therefore, GFP expression decreases
Mathematical model
Differential equation models
figure 5-2 Atmospheric pressure model. It is known that nPL = 3.0 from earlier studies
figure 5-3 30MPa pressure model
We used two differential equation models and we call them 'atmospheric pressure model' and '30MPa pressure model'.  In order to implement rewritable function, we decided to use the difference of nullclines of each system so as to satisfy the following condition
Converge to high CI concentration state under 30MPa pressure (writable)
Bistable under atmospheric pressure (erasable)
figure 5-4 Desirable condition
IPTG assay
figure 1 Hill function
Objective
By testing how LacI represses the lac promoter, Hill coefficient of lac promoter should be decided. In order to adjust effective concentration of LacI, IPTG was added.
Result & Conclusion
GFP fluorescence intensity was enhanced in an IPTG-dose dependent manner. It indicates that the LacI repression was getting weak by adding IPTG. Taken together with the graph shown in figure 1 and the formulation of Hill function fitting described above, the characteristics of the lac promoter expressed in Hill function was determined. Finally, we obtained nPlac = 2.15.
Calculate the domain of appropriate parameters
figure 5-5 The domain of appropriate parameters if αPlac = 3.0
It is known that Plac activity under 30MPa pressure is 94.0 times stronger than Plac activity under atmospheric pressure, so, β30Plac = 94.0. If 30MPa additional activity rate of PL (β30PL) or the ratio of Plac - RBS strength (αPlac) and PL-RBS strength(αPL) are not appropriate value, we can't construct PIGTS. So we calculated the domain of appropriate β30PL and the ratio of αPlac and αPL.
figure 5-6 Pressure-response ability of PL
We identified β30PL = 1.42 by our experiment under 30MPa pressure(figure 5-6). Therefore, we can implement rewritable function if we choose PL - RBS strength range from 2.4 to 7.4.
