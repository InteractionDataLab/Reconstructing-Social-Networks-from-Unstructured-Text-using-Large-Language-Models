Acrylic container
We create devices for confirming pressure response of lac promoter. This is the first step of creating touch display. This device made of Acrylic glasses and has two holes (show figure). Each hole contains tubes and water. Inside tubes E. coli is cultivated. Pressure can travel to inside tubes. One hole (A) is covered with a plastic tape (show figure). Therefore the hole is pressurized.The other (B) is covered with a block made of an acrylic glass. (show figure) Therefore the hole is not pressurized by water.
          
          
E.coli type in tubes
* “Ptet” on pSB6 plasmid (E.coli strain; JM109)
          
          
After pressurized the container, we observed the E.coli by a fluorescence microscope. The result shows below.
