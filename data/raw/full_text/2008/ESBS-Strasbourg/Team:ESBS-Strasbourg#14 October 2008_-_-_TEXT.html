Sandra & Katja:
In the hope to get a construct, which is transformable in to yeast, meaning which has an auxotrophic marker, we made the following ligations and transformations:
t (1) Ura3 (FI) + Rep_cyc100(=LexAo8_cyc100_CFP_Linker_NLS_adh1term) (FV)
(2) Ura3 (FI) + Rep_cyc73(FV)
(3) Ura3 (FI) + Rep_cyc46(FV)
(4) Ura3 (FI) + Rep_cyc16(FV)
t (5) Ura3 (FI) + tag_NLS(FV)
(6) Ura3 (FI) + tag_hsl1(=Gal1_CFP_Linker_hsl1_adh1term)(FV)
t (7) Ura3 (FI) + pSB1A2(=p1010 digested with EcoRI and SpeI) (old)(FV)
t (8) Ura3 (FI) + pSB1A2 (new)(FV)
t(11) Rep_cyc100 (BV) + Leu2 (BI)
(12) Rep_cyc73 (BV) + Leu2 (BI)
(13) Rep_cyc46 (BV) + Leu2 (BI)
(14) Rep_cyc16 (BV) + Leu2 (BI)
(15) tag_NLS (BV) + Leu2 (BI)
(16) tag_hsl1 (BV) + Leu2 (BI)
t(17) pSB1A2 (=p1010 digested with XbaI and PstI) (BV - old) + Leu2 (BI)
t(18) pSB1A2 (BV - new) + Leu2 (BI)
(28) pSB1A2  (BV - new) + Leu2 (BI - old)
As negativ controlls we ligated and transformed:
(A) pSB1A2 (FV - old)
t (B) pSB1A2 (BV - old)
(C) pSB1A2 (FV - new)
(D) pSB1A2 (BV - new)
(E) water
The constructs marked t were transformed with heat shock into the competent TOP10 cells lefted. All other transformation have been done with a chemical transformation methode using chemical competent dhalpa cells.
