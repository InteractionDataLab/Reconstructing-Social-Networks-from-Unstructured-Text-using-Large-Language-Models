About us
Welcome on our Wiki competitors =P
We are a student-run team from the trinational graduate school "École supérieur de Biotechnologie Strasbourg" (ESBS) located in the capital of Europe - Strasbourg, France.
The ESBS is a joint-venture of the Universities of Freiburg and Karlsruhe in Germany, the University of Bale in Switzerland and the University of Strasbourg in France. Students come from all four partner universities and furthermore from all around the three countries.
Our project is about establishing a regulatory network over several cell generations in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We want to construct a toggle switch that is triggered by cell cycle dependent factors.  This would result in a binary expression pattern like for example GFP expression in every other cell cycle (0-1-0-1). There shall be the possibility to easily extend the system by adding further "bits" of similar construction (e.g. for the second bit the pattern 0-0-1-1). The resulting device would be the basis for a binary cell division counter.
