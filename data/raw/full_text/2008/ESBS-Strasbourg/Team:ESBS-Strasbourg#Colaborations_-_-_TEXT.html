Meeting with the Freiburg Team
Thanks to our local proximity and our connection to our partner University of Freiburg we could establish a fruitful collaboration with the iGEM Freiburg team . In this respect we want to thank them very much for the advices for the overall iGEM procedure as well as the furniture with various plasmids, which we required for our work. We think that both teams enjoyed very much our meeting in Strabourg in October. Not only the discussion of our projects but also conversation on the iGEM competition on its own right brought common ideas up. We agreed, that the link between the teams should be strengthened in some way for that an iGEM community feeling can already develop before the Jamboree and thus the overall power of iGEM can be used  better. Ideas have been to unify various teams to work on one project together, whereby each team is working on a subproject. Whether this would necessarily mean that various project has to be proposed from the organizers was not discussed to the end, since concerns of the loss of the creativity were mentioned. Also the question whether it would be advantage to make such collaborations between teams from one region to allow meetings or whether it would be better to make random groups to increase the intercultural contact was discussed. We are looking forward to see you in Boston.
Leuven
