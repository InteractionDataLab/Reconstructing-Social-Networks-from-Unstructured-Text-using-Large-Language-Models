DryLab
michi: again IRES
There exists a IRES databank
There are exactly three IRES annotated in yeast
PMID 17554033 nice paper, but difficult to read out quantifications
Wiki
General Layout and content (MM)
Modeling
heavy work on the model (RS)
WetLab
Katja:
PCR verification of the BBa_j63002(Adh_ter) clon -> no results, no band of the fragment neither of the primers on the gel(?)
The primer concentration has been checked; it's allright
I will do a Mini prep tomorrow
Paul: -PCR of Gal4 and VP16 from the plasmid given by marielle
conditions: 100ng plasmid, 2.5µL primers, pFusion+MgSO4 buffer 5µL, 5µL dNTP (2mM), pFusion 1u
=>No amplifications, no trace of primers after gel migration (1g agar in 100mL, 100V)
-second migration:
same PCR gal4 product (20 µL in gel this time)
same PCR vp16 product (20 µL in gel this time)
Vp16 for: 1.25µL in 25µL
Vp16 rev: 1.25µL in 25µL
Gal4 for: 1.25µL in 25µL
Gal4 for: 2.5µL in 25µL
Gal4 for: 3.75µL in 25µL
Sandra:
genomic DNA extraction from yeast
PCR with the genomic DNA with TUP1 primers
PCR with lacI primers from the diluted BioBrick (from Friday)
General
The iGEM HQ will send us once again the BioBricks we need. We should get them by Thursday. (KK)
