michi:
Planing of the measurements we will have to perform
Get started with IRES: WOW their exist cell cycle dependent IRESes
Modeling
WetLab
results SD, MM and KK:
TOP10: 5* 10^5 cfu/ug
db3.1: 10^5 cfu/ug
dh5alpha: 10^6 cfu/ug
Primer
the arrived verification primer were resuspended to give a stock solution of 50 µM
aliquots of these primers (4x 10 µM) were produced and everything frozen (-20°C)
Transformation
competent Top10 cells from Invitrogen, protocol from Marias Lab: H2O (negative control), pxj (positive control), 5 BioBricks (EYFP, vector without insert, adh terminator, lacI, lamdba CI), plated on ampicillin
competent db3.1 cells, protocol from Barbaras Lab, DNA was already in KCM and cells were just added and plated, K3 on kanamycin and A2 on ampicillin
competent dh5alpha cells, protocol from iGEM using SOC medium: H2O (negative control), pxj (positive control), BioBrick (EYFP), plated on ampicillin
