Results Transformation
no clones for any of the three BioBricks
clones for the LexA-BD plasmid --> useable for Miniprep
counting:
- dh5a (Mariel) + pxj - KCM : 10^5 cfu/µg  - dh5a (Mariel) + pxj - HS  : 4*10^4 cfu/µg  - dh5a          + pxj - HS  : 1.5*10^5 cfu/µg  - Top10         + pxj - HS  : 3.2*10^5 cfu/µg  - db3.1         + pxj - HS  : 3*10^4 cfu/µg
The new BioBricks arrived so we made an overnight culture of, in LB(Amp):
p1010 in pSB1A3
BBa_c0012 (lacI)
BBa_c0051 (lamda cI)
BBa_j63001 (EYFP)
We plated p1010 in pSB3K3 on LB Kan
Digestion of the plasmid of the BBa_J63002(?) clone with XbaI and SpeI
1x double digestion
1x step by step digestion
result:
digestion seem to have work out in both cases
but the gel shows a high contamination with low molecular RNA, so we know now that RNase is crutial in the eluation buffer
the identity of the clone is still not verifified, because the size small fragement could be determinated
but as the new BioBricks arrived today, there is no longer an interest to go on working on this clone
