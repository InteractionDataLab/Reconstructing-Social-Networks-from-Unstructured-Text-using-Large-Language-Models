From 2008.igem.org
1)Remarks:
2)Protocol:
For insert/vector ligation:
see iGEM protocol
For intra vector ligation:
5 T4 DNA ligase unit, for 25-50ng of DNA
2c) Protocol according to Fermantas
50-400 ng vector
1 to 3 times the molar amount of the insert
2 µl ligation buffer
1 µl ligase
to 20 µl water
-> vortex and spin down
-> 1h at 22°C water bath (in 4°C room)
-> enzyme inactivation at 65°C for 10 min
-> directly usable for the transformation
