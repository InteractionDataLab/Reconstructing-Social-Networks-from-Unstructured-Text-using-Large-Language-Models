Sandra
Maxiprep of plasmid p10101A2 with final amount of 70 µg and a good quality (ratio 260/280 = 1,7)
=> find them in the -20°C fridge in our lab in tubes with different concentrations
Paul Digestion of tetR/lacI/c1 plasmids, in order to check if the biobricks are really there. Used of EcoR1 and Spe1.
=> no results, probably not enough DNA for the digestion. To redo next day.
