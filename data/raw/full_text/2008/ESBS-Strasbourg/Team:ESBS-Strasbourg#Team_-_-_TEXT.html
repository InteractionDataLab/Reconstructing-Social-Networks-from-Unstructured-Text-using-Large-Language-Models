Meet the team
Strasbourg iGEM-Gang
Our team consists of seven students coming from different scientific backgrounds prior to the ESBS. This will help us to deal with the difficulties coming up during this interdisciplinary project. Our shared education at the ESBS however enables us to communicate more easily with each other. All team members are in the final year of their master's degree (diplôme ingénieur) and therefore still fulfill the premise of undergrads after iGEM definition.
We first heard of iGEM through a lecture given by Randy Rettberg at the IGBMC, just next door to the ESBS. He encouraged us to build up a team and recruit supervisors that will be helpful for specific questions depending on the chosen project. As a student-run team, we must handle all portions of our project ourselves, but nevertheless we get a lot of support from many institutes at the ESBS, in the “Upper-Rhine region” and elsewhere.
