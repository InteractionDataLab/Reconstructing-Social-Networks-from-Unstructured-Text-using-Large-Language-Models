Analysis of the sequencing data:
CI09, LC09, LC10 are perfect double operator clones
CI13 was not a isolated clone
TE02 has some indefined bases, but not in the konsensus sequence
TE12 has some indefined bases in the konsensus sequence (maybe only a probleme during sequencing)
LX11 and LX13 only have a single operator insert with some indefined bases
