Katja:
results of the last two days:
We have
mCherry_L_Vp16_L_lexA_L
CFP_cin8_adh1term (Manuels work)
Gal1_CFP_NLS_adh1term
Gal1_CFP_hsl1_adhterm
Gal1_mCherrry_L_lexA_L_VP16_L
So further assemblies will be:
Gal1 (BV - in the freezer) + mCherry_L_Vp16_L_lexA_L (BI - to be done)
Gal1 (BV - in the freezer) + lexA_L_Vp16_L_mCherry_L (BI - to be done)
Gal1 (BV - in the freezer) + CFP_cln2_adhterm (BI - to be remake)
Gal1 (BV - in the freezer) + CFP_cin8-adhterm (BI - to be done)
Gal1_mCherry_L_lexA_L_Vp16_L (FI - to be done) + NLS_adhterm (FV - to be done)
Gal1_mCherry_L_lexA_L_Vp16_L (BV - to be done) + NLS_adhterm (BI - to be done) (for savety)
Leu2 (BI) in pSB1A2 (X+P)
Ura3 (FI) in pSB1A2 (E+S)
General
Katja:
I ordered primers for the Mutagenesis of Leu2 (silent mutation) and Ura3 (in non coding region) so that we can deleted the EcoRI and Pst1 site respectively. According to Mr. Chatton there shouldn't be a problem with transcriptional/translational regulation at this point.
