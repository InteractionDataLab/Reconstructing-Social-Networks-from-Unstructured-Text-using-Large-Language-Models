Team:ESBS-Strasbourg/Concentrations Measurements
From 2008.igem.org
1)by spectrophotometer
step1: Prepare your sample:
2µL of the solution
400µL Water
step2: put lambda=260nm
step3: do the blank with the same water you used for dilution
step4: Do the conversion absorbance->concentrations
1DO = 50µgDNA/mL = 50ng/µL
=>Multiply your DO per 50, and then per 200 for the dilution factor. Then you have your DNA concentrations in ng/µL.
2)By nanodrop
Ask Maria to use it at the Pharma faculty. You only need 1µL of your solution.
