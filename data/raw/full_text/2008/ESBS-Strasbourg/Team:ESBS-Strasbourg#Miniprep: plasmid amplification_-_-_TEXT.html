Team:ESBS-Strasbourg/Miniprep: plasmid amplification
From 2008.igem.org
a) Remarks
Antibiotic
Working concentration
Ampicillin
50-100µg/mL
Chloramphenicol
25-170µg/mL
Kanamycin
10-50µg/mL
Streptomycin
10-50µg/mL
Tetracyclin
10-50µg/mL
b) Protocol
Take one colony and put it in 5 to 7mL of LB medium containing the antibiotic
12 to 16h over night at 37°C, 200-250rpm
Notice that you will need about 3mL of culture to perform the plasmid purification
You can either take the quick purification kit and follow the instruction of the kit discription.
Or if quality is not so important you may use the following methode
b.1) MiniPrepProtocol of the A.P. Sibler course
Spin down 1.5 mL of the Overnight culture (1min at 10 000rpm)
Take off the supernatant leaving around 100 µL medium
Resuspend the cells by vortexing
Add 300µL TENS; vortex 2-5 sec
Add 150µL NaACo(3M pH5)fastly; vortex 2-5 sec
Spin down 5 min at max. speed
Pipette the supernatant in a new tube without getting contamination of the pellet
Add 900µL ice cold ethanol (100% -20°C) and vortex
Spin down 5 min at max. speed, take note of the orientation of the tubes
Take off the supernatant being careful to not detach the pellet
Wash with 1 mL (25% TE and 75%EtOH); DO NOT RESOLVE THE PELLET
Spin 2 min at max. speed
Take off the supernatant and let dry the pellet completely
Resovle in 40µL RB (0,6 mL TE + 10 µL 1% gélatine + 2 µL RNase à 10 mg/mL)
10µL may contain 1µg of plasmid
