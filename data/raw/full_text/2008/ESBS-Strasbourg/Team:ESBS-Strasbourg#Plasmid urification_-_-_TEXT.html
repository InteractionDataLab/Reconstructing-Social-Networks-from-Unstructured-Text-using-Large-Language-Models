Team:ESBS-Strasbourg/Plasmid urification
From 2008.igem.org
a) Remarks
We can estimate the concentration of our final product, by using a spectrophotometer. The wavelength to enter is 260 nm, knowing that 1 unit correspond of a 50µg/mL concentration. Be aware that there is a Nanodrop at the Pharma faculty, and maria proposed us to use it if we need. The advantages are that we can get our plasmid concentration by wasting only 1µL, and we also get the purety of it.
b) Protocol
Follow the Nucleospin kit instructions
