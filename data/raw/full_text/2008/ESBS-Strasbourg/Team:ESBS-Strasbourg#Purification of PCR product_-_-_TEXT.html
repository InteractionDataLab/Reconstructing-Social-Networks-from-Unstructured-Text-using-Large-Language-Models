Team:ESBS-Strasbourg/Purification of PCR product
From 2008.igem.org
I: Purification of classic PCR product
a) Remarks
In this case we obtain linear DNA which could be purified after a Gel migration or directly after the PCR.
Purification's yield
Directly after PCR
~90%
After gel migration
~75%
b) Protocol
See the Quiagen kit instruction for both types of purification.
II: Purification of mutagenesis PCR product
a) Remarks
Here we get the product in a plasmid form. It’s more difficult to purify the new plasmid (which own the mutation) from the original plasmid. There are several possibilities:
-Use of the Dpn1 enzyme, which recognize the methyl Dna, in other words the original plasmid would be degraded. In this case, just add Dpn1 in the PCR product, and after the degradation the solution can be directly employ for transformation
-Purification after gel migration: difficult it will be very hard to distinguish plasmids which own the mutation and the other ones. One possibility could be to use Agarose Low melting point, or to decrease the agarose concentration (0,5 or 0,3). Then be careful cause the gel would be more difficult to handle (fragile)
see Agarose gel preparation
b) Protocol
-see Restriction digestion part for a Dpn1 digestion
-Follow the Quigen kit instruction for traditionnal purification
Take max. 400mg of gel, no more
