You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this is the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)
Lignin is a ubiquitous, extremely complex biopolymer found in plant cells.  It is the most recalcitrant part of the cell wall, and only a few organisms possess the machinery necessary for its degradation.  As a result, a huge proportion of the earth's biomass resources are trapped in a highly degradation resistant lignin matrix.  To make these resources viable for energy and chemical needs, lignin must be broken down to separate the chemical components of biomass.
(Or you can choose different headings.  But you must have a team page, a project page, and a notebook page.)
