Team:Mississippi State/27 June 2008
From 2008.igem.org
June 27, 2008
Received cDNA samples from Jill Gaskell at U. Wisc. Forest Products Lab.
Ran gel to check sample density.  Got faint smear.
Ran PCR of both samples with LiPA primers.
Results showed mostly small fragment formation.
Discussed with Dr. Ma.  He says to do PCR again at higher anneal temp.--> 60C.
Low on Taq Polymerase.
