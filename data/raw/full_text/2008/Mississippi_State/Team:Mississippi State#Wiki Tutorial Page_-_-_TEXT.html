Team:Mississippi State/Wiki Tutorial Page
From 2008.igem.org
This page will hopefully show you how to do some basic things on the wiki.  It is limited by what we have learned, so if you know more, please add it!  To see the exact code for the examples, just click "edit" on the tool bar above.
Editing
The basic idea of wiki is that anybody can edit a page.  Therefore, the first thing you need to know is how to edit a page.  This is pretty simple.  First, you must be a member of the site, i.e. igem.org.  Then, all you have to do is go to a page you want to edit and click "edit" on the top tool bar.  This takes you to the editing page.  In that page, there is a text box where code will appear if the page exists.  You can use wiki formating to add things to the page.  When finished, click "Preview" below the text box to see your work.  Make any changes necessary and click "Save Page".  You have now edited a wiki.
Text
In wiki format, you simply type text into text box on the edit page.  This then appears on the wiki page as you typed it.  To make letters bold, all you do is type three apostrophes before and after.  To see exactly how, click edit beside this section.  You can bullet your content by simply typing Shift+8, or the asterisk key before the words of sentences you want to bullet like this:
First
Second
etc
You can sequentially number content by typing the pound(#) symbol before each word or sentence, but remember that if pound symbols are separated by other symbols, the sequential numbering stops:
Number 1
stuff
Number 1
Number 2
Number 3
Numbers are usually meant to come after bullets in the outline format, as seen in the indention above.
Headers
Directly above this writing there is a header.  Headers allow you to divide content on a page, and they also make it easy to navigate and edit that content.  As you can see, the header is large and in bold face.  It also has its own edit button to the right.  To make a header, put equal signs(=) before and after the title you want like this: =Header=
