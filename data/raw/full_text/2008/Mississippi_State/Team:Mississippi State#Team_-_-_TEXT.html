Papers and Notebook
We are the Biomass Bandits from Mississippi State University.  Our team is made up of two undergraduate students, two graduate advisors, and two academic advisors.  Our undergrads are Sam Pote and Caleb Dulaney, the graduate advisors are Victor Ho and Robert Morris, and the academic advisors are Dr. Din-Pow Ma and Dr. Filip To.  The biofuel emphasis of our project was determined by the University and Dr. To.  The project idea, literature research, and laboratory research was performed exclusively by the two undergraduate students.  Our lab work was done under the supervision of Dr. Ma and the two graduate students.  We often learned the hard way through our mistakes and failures, but we really advanced our knowledge and experience in Synthetic Biology.  Furthermore, we have initiated work on an important problem in the world.  Overall, we have had a blast this summer working in the lab and trying to change the world one cell at a time.
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this is the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)

What we did
The idea was spawned by Sam and Caleb.  The advisors and grad students refined the project and brought is back down to earth.  The lab work, wiki, and team management was done by the undergrads.  Dr. To, Dr. Ma, Victor and Robert kept careful watch over the lab work and helped us with problems.  We worked really hard due to our personnel limitations, but we were able to isolate our gene and submit it to the registry.
