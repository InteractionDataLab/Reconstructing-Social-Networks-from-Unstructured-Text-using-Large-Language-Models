Ran Electro. Gel on PCR Products from 6/24(cDNA(4) and Control)
Results showed no bands for cDNA and good bands for Control, proving that we have problem with cDNA.
Dr. Ma advised we ask Forest Products Lab for fresh RNA, inquire about gene purchase, and inquire other researchers for sample of gene.
Talked to Lee Mangum about RNA... Luckily, he had just done an extraction.  He gave us the Total RNA from Phanerochaete Chrysosporium from 6/23.
Ran Electro. Gel on RNA samples to test if they were good.
Results showed no Ribosomal RNA bands for the RNA.  We concluded the RNA was no good for making cDNA.
