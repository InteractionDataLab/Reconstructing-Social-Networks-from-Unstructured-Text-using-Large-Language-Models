Notebook
worked on designing primer
got sequence for lpoA
analyzed for absent restriction sites
looked at map for pPIC6 to look for cloning sites
ran into problems with the kit we bought.  Invitrogen is ambiguous in their description of vectors.  They had no kit w/alpha-factor secretion so we ordered one with E-factor secretion.  Turns out there is no signal sequence in the vector (Caleb should be more prudent next time).  However, some research has shown it beneficial to use native signal sequence.  Hopefully, this will work.  Nevertheless, we plan on contacting Invitrogen in the morning to sort mess out.
Talked to Lee(Dr. Diehl's Lab).  He said he will make new cDNA from RNA, then PCR lpoA for us.  He plans on starting tomorrow morning and finishing Thurs.
READ MANUAL FOR PICHIA AND pPIC6!!!!!!!
