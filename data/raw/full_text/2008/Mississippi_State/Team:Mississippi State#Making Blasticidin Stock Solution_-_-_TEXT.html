Blasticidin Stock Solution is used to apply to Pichia cell cultures when we use them.  It will kill any cells without the appropriate vector in them.
Pichia cultures require the addition of 100ug/ml working solution.
Measure out desired milligrams of powdered antibiotic
For each mg antibiotic, add 10ul water.
Vortex until dissolved.
If doesn't dissolve, add 10ul water more per mg antibiotic.
Vortex until dissolved. If double amount of water is added, you now have 50ug/ml working solution.
Freeze -20C freezer.
Note: If more water is added to dissolve antibiotic, the working solution is weaker, and more needs to be added to LB.
If you have 100ug/ml working solution, add 1ul for every 1ml LB.
If you have 50ug/ml working solution, add 2ul for every 1ml LB.
