Team:Mississippi State/Check cell density
From 2008.igem.org
To check cell density do the following:
Zero the machine using same LB as used in the cell stock.
Put 1ml Cell stock in vial for machine.
Wipe off the outside of vial with tissue paper.
Place vial in machine and close.
Reading needs to be around 0.4, and at least above 0.3.
If density doesn't meet this criteria, place back in 37C shaker for 5-10min. and check again.
