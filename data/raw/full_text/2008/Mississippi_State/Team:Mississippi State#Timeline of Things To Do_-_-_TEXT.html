Timeline of Things To Do
A
Order Supplies, most importantly the yeast vector(pPIC6alpha) and the gene(one of the LiP genes).
Contact MSU person about possibility of getting LiP here
Research other ways of obtaining the gene
Center for Forest Mycology in Madison, WI has the organism and possibly the gene
B
When we get supplies we need to begin by isolating LiP
Transform into vector and measure expression
Construct LiP BioBrick
Transform into vector and measure expression
Establish control system for expression
Develop an entire system for controlable production and secretion of LiP
C
We should have the pPIC6alpha vector by Monday (June 16), along with the primers for the cDNA. Thus, we will do as follows:
As soon as we get vector, transform into E-Coli for storage
Make glycerol stock for storage of yeast
PCR cDNA from P.C. to isolate LiPA using primers we have ordered.
