1 1% Agarose Gel for Electrophoresis
2 Glycerol Stock for Long-Term Storage
3 Low Salt LB Medium with Blasticidin
4 Pfx50 PCR Mix
5 Taq PCR Mix
6 YPD (+Blasticidin) Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose Medium (1 liter)
7 YPDS + Blasticidin Agar
1% Agarose Gel for Electrophoresis
WEAR GLOVES
Needed: 250ml flask, Agarose, 1xTAE Buffer, ddH2O in squirt bottle, Balance, Spatula, Balance tray, Ethydium Bromide.
Weigh out 0.25g Agarose, adding to flask.
Add 25ml 1xTAE Buffer.
Weigh flask and contents, remembering weight.
Swirl until dissolved.
Microwave until boil 2-3 times.
Allow to cool until just cool enough to touch.
Reweigh flask and contents, adding ddH2O until original weight.
Add 5ul EtBr, swirl.
Pour flask contents into Gel tray, allow to solidify.
Glycerol Stock for Long-Term Storage
Streak original colony out on a Low Salt LB plate containing 100ug/ml blasticidin.  Incubate plate at 37C overnight.
isolate single colony and inoculate into 1-2ml of Low Salt LB containing 100ug/ml blasticidin.
Grow the culture to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.5=0.7).
Mix 0.85ml of culture with 0.15ml sterile glycerol and transfer to a cryovial.
Store at -80C.

Low Salt LB Medium with Blasticidin
10g Tryptone
5g NaCl
5g Yeast Extract
Combine dry reagents above and add deionized, distilled water to 950ml.  Adjust pH to 7.0 with 1N NaOH.  Bring the volume up to liter.  For plates, add 15g/L agar before autoclaving.
Autoclave on liquid cycle at 15psi and 121C for 20min.
Allow the medium to cool to at least 55C before adding the blasticidin to 100ug/ml final concentration.
Store plates at +4C in dark.  Plates containing blasticidin are stable for up to 2 weeks.

YPD (+Blasticidin) Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose Medium (1 liter)
1% yeast extract
2% peptone
2% dextrose (glucose)
+/-2% agar
+/- appropriate concentration of blasticidin
Dissolve: 10g yeast extract    20g peptone    in 900ml water.
Include 20g of agar if making YPD slants or plates.
Autoclave for 20min on liquid cycle.
Add 100ml of 20% dextrose (filter-sterilize dextrose before use).
Cool solution to ~60C and add the appropriate amount of blasticidin from a 10mg/ml stock solution.  Note: It is necesary to include blasticidin in the medium for selection of Pichia transformants only.  Blasticidin may be omitted from the medium when performing expression studies.
Store YPD slants or plates containing blasticidin at +4C.  The shelf life is one to two weeks.

Dissolve: 10g yeast extract    182.2g sorbitol    20g peptone    in 900ml water.
Include 20g of agar if making YPD slants or plates.
Autoclave for 20min on liquid cycle.
Add 100ml of 20% dextrose (filter-sterilize dextrose before use).
Cool solution to ~60C and add the appropriate amount of blasticidin from a 10mg/ml stock solution.  Note: It is necesary to include blasticidin in the medium for selection of Pichia transformants only.  Blasticidin may be omitted from the medium when performing expression studies.
