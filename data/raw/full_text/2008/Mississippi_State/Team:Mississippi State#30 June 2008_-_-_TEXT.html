Team:Mississippi State/30 June 2008
From 2008.igem.org
June 30, 2008
Worked on website all day.
Ran PCR on BKM and RP-78 White Rot samples (2 times) at a higher anneal temp of 60C.
Ran gel on 2nd and 1st products from PCR.
Results showed a faintly visible band.
Concluded we will precipitate DNA then run the remaining amount in a gel to hopefully see band.
