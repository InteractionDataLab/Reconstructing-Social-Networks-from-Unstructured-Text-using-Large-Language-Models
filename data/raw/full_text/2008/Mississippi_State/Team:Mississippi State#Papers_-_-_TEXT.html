Genomic Organization of Lignin Peroxidase Genes of Phanerochaete Chrysosporium
Breakdown of Plant Polymers by Fungi and their Potential for use in Bioremediation
On the Interaction of Lignin Peroxidase with Lignin
Organization and Differential Regulation of a Cluster of Lignin Peroxidase Genes of Phanerochaete chrysosporium
"Why P. chrysosporium maintains multiple isozymes to catalyze presumably similar reactions remains unclear. Some substrate and kinetic differences between LiP isozymes have been observed previously (14, 20) and may indicate specific roles for individual LiPs during lignin depolymerization. Alternatively, it is possible that the majority of LiPs are redundant, having arisen through various chromosomal rearrangements such as duplications, translocations, or unequal crossover events during meiosis. The report of an insertion element that transcriptionally inactivates lipI2 indicates that not all alleles are necessary for efficient lignin depolymerization (17). In addition, there is growing evidence that redundant genes are maintained if they are not deleterious to the organism (18, 39)."
cAMP-Mediated Differential Regulation of Lignin Peroxidase and Manganese-Dependent Peroxidase Production in the White-Rot Basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium
"LIP and MNP gene expression appears to be differentially regulated depending on the intracellular concentration of cAMP. These results show that cAMP plays a key role in the regulation of production of LIPs and MNPs in P. chrysosporium."
Ligninolysis by a Purified Lignin Peroxidase
LiP definitely plays a major role in the initiation of Ligninolysis.  The enzyme alone is capable of breaking the lignin structure, but repolymerization occurs when the proper mechanisms are not present to uptake the polymer units.  Veratryl alcohol was also noted to be of high significance to LiP activity.
