Maintenance of Plasmids
The pPIC6alpha vector contains the blasticidin resistance gene to allow selection of the plasmid using blasticidin.  To propogate and maintain the pPIC6alpha plasmid, use the following procedure:
Resuspend each vector in 20ul sterile water to prepare a 1ug/ul stock solution.  Store the stock solution at -20C
Use the stock solution to transform a recA, endA E.coli strain like TOP10, DH5alpha, JM109, or equivalent.
Select transformants on Low Salt LB plates containing 100ug/ml blasticidin.
Prepare a glycerol stock from each transformant containing plasmid for long-term storage .
