Team:ETH Zurich/Sponsors
From 2008.igem.org
The idea for the project as well as its implementation was done solely by the ETH iGEM 2008 team We would like to thank the whole Lab of Sven Panke for the help and there patience. Especially Andy who was our first place to go when we had troubles in the lab. Furthermore we would like to thank our two heads of the Project, Prof. Dr. Sven Panke and Dr. Prof. Jörg Stelling for making this all possible for us and also for the total freedom we got for choosing our Project Theme.
We would also like to acknowledge the financial support by ETH Zuerich:
