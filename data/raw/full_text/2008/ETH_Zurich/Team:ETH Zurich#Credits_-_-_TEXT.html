Team:ETH Zurich/Credits
From 2008.igem.org
We would like to thank the whole lab of Sven Panke for the help, support and patience. Special thanks go to Andy , who was the first person to ask when there was trouble in the lab. Furthermore, we would like to thank our group leaders, Prof. Sven Panke and Prof. Jörg Stelling for making all this possible and providing us with a great amount of freedom concerning the choice of our project.
We would also like to acknowledge the financial support by ETH Zurich:
Above all, we'd like to thank the MIT iGEM Organization for running this great competition.
