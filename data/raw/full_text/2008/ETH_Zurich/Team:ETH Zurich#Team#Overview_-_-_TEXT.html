Team:ETH Zurich/Team/Overview
From 2008.igem.org
How the Team Met
Part of the team learned about iGEM during the Synthetic Biology Lecture given by our faculty at ETHZ. Another part of the team applied after receiving the following ETHZ-wide e-mail promoting iGEM:
What is the most exciting thing natural scientists and engineers can do together? - The iGEM summer competition!
iGEM is an international student competition in the field of synthetic biology, organized by MIT. Each participating university sets up an interdisciplinary student team consisting of 8 to 10 biologists, chemists and engineers.
Half of the team has to be composed of undergraduate students, but also MSc and PhD students can participate.
The team's goal is to collect ideas on a novel biological system, analyze the biological and engineering design alternatives, including mathematical modeling of the system, and to choose the 'best' design.
This system is then translated into DNA code and tested experimentally in vivo.
In November 2008, all teams shall present their projects at the MIT in Boston. Back in 2007, there were 57 teams participating from all over the world, including teams from MIT, UCSF, Caltech, Duke, Stanford, TIT, Princeton, Cambridge, Imperial, Harvard, UC Berkeley, and more teams from the US, Australia, India, China, Japan, and Europe ( https://2007.igem.org/Main_Page ).
After major successes in 2005 (best engineering), 2006 (best device) and 2007 (best presentation), ETH is participating again this year, and professors Sven Panke and Jörg Stelling are assembling a mixed team of engineers and natural scientists from the Bachelor, Master and PhD level. If you want to be part of the iGEM experience, apply until April 11th.
Nine students got selected for this year's team, and on Wednesday, April 16th, the first meeting was scheduled.
As you can see on our Team Members Page , students from very diverse fields were offered the possibility to participate in the ETH iGEM team.
Boot Camp
The following weeks were what last year's team had referred to as "Boot Camp". Our advisers organized two weeks of an intense crash course into the field of synthetic biology, during which, on the basis of paper discussions, we learned about the diverse aspects of the field:

LABCOURSE at CNB
Basic hands-on modelling
Lab Course
Additionally, one week of lab crash course was integrated into the "Boot Camp" in the beginning of June. The aim of this course was to introduce non-biologists to basic techniques of micro- and molecular biology. That way, the non-biologists were able to assist the biologists, so that the "experts" could concentrate more on experimental planning and on the interpretation of results. The idea was to grasp this chance of an interdisciplinary project and offer the students the possibility to get an insight into a field that differs significantly from their own. Therefore, the modelers became comfortable in the lab, and the biologists learned something about modeling.
