Syntax for the wiki pages
This is a page with templates for all the things that you will need while editing the wiki. You will find instructions on how to insert texts, images, tables, bullet lists and so on. On the right side you see the final result on the wiki, on the left hand side, the things you should write while editing the page. I suggest you to copy the right hand side and paste it on the page you are editing, then modify it as needed. Remember to insert your text only in between the two comments:
<!-- PUT THE PAGE CONTENT AFTER THIS LINE. THANKS :) -->
your text goes here
<!-- PUT THE PAGE CONTENT BEFORE THIS LINE. THANKS :) -->
Text formatting, Links and Lists
This help is taken from wikipedia.
What it looks like
What you type
You can italicize text by putting 2  apostrophes on each side.
3 apostrophes will embolden the text.
5 apostrophes will embolden and italicize the text.
(4 apostrophes don't do anything special -- there's just 'one left over'.)
You can ''italicize text'' by putting 2  apostrophes on each side.   3 apostrophes will embolden '''the text'''.   5 apostrophes will embolden and italicize  '''''the text'''''.  (4 apostrophes don't do anything special -- there's just ''''one left over''''.)
Section headings
Headings organize your writing into sections. The Wiki software can automatically generate a table of contents from them.
Subsection
Using more equals signs creates a subsection.
A smaller subsection
Don't skip levels, like from two to four equals signs.
Start with 2 equals signs not 1 because 1 creates H1 tags which should be reserved for page title.

Unordered lists are easy to do:
Start every line with a star.
More stars indicate a deeper level.
Previous item continues.
A new line
in a list
marks the end of the list.
Of course you can start again.

Numbered lists are:
Very organized
Easy to follow
Previous item continues
A new line marks the end of the list.
New numbering starts with 1.
# ''Numbered lists'' are: ## Very organized ## Easy to follow #: Previous item continues A new line marks the end of the list. # New numbering starts with 1.
A colon (:) indents a line or paragraph.
A newline starts a new paragraph.
Often used for discussion on talk pages .
We use 1 colon to indent once.
We use 2 colons to indent twice.
3 colons to indent 3 times, and so on.

Tables
How it looks:
The table's caption
Column heading 1
Column heading 2
Column heading 3
Row heading 1
Cell 2
Cell 3
Row heading A
Cell B
Cell C
How it is written:
{| border="1" |+ The table's caption ! Column heading 1 !! Column heading 2 !! Column heading 3 |- ! Row heading 1 | Cell 2 || Cell 3 |- ! Row heading A |Cell B |Cell C |}
Images
How it looks:
caption text
How it is written:
[[Image:Start_a_team.jpg|frame|none|caption text]]
If you put 'right' at the place of 'none', it will stay on the right with text on the left, if you put a '200px' and 'thumb', you will resize it to 200 pixel:
caption text
[[Image:Start_a_team.jpg|thumb|right|200px|caption text]]
Uploading a file
To upload a file is very easy. Just go to the bottom of this page and search for the link 'upload file'. Click on it and follow the instructions. Remember that you need to upload an image if you want to show it on the wiki (and it is not on an external server).
