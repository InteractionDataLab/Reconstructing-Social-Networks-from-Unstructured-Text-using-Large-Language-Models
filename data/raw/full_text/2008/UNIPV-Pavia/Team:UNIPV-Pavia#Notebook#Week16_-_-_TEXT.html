Week 16: 09/1/08 - 09/5/08
09/1/08
We had to perform these ligations:
Lig.22-R0062
Lig.31-Lig.22
but we didn't have enough Lig.22 and Lig.31 plasmids...
We infected 9 ml of LB + Amp with 30 µl of Lig.22 and Lig.31 glycerol stocks.
09/2/08
Glycerol stocks/miniprep for Lig.22 and Lig.31.
Plasmid digestion for:
Lig.22 (E-S)
Lig.22 (X-P)
Lig.31 (S-P)
R0062 (E-X)
Run/gel extraction.
Ligations:
Lig.31-Lig.22 (=Lig.35)
Lig.22-R0062 (=Lig.30)
We incubated ligations at 16°C overnight.
09/3/08
We transformed/plated ligations.
09/4/08
Colony PCR for the two ligation plates
Marker 1Kb, Lig.30 (5 colonies), Marker 1Kb, Lig.35 (5 colonies)
Gel results:
Lig.30 (3rd colony)
Lig.35 (gel showed an unexpected contaminant...we decided to re-perform this ligation)
09/5/08
Glycerol stock/miniprep for Lig.30.
We sent Lig.30 (3rd col) to Primm for sequencing.
