To perform this, we use protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions to build up biological logic gates.
Mux and Demux logic circuits are composed by three fundamental logic gates, AND, OR, NOT: in the next paragraphs genetic implementation of these logic gates will be provided.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="AND"> AND </SPAN></H3><P>To mimic an AND gate, we need a biological function, such as a promoter activation, which is directly turned on by the interaction between two upstream genes. In our synthetic devices, we use the luxR/luxI system: luxR can activate Plux promoter only upon 3-oxo-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (HSL) binding; luxI generates HSL; so, only the contemporary expression of LuxR and luxI proteins can activate the downstream Plux-dependent gene expression. Another AND gate we use is the lasR/lasI system, which works in a very similar way but through another chemical intermediate, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (PAI-1).
</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:342px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Genetic AND: Plux can be turned on only when the two proteins luxI and luxR are present.</DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="OR"> OR </SPAN></H3><P>To mimic an OR gate in Mux, we need a biological function which can be activated alternatively by two independent upstream signals or by both. Thus, we combine the outputs of the upstream AND gates to assemble directly an OR reporter function, by simply repeating the reporter gene (GFP) under two different promoters (Plux and Plas). Itâs sufficient to activate one of the two promoters (or both) to recover the GFP signal from engineered bacteria.
There should not be an over-expression problem for GFP, in fact, in Mux device, only one promoter can be active, either Plux or Plas. Here we considered GFP output, but OR device can be generalized for every output gene.

So, input promoters and output protein generators are not part of the genetic Mux we want to build up. In this way, a hypothetical user can re-use our device assembling the desired input and output elements.

Note that the output genes are two, but, as explained in &quot;OR&quot; section, if the genes are identical, we can say that there is only one output; in fact, the real output is a protein synthesis and so it is not important which of the two identical genes is expressed.

However, it is possible to assemble two different genes downstream of Plux and Plas, for example two reporters. In this way, debugging process becomes easy, because we can discriminate lux system and las system activities.

Here we report the truth table of this network:

&quot;A&quot; molecule is not present, so PA promoter is not active and luxI gene is not expressed.

&quot;B&quot; molecule is present, so PB promoter is active and lasI gene is expressed.

&quot;S&quot; molecule is present, so PS promoter is active and lasR and cI genes are expressed.

cI protein represses transcription of the gene downstream of Plambda promoter, which is luxR.

lasI protein can synthesize 3-OC12-HSL. This molecule activates transcription factor lasR, which can activate Plas promoter. So, the copy of GOI gene under Plas regulation can be expressed.

The other copy of GOI gene, which is under Plux promoter regulation, is not expressed. In fact Plux is not active, because both luxI and luxR proteins are not present.

Only one of the two GOI genes is expressed, but this is sufficient to synthesize the output protein GOI.

&quot;A&quot; molecule is not present, so PA promoter is not active and luxI gene is not expressed.

&quot;S&quot; molecule is not present, so PS promoter can't transcribe cI and lasR genes.

cI protein is not present, so Plambda promoter can transcribe luxR gene.

None of the two logic AND systems is active, because lux system lacks of luxI and las system lacks of lasR. So, Plux and Plas promoters are unactive and can't express GOI genes. For this reason, GOI protein is not synthesized.

These two examples show how &quot;S&quot; molecule can select the input to be conveyed into the single output channel: in fact its presence allows lasR expression and represses luxR expression, while &quot;S&quot; absence represses lasR expression and allows luxR expression.

Tetracycline and IPTG can be considered as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; molecules, introduced in &quot;Genetic Mux&quot; section, because both Tetracycline and IPTG are indirect ACTIVATORS of Ptet and Plac promoters respectively.
On the other hand, red light is quite different from &quot;S&quot; molecule, because red light is an indirect REPRESSOR of Pomp promoter and not an activator as required by the original schema. For this reason, if we want a device in which the presence of Tetracycline, IPTG and red light correspond to logic 1, red light input should be <I>inverted</I>. The simplest way to do this, is to cross-exchange the two input channels. So, Tetracycline sensor (CH0) has to be assembled to las system and IPTG sensor (CH1) has to be assembled to lux system.

cI protein binds Plambda promoter and so luxR expression is inhibited.
TetR is a repressor for Ptet promoter, but Tetracycline is present, so it can bind tetR protein, which is constitutively expressed, and can activate transcription of downstream gene: lasI.

cI protein binds Plambda promoter and so luxR expression is inhibited.
Simultaneous expression of lasI and lasR can activate GFP, which is under Plas promoter.
There is no simultaneous expression of luxI and luxR, so RFP (which is under Plux regulation) cannot be expressed.

</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Applications">Applications</SPAN></H2><P>Mux and Demux are two fundamental devices in electronics. They are used in several applications, for example in communication devices, in Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), or, in general, in applications that involve channel sharing.

Analogously, they could play a crucial role in the building of complex genetic circuits. In fact, both of them can be used as controlled genetic switches.

Because our devices had been designed to be general, their application field is very wide. For example, genetic Mux can be used to integrate signals from the environment in a two-inputs and one-output biosensor; once detected, the selector controls which of the two inputs must be transferred in output. In this way, two sensing devices can be integrated in only one circuit that can compute multiplexing logic function.
On the other hand, genetic Demux can be used for controlled protein productions, where the choice of the protein to produce is made by the selector. In this case, we can imagine an industrial process where two consequent enzyme reactions are necessary to build a final product. Using a Demux, we can consider the two enzymes as system outputs and then we can easily switch on and off their production modulating selection signal.

Selector in Mux and Demux can be set manually, but also controlled automatically. In fact, it is possible to use feedback control to pilot the selector. For example, in Demux it is possible to switch the enzyme production when a specific condition (for example a pH threshold) is reached.

Switching activity in these two devices is a very powerful tool to manage multi-input and multi-output systems.
