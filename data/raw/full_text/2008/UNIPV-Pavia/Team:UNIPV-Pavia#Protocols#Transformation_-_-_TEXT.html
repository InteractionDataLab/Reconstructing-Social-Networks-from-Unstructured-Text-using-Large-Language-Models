The protocols we used
LB medium preparation
Plasmid resuspension from IGEM paper spots
Transformation
Plasmid extraction
BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
DNA gel extraction
DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
Antarctic Phosphatase
Ligation
PCR
Transformation
(estimated time: 3 hours and 30 min + 12-16 hours overnight incubation)
Materials needed:
LB agar plates with proper antibiotic added incubated at 37°C
Thawed Invitrogen TOP10 cells (every tube contains approximately 60 µl of competent cells)
Resuspended DNA
SOC medium
Put 4-6 µl of DNA resuspension into TOP10 tube.
Incubate on ice for 30-45 min.
Heat shock: 42°C for 1 min.
Put transformed TOP10 tube on ice and then add 250 µl SOC medium.
Incubate 2 hours at 37°C, 220 rpm.
Centrifuge 10 min, 1200 rpm.
Remove 150 ul of bacteria-free supernatant.
Plate the remaining part of solution (resuspending the bacteria) on a proper agar plate.
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
