Colony PCR for B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079: 6 colonies from single colonies plate.
B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079
Gel results: all the 6 picked colonies were true positive! we chose the 5th colony to grow a 9 ml overnight culture.
We also infected 9 ml LB + Amp with 30 µl of J23100-B0030-C0040-B1006-R0040 and B0030-C0061 glycerol stocks to grow two overnight cultures.
Ligation:
J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006 (1:2 ratio, 40 ng of vector)
B0030-I15009-B1006-R0082 (30 ng of vector)
B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006-R0062
B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006
We incubated ligations at 16°C overnight.
07/22/08
Transformation for the 4 overnight ligations (1 µl). We plated transformed bacteria and incubated plates at 37°C overnight.
Glycerol stocks/miniprep for:
J23100-B0030-C0040-B1006-R0040
B0030-C0061
B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079
We sent J23100-B0030-C0040-B1006-R0040 and B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079 purified plasmids to Primm for sequencing.
Plasmid digestion for:
B0030-C0061 (E-S)
B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079 (E-X)
Gel run/cut/gel extraction.
07/23/08
Ligation plates showed colonies!We put ligation plates at +4°C.
Ligation for B0030-C0061-B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079.
We incubated ligation at 16°C overnight.
07/24/08
Transformation (1 µl) for B0030-C0061-B0030-C0078-B1006-R0079 ligation. We plated transformed bacteria and incubated plate at 37°C overnight.
Colony PCR for:
J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006
B0030-I15009-B1006-R0082
B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006-R0062
B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006
(We performed one PCR for J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006 and B0030-I15009-B1006-R0082 with 2 min elongation and another PCR for the remaining two ligations with 3 min elongation).

Electrophoresis (1.2% agarose) for J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006 and B0030-I15009-B1006-R0082:
Marker 1Kb, blank, J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006 (7 lanes), B0030-I15009-B1006-R0082 (6 lanes)

Gel results:
J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006 1st colony
B0030-I15009-B1006-R0082 1st colony
B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006-R0062 1st and 3rd colony
B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006 1st and 4th colony
We decided to keep two colonies for B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006-R0062 and B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006 ligations because they are important parts for our project and we wanted to be sure they were correct.
The fifth colony of B0030-C0051-B0030-C0079-B1006-R0051-B0030-C0062-B1006-R0062 showed an unexpected length...(@_@?) We decided to ignore it. Sequencing results will tell us if we made mistakes in assemblies.
We infected 9 ml LB + Amp with chosen colonies to grow 6 overnight cultures.
