The protocols we used
LB medium preparation
Plasmid resuspension from IGEM paper spots
Transformation
Plasmid extraction
BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
DNA gel extraction
DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
Antarctic Phosphatase
Ligation
PCR
Ligation
(estimated time: 20 min + 12-16 hours overnight incubation)
Materials needed:
Roche T4 Ligase
10X Roche T4 Ligase Buffer
ddH2O
(For every ligation)
Add 50 ng of vector
Add
Heat DNA mix at 65°C for 5 min for DNA denaturation
Add 1 µl of T4 Ligase buffer
Add 1 µl of T4 Ligase
10 µl final volume
Incubate at 16°C overnight
Then, ligation can be conserved at 4°C or can be transformed
Before transformation you have to inactivate T4 Ligase:
Heat ligation at 65°C for 10 min.
