Plasmid extraction
(Estimated time: 3 hours if you use QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit; 1 hour if you use QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit)
Materials needed:
5 ml or 9 ml (for higher yields) overnight mini-culture
QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit or QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit
Follow QIAGEN standard protocol: QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit protocol or QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep protocol
We used QIAGEN Plasmid Mini Kit in the first 2 weeks of our activity to perform miniprep, when we didn't have QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit at our disposal. Then, we always used QIAGEN QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit for its higher yield.
