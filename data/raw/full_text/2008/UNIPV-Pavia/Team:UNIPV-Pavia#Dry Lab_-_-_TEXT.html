Biomedical Informatics Lab - DIS
Our lab is distributed over 7 rooms, in which 6 professors and 30 researchers and students work. The main research activities are mathemathical modeling of biomedical systems, bioinformatics, medical informatics, telemedicine, clinical data mining and knowledge management.
We have about 30 PCs, two Unix workstations and a Linux cluster of 15 nodes. On these machines, some software tools are running, such as MathWorks MatLab and its toolboxes for which we have a complete Campus License. We also have free access to the most important journals of IEEE, Elsevier, Blackwell, Kluwer, Nature, Springer and Wiley.
