Colony PCR (5 colonies for each plate) for:
BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0012 (for the second time, we hoped to find true positive colonies)
BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_I15010 (for the second time, we hoped to find true positive colonies)
BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040-BBa_B1006
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0051-BBa_B0030
BBa_B0030-BBa_E1010-BBa_B1006
Colony PCR: Marker (1), empty (2) BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0012, BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_I15010, BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040-BBa_B1006, BBa_B0030-BBa_C0051-BBa_B0030, BBa_B0030-BBa_E1010-BBa_B1006, blank
Gel results:
No true positives for BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0012
No true positives for BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_I15010
Non pure true positives for BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040-BBa_B1006
Pure true positives for BBa_B0030-BBa_C0051-BBa_B0030
Non pure true positives for BBa_B0030-BBa_E1010-BBa_B1006
We chose to keep the first colony for all the 3 working ligation plates.
NOTE: BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040-BBa_B1006 and BBa_B0030-BBa_E1010-BBa_B1006 are final parts; we decided to sequence these 2 parts even if gel showed a weak contamination: sequencing results will tell us if there are false positive plasmids in those colonies or if the contamination was only a PCR contamination.
We infected 9 ml LB + suitable antibiotic with 30 µl of these glycerol stocks:
BBa_B0030
BBa_I15010

07/8/08

We infected 100 µl LB + Amp with the tips and incubated the culture at 37°C, 220 rpm for 2 hours.
Then we watched green, blue and red fluorescence channels at microscope (50 µl of each culture):
3 acquisitions for red cells; 3 acquisition for green cells; one acquisition for DAPI channel (blue) for green cells to check for impurities (DAPI channel acquisition for red cells was not saved, but it didn't show any blue area)
LB preparation: 0.5 l LB + Amp for plates.
