Plasmid resuspension from IGEM paper spots
(estimated time: 25 min + 5 min for every part if you use scalpel/tweezers or + 15 min for every part if you use punch tool)
Materials needed:
Pre-warmed at 42°C TE
Desired spot location information
Scalpel and tweezers (or punch tool)
ddH20
99% ethanol
0.5 ml tubes
Put 10 µl of pre-warmed TE into a 0.5 ml tube.
Cut paper spots using scalpel and tweezers (or punch tool, following the instructions provided with the IGEM kit); if you use scalpel and tweezers, try to cut pieces of about the same dimension of the punch tool.
Put the cut paper into the 0.5 ml tube.
Clean scalpel and tweezers (or punch tool) with water and ethanol every time you cut a spot; be careful to dry your tools correctly, especially if you use punch tool, which needs much more time to dry than scalpel/tweezers.
Incubate at 42°C for 20 min.
Vortex and spin down.
