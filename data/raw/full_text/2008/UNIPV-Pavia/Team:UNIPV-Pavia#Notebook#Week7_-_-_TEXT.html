06/30/08
We received sequencing results for BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061 (4th colony and 7th colony): sequences were correct! We decided to keep the 4th colony.
Colony PCR for BBa_J23100-BBa_E0240 and BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061: 5 colonies for every plate. Gel showed many working colonies: we chose first colonies for the two ligations.
Colony PCR for BBa_J23100-BBa_E0240, BBa_B0030-BBa_E0061: Marker and 5 colonies for each ligation
We infected 9 ml LB + Amp with 30 µl of:
BBa_C0012
BBa_B1006

BBa_R0051-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0062
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061-BBa_B1006
We incubated ligation reaction at 16°C overnight.
07/2/08
We transformed ligations (5 µl) and plated transformed bacteria.
We also transformed BBa_B1006(E-X), BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030(S-P) and BBa_R0051-BBa_B0030 (1 µl) and plated transformed bacteria to estimate background noise.
We received sequencing results for:
BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0051
BBa_B0030-BBa_E1010
All the sequences were correct!
We infected 9 ml LB + Amp with 30 µl of:
BBa_B0030
BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0051

glycerol stocks.
07/3/08
All the ligation plates showed carpets, while negative control plates showed a weak background noise.
Single colonies plates for ligation plates.
Glycerol stocks for:
BBa_B0030

Electrophoresis for PCR result: unfortunately, BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0012 and BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_I15010 did not show any true positive colony. We decided to re-perform colony PCR for these two parts next week. We chose to keep the first colonies for the other 3 ligations to grow 9 ml cultures overnight.
Colony PCR: Marker (1), BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0012 (2-4), BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0040 (5-7), BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030-BBa_I15010 (8-10), BBa_R0051-BBa_B0030-BBa_C0062 (11-13), BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061-BBa_B1006 (14-16), blank (17)
07/5/08
All the ligation plates showed colonies! Next week we will perform colony PCR to find true positive colonies.
