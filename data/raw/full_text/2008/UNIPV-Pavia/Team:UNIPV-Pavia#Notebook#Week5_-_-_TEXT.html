06/16/08
We picked up the only colony in BBa_B0030-BBa_C0078 plate to grow a 9 ml culture of transformed bacteria overnight.
We also infected 9 ml of LB + suitable antibiotic with 30 µl of:
BBa_B0030
BBa_E1010
BBa_E0040
BBa_C0061
BBa_C0051
glycerol stocks. We incubated the 9 ml culture overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.
06/17/08
Glycerol stocks for:
BBa_B0030
BBa_E1010
BBa_E0040
BBa_C0061
BBa_C0051
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0078
Miniprep for all these parts.
Digestion for:
BBa_B0030 (S-P)
BBa_E1010 (X-P)
BBa_E0040 (X-P)
BBa_C0061 (X-P)
BBa_C0051 (X-P)
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0078 (X-S)
Gel run for BBa_B0030-BBa_C0078 to check for insert length: unfortunately, there was not a band where we expected...the only colony was a false positive. We'll try to ligate it in the next days.
Gel run for:
BBa_B0030 (S-P)
BBa_E1010 (X-P)
BBa_E0040 (X-P)
BBa_C0061 (X-P)
BBa_C0051 (X-P)
Gel cut and DNA extraction.
We put DNA at -20°C. The next day we will perform some ligation reaction in different conditions, looking for the best protocol.
06/18/08
We planned the following ligation experiments:
Transformation with BBa_B0030(S-P), to check background noise (we will know the amount of not digested vector);
Transformation with this ligation: BBa_B0030(S-P) after Antarctic Phosphatase treatment and no insert;
Transformation with this ligation: BBa_B0030(S-P) without Antarctic Phosphatase treatment and no insert;
Transformation with this ligation: BBa_B0030(S-P) without Antarctic Phosphatase treatment and BBa_C0061 insert;
Transformation with this ligation: BBa_B0030(S-P) after Antarctic Phosphatase treatment and BBa_C0061 insert;
3 Transformation with these ligations: BBa_B0030(S-P) after Antarctic Phosphatase treatment and BBa_C0051, BBa_E1010, BBa_E0040 inserts;
Antarctic Phosphatase for half of BBa_B0030 (S-P) volume.
We transformed 60 µl of TOP10 with 1 µl of BBa_B0030 (S-P)
We plated transformed bacteria and incubated them at 37°C overnight.
Antarctic Phosphatase for half a BBa_B0030 (S-P) volume.
Ligation (10 µl final volume):
BBa_B0030 alone
BBa_B0030 (no Ant.Phosph.) alone
BBa_B0030(no Ant.Phosph.)-BBa_C0061
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0078
BBa_B0030-BBa_E0040
BBa_B0030-BBa_E1010
We gave a lecture about Synthetic Biology and our current work at DIS (Department of Informatics and System Science).
06/19/08
We received sequencing results for:
BBa_J23100-BBa_E0240 (4 samples from 4 different colonies): all the 4 colonies were false positives
BBa_J23100-BBa_B0030: the sequence was correct!
BBa_R0051-BBa_B0030: the sequence was correct!
BBa_B0030(S-P) plate showed many colonies. We expect to find at least this amount of colonies in ligation plates.
We heated ligation at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate T4 Ligase.
We transformed 10 µl of the following ligations:
BBa_B0030 alone
BBa_B0030(no Ant.Phosph.) alone
BBa_B0030 (no Ant.Phosph.)-BBa_C0061
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061
We didn't transform the other 3 ligations because we wanted to check plated transformation the next day, to save 3 agar plates if the experiment doesn't work.
06/20/08
Transformation results:
BBa_B0030 alone showed many colonies (less than BBa_B0030(S-P) seen the previous day)
BBa_B0030(no Ant.Phosph.) alone showed many colonies (the same quantity of BBa_B0030(S-P) seen the previous day)
BBa_B0030 (no Ant.Phosph.)-BBa_C0061 showed a carpet
BBa_B0030-BBa_C0061 showed a carpet
Now we are happy with these plates! Next week we will check insert length by colony PCR/electrophoresis.
