08/25/08
Plasmid digestion for:
R0051 (S-P)
R0040 (S-P)
B0030-C0061-B1006-R0062-B0030-E0040-B1006 (E-X) (=Lig.b (E-X))
B1006 (E-X)
Lig.12 (E-S)
Run/gel extraction.
Ligations:
BBa_R0051 (S-P) - BBa_E0240 (X-P) (for promoter test)
BBa_R0040 (S-P) - BBa_E0240 (X-P) (for promoter test)
Lig.12 (E-S) - B0030-C0061-B1006-R0062-B0030-E0040-B1006 (E-X) (for AND logic gate test)
Lig.12 (E-S) - BBa_B1006 (E-X) (to re-perform mutated assemblies)
We incubated ligations at 16°C overnight.
We ordered 3OC6HSL (Sigma).
08/26/08
We transformed/plated ligations.
08/27/08
Plates grew correctly. We checked colony fluorescence of three plates under UV rays:
R0051-E0240 glowed
R0040-E0240 glowed
Lig.12-Lig.b (R0051-B0030-C0062-B0030-C0061-B1006-R0062-B0030-E0040-B1006) glowed
We picked up fluorescent colonies from these three plates to infect three 15 ml falcon tubes containing 1 ml of LB + Amp. We let the culture grow at 37°C, 220 rpm for 3 hours, then we prepared three 50 ul samples and watch them at microscope. Results are shown in The Project section (Experiments).
Colony PCR for 5 colonies of Lig.12-B1006 (called Lig.22).
Lig.22 (5 colonies), Marker 1Kb
Gel results: OK! we chose 1st colony to grow a 9 ml overnight culture.
08/28/08
Glycerol stocks/miniprep for Lig.22.
We sent purified plasmids to Primm for sequencing.
We infected 9 ml of LB + Amp with 30 µl of R0062 glycerol stock.
08/29/08
Glycerol stock/miniprep for R0062.
