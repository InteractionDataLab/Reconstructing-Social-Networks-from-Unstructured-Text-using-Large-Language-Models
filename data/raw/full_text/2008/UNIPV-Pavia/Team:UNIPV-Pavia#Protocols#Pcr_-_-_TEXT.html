The protocols we used
LB medium preparation
Plasmid resuspension from IGEM paper spots
Transformation
Plasmid extraction
BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
DNA gel extraction
DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
Antarctic Phosphatase
Ligation
PCR
PCR
(estimated time: 3 hours and 30 min)
Materials needed:
MgCl2
Buffer
dNTPs
ddH2O
Taq Polymerase
VF2 primer
VR primer
For every DNA sample you want to amplify, put:
2 µl buffer
0.6 µl MgCl2
0.4 µl dNTPs
1 µl DNA (or ddH2O for blank sample). If you are performing a colony PCR, pick up the desired colony from a plate with a tip and dip it in the solution.
0.2 µl Taq Polymerase
250 nM VF2 primer
250 nM VR primer
A proper amount of ddH2O to have 20 µl of total reaction volume
into an eppendorf tube.
Put the eppendorf tube in the thermal cycler and set this program:
95°C 10 min
CYCLE:
95°C 30 sec
60°C 1 min
72°C 1-3 min
for 35 cycles
72°C 7 min
16°C forever.
Now you can add a loading buffer to the solution and perform electrophoresis to check the amplified sequence length.
