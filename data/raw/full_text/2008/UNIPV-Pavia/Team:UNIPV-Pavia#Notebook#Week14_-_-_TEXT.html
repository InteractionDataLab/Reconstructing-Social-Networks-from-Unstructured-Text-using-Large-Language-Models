Sequencing results:
J23100-B0030-C0012-B1006-R0010 - completely wrong sequence
C0062 - OK
Lig.12 - OK
Lig.22 - point mutation C->T
Lig.30 - point mutation C->T
We decided to restart from Lig.12, whose sequence was correct, to perform ligations Lig.22, Lig.30, Lig.34 and Lig.35.
We prepared 0.5 l of LB + Amp for plates.
We infected 9 ml LB + Amp with 30 µl of B0030-C0061-B1006-R0062-B0030-E0040-B1006 and Lig.12 glycerol stocks.

Glycerol stocks/miniprep for B0030-C0061-B1006-R0062-B0030-E0040-B1006 and Lig.12.
We planned experiments for qualitative and quantitative tests.
