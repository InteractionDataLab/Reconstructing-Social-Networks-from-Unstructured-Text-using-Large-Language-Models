The protocols we used
LB medium preparation
Plasmid resuspension from IGEM paper spots
Transformation
Plasmid extraction
BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
DNA gel extraction
DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
Antarctic Phosphatase
Ligation
PCR
DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
(estimated time: 1 hour)
Materials needed:
sodium acetate
absolute ethanol
ethanol 70%
ddH2O
previously cut plasmid
Add 1/10 digestion volume of sodium acetate 3 M
Add 2.5 digestion volume of absolute ethanol
Freeze at -80°C for 30 min
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm, 4°C for 20 min
Decant supernatant
Add 50 µl of 70% ethanol
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm, 4°C for 20 min
Remove all supernatant with a pipette
Air dry pellet until ethanol is totally removed
Elute with 5 µl ddH2O
