Demux - Input
01 part has not been submitted to the registry because it was a test assembly.
Red-highlighted parts (11, 21, 29, 33) contain I15010 (cph8): according to IGEM DNA Repositories Quality Control (and according to our results) the sequence is inconsistent and so these parts cannot be assembled.
Green-coloured parts have been succesfully sequenced.
Blue-coloured parts are long parts and have not been totally sequenced. The sequenced portions were correct.
Red-coloured parts have been sequenced and a point mutation in C0062 coding sequence (position 349, G->C) was noticed, but these parts seemed to work and so we decided to submit them.
24, 25, 34, 35, 36 are parts of our final Mux or Demux systems.
Sequencing results of all the sequenced parts containing C0061 and C0078 showed that these two coding sequences have an undocumented barcode downstream. This should be documented on C0061 and C0078 Registry pages!
Parts in gray were programmed, but they have not been assembled and so they haven't been submitted.
