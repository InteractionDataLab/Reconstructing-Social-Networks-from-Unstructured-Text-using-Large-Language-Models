Antarctic Phosphatase
(estimated time: 1 hour and 30 min)
Materials needed:
NEB Antarctic Phosphatase
10X NEB Antarctic Phosphatase buffer
Cut and gel-extracted vector
Add the proper amount of 10X buffer to a final concentration of 1X (e.g. 2 µl of 10X buffer in a final volume of 20 µl).
Add 1 µl of Antarctic Phosphatase (up to 5 µg of cut vector).
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour (Antarctic Phosphatase works).
Incubate at 65°C for 15 min (Antarctic Phosphatase inactivation).
