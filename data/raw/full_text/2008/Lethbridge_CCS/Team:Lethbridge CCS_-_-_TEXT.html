Team:Lethbridge CCS
From 2008.igem.org
The Lethbridge CCS team is made up of high school students from Calvin Christian School, near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.  We are loosely affiliated with the University of Lethbridge team.
Our focus for iGEM 2008 is on ligase-independent cloning (LIC).  In existing, commonly-used cloning protocols, the ligation step is often problematic and inefficient.  We believe that LIC can simplify and speed up the cloning procedure, and  we plan to try out a LIC procedure which we believe will be of interest for general use by iGEM teams and others.
