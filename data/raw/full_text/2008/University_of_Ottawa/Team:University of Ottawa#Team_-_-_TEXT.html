Who we are
Advisors
Dr. Mads Kaern
Systems Biology
Dr. Kaern was appointed Canada Research Chair in Systems Biology in 2004. He is a core member of the Ottawa Institute of Systems Biology, and an Assistant Professor of Cellular & Molecular Medicine with cross-appointment in the Department of Physics at the University of Ottawa. With expertise in genetic engineering, dynamical systems theory and computational modelling, Dr. Kaern focuses on complex gene regulatory processes. This research aims at understanding fundamental properties governing cellular signal processing and transduction to facilitate advances in biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and biomedicine, including stem cell research and studies of multifaceted disease.

Dr. Illimar Altosaar
Biochemistry, Microbiology and Immunology
Dr. Altosaar is a world-renowned expert on plant biology and genetically modified organisms. He is a Full Professor working with the Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology & Immunology, and the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Ottawa. He is the Director of Agricultural Biotechnology Laboratories at the University of Ottawa. He sits on the Scientific Advisory Board of Cell Reserves Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He is also the Co-founder of Vitegen, Inc. Raleigh, NC, USA. Over the past decade, Dr. Altosaar’s basic research in gene expression in plants and DNA transformation of global food crops formed an important part of the International Rice Biotechnology Program funded by The Rockefeller Foundation. To increase food yields and decrease environmental carcinogens, Dr. Altosaar’s laboratory synthesized plant codon optimized genes for entomocidal Bacillus toxins that have been deployed in many major crops throughout the world.

Dr. Doug Johnson
Plant Molecular Biology
Dr. Johnson is an Associate Professor working with the Department of Biology at the University of Ottawa. He and his research team are studying the structure and regulation of soybean genes implicated in fundamental processes such as nitrogen fixation and seed development. They are especially interested in the expression of foreign proteins and enzymes in the seed coat and the use of these enzymes in industrial and agricultural processes.

Where we're from
We are Canada's university
Here at the University of Ottawa located in Canada's capital city, we live and play in English, French or both. There are collaborative research projects and student-exchange programs through some 140 bilateral agreements with sister universities in close to 50 countries. It is a multicultural environment that welcomes students and professors from virtually every continent. We encourage all to gain new experiences by taking part in the many international, government and cultural events staged in our own backyard, the nation's capital.
The University of Ottawa is one of Canada's leading research-intensive universities - we are uncompromising in our dedication to fostering excellence in research. Our university is committed to its world-class researchers and to the people who benefit from their ground-breaking research.
The University of Ottawa is proud of its accomplishments resulting from faculty working together with students, postdoctoral fellows, research associates, and support staff. Our successes in research are indeed pivotal to our successes as a university, whether the research is basic or applied, of intrinsic value, or of commercial importance.
