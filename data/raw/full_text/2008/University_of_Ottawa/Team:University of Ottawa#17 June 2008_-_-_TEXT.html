Dan, Matt
We performed a miniprep for the Collins plasmids: S1, D12, T123 followed by a digestion of each plasmid using Bgl and NcoI.
TB plasmid was glycerol stocked however SA/SB and DA/DB plasmids were unsuccessful upon running the gel - we had extra bands present on the gel.
A digestion of the 600 plasmid using BgI, PacI and AatII was also performed and was successful upon reading the gel.
