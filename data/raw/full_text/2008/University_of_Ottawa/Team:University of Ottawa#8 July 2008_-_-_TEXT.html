Digestion
Digestion was performed again with PstI for PTP2 ligation product. This time longer digestion period with more enzyme was used.
Gel results still unsuccessful, I am going to try using EcoRI on Thursday instead of PstI.
Digestion was performed with Atcre using EagI, a gel extraction will then be performed tomorrow with the digestion product.
Master Plates
Master plates were made for the By4724 int DQ232597/8 so that a Quick genomic DNA isolation can be performed tomorrow.
