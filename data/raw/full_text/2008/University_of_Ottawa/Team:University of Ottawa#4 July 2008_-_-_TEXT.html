Miniprep
Inoculation turned out great from the night before.
A miniprep was performed on all the plasmids from the inoculation yesterday. The absorbance was measured and all samples had really high concentration's of DNA.
Digestion
Performed a restriction digest of all the samples taken from the miniprep for the PTP2 ligation product. PSTI was used as the restriction enzyme.
