Dan and Matt
Performed digestion of Tet plasmids
T123, D12, and S1 were all digested with NcoI and EcoRV, results appeared to be as expected however EcoRI should have been used instead of EcoRV in order to obtain a better resolution
Innoculated BY4741
BY4741 was innoculated in 5 mL of 2xYPD + 1/10 20% glucose. However the BY4741 strain was 2 months old.
Chris
Too few colonies grew on incubated plates; linear AtCRE may not have ligated properly
Comparison of Ligated and Unligated Samples
To determine of recircularisation worked, the ligated and unligated samples of AtCRE were run on a 0.8% gel for about 50 minutes. A difference was expected between the two samples when visualised.
Neither sample turned up on the gel; concentrations of both were too low. This prompted a re-examination of AtCRE concentrations by absorbance.
The concentrations of both samples were incredibly low; ligation did not work.
Starting Over
Digested AtCRE: 37 uL DNA, 1 uL EagI, 5 uL Buffer 3, 7 uL water.
