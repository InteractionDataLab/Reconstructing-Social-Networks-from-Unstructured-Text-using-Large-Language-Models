Dan, Matt
Digestion
We decided to use different enzymes - Bam HI + EcoRI for 8/7 and xhoI for 0/1.
Gel Results
Gel was unsuccessful for 1A but results for other plasmids worked well.
Miniprep
We decided to choose 6 new colonies for the 1A plasmid and perform a miniprep on them.
Colonies were then inoculated using LB + Amp solution and left overnight.
Glycerol Stock
Glycerol Stock was performed for plasmids 7/8 and 0.
