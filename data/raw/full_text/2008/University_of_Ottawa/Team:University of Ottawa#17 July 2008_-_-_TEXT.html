Chris
Purification of AtCRE
used PCR clean up kit to purify AtCRE sample
Tranformation of Competent Cells
followed transformation of competent cells protocol to insert AtCRE plasmid into preprepared competent E. coli cells.
allowed cells to incubate overnight at 37 C
Matt
Ligation
As suggested by Dan the ligation was spiked with 1 ul ATP.
I then performed a PCR cleanup of the Ligation product in order to purify it for transformation into competent cells.
Transformation
A transformation was performed on PTP2 ligation product - I then left the streaked plates to incubate for tomorrow.
A glycerol stock was finally made of the BY4642 yeast strain int. DQ232597.
Dan
Gel of construct 1 after ligation
Gel was unsucessful, the wrong primers were used for PCR amplification.
Ligation seemed to work very efficiently, digesting in 50 uL with the new ClaI enzyme is working very well.
Digestions
Three digestions were performed 1+T, 1+T (higher concentration of vector and insert), and just the vector
Ligations
Three above plasmids were ligated overnight
Tammy
Plasmid DNA Isolation
XL10 Competent E.Coli cells transformed with pDR197::AtCKX2 were lysed and plasmid DNA was isolated using the Sigma-Aldrich kit.
Average DNA concentration approximately 80 ng/μL
Digestion of isolated pDR197::AtCKX2
