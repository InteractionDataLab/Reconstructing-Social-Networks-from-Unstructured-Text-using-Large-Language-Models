Double-Check of AtCRE
Digested samples showing desired bands with EcoRI for one hour.
Ran against a water control and DQ2325601 digested with EcoRI for one and a half hours on a 1% gel at 80V
One of two samples still showed desired bands following double-check. This sample was streaked onto a master plate, which was incubated at 37 C overnight, and glycerol stocked in the -80 C fridge for further use.

Ligation Results
A gel was run after two hours for ligation of PTP2/pSSA42 - unsuccessful.
A gel was run with overnight ligation - vector and H2O controls were clean and ligation product band is slightly visible in 3:1 ratio. However there is auto ligation occuring with the vector.
PCR
Dan and I decided that the initial extraction of PTP2 after PCR yielded a product that was too concentrated to be properly extracted - so I am redoing the PCR amplification with elongation time raised to 1 min 15 sec and annealing temp raised to 58 C.
I will also spread the PTP2 amplification product over many different lanes on the gel so that it can be properly extracted.
Digestion
pSSA42 was redigested with BamHI and xhoI.

'Wet Ware
Worked a little bit on trying to get some wet ware tools working.
'Innoculation
Innoculated 6 colonies and a control
