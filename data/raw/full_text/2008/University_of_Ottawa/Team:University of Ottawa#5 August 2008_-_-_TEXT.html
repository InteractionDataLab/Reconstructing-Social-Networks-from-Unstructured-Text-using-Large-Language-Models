Today in the Lab
Chris
Inoculation control was contaminated; will reperform later today.
Digestion of Construct OA, OB and T Amp Product
In order to increase the scope of our microwave digestion experiment, I added the following samples for comparison purposes.
Sample
Condition
1'
5 sec. in microwave, 2 minutes on dry ice
2'
2x(5 sec. in/2 min. dry ice)
3'
10x(5 sec. in/2 min. dry ice)
Digestion was performed according to previous protocol, including denaturation at 80°C and addition of ligase+ ATP.
Ran all products on a 1% gel; however, did not run digestion products as a control and had to redo the experiment.

Incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes, followed by 20 minutes at 80°C to denature the enzymes
2. Ligation
Added 1μL each ligase and ATP to the digestion samples before subjecting them to the following conditions:

Digestion Products only
All samples stored at 4°C following ligation
Also: inoculated 5 samples each of Matt's 3:1 and 6:1 PTP2/PSSA42 construct for minipreparation tomorrow.
