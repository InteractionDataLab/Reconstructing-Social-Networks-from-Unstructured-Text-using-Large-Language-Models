Today in the Lab
Matt, Dan, Jon
Analyzed results from yesterday's electrophoresis of the 0/1 plasmids
Test tube A for the 0 plasmid was either contaminated or partially digested. Decided to redo the test to ensure accuracy, however this posed a problem because we are running low on the amount of DNA in the fridge.
Began miniprep of 0/1 and 7/8 plasmids
Mila showed us where to get the agar plates and how to do the miniprep.
We plated the bacteria and left them in the incubator at 37C overnight and will continue the miniprep tomorrow
General Project Developments
Matt, Dan, John, Kheira, Katy, Nezar, Radi
Held an informal meeting to discuss implementation details of our project.
Decided that before we start assembling components we should finalize our project design with Dr. Kaern and Cory. However we should start by trying to synthesize our own IP from bacteria.
