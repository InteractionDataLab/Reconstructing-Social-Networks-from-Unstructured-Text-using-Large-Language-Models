Results from the gel
Showed that PCR did not work
Source of problems can be from:
1. The sequence that we have on hand is not the plasmid that we have
To resolve this we will digest the plasmid with HindIII
2. The PCR is not working
We will run a PCR temperature gradient.
If the second test is inconclusive we will order new primers.
Digestion of 7/8 plasmids using HindIII'
Worked out as expected, there is a high probability that we have the correct plasmid
PCR gradient between 55 and 70 degrees C
Gel showed that there are very faint expected PCR products between ~56-60 degrees C
We will narrow our gradient and try the PCR optimization again, although we think that it is unlikely that there is a problem with the PCR because we are using the enhanced phusion enzyme.
