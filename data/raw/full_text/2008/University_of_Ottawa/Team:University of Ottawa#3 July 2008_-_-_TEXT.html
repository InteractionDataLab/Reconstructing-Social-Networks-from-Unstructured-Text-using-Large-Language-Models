Competent Cells
Ecoli integrated with ligation products were successful in growing overnight however Atcre did not show any signs of growth
The cells containing the ligation product will then be inoculated and left to incubate overnight for a miniprep tomorrow.
The Ecoli containing the dehydrogenase component failed to grow from streaking a plate yesterday,I will try and streak again today and then glycerol stock the remaining Ecoli.
Ligation
Atcre was ligated to circularize the plasmid and will be integrated into Ecoli again today.
Dan
Atcre integration
Plate had ~4 colonies so I decided to redo integration.
1,2,3,4 and S,D,T ligation
The concentration of these constructs was determined to be decent
A gel was run to verify the integrity of the constructs, S,D,T showed some contamination
1,2,3,4 did not show up on the gel for unknown reasons.
Dan and Matt
Integration
Atcre, and 1S 1D 1T 2S 2D 2T 3S 3D 3T 4S 4D 4T were integrated
