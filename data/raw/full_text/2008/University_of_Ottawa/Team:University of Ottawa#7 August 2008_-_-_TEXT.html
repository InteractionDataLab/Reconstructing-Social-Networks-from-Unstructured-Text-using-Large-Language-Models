Chris
Digestion and Ligation of OA, OB and T Amp Product
Digested all three according to previous digestion protocol (see August 5 post). Ran 7 samples--six ligations and one digestion products only. Incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes, followed by 20 minutes at 80°C to denature.
Spiked each tube with ligase and ATP then incubated at room temperature for around two hours.
Ran products on a 0.6% gel for 1.5 hours at 80V. Stained the gel in an Ethidium Bromide and TAE Buffer solution for 20 minutes.
Excised desired band and performed gel extraction. Stored at -20°C.
Matt
Absorbance was measured from the ten colonies miniprepped by Chris. I then digested each colony with PST1 to confirm.
All colonies were confirmed and successful.
Used SLN1 primers to amplify the PTP2/GAL10 casette overnight from two colonies chosen from the miniprep.
Dan
p1T miniprep confirmation
p1T was digested with HindIII for confirmation, I did not get the correct product :(
dehydrogenase construct
pSSB37 and pDR197(pure1) were both digested with SphI and HindIII
Master plates of pSSB37 and pDR197(pure1) were streaked
