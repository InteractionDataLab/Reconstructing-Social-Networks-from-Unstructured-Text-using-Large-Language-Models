PCR Amplification
F60, F61 primers used for PTP2 cassette. I also labelled all the primers we received that we will be using for the next few months.
I decided to use the Kaern Lab protocol for PCR Amplification.
The PTP2 PCR product was then run on a gel - gel results were as expected with 2275 size band.
Glycerol Stock
Glycerol stock of plasmids D12, S1, T123, pSS042 with LB + glycerol was performed.
Dan
Ran gel of pSSA42, S1, D12, T123 plasmids
This time the marker was added and expected results were obtained. SB, DA, TB, and 42B colonies were chosen for glycerol stock.
Cleaned out DNA box
Cleaned out all DNA that will not be used from our box
Our names are getting complicated so I am renaming our DNA using the following legend (all other DNA was discarded)

PCR amplification of S, D, T, 7 and 8
S, D, and T plasmids were PCR amplified overnight using primers F69 and F70
PCR program for 0&1 was: PHUSION
PCR program for S&D&T was: PHN1
The 0 and 1 plasmids were amplified according to the following chart: (Primer F66 is :Int TetR Repl F (*PstI) (B). primer F67 is Int GFP Repl F(*SphI) (A), and primer F68 is:Int SSRE R(*ClaI )
