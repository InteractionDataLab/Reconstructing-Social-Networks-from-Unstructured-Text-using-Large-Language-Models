All samples inactivated at 65°C for 20 minutes.
Ran the products on a 1% gel at 80V for 40 minutes.
No visible difference between: 5+ and 5-; and 15+ and 15-. 10- matches 1 hr better than 10+, which showed incomplete digestion. All samples other than 1 hr showed varying degrees of incomplete digestion.
Microwave protocol is therefore not useful for time frames tested. However, current digestion processes can be shortened from 1 hour to 15 minutes.

Deactivated at 80°C for 20 minutes
Added 1μL ligase and 1μL ATP to tubes.
Left one sample over the weekend to ligate, another for 5 seconds in the microwave, then to the 4°C fridge, and one for 10 seconds in the microwave then to the 4°C fridge.
Inoculated 5 samples each of Matt's 3:1 and 6:1 PTP2/PSSA42 construct for removal tomorrow by Corie.

Transformation
p1T(0A0B) and pSSA14 + 0B were transformed
Gel
Gel was run of p1T right after the first gel extraction and after digestion with ClaI and ligation
