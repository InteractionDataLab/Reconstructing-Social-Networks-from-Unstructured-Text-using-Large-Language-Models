Minipreparation and Confirmation of PTP2/PSSA42 samples
Control (tip only in LB+Amp) was clear
Followed miniprep protocol included in kit
Spilled one tube; concentration expected to be zero. Also, did not mix neutralisation solution as outlined in the protocol.
Measure absorbance of isolated DNA: all samples very low and poor purity.
Digested aliquots of all samples with PstI despite low concentrations. Expected bands (1246, 699, 5685) appeared on a 1% gel; however were faint and inconclusive.
While the gel was running, performed another miniprep of the same ten samples, following protocol exactly in order to increase DNA concentrations.
Continuation of Ligation Optimisation
Ran all products on a 1% gel for 40 minutes at 80V.
All ligations appeared exactly the same on the gel; future ligation protocol will be shortened from overnight to a minimum of six minutes.
