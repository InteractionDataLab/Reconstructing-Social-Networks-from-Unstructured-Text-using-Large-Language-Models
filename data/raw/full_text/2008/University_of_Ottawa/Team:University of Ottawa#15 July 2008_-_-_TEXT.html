Tammy
Transformation of XL10 Competent E. coli cells with pDR197:AtCKX2
1 uL Pure pDR197:AtCKX2
1 ul 1:10 dilution pDR197:AtCKX2
1 ul 1:100 dilution pDR197:AtCKX2
100 ul XL10 E.Coli per reaction
900 ul LB Broth per reaction
3 LB Ampicillin (50 ug/mL) Plates
Began Incubation of transformed cells at 1:50 pm.

Inoculation of 97 - BY4742 cells
I inoculated the 97 BY4742 cells once again for glycerol stock tomorrow
PCR confirmation
Second PCR confirmation with F58, F59 was performed and gave the correct band but also gave another weird band that I don't know what it is.
Digestion of PTP2
A digestion was performed on the PTP2 amplification product to create sticky ends using BamHI and xhoI and I left it in the PCR machine overnight.
Chris
Digestion of AtCRE
AtCRE was digested using EagI at 37 C for about one hour
the result was run on a 1% gel, which showed two bands, both of which were expected
Gel Extraction of AtCRE
the AtCRE was extracted from the gel using the gel extraction kit and protocol
unfortunately, the final AtCRE sample was vacuumed up with the other waste by accident
Digestion of AtCRE
AtCRE was digested again using the same protocols as above, except that it was run on the "digest and denature" program on the thermal cycler. It was left overnight.
Dan
Gel of overnight PCR
Sample 0B did not show up on the gel, and was thus considered unsuccessful. This information was coherent with results from the absorbance measurements.
PCR at 35 cycles
PCR reaction of 0B was run overnight at 35 cycles instead of 29.
