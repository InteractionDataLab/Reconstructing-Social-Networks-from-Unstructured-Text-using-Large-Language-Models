Matt
PTP2 Digestion
Ran two digestion's of the PTP2 in parallel with one another: AatII/NcoI, EcoRV/NcoI. Neither Gel gave proper band sizes.
PCR confirmation
PCR confirmation of 97 plasmid showed up nicely on the gel, confirming that the integration was a success.
Chris
Confirmation of AtCRE
ran the 1% gel at 80 V for about forty minutes
only primer bands showed after this time period
it was suggested that phusion polymerase may not have been added before PCR, so 1 uL of phusion was added to the samples and phusion PCR was re-initiated
following PCR, the results were run on a gel with the same results as above.
