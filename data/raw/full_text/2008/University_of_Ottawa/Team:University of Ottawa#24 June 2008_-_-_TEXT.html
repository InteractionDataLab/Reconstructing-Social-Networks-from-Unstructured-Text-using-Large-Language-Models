Genomic DNA extraction
Mila showed me how to do a genomic DNA extraction of the four YPH500 colonies.
Genomic DNA concentration of colony A was found to be 830.125 ng/ul  - that colony was then chosen for PCR amplification of the PTP2 cassette.
The PCR amplification will be performed tomorrow morning.
Dan
Miniprep
Performed a miniprep to obtain  pSSA42, S1, D12, and T123 plasmids.
Taking the absorbances of the DNA indicated good concentrations.
Digested the S1, D12 and T123 plasmids with NcoI and EcoRI
Digested pSSA42 with HindIII
Ran both plasmids on a gel and obtained expected results but forgot to add marker :(
Redigested plasmids overnight, will run gel again tomorrow
