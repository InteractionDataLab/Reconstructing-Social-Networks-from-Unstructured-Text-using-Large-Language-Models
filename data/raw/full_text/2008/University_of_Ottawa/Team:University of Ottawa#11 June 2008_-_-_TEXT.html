Gel Electrophoresis + PCR
Plasmids 7 + 8 were unsuccessful upon verifying with the Gel. The bands did not appear in the correct location.
We decided to redo these plasmids with the primers F50 + F51, perform PCR and run the Gel tommorrow morning .
Plasmids 0 + 1 turned out to be successful, tomorrow we will perform a DNA clean up with these plasmids. Mila is going to show us how to do this.
Tomorrow we also plan on performing a DNA clean up with Plasmids 7,8 if the Gel is successful.
