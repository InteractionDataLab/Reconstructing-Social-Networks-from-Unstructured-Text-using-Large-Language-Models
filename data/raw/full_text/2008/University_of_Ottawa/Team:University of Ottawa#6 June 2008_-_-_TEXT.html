Miniprep
Miniprep continued form yesterday with the 6 colonies chosen for the plasmid that did not work on the gel yesterday.
Upon determining concentrations of DNA, we had a few colonies with a very low concentration - C, D and H.
Digestion
A digestion was then performed for the six colonies using xhoI.
