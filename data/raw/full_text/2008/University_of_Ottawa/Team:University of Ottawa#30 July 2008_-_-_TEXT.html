PCR Confirmation
Ran all 5 PCR product samples on a 1% gel for 40 minutes at 80 V
Desired band appeared on gel; PCR amplification was successful.
Used PCR cleanup kit to purify samples
Measured absorbance of PTP2 samples
Digestion of PTP2
Digested PTP2 with BamHI and XhoI; ran 5 tubes in parallel. Incubated at 37 C for on hour. Ran one water control.
Used PCR cleanup kit to purify digestion products. Measured absorbance to determine concentration.
Concentrations too low for ligation.
Matt
Measured absorbance of pSSA42 gel extraction products from digestion.
Dan
Gel Extraction
T123 amplification product was run on a gel and extracted.
24 gel extraction were performed in total, care was taken to minimize UV exposure (samples were not exposed for longer than 20s)
Gel of extracted PCR amplification product
Expected bands were seen, the T123 is good to go.
0A and 0B absorbances
absorbances of 0A and 0B indicated very good concentrations
Ligation and digestion
Digestion (with SphI and PstI) of T123 0A and 0B were all performed and left overnight
