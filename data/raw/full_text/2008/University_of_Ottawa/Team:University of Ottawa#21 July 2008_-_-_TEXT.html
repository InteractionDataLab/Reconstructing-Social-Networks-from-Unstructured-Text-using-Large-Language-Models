Dan
Gel of sample 2T
For some odd reason all of the DNA stayed in the well... Could be some sort of salt contamination from NEB buffer 1, or a very large autoligation product. I will test the former by doing PCR cleanup and switching to ligation buffer and then run the gel again.
Digestion of 1A 0B and both S and D
The above DNA fragments were digested with PstI and SphI in Neb buffer 1, enzymes were denatured after an hour
PCR cleanup was performed on the digested products, eluted with 50 uL water.
Ligation
Ligation of the DNA obtained from PCR cleanup was run overnight at 16 C
Matt
Miniprep
I performed a miniprep of the inoculated PTP2 plasmids and yielded good concentrations for all samples.
I then proceeded to digest each sample with NcoI and run them on a gel for confirmation.
It appeared as though NcoI only cleaved at one site on the plasmid - linearizing the plasmid. I am going to try to  attempt another digestion with EcoRV/EagI which should give two definitive bands - if successful then I will PCR amplify  with SLN1 primers for integration into yeast.

Transformation of Competent Cells
Using ligated AtCRE that Dan prepared 22 July 2008, performed a transformation of competent cells according to protocol
Performed transformation on a single sample only, as success was not expected. Used LB plates with ampicillin. Incubated against a control plate with no e. coli.
Incubated overnight.
