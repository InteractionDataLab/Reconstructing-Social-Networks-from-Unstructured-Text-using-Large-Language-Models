PCR gel
The gel turned out well, S&D&T amplification products had some non specific binding, but there was enough separation to cut the good bands out and purify.
After PCR cleanup (for 0&1 amplification products) and gel extraction and cleanup (for S&D&T plasmids) absorbtion was measured in order to determine the concentration of the PCR products.
S&D&T amplification products showed low DNA concentration, however it is still within the usable range
Digestion
0 and 1 A and B  PCR products were digested with ClaI so that they could be ligated in various combinations
