PCR Amplification of PTP2
Began running experimentation alongside Matt to increase chances of success
Ran 5 samples, including two water controls as per Cory's request.
Master mix: 50 uL Buffer, 5 uL dNTP, 12.5 uL F60 and F61, 2.5 uL DNA (at 25 ng/uL), 142.5 uL water.
Digestion of PSSA42
Ran five samples and one water control
Per tube: 3 uL water, 3 uL Buffer 3, 3 uL BSA, 1.5 uL XhoI and BamHI, 16 uL DNA template.
Incubated at 37 C for one hour
PCR Cleanup
Used PCR cleanup kit to purify PTP2
Measured absorbance of resulting DNA samples. The concentrations were found to be very low; PCR did not work. It was later determined that DNA template was not added, by accident.
PCR Amplification of PTP2
Ran PCR with same constraints as previously. Let run overnight.
Tammy and Dan
0.8% Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of T123 PCR Products
Each PCR reaction tube (50 μL) was divided into 2 and ran on 2 separate wells to decrease DNA load and to ensure identification of appropriate band size
Agarose Gel Extraction
24 bands were cut from the gel using minimal UV exposure
6 gel bands were pooled into 1 column for a total of 4 aliquots of purified T123 DNA
Matt
Inoculation
Inoculation of pSSA42 turned out nicely, control was clean - performed a miniprep from inoculation.
Transformation
Plates of transformation in competent cells did not yield any colonies - control was clean.
Digestion
Digestion of pSSA42 was performed with BamHI + xhoI.
