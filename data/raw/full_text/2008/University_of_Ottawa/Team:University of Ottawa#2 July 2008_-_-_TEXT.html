We decided it was better just to try and integrate into competent cells and incubate overnight for tomorrow morning.
Transformation
The competent cells were transformed with the ligation product of all three samples and left overnight.The receptor component Atcre was also integrated into competent cells.
Dehydrogenase component
The dehydrogenase was received in the mail, I streaked the Ecoli containing the component to grow overnight in the incubator. Tomorrow we will inoculate for mini prep the following day.

PCR of pSSRE constucts
Turned out to be a disaster. Had nonspecific binding and >4 bands. We would be better of going back to the original gel extraction products.
Digestion
Now I am using the original gel extraction products (1,2,3,4) and
