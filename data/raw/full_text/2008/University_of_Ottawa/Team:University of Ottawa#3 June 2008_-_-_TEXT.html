Yesterday's electrophoresis
The electrophoresis indicated that the miniprep did not go as planned, as a result we will have to do it again. Note: We have to number the colonies that we are using for our miniprep because some may not be expressing the plasmid as well as others.
We also realized that me might have been using slightly too much DNA in our digestions. We made a calculator to help us determine the right amounts of enzyme, DNA and buffer to use. This should also improve the resolution of our gels.
New Miniprep
We begann our new miniprep and will make sure to number the colonies. We prepared the miniprep for each plasmid from two different colonies.
We left the bacteria to innoculate at 37C overnight at 250 rpm.
