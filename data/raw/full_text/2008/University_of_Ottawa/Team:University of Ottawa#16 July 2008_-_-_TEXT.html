Tammy
Innoculation of transformed X10 E.coli + pDR197::AtCKX2 in LB + AMP.
For each dilution (PURE, 1:10, 1:100), 2 colonies were chosen to innoculate in 3 ml LM + AMP.
Control is LB + AMP only.
Finished Innoculation at 3:oo pm
Chris
Gel Extraction of AtCRE
prepared a 0.8% gel and ran the AtCRE sample for 40 minutes at 90 V
expected bands appeared and the desired one was excised
gel extraction was performed on the excised sample successfully
Determining AtCRE Concentration
measured the absorbancy of AtCRE, resulting in invalid data. It was determined that the blank was performed incorrectly, such that the machine was not zeroed properly.
the absorbancy of AtCRE was remeasured using a new blank at a 1:10 dilution. The resulting absorbancy was 0.3113 at 260 nm, giving a concentration of about 150 ng/ul.
Ligation of AtCRE
AtCRE was ligated with 1 ul ligase, 1 ul ATP, 2 ul DNA template, 1 uL buffer and 5 ul water
the sample was incubated at 16 C overnight
Matt
Glycerol Stock
The BY4742 cells int 597/598 were inoculated once again for glycerol stock tomorrow - this time I sealed the tubes with the parafin.
Digestion
Digestion confirmation of PTP2 with NcoI after Gel extraction was successful with correct band sizes confirming that I have the PTP2 product.
A PCR cleanup was performed on the digestion product of PTP2 digested with BamHI + xhoI, concentrations were low  but not low enough that a ligation cannot be performed.
I still have some pSSA42 digestion product from last time the digestion was performed that I can use for this.
Ligation
A ligation was then performed using PTP2 insert in pSSA42 vector using 3:1 mol ratio - I decided to use a little more insert than suggested to ensure success of the reaction.
Dan was thinking it would probably be easier if the ligation was spiked tomorrow morning with more ATP.
Dan
Overnight PCR of 0B at 35 cycles
Was unsucessfull
PCR of 0B at 35 cycles
Was redone and did not work again,
My conclusion is that the higher primer concentration is inhibiting it.
