Gel from PCR optimization
Running Gel of PCR of 70-75 and 80-85 plasmids with a new temperature gradient of 55-61.
Gel results were unsuccessful - we still continue to get two unexpected bands present - the correct band size is slightly visible on the gel.
Inoculation
Inoculated Colins plasmids and YPH500
Glycerol stock will be done tomorrow for these plasmids.
