Dan
PCR amplification of T123
I wanted to do PCR amplification of 0A and 0B, however PCR blocks were full, I will do this tomorrow
6 tubes of PCR reaction were prepared for T123, hopefuly this will give me the amount of DNA that I need for a successful ligation.
Transformation of p2S and p2D
p2S and p2D were transformed in E. coli
Chris
Minipreparation of AtCRE
Used minprep kit and protocol to isolate AtCRE from inoculated cells.
Measured absorbance of resulting DNA samples to determine concentrations
Confirmation of AtCRE
Performed a digestion of AtCRE with EcoRI against a water control and a positive control (DQ2325601 digested with EcoRI)
Ran product on a 1% gel for 40 minutes at 80V
Two of six samples showed desired bands.
Matt
Ligation of PTP2 with pSSA42
Attempted another ligation of PTP2/pSSA42 this time with 1:1, 3:1, Vector with ligase, H2O, Vector without ligase.
