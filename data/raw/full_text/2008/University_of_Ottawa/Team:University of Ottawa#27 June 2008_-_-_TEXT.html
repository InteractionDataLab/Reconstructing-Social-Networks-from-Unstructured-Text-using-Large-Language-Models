Ligation
Ligation was performed on the digested 0 1 A B PCR products, new samples were created according to the following legend:
Components
New Name
0B + 0A
1
0B + 1A
2
1B + 0A
3
1B + 1A

Gel indicated that no ligation occured. There are several reasons for this:
1. We only have a 2 bp overhang
2.We are not using enough enzyme
3. We did not use enough buffer
Enough buffer was added and enzyme was doubled, left to react over the weekend
