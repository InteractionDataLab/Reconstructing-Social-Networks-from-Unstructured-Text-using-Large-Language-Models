PCR Amplification
Corey decided it would be best to start from the beginning and amplify the PTP2 out of Genomic DNA again. I redid the PCR and I am running it overnight.
Inoculation
97 plasmid was inoculated from master plate so that it can glycerol stocked for tomorrow.
PCR Confirmation
Corey wanted me to do another PCR confirmation of the 97 plasmid with primers F58,F59. Expecting a band size of 2200 for this PCR when I run it on a gel for tommorrow.
Chris
Digestion of AtCRE (again)
AtCRE was digested with EcoRI again for one hour at 37 C
the result was run on a 1% gel, resulting in five bands where only two were expected.
using Vector NTI, we figured out that the incorrect enzyme was used for the digestion; in fact, EagI should have been used instead.
Dan
PCR amplification of construct 1
The amplification product was run on a gel however no clear bands showed up on the kodac machine. However the correct band was seen on the cutting UV machine.
The band was extracted using the Sigma kit and eluted with water.
Absorbance measurements indicated that no DNA was obtained, next time elution solution at 65 C will be used
PCR amplification of 0A and 0B was run overnight.
