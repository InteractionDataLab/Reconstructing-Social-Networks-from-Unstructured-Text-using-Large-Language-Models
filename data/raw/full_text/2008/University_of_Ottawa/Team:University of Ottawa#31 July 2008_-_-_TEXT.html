Microwave Digestion Experiment
Following protocol outlined online, tested a microwave protocol to hasten digestion period.
Digested DQ232597 with HindIII. Ran five samples: 5 seconds in micro, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds in and 2 minutes out (four times), water control, water control 10 seconds in microwave and 2 minutes out, 1 hr traditional digest.
Denatured HindIII at 80 C for 20 minutes, then ran products on a gel.
Results promising; however, more experimentation needed to confirm validity of this protocol

Ligation
Another ligation of PTP2 insert with pSSA42 vector was performed with 3:1 ratio, 6:1 ratio, Vector with ligase, vector without ligase and H2O control.
2 hr ligation was unsucessful, overnight ligation was usccessful for both 3:1 and 6:1.
Transformation
Transformed ligation product into competent cells - 3 different plates -3:1, 6:1 and control.

Gel Confirmation
One gel was run for the confirmation of the ligation of constructs 0A 0B and T, this gel showed that the ligation was successful
Gel Extraction
The successful gel indicated that I could go forward and run all the samples on a gel for gel extraction (ran over 6 wells) and the correct bands were extracted.
Digestion
2 samples were created (one for gel confirmation and one for transformation), both were digested with ClaI
PCR cleanup
PCR cleanup of the digestion was performed in order to prevent salts from inhibiting gel electrophoresis.
Ligation
Ligation was run overnight in the thermocycler of pSSA140B and p1T(0A0B)
