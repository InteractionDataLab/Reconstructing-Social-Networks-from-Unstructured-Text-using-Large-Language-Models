Today in the lab
Dan
Gel of S&D&T PCR products
The bands I needed were on the gel, they were somewhat close to non specific binding bands, so I took extra caution when cutting them out.
After using the gel extraction kit the obtained concentrations were decent.
PCR amplification of S&D&T
Performed PCR on the S&D&T obtained products, if it works, It would be easy to obtain more DNA and would save the hassle of going back to step 1.
Atcre and construct 1 concentrations
Both these DNA fragments resulted in very low concentrations following gel extraction. Chris went ahead and used Atcre anyways. The concentration of construct 1 was too low to use.
Talked to Cory and realized that AgeI could be used instead of ClaI. That would solve our problem of performing ligation on a 2bp overhang.
We ordered new primers today for this.
Looking back
After Matt encountered problems with reduced enzymatic activity of restriction enzymes, I decided to redigest and reconfirm
Matt
PCR confirmation
Tested absorbance and Ran a PCR confirmation of IP producing cells (97 plasmid int. in BY4742 yeast strain) using both wild type BY4742 and H20 as control's.
Digestion of PTP2 Ligation Product
Another digestion of PTP2 was attempted using EcoRI - sadly I did not get the bands I needed, it seems the PTP2 was not correctly integrated into the Vector.
Chris
Ligation of AtCRE
ligated AtCRE with 1 uL T4 ligase, 5 uL buffer and 1 uL enzyme.
encountered issues with protocol and communication; standard ligation not exactly followed
denatured ligase at 65 C for 10 minutes
PCR Amplification of AtCRE
followed Phusion high fidelity PCR protocol
forgot to dilute primers tenfold
prepared a 1% gel for confirmation of AtCRE; ran out of time to run gel.
