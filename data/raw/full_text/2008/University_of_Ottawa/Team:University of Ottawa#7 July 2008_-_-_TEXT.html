Gel
A gel was run for the digestion on Friday but did not turn out correctly - the correct band sizes did not appear.
The same digestion was performed again, this time using a little more PstI enzyme. Gel results still gave incrrect band sizes.
Performing an inoculation again with new colonies chosen from plates.
