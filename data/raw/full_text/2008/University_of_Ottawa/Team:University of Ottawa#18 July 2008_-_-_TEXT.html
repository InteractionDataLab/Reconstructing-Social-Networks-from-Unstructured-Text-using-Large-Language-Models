PCR Amplification
A PCR Amplification was performed on 600/1 plasmids with integration primers so that yeast integration can be performed next week. Corey suggested it is better to make new stock of this PCR amplification product for integration.
Transformation
The transformation was a success with both plates streaked growing numerous colonies.
For miniprep on Monday, I think I will choose 5 colonies per plate.
An inoculation will be performed today into liquid media so that a miniprep can be performed.

PCR
PCR amplification of 0B and 1 A was performed today, absorbance measurements indicated decent concentrations
Digestion
1A 0B and T were pooled and digested with PstI and SphI as part of our new strategy for designing the constructs. It should help eliminate virtually all possible byproducts.
Ligation
Was performed overnight.
