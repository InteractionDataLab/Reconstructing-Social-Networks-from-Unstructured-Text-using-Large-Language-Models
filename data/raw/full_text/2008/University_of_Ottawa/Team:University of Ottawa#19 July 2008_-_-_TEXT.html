Ligation
Spiked my overnight ligation with 1 uL ATP and 1 uL enzyme.
Ligation of Atcre
Began ligation of Chris's Atcre component in ~50 uL reaction
Matt
Inoculation
Today I took out the inoculated bacteria from Friday and put them in the -4 fridge (PTP2). All of the bacteria grew and the control was clean.
I also inoculated both BY4742 WT and YPH500 WT for Katy for a Mass Spec test.
PCR
I also performed a PCR cleanup of the 600/01 plasmids after I confirmed them on a Gel. These plasmids will now be ready for integration next week.
