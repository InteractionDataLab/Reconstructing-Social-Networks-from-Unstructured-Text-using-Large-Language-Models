Components
Red light sensor
In the dark - EnvZ and OmpR are phosphorylated
With red light - EnvZ and OmpR are dephosphorylated
See Levskaya et al. Synthetic biology: engineering Escherichia coli to see ligh'. Nature (2005) vol. 438 (7067) pp. 441-2 for more detail
OmpF Promoter
Phosphorylated OmpR results in this promoter being repressed
Dephosphorylated OmpR results in this promoter being activated
See Rampersaud et al. The OmpR protein of Escherichia coli binds to sites in the ompF promoter region in a hierarchical manner determined by its degree of phosphorylation. J Biol Chem (1994) vol. 269 (17) pp. 12559-66 for more detail
Gene X/Y and Px/y)
Generic transcription factors that activate the corresponding promoter sequence
Candidate proteins/sequences being collected here
RiboLock and RiboKey
Riboswitch controls that prevent translation of a sequence with a ribolock unless the corresponding ribokey is also present
See Isaacs et al. Engineered riboregulators enable post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Nat Biotechnol (2004) vol. 22 (7) pp. 841-7 for more detail
Off X
As yet undetermined mechanism for switching off part 1
Could be riboswitch, transcription factor, or protein kinase/protease based
Must be self maintaining to keep part 1 off for entire cycle but further mechanisms (Off Y etc.) can be transient
GFP/RFP
Used as a reporter gene to determine what state the system is in (GFP = State 1, RFP = State 2)
Initial State
Initial State
Initially in the dark, therefore OmpR phosphorylated and OmpF repressed
First Pulse
First Pulse
Red light results in OmpR being dephosphorylated
Therefore transcription initiated at OmpF promoters
Gene Y transcript is locked off by RiboLock1 therefore no Gene Y is translated
Gene X is translated, which activates Px
Eventually...
First Steady State
Red light is switched off, therefore OmpF is repressed again
The activated Px produces more Gene X, the RiboKey1 and GFP
Therefore the system is in state 1 with state 2 prepared for activation on the next pulse of red light
Second Pulse
Second Pulse
Red light results in OmpR being dephosphorylated
Therefore transcription initiated at OmpF promoters
RiboKey1 is being produced, therefore RiboLock1 is opened and Gene Y can be translated
Gene Y activates Py which kickstarts the activation of part 2 and repression of part 1
Eventually...
Second Steady State
Red light is switched off, therefore OmpF is repressed again
The activated Py produces more Gene Y, RiboKey2, RFP and Off X
Off X repressed Px, switching off part 1
RiboKey 2 will open RiboLock 2 in part 3 (not shown)
RFP indicates that the system is in state 2 with state 3 (not shown) prepared for activation on the next pulse of red light
Extension
Each new part will require the following unique components
A Gene X/Px pairing
A RiboLock/RiboKey pairing
An Off component that will switch off the promoter for the previous part
