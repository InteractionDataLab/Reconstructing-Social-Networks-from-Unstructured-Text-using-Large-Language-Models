The University of Guelph's First iGEM Team
We are aggies, biologists, bioinformaticians, lab rats, engineers and extension workers that will strive from year to year to prove the concept that synthetic biology (as an important part of biotechnology) can change lives and improve life in our communities and around the world. Our backgrounds include microbiology, genetics, plant agriculture, bioinformatics, computing, international development and neural science.
