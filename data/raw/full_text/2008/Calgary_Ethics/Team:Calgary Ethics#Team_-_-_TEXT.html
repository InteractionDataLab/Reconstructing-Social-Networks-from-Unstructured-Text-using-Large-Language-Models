I am a third year Biomedical Science student of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Calgary. My background is in biology, genetics, bio and organic chemistry with a focus in Biomedical Research. My work in iGEM this summer has been a meaningful experience and involved learning  a lot more about what synthetic biology has to offer in medicine, environment, food and technology. As a Biomedical science student, I spend most of my time doing experiments in the lab and analyzing what went wrong and iGEM ethics added a very different touch to my academic background. I was inspired to join this group after taking a course in ethical issues in medical research and practice, where I learned about the vital role ethics plays from the very initiation of the planning/designing of these synthetic biological systems.   Besides school, I love spending time with my family, listen to music, play my guitar, spend time with my friends and volunteer.
I am very excited about going to MIT and present our findings!!!

I am entering my 2nd year as a Health and Society major in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at the University of Calgary. I have a passion for biology and an uninhibited interest in the operation and evolution of society.I joined the iGEM team for 2008 because I believe synthetic biology will drive many major social changes in the future, both locally and globally. The advancements that synthetic biology may offer, especially in medicine and environmental safety, have many ethical, social, legal and economic implications. I want to examine these issues and gain a better understanding of them as they must be considered before any innovation from the field of synthetic biology can be implemented in society.

I am in my second year at the University of Calgary as a Health and Society major. I joined iGem because I am a science fiction enthusiast and the idea of creating life from scratch immediately triggered my preconceived ideas of mad scientists and dystopia. While my perspectives on Synthetic biology have broadened and I am convinced of the positive effect this approach may have, I am sure many individuals across the globe share my previous ideas on biotechnology. Participating in the iGEM ethics project has given me a wealth of knowledge about a field I was practically unaware of and inspired me to share what I have learned and engage in active discussions with individuals that may be unaware of the direction of the field and the impact it could have on society and the environment.
