Synbio: The Next Generation
The High School Survey
To get a sense as to where the field of synthetic biology may be headed, we surveyed high school students enrolled in science and engineering summer programs at the University of Calgary. We asked them how much they knew about synthetic biology, what their thoughts were on its implications and whether or not they would like a unit on Synthetic Biology in their high school curriculum.
The Results

.5% (30) of the students had previously heard of Synthetic biology
Perceptions of Synthetic Biology:
"It is a big step towards a better world"
"The possibilities are endless"
"It may revolutionize the human lifestyle"
"It may be a cost-effective solution to many problems"
ETHICAL ISSUES:
"To create new life from scratch sounds unnaturally wrong"
"Scientists should not "play God"
"It may revolutionize the human lifestyle"
Should Synbio be used for non-therapeutic human enhancement?
Should a High School Curriculum Include a Unit on Synbio?
Yes 67.6 % (25)
No 24.3% (9)
Don't Know 8.1% (3)
Yes because:
Students might be interested in it
It is important for students to be aware of the latest technologies
Students should be exposed early to emerging technologies
Ethical issues specially should be discussed
I know very little about it
Limitations
It changes very rapidly. Curriculums would quickly become obsolete
It should be taught at a level that can be understood by high school students
No because:
The field is not fully developed or understood
It is too specialized a subject
It is a touchy subject and some people may be against it
CONCLUSIONS
A large portion of the students surveyed are interested in synthetic biology. They are also largely aware of potential legal, ethical and environmental ramifications of its application. A high school curriculum incorporating synthetic biology may be useful. However, since we only surveyed students in extracurricular science programs, we cannot assume that all high school students in Calgary would agree. Synthetic biology should likely be a part of advanced placement courses or more advanced high school biology courses. Further research is required to see how much the average high school student knows about synthetic biology and how they feel about it.
