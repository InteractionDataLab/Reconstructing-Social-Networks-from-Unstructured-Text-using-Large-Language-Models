Future Plans
We have received over 150 completed surveys from the Ogranic Consumers Association (OCA). We plan to continue working on analyzing these results and compare and contrast them to the other groups that have responded.
We plan to continue working with the Guelph iGEM team on their synthetic biology approach to vitamin A delivery in developing countries.
