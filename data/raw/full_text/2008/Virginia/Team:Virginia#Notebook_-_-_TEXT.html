A little history
The VGEM team was founded in 2007 by George McArthur, then a 3rd year Chemical Engineering major at The University of Virginia. In a few short months he recruited four fellow undergraduates and gathered support from various departments and offices at the University. Last year's team successfully competed in iGEM2007 and earned a silver medal! The team has been and will continue to be a very much student-driven endeavour with all-original project ideas. This makes the team very independent but it also poses challenges which other teams that are under the umbrella of an existing research effort often do not face. Succeeding in the face of a challenge is the best kind of success though and the VGEM team will continue to push forward and conduct great research in the future!
