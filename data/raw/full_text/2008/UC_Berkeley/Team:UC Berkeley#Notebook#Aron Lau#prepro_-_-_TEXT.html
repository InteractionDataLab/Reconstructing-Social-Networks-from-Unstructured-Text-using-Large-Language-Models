Prepro Sequences
Prepro sequences coded for amino acid sequences that target the proteins to the periplasm.  Four basic prepro sequences basic parts were made: ompTpp, pelBpp, phoApp, and lamBpp.  Testing the prepro involved making composite parts with a Pbad.prepro.phoA.terminator construction and the alkaline phosphatase assay .
