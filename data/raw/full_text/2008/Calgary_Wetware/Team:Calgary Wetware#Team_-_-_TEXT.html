What we did
The larger version of System #2 workflow can be seen under The Project .
Thane contributed enormously to System #2, envisioning how the system would be set up, reading a humongous amount of background material, and spending countless hours in the lab. He also made the workflow for System #2!
Kevin worked on System #1 for the summer. Although there were many setbacks (for what seemed) a simple setup, results were finally generated. Also put together the wiki.
Dave provided help setting up System #2 and his experience was invaluable in the weeks leading up to the iGEM Jamboree for finishing touches in areas of the project. His ideas also gave rise to the project at the beginning of the summer.
Kingsley worked with our two mutants of LuxO. He also helped elsewhere in the lab.
