Weekly Meetings
Over the summer, the three Calgary iGEM teams, Ethics, Software and Wetware, all gathered together on a weekly basis. Each team would provide an update on their progress, and one team a week would give a detailed presentation regarding their project. These sessions were invaluable regarding the feedback that was received, largely a result of the diversity of the teams. For example, when it came to questions of biological complexity in the evoGEM program by the Software team, the Wetware team was able to provide assistance. What also was beneficial about the meetings was presentation practice, generating new ideas, and generating an appreciation for the aspects of synthetic biology from other perspectives.
