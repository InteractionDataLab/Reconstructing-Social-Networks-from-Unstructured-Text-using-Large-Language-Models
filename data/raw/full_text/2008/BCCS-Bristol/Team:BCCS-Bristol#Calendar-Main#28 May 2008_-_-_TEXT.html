Summary
Due to exams and other commitments only a small turnout was possible. Need to make sure that once exams finished that times of meetings allow everyone to attend. Schedule for weekly meetings will be setup at next meeting.
It is important that everyone is aware of the deadlines and key dates for iGEM. This needs to be sent to whole team in e-mail and discussed at next meeting.
Funding is still in the processes of being finalised. Further details will be provided once available.
Unfortunately no one was able to attend the instructors meeting, however, as Mario has participlated before, and having contacted MIT it seems this will not be a problem.
Actions
(Everyone) Need to invite everyone to the Google group to discuss projects.
(Everyone) Wiki needs to be updated with current details and templates for team members.
(Everyone) Looks through the ideas document produced and think about new ones.
