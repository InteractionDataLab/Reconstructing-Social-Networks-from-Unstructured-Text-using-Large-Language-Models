Swimming agar assay with L-aspartic acid
This time, only 0.3 % agar plates were used. Two wells were made using the thick end of a 1000 µl pipette tip. In the left hole some aspartate solution was put and on the right some water (control). To half of the plates the solutions were added in the morning to allow chemotactic gradient to set up, to the second half the solutions were added immediately before the inoculation in the afternoon (arond 5 hours later). The E. coli MG1655 strain was inoculated three times on a line in the centre between the two holes and incubated overnight at the different temperatures: 25oC, 30oC and 37oC.
Today, the plates were photographed and measured. There was some significant movement more towards the aspartate (chemoattractant), but the difference should be more visible. Thus, various conditions should be tested during the next experiments.
Comparision of motility between E. coli MG1655 and MC1000
The agar plates were inoculated. Details on 15 July 2008 .
