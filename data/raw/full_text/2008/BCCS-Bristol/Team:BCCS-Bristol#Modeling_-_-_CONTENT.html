The reason for this is that in addition to the creation of synthetic genetic circuits to regulate the internal state of a cell, we require the cell to physically interact with the environment in such a way that by bringing a large number of them together, all following to same rules, emergent behaviours are exhibited - the ultimate outcome of the project. To do this it is necessary to take into consideration the movement (chemotaxis) and physical force exerted between large numbers of cells in an environment as well as other aspects such as chemical diffusion, fluid dynamics and individual cell states.
</P><P>For these reasons we will be developing two types of model, an internal representation of a single bacterium using differential equations, and a external representation of the system as a whole using computerised stochastic agents. This will allow us to gain a better understanding of the different aspects of the project in a manageable way. Once these models have been completed, in an attempt to combine the advantages of each, both will be combined to give a holistic view of the modelling from a single cell to the whole population.
</P><P>Both types of model will make heavy use of computing resources. We are looking to utilise MATLAB for tasks such as numerical integration and statistical analysis and Java for the development of a stochastic agent based framework that will allow us to simulate bacterial chemotaxis, physical interactions between bacteria/particles and chemical fields exhibiting diffusion. The simulation environment will form the majority of the modelling work and once we can incorporate the GRN dynamics within each bacterium (agent) we hope to be able to perform virtual experiments that mimic those in the wet lab.
</P><P>The major limitiation of this approach is that the simulation of huge numbers of bacteria requires huge amounts of computing power. This means that for any reasonably sized simulations we will have to seriously consider optimising our code to make most efficient use of local resources (e.g. multi-threading for multiple processor/core machines) and for larger simulations allow for execution on distributed computing architectures. With this in mind we are aiming to gain access to the <A href="http://www.acrc.bris.ac.uk/acrc/hpc.htm" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Blue Crystal</A> high performance computing cluster at the university to attempt some large scale simulations.

For a C<SUB>pMax</SUB> range of [0.1, 100] the qualitative behaviour of the GRN was the same, shown in Figure 1a for a C<SUB>pMax</SUB> value of 5 molecules per cell. Both GFP and LuxI proteins rise rapidly in the first hour, while CpxR and LuxI mRNA reaches a maximum after 60 minutes. The final LuxI mRNA concentration is low, causing the rate of increase in LuxI protein to slow towards the end of the simulation. In
contrast, both mRNA and protein concentrations of GFP continue to increase rapidly for the duration.
</P><P>Figure 1b shows how the initial C<SUB>pMax</SUB> value effects AHL output over time. The behaviour is seen to be asymptotic, tending to a final concentration after approximately 400 minutes. The relationship between C<SUB>pMax</SUB> and AHL appears to be non-linear, with a rapid increase seen between 0.1 and 1. After this point the rate seems to slows, reaching a maximum near 4300. The huge variability in output AHL, even when the initial C<SUB>pMax</SUB> value is only varied by a small amount, makes it difficult to estimate a realistic output for a single cell. Experimental
techniques would need to be used to refine the accuracy of these results and allow for an appropriate CpMax value to be chosen. Overall, the GRN exhibits the correct dynamics, giving a sizeable AHL production in the presence of a CpxR response.

over time. A delta input of size 50 was used and the concentration distribution calculated over
a 30 minute period. Figure 2 shows the distribution at 5 minute intervals. A value of 0.23 s<SUP>-1</SUP>
was selected for the diffusion co-efficient.
As we do not know the maximal expression level C<SUB>pMax</SUB> of the response regulator CpxR it
was difficult to estimate the rate that an individual cell would produce AHL. For this reason
we attempted to concentrate on understanding the distance over which a threshold value was
exceeded. The receiver GRN has been shown to be sensitive to low levels of AHL, see previous section, and so we assumed a large response would occur at concentrations of 3 and greater.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 2: Transport Results</B> - Concentration distribution over a 30 min period for an initial delta function input at 0 of 50</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reciever"> Reciever </SPAN></H4><P>For the receiver we wanted to understand how varying AHL concentration altered output of our
signalling protein mCherry. This relationship is shown in Figure 3b. Availability of any AHL
causes a large increase in mCherry output, however, the rate of increase decays exponentially.
Output increases very little once a concentration of 3 molecules per cell has been reached.
The internal dynamics of the receiver GRN is shown in Figure 3a for an input AHL
concentration of 3. From an initial starting condition with all other states at 0, the LuxR protein
can be seen to rise to a stable maximum concentration of 9 molecules per cell after 100 minutes.
The LuxR–AHL complex also appears to have asymptotic behaviour tending to a concentration
of approximately 40 molecules per cell. Production of mCherry protein occurs rapidly once
LuxR concentration reaches a suitable level after 30 minutes. As LuxR in a living cell would
be maintained at a high level due to the constitutive promoter, the response would normally
be much quicker. With microscopes able to register individual mCherry proteins, the large
response to small AHL increases means the GRN behaves as we require, producing a visible
signal quickly.

a simulation was created where 1000 bacteria were placed uniformly at random in an area of
size (100, 300) centred at the origin. A static chemotatic gradient was generated increasing in
the x direction and all distances were analysed using the average x component from x = 0. Each
simulation lasted 5 minutes and was run 300 times to allow for the distribution of movement
speeds to be approximated. For comparison, a control was also produced using the same
configuration, however, without a chemotactic gradient.
A time series plot of the distance travelled up the chemotatic gradient can be seen in Figure
4a. This perfectly illustrates that even though chemotaxis contains stochastic elements, the
bias in run length permits directed movement. Also, as we would expect the control shows an
average distance of 0 for the entire simulation.
To generate the probability distribution of movement speeds, each simulation run had a line
of best fit calculated using least squared error. This was taken to be approximately the speed of
movement up the gradient. These speeds were then plotted as a histogram to give the overall
distribution, shown in Figure 4b. Both histograms roughly show a normal distribution with
mean values of 1.2mms<SUP>-1</SUP> and 0mms<SUP>-1</SUP>, for with and without chemotatic gradient respectively.
The standard deviation of both is also similar, approximately 0.2mms<SUP>-1</SUP>.
These results confirm that our model is producing movement in the correct direction. To
further verify the accuracy of the movement speeds, it would have been useful to compare our
values to experimental results. The difficulty in measuring the individual locations of large
groups of bacteria made this task prohibitive, however, may be something that could be carried
out in the future.

how the average speed of particle movement was affected. Due to limited available time in running
the simulations, only 10 runs, of 10 minutes duration for each density could be performed
and the range of densities differed depending on the execution times of the simulations. For
example, some of the higher density directed movement simulations took 5 days to complete a
single run making multiple batches difficult. All densities were standardised by using the ratio
of bacteria and simulated environment areas. This allowed simulations with slightly differing
configurations to be compared without bias. Control simulations containing no chemotatic gradient for each rule type were also run and showed average speeds of approximately 0, even as bacteria density
increased. For this reason no further discussion of the control simulations will be made.
</P><P>Averaged results for different densities and rules are shown in Figure 5a. Large amounts
of variation are present for each rule, with co-ordination the only one giving positive speeds
for all data points. Standard deviations of the results gave values of 0.0226 for directed movement,
0.0203 for particle sensing, 0.0511 for co-ordination and 0.0140 for recruitment. Increased
variation is also present at lower densities. This is likely to have been caused by the number
of interactions between bacteria and particles being much less, allowing the random element of
bacteria chemotaxis to dominates the small bias in direction.
</P><P>To perform a comparison of efficiency between rules, we considered the scaling characteristics,
assuming a linear relationship between bacteria density and average particle speed. Taking
the results from each individual simulation run, we fitted a least squared error line of best fit
and took the gradient of this as the approximate particle speed. Another line of best fit was
then calculated using these approximations, leading to the overall average scaling law shown
in Figure 5b.
</P><P>The ordering of efficiencies seems to match what intuition would lead to. Particle sensing
performs the worse, most likely due to fact that bacteria will initially be performing a random
walk, making it equally probable that they will hit any point on a particle. As only half the
particle surface can impart a force in the required direction, the small bias in movement can
only take effect in half all collision events, reducing overall efficiency.
</P><P>Both short range co-ordination and directed movement produce very similar efficiencies.
This can be accounted for due to directed movement being an extreme case of co-ordination,
where the range fills the entire simulated environment. The reason for the similarity is likely
caused by the range used in the co-ordination simulations being large enough that densities
of bacteria moving towards the goal attractant are similar around the particle in both cases.
Bacteria moving randomly further away therefore, have little effect on the overall movement
speed.
</P><P>Long range recruitment produces what seems to be a huge improvement in efficiency. This
may be due to the increased density it produces near particles, however, compared to the
other rules the results have been generated from a very narrow range of densities. This means
predictions have had to be made over much greater density ratios. The major outstanding
question of this method is if the increased density only has beneficial effects. For example,
there may be a point where bacteria with bacteria interactions start to become a large factor,
influencing chemotaxis in a negative way. Further tests would need to be carried out to verify
this hypothesis.
</P><P>Due to the large variability in the underlying data, it is difficult to place any confidence on
the predictions of rule efficiency. To improve the accuracy of these results it would be necessary
to run much large sets of simulations over a wider range of densities, to ensure that the statistical
space is fully sampled. Even so, these preliminary studies do provide support, showing that
co-ordination with recruitment is likely to enable more efficient use of any available resources.

The number of bacteria ranged from 1 to 15 with a static chemotatic gradient increasing in the x direction. Each configuration was run 40 times to calculate average behaviour. A control was included which omitted the chemotatic gradient.
</P><P>Figures 6a &amp; 6b displays results from these simulations in terms of movement up the chemotatic
gradient for differing numbers of adhered bacteria, and for standard and control scenarios.
With a chemotatic gradient present it is evident that the bacteria are still able to carry out
chemotaxis, moving the particle in the correct direction. As the number of bacteria increases
so to does the average distance travelled by the particle. The rate of this increase is rapid for 1
to 5 bacteria, however, from 6 onwards the rate decreases significantly and ordering becoming
mixed.
</P><P>When investigating this feature, video output from the simulations was consulted. These
illustrated that as the number of bacteria increased, the movement of each bacterium became
further restricted. We speculate that this interference leads to a massive decrease in variability
of particle movement, with the resultant force becoming an average of the group and additional
bacteria having less of an impact on the total resultant force. This would lead to asymptotic type
behaviour as the number of bacteria increases and would account for the significant drop off in
particle movement. Figure 7 appears to support this showing the difference in average speed
reducing as number of bacteria increases. To verify this claim a much larger set of simulations
would need to be run to better understand the exact statistics of the systems. This was not
possible due to time constraints on the project.
</P><P>In both figures the control simulations, as expected, showed random movement about the
origin with average speed remaining near 0.
</P><P>One of the interesting side effects of adhesion is the increase in efficiency of particle movement
speed. With each bacterium exerting a force for a longer period, when compared to
collision events alone, the average speed is much greater. For example, the average speed of
movement with adhesion remains above 0.2mms<SUP>-1</SUP> even with only a single bacterium adhered,
while our recruitment method only reaches 0.14mms<SUP>-1</SUP> for a density where 30% of the area
is bacteria. By combining adhesion with our existing construction rules it may be possible to
improve performance even further.
