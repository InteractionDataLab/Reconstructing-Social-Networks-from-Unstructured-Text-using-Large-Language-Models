Swimming agar assay
We wanted to test different conditions for the swimming agar assay:
- different agar concentrations
- different incubation temperatures
- different inoculation depths
After an incubation overnight, we measured the diameter of the E. coli MG1655 swarms. Surprisingly, we observed two swarm layers: The lower one has a bigger diameter than the upper.
