Background
The Bristol Centre for Complexity Sciences (BCCS) is a new highly interdisciplinary centre for training and research funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC). It is a major collaboration across 4 faculties within the University of Bristol .
Both the BCCS and iGEM share an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving and a culture of communication between previously disparate scientific fields. Furthermore, the BCCS aims to nurture the next generation of scientists in complexity, fitting with iGEM's ethos of introducing undergraduates to cutting edge science. This year the team is made up of advisors and students from the BCCS, Engineering Mathematics, Biology, Biochemistry and Chemistry.
By taking part in iGEM the BCCS and Bristol University hopes to:
Build links between departments and people within and outside the university,
Demonstrate the effectiveness of such collaborations,
Attempt to apply, where appropriate, techniques from the field of Complexity Science.
