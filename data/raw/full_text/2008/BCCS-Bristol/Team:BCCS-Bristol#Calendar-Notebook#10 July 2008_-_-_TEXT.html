Swimming agar assay with L-aspartate
The swimming agar experiment was repeated. Since the OD600 of the bacteria culture for the inoculation was too low, the plates were inoculated the next day. More concentrated aspartic acid solution was made by reacting with NaOH to make aspartic acid salt. A concentration up to 7 % was reached.  Also some salt was ordered to save doing this in future. Details under 14 July 2008 .
