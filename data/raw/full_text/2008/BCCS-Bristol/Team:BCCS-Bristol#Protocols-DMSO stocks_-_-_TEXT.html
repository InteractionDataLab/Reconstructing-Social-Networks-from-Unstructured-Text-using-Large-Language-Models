DMSO stocks
Make an overnight culture of the bacteria in LB broth (If the strain carries a resistance gene on a plasmid, you have to use LB with antibiotics)
Next morning, put 70 µl DMSO into a cryotube that you labelled with the strain’s name and the date
Add 930 µl overnight culture
Incubate immediately for 30 min on ice
Store the DMSO culture in the -80°C freezer
In the evening (or in one of the following days), make a streak out of the stock to see whether the bacteria are ok
