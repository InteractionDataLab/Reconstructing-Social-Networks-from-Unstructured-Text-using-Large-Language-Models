MG1655
Values come from the University of Alberta’s datasheet on MG1655, produced to aid modelling. There is variability in size between strains - for instance, AW405 length varies between 1.5±0.2μm. But University of Alberta datasheet is specifically for MG1655.

Swimming Speed
50μms-1
MG1655
University Alberta's datasheet gives 50μms-1. However, Swimming speed is affected by:
Viscosity (as viscosity increases the speed increases to some maximum, then decreases as the viscosity increases further. E.coli (strain:KL227 of length: 1.0μm and diameter: 0.5μm) maximum speed occurs at viscosity 8cp.
Temperature
Culture medium
Vary strain to strain.
Experimental methods
Various papers give different speeds for E. coli (most papers provide information on AW405 with a speed of ~20μms-1). The speed itself is nearly uniform during the run. The wet lab may need to measure this experimentally as we are unaware of the conditions that the speed for MG1655 was obtained. Alberta's value is higher than other values, but this probably because MG1655 is a motile strain.

Aspartate concentration detected by E. coli
Over ~5 orders of magnitude, 10nM up to 10mM. Can detect changes of as little as ~0.1%
N/A
E. coli detect small changes in concentration of 0.1% via temporal comparisons (4s) over a large range ( 10-8 to 10-3 ). Most computer simulations of chemotaxis are based on experimentally determined rates and concentrations. As a result they predict that the minimum detectable concentration of Aspartate is at ~200 nM. Experiments performed by Segall et al. in 1986, exposed tethered E. coli cells to iontophoretically delivered quantities of chemoattractant. These experiments indicated that a change in receptor occupancy of as little as 1/600 could produce an detectable change in swimming behaviour. With a Kd of 1 µM, this corresponds to a minimum detectable concentration of about 2 nM Aspartate. Wild type E. coli cells can detect <10nM of Asp and respond to Asp concentrations of upto 1mM,(responding to over ~5 orders of magnitude). M)
Competitive and Cooperative Interactions in Receptor Signalling Complexes
Temporal comparison of chemotactic gradient
4 seconds
N/A
The past second has positive weighting, the previous 3 seconds have negative weighting. E coli compares past and present concentrations by comparing the average occupancy of the receptors over the 4s. Models reflecting this system have been developed by Segall et al and Schnitzer, cells compare their average receptor occupancy between 4 and 1 s ago  c1-4 to the average receptor occupancy during the last second  c0-1 . Hence b= c0-1 -  c1-4 .   If b>0, the cell reduces the tumbling rate to Ttumbling from the ambient value T0 , 1s-1 e.g. b>0 don't tumble. b< 0, tumble at a rate of 1s-1

AW405
The tumble angle appears not to be dependant on the concentration gradient of chemoattractants/repellents. Nor is there correlation between the length of the run and the change in direction. The program uses a gamma distribution that fits the data collected by Berg and Brown. Several groups though, have observed that the tumble angle is not noramlly distributed but suggest that non-normality was only due to the experimental methods used e.g. in the capillary tube. Tumbling can cause a change in direction when as few as one flagella moves out of the bundle.

Tumble angle direction
Bidirectional
AW405
Personal communication with Howard Berg. 'The direction is random, more or less, but there is a slight forward bias. It varies from tumble to tumble.  The turn-angle distribution peaks at 68° rather than 90°. Tumbles turn out to be more complex than believed in 1972.  Motors switch independently, and a tumble can occur if one or just a few motors change their directions of rotation.  Tumbles are short, as judged by the tracking microscope, because they involve filament physics rather than motor physics:  a transformation in polymorphic form, following motor reversal, from normal to semi-coiled.  See  Darnton, N.C., Turner, L., Rojevsky, S. and Berg, H.C.  On torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli, J. Bacteriol. 189, 1756-1764 (2007).'

Drift during run

AW405
Drift was observed. It is what would be expected from rotational diffusion. (at 2.7cp at 32ºC drift was 23±23°). Rotational Brownian motion cause the cell to veer off course, so that in between tumbles the probability density function f of the swimming direction e evolves according to the Fokker-Planck equation.

Thrust
Down an Asp gradient 0.41pN, Up an Asp gradient 0.4387pN
AW405
Average thrust =0.41pN. In the Berg and Brown paper it states that the speed of the bacteria up an aspartate chemotactic gradient increases by 7%. Therefore in our model we shall use the following; thrust DOWN the Asp gradient =0.41pN, up the Asp gradient = 0.4387pN. Data was obtained from 32 AW405s, a strain which has provided the majority of our previous parameters but is not as motile as MG1655. The value was obtained at 23ºC in viscosity 0.93 and 3.07 cP for motility buffer and motility buffer with 0.18% methylcellulose, respectively. The standard deviation is not used as the speed is fixed at 50µm.s-1 . 0.57pN is the average thrust generated in strain HCB30 (a non tumbling strain). The thrust value was obtained when the imposed flow (U) U=0 at 23ºC. O.41pN was calculated using the resistance force theory treating the flagellar bundle as a single filament. The body was assumed to be prolate elipsoid using values roughly similar to ours, 2μm for length and 0.86μm for diameter.

Viscosity
Viscosity of water is 1.002cP at 20°C
N/A
At present the medium being used by the lab is still be discussed. Currently though the medium most resembles water and therefore the water's viscosity value can be used. This allows us to assume that the medium is Newtonian (dilute aqueous medium that doesn’t contain long unbranched molecules such as methylcellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone. Note that methlycellulose does not alter the run and tumble statistics, only bundle and motor rotation rates are affected by the addition of methylcellulose). If agar were to be used then the medium would be Non-Newtonian. Even though it would be Non- Newtonian John Hogan in passing said that we could assume it is Newtonian.
