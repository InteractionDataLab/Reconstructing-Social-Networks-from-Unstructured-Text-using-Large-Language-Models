Swimming agar assay
The experiment from 21 July 2008 was repeated. The aspartate solution was added eigth hours before the inoculation. The Results for showed that both strains were actually repelled by aspartate, possibly because the concentration was too high. Aspartate is the well on the right, and the control (water) is on the left.

BioBrick Transformation
The cells transformed with BioBrick were grown on ampicillin plates as if transformed are able to do so, however there was no growth of bacteria except when pUC19 was used. This highlights some problems with the DNA and not the actual transformation. The experiment was repeated with larger amounts of TE buffer around spot and with a different BioBrick. Results see weekly summary.
Bead experiment 1
The bead we had focused on overnight (see 22 July 2008 ) had gone!! There were observed lots of beads clumping together, areas of dead/non-motile bacteria and also filamentous bacteria (possible conaminant). There were also areas of still motile bacteria.  The bacteria had travelled 40 % of way across bridge, thus a smaller bridge was suggested.
