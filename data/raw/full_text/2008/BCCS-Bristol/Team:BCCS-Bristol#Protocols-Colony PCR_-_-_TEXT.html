Colony PCR
Components of the PCR Mix:
Template DNA: Colonies of a transformation plate
Primers: for BioBricks the primers VF2 (forward) and VR (reverse) are used
Master Mix (MM): “Taq 2x Master Mix” from NEB # M0270L
PCR-Mix for one reaction (20 µl):
Volume
Component
10 µl
MM
9.6 µl
sterile water
0.2 µl
forward primer (100 µM)
0.2 µl
reverse primer (100 µM)
Prepare additionally to the number of colonies you want to test one reaction for the negative control and one reaction as reserve since it might be not enough solution in the end!
PCR instructions:
Touch with a pipette tip the colony on the plate and try to get as much bacteria as possible
Touch now the bottom of a PCR reaction tube and turn the tip several times
Take this tip and make a small streak out on a plate (LB + antibiotics) and incubate the plate at 37°C during a day or overnight
Mix primers and water
When everything is ready, take the MM out of the fridge, add it to the primers and the water and bring the MM as soon as possible back into the fridge
Mix the PCR mix and give 20 µl in each PCR reaction tube (either using a new tip or ensure that you don’t get in contact with any DNA)
Close the tubes properly, mix them gently with the vortexer and spin them shortly down
Start the PCR
PCR programme:
Initial denaturation
95°C
5 min (if it’s not a colony PCR, take only 2 min)
Denaturation
95°C
30 s
Annealing
55°C*
30s
Extension
68°C
1 min/1 kb fragment length
Final extension
68°C
2 min
* or the appropriate temperature for the primers
