Comparision of motility between E. coli MG1655 and MC1000 (3rd attempt)
The experiment (compare 15 July 2008 and 16 July 2008 ) was repeated with sightly different conditions. This time, there were no antibiotics in the agar for the motility comparison between the two strains and the bacteria were inoculated in a well made by a puncher.  Results of motility comparison showed that MG1655 had greater motility than MC1000, this was still not at all what we expected.
Miscellaneous
Some plates were made.
Some broth was innoculated for an overnight culture to measure the growth curve of MC1000 and MG1655 tomorrow.
