Resuspending Primers
Before resuspending the primers, they need to be ordered. Giving a name to the primer, start with “iGEM” (e.g. iGEM_VF2). Collect the data about the primer (sequence, Tm , concentration…) in the lab book and on the N-drive in the “primers”-folder.
The primers were lyophilized before sending. To resuspend the primers, distilled water is added to a concentration of 100 μM. The right amount of water to be added is denoted on the sheet that was send with the primers. Keep these sheets in the black folder.
After adding the water, vortex the tube and let it incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature to dissolve the DNA. Vortex again and decant several μl in another tube for normal usage. Never use the original tube for preparing PCRs!!! Store the primers in the freezer.
