Comparision of motility between E. coli MG1655 and MC1000 (2nd attempt)
The motility comparison experiment ( 15 July 2008 ) was repeated, but this time only the plates for MC1000 contained streptomycin. None of the 0.5% agar showed growth. Overall MG1655 swarms were possibly slightly larger than MC1000 (in Cambridge 06' MC1000 had much greater motility than MG1655). The growth/motility of MC1000 might be disturbed because, in contrast to MG1655, the bacteria had to deal with an antibiotic. Thus, the experiment will be repeated without any antibiotics in the agar.
Chambers for bacteria-moving-bead assay
The dye plates were observed: They had dried out somewhat overnight, however the dyes had mixed well. The experiment was carried out again with whatman paper soaked in water in 15 cm petri dishes to make a humid environment. This time swimming medium (see table below) was also used instead of the 0.1% agar used before as this may be more like what we use in the final experiment.
