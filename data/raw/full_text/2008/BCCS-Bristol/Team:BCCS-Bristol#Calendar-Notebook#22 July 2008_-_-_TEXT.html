Bead experiment 1
It was started using the beads, aspartate and bacteria in 0.3 % agar within the glass slide chambers. One bead was focused under the microscope; it didn't move after 30 minutes probably due to the observation that the bacteria were in the bottom layer and the beads on top of the motility medium in didn`t seem to get in contact. The chamber was left under the microscope overnight (results see 23 July 2008 ).
BioBrick Transformation
Carried on with biobrick transformation of the GFP generator . The DNA was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells along with pUC19 as a control using chemical competent cells and heat shock.
Swimming agar assay
The chemotaxis experiment was continued, set up gradient over 8 hours of diffusion and innoculated with both MC1000 and MG1655 in agar in wells as before ( 21 July 2008 ).
