Submitted Bio-Bricks
BBa_K135000
This BioBrick contains pCpxR, a promoter which is responsive to phosphorylated CpxR (CpxR-P). Upon adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces, the CpxRA two-component system is activated. The inner membrane histidine kinase CpxA phosphorylates CpxR which then becomes active and regulates a number of target genes. This promoter is therefore sensitive to adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces.
BBa_K135001
In this part, the CpxR-P responsive promoter pCpxR is fused to the BioBrick BBa_E0840 which encodes GFP. Thus, GFP is expressed after binding to hydrophobic surfaces (see also BBa_K135000 for further explanations).
