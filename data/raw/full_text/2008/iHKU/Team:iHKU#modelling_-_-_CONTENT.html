Cell Growth</P><P class="style26">In the cell growth term, we  considered the growth rate was related to nutrient concentration. When the  nutrient was consumed by the cell, the grow rate of the cell would decrease  (<A href="#F7">Fig. 7</A>). There was a maximum growth rate <EM>γ</EM>0,  when the nutrient was rich. The parameter <EM>κ </EM>described the sharp of this curve(<A href="#F7">Fig. 7</A>). The larger <EM>κ</EM> gave us more smooth increasing curve. And we made an assumption  that one unit of nutrient would change to cell number with a ratio α. Also in  the initial condition, the nutrient concentration ni can influence  the patterns. Therefore, the effects of all the four parameters were studied in  our model.</P><P class="style26">Above reuslts indicated that, the  faster cell growth (larger <EM>γ0 </EM>and  smaller doubling time) formed a smaller and a little more unclear ring pattern.  And the inner ring diameter would become a litter more large when the growth  rate increased. </P><P class="style26">From  above figures, it was found that the initial nutrient concentration ni had  little influence to the pattern, especially when it was large. The only effect  we observed was that smaller initial nutrient concentration ni  made the ring slightly wider and more clear.</P><P class="style26">Here,  the value of <EM>κ </EM>was related to the  initial nutrient concentration ni. When initial nutrient  concentration ni was fixed, a smaller <EM>κ </EM>parameter gave us the similar results with that of faster cell  growth. </P><P>When  we increased the value of <EM>k</EM>, the  patterns did not change a lot, but only became a little more clearly.</P><P>In conclusion, the simulation  results showed that the parameters of maximum growth rate <EM>γ0 </EM>and <EM>κ</EM> had a more important role on the ring-like pattern.
