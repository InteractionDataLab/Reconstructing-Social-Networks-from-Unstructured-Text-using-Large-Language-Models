The Legend
"It all began with the forming of the magic  Coli rings. Three were given to the eleven Coli Kings, noblest and fairest of  all Coli-beings. Seven were given to the dwarf Colis, great miners who live in  there Halls of Agar. And nine, nine rings were given to Mortal Colis, who above  all desire power. But they were all of them deceived, for the Dark Coli Lord in  secret formed a master Coli ring! One ring rule them all. One by one the Colis  fell into the control of Dark Coli Lord. But there were some who resisted it.  In a great battle the Dark Coli Lord was ultimately defeated and the Coli rings  were lost. Time passes by, history becomes legend, legend becomes myth. When  the master Coli ring had passed out from almost all knowledge, it was then  picked up by someone who the Colis would never have expected: a group of human  from HKU!
The Coli ring itself was a book of history.  In it the human learnt about the great Coli rings of the past and that great  battle which had already faded into the years and nowhere else be found. It was  said that those who are able to collect the entire set of magic Coli rings can  fulfill any hopes that they wish. Influenced by the magic of the master Coli  ring, the human and his fellow set out to search for the rest magic Coli  rings…… "

Abstract
The ability of  living organisms to form patterns is an untapped resource for synthetic  biology. The  HKU iGEM2008 team aims to generate unique patterns by  rewiring the genetic circuitry controlling cell motility. Specifically, E. coli cells are programmed to  autonomously regulate their movement by sensing local cell density. Interesting patterns are  formed by two types of newly engineered cells. The high cell-density  motility-off cells spread outwards and spontaneously form a distinctive ring of  low cell density surrounded by rings of high cell density whilst the high  cell-density motility-on cells form a Fuji-mountain-like structure. Moreover,  we build a  theoretical model that satisfactorily fits our current experimental data, and  also predicts some parameters which may significantly affect the ring  formation. The study of this self-organized spatial distribution of cells helps  us to understand principles underlying the formation of natural biological  patterns, and synthetic non-natural patterns have various potential applied  uses
 
Overview
iGEM2008 iHKU team aims to deliver  you the most brilliant project this year. We come from departments of Biochemistry,  Bioinformatics, Physics, and Chemistry. With different backgrounds and modalities  of thought, we complement each other in developing new ideas, and in following  wet/dry lab work ( Team ).
Pattern  formation is one of the most common yet fascinating biological phenomena  happening in our daily lives, though for centuries, biologists, physicists and  mathematicians have struggled to understand its nature. How do highly ordered  patterns arise from a few living cells? How can our hands, our eyes, our bones  form their shape with such an extremely low mistake rate? This question is fascinating  but crucial. Bacteria use their flagella to move around. To generate a  recognizable and stable pattern, bacterial motility must be controlled and  coordinated. This can be accomplished by designing a genetic circuits coupling  bacterial quorum sensing system and genes controlling mobility. There are  several key genes responsible for the movement of flagella, two of them are cheY and cheZ. CheY protein has two forms: its phosphorylated form makes  flagella rotate clockwise and the cell will tumble; its dephosphorylated form  makes flagella rotate counterclockwise and the cell will be driven straight in  one direction (run). CheZ protein can help the progress of dephosphorylation of  protein cheY.
By rewiring the  genetic circuitry controlling cell motility, we aim to generate unique patterns  ( Design ). First, we applied the method of Recombineering  to delete cheZ gene in chromosome of  wild type E.coli strain, MG1655 ( Protocols ). And then, a series of biobricks and strains  were successfully constructed ( Plasmids and strains ).  As expected, fantastic patterns were fortunately observed ( Results ),  including Fuji-mount like and ring-like pattern. Since the ring-like pattern is  so charming, our rest work mainly focused on the characterization and modeling  of this pattern. The modeling…. ( Modeling ). Modeling  and experimental data indicated some factors might significantly affect the  development of ring-like pattern. By measuring these factors, we provided not  only solid data to support our hypothesis of modeling, but values of parameters  to maturate it ( Results ).? As a result, it’s surprising that we achieve  two-ring pattern by slightly tuning the genetic circuitry ( Results ).
During the  experiments, we have encountered uncountable difficulties. To overcame them, we  have created several NOVEL protocols, software, and devices with the help of  our knowledge from different fields, such as “growth curve on agar plate” ( Protocols ), “movie taker” , and “reflection spectrophotometer” ( Novel devices ).  We believe more researchers will benefit from our inventions.
Last but not  least, in this project, we created 15 biobricks and characterized 1 existed  biobrick ( Characterization ), which are considered to  be helpful to coming iGEM competitions and the study of synthetic biology.
Everybody of us cherish  this invaluable opportunity to work together to improve communication and complementarity,  and finally to fulfill our dream in iGEM2008!
