Cell Movement in Microscopic and Macroscopic Aspect
Basically, we considered the movement of a cell  as a process of random walk, since an individual E.coli cell was always in the states between moving and tumbling  (Fig.1).Similar to Brownian particles, the random walk of E.coli followed the Einstein-Smoluchowski theory [ 1 ].

and cell random walk(right)
Firstly, for the one dimension of random  walk, let x (t) denote the position of an E.coli cell at time t, given that its position coincided with the point x=0 at time t=0. And we assumed an E.coli cell moves an average distance l—in  either the positive or negative direction of the x-axis—each step (during a time (τ) between two tumbling states). The probability that the cell was  found at the point x at time t was now equal to the probability that,  in a series of n (=t/τ)  successive moving steps, the cell made m more steps in the positive direction  of the axis than in the negative direction. The desired probability was given by  the binomial expression [ 1, 2 ]
where
,
v= l/τ was the average speed of the cell movement, and f=1/τ was the tumbling  frequency of E.coli.
In two dimensions, the square of the distance  from the origin to the point (x, y) was r2=x2+y2; therefore
For a macroscopic view, D was defined as the diffusion coefficient. Normally, as the  swimming speed of E.coli is about 20um/s and the tumbling frequency is about 1 Hz,  the diffusion coefficient is about 200um2/s [ 3 ].

Front propagation for cell growth
If we only considered the diffusion effect and  growth effect of the cell culture, it came up with the model Fisher-Kolmogorov  equation which was firstly developed by R. A. Fisher and A. N. Kolmogorov [ 4 ].
where ρ was the cell density, D was the diffusion coefficient, γ0 was growth rate, ρs was saturation density.
Here, due to the symmetry, we investigated  equation (4) in case of cylindrical domains with u depending only on radius.  Numerical study with an initially condition of  Gaussian function                                                                      as Fig.2 can  give a solution shown in Fig.2, while analytical solution can refer to  reference [ 5 ]. Based on the solution, it was found that the speed of the front  propagation of the pattern was proportional to the square root of the product of  diffusion coefficient D and growth rate γ. As this migration speeds of the cell pattern at  different cheZ expression levels can  be obtained from experiments, and the growth rate was also measured, the  diffusion coefficient D at different cheZ expression levels were also known  then. And the cell density can be transformed to the brightness that we observed  in the experiments (see the brightness model part) , the quantity ρ can be compared with the experiments. Therefore, each  quantity in equation (4) can be compared with the experiments.
If we  looked at the wild type E.coli which  only had random walk and growth, the equation (4) was successful to describe its behavior. As shown in Fig.2, a droplet of wild type E.coli in the center of the plate will  from a round expanding pattern. And most regions in this pattern except for  some near in boundary seems to be uniform, which was the same as the  result of the model (Fig.2).

Density Dependent Motility
Fig. 3 Designed genetic circuit
In experiments, we designed a circuit  that the cell motility was repressed by cell density ρ. When the cell density ρ was high, the  diffusion coefficient D became small.  Therefore, the fisher’s equation as equation (4) was not valid  in this  case any more.
To  order to be simplified, we firstly considered  the one dimension problem again. We assumed the  cell density at point x was ρ(x) at time t. In a very short time τ, there would be two groups of cell at x moving into its nearby points x-δ, x+δ, due to the random walk. And the amount of cell in each group  were proportional to the product of D(ρ(x)) and ρ(x). Therefore,
And the function Dρ(ρ)  was a decrease  function. For a simplest case, we considered a Heaviside Function
Fig. 4 Heaviside Function Dρ(ρ)
The numerical simulations gave us the results  shown in Fig.5. The cell density showed a periodical-narrow-peak structure.  These peaks were what we wanted, as they produced some regions of low cell density,  though the whole pattern was not quite similar with that of experiments.

Full  Model of Density Dependent Motility
Fig. 6 The entire designed genetic circuit
Actually, in our genetic circuit, we transformed a  plasmid which can secrete AHL to environment (Fig.6). When the AHL density h of  environment was high, the AHL came into the cell. Then AHL combining with LuxR repressed the expression level of cheZ which controled the motility of E.coli. So it was necessary to take  account of the AHL effect.
First,  the AHL was synthesized by the E.coli cell at the rate λ. And the  degradation rate β of AHL whose half life is normally about 15 to 30 minutes. Considering the diffusion of AHL, we obtained
Fig. 7 The growth rate relates to nutrient concentration
For the nutrient, we made an assumption that  the amount of nutrient consumed were proportional to the amount of cell increasing.  Taking account of the nutrient diffusion, we had
where k was the ratio that nutrient converts to  cell mass.
We used several possible forms of function Dρ(h)(see Results Section2 ). The  results showed that if the cell diffusion coefficient decreases fast near the AHL  density threshold, the pattern came out as a multiple-ring one( Results Section2 (a),(e) ). On the contrary, there was only one-ring pattern.
Therefore, in order to to make this curve Dρ(h) decreasing sharply near the threshold, it followed a prediction that we can get a multiple-ring pattern by making an auto-activate genetic  circuit which the combination of LuxR and AHL can activate the expression level  of itself.

Furthermore, we did some  two-spot patterns which initially have two points of E.coli cell, so as to compare with the experiments culture ( Results Section3 ).

Results
We tried different parameters  in the model, to see how they influenced the pattern.
Generally, we can vary the  parameters of cell growth and cell motility which, in experiments, are easy to  change, although there are lots of parameters in our model. So we list the  results of varying several parameters in the cell growth part and cell motility  part.
1. Cell Growth
In the cell growth term, we  considered the growth rate was related to nutrient concentration. When the  nutrient was consumed by the cell, the grow rate of the cell would decrease  ( Fig. 7 ). There was a maximum growth rate γ0,  when the nutrient was rich. The parameter κ described the sharp of this curve( Fig. 7 ). The larger κ gave us more smooth increasing curve. And we made an assumption  that one unit of nutrient would change to cell number with a ratio α. Also in  the initial condition, the nutrient concentration ni can influence  the patterns. Therefore, the effects of all the four parameters were studied in  our model.
Above reuslts indicated that, the  faster cell growth (larger γ0 and  smaller doubling time) formed a smaller and a little more unclear ring pattern.  And the inner ring diameter would become a litter more large when the growth  rate increased.
From  above figures, it was found that the initial nutrient concentration ni had  little influence to the pattern, especially when it was large. The only effect  we observed was that smaller initial nutrient concentration ni  made the ring slightly wider and more clear.
Here,  the value of κ was related to the  initial nutrient concentration ni. When initial nutrient  concentration ni was fixed, a smaller κ parameter gave us the similar results with that of faster cell  growth.
When  we increased the value of k, the  patterns did not change a lot, but only became a little more clearly.
In conclusion, the simulation  results showed that the parameters of maximum growth rate γ0 and κ had a more important role on the ring-like pattern. And the other two parameters k and ni did not influence the  pattern much.
