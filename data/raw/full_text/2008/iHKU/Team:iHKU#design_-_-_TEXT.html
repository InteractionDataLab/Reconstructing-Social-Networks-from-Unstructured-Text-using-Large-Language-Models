Our Aim
We endeavor our strains to grow into  patterns by arranging themselves in a synchronous, self-organised manner, “just  as in organisms in nature which all are able to develop shapes and patterns.”  Implementing such idea on bacteria sheds light to a mechanism involving  cell-cell communication that would produce a key response, predominately a  respond affecting cell motility. The characteristics of the response logically  should be critical towards the formation overall pattern.

Chassis  selection
Past chemotaxis  studies have provided the molecular basis of cellular motility regulation, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis  are notably the well-understood strains which are ideal to be the chassis of our  designed genetic circuit. We chose E.coli as our chassis for the project reasoning that cell-cell communications will  require the use of a signaling molecule, which are often density related. E.coli is known to be less motile than Bacillus in terms of speed, thus would  ease the accumulation of the signaling molecule. We hope the subsequent pattern  generated by using E.coli as chassis  would be finer and more interesting.

Genetic  Circuit Design
An On-Off motility design is desired as the  response to cell-cell communication. Based on the pioneer work [3] shows the motility can be abolished by knocking out the cheZ gene, and can be restored by subsequent  re-introduction of the cheZ gene  under a controllable promoter back into the host.
We designed two  DNA constructs whose cheZ expression level would be sensitive to the  concentration of AHL (Acetyl homoserine lactone). One would become motile in the presence of AHL, while  the other one be become immotile under  the same condition. Since concentration of AHL is proportional to cell density, the motility of our strains  would be dependent on local cell density.
 
Predicted Pattern:
According to the results of our model, we got the patterns with ring-like low cell density regions, if initially we dropped a small volume of cell onto the center of the plate. ( Detials to chick here )
