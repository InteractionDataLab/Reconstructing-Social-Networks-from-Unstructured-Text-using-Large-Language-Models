A. Java
A simple Java program is used to automate  the picture capturing process.
This Java program will simulate a mouse  left-click for every INTERVAL  ms, and will stop after DURATION  ms.
import java.awt.AWTException;
import java.awt.Robot;
import java.awt.event.InputEvent; public class MouseController implements  Runnable {
private  Robot robot;
private  volatile boolean stop = false;
// you can adjust these two  variables for your own needs.
private  static int INTERVAL =  1000;
private  static int DURATION =  15000; public  MouseController() {
try {
robot  = new Robot();
} catch (AWTException ex) {
ex.printStackTrace();
}
}
public  void run() {
while(!stop) {
robot.mousePress(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK);
robot.mouseRelease(InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK);
try {
Thread.sleep(INTERVAL);
} catch (InterruptedException ex) {
ex.printStackTrace();
}
}
}
public  synchronized void stop() {
stop = true;
}
public  static void main(String[] args) {
MouseController mc = new MouseController();
Thread mcThread = new Thread(mc);
System.out.println("Picture capturing  started");
mcThread.start();
try {
Thread.sleep(DURATION);
} catch (InterruptedException ex) {
ex.printStackTrace();
}
mc.stop();
System.out.println("Picture capturing  stopped");
}
}

B. ImageJ
ImageJ, a  powerful medical image analyze tool, is used to measure the plate brightness.  The Region of Interest (ROI) is set to the entire plate excluding the edge area  where the high level of signal intensity caused by reflection of light source  from the plate’s side wall will distort the signal.
The light  intensity 3D plot is achieved by using ImageJ’s interactive 3D surface plot  plug-in accompanied with the automatic mouse control program. Pattern at each  time point will be plotted and finally integrated into a real-time growth  pattern.
For example, at  a time-point, the following pattern:
Will be plotted  like this:
and finally integrate the plot of different  time point into a single pattern growth animation.
Furthermore, we are hoping to extend this  method of measurement to other application, like recording total band  brightness on gel photo to measure the chromosome expression level by using  ImageJ with its build-in Gel analyze function. (refer  to Roy’s design).
The steps to  calculate the band is as follow:
After taking the  gel photo, use image to open it.
Use rectangular  tool to select the band as small as possible to just cover the band
Use  Analyze-Gels-Select First Lane (Or Ctrl+1)
Invert the  selected ROI
Use mouse  pointer to move the square selection to the second lane, select  Analyze-Gels-Plot Lane (Or Ctrl+3)
Use Straight  Line Selection tool to separate each lane
Use Wand Tools to measure area of each line
Finally, record  the result and plot graph
