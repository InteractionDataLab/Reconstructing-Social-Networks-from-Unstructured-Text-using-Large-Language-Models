Novel Protocols
PROTOCOL-1 Pattern formation
Day1--Inoculation
Inoculate  single colony into a 5ml LB with antibiotics into a Sterilin 20cm3  tube. Incubate in 37oC rotor at medium or maximum rotational speed.
Day2--Soft  Agar Plate Preparation
Weigh  LB broth with accuracy to 3 decimal places. Prepare a  master 2% LB of desired volume in a Pyrex bottle.
Weigh  BactoAgar with accuracy to 3 decimal places. If BactoTMAgar is used,  add 0.3g per 100ml of LB. If Difco Agar is  used, add 0.45g per 100ml of LB.
Add  to a Pyrex bottle (autoclavable) the agar and the appropriate LB solution to  dissolve the agar.
Autoclave the LB agar, then place  the LB agar into a 55oC before it solidifies.
Leave the LB agar to cool to 55oC  for at least half an hour.
Add glucose, IPTG (v/v) 1:1000, antibiotics (v/v) 1:1000 (if  applicable) into LB agar. Mix  well.
Aspirate 10cm3 of LB agar for each Petri dish, shake the  plate to flatter the solution across the whole plate
Wait for at least one and a half hour before adding cells to the  plate.
preculture for pattern development on  Soft Agar Plate
Add 2ml LB with appropriate  antibiotics to a Falcon 10ml preculture tube.
Add 40ul of the inoculation sample (dilution rate  1:50) to the tube.
Place  tubes in 37oC shaking incubator until OD600 reaches 0.8 -  1.0.
Add 2ul of the cell culture to  the centre of a soft agar plate.
Gently place the plates in 37oC  and incubate overnight (12 – 19 hrs).
<Note>
Use fresh plate, do not use plates prepared the day before since  water evaporates out from the plate and will cause the cells to swarm on the  surface.
Glucose & Arabinose can be  stored in room temperature but best is to store it in 4oC.

PROTOCOL-2 Picture capture
Preparation:
Light source: lamp
Frame: card-board box (e.g.with size37cm*28cm*22cm)
Background curtain:  light-absorb cloth
Picture capture device: web  camera
Computer: desktop all laptop
Location: warm room (37 ℃)
Device setting: (Fig.1.)
The lamp should be fixed on  the wall with its light shooting directed to the wall. The reflected light will  then enter the dark box with the light-absorb cloth wrapped inside. Drill  hole(s) on the top of the box whose size is fit for the camera lens. A box of  our size can hold up to 4 web cameras to take picture simultaneously.
The light-absorb cloth is simply stapled to the inside wall of the  card-board box. It will largely reduce the light refraction inside the dark box  as well as give a high contrast background to the bacteria pattern which is  white in observation.
(If  the light intensity is still too high, a piece of normal A4 paper or paper  tissue can be used as a mask on the open side of the box.)
Picture  capturing:
Software used for monitoring  and capturing pictures may be differed from various web cameras made from  different companies. Since the web camera we purchased is a product of Vimicro, we basically used their  software Vimcam (which can be found here ) for the analysis.
Since we may want to take picture for  the same plate repetitively in a fixed time interval and a long time duration,  we used a automatic approach with the help of a simple Java program. (You can  find the Java code and a simple  description here) The Java  program is will simulate a robot who will click and release the left mouse  button for a given time interval and this program will stop after a certain  time duration.

PROTOCOL-3 Brightness cell concentration relationship Measurement
Day 1 –Streak the strand of cells to be tested on agarose plate to  form single colony
Day 2 – Start seed culture
Morning: inoculate a single  colony of cells (or from a patch amplified from a single colony) into X ml LB.  Incubate on shaker at 250 rpm at 37oC
Day 2 – Start pre-culture before leaving
2)  Afternoon or evening: centrifuge the LB seed culture at RT; drain the  medium as clean as possible; resuspend the cells with the culture medium using  conical flusk with as large volume as possible, I liter or 500 ml flusk is  recommeded (it’s better to centrifuge and resuspend for another time); measure  OD; inoculate the seed cells into 1/4 the flusk volume’s (exp, 250ml for 1  liter flusk) minimal medium (2% LB medium)
Day 3 – Start experimental culture after  arriving
Morning: Prepare 200 ml LB-Agar with 2% LB and 0.8% Agar and  autoclave, put on 50oC water bath to keep it in liquid form.
Centrifuge the pre-culture at RT; drain the medium as clean as  possible; resuspend the cells into 100 ml culture medium (2% LB medium), shake  it on votex to make sure cells are separated thoroughly and unified throughout  the medium, measure OD(if OD is much higher than 1, then dilute with power of 2  and measure).
Prepare several clean 20 ml tubes. Pull 10 ml bacteria LB-Agar  mixture with cell concentration gradient onto plates
Add different volume of  bacteria into 20 ml tubes. (exp: 1ml, 2ml, 3ml, 4ml, and 5ml)
Add 2% LB medium to the 20 ml  tube to fill the solution to 5 ml
Add 5 ml of LB-Agar and pull  plate sequentially.

PROTOCOL-4 Migration rate measurement
Day 1 –Streak the strand of cells to be tested on agarose  plate to form single colony
Day 2 – Start seed culture
Morning: inoculate a single  colony of cells (or from a patch amplified from a single colony) into X ml LB.  Incubate on shaker at 250 rpm at 37oC
Prepare 100 ml LB-Agar with 2%  LB and 0.4% Agar and autoclave, put on 50oC water bath to cool down,  and pull plate.
Day 2 – Start experimental culture
Afternoon or evening:  centrifuge the pre-culture ar RT; drain the medium as clean as possible;  resuspend the cells with the culture medium (it’s better to centrifuge and  resuspend for another time); measure OD; When it is below 1.000 inoculate the  pre-culture cells into 5 ml minimal medium
When OD reaches 1.000, use  pipette to drop 2 μl bacteria solution onto the centre of the prepared plate.
Rotate the plate upside down  and fix it below the camera, use automatic Photo taking to capture Cell  migration status over-night.
Day 3 – Collect  data
Afternoon: 24 hours after photo  taking, retrieve the image data and measure the brightness of whole plate along  time course to analyze the migration rate.

PROTOCOL-5 Harvest sample from agar plate
Culture of the E.coli on  the 35mm petradish
Measure the OD600 of the cells
Autocleave the LB–agar and let it cool down to 42’C in water bath
Mix the cells with the agar to a final concentration of OD600 0.01
Pipet 1ml mixture into each 35mm petradish
Let grow at 37’C
Harvest the agar from the petradish
Remove the agar from the plate completely with the spoon made of  soft plastic(refer to the photo attached)
Wash the plate with 0.5ml PBS?
The agar and the washing PBS is to be collected into the 1.5mL  epindoff tubes?
<Note>
Cool the agar to 42’C before mix it with cell otherwise the cell  will be killed.
Cool the plated agar to the room temperature before put into warm  room; otherwise the solidification of the agar will be prolonged.
While culturing, the plates should not be piled up vertically,  otherwise the temperature will be lower for the plates in the middle, which  will result in slow growth.
All agars should be transferred to the tubes for the accuracy of  later measurement.

PROTOCOL-8 Recombineering
The procedure  used was similar to that described by Watt et  al [ 1 ]. About 500                                                                      μl from overnight cultures [5     ml     L medium (containing antibiotic where applicable) inoculated  from single colonies, grown at 32°C for 18     h] was expanded into 50     ml of L medium in a 250     ml Erlenmeyer flask, and incubated at 32°C for 2     h (until OD600 of ca. 0.4–0.6). Flasks were transferred to a  shaking water bath at 42°C and incubated for 14–15     min, before cooling to 0°C as rapidly as possible in iced  water. After 15–20     min, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 0°C (4000     g, 9     min). Cell pellets were carefully washed three times with  sterilized ice-cold water (2     ×     50     ml, then 1     ×     1.5     ml) then re-suspended in 100–200     μl of ice-cold water. Competent cells (50     μl) were transformed with 50–200     ng of (gel purified) linear dsDNA targeting cassette using a  BioRad electroporator (1.8     kV, 25     mF, 200     W). The L medium (1     ml) was added to the transformed cell mixture, which was incubated  at 32°C, for 2–2?     h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, ca. 900     μl of supernatant media was discarded, and then the  resuspended cells were plated onto LB agar containing the appropriate  antibiotic to select for resistant colonies.

PROTOCOL-9 Most Probable Number  method (MPN)
Preparation:
A original undiluted cell culture sample (> 1ml)
Distilled water
Vortex**
OD600 reader
Fresh medium (liquid or solid)
Steps:
Measure and record the OD600 value of the original undiluted sample.
Shake the sample thoroughly and draw 100μl  into a new tube which contains 900μl water. Mark the new tube  with 1.
Repeat step 2 for several times according to the OD600 value which have  been recorded. Every time dilute the previous sample 10 times and mark the new  sample in an ascending order, i.e. 2, 3, 4… (Since it is commonly believed that  there are around 109 cells in 1ml sample with OD600 measured 1.00,  if this sample is used, loop for 9 or 10 times is needed)
Up to this step, a series of diluted samples should be obtained. Every  time draw 100μl from the sample and drop  it on a plate. For every sample, repeat this procedure for 5 separate plates.
Incubate the plates over night, at 37℃.
Record the outcome in the following format, in which 1 represents a  bacteria growth is observed while 0 means not.
Check up the MPN table for the final result.

PROTOCOL-10 Bradford assay
1. Bacteria culturing
A 50 mL culture of EColi. was grown in 2%  LB media overnight (16 hours) in 37’C shaker. A fresh 50 mL LB culture was  inoculated with 0.2 mL of these cells and grown for 5 hours to an OD600 between  0.100 and 3.000. The cells were collected with centrifugation (Beckman,  13,000rpm, 2min, rt’C), washed twice with chilled 200 λ PBS Buffer, and  re-suspended in 1mL of chilled PBS Buffer.
2. Protein quantization
Sonication Settings:
1,000 μl aliquots of re-suspended bacteria  were transferred to 1.4 mL polyethylene tubes tubes were subjugated to  sonication times of (10”+5”)*10cycles seconds at 40% power (≈4.8 watts/pin). The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for  2 minutes to pellet debris. The supernatant containing solubilized proteins was  collected for analysis.
Or B-Per protein extraction  kit(recommended):
1000 μL aliquots of re-suspended bacteria  were centrifuged at 13k rpm for 10 min. to pellet cells. The cells were  resuspended in 200 μL of B-Per Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and vortexed for  1 minute corresponding to the Pierce protocol. 800 μl of PBS buffer was added  to the solution and the solution centrifuged 10min 13k rpm to pellet debris and  the supernatant collected for analysis
Protein Assay:
The amount of protein released after each  sonication time was qualitatively determined by use of Bradford Reagent. An  aliquot of 10 μl of each sample was mixed with 200 μl of 1:5Diluted Bradford  Reagent and the absorption at 595 nm recorded (CARY300 Bio UV-Visible  spectrometer) after 10~30 minutes of mixing time.

Plasmid digestion
Digestion temperature
Most endonuclease has the optimal activity temperature of 37℃.
enzymatic system
Includs plasmid/PCR product, enzyme, buffer and water, sometimes  with BSAin it. The system for enzymatic test should be no more than 20uL. The  system for recruiting vectors and fragments should be 50-100uL.
DNA  concentration in digestion system
The vector concentration should be no more than 1ug, PCR fragment  concentration should be no less than 1ug.
Star activity
Some endonuclease will have a less specific substrate selection  under certain conditions. It will cut different sequences from original  recognitions. This is called star activity.
In order to reduce the star activity, glycero concentration should  not be too high and DNA concentration should not be too low. In the storage of  enzyme there is glycerol. So the maximal amount of enzyme added in a system  should be 10%, especially for enzymes with star activities.
The influence of  Methylation
Some endonuclease activity will be affected by methylation of DNA.
There is a methylation form we can refer to.
Terminal  digestion of PCR product
The terminal digestion always has a low efficiency. Some additional  base pairs are always added at the end of PCR product during primer design in  order to improve the digestion efficiency.
There is a form about PCR terminal digestion.
Inactivation
After the digestion, endonuclease must be inactivated before applied  to ligation system. Different enzymes have different inactivation condition.
There is a form about inactivation conditions of all usual  endonuclease.
Digestion Timing
1 hour enables a test digestion. If digestion is used for cutting  vectors and PCR fragments, in order to digest thoroughly, about 16 hours is a  relatively good choice. However, some endonuclease used in the digestion system  inactivates quickly. So we need add new enzymes at intervals during digestion.
Refer to the form of different endonuclease about their remaining  activity after different periods of time.
