The P1 lytic origin must be activated by proteins encoded by a gene  carried by the plasmid itself. The gene, however, is controlled by a pLacI promoter  and is thus inducible by IPTG. When the plasmid is inserted into cells  producing lacI protein, the P1 lytic origin is non-functional and its only  active origin is the F’ origin that keeps plasmid copy number at a very low  level, possibly one or two (which is determined by the nature of F’ origin). When  induced by IPTG, the P1 lytic origin is activated and thus may keep copy number  at a very high level. 
                            To find out the relationship between the concentration  of inducing IPTG and the copy number of the plasmid, we performed a series of  experiments.</P><P>Method:
                            The common method for plasmid copy number  determination is using real-time PCR. However, real-time PCR is not available for  our experiment, so the method we used was plasmid extraction,  gel-electrophoresis followed by brightness analysis.
                            Procedure:</P><P>1. Pre-culture of pSB2K3 containing cells in 2% LB medium with Kanamycin concentration of 50mg/L. (not induced with IPTG)</P><P>2. When O.D. has reached 1, begin the experimental culture with a 1:100 dilution of the pre-culture into 2% LB medium containing Kanamycin and IPTG. 10 different IPTG concentrations were selected and they are 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 500, 1000 (unit: μmol/L).</P><P>3. Wait until the experimental culture has reached an O.D. close to 1. Measure the O.D. and calculate the volume of sample to be collected to make it contain the same cell mass as 5ml of O.D.=1.000 culture. Then collect the 10 samples and put them on ice.</P><P>4. Centrifuge down the cells and extract plasmid using a QIAGEN extraction kit. The extraction is done with extreme carefulness and strict protocol to ensure a high recovery and high repeatability.</P><P>5. The extracted plasmid is run with 1.0% agarose gel. 1kb plus DNA ladder is used as a control of DNA amount and plasmid size. The plasmid is digested with XbaI before gel electrophoresis.</P><P>6. Photo of the gel result is analyzed by brightness measuring software.</P><P>Rationale and  result interpretation:
                            The experiment is repeated twice (altogether three  times) to ensure the repeatability of this method. The values shown in the  result chart (figure 1) are the mean values of the three experiments with error  bar. Figure 2 is an enlarged part of figure 1 showing the first two data.
                            Figure 1</P><P>
                            Figure 2</P><P>Six data are shown in the chart, because for IPTG  concentration larger than 100 μmol/L the effect of inducement seems to have no  difference. Attached in the chart is one of the original gel photos, with C  being the control. This data is got from exponentially growing culture, in  which the mean copy number is generally smaller than the mean copy number of  cells from stationary phase, for the simple reason that in newly divided cells  there is not enough time for plasmids to replicate to the limit.
                            The copy number is calculated from the following  statistics: cell number at O.D.=1 from our experimental result; plasmid molar  weight calculated from mean nucleotide weight and the size of the plasmid;  volume of cell culture sample and final volume of plasmid solution eluted (50 μl); the DNA amount  in 1kb plus ladder (control) and the light intensity got from the gel photo by  brightness analysis software. The calculation is very complicated and is  omitted here.
                            To make sure that the brightness of DNA bands  corresponds with the amount of DNA in it, control experiments with 1kb plus  ladder of different amount to see if there amounts are proportional to their brightness  intensity. The result is shown in figure 3 and we can see that the result is  quite linear. The experiment is also repeated twice and the data is the mean  value with error bar.
                            Figure 3</P><P>The result shows that for IPTG concentration less than  20 μmol/L,  the effect of inducement is scarcely perceivable. It also shows that from 20 μmol/L to 100 μmol/L the copy  number is induced by IPTG in a way quite proportional to its concentration. It  seems that over 100 μmol/L IPTG concentration is “saturated” and a further  increase in IPTG concentration cannot raise the copy number (the data of which  is not shown in the chart).
                            Attention*: This result is from exponentially growing  culture. For cell culture in stationary phase the copy number possibly  increases (due to time limit, only one experiment is done with stationary phase  culture and the result seems to suggest that this raise in plasmid copy number  is more significant with lower IPTG concentration. Because there are no  repeats, the data is not included).</P><P>According to the experiment, we suggest that 100 μmol/L IPTG is  enough for pSB2K3 to reach its peak copy number, and if moderate copy number is  needed then 40-60 μmol/L is a good choice. This result is also valuable  when using pSB2K3 with other IPTG induced genetic devices.</P><P align="right"><A href="#p1">[Back to top]</A></P></TD><TD width="10%"> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
