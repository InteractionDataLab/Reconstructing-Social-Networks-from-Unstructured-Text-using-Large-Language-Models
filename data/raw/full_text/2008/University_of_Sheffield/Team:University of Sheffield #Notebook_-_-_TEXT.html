A Noob's Guide to starting an iGEM team
Our team is the fist University of Sheffield iGEM Team. Establishing it was a student initiative. If we knew better how to organize and setup a team, our last few months would be much easier. Therefore, we decided to describe the process of establishing a new iGEM Team. Hopefully this would describe the key points in starting a team and the things to do and not to do.
