Overall project
The aim is to engineer a biological machine that will sense microbial contamination of drinking water using quorum sensing. The organism would initially be designed to sense a wide range of pathogens – the coliform bacterias, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella enteritidis, Helicobacter sp., Vibrio cholera, Mycobacterium avium and the protozoans Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium sp., Cyclospora sp. and Toxoplasma sp. These cause a range of serious diseases such as dysentery, typhoid, cholera and many gastrointestinal infections.
