Our Story
Its been months of hard work...
Supporting each other and working together...
Friendships were strengthened...
It required concentration and learning lots and lots of new stuff...
Some of us changed our homes to the lab...
There were moments of despair and frustration (lots of them)...
And doubtlessly it was exhausting...
But no one can deny that we had a great time!
