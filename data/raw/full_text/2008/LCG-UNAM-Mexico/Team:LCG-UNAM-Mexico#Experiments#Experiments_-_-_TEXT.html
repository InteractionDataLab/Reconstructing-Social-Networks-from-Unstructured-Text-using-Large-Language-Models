Sensing dispositive
As planned, we started measuring at 0.5 OD in LB medium with gold  electrodes (gold was chosen because of its high conductivity). By this  initial approach satisfactory results were obtained the first day of  measurements. However, the second measurement day we detected there was  not a constant behaviour after each measurement replicate. The cause  seemed to be the LB usage. This medium contains yeast extract which may  be full of divalent ions. We expected to solve this problem by using a  buffer as TE pH 8 or  isotonic saline solution, but anyone of them would cause an stress to  the cell that could modify or measurements in an unpredicted way.
At the same time, we detected that one of the electrodes was stained(oxidation was performed), so we changed the electrodes  metal, avoiding at the same time heating of the electrodes or medium  and the noise that this could imply. Instead of gold we used chrome  electrodes recovered by platinum.
The second approach was performing measurements in LB with chrome  electrodes recovered by platinum. In this way obtained results were  more consistent after each measurement.
