We   used 18 tubes with 5ml of liquid   LBAm100 and  one control to grew  the 18 samples that we streaked yesterday from the pJET/rcnA clones.
At the afternoon  we extracted the pJET/rcnA plasmids from the  18 clones using the  Alkaline Lysis  protocol.
We load the plasmidic DNA from the  18 pJET/rcnA samples in a 1% agarose gel and ran them 1hr at 100volts.

NOTE: We are not considering the fact that cI:cI will be sequestered by the promotor. This doesn't seem important since we only have 10 molecules of the promoter per cell, compared with 150 cI:cI molecules (without the AHL signal).
WET LAB
From the 18 samples we ran on the  gel only 8 were useful because they were between 3.5 and 4Kbp. (pJET/rcnA  should have 3874bp)..
We used the samples : 2,4,6,9,10,  12,14,18 and double-digested them all night at 37°C using XbaI and HindIII  restriction enzymes; we also double-digested the pBBR1MCS-5  vector using the same restriction enzymes  mentioned before.

MODELING:
Estimating the amount of AiiA per cell:
AiiA  is under the control of the lac promoter. The transcription and mRNA  degradation rates help us estimate the amount of mRNA present on the  cell.
“The  half-life of protein A is assumed to be around 10 minutes which is  similar to what is used in Elowitz’s repressilator model [1].  Furthermore, we assume that a more aggressive degradation tail can  enable half-times on the order of two minutes for protein B.”
Modeling the Lux/AiiA Relaxation Oscillator by Christopher Batten
In the paper AiiA is called protein B. Therefore the degradation rate for AiiA with an aggressive degradation tail is 0.0058/s. This would give us a lower limit.
Transcription initiation rate, km
Malan et al. (1984) measured the transcription initiation rate at P1 and report the following value: km ≈ 0.18min-1
mRNA degradation rate, jM
Kennell and Riezman (1977), measured a lacZ mRNA half-life of 1.5 min: ξM = 0.46/min
lacZ mRNA translation initiation rate, кB
From  Kennell and Riezman (1977), translation starts every 3.2 s at the lacZ  mRNA. This leads to the following translation initiation rate: кB ≈ 18.8/min
Santillán  M. and Mackey M. C. (2004). Influence of Catabolite Repression and  Inducer Exclusion on the Bistable Behavior of the lac Operon. Biophys J  86:1282–1292
Simulating with simbiology, AiiA reaches stationary state at almost 3500 molecules per cell.
WET LAB
We inactivated the enzymes by  putting them  at 65°C for 20min, Then we loaded  them into an 1% agarose gel and ran them for about 1hr  at 100volts.
We prepared a 1% low melting point  agarose Gel in order to cut from it the rcnA bands that we obtained by  double-digesting the pJET/rcnA plasmid.
pJET/rcnA(sample 6) 0.2418g
pJET/rcnA(sample 12) 0.1872g
We purified the gel band using the QIAquick  Gel Extraction Kit.
After that we proceeded to ligate the pBBR1MCS-5  vector with the purified rcnA fragment using the Fermentas Rapid DNA  ligation kit.
We left the ligation reaction at the  20°C room  the complete weekend.

WET LAB
We use the  ligated samples of pBBR1MCS-5/rcnA to  transform E.coli TOP10 by electroporation.
We grew for 1hr the electroporated  cells in  1ml of LB at 37°C. We plated the growth  cells on a LB Gm20 agar plate .
2008-10-07
WET LAB
We streaked 4 LBGm20 agar plates  with different TOP10/pBBR1MCS-5-rcnA colonies, which were taken from the plates  that we made yesterday and let them grow all night.
2008-10-09
WET LAB
We took 3 samples from the  TOP10/pBBR1MCS-5-rcnA plates and put them into 3 tubes with 3ml of Liquid  LBGm20.
We used the  Roche  Pasmid DNA extraction Kit  in order  to obtain the pBBR1MCs-5 vector with rcnA.
2008-10-10
WET LAB
We ran a 1% agarose gel to verify  the extraction.
The vector with rcnA was  double-digested in order to verify the correct ligation of the fragments.
A 1% agarose gel was made to see the  digested vector.
The pBBR1MCs-5/rcnA was used to transform  W3110/YohM- competent cells by Heat shock. The transformed cells were plated on  LBGm20 agar plates and incubated at 37°C the whole night.
2008-10-11
WET LAB
The   W3110/YohM-/pBBR1MCs-5/rcnA colonies were streaked on LBGm20 agar plates  and incubated the whole night at 37°C.
The planning for the measurements was completed and ready to start.  
The propose for  the determination of nickel internalization considerates to assume that when  the medium has certain nickel concentration, the presence of cells from  different strains will cause a variation in the resistivity(which, by the way  will affect conductivity). For the different strains that we are using, we  expect:
Strain
Changes expected
W3110 / YohM-
As this strain    doesn’t carry the efflux pump RcnA. We expect  that the resistivity will    increase due to the nickel internalization.
W3110 / YohM- pBBIMRCS-5
We expect a    similar performance of these cells compared with W3110 / YohM-. However the    extrusion pump for gentamicine present in the plasmid could be adding    variation to the system.
W3110 / YohM- pBBIMRCS-5 RcnA
This cells carry    the pBBIMRCS-5 plasmid with the efflux pump RcnA. Here, we expect    oscillations due to the presence of a pump which internalizes nickel and the    efflux pump.
W3110 / YohM+
We expect a    similar behavior to the one observed in W3110 / YohM- pBBIMRCS-5 RcnA.
The two known  critical concentrations of NiSO4 are 2.2 mM, the minimum inhibitory, and 500uM the minimun  needed to repress RcnR activity.
Planned  methodology:
-Establishment of  a place to do the measurements.
  -We expect  to have a constant temperature during the measurement process.
-Test the sensitivity of the measurement  dispositive. To achieve this,  measurements will be done in agitation of:

Internalization
-Grow the strain  YohM- in LB medium until reach an OD(optical density) of 0.4 to ensure that the  cells are in exponential phase. (Later this was changed to an OD of 0.5 at a  lambda of 600nm).
-Plot  concentration vs  time and calculate the slope
slope= Internalization rate of Ni2+
Extrusion
The following steps were  performed in order to prove the RcnA activity, and to get the enough data to  calculate conductivity  from the resistivity measurements. These conductivity  data will be useful to get the extrusion rate of RcnA.
-          Grow the strains YohM-, YohM- + pBBMICS-5+RcnA, YohM- + pBBMICS-5 and YohM+  in LB medium until reach an OD(optical density) of  0.4 to ensure that the cells are in exponential phase. (Later this was changed  to an OD of 0.5 at a lambda of 600nm).

Some measurements were done in LB with and without nickel in order to  calibrate and prove the apparatus. Initially the measurement dispositive  included a gold electrode which seemed to be working properly.

WET LAB
Solutions nickel 500uM and without nickel at all were prepared from samples  of LB, and the strains YohM-, YohM- + pBBIMRCS-5 and YohM- + pBBIMRCS-5 + RcnA.

WET LAB
The OD that the cells must reach was changed to 0.5 at a lambda of  600nm(This was due to the finding of the proper OD measurement in the strain  W3110).
Some adjusts were done to the measurement dispositive in order to increase  its sensibility.
2008-10-15
WET LAB
Preparation of the strains YohM-, YohM- + pBBIMRCS-5, and YohM- +  pBBIMRCS-5 + RcnA for the measurements. An overnight of each strain was grown  in LB. Samples of YohM- + pBBIMRCS-5, and YohM- + pBBIMRCS-5 + RcnA were  prepared with different concentrations of NiSO4 . That  concentrations includes a gradient from 1x10-3 M – 1X10-10M. And the two critical  concentrations 500uM and 2.2mM.

WET LAB
Strains were prepared in pursuit to perform some new measurements. Samples  of LB, LB+ sulfate, and YohM-+RCNA+PBB were read.
Measurement intervals (100 milliseconds) semeed to be quite large, so its  correction was proposed.

The vector produced by a linear transformation is in two orthogonal spaces  (the column and left null spaces), called the domain, and the vector being mapped is also in two orthogonal  spaces (the row and null spaces), called the codomain or the range of  the transformation.
The vectors in the left null space (li) represent mass  conservation.
The flux vector can be decomposed into a  dynamic component and a steady-state component:     
v = vdyn + vss
The steady state component satisfies Svss=0  and vss is thus in the null space  of S.

Due to the great variation observed in the data, some aspects of the  samples, measurements and electrodes were reconsidered. As the variations could  be caused by the ions present in the medium it was proposed to use a buffer  instead of LB medium.
2008-10-20
MODELING:
The higher the number of independent reaction  vectors, the smaller the orthogonal left null space. The higher the number of independent  reactions, the fewer the conservation quantities exist.
 FUNDAMENTAL SUBSPACES OF S
The dimensions  of both the column and row space is r (rank;  number of linearly independent rows and columns that the matrix contains).         
dim(Col(S))  = dim(Row(S)) = r   
Since the dimension of the concentration vector is m, we have     
dim(Left  Null(S)) = m− r
Similarly, the flux vector is n-dimensional; thus, 
dim(Null(S))  = n – r
       Null space. The null space of S contains all the steady-state flux  distributions allowable in the network. The steady state is of much interest  since most homeostatic states are close to being steady states.
       Row space. The row space of S contains all the dynamic flux distributions of  a network and thus the thermodynamic driving forces that change the rate of  reaction activity.
       Left null space. The left null space of S contains all the  conservation relationships, or time invariants, that a network contains. The sum of conserved  metabolites or conserved metabolic pools do not change with time and are combinations  of concentration variables.
       Column space. The column space of S contains all the possible  time derivatives of the concentration vector and thus shows how the  thermodynamic driving forces move the concentration state of the network.
Singular Value Decomposition
SVD states that for a matrix S of  dimension m× n and of rank r, there are orthonormal matrices U (of dimension m  ×m) and V (of dimension n × n) and a matrix with diagonal elements ∑ = diag(σ1,  σ2, ... , σr ) with σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ ··· ≥  σr > 0 such that S = U∑VT
A non-negative real number σ is a singular value for M if and only if there exist unit-length vectors u in Km and v in Kn such that           
Mv=σu and M*u=σv
The vectors u and v are called left-singular and right-singular  vectors for σ, respectively.       
In any singular value decomposition       
M=UΣV*
the diagonal entries of Σ are necessarily equal to the singular values of M. The columns  of U and V are, respectively, left- and right-singular vectors  for the corresponding singular values.
Image from Systems Biology: Properties of Reconstructed Networks by Bernhard O. Palsson
Image from Systems Biology: Properties of Reconstructed Networks by Bernhard O. Palsson
 The columns of U are called the left singular vectors and the columns of V are the right singular  vectors. The columns of U and V give orthonormal bases for  all the four fundamental subspaces of S (see  Figure 8.3). The first r columns of U and V give orthonormal bases for  the column and row spaces, respectively. The lastm− r columns of U give an  orthonormal basis for the left null space, and the last n − r columns or V give an  orthonormal basis for the null space.

MODELING:
THE (RIGTH) NULL SPACE OF S
The right null space of S is defined by    
Svss = 0
Thus, all the steady-state  flux distributions, vss, are found in the null space. The null space has a dimension of n − r. Note that vss must be orthogonal to all  the rows of S simultaneously and thus represents  a linear combination of flux values on the reaction map that sum to zero.
Mathematics  versus biology
        The null space represents all the possible functional, or phenotypic, states  of a network.
        A particular point in the polytope represents one network function or one  particular phenotypic state.
        As we will see in Chapter 16, there are equivalent points in the cone  that lead to the same overall functional state of a network. Biologically, such  conditions are called silent phenotypes.
        The edges of the flux cone are the unique extreme pathways. Any flux  state in the cone can be decomposed into the extreme pathways. The unique set  of extreme pathways thus gives a mathematical description of the range of flux  levels that are allowed.
- The stoichiometric matrix has a  null space that corresponds to a linear combination of the reaction vectors  that add up to zero; so-called link-neutral combinations.
- The orthonormal basis given by  SVD does not yield a useful biochemical interpretation of the null space of the  stoichiometric matrix.
THE LEFT NULL SPACE OF S
As with the (right) null space, the  choice of basis for the left null space is important  in describing its contents in biochemically and biologically meaningful terms.
…may represent mass conservation…
 THE ROW AND COLUMN SPACE OF S
The column and row spaces of the  stoichiometric matrix contain the concentration time derivatives and the  thermodynamic driving forces, respectively.
