GROUP SESSION:
Students’ investigation and presentation of previous iGEM projects.
Several previous iGEM projects were investigated and presented by members of the team. The idea behind this was to familiarize with the kind of projects previously presented.
Brainstorming
This activity was performed by all the members of the group. We came up with several ideas, some quite unfeasible, but nevertheless it was fun.
Here are some of the ideas:
Bacteria capable of detecting diseases
Gas receptor
Sensing mood
Billboards with bacterias
Reacting to sounds
Swimming control
Motion sensors
Storing information and retreiving it afterwards
Solving mazes
Sensing alergens in foods
Sounds + Light
Invisible Ink
Degrading Tires
Making food starting with something unedible
Calculator
Degrading detergents
Writing from a distance
Removing oxide
Removing stains from clothing

GROUP SESSION:
Choosing a Project
Based on the previous brainstorming and some fresh ideas we chose seven potential projects. We stated positive and negative points on each of them, and each member voted for two projects. The three with the highest score were selected as preliminary projects.
The team divided in three groups, and each of these groups got in charge of researching one of the preliminary projects. The potential proyects were:
Bacteria capable of detecting something (alergens for example)
Reacting to noises
Degrading tires
Photosynthesis Biobrick*
Multistability
Gradual temporal sensor*
Modify an oscillator*
The ones marked with an asterisk, are the three preliminary projects.

GROUP SESSION:
Preliminary Projects Group Presentation
One or two members of each group described their projects and afterwards the whole team evaluated each of the projects. One was selected.
The team divided in four groups, each of them with a specific area: Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Biology and Physics/Chemistry. Each group would have to focus in their area during the project. Several tasks were assigned as homework including completely understanding a previous project and analyzing the pros and the cons of our team projects.
Photosynthesis:
Pros
Cons
Good project with a lot of potential
Almost no modeling has been done
 
Would be a long term project
 
Made up by too many parts
Oscilator:
Pros
Cons
Demands little lab time
It’s an extention of another project already done
A lot of potential for modeling
 
Easy to implement
 
Strong theory (easy to generalize)
 
Would be a nice first approach
 
Temporal Sensor:
Pros
Cons
Relevant
Many parts
 
Require much investigation
 
Time it would take to accomplish this project

GROUP SESSION:
Defining new project
We discussed the possibility of choosing three new preliminary projects to investigate and analyze next session since the project we had decided had already been done.
We talked with Dr. Miguel about the feasibility of our projects.
We pointed pros and cons on our six other potential projects. After a voting, three new preliminary projects were decided. The team divided in three groups and each of these groups was assigned to one of the preliminary projects.  The three newly selected projects are:
Reacting to sounds
Photosynthesis Biobrick
Multistability
