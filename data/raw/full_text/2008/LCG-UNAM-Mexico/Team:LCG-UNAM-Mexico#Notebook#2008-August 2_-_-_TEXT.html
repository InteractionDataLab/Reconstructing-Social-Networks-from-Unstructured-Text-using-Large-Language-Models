We received an e-mail from the Mexico-UNAM-IPN with several questions in regards to our project, here is our reply:
Hello,
We apologize for the late reply, but we had to discuss carefully our answer.
First of all, we think you are confused about what our project really is. We  want to make bacteria to modify the extracellular nickel concentration in  response to an external signal (AHL in this case), and of course, be able to  predict to what extent the concentration of the input signal will affect the  amount of nickel in the medium. To achieve this, it is true we have to  synchronize our cell population at the beginning. This is easy to do and  doesn't represent any technical problems.
We are very conscious of the facts you tell us, first: we know the half-life of  the lactones is relatively long (24 hrs as you say). That's why we are  including AiiA under a constitutive promoter in our model, which degrades AHL  very efficiently. This will ensure AHL does not saturate the medium. Second, we  know AiiA does not diffuse freely through the cell membrane. However, we don't  need that to happen, as each cell will degrade its own AHL (yes, we are  assuming that all AHL will enter a cell within a window of time).
In other words, we do not need to  synchronize the bacterial population more than in the first step. We are  considering that some cells may respond earlier than others. However, we are  assuming that, as we are not changing the physical nor chemical conditions, the  proportion of cells responding "earlier" will remain constant, thus  allowing us to draw some conclusions of the behaviour of the population as a  whole. We hope you see why the synchrony is no longer important for our  project.
To summarize what we plan to do, AHL will enter the cell and form a dimer with  LuxR (which is under a constitutive promoter, so AHL is the only limiting  step). This will start the transcription of cI*, which will repress the  expression of RcnA. RcnA is the nickel efflux pump, and thus we are aiming to  predict the amount of AHL necessary to get the desired extracellular nickel  concentration.
We are doing small moves. At first, we only want to make one successful assay.  We hope that in the near future we will be able to use the response time of the  system to generate a succession of desired nickel concentrations, thus  generating a song.
We hope this letter answers your questions,

MODELING:
Reaction 3, AHL:LuxR
Conflict: k3 (ON) <k3 (OFF)?
Reference: Goryachev et al. (2006)
The references they cite for obtaining their parameters were not specific for that kind of parameters, in fact, one mentions the rate of RNA polymerase in HUMAN!
- Check whether the article mentions how they transformed the parameters.
They seem to explain why in their model, the k3(ON) is "so small" to start with:
<<common to all models considered here, is that the stability of  the state "off" defined by the constitutive Transcription levels of I  and R comes at a price of high value for the critical self  Extracellular concentration.>>
This explains the criteria they used to determine their parameters:
<<For each layout we attempted to identify a set of parameters  that optimize the functional fitness of the network. The search in the  parameter space is constrained by requesting that the kinetic  parameters must remain in the biologically realistic range and the  resulting network should demonstrate the behavior compatible with our  present understanding of the phenomenon quorum sensing.>>

MODELING:
Reaction 4: Natural degradation of cI*
Half life of cI*:
The half-life of a modified cI is of 4 minutes, according to Elowitz & Leibler (2000). They analyze the LAA tail, and JB Andersen et al (1998) conclude that the LAA and LVA tails confer about the same time of life  to GFP.
Reaction rate:
Once we get the half-life time of the protein, how do we calculate the rate of reaction and the flow?
The half-life of a reaction (t1/2) is the time it takes for half of the reagents to become  products. In a first order reaction, t1/2 is a  constant and can be calculated from the rate constant, as follows:
t1/2 =-ln(0.5)/k=0.693/k
This reciprocal relationship between the half life time and the rate constant is very useful when making an estimate of the time a reaction will take to occur. Thus, for k = 0.01/s, the half life time would  be about 70 s. For k = 10/s, the half life would be of about 0.07 s or 70 milliseconds. The average life of the reactions of first order is also independent of the initial concentration. If the first half of the molecules react in aprox 20 s, half of the remaining  molecules will also take 20 s to react, and so on. The fact that the average lifetime in an unimolecular reaction is a constant means that, at any time of the reaction, a constant fraction of reactive molecules have enough  energy to overcome the kinetic barrier and become molecules of product. This makes sense because the energy of a set of molecules is distributed randomly according to a Boltzmann distribution.
* With information from RT Sauer (1999).
NOTE: A first order reaction is the type A → B.
Today we sent an e-mail to Dr. Peter Chivers, an expert in RcnR, to ask him for information in regards to RcnA.
Our mail to Dr. Peter Chivers:
Dr. Peter Chivers,
Hi! My name is Carlos and I'm a student of the Undergraduate Program in Genomic Sciences of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and currently I'm on the fourth year.
The main reason of this e-mail is to get in contact with you, I'll explain you why as briefly as I can. Several students of the program decided to participate in a systems biology competition known as iGEM, and our project focuses on regulating nickel efflux in e. coli. We have to both build the circuit and design a mathematical model to accurately predict the behaviour of our system.
Taking several issues in consideration we decided to regulate RcnA.
Here is the page of our team in case you're interested in reading more about our project:
https://2008.igem.org/Team:LCG-UNAM-Mexico
However we've been having some trouble in finding parameters for our model (such as RcnA's half-life, efficiency, synthesis rate among others). Therefore, having exhausted (or so we believe) the literary resources and having found your name in many of the papers regarding RcnA we decided to contact you. I'll try to explain with more detail the parameters we still lack in case you're interested in providing us with information.
I greatly thank you for taking the time to read this e-mail and await your answer.
Carlos Vargas
Dr. Peter Chivers' reply
Dear Carlos,
Thank you for your e-mail. From what I read on your website, it looks like your team is tackling an interesting project. Unfortunately, there are very few papers on RcnA itself, and none of them have examined the parameters that you need for your model. As far as I know, the groups that have published in the RcnR/RcnA area don't typically do those sorts of measurements so they are unlikely that have the data you need. We have no plans to do these experiments as my lab focuses on the nickel responsive regulators, RcnR and NikR.
I'm sorry that I can't be of more assistance. Good luck with your project, I hope it is well received at the iGEM competition.
Best regards,
Peter

MODELING:
Checking parameters:
Reaction 6
The value that had been found before for k6 (Pl) = 0.20mM / h is in reality the flow of the reaction (which is why the  units are mM/h). That is, how many mRNA molecules are being produced per  unit of time. The system in which they measured this parameter is a derivative of the plasmid pBR322, pTrc99A. It has the same origin of replication and the  number of copies is estimated at 15-20 but under certain conditions where replication is limited it appears to be between 3-5 copies.
Using the previous information we can calculate the value of k+ of the reaction in our system if we consider that each promoter acts independently and we multiply by the ratio between the number of copies of our plasmid and those of their plasmid.

To-do List   1. Find Missing Parameters.
- cI Dimerization.
- Nickel efflux . (Estimate?).
- RcnA degradation.
- Nickel Internalization (Experimentally,?).
- Initial concentrations (aiiA, LuxR? (Define arbitrary medium), ? (by  number of copies of the plasmid; change to molar), Ni-ext (experimental)).
2. Review tools in SimBiology (sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, moiety conservation).
3. Stationary states of the system (whether there is multistationarity).
4. Jacobian.
5. Analysis of the stechiometric matrix (also analyze the null space and its transpose).
6. Electrochemical theory (the relationship between electric potential and the concentration of nickel).
7. Electrodes.
->We need to check for advances in the construction of the measurement device we will use.
->Take into account the possibility of asking for support to Dr. Peña.
