Simulations were run for different values of the initial concentration  of AHL and Ni<SUB>total</SUB> (Ni<SUB>int</SUB> + Ni<SUB>ext</SUB>) which are the metabolites that we  can directly manipulate in our experiments. A parameter scan was also  run for some parameters to understand their influence on the system.</SPAN><SPAN class="bodyText">In order to gain insights into the system dynamics to  elucidate the conditions needed to get the desired behavior, we performed a series of analyses on it: Sensitivity analysis allowed us  to identify critical parameters that needed to be defined on the most  stringent way. Basis for the (right) null and left null space were  calculated to obtain information about the general network behavior.  Steady-states were calculated by graphic analysis of the systen behavior. Finally the Jacobian of the system was  calculated around the steady-states. All simulations and analyses were  implemented and performed on MATLAB.</SPAN></P><P align="justify"> </P><P align="justify"><SPAN class="style2">Simulation and parameter scan</SPAN></P><P align="justify" class="bodyText">Once the model was implemented on SimBiology, simulations were carried out to analyze its behavior through time after a given AHL concentration. We would like to observe a moderate and ephemeral change in the intracellular nickel concentration; this would allow our bacteria to sing without killing them.</P><P align="justify" class="bodyText">After exhausting our literature search for parameters, we tuned the remaining ones in such a way that they ensure the desired behavior.
