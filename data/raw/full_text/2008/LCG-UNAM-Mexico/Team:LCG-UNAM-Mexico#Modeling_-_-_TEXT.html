Modeling the system
Metabolites & Enzymes | Reactions | Ordinary Differential Equations | Assumptions of the Model
The objective of our modeling is to accurately describe and predict  the behavior of the system and its response given an inducing signal.  Also, we aim to better know and understand the  system through the  identification of critical parameters and species, and thus be able to  obtain the desired dynamics.
Our system is composed of 13 species and 11 coupled biochemical reactions that completely describe it. This can be represented through a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The simulations were done using Simbiology, a package from Matlab.
FIG 1: Our system is conformed by two regulation mechanisms. The first mechanism is the one controlled by us through AHL . LuxR and AiiA compete to bind AHL when it enters the cell. AiiA efficiently degrades AHL, while LuxR and AHL form a dimer. This dimer serves as an activator of CI *, which represses RcnA . The second of these mechanisms is the natural regulation of RcnA in response to the intracellular nickel concentration. When there is no nickel inside the cell, RcnR represses RcnA. However, when nickel enters the cell, it forms a dimer with RcnR and changes its conformation so it no longer represses RcnA. RcnA is then free to start pumping Ni  out of the cell. We are keeping this because it is damaging to the  bacteria to have the pump always on, and otherwise it would need a  constant supply of AHL.

Reactions
You can click on the next image to see a table of our reactions with their kinetics.
* The equations are numbered like this because those we  had initially defined evolved into this final list throughout the  summer. We didn't want to change all references made to these equations  so we just adjusted the numbering.
Ordinary Differential Equations
We are taking into account the following set of ODEs, based on the biochemical reactions above. This set  accurately and completely describes our model. Please click on the image to see a higher resolution.
Assumptions of the model
Once there is nickel in the medium, RcnR no longer participates in the pump’s regulation. If there’s nickel in the medium, we can assume that RcnR is always  coupled with a Ni molecule, so it will not be capable of repressing  RcnA (The few RcnR molecules in the cell will cause noise, but this  will be indistinguishable from the pump’s normal behavior).1
Cell membrane permeability to AHL is not considered inside the model. The model assumes all AHL enters the cell, however the concentration  needed in the model to obtain the desired results is changed by us  accordingly. 2
All decrease in AHL concentration is due to AiiA. We consider the natural degradation of AHL to be unimportant given the  time taken to make the analysis (AHL half-life is long, from 3 to 24  hours). 3
The change in the transcription of cI* is dependent only on AHL concentration. There’s a basal production of cI*, however the change will always be  due to the AHL concentration given that production of LuxR is  constitutive.
It is a homogeneous system. This means that the coefficients of the equations are constant (so we don’t have compartmentalization).
The quantity of nickel used by the cell is negligible compared to the concentrations in and out of the cell. This means we don’t need to include an equation describing the change  in the Ni concentration due to cell consumption in the time used by the  experiment.1
The  production of RcnR, LuxR and AiiA is constitutive and their  concentrations have reached the steady state at the beginning of the  experiment.
NikABCDE will not play a role in our model. NikABCDE serves to import nickel to the cell, however it only works in  anaerobic conditions and our experiment will be made in aerobic  conditions. This therefore implies that the nickel import will only  take place by the unknown mechanism, which nonetheless is constant and  constitutive.1
