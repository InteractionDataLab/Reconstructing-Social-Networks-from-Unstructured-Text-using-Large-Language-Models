Wet Lab
The main goal of the experimental work is to test our system's performance. We expect to achieve this by assembling two devices which will carry the system components. Once we have them we will proceed to test the system's behavior.
The first step is to assemble both devices. One of them includes luxR, cI+LVA and aiiA; the other one carries the cI promoter, RcnR operator and the rcnA gene. We will use conventional techniques, to assemble all parts and transform the final receptor cell. The final plasmids will be pRK415 and pBBR1MCS-5 respectively.
As a second step, we will proceed to test our system's behavior. Once we get YohM- cells (YohM was the name that the RcnA ORF used to have) with the RcnA device (BBa_K119009), we will measure changes in the medium's resistivity in order to get the nickel's extrusion and internalization parameters.  Our second device (BBa_K119010/BBa_K119011), will let us control our system. We expect to manipulate the concentration of nickel in the medium, which will be shown through the measurements and the sound emision.
