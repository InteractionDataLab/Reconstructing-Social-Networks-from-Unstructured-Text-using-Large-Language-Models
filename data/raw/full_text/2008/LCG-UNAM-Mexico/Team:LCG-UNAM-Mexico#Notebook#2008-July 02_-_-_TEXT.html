MODELING:
We  checked the dynamics of our equations further developing the beforementioned document
Reminder:
According  to Michaelis-Menten: V0=[kcat*Et*S]/[km+S] where Vmax=kcat*Et (as long as the  enzyme is saturated).
TO-DO  LIST:
- Find missing parameters and start evaluating the model
- Add  the dimerization of cI* and of the complex AHL:LuxR to the model
- Add  the regulation by RcnR to define the initial intracellular nickel concentration
- Include the constitutive synthesis of cI* in the model.

TO-DO  LIST:
- Understand Hill Cooperativity
- Find  missing parameters
- Determine initial  Concentrations
- Include  Dimerization

Transformación
We transformed the biopart from Chiba(BBa_I729006) using two controls:
*Control 1: only DH5 alfa cells
*Control 2: without cells
PCR
Part 1 from Chiba's Biopart
Part 3 from  Chiba's Biopart (normal)
Part 3 from Chiba's Biopart (mutated promotor )

WET LAB:
The  cell colonies transformed with the biopart from Chiba(BBA_I729006), grew successfully.
Three colonies from each cage were plated(concentred and no concentred), in 5 mL of liquid LB.
We  run a with the PCR products.
Each track contains:
Molecular Marker
Product from part 1 in biopart BBa_I729006
Product from part 3 in biopart BBa_I729006
Product from part 3 in biopart BBa_I729006 Making a mutation
Product from RcnA
Product from RcnA in strain RnA-(control)
In the first and second tracks there's no product, we will repeat this reactions.
*Repeat PCR for Part1 and 2 in bioart BBa_I729006

Cultures
From each one of the samples cultured on 28th,we chose 5 colonies and we plated in a 1 mL LB tube and we incubate it for 6 hrs. Our neative control was just LB.

Transformation
We transformed the product of the ligation and plated it in  cages with X-gal. With he purpose of save X-gal we chose to add it not in the LB-agar, but joint to the plated culture. In order to do this, we dilute 20 mL of X-Gal in 1mL of N-N-dimethylformamide. And from this mix we plated 25μl in each cage.
For the transformation we used two controls( one without plasmid and one without cell). When plating we excluded the control without cell and plated the DH5 cells without transformation in a Tc Cage and another of Gm.
Plasmid Extraction
We extract plasmid from te plated colonies. All the tubes pass the night with 1mL of ethanol at 100%.
Biopart  cI
The missing biopart(cI), was cultured in 5mL of LB with 2.5 μl of ampicillin(50%). It  was also plated in 5mL of LB without antibiotic and was plated in agar with ampicillin at 100%

Plasmid extraction
We finished the extraction of the plasmid, started on 29th.
We extracted the plasmid holding the biopart cI.
Gel
We run a Gel with the 15 samples of the plasmid pHET containing RcnA, part 3(normal) or part 3 (mut) and the three extraction plasmid samples containing the biopart cI+LVA
