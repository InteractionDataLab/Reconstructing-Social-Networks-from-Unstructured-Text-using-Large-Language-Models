System
First of all, we needed a system that could cause a change in its medium  conductivity. An extrusion pump seemed to be the best scheme to achieve this. Once this was devised, we needed a mechanism to regulate the system. We  decided to use a negative regulator because it's the only way to  transcriptionally regulate the expression of a gene in a definitive way.
We had to be able to restart our system, so we could add a signal at  anytime. This could be accomplished with an induction signal that  disappears rapidly after its involvement. The need of a link between  the inductor signal and the repressor, lead  us to include a little regulation cascade. This cascade allows us to  add new steps which might increase our system’s complexity.
The components selected to fulfill the system requirements are enlisted in the next table, you can click on it to see a larger version:
* All the references for this table are included at the end of the design section.
Primer design
For the assembly of the devices, the oligos contain restriction sites that are compatible to each vector or subsequent part. The synthesized primers were designed to carry the following  operators and promoters in order to introduce them in the devices.
The upper primer of the RcnA contain the cI and RcnR promoters in the BBa_K119009 part.
For the BBa_K119010/BBa_119011 the upper primer of AiiA contain the LacZ promoter and the modified LacZ promoter.
Devices
 
Device BBa_K119009 : The extrusion   pump.
The propose of this device is to manipulate the transcription of rcnA  by an inhibitory signal while maintaining the natural regulation of  rcnA through RcnR. To achieve this the device contains a CI  dependent  promoter, RcnR binding site  and the RcnA extrusion pump inserted in the vector pBBR1MCS-5.
Devices BBa_K119010 / BBa_K119011 : The  regulatory device
In order to control the RcnA activity this device includes  the gene encoding LuxR  under the regulation TetR constitutive promoter followed by  cI, which will repress RcnA in the prescence of AHL:LuxR. The last component of the device is the gene encoding AiiA. In BBa_K119010 lacZ promoter is upstream of AiiA, while BBa_K119011 carries a mutated version of it. The plasmid carrying this device will be PRK415 .
Note: Our final bioparts were send to the registry in the standar plasmid pSB1A2.
Sensing dispositive
We intend to measure variations in resistivity in a bacteria  culture which has been exposed to nickel . This is achieved through an  electronic system.
First of all we need a dispositive capable of detecting small  resistivity variations. To achieve this, a resistive array in a  Wheatstone bridge configuration is implemented.
To process the signal an Analogical-Digital capture card with an  USB communication interface will be used. This will allow analogical  data acquisition and its transfer to a computer on a binary format.
Detection of conductivity variations in the bacterial culture is  achieved by introducing two platinum-covered chrome electrodes into the  medium. Since high medium resistivity is expected, we use four  resistances of 100 kΩ, one of them is variable.
Efflux and internalization parameters
In order to determine the nickel internalization and extrusion parameters a gradient of NiSO4 concentrations from 1x10-3 to 1X10-10 was tested. The growth inhibitory and the minimum RcnR inhibitory concentrations were included in the analysis as well.
Before to start with the measurements the electronic system’s  sensitivity should be tested. In order to achieve this and get a  reference signal which would let us eliminate noise, measurements where  done with just LB, LB with NiSO4 and LB with cells.
Internalization
In order to  determine the nickel internalization parameter liquid cultures of the   YohM- strain will be needed at an O.D. (Optical density) 0.5 at a  lambda of 600nm, where resistivity will be measured for different  concentrations of NiSO4. YohM- strain was selected because  as it lacks RcnA, so it will be internalizing nickel all the time. This  may facilitate to get the wished parameter as the changes in the  resistivity medium might be caused by the internalization pump alone.
Extrusion
The following steps were performed in order to  prove the RcnA activity, and to get the enough data to calculate  conductivity  from the resistivity measurements. These data will be  used to get the extrusion rate of RcnA by a relation between the  conductivity and divalent ions concentration.
