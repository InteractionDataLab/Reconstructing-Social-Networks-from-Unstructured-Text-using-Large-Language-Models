Ka=Keq=[AB]/[A][B]=1/Kd
θ=[AB]/([AB]+[A])=[B]/([B]+Kd)
MWC  Model (Cooperativity)
A + nB <--> ABn
Ka=Keq=[ABn]/[A][B]n=1/Kd
θ=[B]n/([B]n+Kd)
log(θ/(1- θ))=nlog(B)-log(kd)                         …Hill's equation
Suppression mediated by cI:
ρ  + nCI <--> ρ:CIn     (k+,  k-)
Keq=Ka=[ρ:CIn]/[ρ][CI]n
Si ρ0=[ρ]+[ρ:CIn]
… ρ0=[ρ]+Keq[ρ][CI]n
=> ρ= (ρ0/Keq)/((1/keq)+[CI]n)
Flow=  k+[ρ][CI]n = K+((ρ0/Keq)/((1/Keq)+[CI]n))[CI]n
Flow= k+([ρ0]/Keq) [CI]n / ((1/Keq)+[CI]n)
=> Vm=  k+([ρ0]/Keq) & Kp=1/Keq=Kd
Therefore:
Keq = exp(  -ΔG / R T )
k+ = (KB/h) T exp( -ΔG / R T ) = (KB/h) T Keq

Gel
We run a gel with the PCR products obtained the day 01-08-08
Purification
From the PCR of the 01-08-08 we took 120 μl to purify DNA in a low fusion point agarose gel  in line with the kit.
We run an agarose gel to verify the status of the purified PRC products.

MODELING:
Hill Cooperativity
5th Reaction, conflict
If we consider that:
  - Keq = exp (-ΔG / R T)
  - k + = (KB / h) T exp (-ΔG / R T) = (KB / h) T Keq
and given that the flow is (k + / Keq) [ρ0] [CI] n / ((1/Keq) + [CI]  n), the value of the maximum speed of the flow loses its meaning.
The speed limit is being determined by (k + / Keq) [ρ0], but k + / Keq  = (KB / h) * T, and we know that [ρ0] is arbitrary, i.e., Vmax is no longer  based on the reaction as such, which does not make sense.
For  example: Take the same reaction that we are considering, the maximum  speed of the flow of the reaction would be the same with the promoter  that has the operators of CI, that if you used one with a random sequence,  so, whether we repeated the experiment, with the same temperature and  the same concentration of DNA and an equal number of copies of the sequence, the  maximum speed reached by the flow would be the same for the real  promoter as for for any sequence, without taking any consideration with their affinity for their substrates... That does not makes sense!
The proposed explanation is that the equation used to determine k + does not fit our model. We  should explore other possibilities.

Restrictions
Second simple restriction
Before the second simple restriction we cleaned the product oof the first restriction with the purification Kit.
Due to the purification protocol we knew that the DNA was clean and diluted in 40 μl of buffer, and in order to obtain an efficient restriction we try to dilute the less the DNA-Buffer mix, obtaining the following volumes.
Part 1; EcoR1
Buffer  U....... 5 μl
BamH1........ 2.5 μl
Clean DNA  ... 40 μl
H2O............2.5 μl
Total........... 50 μl
Part 2_cI; Xba1
Buffer  2....  5 μl
BSA.......... 2.5 μl
BamH1......  2.5 μl
DNA  PCR... 40 μl 
Total......... 50  μl
Part 3 (Normal); Pst1
Buffer 3....  5 μl
Pst1......... 2.5  μl
DNA PCR...  40 μl
H2O......... 2.5  μl   
Total......... 50 μl
Part 3 Mutated; Pst1
Buffer 3....  5 μl
Xba1.........  2.5 μl
DNA PCR...  40 μl
H2O......... 2.5  μl   
Total......... 50 μl
Part 4 RcnA; HindIII

HindIII.....  2.5 μl
DNA PCR...  40 μl
H2O......... 2.5  μl   
Total......... 50 μl

Plasmids pRK415 and pBBR1MCS-5 were extracted with the Roche kit(see Techniques).

MODELING:
Hill Cooperativity:
5th Reaction, solving the problem:
The error in the previous approach was that we were considering ΔG to be the same for both equations (for Keq & k+).
We know that the equilibrium depends solely on the difference in the free energy of Gibbs between the substrate and the product (ΔG 'th). The one with less energy will be favored in the balance, while the rate of reaction depends on the activation energy needed for the conversion (ΔG ‡). A  reaction reaches equilibrium faster or slower depending on the rate of  reaction (depending on the magnitude of its ΔG ‡), but the balance itself does not change.
Thus:
Keq = exp (- ΔG 'º / R T)
k + = (KB / h) T exp (- ΔG ‡ / RT) ≠ (KB / h) T Keq

GROUP MEETING
Wet Lab Statusk
Objectives:
- Build the bioparts.
- Transform the bacteria with the construction that we have.
- Design the experiments to test our construction.
- Build the system.
- Collaborate with the modeling group.
To do:
- Extract DNA from the wild type strain to obtain RcnA.
- Get the bioparts catalog.
- Obtain a large amount of plasmid that we can use, and amplify the bioparts.
- Transformation of the bacteria with bioparts.
Currently:
- There are plasmids.
- There are parts already amplified and in a plasmid.
Problems:
- The DNA that we needed was not in the registry.
- The oligos were delayed 2 weeks and a half.
- Issues to extract the plasmid from the colonies.
- Make a PCR ligation with the three parts and amplify with the ends (it did not work).
- With the enzyme used the frequency of spontaneous mutation was increased to about an error every thousand base pairs.
- There is a problem with tetracycline. You get false positives.
What can be done:
- The biopart with RcnA can already be linked to the plasmid.
- For the other construction we will have to link two parts and digest them, then link them with the third part and digest once more, then insert into the final plasmid.
-  HindIII can be used with the large biopart to verify the sequence.
Electrodes:
- Will they be specific for Nickel?
