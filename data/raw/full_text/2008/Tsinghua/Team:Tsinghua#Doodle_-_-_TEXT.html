Numerous & Wonderful Ideas
There are some other interesting ideas we proposed in our "Brain Storm":
Save E.coli from Lambda Phage
By Yilong Zou
It really drove me mad when I see E.coli lysis all of a sudden.
Maybe we could do something genetically to modify the lysogenesis of lambda phage...
Frugal Bacteria without C-N Demand
By Xin Rong
Make E.coli GREEN might be a solution...
Biological Glue
By Shan Lin
We could construct an E.coli that could detect gas or anything toxic, and then secrect crosslink chemicals to solidify the culture medium.
The crucial question is, do people want to use such bacteria in their home?
Simulate Arthromere Building with E.coli
By Ziying Liu
The spatial oscillation of specific signal in E.coli clonies might do the same as we learnt from developmental biology.
...

Forget the pWW0 and use Pseudomonas putida instead. I succeed in PCR and are building the BioBrick parts...XDD
Qi Liu

Mar. 7th is the Girls' Day of Tsinghua University, and boys of Tsinghua iGEM08 brought us lovely cakes and presents.
Thank u boys ^^.
Hong Kong
By Ziying Liu
It was my first time to Hong Kong and it is really a wonderful place. There were thousands of splendid scenes for me to take photos ^^.
I made lots of friends in SB4.0 at HKUST. And I love shopping centers and delicious food in Hong Kong :P
