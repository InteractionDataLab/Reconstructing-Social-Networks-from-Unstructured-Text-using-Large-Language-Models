I really take the iGEM competition an exciting event and I am happy to participate in it and design all these devices and detailed experiments. The experiments have made me more familiar with the molecular methods. This competition has also given me the chance to know more about the frontiers of synthetic biology.

Hi, guys. It is quite a great opportunity for me to acquaint you in this iGEM. It not only offers me a chance to treat my skill in the experiment, but also I can make my creative and even crazy idea be feasible. Best wishes for the Jamboree. Best wishes for my friends. I am dying to make friends with you guys, genius.

In the past when I am working in the lab, I always dream of doing something with totally free mind and without limitation of ordinary thinking. Now this dream really comes true. As the Jamboree is coming, I will bring my tears and joys to MIT and enjoy the free thinking. Go Tsinghua!

A person puzzled by a paradox: Human beings’ designs seem to be so clumsy comparing to delicate creations of nature. Ironically, one of the most ingenious inventions of nature is human mind.
