Goals for this week
Talk to Helen, Pete, etc. =)
Work on growing anaerobically, the electric current, and everything together?
Check that Shewie is growing by putting it with media, bubbling N2 gas.
Monday: June 30, 2008
Goals
autopsy/cleaning
LML current test
anaerobic burnicite test
research/buy O2 test kit
Questions to Peter/Helen/Orianna
Results from autopsy
membrane is pink but looks perfectly intact
regular epoxy on cathode looks different
dull grey color rather than silver black
feels like rubber, starting to rub off
fluffy white stuff in the cathode chamber where no bacteria was present
white/clear gluey stuff growing in cathode chamber
looked at under microscope -> looks like bacteria!
Lab
MFC Design changes
remade anode and cathode without using epoxy:
anode: titanium wire is wrapped around carbon felt
cathode: titanium wire weaves around Pt covered carbon cloth
Anaerobic burnicide test
see Tuesday for results
LML Current test
baseline current of 1 microampere
injected Shewie into anode side
did not observe any noticeable change in current
will try again with a higher density of Shewie
**Note: There was an initial hook-up error in cables**
Tuesday: July 1, 2008
Lab
Results from Anaerobic Burnicide test
Done at pH 7.3
LEFT: Anaerobic chamber with Shewie: went from brown to light yellow
RIGHT: Aerobic chamber with Shewie: turned slightly lighter but noticeably darker than anaerobic chamber with Shewie
BOTTLE: Anaerobic chamber without Shewie: stayed a clear brown
Conclusion: LML media should be fine for anaerobic growth in Shewie.
Experiment: Plated anaerobic Shewie and aerobic Shewie from chambers to grow colonies.
Resazurin test
4 vials
LML, open, 1 mL of 0.8 mM resazurin
LML, open, 1 mL of 0.8 mM resazurin, 1 mL Shewie
LML, closed, 1 mL of 0.8 mM resazurin, 1 mL Shewie
LB, closed, 1 mL of 0.8 mM resazurin, 1 mL Shewie
Results
Within a minute, vial with LB changed color
Half an hour to an hour later, the closed vial with LML and Shewie also changed color
Conclusions
Resazurin works as an indicator of O2
Worth trying LB and lactate (neutralized with NaOH) as the media since it appears to work much faster
Note: Resazurin will turn from clear to pink when exposed to oxygen again, but not to blue (first reduction step is irreversible)
Current Test
Parameters
Media: LB + 20 mM lactate at a pH of 6.96 (neutralized with NaOH), in both chambers
Shewie: 10 mL of Shewie spun down, resuspended in 1 mL of LML
Resistance: 400 ohms
No bubbling of oxygen on cathode side initially
Results
Observed current increase approximately 7 minutes after Shewie were inserted
Leveled off at approximately 34 microamps
Bubbled oxygen on cathode side at approximately 1700 s
Injected 1 mL of LB/lactate (same as media) at 2350 s
Wednesday: July 2, 2008
Current Test
Parameters
Media: LB + 20 mM lactate at a pH of 6.96 (neutralized with NaOH), in both chambers
1.5 mL of 0.8mM resazurin
Shewie: 10 mL of Shewie spun down, resuspended in 1 mL of LB/lactate
Resistance: 400 ohms
Differences from the previous day:
Used 2-inch needles: bubbling right on the membrane (better exchange of ions?)
Cathode partially in the air (5 mm above media)
Shewie was a day older (three days old) -> stationary phase possible
Shewie was from a different plate, but same strain
Different cathode/anode of the same material used with about the same resistance (25-30 ohms for the entire setup)
Results
Observed much greater current, but the increase was significantly slower
Leveled off for a while at approximately 110 microamps, but then continued to increase
Addition of O2 in the anode corresponded with a drop in current
Removal of O2 from the anode corresponded with a steep increase in current
Shewie/Resazurin Test
Ran test parallel to current test because it was taking much longer than the previous day
Added 1 mL of resazurin, 1 mL of Shewie used in current test, and filled vial with LB+lactate
Results: took nearly 29 minutes for the resazurin to turn purple (took less than 1 minute in previous day's test)
Time
Color
0s
Midnight blue
1735s
Starting to turn dark crimson purple
2300s

2885s
Nearly all magenta pink
2925s
Part clear
3755s
All clear
Thursday: July 3, 2008
Current Test with mtrA Shewie
Ran with the same parameters as July 3, but with mtrA Shewie
Results: Current production on the same order of magnitude as wt Shewie
Goals for the Future
LabVIEW vs. Excel?
Running multiple MFCs concurrently
How to set up Keithley for multiple inputs
Make more MFCs
Tic-Tac-Toe design
physical arrangement of parts
connections to Keithley
computer interface
selecting squares on computer -> output that Shewie will detect (checmical? light?)
