Built three more fuel cell chambers
Ran three wildtype MFC's
Conclusion:
Perhaps cells have died.
Produced negligible amounts of current.
There was some leaking in the 3rd MFC
There was some color change: possibly alive but inactive or "asleep"?
Tuesday: July 15, 2008
made 250 mL of OGM
prepare for experiment
finished building 3 MFC's
Wednesday: July 16, 2008
Set up LabVIEW
Experiment:
wt, 2 mtrB chambers
added lactate overnight
Note: Concluded indirect bubbling produces more consistent current production
Thursday: July 17, 2008
Finish building 3 MFC's
Growth curve for Shewie
Complete LabVIEW setup
Friday: July 18, 2008
Lactate injections on all chambers at t = 90000 s and t = 185000 s
