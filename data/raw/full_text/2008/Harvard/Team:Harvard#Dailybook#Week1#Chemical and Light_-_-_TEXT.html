Growing Shewie anaerobically
6/25:
Added lactate and birnesite to LB in a vial, bubbled N2 gas to degas it and then added Shewie at concentrations of 100 uL and 500 uL, while keeping a control with no Shewie added. Vials were placed in 30 degree shaking incubator overnight.
6/26:
All vials, including the control, turned light yellow (the color of the LB).  This was most likely due to contamination, which was partly confirmed by looking at the vials through the microscope.  This was not unexpected because the vials we used had not been autoclaved, and it was very difficult to maintain sterile conditions and precise concentrations of birnesite/ lactate.
Questions/ Concerns
Regarding transformations of BioBrick Parts:
Given the parts that we've succeeded in transforming in either E. coli, or Shewanella, or both, what is our plan for designing vectors?  How many plasmids will we need?
How should we incorporate Remy's plasmids into those designs?
To what extent can we take parts from or use the Duet vectors?
Can we confirm that pMB1 does work in Shewanella, contrary to the 1997 paper that suggests otherwise?
If we have successful transformations with both the 2007 and 2008 versions of a BioBrick part, should we prefer one over the other?
Regarding anaerobic Shewie growth: (Many of these questions may be the same as those posed by the Widgetry group.)
What are the optimal concentrations of lactate and birnesite that we should use?
Tips on maintaining sterility/ preventing contamination?
Orianna's paper lists three different media that she used for various purposes-- what does our basic media need?
How much Shewie should we be using?  Should we be adding them at a certain growth phase or OD?

Restreaking
06/23: P15, which has GFP under a constitutive Tet promoter did not appear to fluoresce (none of the fluorescent constructs did), so we restreaked all the of the plates (with the same antibiotic on which they were originally grown). They were left in the 37 degree incubator along with a blank Kan and a blank Amp plate (- controls).
06/24: All of the restreaked plates grew and were streaked to individual colonies. Both the Kan and Amp negative controls (no cells) were blank. However, p15 (GFP under pTet) did not appear to glow.
Overnight cultures
06/23: The above was repeated in 5mL LB liquid cultures instead of plates.
06/24: None of the cultures in LB Amp grew (E1P17 in LB Kan did grow). We recultured the other samples in LB Amp and made a master plate with patches from the same colonies that were cultured. Since others seemed to get similar problems (no growth in liquid culture but growth on plates for Amp), we made fresh LB Amp (from freshly made Amp stock) and repeated the cultures.
06/25: These LB-Amp cultures did not grow in the new medium either. We plated them on new LB amp plates (new plates 1X amp or 1/1000) and cultured them in low concentration LB amp (0.5X or 1/2000 amp).
06/26: None of the cultures grew on either of the liquid media (1X and .5X LB-Amp). Additionally, none of the master plate colonies restreaked onto the new LB-Amp plates that we poured grew. This suggests to us that the original LB-Amp plates were not selective enough (perhaps Amp broke down). As a control that our bacteria were capable of growth, we inoculated a plain LB liquid culture with each of the 6 colonies from the master plate. This culture did grow (cloudy). A plain LB liquid culture left as a negative control did not.
Miniprep of P17
ENDED IN FAILURE: SEE NEW TRANSFORMATION BELOW
06/24: Miniprep of E1P17. The DNA is in the -20 °C iGEM freezer. The DNA concentration is 54.8 ng/μL.
Restriction Digest
06/24: Digest of P17 DNA with Xba1 and Spe1. The entire plasmid is 4425 bp and the short fragment (containing only the BioBrick) is 902 bp.
Digest mixture (incubated overnight at 37 °C):
15 μl DNA
6.25 μl water
2.5 μl NEB Buffer 2
0.25 μl 100X BSA
1 μl Xba1

Digest. Note that these are not what would be expected for the correct plasmid (902 band for part and 4.5kb for vector). Even if there are cutting issues, the sum of the band sizes is around 2kb too low.

06/25: Since the previous digest was unsuccessful, we digested the same plasmid with different combinations of restriction enzymes. We also tested two other plasmids from the chemical group (P4 and P21). The digest mixtures were the same as above (6/24) with the appropriate enzyme swapped in. For the single digests, the volume of water was 6.75 μl and all else remained constant. Again, incubation is overnight at 37 °C.

From the lanes with P17, which again indicate that the plasmid we have from the miniprep is not the right size, we conclude that the P17 transformation failed. It is being repeated (see below).
Transformations of P22-24
ENDED IN FAILURE: SEE NEW TRANSFORMATION BELOW
06/24: Transformations occurred in duplicate (TOP10 and DH5α) with Amp selection.
06/25: All plates had colonies. We inoculated liquid cultures of cells with each of these plasmids in low (0.5X or 1/2000 amp) and high (1X or 1/1000 amp) concentration LB amp.
E1P22: 376 colonies E1P23: 352 colonies E1P24: 392 colonies E2P22, E2P23, and E2P24 had too many colonies to count.
06/26: None of the liquid cultures (both high and low Amp) had any growth. Additionally, we patched the colonies we were growing on a master plate that was of the new LB-Amp plates that we poured. No colonies grew on this plate either. This again seems to indicate that the initial transformation plates did not have enough selection (perhaps Amp was degraded).
Transformations of P17, 20, 25, 26
SEE NEW TRANSFORMATION BELOW
06/25: Transformed P17, P20, P25, and P26 in DH5α cells. P17 and P20 have Amp and Kan resistance, but since AmpR cells don't seem to grow in the liquid media, we're repeating the process by plating the cells on Kan (and eventually grow them on LB-Kan liquid medium). P25 and P26 are new and have Amp resistance.
06/26: P20 (kan plate) had 4 colonies and P25 (amp plate) had 1 colony. The other plates (with P17, P20, and P26) did not have any colonies. The kan and amp negative control plates (DH5α cells with no DNA) also had no colonies.
New transformations: P11, P15-20, P22-26
06/26
We transformed TOP10 cells using parts from both the 2008 and 2007 registries, apart from P11 and P19 which were not available in the 2007 registry.
The protocol for getting DNA from the 2007 registry is as follows:
1. Puncture a hole in the foil with a pipet.
2. Add 15 μl H2O and wait for about 5 minutes.
3. Add 1 μl DNA to 50 μl bacteria.
P17 and P20 were plated on Kan plates. All other samples were on Amp plates that we made (at 1X or 1/1000 amp).
Transformation results
Both negative plate controls (Amp and Kan) did not have any colonies. The "mock transformations" (no DNA) were also negative. The positive plate control had a sample of pEZ12 GFP from Remy and this plasmid also carried Amp resistance. There was a lawn of bacteria on this plate. We also did a positive transformation control that had 1 μg pUC19 DNA for 50 μl TOP10 cells. This DNA came with the TOP10 cells from Invitrogen and there were 26 colonies on the plate.

6/10 of the 2007 parts appear to have transformed (colonies grew) and 1/12 of the 2008 parts appear to have transformed successfully.
Remy's positive control with GFP was fluorescent, along with P15 (GFP with Tet promoter) and P20 (LVA-tagged GFP with Lac promoter). This indicates that the transformations of P15 and P20 were successful.
Set up liquid cultures (with master plates) for all of the plasmids that had colonies.
Minipreps and digests
6/28: The overnight cultures grew successfully and were mini-prepped. Note that there are replicates (e.g. 15A and 15B are different tubes from the overnight cultures. * and *-less denotes replicates during minipreppring). Unfortunately, I forgot to keep culture for glycerol stocks. I performed a NotI digest (see recipe under "RE Digest")- it's the standard single digest recipe, but halfed. The digest ran for the evening, and the results are below:

These digests were meant to test the enzymes and digest conditions. P3 and P1 were supposed to be controls. However they were Biobricks miniprepped from Shewie and it doesn't look like the transformation into Shewie worked as even the uncut DNA is not the right size. We will redo the digest with DNA from E. coli.
I set up another overnight digest but doubled the overall volume so that there was 1 μl of the restriction enzyme (NotI).

The bands in the cut P1-3 appear to be of the expected size. However, running a sample of the uncut miniprep gives more than one band (is this b/c an unclean miniprep?) P17 continues to digest as if it is a biobrick. However, the bands continue to be of unexpected sizes.
