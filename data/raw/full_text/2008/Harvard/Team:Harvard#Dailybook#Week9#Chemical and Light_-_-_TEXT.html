105, mtrB Ligations/transformations 08/17
Parts to ligated came from 8/17
We used a 2:1 molar ratio of insert to vector for all of the ligations. The ligations were all transformed into TOP10 cells.

In retrospect, it appears that all the ligations with mtrB are wrong, since the digest was actually wrong.
105 Colony PCR 08/18
The annealing temperature was 55 °C and the elongation time was 2'45" (we used Platinum Taq supermix).
Expected band size is 2475bp.

We used the Fermentas enzymes and digested for 25'.

QPI+45 Ligations/transformations 08/18
We used the 45 just digested, so all DNA was cut with the Fermentas enzymes.

Colony PCR 08/19
The annealing temperature was 55°C and the elongation time was 2'30" for P108+45 and 2' for P116 and P117. We used the Platinum Taq SUPERmix.

Ligations/transformations of P101+115/118 08/19
We used a 2:1 insert to vector ratio for all ligations. We tried using Amy™'s method of dephosphorylating (i.e. using the Roche kit).

Colony PCR 08/20
We used an annealing temperature of 55 °C and elongation temperature 1'45" and 2'15", and Platinum Taq SUPERmix
Lanes 1-2: P101 (115) vector control
Lanes 3-48: P101+115
Lanes 49-50: P101 (118) vector control
Lanes 51-96: P101+118
Samples 2, 4, 14, 25, 49, 61, 77 picked for 5mL culture and sequencing.
It's a bit alarming that the vector controls have ~1kb inserts. Uncut P101 should not transform, as the part contained is lethal (ccdB).
