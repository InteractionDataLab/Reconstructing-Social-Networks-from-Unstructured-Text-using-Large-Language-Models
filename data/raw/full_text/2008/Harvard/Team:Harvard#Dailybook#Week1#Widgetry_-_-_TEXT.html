Meeting with Peter Girguis
General Design
Three basic designs:
Vertical with two chambers stacked
Vertical with anode and air cathode below
Horizontal (perhaps with incline)
Nitrogen/Oxygen bubbling
Maybe do in flasks outside of actual fuel cell
Lab
Milled holes for injection ports and bolts
Assembled prototype for MFC minus anode and membrane
Make cathode using alternative wiring design to maximize surface area
Made another chamber using epoxy for autoclave test
Airtight test by submerging pressurized MFC prototype in water
No air bubbles observed

Lab
finished building MFC
added nafion membrane
added carbon felt anode
membrane did not pass water-tight test
silicon sheet started bulging
nafion membrane started warping
Warped membrane
Normal membrane
new MFC:
design:
anode chamber
outer “ring”
polycarbonate with 15/36” hole
smaller ring
membrane
smaller ring
polycarbonate with 15/36” hole
outer “ring”
cathode chamber
water tight test:
passed water tight test
membrane still warps
made 1L of LML medium (for anaerobic Shewie growth) ( see recipe here )
pH was 3.5 initially
added NaOH until pH at 6.99
autoclaved
Friday: June 27, 2008
Lab
Finished building air cathode MFC, minus injection ports
Autoclaved LML
Keithley test
Connected simple battery-resistor circuit to both 2700 alone and with 7700 switching module
Used 8.78 V source of 4M ohm resistance with 1% accuracy
Calculated current = 2.19 microamps
Measured current (from 2700) = 2.5 microamps
Measured current (from 7700) = 2.8 microamps
MFC test
1k ohms resistance
Bubbled nitrogen and oxygen into anode/cathode chambers.
60mL LML medium and 15mL distilled water in anode chamber
40mL of LML and 35mL distilled water in cathode chamber
Current began at around 21 microamperes, dropped fairly consistently before plateauing around 10 microamps after 50 minutes
Added small amounts of lactate, HEPE buffer, yeast extract, peptone in attempt to cancel out the current
saw sudden rise in current, but then decreased again.
no notable difference thereafter.
Switched to 10k resistance
dropped to about 4 microamps
very very very slow increase (about 4.1-4.3 microamps in 10 minutes)
Added shewie
initial increase to about 5.25 microamps
slow and steady increase to about 6.7 microamps
Switched back to 1k resistance
shot up to about 21 microamps
decreased to about 13.5 microamps after 10 minutes
Questions to answer
What temperature were the fuel cells kept at? Do they need to be incubated at 30ºC?
What type of shewie is ideal for anaerobic current production? How long should they have grown in liquid culture?
What concentration of shewie should be added per 50 mL of medium? OD?
How much current should be produced over 2 minute increments? Current production over time pattern.
How much resistance should we be using?
What should the voltage difference be? 6 volts?
What is the best medium? Can we get away with our LML medium, or will we need to make the....extensive recipe?
Why is there current production without shewie? Distilled water test?
