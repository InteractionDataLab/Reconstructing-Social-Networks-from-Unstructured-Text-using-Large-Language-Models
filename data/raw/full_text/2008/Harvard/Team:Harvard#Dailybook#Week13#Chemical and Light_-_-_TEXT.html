Colony PCR 09/30
Should grow only on carb
1-30: 20, 23, 25 (picked all three) --> P38+130
31-60: 31-60 (picked 31, 35, 39, 42, 46, 50, 55, 60) --> P39+130
Should grow only on kan
61-90: none --> P116+130
91-120: none --> P117+130
121-150: none --> P108+130

Picked colony 20 (P38+130) and 31, 39, 60 (P39+130) and grew them up in liquid cultures (LB Amp).
Amy's mutants
RE digests 10/01
Numbers refer to the master plate from 09/30 colony PCR. We digested with EcoRI, SpeI, and XmnI.
P38+130 #20
P39+130 #31
P39+130 #39
The expected band sizes are 2.2 kb (part), 1.6 kb and 0.4 kb (both vector backbone).
Ligations/transformations 10/03
We ligated the following plasmids. The ligations were transformed into XL1-Blue.
P108>131
P38+51>131
P122>131
P38+130>101
P130>133
P130>134
There were two colonies on the P130>134 plate. These were grown up in liquid culture to be sent for sequencing.  There were no colonies on the other plates.
Shewanella transformations 10/05
We ethanol precipitated the above ligations prior to electroporation of Shewanella.
We transformed the following plasmids into wildtype Shewanella:
P130>134
P38+51>131
P130>133
P122>131
P38+130>101
P108>131
P138 #1
P139 #1
P139 #2
P139 #3
P139 #4
P139 #5
P140
P142
We transformed the following plasmids into ΔmtrB Shewanella:
P130>134
P38+51>131
P130>133
P122>131
P38+130>101
P108>131
P138 #2
P139 #1
P140
P142
