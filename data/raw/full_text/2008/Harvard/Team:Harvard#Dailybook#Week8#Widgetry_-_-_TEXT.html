5.1.1 Results
6 Friday: August 15, 2008
6.1 RU1012 Light Repressible system experiment
6.2 Co-culture Experiment Follow-up
Goals for this week
Run co-culture test with DH5α, DH5α/pUC19, and Shewie
Move chambers to the "dark" to prevent a reaction from happening with light and oxygen
Test light-repressible system on plates
Monday: August 11, 2008
cleaned chambers
moved setup to a cabinet to have system in the "dark"
DH5α, DH5α/pUC19, and Shewie co-culture experiment setup
Chamber 1: DH5α + wt Shewie + Lactose
Chamber 2: DH5α + wt Shewie + Lactate            (pos. control)
Chamber 3: DH5α + wt Shewie                      (neg. control)
Chamber 4: DH5α/pUC19 + wt Shewie + Lactose
Chamber 5: DH5α/pUC19 + wt Shewie + Lactate      (pos. control)
Chamber 6: DH5α/pUC19 + wt Shewie                (neg. control)
Chamber 7: wt Shewie + Lactose                   (neg. control)
Chamber 8: DH5α + Lactose                        (neg. control)
Chamber 9: DH5α/pUC19 + Lactose                  (neg. control)
Tuesday: August 12, 2008
DH5(alpha) & DH5(alpha)/puC19 + wt Shewie Co-Culture Results
First Half
Notes:
At t = 5000 s, all cells added
At t = 90000 s, all injections done
At t = 155000 s, Lactose injections on Chambers 1 and 4
Second Half
Notes:
Computer restarted in middle of night, t=0 in second graph is 7 hours after end of first graph
At t = 925000 s,
Lactose injections on Chambers 2 and 5
Lactate injections on Chambers 3 and 6
Concerns
Repeatable current production in DH5(alpha) alone
Possible contamination?
Distinguishing features to tell current production of DH5(alpha) and DH5(alpha)/pUC19 apart
After first lactose injection, the current production of the two have noticeable difference in slope
However, initially after second lactose injection, the graphs overlap
Wednesday: August 13, 2008
RU1012 Light Repressible system experiment
Streaked plates.
All Cm/Amp plates with Xgal
Dark
Plate 1: RU1012 w/ plasmids
Plate 2: RU1012
Plate 3: Negative control (No bugs)
Light
Plate 1: RU1012 w/ plasmids
Plate 2: RU1012
Plate 3: Negative control (No bugs)
Results
RU1012 with Plasmid
Notes:
Plate on left was grown under light
Plate on right was grown in the dark
Possible repression seen in bottom left corner of the plate, but seems leaky
RU1012
Notes:
Plate on left was grown under light
Plate on right was grown in the dark
Exhibited same behavior as RU1012 with plasmid
Negative Control
Nothing on plates for both light and dark
Conclusions
Hard to distinguish if it worked with streaked colonies
May work better with lawns
Co-Culture Experiment Follow-up
When disassembling the fuel cells, took the chamber media and spread them on Xgal plates
Way of determining if contamination occured
Controls are not expected to turn blue
Thursday: August 14, 2008
RU1012 Light Repressible system experiment
Spread plates to try to create lawn.
All Cm/Amp plates with Xgal
Dark
Plate 1: RU1012 w/ plasmids
Plate 2: RU1012
Plate 3: Negative control (No bugs)
Light
Plate 1: RU1012 w/ plasmids
Plate 2: RU1012
Plate 3: Negative control (No bugs)
Results
RU1012 with plasmid under light
Note:
Colonies had specks of blue, but not very noticeable
RU1012 with plasmid in the dark
Conclusion
Possibly light is too strong? Explaining no growth in middle of plate grow under light
Friday: August 15, 2008
RU1012 Light Repressible system experiment
Repeated previous day's experiment exactly
Placed light further away
Co-culture Experiment Follow-up
All plates turned blue
Control chambers very likely were contaminated
Will explore possibilities of autoclaving chambers
