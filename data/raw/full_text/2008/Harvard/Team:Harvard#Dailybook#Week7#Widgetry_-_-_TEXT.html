4.1.3 Results (entire)
Goals for this week
Shewanella and E. coli co-culture experiments
If Shewanella responds rapidly to lactate, and E. coli breaks down lactose into lactate, can we couple lactose breakdown by E. coli with current production by Shewanella?
Motivation:
An inducible system in E. coli could be used to control Shewanella current production
Monday: August 4, 2008
Co-culture experiment setup
Chambers 1 & 2: wt E. coli + wt Shewie + lactose
Chambers 4 &5 : Lac-operon knockout E. coli + wt Shewie + lactose
Positive Controls
Chamber 3: wt E. coli + wt Shewie + lactate
Chamber 6: Lac-operon knockout E. coli + wt Shewie + lactate
Negative Controls
Chamber 7: wt Shewie + lactose
Chamber 8: wt E. coli + lactose
Chamber 9: Lac-operon knockout E. coli + lactose
Tuesday: August 5, 2008
Co-culture experiment results, day 1
Notes:
At t = 2000 s, all cells added
At t = 80000 s, all injection done
Zoomed-in graph of results, part 1
Notes:
Zoomed-in on time since injections
Positive controls omitted
Preliminary Conclusions
Noticeable difference in behavior between wt E. coli + Shewie and Lac-operon knockout + Shewie co-cultures
Positive and negative controls show most likely no other variables involved
Could be used to create tic-tac-toe which uses the difference in behavior to determine moves
Wednesday: August 6, 2008 to Friday: August 8, 2008
Co-culture experiment results, day 1 & 2
wt E. coli vs. Lac-operon knockout E. coli
Notes:
At t = 260000 s, adjusted gas for Chamber 5
At t = 340000 s, lactose injection for Chamber 1
Initially, very noticeable difference between wt E. coli and Lac-operon knockout E. coli, but the current production of one of the E. coli chambers rises after a day, making the difference less distinguishable
Results w/ positive controls
Notes:
At t = 340000 s, lactose injections for Chambers 1, 3, and 6
Wanted to see if the positive controls would exhibit the same behavior when lactose injected instead of lactate
Results (entire)
Concerns
Chambers with co-cultures contained double the amount of cells of the controls
Current production in non-positive co-culture chambers
wt Shewie + lactose
lac-operon knockout E. coli + Shewie + lactose
lac-operon knockout E. coli + lactose
Conclusions
Although behavior of wt E. coli + Shewie and Lac-operon knockout E. coli + Shewie co-cultures are not as distinguishable after a day, our focus can only be on the first day
Will try the same experiment with DH5(alpha) and DH5(alpha)/pUC19 strains
Need to look for inducible lacZ systems
Light-repressible (RU1012 with plasmid) system?
