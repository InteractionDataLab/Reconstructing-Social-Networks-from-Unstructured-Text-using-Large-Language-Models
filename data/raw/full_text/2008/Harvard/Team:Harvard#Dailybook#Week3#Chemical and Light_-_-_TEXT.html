Transformations/Minipreps of Parts from Registries
07/07/08
07/07: We transformed P42, P11, P51, P52, P77, P78, P17, Q01121, BBa_J06911, BBa_J06912 from both the 2007 and 2008 registries (P11 was available only from the 2008 registry). We also made a positive transformation control using pUC19 DNA that came with the TOP10 cells. We made three negative plate controls using mock transformed bacteria on Amp, Kan, and Cm plates. We used E1.
FAILED TRANSFORMATIONS
2007 -- P51 (Kan), Q01121 (Kan), P17 (Kan), P52 (Kan), P78 (Kan), P77 (Kan)
2008 -- P52 (Kan), P51 (Kan), P78 (Kan), P77 (Kan), Q01121 (Kan), P17 (Kan), P11 (Cm)
The Cm and Kan mock transformations (negative controls) also failed to grow.
Alarmingly, the E1 mock transformation (no DNA, neg control) grew on the LB Carb plates. All of the Carb plates had some colonies, so we only picked from those with significantly higher numbers than the neg control. 3 colonies each from BBa_J06911 & BBa_J06912 2007 (temp sensitive LacI system) were picked and grown.
Successful Transformations
2007: P84, P85 (BBa_J06911, BBa_J06912) -- miniprepped/glycerol stocks made
The Amp negative control colonies did not grow in liquid LB Amp. The Amp positive control did grow in liquid LB Amp (pUC19).

Re-transformations 07/10/08
We retransformed P17, P26, P26, P42, P78, P88 from both the 2007 and 2008 registries. We made the following changes to the iGEM transformation protocol:
Heat shock for 30s
Incubate for 90min in 250 μL SOC medium
Prewarm plates
In addition to the biobrick samples we also ran Amp and Carb positive controls (pUC19) and Carb and Kan negative controls (mock transformations).
07/11/08 Results
The Carb negative control had about 25 colonies and the Kan negative control was blank. Both of the Amp and Carb positive controls had lawns of bacteria. P26 2007 had 13 colonies and P26 2008 had 1 colony (both Amp plates we poured ourselves). P38+45 and P39+45 both had many colonies, but these were not fluorescent as expected (these were both on Carb plates but there were many more colonies than on the Carb negative control).
We made liquid cultures of all the successful transformations in LB Amp.
P88 failed to grow. However, the P17 and P42 plates had 1/2 colonies after another 24h. These plates were saved.
Part PCRs
07/07
More CDF was PCRed (w/ BioBrick adapting primers): 45μL PCR supermix, 1μL S1P13 (435ng/μL), 1μL CDF-F primer (20μM), 1μL CDF-R primer (20μM), 2μL water. Conditions: 5min @ 94°C → 35x[45s @ 94°C → 45s @ 58.7°C → 1m45s @72°C] → 5min @ 72°C → ∞ @ 4°C, heated lid
07/08
P11 and P17 from 2008 (left from punch), and P26, P38, P39, P42, P51, P52, P77, P78, Q01121 from 2007 plate were PCRed: 45μL PCR supermix, 1μL DNA, 1μL BBpfx primer (20μM), 1μL BBsfx (20μM), 2μL water. Conditions: 5min @ 94°C → 35x[45s @ 94°C → 45s @ 59°C → 1m45s @72°C] → 5min @ 72°C → ∞ @ 4°C, heated lid We're PCRing these b/c transformation for amplification has not been going smoothly.
07/10
Of the products from the previous days, Q01121 (P89), P51, P52, P17, P77, and CDF appeared to have bands. Since we wanted a higher concentration of DNA, we redid all the PCRs, with the aim of cutting out the PCRs that worked. Additionally, we lowered the annealing temperature with the hope that the PCRs that didn't work would work.

MXH's gel extraction protocol:
Cut out the bands
Freeze at –20C for at least 20'
Spin 13000 RPM 10’
Use supernatant for ligation
Then do gel extraction on rest of gel (QIAGEN protocol) and combine with above
Here is a ligation protocol (used by TA and MXH):
2 μL 5X Dilution Buffer
2 μL vector
6 μL insert
10 μL 2X Rapid Ligation Buffer
1 μL ligase
vortex briefly
incubate at RT for 10'
use 5 μL to transform 50 μL cells
07/08/08
We attempted to digest the following plasmids (per the Master Plan sent out to the iGEM google group):
A (BBa_Q01121) with ES
P11 with ES
P17 with ES
P23 with EX
P24 with EX
P26 with XP

P39A with ES
P39B with XP
P42 with XP

Digested P58 and 59 with EX, P45 with XP, P53 and P54 with ES, and P38 and P39 with SP. We plan to ligate:
P53/54 with P58/59. This will give us RBS + LacI/TetR + terminator + pLac/pTet + RBS + GFP + terminator.
P38/39 with P45. This will give us Hi/low constitutive promoter + RBS + GFP + terminator. This is to test whether we actually have P38 and P39.
These digests did not show bands of the right size on a gel and some of the lanes were blank. We re-did these digests in two ways: (1) using the same conditions as above (1 μL RE) and (2) using the NEB minimum required amount of enzyme (this was << 1 μL so we touched a pipette tip into to enzyme tube and swirled it around in the reaction tube). We saw bands of the correct size for P38 and P39 using the old and new methods, and bands of the correct size for P45 and P54 using the old method (1 μL enzyme). All of the other lanes (using both the old and new methods) did not have bands of the correct size.

7/12: Digests of 7/11 PCR products, P45
Using the PCR products from 7/11 (gel purified and extracted w/ kit), the following digests were performed:
Reaction mixes: 10 μL DNA, 1 μL BSA, 1 μL enzyme mix, 2.5 μL buffer, 10.5 μL water (total volume: 25 μL) Reactions at 37°C for 2 hours. ES mix used EcoRI buffer, XP mix used buffer 3
P17 with ES P17 with XP P51 with XP P52 with XP P77 with ES P77 with XP P89 with ES P89 with XP CDF with XP
The above was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (removes DNA <40bp, so the end fragments from the PCR should be removed).
Using the E1 P45B 7/11 miniprep DNA, a P45 EX digest was also performed. Reaction mix: 4 μL DNA, 1 μL BSA, 1 μL enzyme mix, 2.5 μL buffer 2, 16.5 μL water (total volume: 25 μL). Reactions at 37°C for 2 hours. Although this had the PCR purification procedure done, it still needs to be gel purified.
Ligations
mtrA and p45
7/7/08 Ligated mtrA and p45 using standard protocol from ligation kit. In step 2 5uL of Vector DNA was added to make a 20uL dephosphorylation mix.  In step 6, 4uL of the dephosphorylated Vector DNA and 4uL insert DNA were added.
07/09/08: P59+63, P58+63, P18+45
We ligated P59 (vector) and P63 (insert); P58 (vector) and P63 (insert); P18 (vector) and P45 (insert).

We transformed the ligated plasmids (P59+63 and P58+63 on Kan, P18+45 on Amp). We also an Amp positive control of pUC19 and two mock transformations (negative controls).
Only the ligation of P18 to P45 (P74) was successful (the plate had colonies that were fluorescent). We made a glycerol stock and a LB amp culture.

We used the standard ligation protocol to ligate P38 and P39 with P45. This will test the P38 and P39 samples that we have. P38 and P39 are the hi and low constitutive promoters; P45 is RBS + GFP + terminator. So if the colonies fluoresce, then our minipreps of P38 and P39 do contain P38 and P39.
7/12/08
The following were ligated, with 5μL used to transform E1:
Mutant Strand Syntheis Reaction
7/8/08 Used Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutatgenesis Kit (protocol) to create a point mutation in the pstI site in mtrA. Used 5ug of primer.
Gradient PCR
7/8/08 Used gradient PCR to PCR mtrB. Cycled 30-40°C x 10 and then 52-62°C x 30.
07/10/08
pPL-PCB from UT Austin successfully transformed into Shewanella (p15a ori)
pCph1-envZ-pprotet did not transform into Shewie (ColE1 ori)
The ligated p45-mtrA plasmid did not successfully mutate and/or transform into the ultracompetetent cells.  This implies that we should focus our efforts on mtrB as it does not require a mutation.
