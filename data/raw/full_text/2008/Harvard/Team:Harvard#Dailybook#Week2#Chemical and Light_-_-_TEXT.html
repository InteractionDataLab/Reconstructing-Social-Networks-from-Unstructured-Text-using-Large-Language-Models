7.1 Transformation of Lac/Tet + GFP into S1(7/3)
Goals for Week 2
Transform LacI, TetR, cI + their promoters and GFP.  Refer [ here ].
Cut Lac promoter -> GFP (P20), and Tet promoter -> GFP (P15), with Xba and PstI and cut SB3K3 (P5) with Xba and PstI and ligate.
Transform cI promoter. (Refer [ here ].
Put constitutive promoters on TetR, LacI, cI.
Put terminators and RBS on TetR, LacI, and cI.
Add promoters.
Make primers that have BioBricks prefix and suffix to flank the origin on Duet Vectors so we can take it out.
PCR out mtrA and mtrB from Shewie. Also put in with repressors.
Test anaerobic growth further with birnesite.
Ongoing Experiments
Sequencing and PCRs
6/30: Primers to PCR out the CDF origin of replication (with BioBrick ends) were ordered.
7/1: PCR reaction set up: 45μL PCR supermix, 1μL S1P13 (435ng/μL), 1μL CDF-F primer (20μM), 1μL CDF-R primer (20μM), 2μL water.
Conditions: 5min @ 94°C → 35x[45s @ 94°C → 45s @ 58°C → 1m45s @72°C] → 5min @ 72°C → ∞ @ 4°C, heated lid
6/30: Most of the minipreps of BioBricks that have been done have been prepared to be sent for sequencing. For longer sequences, both the BBsfx and the BBpfx primers were used. For shorter sequences, only the BBsfx primer was used (this primer is longer and therefore gives more leeway for garbled bases at the beginning of a read.)
6/30: 5mL LB-Kan culture of P1 is growing (from glycerol stock)- the plasmid can be digested to yield pSB3K3

Ligation and Transformation (7/1)
We are ligated the repressor coding regions (P43 and P44) to the RBS (P40). We are also going to put P15 and 20 into a p15A vector (P1). After sequencing P18 (cI regulated lambda promoter) we will add it to P45 (RBS with GFP).
We transformed DH5α cells with each of these new plasmids (P40+43, P40+44, P1+15, P1+20).
Picking Colonies (7/2)
All four transformations were successful, with many colonies on each plate.  Two colonies were picked from each plate.
