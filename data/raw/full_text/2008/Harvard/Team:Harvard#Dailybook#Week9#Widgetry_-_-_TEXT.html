Baseline Experiment for Chemical/Heat Inducible Systems
Baseline Chemical and Heat Test
What we did:
-Tested wt and mtrB strains of Shewie with adding IPTG, Tet, and heating to 40C
Results:
-Current production was very low for all chambers
-Less than 3 microAmps even for wt Shewie which is nearly a hundred-fold lower than what we normally found
-Chambers were not anaerobic
-Need to redo this test
