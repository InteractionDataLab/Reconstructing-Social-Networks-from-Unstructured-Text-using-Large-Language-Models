Repeat Chemical and Heat Baseline Test
What we did:
-Retested wt Shewie with IPTG added, Tet added, and heated to 40C to different chambers
Results:
-Heating the chambers to 40C led to no current production
-May have been a problem with the setup as Shewie seemed to have leaked out
-wt Shewie with IPTG and Tet added had normal current production
-Current observed was between the two wt controls
