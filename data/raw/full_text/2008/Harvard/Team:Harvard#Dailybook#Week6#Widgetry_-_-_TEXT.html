Goals for this week
Finish building remainder of chambers to bring us up to a total of 9 working fuel cells
Configure Kiethley/LabVIEW to support measurement from 9 fuel cells
Run test with 9 identical wt chambers to test for reproducibility of results
Use argon instead of nitrogen on anode side
First Nine-chamber Test
Clean and re-build fuel cells in preparation for experiment
Reused cathodes, but replaced Nafion membrane and anode
Placed built fuel cells under UV light to prevent contamination
Variance Test with Shaking
What we did:
-Tested how much variance existed among chambers by running 9 parallel chambers with wt Shewie
-Switched nitrogen gas with argon gas on the anode side
-Shook chamber 1 manually to see the effect of shaking on current production
Results:
-Current production range was between 50-75 microAmps
-Red line (wt w/ shaking) went up to 500 microAmps when shaking vigorously
-Shows that shaking directly affects current production
-Therefore, amount of gas bubbling directly affects current production
- Possible to use this as direct test for computer interface
