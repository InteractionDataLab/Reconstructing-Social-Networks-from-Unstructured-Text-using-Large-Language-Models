Transforming Shewanella oneidensis
Grow bacteria to log phase (OD 0.4-0.6)
Aliquot 1mL of culture to a 1.5mL tube. Make as many aliquots as you need for the number of plasmids you need to transform
Centrifuge aliquots at 12,000g for 1 minute
Remove media and wash with 0.33 volumes (330μL) of 1M sorbitol
Centrifuge at 12,000g for 1 minute
Remove wash and resuspend in 0.05 volumes (40μL) 1M sorbitol.
Place tubes in ice and use within 15 minutes.
Add 100-500ng of plasmid DNA to the tube
Electroporate at 0.55kV
Flush cuvette gently with 800ul SOC
Allow to recover for 1-2 hrs at 30 degrees C, shake at 200rpm
Spin down cells briefly, pour off most of supernatant, gently resuspend cells and plate
Colonies will appear overnight at 30 degrees C, although they will be significantly smaller than E. coli grown for a similar period of time. After 2 nights of growth, colonies become visibly pinkish orange.
Freezing these cells for later use is not recommended. Even with storage at -80C, subsequent transformations often fail.
Efficiency is variable; 200ng DNA general yields 20-100 colonies.
Ligation protocol, using Roche Rapid Ligation Kit
Brief Protocol
Mix:
5x DNA dilution buffer – 2uL
Vector (cut and CIP treated) – 0.25-1uL
Insert DNA – 0.5-6.5 uL
ddH2O – to final volume of 10uL
Vortex and quick centrifuge above mixture, then add:
10uL of 2X rapid ligation buffer
1 uL ligase
Vortex and quick centrifuge again. Hold at room temp ~20 minutes, then use 5uL of the ligation reaction to transform 50uL of chemically competent E. coli (eg, TOP10 or DH5-alpha).
Protocol Notes
Reagents
Make sure buffers are completely thawed before use. The 2x rapid ligation buffer contains a reducing agent that looks like white flakes when thawed. These white flakes must be completely dissolved back into the buffer before use.
Troubleshooting
What to try if your ligation isn’t working (in this order).
Make sure your gel box uses long wave UV. Short wave UV will cause thymine dimer formation that can destroy your sticky ends (e.g. the TTAA overhang of EcoRI)
Repeat the ligation. Try a range of insert to vector ratios from 2:1 to 10:1.
Review all of your digestion steps – are you sure you cut the vector and the insert with the correct enzymes? Did you let it digest for long enough?
Try a different tube of enzymes kit.
Still not working? Send the parts you are trying to clone for sequencing. You may not be cloning what you think you are cloning.
Bacterial Transformation Protocol
Chemically competent E. coli
To make chemically competent cells
Day 1:
Grow 5mL culture of bacteria in LB media overnight,  37° C , shaking
Day 2:
Inoculate fresh 100mL LB culture with 1mL bacteria from 5mL culture
Grow culture at 37°, shaking, to an OD600 of 0.2-0.4 (takes 1-3h.)
Perform the remainder of the protocol in the cold room OR take care to make sure cells remain cold!!!
Decant culture into two 50mL falcon tubes and chill on ice 15 minutes.
Spin for 15 minutes at 2500 RPM, 4°C
Remove supernatant and wash pellets in 50 mL ice  cold 100mM MgCl2 (add 25 mL per tube and combine tubes)
Spin for 15 minutes at 2500 RPM, 4°C
Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 50mL ice cold 100mM CaCl2
Incubate on ice 30 minutes
Spin for 15 minutes at 2500 RPM, 4°C
Remove supernatant and gently resuspend pellet in 10 mL ice cold 100mM CaCl2 + 15% glycerol (v/v).
Incubate on ice 30 minutes.
Aliquot 100uL to 0.6mL tubes and store at -80°C. (makes ~100 aliquots)
To transform chemically competent cells
Soak the spots in 5 µL of the warmed TE for 20 minutes. This allows the maximum concentration of DNA in solution. Start thawing the competent cells on wet crushed ice.
Chill labeled 2 ml conical bottom tubes on wet ice. Add 2 µL of DNA in TE and 50 µL of thawed TOP10 competent cells to the tubes. In our experience, these volumes have the best transformation efficiency. The 2 ml tubes allow better liquid movement during incubation. Extra eluted DNA may be held at least several weeks frozen or at refrigerator temperature.
Hold the DNA and competent cells on ice for 30 minutes. This improves transformation efficiency by a significant amount.
Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ºC for 60 seconds. A water bath is important to improve heat transfer to the cells.
Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 200 μl of SOC broth (check that this broth is not turbid, which would indicate previous contamination and bacterial growth). This broth should contain no antibiotics.
Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 2 hours while the tubes are rotating or shaking. We have found that growth for 2 hours helps in transformation efficiency, especially for plasmids with antibiotic resistance other than ampicillin.
Label an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 250 µl of the incubated cell culture on the plate.
Incubate the plate at 37ºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics, especially ampicillin, start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow.
Restriction Digest, using New England Biolabs (NEB) Enzymes
Pick a volume where it will be easy to calculate the quantities of 10x and 100x buffers to add and write out a quick recipe (See samples).
(You can add a little water or EB buffer to make this easy,  without hurting the reaction)
Pipette the DNA to cut into a 1.5ml eppendorf tube.
(Keep a few micoliters to run on a gel against the product, as a negative control)
Add water if you need (See example below)
Add 10X reaction buffer
(See the enzyme(s) page in the NEB manual or website for the correct one)
Add 100X BSA if needed
(BSA is recommended for some reactions (see manual), and will not hurt any)
Add restriction enzyme(s) last
(Keep these on ice or in a freezer box, Always) (Also, keep the percentage of enzyme in the reaction below 5% by volume to avoid nonspecific cutting)
Let the reaction run at the temperature recommended in the NEB manual for at least 2 hours.
(Overnight is ok)
Run a bit of the digest sample against the undigested control to confirm that the digstion worked.
Sample single digest (50 ul total volume)
30ul DNA
13.5ul Water

For Reaction:
Add standard (or sample) to LBB at 1:3 (0.25 mL standard:0.75 mL LBB)
Use DI water as blank before running standard curve
Incubate in dark for 15 minutes
Record Absorbance on a spec at 620 nm
Note:  The linear range for the LBB colorimetric method is 10-50 uM.  If your samples are above this limit, dilute accordingly to bring into linear range.  Do not force standard curve through zero – there is a background for the LBB solution.
Setting up Samples for Sequencing
Testing IPTG Inducible GFP Systems
Grow overnight culture of cells (including positive control w/o repressor and negative control w/o fluorescence)
In morning do a 1:20 dilution in LB w/ resitance markers
Incubate for ~2hrs
OD and measure fluorescence (for GFP ex 489 and em 509) - OD levels should be between .3 and .5
Add 1mM IPTG to half of each sample
Incubate for 2hrs
OD and measure fluorescence
Pouring LB plates w/ antibiotics
Heat LB-agar in microwave until it melts - take it out when it starts to boil (about 4 min). Be careful to make sure it doesn't boil over
Gently swirl media and let cool to below 45-50°C (able to hold w/o pain for 10 s). Try to avoid creating too many bubbles. Adding amp at a higher temperature will ruin it. To speed the cooling process, you can swirl it in ice water; however, if you let the temperature drop too low the agar will begin to harden and you will have to re-melt it.
All following steps must be done by a flame
Once cool enough add antibiotic in a 1:1000 dilution (Amp, Sm, Kan, Cm are all stored as 1000x stock)
Quickly pour into petri dishes- add enough to each plate so that the agar just covers the entire plate
Flame bubbles or move them to the side of plate by gently tilting plate
Leave plates on table until they solidify with lids on
Label sleeve or individual plates. Kan= kanamycin, Amp= ampicillin, Cm= chloramphenicol, Sm= spectomycin
Ethanol precipitation of Takara ligations
Place a 15mL falcon of 200 proof ethanol in ice (there's an aliquot in -20°C most likely)
Put a microcentrifuge into a 4°C fridge (you might have to take the rocker out of the one in the small room)
Add 1/10 volume's (of original ligation) worth of pH 5.2 3M sodium acetate; mix well
Add 2 volume's (of original ligation) worth of ice cold 200 proof ethanol; mix well
Stick in -80°C for 15-20 minutes
Spin at max speed (at least 13,000 rpm) for 15-20 minutes at 4°C
Remove supernatant- be careful not to remove the DNA, which may or may not be a visible pellet at the bottom of the tube. It's better to leave some ethanol than to lose your DNA.
Add 1mL 70% EtOH; mix by vortexing briefly
Spin at max speed in microfuge for 1min
Remove supernatant- be careful not to remove the DNA, which may or may not be a visible pellet at the bottom of the tube. It's better to leave some ethanol than to lose your DNA.
Use the vacuum centrifuge (on widget group's bench) to evaporate the remaining ethanol
Resuspend in 10-15μL sterile nuclease-free water. Be sure to pipet the water repeatedly onto the sides of the bottom of the tube and vortex gently a few times. Spin down everything.
