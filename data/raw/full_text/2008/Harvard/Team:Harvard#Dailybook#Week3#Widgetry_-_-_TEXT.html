6.1 Lab
Goals for this week
Make Orianna's growth media
construct more chambers to run parallel tests
set up Keithley for multiple tests
grow mtrA, mtrB,wt, E. coli in liquid cultures
negative control E. coli in LB/lactate
standardize tests (OD, bubbling, etc)
Monday: June 7, 2008
E. Coli Negative Control in LB
Tuesday: June 8, 2008
Constructed two new MFCs
grew mtrA, mtrB, wt, and E. coli in LB+lactate liquid cultures
Ran negative control with E. coli in NaPIPES media
Wednesday: June 9, 2008
Made Orianna's growth media
First followed recipe exactly: pH = 3.4
Added NaOH to neutralize media
Missing amino acids
Grew wt Shewie, mtrA, mtrB, and mtrC/omcA in Orianna's growth media
overnight cultures
RESULTS:
OD readings:
wt: -0.001
mtrA: 0.001
mtrB: 0.003
mtrC/omcA: 0.002
CONCLUSION:
Orianna's growth media isn't working. Go see Colleen for possible sources of error.
OD readings from liquid cultures grown in LB + lactate growth media
wt: 2.489
mtrB: 1.711
Ran MFC overnight with mtrB and wt Shewie strains.
added strains first without lactate
waited until chambers became anaerobic (color-change) to add lactate
wt cell chamber denser than mtrB cell chamber
N2 stopped in wt chamber. turned off N2 in mtrB chamber to mirror this change
Experiment continued
replenished lactate in wt chamber
fluctuations may have resulted from air/N2 flow
Thursday: June 10, 2008
Continued running experiment from Wednesday
Purchased pipe cleaners, resistors
Made OGM with potassium PIPES
Friday: June 11, 2008
Lab
set up three chamber system
tested wt, mtrA, negative control:
resistances:
wt:
mtrA:
none:
465 s: injected Shewie
3500 s: injected Lactate & stopped N2
Nitrogen stopped bubbling somewhere between 70,000 & 80,000
Conclusion
Day 1, current production of wt and mtrA Shewie match that in literature
When wt peaks at around 275 microamps, mtrA Shewie is producing 25-50 microamps
