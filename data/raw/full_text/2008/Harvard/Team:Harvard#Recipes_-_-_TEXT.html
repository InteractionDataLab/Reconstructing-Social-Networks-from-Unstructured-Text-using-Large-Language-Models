We experimented with several types of growth media for Shewanella growth, both aerobically and anaerobically. The most effective growth media recipes are listed as follows.
Contents
1 Recipes
1.1 Orianna's growth media
1.2 LML medium (for anaerobic Shewanella growth)
1.3 LML agar (for Shewanella reduction test)
1.4 Chamber media
1.5 Phosphate buffer
1.6 Lactate solution
Orianna's growth media
