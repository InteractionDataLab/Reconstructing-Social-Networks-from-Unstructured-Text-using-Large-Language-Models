Cut two wire 18" wire leads per fuel cell
Strip ends, place one wire in each screw terminal, screw tight
Tape paired wires (two are attached to each channel) near non-attached ends and label
Clamp wire bundles near back of device with provided plastic latch clamps
Close Multiplexer and slide into 2700 DMM
2) Create Resistor Array
Connect resistors across middle of breadboard (one per fuel cell)
Connect leads from multiplexer across resistors (one pair across each resistor)
Controlling the DMM with LabVIEW™
Initialize Multimeter
Attach 2700 to COM1 port of desktop computer w/ LabVIEW™
Download our LabVIEW™ source code MFCs.vi
Open Program in LabVIEW™, adjust block diagram as necessary
Experiment Preparation
Begin 1 day prior to experiment
Assembling Chambers
Procedure
1) Prepare Electrodes
Attach Luer Lock injection ports to all chamber screws
Poke tip of electrodes through designated ports from the inside
2) Align Chambers
Lay one chamber on a flat surface
Place silicone square ring on top edge of tube
Place polycarbonate square on silicone
Place silicone 'O' ring around central pore
Place Nafion membrane on top of 'O' ring
Sandwich membrane between second 'O' ring
Align second polycarbonate square on top of 'O' ring
Center second silicone square ring on polycarbonate square
Set second chamber on top of silicone, ensuring ports facing same direction as first chamber
3) Clamp Chambers
Move assembly into vice or clamp
Insert rods through holes in end plates and screw on wing nuts
Tighten evenly

Pick single colony from plate, add to flask
Incubate overnight in shaker at 30C
Runtime
Begin 2 hours prior to experiment
Bacteria
Procedure
Pipet the cells out of the flask and into 250mL centrifuge containers
Make sure the containers are close in weight (within 0.5g of each other)
For a culture more than 250mL split it into two containers
Set the centrifuge temperature to 22-23C, spin speed to 5000RPM, and time to 15 min
After first spin, drain each container of the LB, making sure to leave the bacteria pellet intact
Resuspend pellet in 50mL of potassium buffer
After bacteria are fully resuspended (no pellets at all), spin down again, 22-23C, 5000RPM, 15min.
Pour potassium buffer out of container slowly.
Resuspend pellet in 50mL of potassium buffer
Spin down again, 22-23C, 5000RPM, 15min.
Pour potassium buffer out of container slowly.
Resuspend pellet in 4 mL of sodium pipes
Check OD (100microliters in 15mL or 1:150 dilution)
If OD is in linear range, calculate dilution for desired quantity of bacteria in 1mL (typically 10^8 cells /mL of chamber media)
Repeat dilution if not in linear range (using different ratio)
Inject 1mL of bacteria into each chamber (see below)
Fuel Cells
Procedure
Pipet 75mL of NaPiPES solution into each side of fuel cells
Inject 1mL of Resazurin solution into each side of chamber
Using Luer Lock nozzles, connect tubing from top ports to beaker w/ distilled water
Cut tubing to span distance from manifolds to each fuel cell (1 from nitrogen, 1 from air)
Attach syringe needles to tubing via Luer Lock nozzles
Using Luer Lock nozzles, connect tubing from manifolds
Start gas flow
Poke needles through bottom ports on fuel cells
Measurements
Procedure
Turn on computer and digital multimeter
Open LabVIEW program
Click Run arrow to take resistance readings
Connect fuel cells to resistor array via alligator clips
Click "Begin Current Readings" Icon on instrument display
Injections/Variables
Procedure
Once current readings reach equilibrium, inject bacteria into fuels cells using syringes
Allow bacteria to consume any carbon sources left in their media (approximately 12 hours)
Once current levels reach stable baseline, inject 1ml lactate solution
Inject additional variables as desired
Clean Up
Procedure
Drain chambers and soak in 70% ethanol
Remove carbon felt from anodes and discard (save titanium)
Scrub all parts in ethanol and distilled water successively
