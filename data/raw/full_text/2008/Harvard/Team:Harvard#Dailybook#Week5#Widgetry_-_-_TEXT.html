Goals for the Week
Last week, had experiment with no current at all
Hypothesized that cells were dead?
Run test with 1 day vs. 2 day old Shewie to determine if there is an effect
Tuesday: July 22, 2008
started mtrB and wt cultures
mtrB culture to be used as 2-day culture on Thursday
troubleshoot LabVIEW
Resistances were measured to be different as expected in the past experiment
Some as low as 160 ohms
Perhaps the resistance of the chambers are less than we expected?
Wednesday: July 23, 2008
Started another mtrB culture
To be used as 1 day culture in experiment on Thursday
LabVIEW
Determined that resistance should be measured before connecting to the fuel cells
Resistance of chambers is the same as what we measured initially
Thursday: July 24, 2008
mtrB 1 day vs. 2 day experiment
6 chambers
3 chambers with 1-day old mtrB
3 chambers with 2-day old mtrB
Injected lactate after the initial current spike came down
Hypothesis
2-day cultures will have lower (if any) current production
Friday: July 25, 2008
mtrB: Overnight versus 2 Day Liquid Cultures
What we did:
-Ran 1-day old mtrB versus 2-day old mtrB
Results:
-The shapes of the curves were all very similar.
-Overnight cultures had slightly higher current production than 2-day old cultures.
