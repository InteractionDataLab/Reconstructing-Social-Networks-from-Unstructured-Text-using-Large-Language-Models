Introduction to Synthetic Biology 2008
Hot (and sexy) Yeast
Have you ever forgotten to keep your culture on the stove? Isn´t it annoying to lose several week's work? Tired of apologizing to your boss? WE HAVE THE SOLUTION!!! Valencia iGEM '08 Team heat it up in your lab!!! Besetes en el culete! --- No asustarse, estamos probando colores ---
Main Project - Infector Detector
Infector Detector is a system that will detect the presence of biofilm infections on urinary catheters by reporting on the presence of AHL, a signalling molecule used by E.coli, and output a fluorescent protein as a result. ( more... )
Main Achievements
Designed and modelled a device to detect biofilms and prevent urinary catheter infections like MRSA
Successfully utilized cell-free chassis for Infector Detector
Characterised Infector Detector to detect AHL at ambient temperatures
Compared system expression to AHL Receiver (BBa_F2620) transfer function.
Discount DNA Synthesis from Geneart. iGEM's DNA synthesis partner offers iGEM teams highly discounted DNA synthesis: $0.20 per base and $35 shipping. Check out the resources box for more information.
Are you having trouble transforming your DNA from the 2008 Spring DNA Distribution? Please stay tuned.  We have sent out a hard copy of the first volume of out iGEM Newsletter which has information discussing this with tips on how to get better results.

Specification
Design Solution
System Level
Health & Safety - System must not contain living cells, or cause any harm to patient.
Use a Cell Free System e.g. Promega's S30 Cell Extract
Chassis
Shelf-life - System must have a shelf life of 7 days.
Use a Cell Free System that can be packaged and stored in a -80°C freezer for 7 days.
Chassis
Packaging and Application - System must be applied as a cream or spray.
Package the system in liquid form.
Chassis
Inputs - System must be sensitive to AHL concentration between 5-50nM.
Sensitive AHL receiver to detect low AHL levels - Part no. F2620.
Construct
Outputs - System must give a visual signal if AHL is present.
Couple AHL to a reporter system expressing fluoresent protein eg. RFP
Construct
Operating Conditions - System must operate within temperature 20°-30°C.
Gene expression systems and protein must be thermostable. Characterise a Cell Free System at these temperatures.
Construct & Chassis
Response Time - System needs to have a response time under 3 hours.
To be Determined - this is hard to design for. Protease Inhibitor of Cell Extract should ensure degradation of Visual Reporter is minimal.
