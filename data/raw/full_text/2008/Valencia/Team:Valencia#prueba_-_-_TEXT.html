Hot Yeast
Valencia iGEM '08 Team heats it up in your lab!!!
Tired of forgetting to keep our plates on the stove and therefore losing all of our work we though, wouldn’t it be great to have culture that heats itself up? This idea was the basis for our project.
We aim to express transmembrane protein UCP in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae and be able to record a temperature increase using a calorimeter. In a second phase, we will implement a regulatory system  the temperature from both an upper and lower limit.
