August 1st
- We carried out the experiment with YPKAc Medium . We were just characterizing yeast growth in this medium. In this medium containing acetate, yeast is supposed to only breathe rather than fermenting.
-Team meeting: Checking project progress and planning the following experiments.
August 5th
- Experiment carried out:
       SP medium .
      Four strains.
      No galactose activation.
August 6th
-Trying to find out the best moment for galactose activation....
       YPKAc Medium .
      Galactose activation at two, three and four hours.
      O.D. measured at each time.
August 7th
-We added palmitic acid to see if it had any effect, especially in UCP+ strain. Experiment:
       SP medium .
      Strains UCP-, 76Δ and UCP+ with galactose induction and palmitic acid at 3 hours after inoculating.
      Strain UCP+ just with galactose induction.
August 8th
-We prepared lab material and decided the following experiment we would carry out.
August 9th
-We carried out the experiment changing some variables:
       SP medium .
      Four strains.
      Inoculation at O.D. around 0.2
      Galactose induction 5 hours after inoculating.
August 11th
-The thermocouples inside the calorimeters had been always placed in the upper part, having no contact with the liquid because of contamination reasons. Our engineers team mates suggested it would be better for the thermocouples to be submerged in the liquid. We carried out an experiment to see if there are significant differences:
      Four calorimeters.
      Water inside.
      Two submerged, two just in contact with the air inside the calorimeter.
-Team meeting: Checking project progress.
August 12th
-We had growing problems. Apparently, our cultures were too old...
-We repeated the experiment from yesterday, changing some variables:
      We incremented the shaking.
      We incremented the tilt.
We obtained surprising results, our calorimeters heated the water up!
August 13th
-Still having growing problems.
-We repeated the experiment from yesterday. This time with no so much tilt.
August 14th
-We carried out an experiment both to charazterize yeast growth and to check if the strains behave as they should, since those expresing thermogenine should grow at a lower rate.
      Four strains in Erlenmeyer flash inside the 30ºC shaking stove.
      Galactose induction at O.D. 0.2
      O.D. measurements every one and a half hours.
      250 rpm.
August 15th
-We charactarized yeast growing in the calorimeters, in the same conditions as yesterday.
After the last measurement (9 hours), we induced a second time with 5 ml galactose.
August 18th
-We repeated exactly the same experiment as August 15th, in order to see if we could obtain the same good results.
Initial temperature was lower because we were not able to completely control it.
August 21st
-We were trying to determine the conditions to obtain temperature increase as we did on August 15th:
      Four strains.
      Initial O.D. 0.2
      Galactose at 3 hours.
      250 rpm
August 23rd
-We repeated the experiment from yesterday. Same conditions.
August 25th
-Trying to determine whether we would obtain different results with YPKAc Medium . Experiment:
      175 Δ strain.
      Initial OD 0.2
      Two flasks with SP medium, two flasks with YPKAc.
      For each medium, one of them with galactose induction.
August 27th
-We carried out the following experiment:
      Four strains in LCCs with SP medium .
      Galactose induction at the beginning. Initial O.D. 0,6
      275 rpm.
We had to stop it because one of the LCC was broken.
August 28th
Joaquina's birthday!!
August 29th
-We carried out the experiment again:
      Four strains in LCCs with SP medium .
      Galactose induction at the beginning. Initial O.D. 0,6
      275 rpm.
August 30th
One of the strains was increasing its culture temperature. We decided to leave the experiment a couple more hours.
