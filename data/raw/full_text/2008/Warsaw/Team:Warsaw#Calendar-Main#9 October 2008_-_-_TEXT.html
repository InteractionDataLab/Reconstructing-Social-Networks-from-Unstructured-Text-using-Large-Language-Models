Preparation of vector for pT7 constructs
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inoculated on previous day - pET15b+OmpA_omega (with removed XbaI site).
Control digest of isolated pET15b+OmpA_omega without XbaI plasmids with XbaI and BamHI (Tango buffer). Gel electrophoresis - proper clones found. Fig. 1 .
Digest of pET15b+OmpA_omega without XbaI plasmid with NdeI and SacI (BamHI buffer), dephosphorylation with CIAP
Gel electrophoresis and gel-out of proper band - 6000 bp. Fig. 2 .

Preparation of alpha_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103019)
Michał K.
Ligation of digested pET15b vector (from Preparation of vector for pT7 constructs ) with alpha_linker fragment(from 25 September ) (1 hr).
PCR on above ligation using pETt7L_XNE and AlphaPlinkSac primers  (annealing temperature 58 °C; elongation length 120s) to obtain alpha_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103019) fragment.
Gel electrophoresis of PCR products and gel-out of proper bands ( alpha_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103019) - 800 bp). Fig. 3 .
Overnight digest of purified PCR product EcoRI and SacI (BamHI buffer).

Preparation of omega_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103020)
Michał K.
Ligation of digested pET15b vector (from Preparation of vector for pT7 constructs) with omega_linker fragment(from 30 September ) (1 hr).
PCR on above ligations using pETt7L_XNE and LinP_BS primers (annealing temperature 58 °C; elongation length 120s) to obtain omega_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103020) fragments
Gel electrophoresis of PCR products and gel-out of proper bands (pT7_omega_ - 600 bp). Fig. 3 .
Overnight digest of purified PCR product with EcoRI and BcuI (BamHI buffer).
