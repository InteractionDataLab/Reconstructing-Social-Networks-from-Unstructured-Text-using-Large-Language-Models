MutD5 testing
Piotr
Sequencing results: there weren't any mutations in plasmids isolated from MutD5 - maybe this strain is too weak as a mutator.
Preparation of OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016)
Michał K.
PCR on pACYC177+OmpA_omega_ΔA_alpha plasmid using OmLNXNEB and LinPBSNP primers (annealing temperature 58 °C; elongation length 90s) to obtain OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016) fragment.
Gel electrophoresis of PCR products and gel-out of proper bands (OmpA-linker-omega-linker - 900 bp). Fig. 1 .
Fig. 1. PCR products: lane 2 - Omega_Link, lane 3 - OmpA_Omega_Link.
Preparation of OmpA-linker (BBa_K103006)
Michał K.
Digest of pSB1A3 carrying ΔA (BBa_K103003) plasmid with NdeI and SacI (BamHI buffer). Dephosphorylation (CIAP) of plasmid.
Gel electrophoresis of digested plasmids and gel-out of proper band ( pSB1A3 - 2200 bp). Fig. 2 .
Overnight ligation of isolated DNA fragments: pSB1A3 + OmpA_linker (BBa_K103006) (from 18 September).
Preparation of omega_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103020)

Preparation of Z(BBa_K103004)
Michał K.
Digest of pGeneArt-Z and pSB1A3 carrying ΔA (BBa_K103003) plasmids with NdeI and BcuI (BamHI buffer). Dephosphorylation (CIAP) of plasmid.
Gel electrophoresis of digested plasmids  and gel-out of proper bands (Z - 200 bp and pSB1A3 - 2200 bp). Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 .
Overnight ligation of isolated DNA fragments: pSB1A3 + Z (BBa_K103004) .
