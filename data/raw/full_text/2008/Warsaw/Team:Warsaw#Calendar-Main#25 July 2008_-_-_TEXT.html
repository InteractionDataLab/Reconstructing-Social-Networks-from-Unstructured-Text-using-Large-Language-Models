Cloning of protein Z DNA to pET15b-OmpA-omega in place of OmpA
Paweł
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inoculated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with NdeI and NotI. Two positives obtained (proper band: ~200 bp visible).
One of positive plasmids transformed into TOP10 and plated on LB+amp, overnight, for further isolation of pET15b+Z+omega vector.
Cloning of protein A DNA to OmpA constructs
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day ( pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with BamHI and SacI (BamHI buffer).
Gel electrophoresis - proper clone found.
