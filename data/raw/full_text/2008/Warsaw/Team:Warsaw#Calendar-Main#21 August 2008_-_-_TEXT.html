Isolation of plasmids from above cultures.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with BamHI and SacI.
Gel electrophoresis - all constructs apart from pACYC177+OmpA_alpha were successfully recovered.
Conclusions:
Almost none of tested constructs give resistance to ampicillin without prey protein added to culture medium.
Interaction between hunter and prey is not necessary to make cells ampicillin resistant (OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega grow with prey).
pACYC177+OmpA_alpha culture may be contaminated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, alpha doesn't need interaction of A and Z proteins to bind to omega - maybe we must give bacteria less prey.
Cloning of protein A DNA to GeneArt plasmid
Antoni
Colony PCR on colonies from plates with transformations pGeneart+A .
Primers used: AP+NotI and AL+SacI .
Gel electrophoresis.
Confirmed transformant colonies inoculated to liquid LB with ampicillin.
Cloning of alpha to pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inoculated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with FastBamHI and FastAcc65I (Fast Digest buffer).
Gel electrophoresis - no proper clones found ( Fig. 1. ).
