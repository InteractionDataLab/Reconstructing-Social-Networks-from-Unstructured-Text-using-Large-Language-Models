Tests for ampicillin resistance given by protein added to medium
Piotr
Inoculation of pACYC177+OmpA_variants from previous day to LB + 0.25 mM IPTG, kanamycin and 50 μl/ml ampicillin with minimum concentration of prey (yesterday's results).
Measurement of growth after 6 hours - 2-fold growth increase in presence of interacting proteins ( pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega twice as much as pACYC177+OmpA_omega with protein Z_alpha, pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega twice as much as pACYC177+OmpA_omega with protein A_alpha and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_alpha twice as much as pACYC177+OmpA_alpha with protein Z_omega.)!!!!
We're fighting hard to obtain funds for the visit on iGEM2008 Jamboree!
