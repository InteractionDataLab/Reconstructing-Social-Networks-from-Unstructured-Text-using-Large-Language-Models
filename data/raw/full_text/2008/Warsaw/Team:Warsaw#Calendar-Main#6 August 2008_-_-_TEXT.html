Checking if OmpA_omega_ΔA_alpha gives ampicillin resistance
Piotr, Weronika
Repetition of the test from previous day. Inoculation of OmpA_omega_ΔA_alpha from various IPTG concentrations: 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 mM into same IPTG concentrations, but with various ampicillin concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100 mM) in ratio 1:50.

Conclusion: we obtained the best induction using 0.5 - 0.25 mM IPTG. Best ampicillin concentration is 50 - 75 μg/ml.
