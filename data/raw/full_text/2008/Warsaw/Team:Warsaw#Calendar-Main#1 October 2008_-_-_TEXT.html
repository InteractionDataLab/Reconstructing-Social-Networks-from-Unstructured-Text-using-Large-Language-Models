Preparation of vectors for Biobricks
Michał K., Piotr
Isolation of pSB2K3 and BBa_I739204 (pACYC177 converted into BioBrick vector) plasmids.
Digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and BcuI (BamHI buffer). Dephosphorylation (CIAP) of plasmids.
Gel elctrophoresis and gel-out of proper bands: 4500 bp - pSB2K3 and 3000 bp - BBa_I739204 (pACYC177 converted into BioBrick vector) . Fig. 1 .

Preparation of Z(BBa_K103004)
Michał K.
Inoculation of some colonies from pSB1A3 + Z(BBa_K103004) plate to LB with ampicillin.
Preparation of OmpA_linker_omega_linker under Plac (BBa_K103018)
Michał K.
Addition of 5 μl T4 ligase buffer and 2 μl of T4 ligase to digest of BBa_K103018 fragment. Ligation for 1 hr.
PCR on ligation of OmpA_linker_omega_linker under Plac (BBa_K103018) fragment using PlacL_XNE and LinP_BS primers (annealing temperature 58 °C; elongation length 90s) to obtain BBa_K103018 fragment without internal EcoRI site (Przanowski's method of removing internal restriction site).
Gel electrophoresis of PCR product and gel-out of proper bands (BBa_K103018 - 1200 bp). Fig. 2 .

Preparation of AID(BBa_K103001)
Michał K.
PCR on pMPMT5+AID plasmid using AIDl and AIDP_SpeNotPst primers (annealing temperature 58 °C; elongation length 60s) to obtain AID(BBa_K103001) fragment.
Gel electrophoresis of PCR product and gel-out of proper bands (AID(BBa_K103001) - 600 bp). Fig. 2 .
Digest of PCR product with XbaI and PstI (Tango buffer).
