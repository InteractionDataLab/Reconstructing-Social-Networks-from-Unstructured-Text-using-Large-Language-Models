Mutagenesis of protein A
Paweł
Isolation of plasmid DNA from overnight cultures (it was really hard work...).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with KpnI and BamHI (if mutagenesis really occured, ~550bp band should be visible).
Results of digest:
ADelL+KpnI and ADelP primers mutagenesis:
pACYClac+ompA-ΔA-omega : 0 positive, 5 negative
pACYClac+ompa-ΔA-alpha : 3 positive, 7 negative
pACYClac+OmpA-omega-ΔA : 1 positive, 2 negative
AMutL+KpnI and AMutP mutagenesis:
pACYClac+ompA-ΔA-omega : 4 positive, 16 negative
pACYClac+ompa-ΔA-alpha : 4 positive, 8 negative
pACYClac+OmpA-omega-ΔA : 2 positive, 15 negative
Plasmids which gave positive digest results prepared for sequencing (one sample from each variant which gave positive result).
