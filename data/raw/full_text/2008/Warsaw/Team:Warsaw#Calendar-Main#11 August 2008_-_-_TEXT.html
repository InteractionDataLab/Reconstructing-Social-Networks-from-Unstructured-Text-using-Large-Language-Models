Checking whether degradation of the fusions with OmpA is caused by Lon and OmpT proteases (present in TOP10 )
Piotr, Weronika
Test was conducted in E.coli Rosetta strain expressing OmpA_omega_ΔA_alpha (with and without induction) and OmpA_A_alpha .
Spinning.
Suspending.
Adding the lysis buffer.
Boiling.
Putting into poliacrylamide gel.
Transfer onto nitrocellulose.
Blocking.
Anti-A antibody binding.
Washing.
Anti-rabbit antibody binding.
Developing with BCIP and NBT ( Fig. 1. ).
Fig. 1. Detection of protein A in bacterial lysates.
1 - protein marker,
2 - E. coli without plasmid,
3, 4, 5, 6 - Omp_omega_A_alpha fusion protein:
3 - in Top10 strain with 1 mM IPTG,
4 - in Top10 strain with 0.5 mM IPTG,
5 - in Rosetta strain with 1 mM IPTG
6 - in Rosetta strain with 0.5 mM IPTG,
7 - in Rosetta strain with 0.25 mM IPTG,
8, 9, 10 - Omp_A_alpha fusion protein:
8 - in Top10 strain with 1mM IPTG,
9 - in Rosetta strain with 1mM IPTG,
10 - in Rosetta strain with 0.5 mM IPTG,
We didn't observe differences in expression and degradation in Rosettas nor in TOP10 . Therefore we suppose that degradation of the fusions is caused by factor other than Lon and OmpT proteases.
Purification of proteins: Z-alpha and Z-omega
Emilia
100 ml of medium inoculated with overnight culture, then used as inoculum for 1 l culture in presence of ampicillin, kanamycin and IPTG (according to protocol ).
