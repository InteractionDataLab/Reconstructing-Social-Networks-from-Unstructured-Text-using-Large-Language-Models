Cloning of protein Z DNA to OmpA constructs
Michał K.
Two colonies ( pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega ) were inoculated to liquid LB with kanamycin.
Cloning omega-A fusion on pKS (second attempt)
Michał L., Ewa, Marcin
Polymerase Chain Ligation on linker-A and omega-linker
reisolated PCR product omega-linker - 4 µl
reisolated PCR product linker-A - 13.5 µl
primer OmegaL+SacI - 2 µl
primer AP+NotI - 2 µl
Pfu buffer with Mg2+ - 5 µl
dNTPs - 1 µl
H2o - 22 µl

gel electrophoresis of products
Preparation of alpha+A conctruct
Antoni
Gradient PCR on alpha+A PCR products with AlphaL+SacI and AP+NotI primers.
Gel electrophoresis. Again without satisfying results.
Third PCR on alpha+A. This time two temperatures of annealing (68°C and 72°C) and gradient of DMSO.
Gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1. ).
Gel-out of proper 1000 bp band.
Fig. 1.Gradient PCR on alpha+A products. Lanes 1-3, 5, 6 - annealing temperature 68°C and DMSO concentration of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% respectively. Lanes 7-11 - 72°C and DMSO concentration increasing in the same maner. Lane 4 and 12 GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix 1 μg and 0.5 μg respectively.
