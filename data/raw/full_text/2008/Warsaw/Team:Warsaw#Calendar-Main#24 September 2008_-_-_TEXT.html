MutD5 testing
Emilia
Inoculation MutD5 from previous day to new medium (liquid LB + 0.25mM IPTG + kanamycin + tetracyclin + 50 μl/ml + prey)
6 hours culture
Inoculation MutD5 from the morning to new medium (liquid LB + 0.25mM IPTG + kanamycin + tetracyclin + 50 μl/ml + prey)
Mutagenesis of protein A
Paweł
Results of mutagenesis: no colonies on any plate.
Mutagenesis repeated with modified conditions: fresh stock of dNTPs used and additional MgCl2 added.
Preparation of alpha_A construct
Antoni
PCR on pKS plasmid containing protein A with AL+link10+homo2 and AP+NotI primers and 10% DMSO(20 cycles, elongation 40 s, annealing temperature 72°C).
PCR on pUC19 plasmid with AlphaL+SacI and AlphaP+link10+homo2 primers (20 cycles, elongation 45 s, annealing temperature 63°C).
As a result we got two PCR products (alpha-linker and linker-A) wich will be utilized as templates in next PCR.
Gel electrophoresis of PCR products and gel-out of proper bands (alpha_linker - 570 bp and linker_A - 470 bp ).
Measurment of concentration of both isolated products.
Preparation of ΔA (BBa_K103003)
Piotr
E. coli TOP10 transformation with overnight ligation of pSB1A3 and ΔA DNA fragments.
Plating on LB + ampicillin.
