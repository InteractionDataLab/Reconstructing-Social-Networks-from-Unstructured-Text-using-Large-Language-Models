Wiki scripting
Michał L.
Since almost none of useful calendar functionality has been ported form openwetware.org to this wiki. I' ve added 'Previous entry' and 'Next entry' navigation links. They are AJAX driven and are handled 100% on client side (thus using them generates lots of unneeded server traffic), so this is not an optimal solution but it is the only one when you have access only to pages not to the wiki engine.
