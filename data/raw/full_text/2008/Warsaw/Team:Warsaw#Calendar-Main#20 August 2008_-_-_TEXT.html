Tests for ampicillin resistance given by protein added to medium
Piotr
Inoculation of all pACYC177-OmpA variants of constructs to LB + 0.25 mM IPTG, kanamycin, ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and 100 μg/ml of protein (Z-alpha and Z-omega; negative control without protein).
Measurement of growth after 5 hours and on next day.
Cloning of protein A DNA to GeneArt plasmid
Antoni
Transformation of E. coli TOP10 strain with ligation products from previous day.
Cloning of alpha to pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega
Michał K.
Colonies from both plates( pACYC177+OmpA_alpha_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_alpha_Z_omega ) was inoculated to liquid LB with kanamycin (only two colonies have grown on each plate).
