MutD5 testing
Piotr
Inoculation MutD5 carrying: pACYC177+OmpA_Z_alpha , pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega , pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_omega_ΔA to liquid LB + 0.25mM IPTG + kanamycin + 50 μl/ml + prey:
Z_alpha for pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega
Z_omega for pACYC177+OmpA_Z_alpha
A_apha for pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega
A_alpha for pACYC177+OmpA_omega_ΔA
Mutagenesis of protein A
Paweł
PNK phosporylation of mutagenesis products for 30 min at 37°C.
PNK heat-inactivated by incubation at 75°C for 15 min.
T4 ligase added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.
T4 ligase inactivated by incubation at 55°C for 20 min, then 5U of DpnI added and incubated at 37°C for 3 hours.
After DpnI treatment mutagenesis products transformed into TOP10 and plated on LB + kanamycin plates.
Preparation of ΔA (BBa_K103003)
Michał K.
