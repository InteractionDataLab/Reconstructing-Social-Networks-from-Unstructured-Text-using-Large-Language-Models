Digest of pGeneart+A and pET15b+OmpA-alpha with NdeI and NotI (Orange buffer), pET15b was also dephosphorylated .
Gel electrophoresis of digested plasmids ( Fig. 1. ) and gel-out of proper bands (400 bp for A lane and 6200 bp for pET15b lane).
Ligation of pET15b-Alpha and A .
Transformation of E. coli TOP10 .
