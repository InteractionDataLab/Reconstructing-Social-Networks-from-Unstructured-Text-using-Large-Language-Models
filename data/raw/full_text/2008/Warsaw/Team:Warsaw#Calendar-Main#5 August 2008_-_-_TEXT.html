Checking if OmpA_omega_ΔA_alpha gives ampicillin resistance
Piotr, Weronika
Inoculation OmpA_omega_ΔA_alpha from various IPTG concentrations (in mmol/mL) (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) into same IPTG concentrations, but with various ampicillin concentrations (in mmol/mL)(25, 50, 75, 100) in ratio: 1:50.
