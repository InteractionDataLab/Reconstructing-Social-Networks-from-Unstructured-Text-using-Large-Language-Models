Tests for ampicillin resistance given by protein added to medium
Piotr
Purification pACYC177+OmpA_alpha from antibiotic resistance contamination:
Inoculation of E. coli TOP10 carrying pACYC177+OmpA_alpha to liquid LB with kanamycin and with kanamycin and ampicillin.
Inoculation of all pACYC177+OmpA variants of constructs to LB + 0.25 mM IPTG, kanamycin, ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and 50 μg/ml of protein (Z_alpha and Z_omega; negative control without protein).
Measurement of growth after 5 hours and on next day.
Cloning of protein A DNA to pET15b+OmpA-alpha plasmid
Antoni
Colony PCR on colonies from plates with transformations pGeneart+A Primers used: AP+NotI and AL+SacI.
Lack of confirmed transformant colonies.
Cloning of alpha to pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day (both potential constructs).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with FastBamHI and FastAcc65I (Fast Digest buffer).
Gel electrophoresis - still no proper clones found.
