Wiki scripting
Michał L.
I've created a script that is kind of interactive table of contents of our Notebook. It also allows easy checking "who done what" so we can be very precise about contributions of all team members to our project. As usual it's AJAX driven (client side, with lots of unnecessary traffic) and IMHO should be handled on server side (via simple database query). Anyway I hope that using this script we can make our wiki more ordered.
