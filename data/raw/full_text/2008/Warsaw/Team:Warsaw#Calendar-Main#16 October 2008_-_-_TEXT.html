Preparation of linker_alpha (BBa_K103009)
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from culture inoculated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis -  proper clones found. Fig. 1 .

Preparation of AID under pBAD/araC (BBa_K103002)
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from culture inoculated on previous day ( pSB1A3 + AID under pBAD/araC (BBa_K103002) ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - still no proper clones found. Fig. 2 .
Repetition of overnight ligation of isolated DNA fragments: pSB1A3 + AID under pBAD/araC (BBa_K103002) .

Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from culture inoculated on previous day - pSB2K3 + OmpA_linker_alpha_linker under Plac (BBa_K103017)
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - we found good clones. Fig. 1 .
