Cloning of alpha to pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day.
Digest of isolated plasmids with SacI (SacI buffer), vectors were also dephosphorylated with CIAP.
Gel electrophoresis and gel-out of proper bands 4400 bp (for pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega ) and 4200 bp ( pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega ).
Purification of proteins: Z-alpha and Z-omega
Piotr
Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel (12 %) of sonicate and preliminarily purified protein fusions: Z-alpha and Z-omega ( Fig. 1. and Fig. 2. )
