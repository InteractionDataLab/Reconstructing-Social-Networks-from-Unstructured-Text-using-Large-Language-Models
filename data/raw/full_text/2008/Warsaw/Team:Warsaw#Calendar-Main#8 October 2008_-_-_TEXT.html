Preparation of linker_alpha (BBa_K103009)
Piotr
Isolation of plasmid from culture inoculated on previous day ( pSB2K3 + linker_alpha (BBa_K103009) ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - still no proper clones found.
Preparation of linker_omega (BBa_K103013)
Piotr
Isolation of plasmid from culture inoculated on previous day ( pSB2K3 + linker_omega (BBa_K103013) ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - proper clones found. Fig. 1 .

2-3. Control EcoRI/PstI digests of pSB2K3+linker_omega (BBa_K103013)
Preparation of OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016)
Piotr
Isolation of plasmid from culture inoculated on previous day ( pACYC177 + OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016) ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - no proper clones found.
