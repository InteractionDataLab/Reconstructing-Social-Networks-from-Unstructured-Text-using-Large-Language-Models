Change of the reporter from pZC320 with B-galactosidase to GFP or RFP
Piotr, Weronika
Inoculation of 10ml LB with E.coli TOP10 carrying pZC.
Isolation and chemotransformation with pSB1A2 standard plasmids carrying parts: BBa_E0840 (GFP genetrator) and BBa_J04450 (RFP generator).
Plating of chemotransformants on LB+ampicillin.
Preparation of constructs: OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega
Michał K.
Repetition of PCRs and gel-out purifications from 16 June.
Preparation of alpha-A and omega-A fusions
Michał L. Marcin and Ewa
We've run gradient PCR to obtain Alpha-link and link-A.
DNA template: pDRIVE-TAPTAG
Taq polymerase
buffer suplemented with (NH4)2SO4
MgCl2 concentration gradient (from 1 to 4 mM)
annealing temp 55°C
elongation time 1 - 2 minutes
We have successfully amplified Alpha-link and link-A ( Fig. 1 ). Now it's time for PCL (Polymerase Chain Ligation) to create fusions  Alpha-A and Omega-A.
Fig. 1. PCR product - link-A.
