Preparation of pMPMT5+AID construct
Piotr, Weronika
Preparation of electro- and chemocompetent bacteria E. coli TOP10.
Setup of overnight cultures ( pTrc99A-AID , pMPM-T5 , pZC320 ) on LB broth with proper antibiotics.
Preparation of pMPMT5-AID+T7 and pMPMT5+AID-T7
Michał L.
Isolation of genomic DNA (E.coli Rosetta and TOP10 ) - template DNA for PCR to obtain T7 polymerase DNA. DNA isolated from E. coli TOP10 strain was used as a negative control for PCR. Fig. 1 .
Fig. 1. Probes of isolated genomic DNA after mechanical shearing by pipetting. Without shearing the DNA wouldn't be visible in this kind of gel because genomic DNA is too big. 1 and 3-E.coli Rosetta DNA; 2-DNA ladder; 4-E.coli TOP10 DNA.
