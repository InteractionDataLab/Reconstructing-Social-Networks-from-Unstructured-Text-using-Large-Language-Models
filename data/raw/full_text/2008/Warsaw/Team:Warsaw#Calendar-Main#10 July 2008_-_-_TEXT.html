Preparation of construct pKS with A protein
Michał L., Marcin
Inactivation of restriction enzymes and CIAP.
Ligation of digested PCR product and pKS for 2h at room temperature.
Transformation of E. coli TOP10 strain with 7 µl of ligation mix.
Transformants plating on LB + ampicillin + X-gal + IPTG.
Cloning of protein Z DNA to pET15b-OmpA-alpha in place of OmpA
Piotr, Antoni
Result of ligation of pET15b-OmpA-alpha with protein Z DNA: 16 colonies grown.
Each colony cultured overnight in LB + ampicilin.
Preparation of constructs: OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega #2
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with BamHI and NotI (BamHI buffer).
Gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1. ) - we confirmed pACYC177 + OmpA_omega . We didn't obtain pACYC177 + OmpA_alpha probably because of a mistake in plating.
Ligation of pACYC177 and OmpA_alpha (1 hr).
Transformation of E. coli TOP10 strain with ligation products: pACYC177 and OmpA_alpha .
Transformants plating on LB + kanamycin.
