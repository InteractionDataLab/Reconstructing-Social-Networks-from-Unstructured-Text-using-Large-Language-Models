Purification of proteins: Z-alpha and Z-omega
Piotr, Emilia, Weronika
pET15b+Z_alpha and pET15b+Z_omega in Rosetta strain from overnight culture inoculated in fresh LB and cultured until OD=0,5.
Cultures induced with different concentrations of IPTG in 22°C and 37°C.
Samples were collected twice: after 3h and next day (samples were centrifuged and frozen).
Cloning of omega_ΔA DNA fragment to pACYC177+OmpA_alpha
Michał K.
Separate transformant colonies (tranformation of ligation of pACYC177+OmpA_alpha and omega_ΔA from previous day) inoculated to liquid LB with kanamycin.
Cloning of truncated fragment of protein A (ΔA)
Michał K.
Optimization of PCR to obtain truncated fragment of protein A DNA.
Primers: AL+SacI AP+NotI
Template DNA: pDRIVE-TapTag
Elongation time: 30s
- Optimization of annealing temperature (gradient from 55°C to 75°C). Fig. 1 .
- Optimization of number of cycles(15, 20, 25, 30, 35). Fig. 2 .
PCR to obtain truncated A protein DNA fragment.
Primers: AL+SacI AP+NotI

Gel electrophoresis and gel-out of 250 bp band. Fig. 3 .
Digest of isolated PCR product, pACYC177+OmpA_alpha and pACYC177+OmpA_omega with NotI and SacI (BamHI buffer). pACYC177 vectors were also dephosphorylated .
