Piotr, Emilia
pET15b+Z-alpha and pET15b+Z-omega inoculated for overnight culture (Rosetta strain).
Checking whether degradation of the fusions with OmpA is caused by Lon and OmpT proteases (present in TOP10 )

Separate transformant colonies (Rosetta transformation from previous day) inoculated to liquid LB with kanamycin.
Preparing pACYC177+OmpA_omega_ΔA construct
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inoculated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmids ( pACYC177+omega_ΔA ) with HindIII and SacI (BamHI buffer)( Fig. 1. ). 7 from 8 colonies confirmed.
