Preparation of linker_alpha (BBa_K103009)
Michał K., Piotr
Isolation of plasmid from culture inoculated on previous day ( pSB2K3 + linker_alpha (BBa_K103009) ).
Control digest of isolated plasmid with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - no proper clones found. Fig. 1 .
Inoculation of few more colonies which grown on plate with transformation: pSB2K3 + linker_alpha (BBa_K103009) to liquid LB + kanamycin.
