Cloning of protein Z DNA to pET15b-OmpA-omega in place of OmpA
Paweł
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with NdeI and NotI (Orange buffer). Zero positive results obtained - just empty vectors.
Another overnight ligation of pET15b-OmpA-omega (NdeI/NotI cut) with protein Z DNA.
Cloning omega-A fusion on pKS (second attempt)
Michał L., Ewa, Marcin
We have obtained white colonies of transformants and inoculated 10 of them on liquid LB+Amp100.
Cloning of protein A DNA to OmpA constructs
Michał K.
Colony PCR on colonies from plates with transformations pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_A_alpha . Primers used: AL+SacI and AP+NotI.
Gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1. ).
Confirmed transformant colonies (found only on pACYC177+OmpA_A_alpha plate) inoculated to liquid LB with kanamycin.
