Change of the reporter from pZC320 with B-galactosidase to GFP or RFP
Piotr, Weronika
There were blue and white colonies but no red or green fluorescence in UV.
Inoculation of liquid LB medium + Amp with white colonies.
Preparation of constructs on pET15b: OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega
Paweł
Colonies from each transformant strain from previous day ( pET15b+OmpA_alpha and pET15b+OmpA_omega ) were inoculated to liquid LB + ampicillin.
Cloning alpha-A and omega-A fusions on pKS
Michał L., Ewa, Marcin
We have received sequencing results: A is OK but in case of Alpha-A and Omega-A the result is weird. It seems that there were error in synthesis of OmegaP+link10+homo2 and AlphaP+link10+homo2 primers which causes frameshift and cloning of these fusions has to be repeated from the beginning.
