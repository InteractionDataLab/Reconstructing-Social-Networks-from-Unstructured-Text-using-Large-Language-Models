MutD5 testing
Piotr
Inoculation of MutD5 carrying: pACYC177+OmpA_Z_alpha , pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega , pACYC177+Omp_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_omega_ΔA + induction using 0.25mM IPTG.
'Hunter and prey' system tests: Competition tests
Emilia
Plasmid isolation from 19 September cultures.
Digest with SacI and BamHI.
Electrophoresis ( Fig. 1. ) .
Fig. 1. Results of the second competition test.
1 - Insert from isolated plasmid refers to OmpA_A_Omega
(Z_Alpha protein added to the medium),
2 - Insert from isolated plasmid refers to OmpA_A_Alpha
(Z_Omega protein added to the medium),
3 - Insert from isolated plasmid refers to OmpA_Z_Omega
(A_Alpha protein added to the medium),
4 - DNA ladder.
Conclusion: cells with interacting protein survive competition!
Mutagenesis of protein A
Paweł
Mutagenesis of protein A was performed using 2 pairs of primers: ADelL+KpnI and ADelP (deletion of aminoacids involved in interaction with protein Z) and AMutL+KpnI and AMutP (changing of few aminoacids involved in interaction with protein Z).
Mutagenesis was performed on 3 vectors: pACYClac+ompA-ΔA-omega , pACYClac+ompa-ΔA-alpha and pACYClac+ ompa-omega-ΔA .
Each mutagenesis was performed using each primer at final concentration 0.1 μM, dNTPs at final concentration 0.25 μM and Walk (Pfu) polymerase (shipped by A&A Biotechnology ), with 100 ng of DNA template.
PCR program (15 cycles):
94°C 5 min  94°C 30 s 55°C 30 s 72°C 10 min  72°C 8 min  4°C hold
Preparation of ΔA (BBa_K103003)
Michał K.
Inoculation of only one colony which grown from transformation ( 19 September ) - pSB1A3 + ΔA plasmid into liquid LB + ampicillin.
