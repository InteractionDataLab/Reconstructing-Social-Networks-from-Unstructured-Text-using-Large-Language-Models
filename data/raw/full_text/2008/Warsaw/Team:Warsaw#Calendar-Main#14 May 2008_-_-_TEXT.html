Preparation of pMPMT5+AID construct
Michał K.
Isolation of hypothetical pMPM-T5+AID plasmids from cultures inoculated on previous day.
Restriction digest of plasmids with HindIII and NcoI (1xTango buffer) - construct control.
Gel electrophoresis - choice of proper clones (all checked colonies). Fig. 1 .
Fig. 1. 1-DNA ladder; 2 to 9-plasmids isolated from colonies of transformants and digested with HindIII and NcoI
Preparation of pMPMT5-AID+T7 and pMPMT5+AID-T7
Michał K.
Optimization of conditions for PCR - T7 RNA polymerase for translation fusion; annealing temperature gradient (from 62°C to 82°C); Taq polymerase with supplemented buffer (Łukasz Banasiak helped us with that problematic PCR).
Primers: T7lLinkB T7pXbSal
Template DNA: E. coli Rosetta genomic DNA
Elongation time: 4 minutes
20 cycles
Gel electrophoresis of PCR products.
