Isolation of hypothetical pMPM-T5 with transcriptional fusion .
Isolation of hypothetical pMPM-T5 with translational fusion .
Control digest of pMPM-T5 with transcriptional fusion with EcoRI (EcoRI buffer).
Control digest of pMPM-T5 with translational fusion with BamHI (BamHI buffer).
Gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ).
Choice of proper clones and preparation for sequencing.
Fig. 1. Here we found the clone with translational fusion on pMPM. These are different isolations in each lane. We have been working with the AT6 ever since.
Digest was conducted with BamHI
Fig. 2. 2 to 6 - Control digests of few clones with transcriptional fusion;
7 - pMPMT5-AID; all plasmids digested with EcoRI.
