Fig. 1.Protein A detection on the surface of bacteria.
1 - E. coli expressing OmpA_Omega_A_Alpha,
2 - E. coli expressing OmpA_Z_Omega (antibodies binds to protein Z probably due to similarity of protein A and Z),
3 - E. coli expressing OmpA_A_Alpha,
4 - E. coli carrying OmpA_Omega_A_Alpha without inducer,
5 - E. coli expressing OmpA_A_Omega,
6 - E. coli Top10 without plasmid.
Cloning of alpha to pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega
Michał K.
Inoculation of pACYC177+OmpA_A_omega and pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega plasmids to LB with kanamycin.
