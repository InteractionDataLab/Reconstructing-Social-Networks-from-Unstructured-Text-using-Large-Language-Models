Mutagenesis of protein A
Paweł
Results of mutageneses:
ADelL+KpnI and ADelP primers mutagenesis:
pACYClac+OmpA-ΔA-omega : 5 colonies
pACYClac+OmpA-ΔA-alpha : 10 colonies
pACYClac+OmpA-omega-ΔA : 3 colonies
AMutL+KpnI and AMutP mutagenesis:
pACYClac+OmpA-ΔA-omega : 20 colonies
pACYClac+Ompa-ΔA-alpha : 12 colonies
pACYClac+OmpA-omega-ΔA : 17 colonies
Each colony cultured overnight in LB + kanamycin for further analyses.
Preparation of ΔA (BBa_K103003)
