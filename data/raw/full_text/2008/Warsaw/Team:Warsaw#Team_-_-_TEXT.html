Team:Warsaw/Team
From 2008.igem.org
We heard about iGEM from UW alumni doing their PhD thesis abroad. Few people were interested in participating and started to form the team late autumn 2007. The basic idea of our project was developed and selected from many others during one of the brainstorms on our campus. Having the project idea our group started to grow and we needed to find a supervisor. After a debate we have chosen prof. Jacek Bielecki from Applied Microbiology department, who enthusiastically supported our idea of participation in iGEM'08. During next few months we got support from authorities of our faculty and we were ready to start raising funds. In the meantime more people have joined our group. In may we have begun work on our project.
