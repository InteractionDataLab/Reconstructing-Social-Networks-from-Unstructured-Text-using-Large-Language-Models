Preparation of construct pKS with A protein
Michał L., Ewa, Marcin
Isolation of plasmid DNA from cultures inocluated on previous day.
Control digest of isolated plasmid with SacI and NotI (BamHI buffer) - 2 h.
Gel electrophoresis of digested DNA.
We are glad to find the proper clone and inoculate liquid LB with ampicillin to freeze bacteria carrying pKS-A construct.
Cloning of protein Z DNA to pET15b-OmpA-alpha in place of OmpA
Piotr, Antoni
Control digest of isolated plasmids with NdeI and NotI. Two positives obtained (proper band: ~200 bp visible).
One of positive plasmids transformed into TOP10 and plated on LB+amp, overnight, for further isolation of pET15b+Z+alpha vector.
Preparation of constructs: OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega #2
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day ( pCACYC177 + OmpA_alpha ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with BamHI and SacI (BamHI buffer).
Gel electrophoresis - we found good clones ( Fig. 1. ).
