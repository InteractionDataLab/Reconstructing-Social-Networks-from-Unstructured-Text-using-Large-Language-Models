Purification of proteins: A-alpha
Piotr, Emilia
Samples were resuspended in PBS, sonicated and centrifuged.
Lysis buffer was added separately to pellet and supernatant, then samples were boiled for 10 min.
Lysates were loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gel ( Fig. 1. ) (amount relating to 100 μl of OD=1.0 culture).
Gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Optimal induction conditions chosen.
A-alpha in Rosetta strain was cultured overnight.
