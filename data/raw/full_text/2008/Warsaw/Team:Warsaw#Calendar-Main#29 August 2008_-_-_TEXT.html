Purification of proteins: A-alpha
Piotr
Transformation of Rosetta with pET15b+A-alpha plasmid. Plating on LB with chloramphenicol and ampicillin.
Blue-white screening and rifampicin test in GM2163
Michał L.
GM2163 competent cells carrying pZC320 were transformed with following plasmids:
pMPMT5-omega ,
pMPMT5-AID ,
pMPMT5-AIDT7 ,
pMPMT5-AID+T7 .
Transformants were selected on CTAXI plates (LB + Chloramphenicol + Tetracycline + IPTG + Ampicillin 30 μg/mL + X-Gal) because GM2163 are chloramphenicol resistant.
Cloning of protein A DNA to pET15b+OmpA-alpha plasmid
Michał K.
Isolation of pET15b+A-alpha plasmids.
Control digest of isolated plasmids with XbaI and BamHI (Tango buffer).
Gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 1. ). Choice of proper clone.
Fig. 1. Control XbaI/BamHI digests of  plasmids isolated from transformants with colony PCR product.
