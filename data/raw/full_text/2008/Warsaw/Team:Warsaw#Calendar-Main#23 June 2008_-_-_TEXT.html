Blue/white and rifampicin test #2
Piotr
Analysis of lacZ sequence from pZC320 :
There is no mutation in lacZ gene. Why are the colonies white? Reason of white phenotype unknown; this might be chromosomal mutation, transcription supression or something else).
Preparation of constructs: OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega
Michał K.
Inoculation other separate transformant colonies from plates with ligations: pACYC177+OmpA_alpha and pACYC177+OmpA_omega (liquid LB + kanamycin).
Preparation of alpha-A and omega-A fusions
Michał L.
We have successfully amplified Omega-linker ( Fig. 1 ), but were unable to obtain the other. two PCRs were repeated. New annealing temp.: 48°C. Mg2+ concentration elevated to 4 mM.
Fig. 1.PCR products. Lane 1 - lack of product for A-linker; lane 3 - product for Omega-linker.
