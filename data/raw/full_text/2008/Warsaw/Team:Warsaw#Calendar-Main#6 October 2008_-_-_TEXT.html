Preparation of linker_alpha (BBa_K103009)
Michał K.
Colony PCR with LinLSXNE and AlphaPSpe primers on colonies from plates with transformations pSB1A3 + linker_alpha (BBa_K103009) (annealing temperature - 55°C,60 s of elongation step). No visible bands for proper product ( Fig. 1 ).
Inoculation of some colonies which grown on plate - pSB2K3 + linker_alpha (BBa_K103009) to liquid LB + kanamycin.

Preparation of linker_omega (BBa_K103013)
Michał K.
Inoculation of some colonies which grown on plate - pSB2K3 + linker_omega (BBa_K103013) to liquid LB + kanamycin.
Preparation of OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016)
Michał K.
Colony PCR with OmpaL_N and OmpaP_link primers on colonies from plates with transformations pACYC177 + OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016) (annealing temperature - 55°C,90 s of elongation step). No visible bands for proper product ( Fig. 2 ).
Inoculation of some colonies which grown on plate transformation: pACYC177 + OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016) to liquid LB + kanamycin.

Preparation of OmpA_linker_omega_linker under Plac (BBa_K103018)
Michał K.
Overnight ligation of isolated DNA fragments pSB2K3 (from 1 October ) + OmpA_linker_omega_linker under Plac (BBa_K103018) (without EcoRI site).
Preparation of AID(BBa_K103001)
Michał K.
