Preparation of OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016)
Piotr
Inoculation of few more colonies from plate with ligation of pACYC177 + OmpA-linker-omega-linker (BBa_K103016) (from 16 October ) to LB with kanamycin.
Preparation of alpha_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103019)
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inoculated on previous day ( pSB2K3 + alpha_linker under PT7 (BBa_K103019) ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with EcoRI and PstI (Orange buffer). Gel electrophoresis - proper clones found. Fig. 1 .
