Cloning omega-A fusion on pKS (second attempt)
Michał L., Ewa, Marcin
We have massive outbreak of some virulent bacteriophage strain in our lab. All our current E. coli cultures are gone :-(. Until we get rid of the phage there will be no microbiological work in our lab. Sorry.
Cloning of protein Z DNA to OmpA constructs
Michał K.
Isolation of plasmids from cultures inocluated on previous day ( pACYC177+OmpA_Z_omega ).
Control digest of isolated plasmids with BamHI and SacI (BamHI buffer).
Gel electrophoresis - both checked colones are good ( Fig. 1. ).
