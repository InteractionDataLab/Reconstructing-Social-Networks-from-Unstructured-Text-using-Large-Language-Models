Preparation of constructs: OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega #2
Piotr, Weronika
It's the second attempt to clone OmpA_alpha and OmpA_omega to pACYC177, but now thank's to Paweł we've got both fusions on pET15b.
Digest of confirmed clones of pET15b+OmpA_alpha and pET15b+OmpA_omega with NdeI and BamHI (Tango 2x buffer).
Digest of pACYC177 plasmid with NdeI and BamHI (Tango 2x buffer), dephosphorylation with CIAP .
Gel electrophoresis of digested plasmids and gel-out of proper bands (OmpA_alpha- 1000 bp, OmpA_omega - 800 bp).
Electrophoresis of gel-out products.
Overnight ligation of pACYC177 and OmpA_alpha.
Overnight ligation of pACYC177 and OmpA_omega.
Cloning omega-A fusion on pKS (second attempt)
Michał L., Ewa, Marcin
We have just received corrected version of omegaP-link10-homo2 primer. Let's hope this time everything will be fine. We are repeating the PCRs:
