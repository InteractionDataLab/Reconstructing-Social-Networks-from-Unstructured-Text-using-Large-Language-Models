Purification of proteins: Z-alpha and Z-omega
Piotr, Emilia
Samples were resuspended in PBS, sonicated and centrifuged.
Lysis buffer was added separately to pellet and supernatant, then samples were boiled for 10 min.
Lysates loaded on 12% poliacrylamide gel (amount relating to 100 μl of OD=1.0 culture).
Gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Optimal induction conditions chosen ( Fig. 2. and Fig. 3. ).

The arrow shows place of our overexpressed protein:
1. 22°C 0.5 mM IPTG
2. 22°C 0.1 mM IPTG
3. 22°C 1 mM IPTG
4. Marker
5. negative control
6. 37°C 0.1 mM IPTG
7. 37°C 0.5 mM IPTG
8. 37°C 1 mM IPTG
