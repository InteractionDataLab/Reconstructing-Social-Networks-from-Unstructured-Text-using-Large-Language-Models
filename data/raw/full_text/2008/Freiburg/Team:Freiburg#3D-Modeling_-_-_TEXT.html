DNA-Origami
Planning the input pattern on the DNA-Origami surface, we generated various 3D-models of the huge molecule using NanoEngineer , Pymol and SwissPdbViewer (both freeware). Some of those models are shown here to give you an impression of the molecules we have engineered this year.

Fig.3: Oligo-pattern with scale and two fragments (distance estimation model, distances given in Ångstrom)
Fig.4: Oligo-pattern with scale and two T-Cell-receptors (distance estimation model, distances given in Ångstrom)
Fig.5: Oligo-pattern with NIP-molecules and Fab-fragment, binding accessibility estimation model
Fusion Proteins
The pictures below show models of the fusion proteins of our composite parts Bba_K157032 and Bba_K157033 code for (generated with "SwissPdbViewer"):
Fig.6: Red: LipocalinFluA, Grey: "Transmembrane region (BCR, no structural data; symbolized by helix), Blue:left: Split-Cerulean (CFP), N-terminal fragment; right: Split-Cerulean (CFP), C-terminal fragment
Following pdb-files have been used to generate the models: Cerulean-CFP: 2Q57
Venus-YFP: 1MYW
Engineered Lipocalin: 1n0s
B1-8 Fv-Fragment:1a6w
