labs
The permanent host of the iGEM activities were the labs of Kristian Müller and Katja Arndt, who provided a dedicated bench and desks, as well all lab equipment for cloning, E. coli culture, human cell culture, standard microscopy, as well as computers and space for all meetings. The lab of Wolfgang Schamel contributed the T- and B-cell lines. For special analyses we ventured to the following places: atomic force microscopy: lab of Svetlana Santer, Institute for Microsystems Technology (IMTEK), University of Freiburg;  confocal microscopy, Ca2+ imaging: Imaging Core Facility of the Center of Systems Biology (ZBSA), University of Freiburg; FACS: Max-Planck-Institute for Immunobiology, Freiburg; advanced microscopy: lab of Ralf Baumeister and Ralf Reski, Department of Biology, University of Freiburg.
