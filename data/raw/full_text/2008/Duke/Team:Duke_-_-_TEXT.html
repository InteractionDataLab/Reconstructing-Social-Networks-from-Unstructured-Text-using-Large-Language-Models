About Us
This year has been going pretty good so far for the Duke iGEM team.  For the first time in who knows when the Duke Football team isn't the laughingstock of the entire college football world, there hasn't been an ethidium bromide disaster this year, and most importantly iGEM 2008 is coming up!
That being said, this year has not been without strife.  The Duke iGEM team had to face several major obstacles such as the beautiful weather outside, construction workers, an outbreak of slacker-itis, and the revelation that one of us is a Carolina fan.  However, the 2008 Duke iGEM team was able to overcome these challenges and is proud to present :
