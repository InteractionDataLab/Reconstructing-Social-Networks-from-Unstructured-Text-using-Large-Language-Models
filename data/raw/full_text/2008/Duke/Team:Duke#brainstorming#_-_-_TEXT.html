Spidersilk Production in Bacteria
this idea was very interesting, but has been done before. The problem that current research is hoping to overcome is spinning the material into a useful product
Hydrogen Production in Bacteria
this possibility is thoroughly being researched by several prominent scientists. Algae is confirmed to produce H2 in the absence of sulfur, but bioproduction of hydrogen is very inefficient very difficult to accomplish much in four months.
Reverse Translation
obtain the mRNA sequence from a protein structure. This is highly theoretical and little applications
Bacteria maintaining insulin homeostasis in vivo
a bacteria with the circuits that allow sensor of glucose/insulin concentrations, a circuit that induce the production of insulin, and a circuit that control the slow release of insulin into the surroundings
Bacteria dialysis
Bacteria able to supplement the kidney, or dialysis machine, in cleaning blood
Bacterial Transistor
Having voltage-sensitive ion channels within the membrane of a bacteria that when a threshold voltage is applied, the ion channels will open to allow a current to pass through. This could be taken further so that there are multiple threshold currents such that threshold voltage A elicits one response while threshold voltage B elicits another response, etc.
