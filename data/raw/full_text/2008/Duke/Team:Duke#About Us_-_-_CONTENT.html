</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Under-Undergraduates (High School-ers)</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><B>Kevin S. Chien</B>Kevin S. Chien was a singular inspiration in the lives of all whom he knew. His ever-present cheer, his quiet genius, and his genuine concern for the well-being of others all served to make his existence an indelible influence upon the memories of others. Kevin’s contagious enthusiasm and love for life were apparent in all he did—whether it was music, lacrosse (of which he was an avid fan and participant), or Frisbee, Kevin’s whole-hearted commitment provided stellar, inspiring leadership. As a bright light in the lives of all those who he loved and loved him, he will be missed but remembered by all as an upright, selfless, warm friend. He is currently well, in attendance at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, and will be attending iGEM 2008. <I>(written by Sam Wu)</I></TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Sam &quot;The Kid&quot; Wu</B> (the one being pummeled)  Sam B. Wu, 16, oft noted for usage of excessive verbiage, none of which contains any substance pertinent to subject matters at hand, currently is a second-year pupil at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.  His unconstructive and nonsensical whims, none of which are—needless to say—relevant enough to mention in this scant space, occupy much of his likewise unremarkable life. When he can be roused to pursue tasks of any perceived value however, he partakes in violin-playing, soccer, and obscure logic problems. Chief interests of his are acts of gluttony in locales of fine dining and lying awake thinking about thinking about nothing. In spite of his obvious shortcomings and young age, he enjoys making new acquaintances and hopes to make yours shortly.
</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Peter Zhu</B> Peter Zhu is a senior at North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and is one of three high school students on Duke University’s iGEM team. When he is not busy trying to get into college, he is playing tennis, breakdancing and chilling. Though he has many talents including piano, contrabass and Starcraft, he does somewhat struggle with proper &quot;Engrish&quot;. Therefore, he will keep his biography short and hopefully grammar-error-free.
