Testing AHL sender and receiver
Testing AHL receiver (T9002)
Spot 10 μl 10μM AHL on receiver-soft agar overlay and test for fluorescece.  Result:  postive response.
Spot a range of AHL concentrations (10μM, 1μM, 10nM, 1nM)for a qualitative dose-response test.  Result:  can detect down to 1μM AHL using UV lamp, but response is poor.
The above test is re-run this time using fresh, log-phase receiver cells (2 hours incubation after inoculation) and a different set of AHL concentrations (10μM, 1μM, 100nM, 10nM).  Detection much higher for 10μM and 1μM.  Observable response to 10nM although signal-to-noise ratio is poor.
Testing AHL sender (I13202)
Sender grown overnight from plate in 2*10 ml LB.  Receiver grown overnight from plate in 10 ml LB.
3 Amp plates made with receiver-SA overlay (see above).  In addition, the SA overlay of the 4th plate contains 1mM IPTG.
10 ml of sender culture used for plates 1,2 and 4.
Plate 1:  spot 10μL sender on the center of the plate.
Plate 2:  Spot 10μL sender premixed with IPTG (final concentration of 1mM).  Spot immediately after mixing.
Plate 4:  Spot 10μL sender (plate contains IPTG)
10 ml of sender culture pelleted and resuspended in LB containing 1mM IPTG.  Grow for 2 hours.
Plate 3:  Culture pelleted again and 10μL supernatant, which contains AHL, spotted onto plate.
Result
All plates, including plate 1, had high levels of fluorescence, detectable by a UV lamp.  This confirms that the lacI+pL hybrid promoter (R0011) is constitutively on at a high level ( http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_R0011 ).  However, there is no evidence for higher fluorescence in the presence of IPTG despite claims that a 600 fold increase in expression should occur.  This may be because the concentration of sender is too high.
The properties of lacI+pL, though interesting, is not of concern for our project, as we intend to use another Bacillus compatible promoter anyways.
This experiment has confirmed that the sender is definitely capable of secreting AHL, which is sufficient for this stage.
Future work:
A lower concentration of sender could be used either by dilution or lower growth times.
for better quantification, we could try a protocol similar to the one used by the NCBS 2007 team.
