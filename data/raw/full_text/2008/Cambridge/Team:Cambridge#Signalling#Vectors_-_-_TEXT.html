1.2 Insert Integration
2 Shuttle Vectors
2.1 Plasmid Gels]
Integration Vectors
These vectors integrate into the chromosome and do not have a replication origin in Bacillus. They either integrate cassettes that require double crossovers and two homologous regions, or whole-plasmid insertions that only require one crossover and one corresponding region of homology.
Ectopic Integration
The integration site of these is pre-determined
