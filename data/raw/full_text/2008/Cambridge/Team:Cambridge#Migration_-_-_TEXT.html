I'm saving the html scripts I've changed in case anyone needs them back! Templates 08 and 08a Done. Protocols page done.
Please note UK spelling! So double L for signalling and Modelling pages please! Please ammend your own links if you've got it wrong.
Noticed that the two titles by the end of the B.subtilis transformation protocol page have no content. What's that? Perhaps an answer from Ian? Dan? Marie?
