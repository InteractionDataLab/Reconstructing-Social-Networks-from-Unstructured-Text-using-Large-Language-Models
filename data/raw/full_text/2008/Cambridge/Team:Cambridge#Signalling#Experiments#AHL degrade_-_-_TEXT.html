Testing different volumes of AHL
Our previous experiments were inconclusive because we believed that we possibly swamped our Bacillus with excess amounts of AHL so that no appreciable degradation was seen. In this experiment we tested and compared different concentrations of AHL.
Fluorescence with 1 uM AHL
Without Bacillus: 2457
With Bacillus: 2497
Fluorescence with 10nM AHL
Without Bacillus: 1424
With Bacillus: 1318
Fluorescence with 1nM AHL
not enough for good readings

The graphs demonstrate fluorescence change across the plate from left to right.
