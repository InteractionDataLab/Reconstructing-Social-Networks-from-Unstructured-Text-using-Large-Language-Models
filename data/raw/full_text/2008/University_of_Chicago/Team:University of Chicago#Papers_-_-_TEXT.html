Expression
Patent: Method of producing bioadhesive protein . Making mussel proteins since 1990! ---Steve Kron
Patent: Bioadhesive precursor protein expression vectors . I swear these people just photocopied their application and mailed it out again. ---Steve Kron
Patent: Production of bioadhesive precursor protein analogs by genetically engineered organisms . New pictures this time. ---Steve Kron
Secretion
An E. coli Expression System for the Extracellular Secretion of Barley α-Amylase (pdf) . Entry into the wide-word of secretion-system manipulation.
Type III protein secretion systems in Bacterial Pathogens of Plants and Animals (pdf) . A nice review of natural type III secretion systems we can take advantage of, preferably without getting bubonic plague.
Salmonella Secretion pathway
Cloning and Transfer of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 Type III Secretion System for Studies of a Range of Gram-Negative Genera (pdf) . Wilson, et al.
Cellular microbiology of intracellular Salmonella enterica: functions of the type III secretion system (pdf) . Kuhle, et al.
A conserved amino acid sequence directing intracellular type III secretion(pdf) . Miao, et al.
Optimization of the Delivery of Heterologous Proteins by the Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium Type III Secretion System for Vaccine Development(pdf) . Chen, et al.
Delineation of Upstream Signaling Events in the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 Transcriptional Activation Pathway . Kim et al. What turns on SPI-2.
Mgfp-5
Recombinant mussel adhesive protein Mgfp-5 as cell adhesion biomaterial . Modified Mgfp-5 is better than Cell-Tak or poly-L-lysine; unmodified is about the same as Cell-Tak. It survives harsher washes on glass than BSA or Cell-Tak. ---Steve Kron
Practical recombinant hybrid mussel bioadhesive fp-151 . A recombinant fp-1/fp-5 fusion protein  works in cell bioadhesion assays. 1g/L production and soluble. ---Steve Kron
Enhancement of Mussel Adhesive Protein Production in Escherichia coli by Co-expression of Bacterial Hemoglobin . --Jata
Cell adhesion biomaterial based on mussel adhesive protein fused with RGD peptide .--Nora
Peptides, Messersmith
" Mussel-Inspired Surface Chemistry for Multifunctional Coatings ." Use of dopamine for the coating of materials. --Rob
" A reversible wet/dry adhesive inspired by mussels and geckos ." Messersmith's combination of gecko-foot "pillars" and mussel-foot adhesive. Was on the cover of nature!!
Yeast/Tyrosinase
The Golgi-localization of Yeast Emp47p Depends on Its Di-lysine Motif But Is Not Affected by the retl-1 Mutation in oL-COP . --Jata
Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast . --Jata
Protein transport from the late Golgi to the vacuole in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . --Jata
Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the protyrosinase gene, melO, from Aspergillus oryzae and expression of the gene in yeast cells . --Jata
" Tyrosine Inhibitory Peptide found in Flies. Potential "off switch" for tyrosinase activity - perhaps to terminate the continued growth of a glue-glob, or perhaps to prevent the conversion of DOPA into a quinone. Also potential for a negative feedback loop, as the peptide contains a potentially important DOPA. ." --Rob
"Direct spectrophotometric assay of monooxygenase and oxidase activities of mushroom tyrosinase in the presence of synthetic and natural substrates" --a good methods paper for tyrosinase spectroscopy. --Daniel.
Computer Modeling
" Robustness analysis and tuning of synthetic gene networks ." Modeling gene networks (Weiss). ---Nora
" Model checking genetic regulatory networks with parameter uncertainty ." Another Weiss paper. --Nora
Other
2007 Ideas . Great big honking list of references. ---Thomas Graham
" Quorum Sensing in E.Coli " Bioluminescence Activation via Q.S.  -Rob
" [1] ." Patent for stable extracellular tyrosinase which may or may not be useful --Laura
Molecular Biology Primer written by yours truly--Daniel
"Isolation, purification and characterization of b-1,3-glucan binding protein from the plasma of marine mussel Perna viridis" Assays for another binding protein that may be useful for our methods section.--Daniel
"The Hydroxylation of Phenylalanine and Tyrosine: A Comparison with Salicylate and Tryptophan." How the Fenton Reaction can hydroxylize Tyr into DOPA.--Daniel
