1 Media
1.1 LB Broth (1 L)
1.2 PYE
1.3 M13 Sweet
1.4 25X M13 concentrate
1.5 SOB Medium
1.6 SOC Medium(per 100 ml)
Media
LB Broth (1 L)
1 L dH20
10 g Bacto tryptone
5 g Bacto yeast extract
5 g NaCl
1 mL 2N NaOH
12 g agar (optional)
3 g agar + 250 mL broth per bottle
Autoclave
Note: Add 3 mL 1 M CaCl2 before phage transductions
PYE
This is a general-purpose Caulobacter medium and is typically used for plates and starter cultures from the freezer and for colonies off plates. Plates are incubated at 30C. Caulobacter colonies typically take 2-3 days to appear.
Per liter,
2g bacto-peptone
1g yeast extract
200mg magnesium sulfate heptahydrate
100mg calcium chloride dihydrate
Use deionized or distilled water; occasionally problems arise with less pure sources.
M13 Sweet
This is our production medium.
After autoclaving a liter of de-ionized water in a flask, add
40mL 25X M13 concentrate
10mL Hutner's Mineral Base Concentrate
We sometimes add a little extra calcium chloride (100mM stock to a final concentration of 1mM) to the flasks to encourage aggregates.
When the 1X M13 Sweet medium is assembled as indicated above, the final concentrations are:
0.5% glucose
0.15% glutamate
2mM phosphate
5 mM imidazole
0.04% ammonium chloride
1% Hutner's Mineral Salts
25X M13 concentrate
Component stock solutions:
125.0g glucose (or 137.5g glucose monohydrate) in a total volume of 600mL dH2O
47.7g L-glutamic acid sodium salt (MW 187.13) in a total volume of 200mL dH2O
8.5g imidazole in a total volume of 100mL dH2O
3.4g KH 2PO4 in a volume of 50mL dH2O
10g ammonium chloride in a total volume of 50mL dH2O
All component stocks should be made in separate bottles, autoclaved, and once they are cooled, combined into a single sterile bottle. If the components are mixed first and then autoclaved, the stock turns black. Store the stock at room temperature or at 4C. Don't worry if after a few weeks the 25X stock turns color from clear-yellow to yellow-brown.
SOB Medium
Used in growing bacteria for preparing chemically competent cells
Ingredients
0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
2% (w/v) tryptone
10 mM NaCl
2.5 mM KCl
20 mM MgSO4
Per liter:
5 g yeast extract
20 g tryptone
0.584 g NaCl
0.186 g KCl
2.4 g MgSO4
Note: Some formulations of SOB use 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM MgSO4 instead of 20 mM MgSO4.
SOB medium is also available dry premixed from Difco. Adjust to pH 7 prior to use. This requires approximately 25 ml of 1M NaOH per liter.
SOC Medium(per 100 ml)
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive Cache-Control: max-age=0
ote This medium should be prepared immediately before use.
Add 2 ml of filter-sterilized 20% (w/v) glucose or 1 ml of filter-sterilized 2 M glucose to 100 ml sterile SOB
