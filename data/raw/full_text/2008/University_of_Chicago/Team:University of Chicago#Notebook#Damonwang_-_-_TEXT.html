pUC8 CVX 336C/JM109 cultures: one is turbid and one is clear. Caulobacter plates are ready, will inoculate a starter culture. E. coli strain DW01 (pUC8 CVX 336C/JM109) frozen in 200uL 80% glycerol per 800uL culture (~16% glycerol final concentration), in Box A, slots 1 and 2. Caulobacter in 5mL and 50mL PYE, picked separately, incubated ~30C, 100rpm. Some medium dripped down the neck of the flask, but I flamed the area.
Saturday 2008-07-19
Couldn't get into the building to check temperature or OD600. Apparently Daniel Choi happened to run into someone leaving, and got in that way. The professor says to see Julie Caldwell about 24hr access.
Monday 2008-07-21
Julie Caldwell sent in a request to add me to the 24hr access list.
To do
check OD600 on Caulobacter cultures; if ready, freeze glycerol stocks.
Test E. coli glycerol stock DW01 (JM109/pUC8 CVX 336C) by streaking an LB-chloramphenicol plate
Pour PYE-Agar plates, 5 w/ and 5 w/o 2ug/mL chloramphenicol (CM).
Have PYE plates, need to pour LB-CM plates. In fact, just make a liter each of LB and PYE.
Need to set up for making electrocompetent cells. Sterilize
250mL flask
2L flask
3
4x250mL centrifuge bottles
2L water (MilliQ)
10% glycerol (in water? yes)
2x30mL Corex tubes
35x1.5mL Eppendorf
50mL Caulobacter culture is OD600=2.0, so overgrown. (Cecil, blanked with PYE)
New plan
Seed 50mL Caulobacter culture for electrocompetent stocks
Streak PYE plate from overgrown Caulobacter culture
Nora will make PYE
Pour LB-CM for streaking DW01 from glycerol
Tomorrow, Nora will dilute the 50mL culture and I will make electrocompetent stock. When the Caulobacter plate is ready, seed 50mL for glycerol stock
Nora's SOB media and my stuff for electrocompetent Caulobacter autoclaved (left autoclave, 15min fluid cycle (cycle 4?)---Schonbaum says with several liters of fluid, better to use the 30min fluid cycle).
All the glassware for electrocompetent Caulobacter autoclaved (right autoclave, cycle 2) and put on lower shelf under micropipetter tips.
Remind Jim and Soren that every label should have date and owner's name. Nora's media flasks just said "SOB".
Julie Caldwell sent in a request for my 24hr access.
Plated Caulobacter PYE and Caulobacter LB+CM. Oops.
Poured 6 LB+CM, now in 4C.
Should have autoclaved PYE in 250mL flask. Now just took a guess, since no sterile graduated cylinders available. Must wait for PYE to cool in cool water bath.
Caulobacter DW02 ~175rpm, 30C, PYE 50-75mL
E. coli DW01 streaked on LB-CM from glycerol.

Will come in ~11pm to dilute Caulobacter to appropriate concentration for Nora tomorrow.
16:00 Starter culure from streaked DW01 plate from glycerol at 37C, 250rpm, 5mL LB+8.75uL 2mg/mL CM
17:00 Starter culture from Crosson's DW01 plate picked to 30C, ~170rpm, 5mL PYE
The plate streaked 21 July 2008 from vastly overgrown culture has solid paths of colony---not Caulobacter because that's too fast
22:50 Our keycards still don't work, but apparently someone came out just as Nora was trying to enter.
DW02-21Jul was ~.5 OD600 at 22:00. Discarded all but 4mL---returned 2 to flask w. 9x >= 7.5mL PYE, added 400uL 80% glycerol to each of the remaining mL and froze -80C in A3 and A4

Miniprep'ed 22Jul-DW01/DWP1 Tube #1 is ~27uL 87.6ng/uL in 4C DNA #1 Tube #2 is ~27uL 117.4ng/ul in 4C DNA#2
Nanodrop:
Clean w. dH2O and Kimwipe
Open ND-1000 software and choose Nucleic Acid
Initialize with 2uL MilliQ
Blank with solvent (e.g., elution buffer for a column miniprep)
Between samples, wipe with dH2O on Kimwipe

Discarded 22Jul-DW02 since 21Jul-DW02 worked out after all.
Test-transformed DW02C with 1uL of each DNA (DWP1/Alfred) tube, incubated 2.5hours @ 30C, 200rpm, 1mL PYE, then spread 87ng-undil., 87ng-10xdil., 117ng-undil., 117ng-100xdil. at 30C, 23Jul08-22:00
Aliquot'ed from 21Jul PYE >8mL to 12mL culture tube in blue rack.
To do
Autoclave 2 MilliQ bottles
Sequence DWP1---Ask Harper
Make 10 PYE-CM and 6 PYE plates (Resolve to keep 10 of ea. on hand. Also 2L PYE)
Make 1L PYE (plus PYE for agar)
Transform G/R/C/Y-FP plasmids into E. coli, make glycerol stocks
Waiting
For NTA to make M15 Medium
For colonies on 23Jul-DW02C/DWP1-PYE-Agar to inoculate liquid culture
Friday 25 July 2008
262CFU on 87ng-10xdil., so ~301CFU/ng
To Do
Pick a starter culture into PYE-CM
Autoclave agar and pour plates (10 PYE-CM, 6 PYE)
Set up for SDS-PAGE with 8M urea
(HS kids made 1L of PYE-agar in one big flask! Aliquot into
5x200mL
4x200mL and 1x170mL in 500mL flasks and re-autoclave.)
Get nylon mesh and Buchner funnel
Email Marcia re: keys (Got kicked out of 216, computers moved to 210 with files intact, but no internet)
Figure out how to do phase contrast microscopy  with oil immersion >60x objective
5mL PYE in centrifuge RM shaker, "40cm stroke"?, 175rpm, 30C, 25Jul08-16:00 from 87ng-10xdil
Autoclaved 370mL agar and 50mL PYE, left-autoclave cycle 4
Oops. Going to add CM now.
20000ug/mL * V = 5mL * 2ug/mL so V = really small
Make 200ug/mL stock (100x dil. off 20mg/mL stock), then add
5uL
added 5uL, then 45uL more.
Spilled 4 of my PYE plates, so only 2 of them (for 6 total). Poured 8 PYE-CM plates successfully (200mL PYE agar + 20uL 20mg/mL CM)

Appendixes
Naming System
Cultures are named by starting date, species, medium, and a number. Only as many of these as will give a unique name, are used.
Strains are numbered sequentially, prefixed by DW to indicate that it's mine, all mine!
Maybe they should have a species field too. Except I'm not likely to have more than three or four strains ever.
