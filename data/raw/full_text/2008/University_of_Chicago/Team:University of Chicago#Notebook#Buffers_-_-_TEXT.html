Buffers
Enzyme Buffers
A good collection of buffers used in enzymology.
CCMB80
10 mM KOAc pH 7.0 (10 ml of a 1M stock/L)
80 mM CaCl2.2H2O (11.8 g/L)
20 mM MnCl2.4H2O (4.0 g/L)
10 mM MgCl2.6H2O (2.0 g/L)
10% glycerol (100 ml/L)
adjust pH DOWN to 6.4 with 0.1N HCl if necessary
adjusting pH up will precipitate manganese dioxide from Mn containing solutions.
sterile filter and store at 4°C
slight dark precipitate appears not to affect its function
Note: Create 1M concentration stocks to make buffer prep easier in future.
CCMB80: with aqueous stocks
10 mM KOAc pH 7.0: 10mL of 1M stock/L
80 mM CaCl2.2H2O: 80mL/L
20 mM MnCl2.4H2O: 20mL/L
10 mM MgCl2.6H2O: 10mL/L
10% glycerol: 100 ml/L
Hutner's Mineral Base Concentrate
It is not difficult, but follow directions carefully.
20g nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)
54.5g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate
6.67g calcium chloride dihydrate
18.5mg ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate
198mg iron sulfate monohydrate (or 323.7mg of the heptahydrate)
100mL Metals-44
TO BE CONTINUED
5x Ligation Adjustment Buffer
Intended to be mixed with ligation reactions to adjust buffer composition to be near the CCMB80 buffer
KOAc 40 mM (40 ml/liter of 1 M KOAc solution, pH 7.0)
CaCl2 400 mM (200 ml/l of a 2 M solution)
MnCl2 100 mM (100 ml/l of a 1 M solution)
Glycerol 46.8% (468 ml/liter)
pH adjustment with 2.3% of a 10% acetic acid solution (12.8ml/liter)
Previous protocol indicated amount of acetic acid added should be 23 ml/liter but that amount was found to be 2X too much per tests on 1.23.07 --Meaganl 15:50, 25 January 2007 (EST)
water to 1 liter
autoclave or sterile filter
Test pH adjustment by mixing 4 parts ligation buffer + 1 part 5x ligation adjustment buffer and checking pH to be 6.3 - 6.5
Reshma 10:49, 11 February 2008 (CST): Use of the ligation adjustment buffer is optional.
