Interesting Notes
1. All the girls on the team have names that end in "A".
2. The platypus has no nipples. It secretes milk through its skin.
3. Humans are superorganisms whose metabolism represents an amalgamation of microbial and human attributes.
4. Daniel M. Choi is responsible for the explosion of his own iPod headphones with a non-resonating circuit placed more than 3 feet away from the apparatus he was working on.
"It somehow seems that biologists start to go engineer when they are at their wits' end and engineers go biology they are at their  wits' end. Synthetic biology is probably neither biology nor engineering and that's good as both kind of people have to think outside their boxes."
-Dr. Markus Schmidt
