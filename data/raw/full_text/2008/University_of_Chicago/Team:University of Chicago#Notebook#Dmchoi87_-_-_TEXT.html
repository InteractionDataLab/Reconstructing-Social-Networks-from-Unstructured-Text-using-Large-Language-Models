Teh Book of Theorie
Daniel M. Choi is head of the Theory Division, which entails mathematical modeling and articulation of general findings.  He is therefore more interested in numbers, graphs, and words than with materials, equipments, and procedures, so very little practical information will be found here.  However, he hopes that whatever is in these dismal pages will be of some use to clever experimentalists.

Experiments/Protocols
An initial experimental method for Tyrosine Characterization -- Dmchoi87 22:01, 26 August 2008 (UTC)
A more complete protocol for Tyrosine-Lysate characterization -- Dmchoi87 18:14, 29 August 2008 (UTC)
Device Designs
Device_Mefp_DMC_1 --An initial gene system for Mefp-5 heavily based on Constitutive lux I + GFP by Stephanie Lo at Harvard-- Dmchoi87 21:28, 30 July 2008 (UTC)
Introductory Materials and Tutorials
This section houses various tutorials and treatises on fundamental subjects that serve as foundations to synthetic biology
Molecular Biology
Because of the interdisciplinary nature of our study, some of you may not be familiar with the basic concepts of molecular biology.  Although the Wikipedia article on molecular biology may be a good place to start, I've taken the initiative to write a Molecular Biology Primer for anyone who is interested.  It's a pdf file for ease of access.  Hope you enjoy! -- Dmchoi87 07:49, 9 July 2008 (UTC)
