Chemocompetent cells
General transformation
Transform 50 _l of cells with 1 _l of standard pUC19 plasmid (Invitrogen)
This is at 10 pg/microliter or 10-5 _g/_l
This can be made by diluting 1 _l of NEB pUC19 plasmid (1 _g/_l, NEB part number N3401S) into 100 ml of TE
Hold on ice 0.5 hours
Heat shock 60 sec at 42C
Add 250 _l SOC
Incubate at 37 C for 1 hour in 2 ml centrifuge tubes rotated
using 2ml centrifuge tubes for transformation and regrowth works well because the small volumes flow well when rotated, increasing aeration.
For our plasmids (pSB1AC3, pSPAT3) which are chloramphicol and tetracycline resistant, we find growing for 2 hours yields many more colonies
Ampicillin and kanamycin appear to do fine with 1 hour growth
Plate 20 _l on AMP plates using sterile 3.5 mm glass beads
Good cells should yield around 100 - 400 colonies
Transformation efficiency is (dilution factor=15) x colony count x 105/µgDNA
We expect that the transformation efficiency should be between 5x108 and 5x109 cfu/µgDNA
iGEM transformation (using paper spots)
Materials needed
Spots soaked in 5microliters warm TE for 20 minutes
2.0 conical bottom tubes
Ice
Competent cells
42C water bath/37C incubator
SOC--freshly made!
Petri plates with appropriate antibiotic
Transformaiton control DNA, like pGreen
Procedure
Soak the spots in 5microliters of the warmed TE for 20 minutes. This allows the maximum concentration of DNA in solution. Start thawing the competent cells on wet crushed ice
Chill lageled 2mL conical bottom tubes on wet ice. Add 2 microliters of DNA in TE into 50microliters thawed TOP10 cells in 2mL tubes. 2mL tubes allow better liquid movement durin incubation.
Make sure to do a control transformation! iGEM uses 1microliter of pUC19 plasmid DNA from invitrogen; we'll use pGreen from Dr. Schonbaum
Hold the DNA and competent cells on ice for 30 mintues.
Heat shock cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42C for 60 seconds. A water bath is important to improve heat transfer to the cells.
Incubate cell son ice for 2 minutes
Add 200microliters of SOC broth. This should have NO antibiotics.
Incubate cells at 37C for 2 hours while tubes are rotating/shaking. 2 hours growth helps in transfomation efficiency, especially for plasmids with resistance other than ampicillin.
LAbel an LB agar plate w/appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid, and resistance. Plate 250 microliters of the cell culture on the plate.
Incubate plate at 37C ofr 12-14 hours, making sure agar side is up. If incubated for too long, antibiotics, especially ampicillin to break down and untransformed cells will grow.
