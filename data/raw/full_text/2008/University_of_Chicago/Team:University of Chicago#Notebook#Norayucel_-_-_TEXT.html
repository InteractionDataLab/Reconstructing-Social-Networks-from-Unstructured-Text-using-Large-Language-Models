1. Diluted 1ng/microliter pGreen plasmid to 10pg/microliter with 100X dilution
2. 1microliter of plasmid to 50 microliters competent cells
3. Will grow up 50microliters of TOP10 untransformed as a control
4. Put on ice at 2:03
5. Took off ice at 2:34
6. Incubated for 1minute at 42C
7. Added 250microliters SOC media (prepared at 1:30)
8. Start incubated at 37C at 2:36
9. Take out at 3:40pm
10. Streaked 20microliters onto Amp. Plates
+pGreen
NO plasmid
11. Dan will come in Saturday morning to pick up the plates and count colonies.
July 21, 2008
No colonies grew on 10pg/microliter.
Try transformation again before trying to grow up new TOP10
DNA could be bad
Wrong antibiotic (double checked: ampicillin is correct)
Something went wrong with transformation--perhaps too long at 42C?
Bad cells (nooooo....)
Retry
10pg/microliter
100pg/microliter
1ng/microliter
no plasmid on LB (test if cells are completely dead)
Also try Dr. Schonbaum's stocks to compare
10pg/microliter
1ng/microliter
transformed at 4pm and put in 37C incubator. Check tomorrow morning.
July 22, 2008
Checked OD of Damon's caulobacter. OD should be around 1.1. Is actually at .006.
Will track OD during day until Damon comes in
9:45 OD:0.006
11:52: 0.017
1:50pm: 0.033
Damon and I will come in later to check on OD and dilute to appropriate OD so OD tomorrow morning is ~1.1.
TOP 10
10pg: 3 colonies.
100pg: 25 colonies
1ng: 200 colonies
Efficiency of cells is ~3x10^6. Need to redo.
NO plasmid on LB: big streaky mess. Cell mos' def' alive.
STOCKS, 10pg: 22
Stocks, 1ng: 300-400
Weird. Should be 100X more than 10pg. Perhaps bad dilution.
Efficiency going off 10pg is 3-4x10^7. Sadly Dr. Schonbaum's stocks aren't efficient enough. What to do....
July 23, 2008
Damon needs the shakers at 30C, so will have to put off redo of TOP10.
Check OD
10:00am: OD is 1.43.
10:45: OD is .14.
Dilute to .14
~700mL is 2L flask
1:45pm: OD is .39
July 24, 2008
Set 3mL starter culture at ~6pm.
July 25, 2008
Remade TOP10 competent cells--will try to make more competent
Inoculated 500mL of SOB at ~10am with 1mL each of TOP10 starter culture
Two 2L flasks with 250mL each
At 5:30 OD was .28 and .29 for each flask respectively
Final OD after following competent cell protocol was 1.04 (between 1-1.5 as required)
Put into -80C at 7:30pm.
July 28, 2008
Transformation with pGreen
10pg/microliter on LB Amp
1 ng/microliter on LB Amp
NO plasmid on LB Amp
NO plasmid on plain LB
Put into 37C incubator ~1:30pm
Plates
Running out of plates
500mL of LB and LB Amp agar
100mg/mL stock of Ampicillan
After cooling for ~45 minutes at room temp, added .5mL
Poured around 4:30 pm. Turned over at 5:30
Checked plates before I left at ~6pm. No growth (as expected). Will look again in the morning
July 29, 2008
Checked plates
10 pg/microliter plate had ~20 colonies. Competency still off by factor of 10 :(
1ng/microliter plate was a big streaky mess (too many to count)
NO plasmid on LB+Amp also big streaky mess. Possibly mislabeled plate??
NO plasmid +LB big streaky mess (as expected)
August 5, 2008
Transformations with DH5alpha
Old LB/Amp plates -plasmid: 200microliters +pGreen: 10microliters +pGreen: 50 microliters +pGreen: 250 microliters
New LB/Amp plates -plasmid: 200 microliters +pGreen: 50 microliters
LB -plasmid +pGreen
August 6, 2008
RESULTS
DH5-ALPHA (plated on 8.5.08) Old LB/Amp plates -strange film on all the old LB/Amp plates. Contamination? -plasmid: Only haze
+pGreen 10microliters: haze, with a few blips that are not green
+pGreen 50 microliters: haze, more blips, but still not green
+pGreen 250microliters: haze+non-green blips
New LB/Amp plates
-plasmid: Nothing.
+pGreen 50 microliters: nothing
LB
-plasmid: nothing
+pGreen 50 microliters: lots of cells
Transformations iGEM:
TOP10+p1010/LB: smear
TOP10+E02040/Amp: nothing
TOP10+pGreen (125microliters): ~20 colonies
TOP10+TE buffer: smear
August 7,2008
RESULTS from iGEM (8.6.08)
TOP10+p1010/LB: Lots of cells
TOP10+E02040/Amp: nothing
TOP10+pGreen (125microliters): 12 very small green colonies
TOP10+TE buffer:Lots of cells
..Results don't look so hot. Lets try the transformation again.
TEST: TOP10+colony of pGreen transformed from 7.28. Maybe Amp plates are bad?
Plates
TOP10+E2040/Amp
TOP10+CFP/Amp
TOP10/LB:
TOP10+pGreen
August 8, 2008
RESULTS from 8.7.08 transformation
TOP10+E2040/Amp: Nothing
TOP10+CFP/Amp:Nothing
TOP10/LB: Lots of cells (so cells are viable)
TOP10+pGreen: 40 colonies
August 11, 2008
Retry pGreen/DH5alpha with Schonbaum's Amp plates
Made new amp plates with 250mL agar LB +250microliters of 100mg/mL ampicillin (fresh)
August 13/14 at PCBio retreat. Whoo!
August 18
Grew up 250mL of DH5-alpha in LB
Prepped using Thomas’s protocol
Grew for three hours, stopped at OD of .301
Total volume ~800microliters
August 19, 2008
Grew up 250mL of XL21 in SOB
had trouble before getting starter culture to work, so made 4 starter cultures, one of which had multiple colonies. *Only three grew
Start shaking at 9:30, took out at 1:20. (OD of .35)
Electroporation of GFP generator with DH5alpha
pGreen (1microliter of 10pg/microliter)
E0240
Using stock cells+E0240
Had to do pGreen twice, first time time constant of 8.76. Second time was 4.82
With E0240 time constant was 8.22 (?)
Stock cells popped—junked it.
Added 1mL of SOC plated 80microliters for pGreen, 1mL for E0240 (scaled up to accommodate for extra media dilution)
August 20,2008
DH5alpha at competency of ~5x10^7 (15 colonies)
Still no iGEM plasmids. What gives?
Used fluorometer to check concentration of iGEM part from well 12A and control filter paper plasmid
**iGEM at 80 picograms/microgram, control is at 72
Add one microliter of solution of 10microliters to 50 microliters DNA
Electroporate
All time constants between 4.6 and 4.9.
August 21, 2008
XL1 BLUE ARE COMPENTENT! ~320 colonies
iGEM still doesn’t transform. What gives?!
Check caulobacter: it’s caulobacter!!! Looks all pretty and curvy.
Set up culture for miniprep of mystery plasmid (100mL LB+.1mL chloramphenicol stock of 35mg/mL)
streaked one colony of mystery plasmid on chloramphenicol plate
August 22, 2008
Overnight culture didn’t grow, however plate has a few colonies
Will keep growing mystery plasmid culture. 2 3mL of plate colonies, and another 1 3mL tube of old plate colonies.
MINIPRPEP!
Stabs arrived from E0240 and OompX
