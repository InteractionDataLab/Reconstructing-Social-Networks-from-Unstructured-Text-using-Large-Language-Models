Team:Rice University/Notebook/13 July 2008
From 2008.igem.org
Sunday, July 13th
Taylor Stevenson
Innoculated 100mL of LB with 1.0mL of O/N cultures and grew at 37*C (for all strains excluding the VCS257 containing the temperature sensitive phage.  All 5.0mL of this O/N were used to innoculate the 100mL of LB.  The Resulting culture was grown at 30*C).
All strains were grown to OD600nm of approximately 0.8 (Note: the 7524 strain never reached an appropriate optical density, however, I continued the prep with the slightly reduced titer).
Cells were made electrocompetent following the procedure outlined here .
Procedure resulted in 10x40uL stocks of each of the 5 strains.
