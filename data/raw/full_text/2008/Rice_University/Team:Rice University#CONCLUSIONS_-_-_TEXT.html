From 2008.igem.org
OUR TEAM ::: SUMMARY  ::: BACKGROUND  ::: STRATEGY  ::: CONSTRUCTS  ::: RESULTS  ::: ONGOING WORK
Ongoing work includes:
Characterization of resveratrol production using only 4CL:STS and feeding p-coumaric acid.
Construction of the full biosynthetic circuit and characterization of resveratrol production.
Redesign circuit so that an antibiotic selection using bleocin (toxic) is not required.
Possible switch to fluorescent screen (green beer?)
Adding woodchips to feed additional coumaric acid into the fermenting mix for additional resveratrol gain and improved taste.
Exploration of using our biosynthetic circuit in other industrial strains of yeast for resveratrol infused cider, wine, whiskey, bourbon, vodka, etc.
