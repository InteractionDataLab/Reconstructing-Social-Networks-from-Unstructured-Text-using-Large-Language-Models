From 2008.igem.org
David Ouyang
Ran a gel of:
GFP overnights (over long weekend) were miniprepped
PCR product of SupF
Did quikchange of GFP to create Amber Suppressed GFP.
PCR
5uL Buffer
1uL RFP (60ish ng/mL)
1uL dNTP
2.5uL QC-RFP-F
2.5uL QC-RFP-R
1uL PfuTurbo
37uL dH2O
First lane: 1kb ladder
Second lane: [ptet][RFP] plasmid, supercoiled? Should be around 6 or 7. Faint band around there.
Third lane: 100bp ladder
Fourth and Fifth lanes: +- DMSO, Colony PCR of SupF. Theoretical length (170). Should be around where the bottom band is. Second band could be artifact from genomic.
