Phage infected XL1-blue MR colonies cultured in 96 deep-well plate were spotted onto two LB plates using a 2uL plate replicator.  Both plates were incubated O/N, one at 30*C and one at 42*C (temp is high enough to denature the CI repressor, causing any lysogen to become lytic).
Result-both plates showed bacterial growth at all spots after 24h.
