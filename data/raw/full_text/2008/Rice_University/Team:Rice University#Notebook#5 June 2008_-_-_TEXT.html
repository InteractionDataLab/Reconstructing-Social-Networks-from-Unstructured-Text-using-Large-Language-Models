XL1-Blue MR cells were prepared for phage infection as specified in the phage packaging manual [1] and infected with phage at roughly a 1/10 pfu/cfu ratio.  Resulting phage/bacteria mixture was incubated @ 37*C for 20 min and then streaked onto an LB plate.  Plate was incubated @ 30*C O/N.
Result-approximately 100 possibly lysogenic colonies grew on plate.
