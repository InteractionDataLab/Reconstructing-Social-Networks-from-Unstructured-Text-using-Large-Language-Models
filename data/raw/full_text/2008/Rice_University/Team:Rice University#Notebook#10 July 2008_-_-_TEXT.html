ARFP transformations look just as red as normal RFP colonies. Picked out both red and non-red colonies yesterday. Will Colony PCR both to see how if there is the part on the white colonies. Pelleted white colonies had slight red tinge. Might be the ones we are looking for, just some read through.
Lane 1: 1kb ladder  Lanes 2 - 5: White Colonies Lane 6 - 7:Red Colonies Lane 8: Standard, RFP plasmid
Lane 2 PCR sent out for sequencing
Check out Amber PCR, see if anything is there.
