INTRODUCTION  ::: BACKGROUND  ::: STRATEGY  ::: CONSTRUCTS  ::: RESULTS  ::: CONCLUSIONS  ::: OUR TEAM
Our project for this year is BIOBEER, where we are genetically engineering the biosynthetic pathway for resveratrol production into a brewing yeast strain. Resveratrol has been shown to have a plethora of health benefits, including anti-cancer and anti-viral activity, cardio- and neuro-protective effects, modulation of diabetes, and anti-aging effects. Although research has been done previously to produce resveratrol in various organisms, no one to date has developed a yeast strain able to synthesize resveratrol in a de novo manner. We are going one step further, characterizing resveratrol production during anaerobic fermentation with the intent of creating a beer that contains all the health benefits of wine. Get ready for resveratrol in a fizzy ready-to-consume beverage!
