Monday 9 June
Selim Sheikh:
Designed 2 sets of sequencing primers (using Vector NTI Advance 10 http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/LINNEA-Online-Guides/LINNEA-Communities/Vector-NTI-Community/Sequence-analysis-and-data-management-software-for-PCs.html ) to be used in PCR of lambda DNA to amplify target regions:
Primer Set 1:
product of length 538
contains region of the molecule from 20481 to 21018
Tm = 81.7 C    TaOpt: 60.4 C    GC: 56.3
area of interest = 20833
sense primer: GAGACGAATGCCAGGTCATCTGAAA <---------------primer name: STF L
length: 25     Tm = 60.3 C     GC = 48.0
antisense primer: AAATCTGGATCATTCCCGAGCGCTG <-----------primer name: STF R
length: 25     Tm = 64.9 C     GC = 52.0
Primer Set 2:
product of length 309
contains region of the molecule from 23341 to 23649
Tm = 70.7 C   TaOpt: 51.4 C    GC: 31.7
area of interest = 23539
sense primer: ATCACATCGTCACCCATTGGATTGT <---------------primer name: ATTP L
length: 25    Tm = 60.1 C    GC = 44.0
antisense primer: CGATTTAGAAATGTATAGCGAGGCA <-----------primer name: ATTP R
length: 25    Tm = 55.9 C    GC = 40.0

XL1-Blue MR cells were prepared for phage infection as specified in packaging manual [1] and infected with phage at roughly a 1/10 pfu/cfu ratio.  Resulting phage/bacteria mixture was incubated @ 37*C for 20 min and then streaked onto an LB plate.  Plate was incubated @ 30*C O/N.
Result-approximately 100 possibly lysogenic colonies grew on plate.
