Verify function of BleoC biobrick (ptet-rbs-bleoR-stop)
Transform electro-competent XL1-Blue MRF' cells with the BleoC biobrick.
Streak transformed cells onto LB/Tet and LB/Tet/Bleo (10ug/mL and 6ug/mL respectively) alongside control cells which have not been transformed.
Incubate O/N @ 37*C
Result-Transformed cells showed >100 colonies on both plates while the control cells only grew on the LB/Tet plates.  BleoC appears to be functional.
