Selim Sheikh:
Designed set of sequencing primers (using Vector NTI Advance 10 http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/LINNEA-Online-Guides/LINNEA-Communities/Vector-NTI-Community/Sequence-analysis-and-data-management-software-for-PCs.html ) to be used in PCR of lambda DNA to amplify the region bounded by the restriction sites M.NgoMIV and AvrII:
product of length 4362
contains region of the molecule from 20040 to 24401
Tm = 78.4 C    TaOpt: 58.7 C    GC: 45.5
sense primer: GCCGGCGATGCCAGTGCATCAGCTGCTCAG <----------primer name: stfU L
length: 30     Tm = 78.2 C     GC = 66.7
antisense primer: CCTAGGCAGGTCATTGGCAACAGTG <-----------primer name: stfU R
length: 25     Tm = 62.5 C     GC = 56.0

We are currently having some difficulties extracting the DNA from the binder for this year. We have tried multiple transformations with positive controls (the + grew, the biobricks did not). Today we tried a PCR of the extracted DNA against a positive control.
S = Positive Control 1: A biobrick part we want to sequence
+ = Template was a mix of S,1, and 2, to make sure that the dye or anything else from extraction does not inhibit PCR
1 = Biobrick G2:1006. Lambda promoter + RFP. Expected length: 935
2 = Biobrick h3:1002. tetR + CFP. Expected length 940
The PCR was done with MCS primers which might explain the additional length of the product. The DNA extracted from the binder is faint compared to the + and ladder.
