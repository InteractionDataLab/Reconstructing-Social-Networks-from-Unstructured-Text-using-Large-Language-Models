Taylor Stevenson
Ran yesterday's ligation product on a 1% agarose gel with 10uL of 100bp and 1kbp standards.
100bp standard
digested BleoC and StfNotI ligation product
1kb standard
Result-The bands at 600bp and 150bp correspond to the larger and smaller molecular weight products of a BleoC digest.  The band near the 3kbp marker is difficult to identify, as it could be the Stf product alone, or ligated to either of the BleoC pieces.
Bands near 3.0kb and 600bp were excised.
