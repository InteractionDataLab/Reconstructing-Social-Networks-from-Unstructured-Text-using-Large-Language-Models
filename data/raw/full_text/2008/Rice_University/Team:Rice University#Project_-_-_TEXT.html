This year, the Synthetic BiOWLogists are focusing on BioBeer!!! The creation of BioBeer entails the incorporation of the resveratrol biosynthetic pathway into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Resveratrol production during fermentation will be quantified and compared with natural resveratrol sources.

BioBeer
Concept
Resveratrol is an unique phytoalexin produced by grapes, peanuts, and knotweed that has known and putative physiological effects. In mice, resveratrol has been linked to anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular benefits. Resveratrol has been reported to significantly extend the lifespan of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Additionally, resveratrol has been hypothesized to account for the French Paradox.
Using an engineered biosynthetic pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this project will attempt to create marmite and beer.  A proprietary hefeweizen strain was obtained from St. Arnold's [1] . This industrial strain is a putative diploid/polyploid strain that is used for fermentation of unfiltered beer.
Pathway Design
Typrosine Ammonia Ligase (Rhodobacter sphaeroides)
4-coumarate CoA-ligase (Arabidopsis thaliana)
Stilbene Synthase (Vitis vinifera)
