Phage infected VCS257 colonies cultured in 96 deep-well plate were spotted onto two LB plates using a 2uL plate replicator.  Both plates were incubated O/N, one at 30*C and one at 42*C (temp is high enough to denature the CI repressor, causing any lysogen to become lytic).
Result-both plates showed bacterial growth at all but one spot after 24h.  The one spot appears to be a lysogen.
The upper left spot on both plates is a negative control used to gauge aseptic technique.  The only colony that appears to have grown @ 30*C, but not at 42*C was the third from the right at the top.  This colony will be further screened for presence of a lysogen.

PCR amplified the side tail fiber region (stf) and excision/integration segment (attp).
Ran gel - looks good, sent out for sequencing.
