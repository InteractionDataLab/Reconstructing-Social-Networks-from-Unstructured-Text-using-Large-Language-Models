Preparations
Preparations were started at the end of the week before
Transformation of pDK48 and pTrc99alpha plamids in E. coli strain DH5α (0.5 µl plasmid-DNA + 50 µl competent cells)
Glycerol-stock of Vibrio harveyi BB120, BB886, mm30, BB178, BB125
pick pTrc99α and pDK48 colonies and then incubated in 3 ml LB at 37 overnight
V. harveyi cultured on LB plate
MiniPrep of pTrc99α and pDK48 from DH5α
Tuesday, 08/05/2008
Cloning of LuxP
LuxP colony PCR
LuxQ, LuxS PCR
PCR of LuxP from V. harveyi colony with the primers LuxPc and LuxPd with Taq polymerase Mastermix. 5min @ 95°C || 30s @ 95°C | 30s @ 58 °C | 2min @ 72°C || 10min @ 72°C | 4°C hold (30 cycles)
Gel Purification of LuxP eluted in 30 µl H2O
Digestion of LuxP with SalI and NotI of pDK48 and LuxP-Gel-Purification product: 2 µl NEB-Buffer 3 + 0.5 µl SalI & NotI + 10 µl DNA + 6 µl H2O
Ligation with vector:insert ratio 2µl:6µl  and 5µl:5µl
Cloning of LuxS
PCR of V. harveyi genome with primers LuxSa and LuxSb and PCR purification 5min @ 95 °C || 30s @ 95°C | 30s @ 58 °C | 2min @ 72°C || 10min @ 72°C | 4°C hold (30 cycles) with Tag polymerase Mastermix
digestion of LuxS and pTrc99α with BamHI/NcoI (NEBuffer 3 + BSA)
Ligation with vector:insert ratio 2µl:6µl and 5µl:5µl
Wednesday, 08/06/2008
5 colonies of LuxQ,S,P transformation (1:1 ligation) picked and analyes with colony-PCR
Colony-PCR to check for insert. 5min @ 95°C || 30s @ 95°C | 30s @ 58 °C | 2min @ 72°C || 10min @ 72°C  | 4°C hold (30 cycles)
Colony PCR of LuxQ, LuxS and LuxP
preparation of O/N cultures for Miniprep
Thursday, 08/07/2008
Miniprep of samples Q#1-5, S#1-5, P#1-5
PCR from Minipreps to confirm inserts. Same programme as yesterday
PCR to confirm insert from Minipreps. LuxQ no. 3 seems to be posivite. For LuxS and LuxP all samples are positive.
10 new colonies of LuxQ-plate were picked and checked via colony-PCR
LuxQ colony PCR of 10 new colonies.
Sequencing of LuxS,P,Q positive clones at GATC
Sequencing Results LuxS: correct sequence LuxP: all clones contain mutations, cloning has to be repeated LuxQ: no insert in the picked colonies
Friday, 08/08/2008
Miniprep of overnight-cultures of the picked colonies Q#6-15
In silico cloning of LuxQ, S in pTrc99α and LuxP in pDK48
Test-Digestion of LuxQ with XbaI --> positive result for Q3, 7, 9, 11, 14
