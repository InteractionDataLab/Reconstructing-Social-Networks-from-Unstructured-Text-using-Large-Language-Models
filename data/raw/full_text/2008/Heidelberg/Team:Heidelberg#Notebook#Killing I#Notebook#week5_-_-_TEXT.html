conjugation test
conjugation test did not work at all - no colonies
Phage cloning strategy one
we got colonies on the control plate (pBAD33 on Amp and Cm)! so we have to test pBAD33 again on Amp and Cm. If pBAD33 is amp resistant, all conjugative tests done so far would be useless.

miniprep of oriT in pBluescript
digestion of OriT in pBluescript, digestion with BglI to check the plasmid

lane 0: DNA ladder mix
lane 1-6: ligation of 4 parts (GFP::CmR) in pBluescript (not yet transformed)
lane1-3: ligation at 4°C for 16h
lane4-6: ligation at 14°C for 16h
lane 7: old pBluescript undigested (2960bp)
conclusions
the pBluescript::OriT is probably wrong
the old Maxiprep of pBluescript is probably wrong
but OriT might also be wrong
we can't be sure if our ligations just didn't work because a part was wrong and should check the fragments we are working with
New proceeding:
just to check
transformation of oriT in pBluescript together with pUB307 (helper plasmid)
transformation of ligation of 4 parts in pBluescript
but at the same time:
next week inoculation of liquid culture of new donor bacteria --> glycerol stocks --> conjugation tests
New digestions of the new pBluescript Maxis
with XbaI-XhoI
with XbaI-AgeI
