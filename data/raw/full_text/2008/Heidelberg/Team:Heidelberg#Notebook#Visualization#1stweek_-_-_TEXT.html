Preparation of TB media with an Agar concentration of 0.4 %, 0.2 % and 0.1 %.
First microscope test using MG1655 in 6 small chambers from Labtek:
3 types each type twice:
I - 0.1% agar in LB
II - 0.25% agar in LB
III - 0.5% agar in LB
View:
I II III
I II III
In I and II each chamber was filled with just 100 µl LB agar to cover the whole ground.
Because the III. solution was more viscous 150 µl were necessary to cover the ground.
The bacteria were put into one corner of a chamber. (2 µl of a MG1655 overnight culture) They have been set under the media or in between.
About that another 100 µl of a LB solution with 2 % agar were poured. After the second layer has solidified further 250 µl LB-media were added.
The chambers were incubated overnight at 37 °C. For microscope on the next day.
Notes: Because of surface tensions the solutions tend to be thicker at the borders of the chamber than in the center.
-> In the further future 150 - 200 µl will be used.
