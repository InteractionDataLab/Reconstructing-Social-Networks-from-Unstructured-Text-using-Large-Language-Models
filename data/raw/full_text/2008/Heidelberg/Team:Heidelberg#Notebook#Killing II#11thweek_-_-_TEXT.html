Construction of reporterplasmid with kanamycin resistance
mCherry
Transformationresults: Cultures were grown, also on plates with wrong plasmid - insert ratio
Inoculation of liquid cultures from transformation with wrong ratio in the morning.
Miniprep of liquid cultures in the evening: eluted in 35 µl H2O, (Qiagen Miniprepkit)
Inoculation of liquid cultures from transformation with right ratio.
pSB1A2-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Mutagenesis of pSB1A2-ColicinE1-Receiver
MiniPreps of colE1 after the 2nd mutagenesis (colonies 1.14, 1.16, 5.1, 5.7) and of colE9 (colonies 2 and 4, still with the pre-/suffix) each on pSB1A2 after receiver --> sent for sequencing
Colonies picked from the transformations of the mutated colE9 parts (with the correct pre-/suffix) --> inocculated and MiniPreped (for digestion and sequencing)
Characterization: ColicinE1-Receiver Activitytest
4 pm: Inoculation of:
30 ml TB-Kana with BBa_I20260
30 ml TB-Amp with T9002-Receiver without GFP
30 ml TB-Amp with pSB1A2-ColicinE1-Receiver
8.30 pm: Preparing mixtures for the plate:
plate scheme:
Killer:Prey 1:0.25 -> 200 µl Referencepromotercells + 800 µl Receivercells
Killer:Prey 1:1    -> 200 µl Referencepromotercells + 200 µl Receivercells + 600 µl TB media
Killer:Prey 1:5    -> 200 µl Referencepromotercells +  40 µl Receivercells + 760 µl TB media
Killer:Prey 1:10   -> 200 µl Referencepromotercells +  20 µl Receivercells + 780 µl TB media
9.30 pm: Starting measurement
Sender cloning: constitutive promotor-sender
Characterization: Sender Activity Test
Characterization: Sender-Test measured every hour over the day. See Saturdayurday for more details.

In most cases the later supernatants have a higher GFP/OD rate: But there in some cases earlier concentrations are much higher. A problem was that the plate stand at 4 °C for 2 days so this could cause these outliers. In the next days we repeat this experiment to characterize these parts properly.
