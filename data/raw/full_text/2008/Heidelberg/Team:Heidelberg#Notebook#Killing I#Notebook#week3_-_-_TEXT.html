lamda phage
Infectiontest
inoculation of 20ml medium with over night culture (MG1655)
after 1h plaque added --> 37C for 2h + inoculation of ZMBH phage (100ql 10^-2 in 20ml MG1655)
incubation at 42C for 2 more hours
sterilefiltration + mix with growing bacteria (MG1655 and MG1655+cI)
incubate in soft agar at 37C for 2h, than at 42C for another 4h (altogether 24 plates)
phage DNA was also isolated from filtrate
results:
same amount of plaques on plates with MG1655 as with MG1655+cI
nearly no plaques on plates with own phage --> very low phage concentration
--> cI does not work!!!!
growing curve
the values are the average of all four cultures

lambda phage

very nice separation of the small fragment from the two large fragments (one band) picture of the gel was not saved but it looked very nice
cutting out of the small and large fragment --> gel purification kit

large fragment1: 19,5 ng/µl; 2,11
large fragment2: 61,5ng/µl; 1,90

no success
project planning
Guys, we received this email by another professor in the states. sounds good. we should get this helper plasmids in the end :)
I have sent pUB307, RSF1010, pED350, pED361, which are described in our two MGG papers. Also two clones I made of the oriT from RP1; pED369 and pED374. There are 10microl of each.  The DNAs are old (1983!) and so I would transform and make fresh plasmid preps.
pED350 is oriT+ and Mob+, so it is efficiently mobilised by RPI or its derivative pUB307. pED361 is oriT+ only.  It cannot be mobilised by pUB307 as it lacks mob functions.  If RSF1010 is also in the cell pKD361 is very efficiently mobilised by pUB307.
pED369 and pED374 are two subclones I made of the RP1 oriT into pED825 (Amp resistant described in MGG papers).  pED374 contains a single 690 bp HaeII fragment containing the RP1 oriT. PED369 contains the 690 bp oriT fragment plus additional HaeII fragments.  I sent both just in case the pED374 DNA does not check out.  These are efficiently mobilised by pUB307.
I would think cloning this 690 bp fragment into your lambda vector would be the simplest solution; its small and will mobilise in the presence of just pUB307.

GFP
Miniprep of reference promotor I20260
Concentrations:
Epi1 9,8 ng/ul; 2,52
Epi2 15,7 ng/ul; 2,28
Epi3 19,7 ng/ul; 1,93
Digestion of I20260
10 µl DNA (from Epi3) 2ul SmlI 12µl NEB4 2ul BSA 10x 4 µl water
Digestion of the XbaI-XhoI fragment with AgeI
18 µl DNA (from gel purification kit) 5 µl AgeI 5 µl NEB4 22 µl water
Gel
Lane 0: DNA ladder mix
Lane 1: I20260 (SmlI-->251bp, 373bp, 843bp, 918bp, 1284bp)
Lane 2: XbaI-XhoI fragment (AgeI-->1.7kb, 7.3kb)
Lane 3: large lambda DNA fragments 3µl (15kb, 24.5kb)
Results:
I20260 seems not to be correct, inoculate overnight cultures from the glycerol stocks again
digestion of the XbaI-XhoI fragment with AgeI did not work good, only the 7.3kb fragment can be seen, reasons: wrong buffer concentration, too much enzyme (glycerol) in the reaction
large lambda DNA fragment is looking good
