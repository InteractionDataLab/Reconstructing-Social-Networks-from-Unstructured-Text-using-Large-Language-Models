Killing I - Cloning strategy
Our goal to clone a modified bacteriophage λ which can be transported by conjugation, allows the selection of infected cells through a chloamphenicol resistance and harbours GFP for visualization was designed in two strategies whereas strategy two builds on strategy one. A detailed description of the two strategies can be seen below (see 1.1 and 1.2). The used λ cI protein generator was synthesised by geneart and just transferred in a standard plasmid as it can be seen in 1.3.
