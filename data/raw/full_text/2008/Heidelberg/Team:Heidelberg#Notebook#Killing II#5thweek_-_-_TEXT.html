Miniprep of pBAD-F1610,9: 179,6 ng/ul; Qiagen Miniprepkit
Inoculation of liquid cultures from Transformation of double-transformation.
Activity Test
Results of Colicintest: You can see that stressed Colicin E1 cells are able to kill TOP 10. But this could also be caused by Mytomycin C.
Growthcurve:
Inoculation of TOP10s with 1ml/2ml supernatant of:
MG1655
ColicinE1 unstressed
ColicinE1 stressed
ColicinE9 unstressed
ColicinE9 stressed
OD was measured hourly in tecan plate reader
New inoculation of same cultures in LB media.

Minipreps of the ligation ONCsvfrom 02.09.:
concentrations:   R1: 152,3 ng/ul   R2: 150,4 ng/ul   R3: 76,7 ng/ul   R4: 132,8 ng/ul   R5: 142,1 ng/ul    R6: 138,4 ng/ul   R7: 136,8 ng/ul   R8: 187,7 ng/ul
Controldigestions of ligation with XbaI and SpeI

Gel of digestion:
Gelresults: Expected fragments 2150 bp and 1088 bp. The 2150 bp fragments are there but there is a 1500 bp fragment instead of the 1088 bp fragment. Despite this we made some new glycerolstocks.
Activity Test
Results of growth curve test from yesterday: The results were very diffusing so that we perform this test again.
New hourly growth curve measurement (see Tuesdaysday for details). No significant effect of colicins can be seen. Only Mytomycin C kills the TOP 10 cells very effectively

Colicin Receiver
pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin-Cloning
Despite of the strange digestion pattern we try the next step of the cloning.
PCR of colicins:
25.0 µl Phusion MasterMix  2.5 µl colE1prot/colE9prot_fw_BamHI  2.5 µl colE1prot/colE9prot_rv_SpeI 18.0 µl H2O  2.0 µl DNA templates ------- 50.0 µl
program: 98 °C  30 sec 98 °C  10 sec 59 °C  20 sec 72 °C  45 sec 72 °C   8 min  4 °C  constant
PCR purification and analytic gel: Expected fragments are there
Digestion of purified PCR products with BamHI and SpeI: 1h -> 37 °C
Vector:  6.0 µl DNA  2.0 µl NEBuffer 2  2.0 µl SpeI  2.0 µl BamHI  2.0 µl BSA10x  6.0 µl H2O ------- 20.0 µl

Gel & Gelextraction: The expected bands were visible. After cutting we purified them using the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit.
Sequencing: Send R1 (LuxR-Receiver) to GATC.
Inoculation of 4 receiver colonies
Activity Test
New plans for characterization:
Cloning of Colicin proteins into pQE-30 vector for His-Tag purification of colicins. Therefore we designed reverse primers with HindIII (ColE1) and XmaI(ColE9) sites.
