Guys, I sent an email to Prof. Bagdasarian asking about the RP4 resistance  and also if he can send us directly the plasmid and not the strain. Meanwhile, I found this paper:
Distribution of Restriction Enzyme Recognition Sequences on Broad Host Range Plasmid RP4: Molecular and Evolutionary Implications
Brian M. Wilkinsa, f1, Paul M. Chilleya, Angela T. Thomasa and Michael J. Pocklingtona a Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, England
Please, tomorrow morning check this paper, it should contain the sequence of the RP4 plasmid. In this case, we should be able to find out which resistance is there (if any....).
Good night, Barbara
Strategy for progress:
we ordered SanDI (restriction enzyme), GeneRuler 1kb Ladder plus, GeneRuler DNA Ladder High range and a gel extraction kit (QIAEX II) for extraction of large fragments
our plan is to doubledigest lambda DNA with XhoI/XbaI, clone this fragment into a vector and amplify it in E.coli. This fragment is than extracted again and digested with SanDI to get an fragment with XhoI and SanDI ends. This fragment includes the necessary GAM site. This fragment is than ligated with our inclusion cassette which has SanDI and XbaI ends (generation described below). This big fragment (ends XhoI and XbaI with oriT and AB cassette) is than ligated in the lambda fragment lacking its XhoI/XbaI fragment. The now complete new lambda phage is than transferred into the killer strain by transformation or in vitro packaging.
design of our insert: our insert includes the oriT, the AB cassette (probably Chloramphenicol) and a terminator. All these fragments are separetly amplified by PCR while cloning specific sticky ends to the fragments (oriT: SanDI/BamHI; AB: BamHI/NcoI; terminator: NcoI/XbaI). Our insert finally consists of the oriT, the AB cassette and the terminator. This big fragment has a SanDI and a XbaI end, necessary for the later ligation with the lambda fragment (XhoI/SanDI).

Prof. Bagdasarian replied to my email:
Dear Barbara: RP4 carries resistances to Ap, Km and Tc.  It was easier to send you a strain containing the plasmid since we do not have purified DNA of the plasmid at this time. Please note that the description of the strain we have sent you only indicates Ap. I don't know the reason for that. It would, therefore, be good to check the resistances when you receive the strain.
Michael
So, when we receive the strain we will check the resistances as suggested.

test digestion of plasmids
P1004 (A,B,C,D,1 and 2) and P1000 with DraI (0,15ul enzyme, 2ul NEB-buffer 4, 10ul DNA per 20ul sample)
B0014 (1 and 2) and B0015 with SfcI (0,3ul enzyme, 2ul NEB-buffer 4, 10ul DNA per 20ul sample)
inoculate for 2h at 37°C
expected fragments
B0014 and B0015: 1710,824,464,191
P1004
P1000
agarose gel of digestion above with very bad results: DNA concentration too low
therefore a retransformation done with
P1004-D, P1004-1, P1000, B0015, B0014-1 and B0014-2
cI
inoculation of cultures for maxiprep:
cI-retransformation from yesterday: 2 samples in 250ml LB + Amp

cI
Maxiprep CI
Concentration Measurement of obtained DNA with Nanodrop
Result: two epis with each 100ul DNA (1ug/ul);
Restriction digest of obtained CI DNA with SfcI and HindIII (NEB Buffer 4)
Result: High probability that the plasmid is CI, but the image we got is not enough to prove it.

New cloning strategy
due to the missing of SanDI (not available), our cloning strategy has to be changed
digest lambda DNA with XbaI and XhoI
digest the small fragment (~9kb) with AgeI
discard the fragment with INT/XIS (~7,3kb), the other fragment contains the necessary GEM (~1,7kb)
ligate: chloramphenicol cassette, GFP, oriT and the GEM-fragment
(chloramphenicol cassette amplified by PCR)
we have to check if there are AgeI restriction sites in the DNA fragments to be cloned
no AgeI restriction sites could be found --> good
results: there is no restriction site of AgeI, XhoI or XbaI in the oriT, GFP and the chloramphenicol sequence

chloramphenicol resistance cassette
analytical Digestions of
P1000-1, B0014-1, B0015 1 and 2 both grown on K and on A, P1004 1 and 2,
preparative digestion of P1000-1
results: there was only the undigested vector on the gel - plan to cut the chloramphenicol casette out and to ligate it into another vector abandonded for the moment
where lies the problem? Is the right plasmid in the registry, the wrong sequence in the database or did the enzyme fail to work?
Sequencing of Miniprep DNA B0015 A1, B0014 1, P1000 1, cI
Saturday, 08/16/08
Retransformation of P1000, P1004, B0014, P1000, cI
evaluation of sequencing data
cI has not the correct sequence
P1000 has not the correct sequence
B0014 has not the correct sequence
B0015 has the right sequence!
