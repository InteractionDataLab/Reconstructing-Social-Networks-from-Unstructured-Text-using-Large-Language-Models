pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Digestion of pSB1A3 with XbaI and SpeI from cloning cultures of last week. We used these cultures because the bande where easier to distinguish. !!!
2008-09-18 UPDATE: the different bands were probably from the religated pSB1A3 plasmid, which cannot be cutted with XbaI and SpeI. -> No cutted pSB1A3 backbone

Colicin activity test
9 am: One E9 - M9 culture, one E1 - M9 culture and one E1 - LB culture were stressed with 10 µl of 0.1 mg/ml Mytomycin C
4 pm: The colicin E1 LB cultures were thrown away, because the grew well in M9. The MG1655 and colicin cultures were sonicated in a ultrasonic bath three time for 15 seconds. After sonication cell extract was observed under microscope -> lot of dead cells -> succesfull lysis.
Overnight-Activity-Assay:
lysed cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 400 rpm. The supernatants were transferd to new falcons and were used for a colicin activity test.
well plate scheme:
3:1 -> 3 ml M9 media + 1 ml supernatant + 200 µl reference promotor cells (I20260) 1:1 -> 2 ml M9 media + 2 ml supernatant + 200 µl reference promotor cells (I20260) 1:3 -> 1 ml M9 media + 3 ml supernatant + 200 µl reference promotor cells (I20260)
ON-measurement for 14 h at 37 °C in Tecan well plate reader

pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Transformation results: we picked and plated 8 colonies of each transformation on LB-Ampicilin plates and in addition we inocculated liquid cultures.
HisTag cloning of Colicins for purification
Transformation results: We plated our transformation on LB-Kanamycin because BL21 cells contain a helper plasmid which has an Kanamycin resistance. But pQE-30 plasmids have an Ampicilin resistance. Because of that we transderd colonies from an bacteria lawn to Ampicilin/Kanamycin plates.
