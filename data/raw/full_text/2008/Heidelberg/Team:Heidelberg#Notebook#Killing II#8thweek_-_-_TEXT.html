pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Digestion of pSB1A3-Receiver Minipreps for identification of positive clones. In addition we want to continue the colicin cloning with the cutted fragment: colonies 31, 35, 36, 39, 40, 42, 45, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73; 1h -> 37 °C
25 µl DNA  2 µl SpeI (NEB)  5 µl NEBuffer 2 (NEB)  5 µl BSA 10x (NEB) 13 µl H2O ----- 50 µl
Gel of pSB1A3-Receiver Minipreps digestion: 0.7% Agarose, 135 V, 30 min
Gel result:
Expected bands: pSB1A3-Receiver without GFP ~3200 bp
There were bands at slightly different heights. We were not able to determine which of these bands have the right size. So we extracted 31, 35, 36, 39, 40, 45, 66, 69, 71, 72 and 73. To identify the right fragments we started a double digest with XbaI and SpeI. Plasmid 42 look like it was not cutted. So we expected that the fragment is ligated reverse into it.
Gelextraction: Qiagen Kit, eluted in 40 µl H2O
Digestion of pSB1A3-Receiver Minipreps for identification of positive clones: colonies 31, 35, 36, 39, 40, 42, 45, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73; 55 min -> 37 °C
12 µl DNA  2 µl SpeI (NEB)  2 µl XbaI (NEB)  5 µl BSA 10x (NEB)  5 µl NEBuffer 2 (NEB) 24 µl H2O ----- 50 µl
Gel of pSB1A3-Receiver Minipreps digestion: 0.7% Agarose, 135 V, 30 min
Gel results:
Expected bands:
positive clones: backbone ~2100 bp and insert ~1100 bp, partial digested ~3200
religated clones: backbone ~2100 bp
reverse inserted clones: no digestion
clones with T9002 (with GFP): backbone ~2100 bp and insert (T9002) ~1950 bp
42: reverse inserted. To verify these assumption we send plasmid 42 to GATC for sequencing
31, 39, 40, 45, 69: One thick band at ~2000 bp. In the digestion with SpeI only, these plasmids had the higher bands (~3500 - 4500 bp). Because of these facts we assume that these clones contains T9002 with GFP. To verify this assumption we send plasmid 31 to GATC for sequencing.
35, 36, 66, 71, 72, 73: One band at ~3000. Result looks like the digestion with SpeI only. Maybe these are positive clones and we have lost the XbaI restriction site during the cloning. To verify this assumption we send plasmid 35 to GATC for sequencing.

Controldigestion of colonies 31 & 35 and BBa_T9002 with BamHI and XbaI and SpeI: 1 h 15 min -> 37 °C
Gel of Controldigestion: 1% Agarose, 30 min, 135 V
Gelresults:
Colony 31: BamHI, XbaI/SpeI and undigested bands have same pattern as BBa_T9002. Maybe this is the luxpR-receiver with GFP.
Colony 35: BamHI digestion succesful but Xba and SpeI show only one fragment like it is cutted only once.

Gel of digestion: 1% Agarose, 30 min, 135 V
Gelresults: Sequencing results have shown that XbaI site is methylated at the GATC pattern. Because of that XbaI is not able to cut. To solve these problem we order new primers with the right prefix.

BioBrick sender part
To create a sender part which fits BioBrick standards we want to combine BBa_F1610 with an constitutive promoter (BBa_J23107) and in addition wit a pBAD inducible promoter (BBa_I0500). Therefore we cut the promoter parts with SpeI and PstI and the sender gene cassette with XbaI and PstI. The sender gene cassette will be ligated with the cutted promoter parts.
