project planning
we finally received the strains sent to us by Prof. Bagdasarian. Beginning of next week we should also receive those from Prof. Derbyshire.
this means we have to do mini(or maxi)-preps to get the plasmids from which we can amplify the oriT and the helper plasmids (RP1/4, pUB307 if we need this).
We received the strains from Prof. Derbyshire. He sent us pUB307, RSF1010, pED350, pED361, pED369 and pED374.
we received two plates with bacteria containing pUB307. We picked 4 colonies and inoculated them in   with canamycin.
we received the glycerol stocks of the cI from the registry and inoculated these for a maxiprep in LB with ampicilin.
Phage cloning strategy one
Digestion of the small XbaI-XhoI lambda-fragment with AgeI
18µl DNA (from gel purification kit) 5µl AgeI 5µl NEB4 4µl water
the digestion of the small lambda fragment showed no DNA on the gel...
we amplified GAM, GFP, Chloramphenicol and the OriT from Prof. Bagdasarian via PCR:
2µl  Forward Primer 2µl  Reverse Primer 25µl  Phusion Mastermix 10ng DNA Template fill up to 50µl with water
PCR protocol 98°C 1min 98°C 30s  | 55°C 30s  | 25x 72°C 90s  | 72°C 5min
Results of PCR:
lane2: GAM fragment (~1.44kb)
lane3: GFP fragment (~0.92kb)
lane4: oriT fragment (~0.52kb)
lane5: CmR fragment (~0.66kb)
lane6: DNA ladder mix
NOTE: we have to find suitable names for all our OriT-Sequences and Helper Plasmids from the different research groups!!!
Retransformation of the plasmids received from Prof. Derbyshire (he recommended to do this, because the DNA is very old)
pUB307 - Canamycin resistance
pED369 - Ampicilin resistance
pED350 - Amp
pEd361 - Amp
pED374 - Amp
We need streptomycin or sulphonamides to select the RSF1010...

cI sent to GATC for sequenzing
digestion of lambda-DNA with XhoI-XbaI following the old protocol
if AgeI still doesn't work, we're going to have to check if we got the restriction site right and/or test the enzyme with another plasmid
Gel

lane3: digestion of lambda-DNA with XhoI-XbaI
lane 4 - 8: assays of Yin
the gel was somehow damaged when we took out of the gel chamber. it was impossible to go on working from it

the sequence of the cI we received from MIT was wrong and corresponded to GFP instead. We will do another prep this evening so that we can send the "cI" to GATC again tomorrow.

cI
cI sent to GATC again)
Phage cloning strategy one
Lambda DNA purification (follow kit, like Tue)
run the DNA in 1% gel: no signal
no DNA? to low concentration? lost the DNA by the purification?
In vitro Packaging
follow kit, pack Lambda cI 857
titering with DH5alpha, MG1655
DH5alpha: very nice infection, a lot of plaques. titer:10^7puf/ml
MG1655: the infectionrate is lower than with DH5alpha, but also many plaques. Titer: 4*10^6pmf/ml
