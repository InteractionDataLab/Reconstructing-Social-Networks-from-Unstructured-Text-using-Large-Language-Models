He will also provide R&amp;D facilities and a team budget. Professor Eils is head of the Departments of Theoretical Bioinformatics in the institutes Bioquant, IPMB, and DKFZ. Moreover, he is founding director of Bioquant and directs the German-wide Systems Biology in Cancer initiative of the Helmholtz foundation with a volume of 50 Mio. Euro. Together with Professor Wolfrum he directs the Viroquant initiative on modeling and simulation of virus entry. He has won numerous awards in the field of image analysis; in particular he has been awarded the Biofuture price by the BMBF for innovations allowing the graphical reconstruction of the eukaryotic mitosis process from 4D microscopy images. In 2004, he was one of the organizers of the International Conference on Systems Biology, which was hosted by him here in Heidelberg. His publication with Martin Bentele, Inna Lavrik and Professor Krammer on the computational determination of the CD95 threshold in The Journal of Cell Biology in 2004 gave birth to the current Applied Systems Biology group, which is now largely involved in the research of cancer signaling. In 2004, Professor Eils, Ivayla Vacheva, and Professor Bock have won the Microsoft Research Award for the development of Optimal Experiment Design tools. His new engagement in the up-coming field of synthetic biology underlines the need for tight interdisciplinary work between experimentalists and theoreticians. <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Team#Team_Heidelberg-_Members" title="Team:Heidelberg/Team">back</A><P>E-Mail: r.eils at dkfz.de

He has done his PhD at the Institute of Physics and Technology in Moskow and in the lab of Professor R. Schmitt at University of Regensberg. He then went as post-doctoral scientist for five years to Professor H. Berg at Harvard University in Cambridge, USA, and became group leader in 2003 at the Center for Molecular Biology in Heidelberg. Victor investigates bacterial chemotaxis as example for the molecular perception of environmental signals and their transduction within cells. He combines quantitative data with computational modeling to obtain a detailed understanding of the signaling mechanisms in complex systems. In his Nature publication in 2005 he could use criteria for systems robustness in order to predict a correct topology for the Che signal transduction network. This approach has become a paradigm for the utilization of systems biology to pursue biological research. For his successful research on prokaryotic signal transduction Victor has won the Chica and Heinz Schaller award in 2007.

He has studied Molecular Biotechnology at University of Heidelberg with a focus on Systems Biology. As part of his studies he visited in 2005/06 for seven months the Systems Biology Group of Professor Palsson at UCSD in California, where he tested novel FBA methods to predict the metabolic state of bacteria. For his Master thesis he has worked in the Applied Systems Biology group of Professor Eils on a negative feedback loop to analyze the dynamics of transient states in prokaryotic gene expression.

Due to his firm background in systems theory he is an enthusiastic fan of synthetic biology and iGEM; it is for his persevering encouragements that an iGEM team for Heidelberg could be initiated. Hauke has done his Ph. D. in non-linear dynamics at the Technical University of Darmstadt. At the DKFZ in Heidelberg he has been involved in the start-up of today's Applied Systems Biology group. He currently works on several interdisciplinary projects at Bioquant and DKFZ. His findings on the orchestration of multiple signaling pathways controlling keratinocyte migration have recently been accepted by Molecular Systems Biology. Inspired by his background in stochastic modeling he furthermore investigates transient gene expression states that are affected by random reaction kinetics due to low particle numbers, in particular in prokaryotes. He is also involved in the development of optimal experiment design tools for the parameter estimation in large ODE systems. With Jens and Victor he will coordinate and support the team during the summer.

Her Ph.D. project consisted in constructing a synthetic human p53 network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The absence in yeast of the vast majority of p53 regulators allowed investigating its functional, post-translational modifications by Mdm2. She found that Mdm2 is necessary in yeast to recruit p53 to nuclear bodies reminiscent of human PML bodies, suggesting a possible involvement of Mdm2 in the recruitment of p53 to PML bodies in human cells. This reductionist yeast model paves the way to dissecting the p53 network to understand the core mechanisms of its regulation. On the theoretical side Barbara has worked on modeling biochemical networks in a spatial stochastic framework. She believes in the power of synthetic biology to teach important lessons about real biological systems as well as in the winning combination of theory and experiments to understand the molecular mechanisms driving biological processes. Barbara is very excited at the idea of mentoring the young, motivated and enthusiastic students of the Heidelberg iGEM 2008 team! <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Team#Team_Heidelberg-_Members" title="Team:Heidelberg/Team">back</A><P>E-Mail: b.diventura at zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de

<P>Michaela did her PhD on the structure and dynamics of the interchromosomal domain compartment in eukaryotic cells in the department for Cell Biology at the German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ in Heidelberg. Following her PhD she worked as a Postdoc in the lab of Prof. Dr. Harald Herrmann on nuclear intermediate filament proteins called lamins. She investigated the influence of disease-related mutations in A- and B-type lamins on nuclear morphology. In 2005 she joined the group of Prof. Roland Eils. The main focus of her work is now on DNA double strand break repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). She is investigating protein-protein interactions in living cells by using FRAP technology and kinetic modeling. The longterm goal of her project is to understand mechanisms of pathway choice between NHEJ and HR. She likes to support the students team with all her expertise in current molecular and cell biological as well as imaging techniques.

Afterwards he will continue with his master studies in Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg. During his bachelor studies he has done an internship at the group of Professor Eils in the BioQuant Heidelberg, in which he worked on the simulation ofÂ ??Ku protein diffusion in eucaryotes. This internship led to the decision that he will concentrate on bioinformatics and especially on systems biology in his master studies, because he is interested in the combination of theoretical simulations of cellular processes and laboratory work. <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Team#Team_Heidelberg-_Members" title="Team:Heidelberg/Team">back</A><P>E-Mail: kuehne.andreas at googlemail.com

She spend the last 5 month in Montpellier, France, where she completed an internship working on a project with the aim to identify the role of the protein SFRP (Secreted frizzled related protein) and to characterize its expression in the muscle homeostasis in the nematode C. elegans.
<P>Kathrin is fascinated by the possibilities synthetic biology offers, especially in simplifying the work of scientist by an exchange of standardized biological parts and devices. 
She is looking forward to participate in the development and organization of the project this summer working with an interdisciplinary team.
