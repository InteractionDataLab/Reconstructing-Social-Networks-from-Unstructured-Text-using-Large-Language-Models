Chemotaxis - Killing Model
Our detailed documentation "Spatially Resolved Modeling of Colicin-Induced Killing and Chemotactic Sensing in Escherichia Coli." includes the following information:
Introduction into the biological sytem
Chemotaxis model
Parameter estimation
Numerical methods
Results
Conclusions
You can download the documentation on Spatially Resolved Modeling of Colicin-Induced Killing and Chemotactic Sensing in Escherichia Coli . Further we have made a summary of the complete modeling group for non-mathematicians.
Simulation movies
Below is a list of simulation movies. Specific parameters can be taken from our documentation. All simulations are in ogg vorbis format (see http://www.vorbis.com for help).
movie 1 ( 3D , 2D )
4-PDE system
killer cells positioned in corner
prey evenly distributed
movie 2 ( 3D , 2D )
5-PDE system
killer cells positioned in corner
prey evenly distributed
movie 3 ( 3D , 2D )
5-PDE system
killer cells positioned in corner
prey evenly distributed
1/1000 AI-2 production rate
movie 4 ( 3D , 2D )
5-PDE system
killer cells positioned in corner
prey evenly distributed
8-fold chemotactic activity towards AI-2
movie 5 ( 3D , 2D )
5-PDE system
killer cells evenly distributed
