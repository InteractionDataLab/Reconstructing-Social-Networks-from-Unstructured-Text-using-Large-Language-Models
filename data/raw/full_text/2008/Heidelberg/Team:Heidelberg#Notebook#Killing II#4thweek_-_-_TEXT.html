Control of Cloning -> see activity test
Activity Test
To check if we have one positive clone we perform the sender activity test again (see Fridayday 08/08/22 for plate scheme and details). After the first measurements an increase in GFP expression by BBa_T9002 was observed for colonies 9, 10, 11. Because of that we inoculated liquid ONC with LB-Kana for miniprepes and glycerolstocks

Sequencing results: ColE1_prot correct. Others were not sequenced.
New attempt of second digestion: no bands are visible.
New cloning strategy:

Transformation of ON-Ligation
Activity Test
Results:
OD Measurement of colicin treated ONCs. An effect in cultures of Mytomycin C stressed cells were observed. But this could also be the toxic effect of Mytomycin C. In addition we obtained that we used a too high concentration of Mytomycin C (1 µg/ml instead of 0.1 µg/ml).
Measured cell growth curve over night: Logistic growth could be observed but in general growth curve does not look that good.
