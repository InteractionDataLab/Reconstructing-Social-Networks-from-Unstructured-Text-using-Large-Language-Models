project planning
cloning design: plasmid with constitutive promoter (Barbara) :
pBR322(Pbla promotor)? Wait for answer of orther research group
restriction sites: no found (alternative: PCR?)
New plasmid with cI are found (promotor?)
technics checking: on work
First Group Meeting
Team: Barbara, Jens, Anna, Chistian, Maximilian, Stephen, Yin
Work in the follow days:
check the MoBi technics to handle lambda phage
extract DNA from the packed virus (produce a easy protocoll <lyse capsid>? Kit?)
argarose gel not seemly for lambda with over 35kb (alternative methods?)
alternative for mini-prep (Kit?)
cloning protocoll?
in vitro packing and transduction (Kit?) or electroporation?
get the help plasmid (wait and write)
testdigestions of lambda cI- phage from ZMBH practical lab (and try to get map from Dr.Mayer?)
check if there are some lambda phage that we can buy (cI-mutant / xis, int deleted)
Tuesday, 08/05/08
project planning
lambda DNA cI857 from Fermentas ordered (heat inducible cI promotor)
Quigen lambda-extraction kit ordered
experimental procedure:
test methods for AGE with lambda phage DNA
transformation of Phagen-DNA - testing, selection through swaping temperature, infection needs maltose
create CI Plasmid with constitutive promotor
OriT and AB-Kasette (if possible from the registry) put in a plasmid, therefore we need to know which helper plasmid to use, so we know which oriT to use
testconjugation with the helperplasmid - (how to test it - GFP or AB-resistence?)
put part 3 in phage vector
Sensing Part - control a Relaxase gene through AutoinducerI and knock it out on the helper plasmid
Parts for the Registry:
cI with a constitutive promotor
AB-Kasette with promotor
lambda DNA ?
Problems
Which OriT, and therefore we have to know which helper plasmid we use?
we would use 3 plasmids in the end, so 3 differen antibiotic resistances - the one of the helper plasmid cannot be influenced by us
look for suitable restriction sites in the lambda genome
selection when using in vitro packaging
host range of the phage

project planning
Hi all, we finally received several answers for the conjugation plasmids. Prof. Erich Lanka, who is now retired, will look for pUB307 in his stocks in Berlin  and will contact me again once he has it. I am thinking of asking for  his scientific advice, since he also worked with phages...  We also received an answer from two professors in the states (actually also another one, who said she did not have pUB307). I copy here the email of one of these, since it gives us something to  think about:
Dear Barbara: I do not have the plasmid pUB307.  We did, in the past, use helpers to  transfer plasmids that have an oriT by conjugation.  I am not sure  I understand what exactly you wanted to do.  do you already have the  lambda with an oriT inserted? If yes, which oriT do you have there?   If it is the oriT of RSF1010 then the best helper plasmid for its  transfer would be a derivative of RP4 (same as RK2).   There are strains that have this plasmid integrated in the chromosome so they do not transfer the helper, just the mobilizable plasmid.   If you need the RSF1010 oriT I and the strain containing the  integrated RP4 we can send these to you.  Please note, however,  that the "oriT" is not just the transfer origin.  It requires two or  three genes that are located near the origin and that specify proteins required to attach to the oriT and perform a strand-specific and site-specific nick.  One would have to insert this whole fragment  into the lambda to make it mobilizable. If you have any questions on this, please do not hesitate to write.
Michael
I will reply explaining better our plans, hopefully he has some good ideas :)
Keep up with the good work, hopefully soon we will have the plasmids to try the conjugation!

chloramphenicol resistance cassette
Mini Prep P1004 (B0014 B0015 no growth)
transformation for p1004,1000, B0014,0015 again
result: colonies exist, inoculate on sunday
lambda phage and cI
infection test on StI Maltose Soft Plattes
Top10+Lambda 10^7
MG+Lambda 10^7
MG+Lambda 10^5
Result incubate 37C 18h Platte not on Head, so wat!!
Top10 complett lysed
Top10 cI complett lysed (not good)
MG Lambda 10^7 complett lysed
MG cI Lambda 10^7 complett lysed with very big colonies
MG cI Lambda 10^5 plaques
MG Lambda 10^5 plaques, more than MG cI
problems
plattes were wat
soft agar was sometimes not hart enough (mix!!!)
maltose makes the infectionrate much higher - Lambda concentration should be reduced
concentration of the cI mini prep
C:36,244ng/ul; D:18,035ng/ul;
digestion the mini prep BBa_J01101 C and D with HindIII and Scf I
result: not good
ligation and transformation of lambda 857
2ul lambda (600ng),2ul 10xligation buffer, 1ul DNA T4ligase, 15ulH2O, at RT ca.60min, transform 10ul into 100ul cells(Top10, MG), 30C 18h, 42C 24h
result:0 plaque by top10, 5 plaques by MG
project planning
Guys, Prof. Bagdasarian replied:
Dear Barbara: I don't know whether this particular integrated RP4 may be excised from the chromosome and whether it will function as autonomous plasmid. We will send you, on Monday, a strain that carries an autonomous RP4 and a strain carrying the chromosomal RP4 and a small plasmid that contains the "minimal functional oriT" inserted into that plasmid as a NdeI fragment.  This derivative is mobilizable at high frequency from that strain due to the "help" of the integrated RP4. You can use either of the strains to PCR-amplify the oriT and, if necessary, add desired sequences with restriction sites to it. Good luck,
Michael
So next week we will hopefully receive the stuff we need to go on with out project :) I hope the ligation works to get lambda into E. coli... Keep me updated, as always.
Ciao, Barbara
