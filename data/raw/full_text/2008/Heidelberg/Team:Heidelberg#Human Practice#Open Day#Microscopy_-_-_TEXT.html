Here you get an impression on what the pubils explored in the microscopy station. [ back to previous page ]
Cells taken from the oral mucosa are stained with Hoechst and Lysotracker Red in salt-buffer (Krebs-Henseleit). Hoechst is a blue fluorescend dye intercalating into the minor groove of the DNA, thus visualizing the nucleus. Lysotracker Red consists of a red fluorophore coupled to a weak base that accumulates in acidic organelles like lysosomes. A Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope is used for image aquisition.
Cells of the oral mucosa covered with bacteria (Hoechst stain)
Cells of the oral mucosa focused to the nucleus (Hoechst stain)
Montage: Cells of the oral mucosa covered with bacteria. Blue color indicates the nucleus and bacterial DNA, Red color stains acidic compartments and gives a diffuse background in the cytosol.
