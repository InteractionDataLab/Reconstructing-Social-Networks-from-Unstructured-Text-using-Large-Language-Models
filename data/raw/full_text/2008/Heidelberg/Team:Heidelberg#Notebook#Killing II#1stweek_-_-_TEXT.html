Colicin Receiver
Cloning
Transformation of miniPrep DNA of Receiver+GFP part (BBa_T9002) for Glycerolstocks in TOP10 cells: 5 µl per 100 µl E. coli TOP 10 competent cells
- start thawing 100 µl competent E. coli TOP 10 cells on crushed ice - add 5 µl ligation - incubate on ice for 20 minutes - heat shock at 42 °C for 45 sec - incubate 2 min on ice - add 400 µl preheated LB media - incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, 500 rpm - Plate 200 µl on preheated LB-Amp plate - incubate overnight at 37 °C
Planings for Receiver - Colicin cloning:
use part BBa_T9002 and substitute GFP with colicin genes
use part BBa_F2621 or BBa_F2622 insert colicin cassette behind Lux PR (MCS)
Sender part
Cloning
Transformation of sender (BBa_F1610) and amplifier part (BBa_I15030) (Transformationprotocol Chris): 5 µl per 100 µl E. coli TOP 10 competent cells
- start thawing 100 µl competent E. coli TOP 10 cells on crushed ice - add 5 µl ligation - incubate on ice for 20 minutes - heat shock at 42 °C for 45 sec - incubate 2 min on ice - add 400 µl preheated LB media - incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, 500 rpm - Plate 200 µl on preheated LB-Amp plate - incubate overnight at 37 °C

Colicin Receiver
Cloning
Transformation results:
many colonies on receiver plates
Transformation BBa_F2621 and BBa_F2622 in TOP 10 cells (Transformationprotocol Chris): 5 µl per 100 µl E. coli TOP 10 competent cells
- start thawing 100 µl competent E. coli TOP 10 cells on crushed ice - add 5 µl ligation - incubate on ice for 20 minutes - heat shock at 42 °C for 45 sec - incubate 2 min on ice - add 400 µl preheated LB media - incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, 500 rpm - Plate 200 µl on preheated LB-Amp plate - incubate overnight
Activity tests
Inoculation of liquid cultures with TOP10 and receiver+GFP transformed TOP10 cells for a quantitative measurement of the GFP expression induced by AI-1.
Sender part
Cloning
Transformation results:
small colonies on sender and amplifier plates
Inoculation of liquid cultures for glycerol stocks of amplifier, sender and receiver+GFP parts: For each part we picked 6 colonies and incubated them on LB:antibiotics (1000:1) media over night

Colicin Receiver
Cloning
Mail to help@registry.com to order BBa_F1610, BBa_I15030, BBa_F2621 & BBa_F2622 because several transformation attempts did not work.
Transformation results (08/05/2008):
BBa_F2621 and BBa_F2622 in TOP 10 cells were not grown
Glycerol Stocks of Receiver+GFP TOP10 cells (BBa_T9002)

Mail to help@registry.com to order BBa_F1610, BBa_I15030, BBa_F2621 & BBa_F2622 because several transformation attempts did not work.
New plan: If we do not receive the LuxI sender part from the registry, we amplify the LuxI gene from Vibrio fischeri genome. For that we have to design primers with restriction sites for pBAD MCS:
