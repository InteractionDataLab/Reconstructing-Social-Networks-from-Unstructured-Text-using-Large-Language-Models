pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Miniprep of ONC: eluted in 30 µl H2O (Qiagen, Miniprepkit)
Controldigestion of Minipreps: 2 h -> 37 °C, 15 min -> 65 °C
10.0 µl DNA  3.0 µl H2O  2.0 µl NEBuffer I (NEB)  1.5 µl XbaI (20 000 U/ml, NEB)  1.5 µl SpeI (10 000 U/ml, NEB)  2.0 µl BSA 10x (NEB) ------- 20.0 µl
Gel of digestion: 1% Agarose, 37 min, 135V
Gelresults:
Expected Fragments:
pSB1A3 ~2000 bp
T9002_without_GFP ~1088 bp
The expected fragments were not visible. maybe the cloning was not succesfull.
Digestion of Miniprpes with SpeI only for further cloninf, because double digestion with BamHI is not recommed. 2 h -> 37 °C, 10 min -> 65 °C
Gel of Digestion: 1% Agarose, 30 min, 135 V
PCR of Minipreps of "positive" clones: To check if we have positive clones we make PCR of the Minipreps we made.
25.0 µl Phusion MasterMix (Finnzymes, NEB)  2.5 µl Primer fw (T9002_Lux_pR_SpeI_BamHI_RBS)  2.5 µl Primer rv (T9002_fw_XbaI) 18.0 µl H2O  2.0 µl DNA-Template ------- 50.0 µl
program: 98 °C  30 sec 98 °C  10 sec     | 58 °C  30 sec     | 25 cycles 72 °C  45 sec     | 72 °C   5 min  4 °C  constant
Gel of PCR products: 1% Agarose, 135 V, 30 min
Gelresults:
Expected Fragments:
T9002_without_GFP ~1088 bp
In each probe there is a fragment of ~1500 bp. We expect that this is a form of undigested plasmid. That means that if the PCR worked properly we have no positive clones. To recheck the Minipreps we try an additional PCR with our old protocoll (no Phusion MasterMix).
PCR of Minipreps of "positive" clones: To check if we have positive clones we make PCR of the Minipreps we made.
10.0 µl 5x Phusion HF Buffer (Finnzymes, NEB)  1.0 µl 10 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen)  2.5 µl Primer fw (T9002_Lux_pR_SpeI_BamHI_RBS)  2.5 µl Primer rv (T9002_fw_XbaI) 31.5 µl H2O  2.0 µl DNA-Template  0.5 µl Phusion DNA-Polymerase (Finnzymes, NEB) ------- 50.0 µl
program: 98 °C  30 sec 98 °C  10 sec     | 59 °C  30 sec     | 25 cycles 72 °C  45 sec     | 72 °C   5 min  4 °C  constant
HisTag cloning of Colicins for purification
Digestion of Minipreps with BamHI/HindIII for Colicin E1 and BamHI/XmaI for ColicinE9His: We want to select the positivt clones.
Gel of Digestion: 1% Agarose, 135 V, 30 min
Gelresults:
Expected Fragments ColE1:
~1580 bp (Insert)
~3400 bp (Backbone)
Expected Fragments ColE9:
~1580 bp (Insert)
~3400 bp (Backbone)
None of the inserts is there. Maybe we have only religated backbone. Or maybe only one enzyme cutted the DNA.
PCR of Minipreps to check if there are any positive clones. Programm see pSB1A2-Receiver-Cloning. Primers:
Colicin E1:
ColE1_prot_fw_BamHI
ColE1_kil_prot_rv_SpeI
Colicin E9:
ColE9_prot_fw_BamHI
ColE9_prot_rv_HindIII
Gel of ColicinE1 PCR: 1% Agarose, 135V, 30 min
Gel of ColicinE9 PCR: 1% Agarose, 135V, 30 min
Gelresults of PCR: There were no psitive bands for each PCR. But we used the wrong reverse primers. Because of that we started a new PCR with the right reverse primers (see protocol at pSB1A3-Receiver cloning)

pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Kontrolgel of PCR (09/16/2008) to select positive clones.
Gelresults: positive clones should contain fragments at 1088 bp. Only the colonies 76-80 & 81 - 85 have a dimm band with this size. This could be a positive clone.

ColE9 His PCR-Screen for selection of positive clones: 1% Agarose , 135 V, 30 min, expected fragment size ~630 bp
Gelrsults: probes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 & 8 have bands with the right fragment size.
