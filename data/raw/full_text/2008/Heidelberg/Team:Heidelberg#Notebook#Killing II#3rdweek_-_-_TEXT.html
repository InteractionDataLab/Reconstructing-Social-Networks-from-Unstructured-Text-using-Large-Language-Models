Colicin Receiver
Cloning
Literature research on different E. coli strains to see if they have BtuB receptor. This receptor is necessary for transport through the outer cellmembran in the prey cells. MG1655 and TOP 10 have these receptors. For DH5alpha we found no clear information.

pBAD - Cloning
Transformation of pBAD18 into TOP10 cells to amplify the plasmid.

Colicin Receiver
Cloning
Maxiprep of pColE9-J: CompactPrep Plasmid Mxi Kit 25, Qiagen
Inoculation of liquid culture with pColE1 cells:
Data of DSMZ homepage :
Plasmid name: ColE1
Other collection No: JC411
Marker: E1imm
DSMZ-Nr: 3877
Molecular Weight: 6.6 kb
Host:E. coli JC411
Remarks: Naturally occurring plasmid; cells with plasmid ColE1 produce immunity proteins rendering the host immune to the lethal effects of the homologous colicin; non-transmissible; unique restriction site for EcoRI; non-conjugative; 10 - 15 copies per cell; amplifiable.
Medium:
10.0 g Tryptone  5.0 g Yeast extract 10.0 g NaCl  1.0 L H2O +0.1 % Glucose
Opening of the glass vial:
Double vial is closed under vacuum. Heat end of vial in a flame. Put 2-3 water drops on the spike to let the glass splitt. Use forceps to remove splitted end. Take out the inner vial. Remove the cotton plug and treat the inner side of the vial with flames. Put 0.5 ml of the media into the vial, and put the cotton plug back. Incubate 30 mins for 37 °C Stir solution with an inoculation loop an mix with 5 ml medium. Plate 100 µl of liquid culture on LB agarplate Incubate liquidculture and agarplate at 37 °C ON

Cloning strategy of pBAD-Sender:
Amplification of BBa_F1610 with pSB_ins_fw & pSB_ins_rv
Use XbaI and PstI site to clone into MCS of pBAD18 plasmid
Digestion of BBa_F1610 and pBAD 18 with PstI and XbaI: Incubation 1.5 h -> 37°C
10.0 µl DNA  3.0 µl NEBuffer 3  3.0 µl BSA 10x  3.0 µl XbaI  2.0 µl PstI  9.0 µl H2O ------- 30.0 µl
Gelextraction of digestion: Upper band of F1610 seems to be once cutted
Ligation with insert:vector ratio 3:1: 1h -> RT, Inactivation: 10 min -> 65 °C
6.0 µl Insert  2.0 µl Vector  2.0 µl 10x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (Fermentas)  1.0 µl T4 DNA Ligase (Fermentas)  9.0 µl H2O ------- 20.0 µl
Transformation into E. coli TOP 10 cells (Transformation protocol Chris)
Cloning possibly not works because PstI cuts twice in pBAD18

Sender part
pBAD-Sender Cloning
Cloning Results are tested via a activity test
Activity Test
ONC was used for a sender activity test. The following graph shows the plate scheme for the test. (S = sender, R = Receiver, 1:5 = Sender:Receiver ratio 1:5 ...)
Cells were incubated and GFP intensity as well as OD were measured every 2 hours. After 2 hours we obtained that we forget to induce LuxI production with arabinose. Because of that 2 µl of a 10% arabinose dilution was putted in every well.
