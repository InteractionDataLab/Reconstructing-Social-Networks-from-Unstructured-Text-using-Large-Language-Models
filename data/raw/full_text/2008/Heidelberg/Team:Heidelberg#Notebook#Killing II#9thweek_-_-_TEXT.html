pSB1A3-Receiver-Colicin cloning
Receiver-Colicin E9/E9_lys
Sequencing results: The colonies 34, 35 and 47 contains the right insert. But the sequences behind the BioBrick Suffix do not fit to pSB1A3 vector. The sequence which we received from GATC has 78 bp less than the one from partsregistry.org. To fix this problem we aligned our sequencing results against the pSB1A2 vector and they fit perfect. Because of that we assume that our BBa_T9002 is inside the pSB1A2 vector and not as expected in the pSB1A3 vector.
Sequencing results: The colonies 61 and 63 contains the right insert, but like ColE9lys in pSB1A2 vector.

pSB1A2-Receiver-Colicin cloning
By sequencing we figured out, that the plasmid-backbone we used (and are still using) is not the pSB1A3 as it should be but the pSB1A2. Sequencing of the registery part BBa_T9002, where we cut out the plasmid-backbone we are using, affirmed that this part is not on the pSB1A3 plasmid as mentioned but on the pSB1A2. Because we have no working registry part on a pSB1A3 plasmid available in lab, we decided to continue with the pSB1A2 backbone and will also do our standardization with this plasmid.
Sequencing results of T9002/GFP_ColE1 cloning
two of the sequenced colonies gave positive results: Colony 6 and Colony 39
--> two positive colE1 cloning constructs: T9002/GFP_ColE1.6 and T9002/GFP_ColE1.39
Continuance of T9002/GFP_colE9 and _colE9lys cloning for standardization (with correct pre-/suffixes)
gel (0,7 %, 135 V, 60 min) of the restriction digest done yesterday (EcoRI + PstI) with the samples for the backbone (61, 63, 63)
pSB1A2 at ~2000 bp where cut out
gel extraction with these bands (61, 63, 63) and PCR purification with the restriction digests done yesterday (EcoRI + PstI) with the samples ColE9 and ColE9lys. An additional made analytical gel of these two samples reminded us, that the colE9 fragment contains an EcoRI site inside the fragment. For this reason, we could not use the digested colE9 fragment and continued the cloning only with the colE9lys fragment.
overnight ligation of pSB1A2 (9,1 ng/µl) and colE9lys (14,4 ng/µl)
2 µl T4 ligase buffer 10x (Fermentas)  2 µl T4 ligase (Fermentas)  13 µl ColE9lys  3 µl pSB1A2 ----- 20 µl
