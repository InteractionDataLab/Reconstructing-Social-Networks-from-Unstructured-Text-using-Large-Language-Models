oriT
there are already OriTs available at the registry, OriTs for F and for R - helper plasmids. They are mostly combined with transposons for mutagenesis experiments. but there are few parts with a confmirmed sequence:
J01003: OriT sequence in pSB1A2 (278 bp)
I714031: OriT sequence (of R 751 plasmid) in pSB1A2 (371 bp)
both of the parts did not pass the iGEM quality control - no insert could be seen after restriction digestion. we will transform both OriTs and make conjugation tests to see if they are functional. If not, we would still be the first group to add a functional OriT for R-helper plasmids.
first attempt to transform these OriTs out of the registry did not work...
Phage cloning strategy one
miniprep of possible lambda DNA (from colonies of ligation)
nanodrop evaluation of minipreps
2: 186,0 ng/µl
3: 269,5 ng/µl
7: 244,5 ng/µl
9: 264,5 ng/µl
10: 245,5 ng/µl
all assays were clean ~1,87
digestion with SpeI/XmaI (last lane: SpeI/ApaLI)
--> seems not to be a lambda phage but rather religated pBluescript
Mutagnesis PCRs of pBlue::insert to delete the XbaI restriction sites
digestion with DpnI, 2h at 37°C
transformation in TOP10
inoculation of I20260::CmR 1-3, reference promotor, pBlue::Insert, pBluescript instead of Top10 in 5ml LB

Phage cloning strategy one
preparation of in vitro packaging media
supplemented LB-Broth
supplemented Agar
phage dilution buffer
for detailed protocols see main page - protocols
GFP-measurement with the TECAN of TOP10 including pBluescript with the insert
the GFP::CmR construct in pBluescript does not express GFP!!!
bicistronic gene assembly does not work!!
inoculation of the cells possible containing the lambda phage for GFP meausurement
Wednesday, 09/24/08
Phage cloning strategy one
digestion of the lambda phage with XbaI, XhoI (protocol described previously)
GFP measurement with TECAN of the cells containing possibly the lambda phage
no GFP expression could be observed!
