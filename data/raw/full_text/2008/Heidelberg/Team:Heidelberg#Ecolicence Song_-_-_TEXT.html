Ecolicence to Kill
Hey baby, think you need a friend to save you from disease?
Yes you do!
Oh baby, our killer E. coli makes deadly pathogens freeze.
I would bet, they will never escape you
Once our killers sensend them, tooooo.-
Ecolicence to kill
walking straight into the pathogen heart
Ecolicence to kill
they'll cure you, throwing all the marplots apart
Ecolicence to kill!!
Ecolicence to kill!! (interplay)
Hey baby, see them swimming in direction of the evil play
Yes, I do!
Oh baby, the evil unintentional lead our killers the right way
They are fast, they are sure on their deadly role,
and they're under our control... yeahhh!
Ecolicence to kill
swimming streight forward the pathogen path
Ecolicence to kill
they'll cure you, throwing all the marplots apart
Ecolicence to kill!!
They show their deadly blowgnun at these ptho-fries,
secriting death-stuff, they see the horror in their eyes,
they'd better know, that they souldn't have come that way,
today is their dying day
today is their dying day
today is their dying day!!!
Ecolicence to kill
having done their deadly mission precise
Ecolicence to kill
they'll cure you, and again you feel nice
Ecolicence to kill!!
Ecolicence to kill
