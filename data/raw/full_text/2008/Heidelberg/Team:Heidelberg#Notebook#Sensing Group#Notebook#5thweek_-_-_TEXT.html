1.selection for Fusion-1 and Fusion-2 cloning
the DNA of the colonies was extracted with MINIprep, and then screen with test digestion: PstI (NEBuffer 3 + BSA)
for Fusion-1: if our insert is there: one band of 6101 bp if no inser: two bands: 4388 + 2213 bp
for Fusion-2: if our insert is there: one band of 6122 bp if no inser: two bands: 4388 + 2213 bp
