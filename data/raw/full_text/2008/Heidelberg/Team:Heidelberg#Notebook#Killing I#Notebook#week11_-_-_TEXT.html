pcr with standard plasmid primers (VF2, VR) using Taq
12 pcr samples (1-6 only one colony, 7-12 three colonies)
Gel
lane0: dna ladder mix
lane1-12: screening sample 1-12
expected fragment length: ca. 500-600bp
-->sample 3 and 5 look good
-->inoculation of overnight cultures
-->sequencing of 3 and 5
sequencing results match perfect
Phage cloning strategy two
Mutagenesis PCR of pBlue with insert to remove KpnI restriction site
using turbo Pfu
elongation: 12,5min
DpnI digestion 2h at 37°C
transformation in TOP10, plated out on Cm plate
Phage cloning strategy one
mutation of old insert in pBluescript
pBluescript + insert was cut with BamHI --> the resulting backbone cut out of the gel and religated. With this vector 2 mutagenesis PCRs were done to eleminate the two remaining XbaI restriction sites.
The resulting vector was digested with XbaI/XhoI to get the insert with the correct restriction sites for ligation into lambda phage
Characterization of oriT
Inoculate the cells for conjugation test

Centrifuge 350ul overnight culture in 1.5ml eppi for 2min at 13000rpm, 8samples donor, 8samples recipient
Wash the pellet twice with LB medium
Resolve the pellet in 350ul LB medium
Centrifuge the washed recipient for 2min at 13000rpm, discard the fluid
Add the washed donor suspension
Vortex and resolve the pellet
Centrifuge the mix for 1min at 13000rpm
