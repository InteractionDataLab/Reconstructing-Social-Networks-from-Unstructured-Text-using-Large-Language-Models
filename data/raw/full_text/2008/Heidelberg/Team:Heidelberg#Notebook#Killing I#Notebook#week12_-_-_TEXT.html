Proceedings of phage cloning strategy one
the fully mutated insert in pBluescript SK II was digested with XbaI/XhoI and the insert extracted from the gel
lambda DNA was also cut with XbaI/XhoI and the backbone also extracted from the gel.
the insert was ligated in the lambda backbone over night using standard ligation methods

Proceedings of phage cloning strategy one
colonies could grow in chloramphenicol containing medium --> samll aliquots were transferred in ampicillin containing medium to check for the resisitance
colony PCRs were conducted to ensure that our insert is embedded in the growing cells
PCR with specific primers for the insert. Primers were dierected on the chloramphenicol resitance cassette. All three samples lead to a band in the correct hight as indicated from the positive control. Unmodified λ DNA was used as negative control.
pUB307 was transferred in cells harboring our modified lambda phage by conjugation --> plating on Cm + Kan

4 Control digestions to check wheter the ligation was successful or not
lane0: DNA ladder mix
lane1: XbaI/XhoI: 3,9kb / 2,9kb  (NEB2, BSA)
lane2: DraI: 1,85kb / 1,8kb / 1,35kb / 780bp / 692bp/ 339bp/ 19bp  (NEB4)
lane3: SacI/SpeI: 4.5kb / 1.3kb / 929bp / 34bp    (NEB1,BSA)
lane4: SfcI: 3.1kb / 1.3kb / 1.1kb / 678bp / 247bp / 192bp   (NEB4, BSA)
we got the correct pBluescript with the insert of phage cloning strategy two
Saturday, 10/25/08
Proceedings of phage cloning strategy one
we got colonies on the plates with ampicillin and chloramphenicol only when our conjugated cultures were brought out, but not if T9002 or the cells harboring pUB307 and our phage were brought out separately
this shows that our phage can be transported by conjugation
