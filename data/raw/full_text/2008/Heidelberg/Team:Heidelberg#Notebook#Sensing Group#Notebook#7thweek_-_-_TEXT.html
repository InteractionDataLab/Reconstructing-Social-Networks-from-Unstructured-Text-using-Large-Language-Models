Digestion of Fusion 1+2 with PstI (NEBuffer 3 + BSA)
Digestion of Fusion constructs with PstI. All, except Fusion 1 colony 2 of NcoI/NdeI cloning, seem to be positive
F1+2 2,3 (KpnI), F1+2 1,3 (NdeI) sent to sequencing @ GATC
F2 NdeI #3, F1 NdeI #1, F1 KpnI #2 seem to be correct

Digestion of LuxP  from glycerol stock and from bench culture. Both are positive.
Digestion of LuxP (Glycerol-Stock and cultures from Bench) with NcoI (NEBuffer 3) to check if correct
O/N cultures of LuxP cells from Glycerol stock
