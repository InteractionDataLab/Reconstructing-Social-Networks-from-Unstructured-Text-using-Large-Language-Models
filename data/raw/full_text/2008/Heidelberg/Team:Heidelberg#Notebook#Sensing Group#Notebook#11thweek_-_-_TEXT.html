Fusion-PCR for LuxS standardization with Phusion
30s @ 98°C || 10s @ 98°C | 30s @ 55°C | 1min @ 72°C || 5min @ 72°C | 4°C (30 cycles)
Tuesday, 10/14/2008
PCR Purification, Digestion of LuxS and pSB2K3 with EcoRI/PstI (EcoRI buffer + BSA). 1h @ 37°C
Fusion PCR for LuxS with Phusion and Annealing Temperature Gradient (50-60°C)
Fused LuxS parts for standardization seem positive
Transformation of Fusion-YFP into MG1655
Wednesday, 10/15/2008
PCR Purification of LuxS_standard and F1-GeneArt, F2-GeneArt
Digestion of LuxS and Fusion Constructs with EcoRI/PstI (NEBuffer EcoRI + BSA)
Digestion of LuxS with EcoRI/xbaI (NEBuffer2 + BSA) to check for restriction sites
Cloning into pSB2K3
Test Digestion of LuxS with EcoRI and xbaI to test if mutation was successful
Digestion of Fusion1-YFP and Fusion2-YFP constructs with BamHI
LuxS digestions with EcoRI and xbaI to test for successful mutagenesis
Digestion of LuxS to test for mutations and Fusion-YFP with BamHI constructs to confirm insert.
Inoculation of 50µl Fusion-YFP O/N culture in 5mL LB. Incubation for 2h @ 37°C. Induction of Fusion-YFP cells with 0.01% Arabinose for 3h. Visualization under microscope
Expression of Fusion-Receptor positive for both constructs. Even Localization to the membrane can be seen in some cells.
Fluorescence Image of Fusion1-YFP
Fluorescence Image of Fusion2-YFP

Picked 16 LuxS colonies and Inoculation in LB-Kan
Inoculation of UU1250 cells containing Fusion constructs
Friday, 10/17/2008
Miniprep of LuxS and Fusion constructs
Digestion of LuxS with EcoRI/PstI (NEBuffer EcoRI + BSA) and Fusion with BamHI/PstI (NEBuffer 3 + BSA)
Digestion of LuxS with EcoRI/PstI. Positive clones show two bands
Sequencing @ GATC reveal that mutagenesis did not work. bcause restriction sites are still there.
