Miniprep of LuxS+pDK6 and F1/F2-Luxp-pBAD33
Digestion of GeneArt Fusion constructs with EcoRI/PstI (NEBuffer EcoRI + BSA) and Gel-Extraction
Digestion of GeneArt Fusion constructs with EcoRI/PstI (NEBuffer EcoRI + BSA) and Gel-Extraction
Wednesday, 10/01/2008
Miniprep of Fusion-LuxP-pBAD33 (both constructs)
Digestion of pSB1A3 with EcoRI,PstI,NdeI (3µl DNA, 40 µl total volume)
Digestion of pSB2K3 (10µl DNA, 20µl total volume) with EcoRI/PstI (NEBuffer EcoRI + BSA)
PCR GeneArt Fusion constructs with Prefix/Suffix primer yielded no product. F1/F2 with prefix/speI primer were positive, but mutation strategy dropped later. A mix of LuxS and pDK6 was added on the gel to check if double transformation was successfull. Digestions of pSB1A3 and pSB2K3 with EcoRI/Pst were supposed to be used for subsequent standardization of parts

PCR like yesterday overnight, but with 42°C annealing and as template with EcoRI/PstI digested Fusion constructs
Maxiprep of GeneArt Fusion Constructs and pSB2K3
PCR Purification of F1/F2 Prefix/SpeI PCR products
Digestion of F1-prefix/SpeI and F2-prefix/SpeI with EcoRI/SpeI (NEBuffer EcoRI + BSA,610 bp band)
Digestion of F1/F2-LuxP-pDK48 with EcoRI,NotI,XbaI
4686 bp
1330 bp (wanted band)
599 bp
587 bp
Mutagenesis PCR of LuxS (LuxSmutF/LuxSmutR) and LuxP (LuxPmutF/LuxPmutR) overnight
Friday, 10/03/2008
Digestion of mutagenesis PCR products with DpnI, 1h @ 37 °C
--> Analysis on 1% Agarose-Gel --> No band visible
Ligation of F1/2 (GA) with pSB1A3 and pSB2K3, 1h @ RT
--> Transformation into DH5a. Plated over weekend.
