proceeding: PCR with CmR primers, but they can't be found
proceeding: sequencing of CmR in pBlue
proceeding: digest again with a smaller amount of Miniprep DNA
proceeding: digest with other enzymes to check if it's pBlue
Checking the insert of J01003
25µl Phusion Master Mix 1µl StandardFW 1µl StandardRV 1µl Maxiprep DNA (1:100) 22µl water
PCR protocol 95°C 30s 95°C 30s   | 55°C 45s   | 16x 68°C 14min | 4°C for ever
insert has a length about 1,2kb
--> should be about 600bp
maxiprep of two oriTs in pSB1A2 --> both were sequenced and digested with EcoRI/PstI
result: oriT12 is T9002 (from sequencing) but oriT7 fits (digestion and sequencing) even though the sequencing with the forward primer was not succesful.
our J01003 which we got from the MIT seems not to be correct!! After digestion with EcoRI/PstI there should appear a band at ~400bp but it runs at ~1200bp. This result was reproduced twice. Nevertheless it seems to be an oriT since it works succesfull in conjugation tests. We will prep it again next week from the glycerolstock and reepeat the digestion to make sure we did not contaminate it.
