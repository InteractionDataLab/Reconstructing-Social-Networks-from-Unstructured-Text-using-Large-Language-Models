Photogallery: Info and Survey Day
[ back to previous page ]
the kids were faszinated...
and even the grown ups had much fun
concentated the public filled up our survey-sheets; sometimes in groups...
sometimes combined with some small-talk with the one or other charming student :)
Enthousiastic: Did she fill out the survey ore write down her mobile phone number??
it's magic... the kids were impressed by the little experiments we brought with us...
...not only the kids
here you see our stand
"what is inside this round bottle?"
"I don't know- but i'll keep it anyway"
we had nice and good-looking public ;) ...
... and thus got first results already after short time
the girl concentrated...
... and Philipp fascinated :-)
everybody was happy...
...the sun was shining...
...young and old...
...together to join...
our info and survey day- we had a great time! And thanks to the active public we got many completed surveys
