ureD promoter
An urea sensor, which is able to form a complex with urea binding proteins and functions as a promoter.

The source of urea sensor is the bacteria, Proteus mirabilis, whose genome is still under sequencing (2008-Aug). The operon regulating urea-associated genes had been published many years ago. See J. Bacteriol. 175 (2), 465-473 (1993)
Since the genome of Proteus mirabilis is still undersequencing, we choose Helicobacter pylori as the source of urea transporter. See Nature 397 (6715), 176-180 (1999). These associated geens are also found in several plasmids in certain strains of enterobacteria.

OmpF promoter that is activated or repressesed by OmpR according to osmolarity.
Promoter OmpF is activated by phosphorylated OmpR at low osmolarity, and is repressesed by phosphorylated OmpR at high osmolarity.In Escherichia coli, osmoregulation is mediated in part by the actions of such a two-component system consisting of EnvZ and OmpR. These proteins
act to control the relative levels of the outer membrane porin genes, ompF and ompC. At low osmo larity, OmpF predominates in the outer membrane, while   at   high   osmolarity   the   OmpF   porin   is replaced by OmpC.OmpF has a larger pore and a faster ¯ow rate than OmpC.

The protein domains from the left-most and right-most side of CIII have been removed (the grayed out parts), i.e. amino acid residues #2-13 and #42-49 have been excluded, leaving residues #1 (start codon), #14-41 (the protein domain in the middle) and #55 (stop codon).
HtlB also degrades CIII, creating competitive degradation reactions. We removed the leftmost and right most protein domains since _someone_ et al said that removing these two protein domains will stop HtlB from degrading CIII. Doing this makes it easier to predict and model.
