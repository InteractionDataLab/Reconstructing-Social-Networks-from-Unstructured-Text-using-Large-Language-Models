About Us
Contents
1 Motivation
2 Goal
3 Circuit Design
3.1 Regulation of nhaA gene expression
3.2 Structure of nhaA gene promoter
4 References
5 Experiments
5.1 NhaA promoter under 300uM sodium and pH 3.0, 7.0, 8.5
Motivation
When our system arrives in the intestine (pH is higher), it senses the pH change and starts to work.
In this subsystem, we are going to create a pH sensor which senses high pH's.
Goal
The pH sensor can sense a high pH condition and start gene expression.
Circuit Design
Regulation of nhaA gene expression
Na1-Induced Transcription of nhaA, Which Encodes an Na1/H1 Antiporter in Escherichia coli, Is Positively Regulated by nhaR and Affected by hns (N. DOVER etc.,1996)
Molecular physiology of the Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli (E Padan and S Schuldiner, 1994)
Structure of nhaA gene promoter
Transcription of nhaA, the Main Na+/H+ Antiporter of Escherichia coli, Is Regulated by Na+ and Growth Phase (Nir Dover and Etana Padan et al.,2001)
17,189 -17,488 in E.coli K12 genome from Ecocyc (300 bp upstream of nhaA gene)

G is the start of NhaR binding site
TTTTAA is the first -35 of P1
ATGATT is the second -35 of P1
TAAAAT is the first -10 of P1
TAAAAA is the second -10 of P1; A in the TAAAAA is the first TSS of P1
AAGAGA is the S.D. (Shine-Dalgarno) sequence in RBS
There are 3 nhaA promoter sequences protected by NhaR from DNase I digestion
AATAGCTCGTAAAAAACGAATTATTCC
CACTATAATCTGATTTTAACGATG
CGTGCGGGGTAAAATAGTAAAAACGATCTATTCACCT; T in TTCACCT is the second TSS of P1
The extracted DNA sequence should include the NhaR binding site
The NhaR binding site defined in (Nir Dover and Etana Padan et al.,2001) is 120 bp long
The PCR product derived from primers designed by Henry is 274 bp long
