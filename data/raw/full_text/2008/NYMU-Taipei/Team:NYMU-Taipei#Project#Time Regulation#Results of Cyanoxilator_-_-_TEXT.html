successfully pcr back-SasA
successfully pcr front-RpaA
comment:
successfully pcr back-RpaA and front-SasA; however they are too weak and we encountered a little bit of trouble doing overlap extension PCR
action:
gel extraction
re-design the primer of FP-in RpaA and RP-in SasA
Reporting assay
Date

GFP expression
Protocol & Comments
9/29
The M9 does not seems to have enough nutrition for E. coli to grow.
10/4
9/30
* For the 3 hr measure, the plate was not washed carefully, so there is a large background.
10/4
Discussion of the reporting
Is the freshness of the bacteria important to GFP expression? If so, we should use freshly streaked plates.
The white and black plates must be cleaned carefully, otherwise there would be too much background.
pBF seemes to grow much faster than the others.
