Background
Phosphate-related Medical Syndromes
Goal and Circuit Operation
Enhance and regulate the phosphate absorption of E.coli to balance phosphate concentration to a normal level in patients with kidney failure
This device operates when:
external pH is high and
external phosphate level is high
That is, this device will stop when:
external pH is low or
external phosphate level is low
Circuit Design
NYMU iGEM08 phosphate removal device v 1.0
over-expression of pst operon can enhance the total phosphate absorption by improving the cellular phosphate import
over-expression of ppK gene can enhance the total phosphate absorption by improving the cellular phosphate storage
