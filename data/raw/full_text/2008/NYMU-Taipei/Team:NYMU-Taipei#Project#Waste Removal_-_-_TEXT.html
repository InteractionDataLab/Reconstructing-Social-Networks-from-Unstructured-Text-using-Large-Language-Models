About Us
Waste removal is function we want to perform when our BacToKidney enters the small intestine. Waste removal is split into three parts:
Urea -- the removal of urea.
Guanidine -- the removal of guanidine.
Phosphate -- the balancing of phosphate.
The removal efficiency of Urea, Guanidine and Phosphate can be quantitatively characterized by promoter of LacI (pLac, R0010 )
