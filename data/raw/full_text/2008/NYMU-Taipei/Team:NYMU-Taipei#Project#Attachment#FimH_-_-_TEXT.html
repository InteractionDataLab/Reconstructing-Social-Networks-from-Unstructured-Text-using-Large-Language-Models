FimH Binding Domain Structure
FimH can bind to different kind of mannose on human bladder or intestine epitheial cells.
FimH has different variants. Monomannose-specific phenotype is dominant among uropathogenic E. coli while the oligomannose phenotype is most common among fecal E. coli.
heptyl-a-D-mannose prevents binding of type 1-piliated E. coli to the human bladder cell line 5637.
As the figure show, FimH has two domains:
the upper domain is a lectine domain--- the mannose binding site.
the other is a pilin domain---controlling the affinity between FimH and mannose according to different shear strain .
the binding domain is a kind of lectin.It can be devided in three parts:
polar pocket(red part):binds to mannose with hydrogen bond.
tyrosine gate(blue part):binds to mannose with aromatic stacking,van der waals force and hydrophobic contact.
hydrophobic support platform(grey part)
The mannose shows in the figure is Oligomannose-3.
FimH Lectin Binding Domain & mannose interaction
The blue and red parts are FimH amino acid, while black part is oligomannose.
cyan dashes mean hydrogen bond, and red dashes mean aromatic stacking or van der waals force.
from the picture, we can see that Man4 interacts with FimH through polar pocket with hydrogen bond, while Man3,GLcNAc2,GLcNAc1 interact with tyrosine gate by aromatic stacking & van der waals force.
