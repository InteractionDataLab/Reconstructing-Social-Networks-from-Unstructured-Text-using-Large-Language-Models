Transportation Efficiency of PIT and PST system
Characterization of two genetically separable inorganic phosphate transport systems in Escherichia coli, JB 1980 (G R Willsky and M H Malamy)
high affinity-low velocity Pst (phosphate specific transport) system have a Km of 0.43 +/- 0.2 microM Pi and a Vmax of 15.9 +/- 0.3 nmol of Pi (mg [dry weight]-1min-1)
low affinity-high velocity Pit (Pi transport) system have a Km of 38.2 +/- 0.4 microM and a Vmax of 55 +/- 1.9 nmol of Pi (mg [dry weight]-1min-1)
Phosphate Concentrations of normal and CKD patient
Normal adult (0.81 to 1.45 mmol/L)
Chronic Kidney Disease (CDK) patient (1.29 to 2.096 mmol/L)
Disorders of Phosphate Concentration by merck
Simulation of Phosphate Absorption
assume 1g/L (dry weight) therapeutic bacteria in the human intestine
PST system alone can reduce the environmental phosphate from 2000nmol to 100nmol within 2 hours
PIT system alone can reduce the environmental phosphate from 2000nmol to 100nmol within 1 hours
To decrease the illness caused by fast phosphate removal, we prefer to use PST system
