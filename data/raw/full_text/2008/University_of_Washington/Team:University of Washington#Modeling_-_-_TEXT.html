Here is the PDF for the UW iGem Modelling!
Media:ModelingUW.pdf
We would like to thank everyone that made iGem possible, as well as the advisors, professors, and staff that supported our team throughout the run.
Technical notes:
The PDF quality washed up some of the images, if you have trouble seeing them, request a .docx version of the paper from me (email below).
The code for all simulations was done in Mathematica, and I will happily distribute it. Once again, email me!
