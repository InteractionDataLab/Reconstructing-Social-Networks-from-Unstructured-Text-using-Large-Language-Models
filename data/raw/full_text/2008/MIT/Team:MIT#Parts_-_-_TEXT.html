Parts Submitted to the Registry
p1025
This sequence codes for a short peptide, found to competitively inhibit binding of S.mutans to the tooth surface ( CG et al.; Nature Biotechnol. 1999 ). S.mutans takes in sugars and secretes lactic acid, causing dental cavities, so introduction of this peptide into the mouth prevents colonies.  This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Biobrick number: BBa_K128003
pLEM415 plasmid with Biobrick inserts
This is the pLEM415 plasmid, an E.coli shuttle vector and is able to transform Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. lactis.
This piece is under construction
Biobrick Number: BBa_K128007
pJK650 plasmid
This is the pJK650 plasmid, which has the ability to transform Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. lactis.
This piece is under construction
Biobrick Number: BBa_K128008
GFP
Although there are multiple GFP parts in the registry already, this part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
L.bulgaricus signal
This is a short signal sequence recognized as a secretion tag by Lactobacillus strains. It was isolated from the 5' end of the prtB gene in Lactobacillus bulgaricus, which codes for a lactose digesting protein that is bound to the surface ( Germond JE et al.; Appl Environ Microbiol. 2003 ). This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Biobrick number: BBa_K128004
FLAG tag
This is the well-known FLAG tag for use in antibody binding assays.  This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Biobrick Number: BBa_K128000
HA tag
This is the well-known HA tag for use in antibody binding assays. This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Biobrick number: BBa_K128001
His tag
This codes for six Histidine residues to allow for His column protein purification. It will work best if put at either the N or C terminus of your protein construct. This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Biobrick number: BBa_K128005
Tev Cleavage Site
This codes for the seven amino acid sequences that is recognized by the Tobacco Etch Virus protease. The amino acid sequenced used is:
Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly.
The TEV protease cuts between Gln and Gly.  This part uses the modified Silver BioBrick prefix and suffix to allow for protein construction.
Biobrick number: BBa_K128002
L. bulgaricus Native Promoter
This is the native LacS Promoter of the bacteria Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus. It is a LacS promoter taken from genomic DNA. It should include a ribosome binding site also, so no additional RBS is needed. This promoter should be used in experiments that aim to alter the gene function of L. bulgaricus. It is a LacS promoter so should be able to be regulated.
Biobrick Number: BBa_K128006
