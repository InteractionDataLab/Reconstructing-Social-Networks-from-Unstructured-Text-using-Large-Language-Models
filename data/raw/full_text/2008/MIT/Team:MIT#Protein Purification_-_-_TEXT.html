TEV Purification Protocol
These volumes are for 4L LB culture split into 4 cell pellets
Buffers:
Binding Buffer: 20mM tris +.5M NaCl
Elution Buffer: 20mM tris +.5M NaCl + 300mM Imidazol
Re suspend pellets in 30mL BB per cell pellet into centrifuge tube
Lyse cells with sonicator
Sonicate for 1min
Ice for 1min
Repeat 4-5 times
Centrifuge at 14,000 for 40miin
Save supernatant and pellet for gel
Filter supernatant
Prepare 2 NiNTA columns
Add 5mL NiNTA to each
Wash with 1 column volume ddwater
Equilibrate with 4 c.v. BB
Load filtered supernatant
Collect FT
Save some for gel
Wash with 8 c.v. BB
Collect W1-4
Save some of each for a gel
Elute with 5 c.v. EB
Collect E1-5
Save some of each for a gel
Add 1mM EDTA and 1mM DTT to all elution tubes
Run a gel.
Peptide Purification Protocol
First day:
Lysis buffer:
200mL 1x binding buffer
200 mg lysozyme
40 μL 5mM AEBSF
4 enzyme tablets
Thaw frozen cell pellets
Resuspend cells in 30mL lysis buffer.
Sonicate for one minute to homogenize.
Rock at 4C for 2 hrs to lyse
Spin lysate 40min and filter
Put 4mL Ni-NTA into flow tubes, wash w/ water and equilibrate w/ 8mL BB
Load filtered supernatant and collect flow through (FT)
Wash with 16mL BB
collect two washes (W1, W2)
Elute with 16mL EB and collect 4 elutions (E1-4)
Dialyze E1 and E2 into TEV cleavage buffer  overnight
2L –
5mL EDTA
40mL 4M NaCl
100ml tris
Second day:
Add 300 μL tev protease to each
Cleave for two hours at rm temp
Spin down for 10min at 3500rpm
Add 1mL Ni-NTA resion to columns
Wash with water
Equilibriate with 8mL BB
Load supernatant from tev cleavage and collect flow through
Wash with 15mL BB and collect three washes
Elute with 20mL EB and collect two elutions
