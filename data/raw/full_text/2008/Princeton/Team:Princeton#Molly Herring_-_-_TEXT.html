Molly was born and raised in Calvert County, Maryland, and came to Princeton to pursue a degree in the Chemical Engineering Department's Class of 2010. On campus, when not hard at work in the lab (or doing homework), she can be found in Christian fellowship, playing volleyball, or working in the dining hall (yay RoMa!). She is under obligation to save the world. And win a Nobel Prize.
