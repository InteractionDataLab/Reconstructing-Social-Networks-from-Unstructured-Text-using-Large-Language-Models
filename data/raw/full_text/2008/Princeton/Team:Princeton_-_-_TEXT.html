They are a motley crew of accomplished coffee thieves with majors ranging from chemical engineering to economics, which probably explains why they can’t agree upon anything and settle their differences with cold torture.
The goal of the Princeton iGEM team is to utilize the considerable capabilities of neurons and in particular of neuronal networks – in terms of speed of transmission of information, physical and programmable versatility – by designing neural networks using gene-regulatory circuits and microfabrication of surfaces.
