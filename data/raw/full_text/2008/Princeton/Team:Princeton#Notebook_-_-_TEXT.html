The Princeton iGEM team uses a daily wrap-in/ wrap-up format to outline tasks, and report on progress by team, or in some cases, by individual. To see our teams, click here . Each individual task is color coded to demonstrate status. We use the following colors:
To be completed
Completed
Success
Failure
Each protocol performed and experiment conducted has its own entry in a lab notebook reserved for that purpose. Since by the end of the ten weeks, this will amount to a considerable amount of data, the only section of the comprehensive lab notebooks being uploaded here is the daily wrap-ups, which list the tasks completed that day, and those left over for the coming days.

These files do not provide extensive details on each of the protocols followed to construct plasmids, or carry out transfections, for example. Furthermore, the wrapup files from after the summer are not available here, but may be requested.
If you would like information in addition to that given here, or further details on anything specific, please do not hesitate to contact us at igem2008@princeton.edu. We like talking to people. It reminds us we are human, not necessarily destined to be grad students (no offense of course, we love grad students).
