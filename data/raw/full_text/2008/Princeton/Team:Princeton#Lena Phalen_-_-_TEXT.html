Lena's default mood is sarcastic and she invests far too much time and energy making mix tapes and drawing oddly (freakishly?) realistic pictures of people. When asked to describe herself in three words, she says "don't like sushi". She is fluent in several world languages but for legal reasons is not allowed to use that knowledge ever again. She is an All-Around American Champion in Procrastination and hopes to one day compete in the Olympics. In high school she was voted Most Likely to Pick a Major She Loves and Wind Up Living in a Box on Fifth Avenue Making $0.12/hour. But Gosh, She Sure Will Love It.
