Caroline DeHart is starting her second year as a MolBio grad student at Princeton. Before she began her slow conversion to caffeine-powered android, she was a biochemistry major at UMBC for three years, where she learned multiple ways to extract, synthesize, and produce caffeine. Currently, she spends the majority of life in lab, either trying to convince the iGEM students to neither kill each other nor destroy the lab they work in, or to actually make some sort of convincing headway on her current thesis project. She can be found by following the strong coffee smell, the loud music, and occasionally, the sound of her head beating against the wall.
