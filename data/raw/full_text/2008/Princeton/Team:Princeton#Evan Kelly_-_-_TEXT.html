Evan is a Junior Electrical Engineering major at Princeton from Richmond, Virginia. He is a member of the Varsity Swim Team. He enjoys fixed gear bicycles and has poor taste in tea. He would have voted for Dennis Kucinich and America would have been much better for it. His favorite meal is pulled pork sandwiches and sweet tea. Despite his love for food, Evan hates Massimo’s pizza.
Also, he hates Michael Phelps.
