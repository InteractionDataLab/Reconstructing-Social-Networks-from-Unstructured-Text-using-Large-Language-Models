Coding Parts Submitted to the Registry
Ubc promoter
Description: This is a stable constitutive promoter.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076017
Ngn1
Description: This is a transcription factor that promotes the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neuronal precursors.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076002
Mash1
Description: This gene is a cell fate regulator that promotes the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neuronal precursors.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076014
Linker
Description: This short sequence connects the Ngn1 and EYFP gene products, providing a translational fusion. This enables us to detect the location of Ngn1 by tracking the appearance of fluorescent yellow protein within the cell.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076003
2A linker
Description: This is a protein linker sequence that allows one reporter protein, in our case EYFP, to be linked to another, in our case mKate, under certain conditions and cleaved under certain other conditions.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076005
T2A linker
Description: This is a protein linker allowing for translational fusion between two gene products.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076011
P2A linker
Description: This is a protein linker allowing for translational fusion between two gene products.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076012
mKate
Description: This is a red fluorescent reporter protein, found to be more reliable than mCherry or DsRed2.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076006
EYFP
Description: This is an enhanced yellow fluorescent reporter protein.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076004
D5R or DRD5
Description: This gene encodes a specific subunit of a dopamine receptor.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076008
Lbx1
Description: This gene codes for a GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmitter.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076009
GLRA1
Description: This gene codes for an inhibitory glycine receptor.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076010
Bleomycin
Description: This gene is an antibiotic that allows for the selection of cells containing any construct that includes it.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076016
Plasmids Submitted to the Registry
pLV-TRE-Mash1-IRES2-mKate
Description: This plasmid encourages differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neuronal precursors and marks the cells with the red-fluorescent mKate.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076015
pLV-TRE-Ngn1-linker-EYFP-Ubc-Bla
Description: This plasmid only contains the fluorescently-labeled Ngn1, which enables the location of this neuronal transcription factor to be determined within the cell.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076007
pLV-TRE-Ngn1-linker-EYFP-2A-mKate-Ubc-Bla
Description: This plasmid allows rtTA-induced expression of the cell-fate regulator Ngn1 linked to an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) reporter, and a red fluorescent protein (mKate) reporter tethered by a 2A linker. This construct allows for the verification of the 2A linker, with the ideal result of yellow-labeled Ngn1 remaining in the nucleus and red-labeled mKate being exported to the cytoplasm.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076000
pLV-TRE-Sox17-Ubc-Bla
Description: This is the backbone plasmid into which SfiI_Ngn1-linker-EYFP-2A-mKate_SfiI was inserted after digestion with SfiI.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076001
pLV-TRE-D5R-Ubc-Bleo
Description: This plasmid allows bleomycin-selected cells to express the D5R dopamine receptor subunit upon induction with doxycycline.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076018
pLV-TRE-Lbx1-T2A-GLRA1-P2A-D5R-Ubc-Bla
Description: This plasmid allows for the simultaneous production of Lbx1 [produces GABAergic neurons], GLRA1 [produces a specific glycine receptor], and D5R [produced a subunit of a particular dopamine receptor]. This makes the neurons able to respond to both a dopamine and a glycine input, and in turn produce a GABA output.
BioBrick Number: BBa_K076013
