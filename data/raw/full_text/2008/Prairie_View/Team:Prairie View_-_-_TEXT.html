Welcome to Prairie View A&M University's 2008 iGEM wiki page.
The Prairie View team consists of five students and two advisors. We are excited about
competing in the iGEM competition. This year we will design and build an engineering
system using DNA to make biology as predictable as engineering.  This project will help
us to develop new ideas as well as become expertise in our learning fields. We thank
all of those who have committed their time and donations to this breakthrough technology.
