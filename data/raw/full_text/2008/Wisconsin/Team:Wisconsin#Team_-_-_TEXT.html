Team Wisconsin is a diverse team consisting of upper and lower class undergraduates who are working together to do something seriously cool: renewable biofuels.  With backgrounds varying from Mechanical Engineering to Biochemistry, our varied team is exploring new ways to solve old problems using synthetic biology.
We also (generally) love late night romantic trips to movies, long walks, scheming up ways to become wealthy, discussing interesting social interactions, knitting, and having fun... Obviously.
