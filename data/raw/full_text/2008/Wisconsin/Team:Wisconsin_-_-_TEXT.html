The University of Wisconsin - Madison has long been a leader in research, innovation, and education.  With that reputation in mind, we have assembled a diverse team that will take part in the iGEM competition at MIT this fall.  The team is comprised of undergraduate biochemists, geneticists, microbiologists and engineers alike.  Our aim is to gain insight and knowledge in the field of genetic engineering.  We also hope that in the process we will do something no one else has done before.  This year, the Wisconsin iGEM team has selected ambitious projects based on the broad topic of biofuels.  More information on these projects can be found on this site.
