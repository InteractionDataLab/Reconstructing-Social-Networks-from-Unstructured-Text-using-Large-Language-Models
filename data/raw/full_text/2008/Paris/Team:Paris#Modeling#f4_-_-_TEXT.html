Specific Plasmid Characterisation for 4
According to the characterization plasmid (see right) and to our modeling, in the exponential phase of growth, at the steady state,
we have [FlhDC]real = {coefflhDC} 1([aTc]i) and [FliA]real = {coeffliA} 2([arab]i)
but we use [aTc]i = Inv_1( [FlhDC] ) and [arab]i = Inv_2( [FliA] )
So, at steady-states,
we use this analytical expression to determine the parameters :
