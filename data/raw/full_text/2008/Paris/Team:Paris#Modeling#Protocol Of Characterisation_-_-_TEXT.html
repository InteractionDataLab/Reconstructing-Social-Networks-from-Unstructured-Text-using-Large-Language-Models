Principles of the Experiments
To evaluate quantitativly the activity of a promoter in function of its transcription factors, we need datas in which the different values of the activities are correlated with various known and controlled values of the transcription factors concentrations. Therefore, we designed a generic plasmid in which the transcription factors are put under the control of previously characterized inducible promoter, and the studied promoter is put before a fluorescent reporter gene.
Assumptions Specific to the Experiments
The previous experiment is used to find parameters regarding to our modelization. However, the experiments themselves must be described in the same way to involve those parameters in a consistent way, and actually, to be interpreted.
