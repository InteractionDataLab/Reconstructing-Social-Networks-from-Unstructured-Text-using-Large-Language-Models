Ariel Lindner, Biology / Chemistry
Major in Chemistry (Hebrew University, Jerusalem), M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) working on catalytic antibodies as enzyme models. After a research period at the Scripps Institute (California, USA), I currently work in Paris as associate professor at the Medicine faculty of medicine, Paris Descartes university where where applpying Physical, Chemical and Biological approaches to study variability between clonal individual bacterial cells and their aging. As a co-initiator and teacher of the Interdisciplinary Approaches to Life Sciences master program at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity, I try to help students fulfill their talents and thus instruct our students-initiated iGEM team.
Samuel Bottani, Physics
I am a physicist, associate professor at the University Denis Diderot in Paris. I am interested in self-organization, out of equilibrium dynamics, and the logic of cellular computation. My research interests are on structure, dynamics and evolution of regulatory networks. In particular I am interested in the interplay between genome architecture, spatial organization of the cell and dynamical properties of cell functions. Genomic context and architecture possibly determines or optimizes the output of artificial genetic networks. I am very concerned in innovation in university teaching.
Gregory Batt, Computer Science
I'm a research scientist at INRIA.  I work on developing mathematical approaches and computational tools for the analysis of genetic regulatory networks, with applications in systems and synthetic biology. The central question I try to address is how to obtain relevant predictions despite large parameter uncertainties and environmental fluctuations. My work combines modeling in biology, maths and computer science.
