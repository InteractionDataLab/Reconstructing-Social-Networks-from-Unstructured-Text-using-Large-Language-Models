Cellular growth and dilution rate
We denote by c.u the arbitrary (due to normalization) concentration unit.
We evaluated in the wet lab the half life time for our cells, and then calculated the degradation constants using :
The value for half-life time we found and used is 35min ( γ = 0.0198).
Furthermore, Drenewal is a wet-lab data since we can impose the exact value of our wish. What is more, thanks to this model, we are able to evaluate an optimised value of this parameter so as to carry the experiments with the best probability to have the wanted behavior.
∅ occurance in the table corresponds to value we did not need due to our normalization process.
