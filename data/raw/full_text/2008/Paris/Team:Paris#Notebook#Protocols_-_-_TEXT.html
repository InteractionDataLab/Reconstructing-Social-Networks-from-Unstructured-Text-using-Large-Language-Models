Culture of Stable strain with biobricks 2008
Streaks on plates with LB and the adapted antibiotics to isolate colonies
Incubate O/N at 37°C
Take clone with a sterile tip and put in 7.5ml LB with adaptated antibiotics (LB have to be prepared before !!!)
Will be use for Miniprep and Stock in glycerol
2-3 clones isolated by Biobricks
Incubate O/N at 37°C (open just a little the cap for bacteria's breathing)
Don't store LB in the fridge even with antibiotics !
Glycerol Stocks
Remove 2.5mL of each culture and centrifuge.
Discard the supernatant and resuspend pelleted bacteria in 1mL of LB.
Add 500µL of 60% glycerol.
Store at -20°C.
Minipreps (QIAGEN kit)
centrifuge  5mL of culture 8 min at 3,500 to 4,000 g.
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 µl Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 µl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times. If using LyseBlue reagent, solution turns blue.
Add 350 µl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times. If using LyseBlue reagent, solution turns colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
Apply the supernatant (from step 4) to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through.
Recommended: Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through. This step is only required when using endA+ or other bacteria strains with high nuclease activity or carbohydrate content (see QIAprep Miniprep Handbookfor more details)
Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s.
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
To elute DNA, place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 30 µl Buffer EB or pure water to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
Electrophoresis
An electrophoresis can be done to check if there is Product of Miniprep
Gel : 1% agarose with BET added (5 µL BET for 100 mL TBE)
10 µL Quick-Load 1 kb DNA Ladder
2 µL Loading Dye + 3 µL DNA
Concentration of the Miniprep or the Midiprep
By biophotometry
Blank : 60 µL of pure water  or 55 µL of pure water + 5 µL EB
Sample : 55 µL of pure water + 5 µL of sample
Check if the ratio 260/280 is over 1,6
Think about the dilution !
If the concentration is to low, concentrate the sample in a vacuum centrifuge. Don't forget to open the tubes!
Digestion
1 µg of plasmid / 250 ng of PCR product
Buffer (n°2) 10X : 3µL
BSA 100X : 0.3µL
1 µL of each enzyme
Pure water qsp 30 µL
Incubate during about 2h30-3h at 37°C, then 20 minutes at 65°C (to inactivate the enzymes).
Migration after digestion
Run the whole samples (30 µL) in a 1-2% agarose gel with TAE buffer (a new one)
Run at 50 V until halfway
10 µL of ladder 1kb and 100 pb on every side
30 µL of DNA + 6 µL of Loading Dye
Separate each sample by an empty well !
Extraction
For each new extraction it's important to have a new bath of TAE Buffer for the run and of ETB for the revelation
Use UV at lower intensity and for shorter time as possible
Use a new blade for each extraction
The band weight must be less than 400 mg
Antarctic phosphatase
To avoid autoligation, the vector in a construction has to be treated with phosphatase to dephosphorylate the cut end of the plasmid. The Antarctic phosphatase has the advantage to be easily and totally inactivated by heating.
After the digestion reaction add Antarctic phosphatase buffer to a final concentration of 1x
Add 1µL of Antarctic phosphatase for 1 to 5 µg of DNA
Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes and then inactivate the phosphatase at 65°C for 5 min
Do not use this reaction for the insert or the ligation will not work
Amplification of promoters
(to amplify the sequence in order to have enough amount of DNA to carry out the following of our experiments)
Preparation of the templates : Resuspend of 1 colony  in 100µl of water.
Preparation of PCR mix :
For each samples 1 µl dNTP
10 µl Buffer Phusion 5x
2,5 µl Oligo_F
2,5 µl Oligo_R
1µl template
1 µl Phusion
50 µl qsp H2O (33µl)

Protocol to make competent bacteria
1. Use non competent bacteria (ex: MG1655) stocked in 1.5 mL LB (20% Glycerol): put a sterile tip in the 1.5 mL stock tube and then place it in a 50 mL Falcon with 5 ml LB medium. Over Night culture at 37°C / 300 rpm
2. 1/100 dilution in LB medium QSP 50 mL in an erlenmeyer of 250 mL
3. Culture at 37°C / 300 rpm untill OD600 reach 0.6
4. Fast cooling at +4°C by gently shaking the erlen in ice
Before: prepare CaCl2 0.1M.
Add 5,56 g in 500 mL H2O (Gibco)
dissolve the CaCl2 by mixing the suspension with the help of a magnetic stirrer
Filter the solution with a cell-culture unit of filtration
Aliquotes the filtered solution: 25mL in a 50 mL Falcon. Storage at +4°C
5. Use pre-cooled centrifuge at +4°C. Centrifuge 50 mL of the culture in 50 mL falcon: +4°C / 5 min / 5000 rpm
6. Discard supernatant by inverting the tube, and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold CaCl2 and mix gently the suspension by up and down
7. Add cold CaCl2 QSP 20 mL and incubate 30 min / +4°C
8. Centrifuge the suspension : +4°C / 5 min / 5000 rpm
9. Discard supernatant by inverting the tube, and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold CaCl2 and mix gently the suspension by up and down
10. Transform or freeze the competent cells. Freeze the competent cells in 50 µL aliquots in the 0.1M CaCl2 medium with 15% glycerol.
11. After transformation, prepare a Glycerol Stock or/and use the transformed bacteria to study the doubling time of the bacteria population
Study of the doubling time of the bacteria population
Unfreeze strains from the glycerol stock containing or not the plasmid with a contitutive promoter and a fluorescent reporter gene
Put a sterile tip in the 1.5 mL stock tube and then place it in a 50 mL Falcon with 5 ml of minimum medium . Over Night (16h) culture at 37°C / 300 rpm
Measure the OD600 (Linear Zone Measurement <1.5)
Dilute the culture medium in the same new medium to obtain an approximative OD600 of 0.01 (Vfinal= 50 mL in a 250 ml erlenmeyer)
Incubate à 37°C / 300 rpm and measure the OD600 every 20 min
Determine the doubling time population and compare the strains containing or not the plasmid with a contitutive promoter and a fluorescent reporter gene
