Cloning of flagella gene promotors into J61002 plasmid
We have to digest (by EcoRI and SpeI) the PCR products of yesterday (amplification of pFlgA (MP124), pFlgB (MP125), pFlhB (MP126) and pFlhDC (MP127) in order to clone them into the J61002 plasmid (that we must extract and then digest by EcoRI and SpeI).
Plasmid extraction
The J61002 plasmid was extracted from overnight bacteria culture using the QIAspin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) by QIACube.
Number of this plasmid extraction : MP123
Carried out 3 times (3 tubes)
Quantification of DNA
In order to quantify the DNA contained either in the Miniprep product of MP123 or in the PCR products of MP124, MP125, MP126 and MP127 previously purifed yesterday by the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, we carried out :
By electrophoresis
Assay to quantify DNA
10µl of 100pb DNA ladder
5 µL of the sample + 1 µL of 6X blue loading dye
Migration in a 1,5% agarose gel; ~30' at 100W.

==>Results : The MP123 plasmid is clearly visible but the PCR products (purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction) aren't. There might be a problem during the purification step using the QIAquick Gel Extraction. Whatever, we still go on with the digestion.
By Spectrophotometer
Besides the MP123 sample (J61002 plasmid) was quantified using a Bio Photometer (Eppendorf).

==>Conclusion :' we observe a band near 3000 pb, and we excpeted a size of 3002 pb. So we observe the linearise plamsid (only one band at the good size).
Analysis of the purified digested DNA:
gel 2 : D136
Excision, dissolution and purification of the band of interest using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega).
Purification of the digested PCR products using the same kit.

Cloning of pflhDC
Yesterday the isolation of pflhDC did not work : the PCR product measured more than 1.5 kb. We checked the primers, they are well designed but they contain a sequence similarity with other sequences in E.coli K12. To amplify more precisely the promoter, we decided to do a PCR with gradient.
Protocol
10µL Phusion buffer 5X
1µL dNTP
2.5 µL Oligo F ( O111 ) 10mM
2.5 µL Oligo R ( O113 ) 10mM
1µL template DNA
0.5µL Phusion polymerase
PCR Program
PROMOTE2 * LID : 105 °C    *1. T: 95°C     5min    *2. T: 95°C     1min    *3. T: 55°C     30s  ~>G: 5°C    *4. T: 72°C     1min30    *5. GO TO: 2 REP: 29    *6. T: 72°C     5min        *7. HOLD: 10°C
Results
PCR with gradient : amplification of pflhDC
On the left side, the temperature was 50°C, in the center 55°C and on the right 60°C.
We can't see anything on this electrophoresis (except the ladder) !
Remarks :
We forgot the negative control
The temperature should be 60°C +- 5°C
For a promoter, 45s of elongation is enough (~1min per kb)
We could have used a taq polymerase instead of the phusion one
We will do it again
The return of PCRs for amplification of promoters
As our results were not very encouraging, we started again a PCR to amplify:
pflhDC ( 12 times with 12 different temperatures between 55°C and 65°C)
pflgA (60°C)
pflgB (60°C)
pflhB (60°C)
Negative control
Protocol
We used the taq polymerase, following a typical protocol.
Program
The PCR Program was a new version of PROMOTE2 :
PROMOTE2 * LID : 105 °C    *1. T: 95°C     5min    *2. T: 95°C     1min *3. T: 60°C     30s  ~>G: 5°C *4. T: 72°C     45 sec *5. GO TO: 2 REP: 29    *6. T: 72°C     5min        *7. HOLD: 10°C
Results
We will have the results tomorrow
