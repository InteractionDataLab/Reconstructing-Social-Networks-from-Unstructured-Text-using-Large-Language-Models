Impact of simulation methods
This section wil just be made of some simulations to show the influence of the solver used. Indeed, when it comes to detect oscillations, some weird phenomenon can just be produced by simulation algorithms' aterfact. We have just obtained the following curves for the same initial system of ODEs.
Numerical simulations with Euler algorithm
(The second picture is just a zoom, as defined by the red box)
Numerical simulations with variable-step methods
(The second picture is just a zoom, as defined by the red box)
One can notice that some oscillations seem to occur in the second case, which is not the case in simulations made with constant step. Therefore, the precise tuning of the algorithm used have to be undertaken in order to avoid false detection of oscillations.
