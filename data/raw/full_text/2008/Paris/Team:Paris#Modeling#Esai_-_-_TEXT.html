Mathematical Interpretation and Simulation of the Molecular Reactions
First, we consider the complexation phenomenon. We show, under the quasi steady-state hypothesis, how it leads to Non-Linear interactions like "Hill functions".

Quasi Steady-State Hypothesis
Reaction of Complexation
Equilibrium of a "disappearing" Complex
Hill function

Then, we apply these results to the Molecular Reactions of our system. That gives all the theoretical calculation of the complexations, and finally, with the previous assumptions, we get the equations of the full system of ODEs.
Complexation Steady-State
The double triangle (><) is a symbol for complexations :
means n1 molecules of FlhDC complexed with a pFliA promoter
|On the Example :
