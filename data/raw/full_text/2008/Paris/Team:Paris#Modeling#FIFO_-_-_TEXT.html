FIFO
The Circuit
We are know studying the following circuit, the same as the one constituing the Oscillations , but with two more operons, under the induction of flhDC and fliA. The gene FPi codes for the i-th reporter protein we will use in our final system.
We have two alternatives for the promoter before the second : pFlgA or pFlgB. These two alternatives are both studied in what follows.
Biochemical Assumptions
see Oscillations
Every logical gates for synthetising the influence of fliA and flhDC are assumed to be SUM gates.
Resulting Equations
First, we kept the equations of the Oscillations system . Then, we added at the end of the previous document the added equation (beginning page 9), regard to the two more operons.
