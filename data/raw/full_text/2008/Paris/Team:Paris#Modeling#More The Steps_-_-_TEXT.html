Team:Paris/Modeling/More The Steps
From 2008.igem.org
1st step: Introduce the tested promoter:
-Cut Promoter with EcoRI and SpeI -Cut Principal plasmid with EcoRI and XbaI
2nd step: Introduce the 1st tested transcription factor:
-Cut Gene with XbaI and SpeI -Cut Principal plasmid+Promoter with SpeI -Check the right orientation of the 1st gene by PCR with appropiated primers
If wanted…
3rd step: Introduce the 2nd gene into the Accessory plasmid
-Cut Gene with XbaI and SpeI -Cut Accessory Plasmid with XbaI and SpeI -Check the right orientation of the 2nd gene by PCR with appropiated primers4
4th step: Introduce the 2nd gene expression system into the Principal Plasmid:
-Cut Accessory Plasmid+2nd gene with PstI -Cut Principal plasmid+Promoter+1st gene with SpeI -Check the right orientation of the 2nd gene expression system by PCR with appropiated primers
