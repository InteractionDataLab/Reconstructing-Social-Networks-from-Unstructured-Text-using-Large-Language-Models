Synchronized oscillations should be given by the unimodular system.
Core system does not oscillate. How can we enhance it?
We need a 'delay' so we can:
1 add more genes to the circuit
2 use quorum sensing (qs)
we chose quorum sensing that can allowed both 'delay' and population synchonization. two ways to add it:
S4: Inspired from Garcia-Ojalvo: oscillating repressilator + oscillating qs module = synchronized oscillations
S2: it amounts to replace single interaction by more complex interactions: should create delay
we analyze both systems for their capacity to generate oscillations.
S2 seems more promising.
Thus we further analize S2 for its capacity to generate synchrionized oscillations (using different initial concentrations and cell populations variability).
