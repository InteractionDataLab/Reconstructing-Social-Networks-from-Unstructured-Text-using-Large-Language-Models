Glycerol Stocks
1mL of each culture (with 2 clones) has been added to 1mL of 40% glycerol.
For each clone, two glycerol stocks have been done.
Stored at -20°C.

Result of the isolation of colonies
E0240 and pSB3K3
E0240 and pSB3K3 are ok : there is a lot of single colonies
Two colonies are picked for an overnight culture at 37°C, 225 rpm, in order to extract plasmids (MiniPreps)
S120 and S121
S120 and S121 : there is a problem, there is nothing on the plates. We have to check whether those strains are really resistant to Amp.
We checked in the strain library, actually the strains do not carry any resistance cassette. We plated them once again on petri dishes with LB without antibiotics
Preparation of the newly amplified promoters
Electrophoresis of the PCR products made yesterday
Standart PCR to amplify pflgA, pflgB and pflhB(Gel1)
PCR with gradient to amplify pflhDC(Gel2)
Electrophoresis settings
Gel : 1.5 % agar

Results
We have no results for pflhDC, wo don't know yet where is the problem. We will try with other conditions! (yet undetermined)
Concerning pflhB, pflgA and pflgB, the protocol seems to be very operational: we always have great results !
Washing of the PCR products
Kit used : Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System from Promega
Standart protocol except the last step. Instead of eluting with water, we used 30 µL of BE buffer (from Qiagen)
DNA concentration measurement
We used two methods:
With a Spectrophotometer
λ = 260 nm
White: 100µL BE Buffer
Templates : 2 µL DNA + 98 µL BE Buffer

Remarks :
There is a great difference between the two methods : sometimes 1 log !
The electrophoresis of the PCR products showed that pflgB was more concentrated than pflgA and pflhA. As a consequence, we rely on the figures determined by the Biophotometer
Digestion

Conclusion : The digestion of MP123 into D136 worked very well. Tomorrow we will isolate it.     We see nothing on the other digestion. Maybe someone forgot to put the template DNA inside the tube !?      Anyway, we will do the manipulation again tomorrow .
Transformations
Protocol
Use of TOP10 chemically competent cells
Defroze competent cells on ice during 5'
Add 5µl of Ligation products in 50µL of competent bacteria (or 1µL for the positive control puc19)
Incubate 30' on ice
Heat-shock the cells during 30" at 42°C without shaking
Put 2' on ice
Add 250µL of pre-warmed SOC medium (4°C)
Incubate 1h at 37°C under shaking (225rpm)
Spin at 5.000rpm during 30"
Remove 150µL of supernatant
Resuspend the pellet in the 150µL left
Spread on adequate plates
Incubate O/N at 37°C
