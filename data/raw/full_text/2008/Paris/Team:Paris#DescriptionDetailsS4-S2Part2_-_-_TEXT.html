HSL mediated coupled oscillators
HSL mediated simple oscillator
     a) The expression of lasI is under the control of the same promotor that used for FlhDC.
     a) The expression of lasI is regulated by FlhDC and Flia (as in the core system)
     b) The expression of envZ depends on both the activation from FlhDC and Flia (as in the core system) and the concentration of HSL present in the cell.
     b) The expression of envZ depends only on the concentration of HSL present in the cell.
