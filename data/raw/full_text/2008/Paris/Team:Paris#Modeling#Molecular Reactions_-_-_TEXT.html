Implementation
We show here the elementary reactions that served us as basis. They intend to be "exhaustive" in the sense that every step of the system is described. Each of these reactions has to be "mathematically interpreted", in a model which accounts for the observable phenomena, and, in the same time, allows us to well estimate experimentally all the involved parameters.
The system we are studying is the "Core System with three genes of interest" that we can represent in the scheme below (with all alternatives pFlhDC or pTet and TetR or envZ or OmpR*)

The "core systeme"
* Every interactions are modelised by a X function
* The detailed example FP1 = 5([FlhDC],[FliA]) is surrounded in red
Complexation Reactions
The double triangle (><) is a symbol for complexations :
means n1 molecules of FlhDC complexed with a pFliA promoter
↓ Complexation Reactions ↑
On the Example :
How given amounts of FlhDC and FliA would produce FP1 ?
FlhDC and FliA bind to pFliL :
Production Reactions
The double triangle (><) is a symbol for complexations :
means n1 molecules of FlhDC complexed with a pFliA promoter
↓ Production Reactions ↑
On the Example :
How given amounts of FlhDC and FliA would produce FP1 ?
FlhDC><pFliL and FliA><pFliL causes "production" of FP1 :
Degradation/Dilution Reactions
↓ Degradation/Dilution Reactions ↑
On the Example :
How given amounts of FlhDC and FliA would produce FP1 ?
FP1 disappears because of its degradation and dilution :
