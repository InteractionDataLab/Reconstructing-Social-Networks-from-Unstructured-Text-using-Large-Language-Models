Project
Analysis
Construction
Characterization
Perspectives
You have reached to our roadmap, where we indicate our goals and the foreseen schedule. This page is of the utmost importance for the team coordination, since we use it as well as a notebook, where we store the ideas we are liable to have... We thus apologize for the occasional mess...

Roadmap
Aims of the modeling part
First approach proposed
Hill functions
first model + score function
bibliography
findparam
experiments
Second approach
bibliography
equations
results
experiments
Continue the previous model
Synchronization
Estimation of the FIFO processes
Stochastic modeling (Gilespie)
Test of robustness
repressilator
comparison
Enhancing the system
Better FIFO behaviour
Other interactions to increase the robustness
Calendar
July
07/31 - Have a full bibliography ⇒ DONE
August
06/07 - First model of the FIFO temporal order, of the backward control inducing the oscillations ⇒ DONE
08/07 - Model the synchronization between cells, using Biocham
08/15 - Summary about the ODE method, Space introduction into models (AC, Delaunay)
08/22 - Feedback: list missing things (parameters), Optimization, Robustness analysis
September
09/22 - Checkpoint meeting
October
10/15 - Scheduled wiki ending (2 weeks before the real ending to finish details)
10/31 - Official wiki ending (date to be checked)
Notebook
On the previous model
add cells
have a population that changes over time
Parameters robustness (threshold, Pa) (screening)
Gillespie : rebuild the model with this new approach // noise
Quantification of FIFO (see Yann)
Quantification period (influent parameters...)
End the Hill model design
Other ideas
biocham : comparison with adapted repressilator
system to add "random" links for model optimisation (quantification of quality : see that oscillation FIFO and synchronization still occur)
change place of tetR (on flgA...)
see mgs (gillespie or spatialization)
highly rigorous model with mRNA
Evaluation of the qulity of a model (/accuracy concerning the real evolution & / parameters you have to find)
