The University of Waterloo 2008 iGEM Team is an interdisciplinary, undergraduate-run group spanning the Faculties of Science, Mathematics, and Engineering. Our undergraduate members and graduate and faculty advisors bring skills, expertise, and perspectives from a broad range of fields, including Biology, Biochemistry, Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Mathematical Physics.
Genome-free Bacterial Bioproduct Factory:
A plasmid-safe, inducible genome-degradation strain for post-kill gene expression
Code Name: The Headless Chicken Project
Abstract
The aim of our project is to engineer a genome-free, cell-based expression system capable of producing a desired protein or activating a pathway in response to an environmental signal. Genome degradation is achieved using the combined activity of a restriction endonuclease to fragment the genome and an exonuclease to hasten degradation. The gene for the protein of interest will be located in a plasmid lacking recognition sites for the endonuclease, allowing it to remain intact after genome degradation. The plasmid genes will be expressed using the remaining cell resources until they expire. The primary application of this design would be an in situ compound production and delivery system for agricultural, industrial or therapeutic use to continue for a period of time.
