GROUP 3: Short two way stops
Summary for Short Two-Way Stops Group
Date:October 7,2008  Status report by: James  Part no.:BBa_K110012;11;10;13;17  Direct transformation into Biobrick vectors has shown interesting results via analysis with PCR  and cutting with Nsp1. The data is somewhat hard to decipher, but I am working on it... Media:10-4-08 digest of 10;11;13.jpg Media:10-04-08 PCR verification.jpg
Date:September 15,2008  Status report by: James  Part no.:BBa_K110012;11;10;13;17  Part Descriptin: Short one-way stop (BBa_K110012 was found to be a 1-way stop)   Short two way stops 11;13 and sapphire Fluorescent proteins 10 and 17 Summary: PCR was performed on   10;11;13;and 17. Phenol Chloroform extraction; REstriction digetion was thenperformed on   all samples. BBa_K110017 was lost in an accident. For BBa_K110010 DPN1 was added during   Restriction Digest to removed the original Kurt thorn source Plasmid. Cloning into Amp  ressistant IGEM Vectors yielded ~100 colonies per plate. Minipreps and RE digests will be performed on these samples.
Restriction Digestion with EcoRI and PstI was also completed on all fluorescent Proteins   from MiT as well as 5 clones from each attempt at assembly (YFP+12.3, and MFA1+YFP+12.3)  Each Fluorescent Protein had no insert present. However NEB buffer 2 was used and >5 ug of DNA was used.  The Assemblies each showed one clone or more for correct size. Note: Lane 5's faint product  was used to make lane 14's Plasmid DNA, thus lane 14 or MFA1+YFP+12.3 clone 5 looks like half the sex detector. 09-16-08.jpg
Date: August 25, 2008  Status report by: James  Part no.: BBa_K110011 -> BBa_K110013  Part Description: Short Two way Stops  Summary: Sequence files from parts sent for sequencing showed incorrect sequences for 3/4 biobricks sent in. However 1 clone  of BBa_K110012 was correct. That clone was cut and ligated into iGEM vector. A PCR will be tried again for 11-->13, however direct  ligation into iGEM vector will be attempted to evade problems with incomplete products ligating into PGEM-T.  The Two way stop biobrick was then attached to the end of the Fluorescent Protien Venus YFP, using iGEM standard assembly.  This Venus YFP had come from iGEM headquarters, as we as still waiting for sequence verification of our biobricks.  We have yet to run the product on the gel, but the expected band length should be around 900bp.   (700bp Fluorescent Protein + 200bp Two way stop)
Date 8/12/08  Status report by: Raghav and James  Part no.:BBa_K110011 -> BBa_K110013; BBa_K110010;17  Part Description:  Summary:Short two way stops should be sent out for sequencing this week Needed   so much DNA to visualize one band of short two way stop. Sapphire FP progress  has slowed, due to extraneous bands in gel and extraneous sequence from the trace   files. transformations from the biobrick book were tried again with very poor  results... 1 COLONY... POSSIBLY THE BIOBRICK BOOK IS UPSETTING.
Date 8/5/08  Status report by: James  Part no.: BBa_K110011 -> BBa_K110013; BBa_K110010;17  Part Description: Short two way stops; and Sapphire Fluorescent Proteins  Summary: The sequence data from last week, turned out all right both orientations of Sapphire FP should be correct sequences Sequence Data HOORAY!  Last weeks miniprep and digestion yielded no DNA, so this week the minprep was repeated and the  digestion of the prodeuct can be found here RE digest Two way stop digestion 8/05/08
Date 7/29/08  Status report by: James  Part no.: BBa_K110011 -> BBa_K110013; BBa_K110010;17  Part Description: Short two way stops  Summary: Sequencing of BBa_K110010;17 (Sapphire FP) revealed confusing, if not bad  sequences. Sequence Data PCR cloning and transformation was completed sucessfully last week on the Short two way stops  A Miniprep was done and a RE digest will be completed soon (possibly tonight)
Date: 7/22/2008  Status report by: James  Part no.: BBa_K110011 -> BBa_K110013  Part Description: Short two way stops  Summary: RE digestion showed no insert the plasmid of our clones, thus the PCR was done again. Short way stops
