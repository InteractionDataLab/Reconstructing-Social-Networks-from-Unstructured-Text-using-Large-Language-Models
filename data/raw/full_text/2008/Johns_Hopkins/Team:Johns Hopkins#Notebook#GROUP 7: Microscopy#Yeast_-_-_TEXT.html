GROUP 7: Microscopy/Yeast
Milestones   * GFP-expressing yeast have been visualized by microscopy and photographed. The pictures of these can    be found on our poster.  * We have the resources to photograph green, various red, yellow, blue, and violet fluorophores.   * STE3-GFP "sex detector" has been transformed into MATa, MATalpha, and MATa/alpha. Permanent cultures    of these will be banked in the Boeke lab early in the week of November 3rd.  * For micrographs of STE3-GFP "sex detector" cells/colonies, see the poster.
