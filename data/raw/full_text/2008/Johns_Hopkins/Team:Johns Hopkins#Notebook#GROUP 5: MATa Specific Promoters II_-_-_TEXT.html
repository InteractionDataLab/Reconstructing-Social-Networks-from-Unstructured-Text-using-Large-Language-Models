GROUP 5: MATa Specific Promoters II
Summary for MATa Specific Promoters II Group
Part Description: Ste2 Promoter Reverse  Summary here: We were able to grow colonies with sequence verified Ste2 promoters.     The promoter is currently located in a glycerol stock in pGEM vector. One attempt to     transfer to the iGEM vector has been made, unsuccessfully. This was due to a mistake     in protocol however, so final transfer to the iGEM vector should still be straightforward.     Progress on this bio-brick has been paused in order to focus on MFA1, which is more     applicable to our project design because this Ste2 designed for the wrong direction.    Part no.: BBa_K110015  Part Description: MFA1 Promoter Forward  Summary here: We have been unable to get successful, sequence verified clones with     our MFA1 promoter thus far. We currently have a few samples of DNA ready to be tested     by restriction enzyme digest, and then, hopefully, sequencing.

Up to today...  Since then -- we have been troubleshooting and working on getting higher concentrations and using  the correct stock plates. Several delays have occurred,and we should be close to ligating into the  iGEM vector from the pGEM vector for Ste2 promoter. Glycerol stocks of the Ste2 are currently available.     Verification of clones of the MFA1 promoter are still in progress.    Status Report by: Alexandra McMillan
8/24   Restriction Enzyme Digested and the insert appears promising. Ready for sequence submission for Ste 2 promotor.
8/21   Due to low concentrations, we needed to concentrate our DNA before preceeding.   Ethanol precipitation using EtOH/NaAc and 100 ul of miniprep mix was complete of the BBa_K110015   and BBa_K11009 minipreps.
8/18  Miniprep products were < 100 ng/ul. Restriction digest. There appear to be correct  size inserts. Gel image coming. Results look promising.
8/15  DNA miniprep of BBa_K110015 and BBa_K11009 cultures
8/13  Incubated inoculations of old colony plates for approximately 12 hours.
By 7/19/08  We successfuly transformed both BB 15 and 9 and ran a gel that came out with faint bands.   We digested BBa_K110015 and BBa_K11009.
Date: 7/11/08  status report by Rick Carrick  Part no.: BBa_K110015,  Part Description: MFA1  Part Location (in build a genome lab):  PCR successful?; Y (on moodle somewhere)  Cloning of PCR product successful: Y  Sequencing of cloned PCR product successful:N  Joining of validated part to adjacent part(s) status: Not done  Problems to be solved: None so far  Current status of this part: This parts must be restriction enzyme digested and sequenced   next.
