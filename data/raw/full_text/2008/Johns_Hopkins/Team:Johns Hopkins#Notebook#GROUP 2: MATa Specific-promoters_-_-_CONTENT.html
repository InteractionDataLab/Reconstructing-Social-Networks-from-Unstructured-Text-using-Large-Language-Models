 Part no.: BBa_K110008 -&gt; BBa_K110016
 Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively.
 Since the restriction digestions have been unclear as to whether or not the ligation
 of MFA1 and STE2 into the Cam BioBrick vector was successful, another transformation was done
 into the Cam Biobrick vector, restriction digestions on the previous mini prep from the 1st
 transformation and 2nd transformation completed, as well as PCR on the mini preps using the
 corresponding primers for BBa_K11008 and BBa_K110016. In the gel: after the 2 log ladder, the
 next for lanes have the restriction digestion products (approx 500 ng of plasmid each) and the
 second four lanes are pcr products in the following order: 08 (1st cam transformation) 16 (1st
 cam transformation) 08 (2nd transformation) 16 (2nd transformation) for both the restriction
 digestion and the pcr. The final lane was a control used in the pcr, unrelated to the project.

 The restriction digestion did not show the insert, while pcr showed a band of the expected size
 in two of the four samples.

 Part no.: BBa_K110008 -&gt; BBa_K110016
 Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively.
 Transformation into a Cam BioBrick was completed, and the restriction digestion of
 the Biobricks from the pGEM vector were checked, comparing the inserts intended to be ligated to
 the Kan Biobrick vector and the inserts intended to be ligated to the Cam Biobrick vector;
 notice that the old inserts are either too faint to see or are not there:

 Lanes: 1 (2-log ladder), 2 BBa_K110008 old, 3 BBa_K110016 old, 4 BBa_K110008 new, 5 BBa_K110016
 new, 6 (2-log ladder)
 A restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI was done to check for the insert after ligated and
 transformed with the Cam Biobrick vector: <A href="/wiki/images/f/fd/090308digest08_16cam.jpg" class="internal" title="090308digest08 16cam.jpg">090308digest08_16_cam</A>

 Part no.: BBa_K110008 -&gt; BBa_K110016
 Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively. 
 Sequences were analyzed. BBa_K110016 had a perfect clone. Since there is not much miniprep left,
 a transformation was done to generate more clones with the correct sequence. BBa_K110008 had one
 mutation. Another transformation into a Kan BioBrick vector was attempted but was unsuccessful.

 Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively.
 <B>Sequences were analyzed. BBa_K110016 had a perfect clone. Since there is not much
 miniprep left, a transformation will be done to generate more clones with the 
 correct sequence. BBa_K110008 had one mutation; additional minipreps from other clones
 are ready to send off for sequencing, although the DNA concentrations are low. Colonies
 can be picked and overnight cultures grown
 for another round of minipreps.</B></PRE><PRE> Date: July 29, 2008
