 Status report by: Tejas
 Part no.: BBa_K110017 -&gt; BBa_K110023
 Part Description: yESapphire , mCherry, venusYFP, and Citrine 
 Work on YFP has progressed, though the biobrick system is giving diffiulty in obtaining a useful
 construct. Moreover, the YFP sequence may not fully match the expected sequence. However,
 fluoroescent proteins (yeast optimized) sent us as STABS from MIT are showing promise, and may be
 ready for some use by the Jamboree date if all goes well. Work will continue on venus YFP and
 mCherry (though mCherry unfortunately contains a restriction site). Sapphire must be started over
 sue to technical difficulties getting a clone.

 Part Description: yESapphire , mCherry, venusYFP, and Citrine 
 Work on yESapphire was gratiously done by James. Primers were designed. Restriction site 
 ends have been added through PCR. The product was cloned into JM109. Colonies were picked
 and an inoculation was grown. Miniprep was performed and subsequent DNA was CS PCR'd 
 and run on a gel to verify contents.
 <B>(<A href="http://www.jhu.edu/iGEM/Group3:ShortTwo-wayStops/2008-7-22.Short%202Way%20Stop,%20Alpha%20Promoters,%20&amp;%20Sapphire%20FP.Allison%20Suarez%20and%20Nate%20Sotuyo%20.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Short 2Way Stop, Alpha Promoters, &amp; Sapphire FP</A>)</B> BioBrick is currently being sequenced. 
 Work on mCherry and venusYFP (BBa_K110018 -&gt; BBa_K110021) is currently being done. Primers were designed.
 Restriction sites have been added through PCR.  (<A href="http://www.jhu.edu/iGEM/Group1:FluorescentProteins/2008-7-23.PCR%20Products:%20mCherry%20and%20Venus%20YFP,%20both%20RtL%20and%20LtR.Ingrid,%20Tejas.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PCR Products: mCherry and Venus YFP, both RtL and LtR</A>) The
 products were cloned into JM109 and plated. 3 colonies per 4 BioBricks (total 12) were picked, grown out,
 mini prepped, and digested for verification on a gel.
 According to the results, (<B><A href="http://www.jhu.edu/iGEM/Group1:FluorescentProteins/2008-7-22.Venus%20YFP%20and%20mCherry%20Miniprep%20check%20via%20digest.Ingrid.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Venus YFP and mCherry Miniprep check via digest</A></B>) , only one of the mCherry's
 (BBa_K110019) is the correct product. A second Digest was preformed to check this, meanwhile new colonies
 have been picked on 7.22.2008 and are being grown out for a higher yield of DNA so that it can be sent off
 for sequencing. <B><A href="http://www.jhu.edu/iGEM/Group1:FluorescentProteins/2008-7-23.Re-Digest%20of%20three%20samples%20of%20mCherry%20BBa_K110018.Ingrid%20.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Re-Digest of three samples of mCherry BBa_K110018</A></B>
 Work on Citrine has not yet begun. Primers have been designed and ordered, but template DNA must be grown out.
 Template DNA will be grown and extracted by James should we later decide that Citrine will be needed.  
 *Note that mCherry and Citrine both have restriction sites within the coding region, and are therefore not
 optimal. Advice/help on this issue would be appreciated.

 Used digest protocol. Sequences have been made, YFP and mCherry have mutations. 
 mCHerry mutations seem deleterious =  discontinued use. 
 YFP mutations are not essential and therefore the RtL 
 Venus YFP will be ligated into final vector product!
