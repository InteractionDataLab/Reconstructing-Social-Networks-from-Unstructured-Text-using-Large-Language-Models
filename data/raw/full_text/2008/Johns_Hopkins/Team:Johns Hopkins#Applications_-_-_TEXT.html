Population dynamics The gist of the MatLab program is to define an initial population of yeast, run the program, and see how that population of yeast has changed as a result of interactions among the yeast. We have several different types of actions defined such as shmoo formation, pheromone production, pheromone decay, pheromone diffusion, mitosis, brownian motion, etc. A random number is generated to determine which action occurs. The probability of an action occurring depends on the rate of the action. Higher rate means it occurs more often. If we don't expect a lot of something to happen, then the rate can be very small.
