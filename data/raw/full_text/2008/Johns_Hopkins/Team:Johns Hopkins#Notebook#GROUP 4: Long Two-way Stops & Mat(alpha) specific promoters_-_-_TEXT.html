GROUP 4: Long Two-Way Stops & MAT(alpha) Specific Promoters
Summary for Long Two-Way Stops & MAT(alpha) Specific Promoters Group
Summary: As of September 23rd, 2008  We had successfully cloned BBa_K110005 and BBa_K110006 (alpha Promoters) and   BBa_K110003 (Long Terminator) into pGEM-T and Kanamycin biobrick vectors.    They await assembly and ligation.
Date: September 17th, 2008  Minipreps were made of the kanamycin biobrick vector clones, and digested with E/P to   check for insert of correct size.  Gel photograph: Alpha Promoters and Long Terminator Digest, Kan BBV Gel Annotations: Alpha Promoter and Long Terminator Digest in Kan BBV Low-copy origin makes for poor gel visualization.  Suggest some other diagnostic test.    Date: September 12th, 2008  Clones were digested with E/P, and ligated O/N into Kanamycin biobrick vector (pSB4K5).  Colonies were picked and grown.
Date: August 26th, 2008  Author: Jonathan  Sequences were returned, and prefix/suffix/identities were confirmed.  Clones that passed are:  Long Terminator BBa_K110003: Clone A1-3.2  Alpha Promoter  BBa_K110005: Clone 5.1  Alpha Promoter  BBa_K110006: Clones 6.1, 6.3
Date: August 21st, 2008  Author: Jonathan  Clones were grown up O/N and re-miniprepped.  Digestion with E/P yielded some possible candidates.  Gel photo: Alpha Promoters and Long Terminators, Digestion from pGEM-T Gel annotations: Alpha Promoter and Long Terminator Digest, pGEM-T vectors Clones submitted for sequencing.
Date: August 1st, 2008  Author: Jonathan  Sequences were submitted to the facility (3/building block) and a few returned perfect clones, but   due to miscommunication, exactly which clones that the trace files correspond to are under some   confusion.  Will attempt to confirm clone identities.
Date: July 29, 2008  Status report by: Jaime  Part no.: BBa_K110001, BBa_K110003, BBa_K110005, BBa_K110006  Part Description: Long Two-way Stops & Mat(alpha) specific promotors Restriction Enzyme Digest of Mini-Preps Summary here:  Need to be sequenced.
