 We had successfully cloned BBa_K110005 and BBa_K110006 (alpha Promoters) and 
 BBa_K110003 (Long Terminator) into pGEM-T and Kanamycin biobrick vectors.  
 They await assembly and ligation.
</PRE><PRE> Date: September 17th, 2008
 Minipreps were made of the kanamycin biobrick vector clones, and digested with E/P to 
 check for insert of correct size.  See gel: /pic//
 Low-copy origin makes for poor gel visualization.  Suggest some other diagnostic test.
 
 Date: September 12th, 2008
 Clones were digested with E/P, and ligated O/N into Kanamycin biobrick vector (pSB4K5).
 Colonies were picked and grown.

 Author: Jonathan
 Sequences were returned, and prefix/suffix/identities were confirmed.  Clones that passed are:
 Long Terminator BBa_K110003: Clone A1-3.2
 Alpha Promoter  BBa_K110005: Clone 5.1
 Alpha Promoter  BBa_K110006: Clones 6.1, 6.3  
</PRE><PRE> Date: August 21st, 2008
 Author: Jonathan
 Clones were grown up O/N and re-miniprepped.  Digestion with E/P yielded some possible candidates.

 Clones submitted for sequencing.

 Author: Jonathan
 Sequences were submitted to the facility (3/building block) and a few returned perfect clones, but 
 due to miscommunication, exactly which clones that the trace files correspond to are under some 
 confusion.  Will attempt to confirm clone identities.
