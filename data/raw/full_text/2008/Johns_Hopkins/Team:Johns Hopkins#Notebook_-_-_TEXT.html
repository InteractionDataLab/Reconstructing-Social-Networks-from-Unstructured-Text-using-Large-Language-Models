Data
To upload data, go here , click on upload data , and provide the necessary information and results.
How to submit data:
1. log-in as you once had to from the www.jhu.edu/iGEM website "login"
User: ****** etc...
Pass: ***** etc...
2. click on UPLOAD DATA from the 'x-files page'
3. add data etc.... and click submit: This generates a webpage and the URL to it is linked in the page you are directed to after you press submit. Copy that URL and past it into the wiki or into the web-browser url box to see what it looks like.
\* If you find that the picture you are uploading is not showing up e-mail Tejas.
Alternatively, you can also just upload files directly to the iGEM wiki. Either way is fine.
Status Reports
The status reports of each group below were continuously updated as we worked on the biobricks.
Click on the name of each group to find past status reports throughout the sex detector project.
To learn more about each biobrick, please refer to the Biobrick page.
GROUP 1: Fluorescent Proteins
Summary for Fluorescent Proteins Group
Venus YFP (BBa_K110021) was able to be constructed and sequence verified(with one possible  mutation), however due to being unable to RE digest the insert out of the biobrick  vector, possibly due to contamination,  the part was not sumbittied to the registry... yet.  We will submit it after it is verified, after the competition.    To see info about this biobrick check out oru patrs: http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2008&group=Johns_Hopkins
GROUP 2: MATa Specific-promoters
Summary for MATa Specific Promoters Group
We were able to produce sequence-verified clones of BBa_K110008 and BBa_K110016: http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2008&group=Johns_Hopkins .
GROUP 3: Short Two-Way Stops
We were able to produce a truncated two-way terminator (thus a one way)   from the STE2 gene - BBa_K110012. Please see Link for information: http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2008&group=Johns_Hopkins
GROUP 4: Long Two-Way Stops & MAT(alpha) Specific Promoters
Summary for Long Two-Way Stops & MAT(alpha) Specific Promoters Group
We were able to produce BBa_K110005 and BBa_K110006 (alpha Promoters) in iGEM vectors.  Also BBa_K110003 was able to be produced and sequence verified. Check out these parts here http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2008&group=Johns_Hopkins
GROUP 5: MATa Specific Promoters II
Summary for MATa Specific Promoters II Group
Part Description: Ste2 Promoter Reverse  Summary here: We were able to grow colonies with sequence verified Ste2 promoters.     The promoter is currently located in a glycerol stock in pGEM vector. One attempt to     transfer to the iGEM vector has been made, unsuccessfully. This was due to a mistake     in protocol however, so final transfer to the iGEM vector should still be straightforward.     Progress on this bio-brick has been paused in order to focus on MFA1, which is more     applicable to our project design because this Ste2 designed for the wrong direction.    Part no.: BBa_K110015  Part Description: MFA1 Promoter Forward  Summary here: We have been unable to get successful, sequence verified clones with     our MFA1 promoter thus far. We currently have a few samples of DNA ready to be tested     by restriction enzyme digest, and then, hopefully, sequencing.

GROUP 6: Vectors
Summary for Vectors Group
Date: July 31, 2008  Status report by: Tejas  Part no.: BBa_K1100XX -> BBa_K1100YY  Part Description: Vectors for concatenating and executing BioBricks    The vectors to be used were delivered to us in STABS from MIT. They are pSB4A5 (amp), pSB4C5  (cam), pSB3K5 (kan), and pSB4K5 (kan). The vectors come pre-inserted with the ccdB gene,  preventing growth in all E. coli strains except DB3.1. Total amount of DNA extracted from mini  -prep is estimated between 5 to 20 ug per vector. Restriction digests confirmed the extracted  DNA was vectors.( Digestion of all four vectors ).  Vectors were transformed into JM109, BB#2198 (DB3.1), and BB#5777 (DB3.1). All gave expected  results. 1 ug of each vector was digested for future use. Gel of digestion shows DNA is correct. ( Vectors ready for insertions )
GROUP 7: Microscopy/Yeast
Summary for Microscopy/Yeast Group
Date: Oct 27, 2008  Status report by: Tejas  Part no.: no Biobrick part  Part Description: Yeast vector pRS414 to be temporarily used.    The yeast vector pRS414 will be temporarily used until it can be adjusted to meet registry   standards. pRS414 contains one EcoRI site and one PstI site, both directly adjacent to each   other. This may make digest a little less efficient. Procedure involves first digesting with   Pst1 for one hour, then digesting with EcoRI overnight (sequentially, not simultaneously), as   EcoRI can tolerate low overhangs better than PstI, according to the NEB catalog. The following   is a gel run on an E/P simultaneous digest of pRS414.  Lane one is log 2 ladder. Lane 2 is uncut pRS414 (supercoiled so runs fater). Lane 3 is cut   vector. It may have only one cut, with half at EcoRI and half at PstI, depending on efficiency of   the second cut occuring after the first.
pRS414 digest
GROUP 8: Assembly Progress
Summary of Biobrick Assemblies:
Planned Schedule for Further Work:
October 31st- Successful transformants from either set of ligations (of Promoter + Fluorescent   Protein) and transformations will be grown up for Miniprep.
November 1st- These pieces will be miniprepped and digested.  Digested fragments will be ligated   together with the terminator in the middle, into a pRS414 yeast/bacterial shuttle vector.    Non-digested fragments of a promoter + fluorescent protein will also individually be transformed   into yeast, with hopes that they will fluoresce.
November 3rd- Full construct insert will be transformed into yeast, pending identity verification.
November 6th- Pretty Yeast! (Hopefully).
