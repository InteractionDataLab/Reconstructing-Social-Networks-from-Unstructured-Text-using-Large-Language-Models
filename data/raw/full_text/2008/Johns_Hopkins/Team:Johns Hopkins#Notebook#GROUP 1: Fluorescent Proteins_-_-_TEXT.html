GROUP 1: Fluorescent Proteins
Date: Oct 19, 2008  Status report by: Tejas  Part no.: BBa_K110017 -> BBa_K110023  Part Description: yESapphire , mCherry, venusYFP, and Citrine
Work on YFP has progressed, though the biobrick system is giving diffiulty in obtaining a useful  construct. Moreover, the YFP sequence may not fully match the expected sequence. However,  fluoroescent proteins (yeast optimized) sent us as STABS from MIT are showing promise, and may be  ready for some use by the Jamboree date if all goes well. Work will continue on venus YFP and  mCherry (though mCherry unfortunately contains a restriction site). Sapphire must be started over  sue to technical difficulties getting a clone.
Date: July 22, 2008  Status report by: Tejas, Ingrid  Part no.: BBa_K110017 -> BBa_K110023  Part Description: yESapphire , mCherry, venusYFP, and Citrine
Work on yESapphire was gratiously done by James. Primers were designed. Restriction site   ends have been added through PCR. The product was cloned into JM109. Colonies were picked  and an inoculation was grown. Miniprep was performed and subsequent DNA was CS PCR'd   and run on a gel to verify contents. ( Short 2Way Stop, Alpha Promoters, & Sapphire FP ) BioBrick is currently being sequenced.
Work on mCherry and venusYFP (BBa_K110018 -> BBa_K110021) is currently being done. Primers were designed.  Restriction sites have been added through PCR.  ( PCR Products: mCherry and Venus YFP, both RtL and LtR ) The  products were cloned into JM109 and plated. 3 colonies per 4 BioBricks (total 12) were picked, grown out,  mini prepped, and digested for verification on a gel.
According to the results, ( Venus YFP and mCherry Miniprep check via digest ) , only one of the mCherry's  (BBa_K110019) is the correct product. A second Digest was preformed to check this, meanwhile new colonies  have been picked on 7.22.2008 and are being grown out for a higher yield of DNA so that it can be sent off  for sequencing. Re-Digest of three samples of mCherry BBa_K110018
Work on Citrine has not yet begun. Primers have been designed and ordered, but template DNA must be grown out.  Template DNA will be grown and extracted by James should we later decide that Citrine will be needed.
*Note that mCherry and Citrine both have restriction sites within the coding region, and are therefore not  optimal. Advice/help on this issue would be appreciated.
Another Digest was done mCherry and YFP Digest Gel and weird lines exist.

Date: July 1 2008  status report by: Ingrid (work done by James)  Part no.: BBa_K110017  Part Description: yESapphire   Part Location (in build a genome lab): In James and Jasper's PCR product Box,  Stainless Steel 4 degree  PCR successful?; Yes  Cloning of PCR product successful: Y/N  Sequencing of cloned PCR product successful: Not done  Joining of validated part to adjacent part(s) status: Not done  Current status of this part: This part is being Sequenced
Date: August 27 2008  status report by: Ingrid   Part no.: BBa_K110018, 19, 20, 21  Part Description: mCherry, YFP    Part Location (in build a genome lab): In James and Jasper's PCR product Box,  Stainless Steel 4 degree  PCR successful?; Yes  Cloning of PCR product successful: Y/N  Sequencing of cloned PCR product successful: Successful for YFP LtR and RtL  Joining of validated part to adjacent part(s) status: In progress  Current status of this part: Ligation into vector  Digest of colonies repicked from mCherry and YFP
Aug 29, 2008  Lane 1: 18.1 mCherry LtR  Lane 2: 18.2 mCherry LtR  Lane 3: 19.1 mCherry RtL  Lane 4: 20.1 Venus YFP LtR  Lane 5: 20.2 Venus YFP LtR  Lane 6: 21.1 Venus YFP RtL  Lane 7: 21.2 Venus YFP RtL  Lane 8: Ladder  Used digest protocol. Sequences have been made, YFP and mCherry have mutations.   mCHerry mutations seem deleterious =  discontinued use.   YFP mutations are not essential and therefore the RtL   Venus YFP will be ligated into final vector product!
