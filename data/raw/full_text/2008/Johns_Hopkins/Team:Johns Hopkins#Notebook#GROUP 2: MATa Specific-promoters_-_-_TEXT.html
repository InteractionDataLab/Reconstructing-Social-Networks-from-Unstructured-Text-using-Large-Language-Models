GROUP 2: MATa Specific-promoters
Date: September 7, 2008  Status report by: Allison and Nate  Part no.: BBa_K110008 -> BBa_K110016  Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively.  Since the restriction digestions have been unclear as to whether or not the ligation  of MFA1 and STE2 into the Cam BioBrick vector was successful, another transformation was done  into the Cam Biobrick vector, restriction digestions on the previous mini prep from the 1st  transformation and 2nd transformation completed, as well as PCR on the mini preps using the  corresponding primers for BBa_K11008 and BBa_K110016. In the gel: after the 2 log ladder, the  next for lanes have the restriction digestion products (approx 500 ng of plasmid each) and the  second four lanes are pcr products in the following order: 08 (1st cam transformation) 16 (1st  cam transformation) 08 (2nd transformation) 16 (2nd transformation) for both the restriction  digestion and the pcr. The final lane was a control used in the pcr, unrelated to the project. 090708digestpcr0816 The restriction digestion did not show the insert, while pcr showed a band of the expected size  in two of the four samples.
Date: September 2, 2008  Status report by: Allison and Nate  Part no.: BBa_K110008 -> BBa_K110016  Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively.  Transformation into a Cam BioBrick was completed, and the restriction digestion of  the Biobricks from the pGEM vector were checked, comparing the inserts intended to be ligated to  the Kan Biobrick vector and the inserts intended to be ligated to the Cam Biobrick vector;  notice that the old inserts are either too faint to see or are not there: lanes2thru5OldDigest0816NewDigest0816 Lanes: 1 (2-log ladder), 2 BBa_K110008 old, 3 BBa_K110016 old, 4 BBa_K110008 new, 5 BBa_K110016  new, 6 (2-log ladder)  A restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI was done to check for the insert after ligated and  transformed with the Cam Biobrick vector: 090308digest08_16_cam Lanes: 1 (old aliquot of 2-log ladder), 2 (new aliquot of 2-log ladder), 3 skip, 4 BBa_K110008,  5 skip, 6 BBa_K110016.
Date: August 19, 2008  Status report by: Allison and Nate  Part no.: BBa_K110008 -> BBa_K110016  Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively.   Sequences were analyzed. BBa_K110016 had a perfect clone. Since there is not much miniprep left,  a transformation was done to generate more clones with the correct sequence. BBa_K110008 had one  mutation. Another transformation into a Kan BioBrick vector was attempted but was unsuccessful.
Date: August 12, 2008  Status report by: Allison and Nate  Part no.: BBa_K11008 -> BBa_K110016  Part Description: A promoters MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L) Two more minipreps were completed. DNA concentrations were much higher (>150 ng/ul).
Date: August 5, 2008  Status report by: Allison and Nate  Part no.: BBa_K110008 -> BBa_K110016  Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively. Sequences were analyzed. BBa_K110016 had a perfect clone. Since there is not much  miniprep left, a transformation will be done to generate more clones with the   correct sequence. BBa_K110008 had one mutation; additional minipreps from other clones  are ready to send off for sequencing, although the DNA concentrations are low. Colonies  can be picked and overnight cultures grown  for another round of minipreps.
Date: July 29, 2008  Status report by: Allison and Nate  Part no.: BBa_K110008 -> BBa_K110016  Part Description: A promoters: MFA1 (L+R) and Ste2 (R+L), respectively. Two samples of mini preps from MFA1 and Ste2 were sent off for sequencing at the end of last week.  Results will follow soon.
