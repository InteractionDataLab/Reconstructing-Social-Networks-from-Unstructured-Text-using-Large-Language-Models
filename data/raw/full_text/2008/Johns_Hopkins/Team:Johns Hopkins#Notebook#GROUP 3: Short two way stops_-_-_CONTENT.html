 Direct transformation into Biobrick vectors has shown interesting results via analysis with PCR
 and cutting with Nsp1. The data is somewhat hard to decipher, but I am working on it...

 Part Descriptin: Short one-way stop (BBa_K110012 was found to be a 1-way stop) 
 Short two way stops 11;13 and sapphire Fluorescent proteins 10 and 17 Summary: PCR was performed on 
 10;11;13;and 17. Phenol Chloroform extraction; REstriction digetion was thenperformed on 
 all samples. BBa_K110017 was lost in an accident. For BBa_K110010 DPN1 was added during 
 Restriction Digest to removed the original Kurt thorn source Plasmid. Cloning into Amp
 ressistant IGEM Vectors yielded <B>~100 colonies per plate.</B>
 Minipreps and RE digests will be performed on these samples.</PRE><PRE> Restriction Digestion with EcoRI and PstI was also completed on all fluorescent Proteins 
 from MiT as well as 5 clones from each attempt at assembly (YFP+12.3, and MFA1+YFP+12.3)
 Each Fluorescent Protein had no insert present. However NEB buffer 2 was used and &gt;5 ug of DNA was used.
 The Assemblies each showed one clone or more for correct size. Note: Lane 5's faint product
 was used to make lane 14's Plasmid DNA, thus lane 14 or MFA1+YFP+12.3 clone 5 looks like half the sex detector.

 Part no.: BBa_K110011 -&gt; BBa_K110013
 Part Description: Short Two way Stops
 Summary: Sequence files from parts sent for sequencing showed incorrect sequences for 3/4 biobricks sent in. However 1 clone
 of BBa_K110012 was correct. That clone was cut and ligated into iGEM vector. A PCR will be tried again for 11--&gt;13, however direct
 ligation into iGEM vector will be attempted to evade problems with incomplete products ligating into PGEM-T.
 The Two way stop biobrick was then attached to the end of the Fluorescent Protien Venus YFP, using iGEM standard assembly.
 This Venus YFP had come from iGEM headquarters, as we as still waiting for sequence verification of our biobricks.
 We have yet to run the product on the gel, but the expected band length should be around 900bp. 
 (700bp Fluorescent Protein + 200bp Two way stop)
