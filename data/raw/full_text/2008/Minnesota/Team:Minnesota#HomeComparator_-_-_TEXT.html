Minnesota's 2008 iGEM Teams
The University of Minnesota is sending their first team to the iGEM competition this year. Our group is composed of two subgroups: Team Comparator and Team Timebomb, each of which is working on an individual project. Team Time Bomb is working to engineer a bacterial time bomb, based on which bacterial cells will 'commit suicide' after a predetermined number of divisions has been reached. Team Comparator is engineering a bacterial comparator, which is one element of a feedback controller. Team Comparator is also developing two computational tools: the SynBioSS Designer and the SynBioSS Wiki.
