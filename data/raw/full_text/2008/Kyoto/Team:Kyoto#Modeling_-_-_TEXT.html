Calculation
Easy approximation calculation
We assume that...
The inside of the hull is jam-packed with E.coli.
The lower surface of the hull is totally covered with E.coli.
Individual thrusts do not interfere each other.
The weight of the Titanic in water = 4.0 × 108 N
Volume of the Titanic = 9.7 × 104 m3
Thrust by the total flagellum (thrust per one flagella = 0.29 pN)  2.5 × 103 N
Buoyancy by the total gas vesicle  (buoyancy per one gas vesicle = fgas pN)  fgas × Vtitanic / VE.coli = fgas × 9.7 × 1022 N
The Titanic floats when fgas is more than 4.1 × 10-3 pN !!
Further simplification
It is assumed that the ship floats when filled with the same volume water as that of its underwater part.
