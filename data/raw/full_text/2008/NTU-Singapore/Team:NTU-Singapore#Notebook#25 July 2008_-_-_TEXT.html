Miniprep 23 tubes of bacteria, E7-ter, Lysis Terminator, lysis, lsrA respectively.
Digestion of E7-terminator, lysis Terminator, Lysis Standard Vector, LsrA standard vector.
Heat inactivation at 80 celcius in thermal cycler before gel run.
Run Gel Check
E7 showed a 2k Band, however, this is not conclusive as GFP vector and E7 Is of the same size.
Lysis standard vector is successful, showed a band between 100bp and 200bp(140bp) LsrA standard vector failed. Lysis Terminator was kept in the fridge for saturday gel run due to time constraits i had on friday.
PCR verification of E7 terminator. Ran PCR with different constituents.
Old E7 Primers, New E7 primers, E7 verification primers.
Results seen on saturday morning.
