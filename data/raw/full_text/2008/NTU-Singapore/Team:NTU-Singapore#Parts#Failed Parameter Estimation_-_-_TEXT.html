Introduction
Transcription of GFP gene mRNA
[MC]:
E7 mRNA Concentration
k1C:
kinetic constant of transcription
a :
constitutive portion , 0<a<1
KC:
Hill constant
nC:
Hill coefficient
d1C:
degradation constant for mRNA
Translation of GFP Protein
[PC] :
Protein concentration
k2C :
kinetic constant of translation
d2C :
degradation constant for Protein
Above shown are the parameters of interest in this estiamtion exercise
Parameter estimation of the constants in the transcription and translation of the GFP protein was performed using the RFU results obtained. The estimations were done using Simulink Parameter Estimation . The approach was overly simplistic but done to get a feel of how the parameters would respond.
Parameter Estimation Results
Parameter Estimation Results of aC
Parameter Estimation Results of d1C
Parameter Estimation Results of d2C
Parameter Estimation Results of k1C
Parameter Estimation Results of k2C
Parameter Estimation Results of KC
Parameter Estimation Results of nC
As seen the results are not consistent at all. It was assumed that the fluoresence observed would be directly proportional to the amount of proteins formed. The above results show that was not the case.
