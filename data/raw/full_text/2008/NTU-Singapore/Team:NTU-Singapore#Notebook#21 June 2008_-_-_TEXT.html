Hung
Greenbear : Come and collect the agar plates from 37 degrees C incubator, then put into 4 degrees C fridge.
E7-Empty plasmid, SupD-empty plasmid, T7ptag-empty plasmid have dozens of colonies (Yes! ^^).
Fe-GFP has 5 colonies.
pSB1A3 has some colonies while pSB1AC3 , pSB1AK3 , pSB1AT3 all have no colony :(
Agar plates with LacI-GFP transformed into Homemade cell and D5 (done by Chin Chong) have a weird pink color without any colony :(
Agar plate with LacI-GFP transformed into LuxS mutant(done by Hung,ChoonKit) has some colonies.
