RESULTS FROM THURSDAY TRANSFORMATION:
Plate of E7 got 4 colonies!!
Plate of T7ptag got 8 colonies!!
We also received LsrA and Lysis (lyophilized form) in Bluescript vector. We eluted them using TE buffer.
Afternoon:
1600: transform lysis and LsrA (0.3ul each) into competent cells.
1700: inoculate 4 colonies of E7 and 8 of T7ptag.
