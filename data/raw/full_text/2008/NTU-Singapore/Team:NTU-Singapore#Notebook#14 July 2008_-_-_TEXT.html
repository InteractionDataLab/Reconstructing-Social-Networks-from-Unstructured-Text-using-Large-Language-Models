LacI-GFP COLONIES!!
Miniprep of 18 colonies picked and one for T7ptag
Gel check was ran - 5 colonies had properly ligated LacI-GFP (got 1.1kb band), but T7ptag was not ligated well.
Well Done!
Ligation of Fe and GFP was also carried out.
pFe insert from last Friday (stored at -20). We also did nanodrops before ligating to measure the concentration.
GFP vector also from last Friday digestion.
This time, we used 2 insert:vector ratios (1:3 and 1:6).
