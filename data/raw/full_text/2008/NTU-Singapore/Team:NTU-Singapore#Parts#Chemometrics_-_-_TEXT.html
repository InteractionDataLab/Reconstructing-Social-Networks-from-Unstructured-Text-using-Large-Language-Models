Introduction
Correlations form an integral part in chemical engineering. Many phenomena observed in chemical processes have been extensively studied and relevant data collected to provide correlations between the variables of interest. This is to allow end users to be able to predict certain outcomes based on the knowledge of a specified variable if the correlation is availble. This practise is common when a process is not fully understood and a quick but efficient method to determine the process output is desired. Herein lies the aim of the next part of our project: to find a correlation between the amount of GFP produced and the fluorescence observed.
Model results and RFU data
A simple correlation was done between the model results and the RFU collected.
Initial Concept
The experiment we carried out was to obtain cells inoculated with lactose during the characterization process and to extract the protein from them. The RFU recorded at a particular time would be correlated with the amount of protein that the cell had within during the extraction. The protein quantification would come from a gel run of the proteins against a standard ladder.
The experiment showed that the amount of proteins in the cells was alike and this result was interesting in a sense.
Since the experiment did not yield the expected results, it was possible that the lactose provided the cells with the nutrients to multiply. A higher lactose concentration could mean that the cells were able to grow at a faster rate and produce a higher fluorescence reading.
