Plates with BL21 cells and Top10 cells both with LacI-GFP appears pinkish in normal light after overnight incubation
Under UV the redness becomes more obvious
Strange observation as it supposedly is Green Fluorescene and not Red Fluprescene
Received quotations for Lysis gene and LsrA gene synthesis from 1st Base, AtiBioTech
Redesigned primers of E7&Imm
Conduct Trial for Characterization of LacI-GFP with M9 medium
Use the M9 salts that were prepared the day before
Add glycerol as Carbon source
Inoculate BL21 and Top10 cells into two seperate 50ml tubes and incubate at 37 deg cel
Measure the OD at 600nm from time zero=time of incubation at hourly intervals
Results showed that the growth rate of cells in M9 medium is slow
Inoculate Top10 cells with LacI-GFP in 5ml of LBA, 5ml of M9 with LBA and 5ml of M9 in three different 50 ml tubes
Inoculate BL21 cells with LacI-GFP in 5ml of LBA
Prepared 20 LBA agar plates for future use

(4pm-530pm): transformation of 7 plasmids from the Registry:
LacI-GFP BBa_I763004
GFP producer BBa_E0840
GFP reporter device BBa_E0240
BBa_I20260: BBa_J23101 standard promoter - BBa_E0240 GFP reporter device
BBa_I20269 , BBa_I20270 , BBa_I20268 : GFP reporter devices with Weak (BBa_J23150), medium (BBa_J23151) and strong (BBa_J23102) promoters respectively.
Choon Kit
Digestion of pFe with SpeI/PstI, with SpeI (control) and with PstI (control).
Digestion of GFP producer with XbaI/PstI and with EcoRI/PstI(control).
Gel electrophoresis: sample cut with SpeI alone got smeared though only digested for 2 hours.
Gel extraction.
Ligation of pFe and GFP producer, cell ligation of GFP as a control.
Cell cloning of pFe-GFP, GFP self-ligation and 7 plasmids transformed by Hung.
