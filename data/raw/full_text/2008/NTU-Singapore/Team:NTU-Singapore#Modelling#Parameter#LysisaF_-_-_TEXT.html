Parameter aF analysis
Here we attempt to change aF over a range of values to observe how aF affects the production of the lysis protein.
Graph of aF (0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001)
Graph of aF (0.0001,0.00001 and 0.000001)
As we can see, when aF = 0.0001, any more reduction in its value by the order of 10 produces no significant change. We choose aF to be 0.0001 for this reason since it is the limiting value.
