Monday 9 June
Hung,Zhen Fu
Prepare plasmid DNA(in liquid form) of :
GFP producer x 2
RBS 0032 x 2
RBS 0034 x 2
Prepare digestion solutions for 6 above plasmids for later gel electrophoresis.
Choon Kit
Amplification of T7 promoter, 4 empty plasmids ( pSB1A3 , pSB1AT3 , pSB3K3 , pSB1AK3 ) from the Registry (as gel electrophoresis was not successful last week).
Gel electrophoresis running for GFP producer, RBS 0032 and RBS 0034.
Chin Chong, Darius
Prepare things to autoclave. (LB broth, pippette tips etc)
Prepare lactose/IPTG solution and LacI-GFP containing E coli cells for LacI-GFP characterization
Carry out trial for LacI-GFP characterization
0-10mM of lactose/IPTG was investigated
A 96 well reader is used
Cells used in wells were 200 uL
Varying the volumue of 100mM IPTG/lactose from 0 to 25 uL, and toping up with 50 uL to 25 uL of distilled water, stock of varying range of 0-100mM of lactose/IPTG was prepared in eppendorf tubes
The cells were induced with the respective concentraions of IPTG/lactose only before the measurement commences
Readings were planned to be collected overnight for 12hrs to have a rough guage of the maximum time possible for characterization
However, the settings of the PC connected to the multiplate reader were not programmed to be operated for overnight, and the readings collected stopped after an hour. The settings were subsequently altered the next day morning.
