Wednesday 2 July
Arrival of E7+Imm Oligo
PCR E7+Imm
Attempted Ligation of Fe-GFP & LacI-Rbs34
Failed Attempt due to faulty gel
Loading dye was unable to keep DNA sample settled at the bottom of the well
Samples settled into the gel and started floating out of it.
Preliminary Speculation of problem is due to loading dye.
Luchao, Hung
miniprep for pFe,pLacI,GFP and RBS 34
Transformation and cloning for BBa_I763004 LacI-GFP and BBa_J04450 LacI-RFP . (the transformation on Tuesday was uncessful possibly because of the old agar plates).
