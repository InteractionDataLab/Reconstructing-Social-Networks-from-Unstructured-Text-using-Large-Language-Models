ODEs used in modeling
In this section, we will have a short discussion on the ODEs used for Deterministic Modeling in our iGem project.
For the modeling exercise, we use mainly simple linear ODEs to describe the system we have at hand. These ODEs are used to describe processes such as constitutive transcription/ translation etc. Nonlinear equations are used for more complex processes such as regulated transcription. The choice of these equations are in hope that they can describe the system to a relative degree of accuracy and yet be simple enough to be solved. This is very much an engineering compromise between a rigorous description and getting an answer that is good enough which is required.
Our systems are based on the assumptions that Lumped parameter models are sufficient to describe them.
Lumped parameter models are those in which spatial variations are ignored and the dependent variables are uniform throughout the whole system. The only variations are those with respect to time leading to mathematical description in terms of the ODEs used.
The following equations show the break down of the different equations that will be used in this modeling exercise. By understanding this section, it would make the understanding of the system of ODEs used in our iGEm modeling exercise.
Constant synthesis & Linear Synthesis
Simple ode to describe constant synthesis
Gives an explicit analytical solution
Unique solution once a IC is posed
Linear Degradation
Rate of degradation is proportional to how much of the molecule is present
Gives an explicit analytical solution
Constant half life
Simple Forward Reaction
[C] : Complex
kc :  Rate constant of complex formation
This equation ignores the fact that dissociation of the complex occurs.  We can do so if the dissociation is much slower than the formation.
Single solvable equation for the unknown C
Simple, unique solution available with I.C
Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation
Assumptions:
Linear kinetic rate laws apply only if XT is much less than the Michaelis constants of both kinase and phosphotase
XT :
total cost of X protein in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form
S :
protein kinase concentration
k2 :
accounts for protein phosphotase
Modeled after simple linear kinetics
Gives a hyperbolic signal response curve when X plotted vs S
Regulated Transcription
[P]:

µ:
Repression, µ=0;

K:
Hill Constant Value of input that gives 50% response
n:

d:

k1:
basal gene expression
k:
signal-dependent gene expression
a:

This ODE attempts to capture characteristics of the mRNA dynamics
For our modeling, all our detection systems activates some form of transcription. Therefore µ=1 in all cases for our modeling exercise.
ODE system used in model
The system can be viewed as two parts. The first part comprises of lactose induced production of colicin E7 and the immunity protein. The second part comprises of a detection mechanism that produces the lysis protein upon the detection of both Iron ions and Ai-2 ( Autoinducer 2).
