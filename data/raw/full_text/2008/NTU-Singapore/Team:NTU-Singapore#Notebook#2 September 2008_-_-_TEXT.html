Tuesday 2 September
Morning: Lu Chao: minipreps for 6 samples from Monday and prepared 1% gel.
Hung: digestional gel check.
Results:
Among 2 samples of LacI-RBS-E7-Term, 1 sample showed correct bands!! 2.5 kb insert (total size of LacI+RBS+E7+Term) and 2kb vector (standard vector). The other sample is uncut LacI-RBS plasmid. The E7-Term was run together for comparison purpose.
The other samples (for minipreps) were correct.
Gel check 2 September.
YES!! So our production system is finally completed!!
