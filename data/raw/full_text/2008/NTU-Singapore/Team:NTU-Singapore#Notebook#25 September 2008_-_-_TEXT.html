Minipreps for LsrA-YFP, followed by digestional gel check.
Result: correct bands: 1kb insert (LsrA-RBS with YFP generator); 2kb vector
Make LuxS mutants more competent. Then transform detection system and production system into these newly made LuxS mutants.
Grow W3110 in LB plus 0.8% glucose for 4 hours, centrifuge and take the supernatant (which contains AI-2), store at -20 degrees C.
