1.1 Morning:
1.2 Afternoon:
1.3 Evening:
Friday 20 June
Morning:
Miniprep for pLacI, followed by DNA concentrating using QiAQuick PCR purification kit.
Afternoon:
Transformation and cell cloning 4 empty plasmids from Biobrick registry:
pSB1A3
pSB1AC3
pSB1AK3
pSB1AT3
Transformation and cloning of LacI-GFP into LuxS knockout bacteria.
Make LsrA competent cells. Then transform 0.3 ul LacI-GFP plasmid into these cells.
Evening:
Gel extraction (using QiAQuick Gel extraction Kit)==>Ligation (using T4 DNA ligase) ==> Transformation for the following 4 samples:
E7 Insert - Empty plasmid vector (from GFP)
SupD Insert - Empty plasmid vector (from GFP)
T7ptag Insert - Empty plasmid vector (from GFP)
GFP insert - pFE vector (for characterization of Fe promoter)
