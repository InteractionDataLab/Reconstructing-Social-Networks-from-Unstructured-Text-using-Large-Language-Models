Thursday 24 July
RESULT from Wednesday ligation and transformation:
E7-Term got 7 colonies!!
Lysis-standard vector and LsrA-standard vector got lots of colonies!!
Lysis-Term also got 5 colonies!!
Hung,Darius:
Digestional gel check for Lysis-Terminator (with Lysis and Term. for comparision) again (this time, we used 2% gel and 100bp ladder). We tried digesting for 1 hour, and 2 hours.
RESULT:
Digesting for 1 hour and 2 hour didn't make much differences.
All 3 Lysis-Term bands were actually just Term. So all the 3 colonies we obtained just contained the uncut Terminator.
NOTE:
For 2% gel, we should run for at least 1 hour in order to see clear and distinct bands.
Terminator vector is 3kb. (as contain both AmpR and KanR), not 2kb as presumed.
Bluescript vector is 2.5kb.
Inoculation: of the colonies we obtained this morning.
