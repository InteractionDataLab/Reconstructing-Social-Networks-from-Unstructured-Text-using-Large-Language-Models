Curve fit for 1mM Lactose
Graph of Gauss 1 to 4
As seen the 4th order Gaussian Fit does not give a result significantly better than the the 3rd order Gaussian fit. This is seen in the Spectral Residuals. We can use the 3rd order Gaussian fit as the curve for this Curve fit result.
Graph of Gauss 3
General model Gauss3:
f(x) =
a1*exp(-((x-b1)/c1)^2) + a2*exp(-((x-b2)/c2)^2) +
a3*exp(-((x-b3)/c3)^2)
Coefficients (with 95% confidence bounds):
a1 =       84.12  (41.48, 126.7)
b1 =        3636  (3547, 3724)
c1 =       633.4  (491.2, 775.5)
a2 =       36.33  (23.83, 48.84)
b2 =        2678  (2601, 2756)
c2 =       502.4  (409.5, 595.2)
a3 =       493.4  (487.1, 499.6)
b3 =        2023  (1345, 2700)
c3 =        6855  (4681, 9029)
Goodness of fit:
SSE: 129.2
R-square: 0.9947
Adjusted R-square: 0.994
RMSE: 1.399
