Monday 30 June:
Chin Chong
Stock check of items purchased so far and shifted them into new lab with Darius's help
Received quotation for LsrA-RBS and Lysis sequencing from Science Werke, confirmed the purchase and sequence should arrive in 2-4 weeks
Purchased items from SBS general store
Did inoculation of colonies from Top cells containing:
LacI-GFP BBa_I763004 ,
Standard promoter with GFP reporter BBa_I20260
GFP reporter devices with Weak BBa_J23150 ,
Medium BBa_J23151 and
Strong BBa_J23102 promoters
Incubate cells in 5ml of LB broth containing the respective anitbiotics and allow them to grow overnight
This is the slight modification from the standard protocol suggested in the Newsletter Vol.1 which used supplemented M9 medium instead of LB broth
M9 medium with glycerol will be introduced in the following day after the cells have been allowed to grow overnight in LB
Choon Kit, Zhen Fu,Hung:
Nanodrop to measure concentrations and purities of pFe,pLacI,GFP,RBS32,RBS34,pT7,Terminator. The data show a ratio of A260/A280 varying around 1.85 to 1.95, which mean the purities are quite good.
