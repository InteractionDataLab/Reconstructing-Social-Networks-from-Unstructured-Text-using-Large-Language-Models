Did a gel run for Lysis terminator.
However, unsuccessful gel showed a band between 100bp and 200bp. Correct size of Lysis terminator should be 300bp.
miniprep another 12 tubes of LsrA standard vector innoculated yesterday.
digestion of the plasmid extracted.
Gel run check
LsrA is successful. band at 140bp. Though abnormality similar to Lysis, a double band is observed. 110bp and 150bp respectively, very close to each other( estimation of values)
