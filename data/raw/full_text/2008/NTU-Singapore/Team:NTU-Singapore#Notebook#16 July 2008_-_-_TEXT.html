Wednesday 16 July
Morning: We carried out several digestion:
GFP with E/P in buffer 2 for 1 hour; in buffer 2 for 2 hours; and in EcoRI buffer for 2 hours (this aims to compare the efficiency of buffer 2 with EcoRIbuffer for E/P double digestion; as well as the optimal digestion time).
GFP with X/P in buffer 3 for 2 hours.
E7 with X/P in buffer 3 for 2 hours.
E7 and T7ptag with E/P in buffer 2 for 1.5 hours.
For all the digestions, the amounts used are:
DNA: 1000ng (around 5ul) Enzyme1: 1 ul Enzyme2: 1 ul Buffer: 5 ul BSA: 0.5 ul H2O: 37.5 ul Total: 50
1240: MinElute PCR pufification for the above 7 mixtures (obtain 10ul each after purification).
1650: gel extraction. After this, the digested DNAs were put in -20 fridge for ligation on Thursday.
1520: digestion for gel check of 12 samples of Fe-GFP inoculated yesterday. However,no colony was found correct.
