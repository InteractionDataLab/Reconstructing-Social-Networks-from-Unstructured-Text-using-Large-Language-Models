Personnel
Choon Kit, Hung, Darius:
Morning:
Take out 4 cryotubes (2 terminators, 2 LacI-GFP) from yesterday incubation, then spin them down, pour out the liquid to obtain cell pellets.
Prepare 6 digestion solutions for gel electrophoresis in the afternoon:
2 for terminators
2 for LacI-GFP
1 for CoE7 plasmid from BW strain (from -20 oC fridge)
1 for CoE7 plasmid from W3110 strain (from -20 oC fridge)
Afternoon:
Amplification for the following plasmids (from Registry):
GFP generator BBa_E0240
RBS BBa_B0032 and RBS BBa_B0034
T7 promoter BBa_I719005
Run gel for morning samples.
Inoculation of BW (2x),W3110 (2x), MG1655 (2x) for glycerol stock on Thursday.
Prepare LB broth
Prepare 17x LBA agar plates
