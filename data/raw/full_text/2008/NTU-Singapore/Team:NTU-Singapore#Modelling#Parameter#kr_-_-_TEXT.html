Parameter kr analysis
RFU Results
The above is the results from our characterisation experiment
Here we attempt to change kr over a range of values to observe how kr affects the production of the complex.
Graph of kr
Graph of kr
Here we choose kr=0.5 as it is most similar to the RFU production regime observed in our characterisation experiment.
