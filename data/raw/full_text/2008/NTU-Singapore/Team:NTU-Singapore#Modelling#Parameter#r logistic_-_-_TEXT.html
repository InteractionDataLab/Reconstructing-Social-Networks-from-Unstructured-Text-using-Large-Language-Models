Parameter r analysis
Graph of RFU Results
The above is the results from our characterisation experiment.
Here we attempt to change r over a range of values to observe how r affects the logistic growth output.

Graph of r
As seen the above run informs us that the growth rate at higher values cluster together and do not have much impact. We then investigate growth rates of lower values.

Here we choose r=0.01
