Digested Lysis and terminator for an 1 and a half hour.
did a variation of lysis and terminator between inserts and vectors.
Gel extracted lysis insert(E & X)(sequential digestion, PCR purification)and lysis vector(E and S)( Non sequential). Gel extracted terminator insert(S & P) and terminator vector(E & X) (sequential).
Fast ligation.
