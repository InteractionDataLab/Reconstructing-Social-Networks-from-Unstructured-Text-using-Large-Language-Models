Wednesday 25 June
Zhen Fu
10am:
take out the 50ml tubes incuated from Tuesday evening. Prepare the varying lactose concentratons (1 to 10 mM) as well as the controls in 1.5ml eppendorh tubes as preperations for Characterization
Chin Chong
10am:
Diluted the cells(Top 10 and BL21) from the 50ml tubes to OD 0.590 and re-incubate them to allow them to grow to 1.2
Hung
1030am:
take out the agar plates incubated from Tuesday night. For details of the plasmids, please refer to Tuesday notebook
GFP reporters with standard, weak, medium and strong promoters all have colonies.
GFP reporter device BBa_E2040 however shows no colony.
GFP producer BBa_E4080 shows a few colonies.
LacI-GFP shows no colony.
GFP self-ligation shows a few colonies.
pFe-GFP shows no colony.
11am: Group meeting to discuss about current obstacles encountered during wetlab.
Choon Kit
12:15pm:
digestion for:
pFe with SpeI/PstI
GFP with XbaI/PstI
pFe with SpeI to check SpeI activity
Terminator with SpeI to check SpeI activity
Incubate for 3 hours.
Chin Chong, Zhen Fu
2:30pm:
Proceed with the characterization experiment
Cells that were left to grow in the morning reached OD 1.2
Centrifuge the cells at 4400 rpm and at 25 deg C
Remove the LB broth and Resuspend the cells with M9 medium
Introduce the cells into the 96-well
Induce the cells with varying concentrations of lactose (1-10mM) in 1mM increments
Did Control 1: Cells with water, Control 2: M9 medium, Control 3: Water
Place the 96 well into FLx800™ Fluorescence Microplate Reader and followed the protocol as before and measure RFU for 12 hrs
Hung, Min-Lin
3:30pm:
Transform these following plasmids to Homemade top10 cells for amplification and obtaining new plasmids with higher purity (using new Miniprep Kit):
pT7 (ampR)
LacI (ampR)
RBS 34 (ampR)
RBS 32 (ampR)
GFP E0240 (ampR)
Terminator (AK resistance)
pFe (ampR)
empty plasmid with AmpR
Chin Chong, Zhen Fu
5pm: Prepare more empty 500ml bottles to autoclave for future use
Hung
6pm: cell cloning on agar plates for the above plasmids
6:30pm: inoculate in 5ul LBA each for:
LacI-GFP in top10
LacI-GFP in BL21 cell
self-ligated GFP cell
E0480 GFP producer cell
Choon Kit
3pm to 7pm:
Gel electrophoresis: controls of pFe and Terminator each show only 1 single band, which mean there's nothing wrong with SpeI.
Gel extraction of pFe (cut with SpeI and PstI) and GFP (cut with XbaI and PstI).
Gel electrophoresis again to check the extracted plasmids.
