Friday 12 September:
1200am: punching and dilution into TE buffer at 50 degrees C of pSB2K3 (for obtaining plasmid vector with KanR).
1230pm: digestion with E/P for Detection system (LsrA-RBS-Lysis-Term) (insert) and pSB2K3 (vector). Incubate for 2 hours until 3pm.
2pm-530pm: prepare LBK plates.
3pm-415pm: MinElute purification and Ligation (followed by another purification) for the insert and vector digested at 1230pm.
4pm: punching for BBa_E0430 (RBS-YFP-Term) and BBa_E0420 (RBS-CFP-Term)
430-6pm: Transformation for:
RBS-YFP-Term and RBS-YFP-Term into Top10 cells. (LBA plates)
LsrA-RBS-Lysis-Term (insert) ligated with pSB2K3 (vector) into top10 (and use LBK plate for selection).
Detection system (LsrA-RBS-Lysis-Term) and Production system (LacI-RBS-E7-Term) into LuxS k/o (LBA plates).
