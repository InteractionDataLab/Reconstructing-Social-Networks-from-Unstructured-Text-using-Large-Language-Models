1 Wednesday 23 July
1.1 Digestion for Terminator with X/P on 2% gel
1.2 Minipreps
1.3 Ligation and Transformation:
Wednesday 23 July
Hung, Min:
Digestion for Terminator with X/P on 2% gel
As we could not see the band of Terminator insert on Tuesday to extract)
Gel loading and extraction + nanodrops.
stored at -20 fridge for later ligation.
Minipreps
for the 12 samples inoculated on Tuesday (including Lysis-Term,Term,E7 and T7ptag)
Digestional gel check: we did normal digestion (E/P for 2 hours):
3 lysis-term.
1 Term (for comparision with Lysis-Term)
1 Lysis (for comparision with Lysis-Term)
1 E7
1 T7ptag
We also tested Fast digestion for T7ptag for 5 mins.
RESULT: As we used 1kb ladder, we actually could not tell whether the Lysis-Term bands were correctly ligated (about 250bp) or they're just Term(129bp). We'll check again on Thursday, using 2% gel and 100bp ladder.
Ligation and Transformation:
E7(V)-Term(I): E7(V) taken from -20 fridge (from Tuesday); Term (I) was obtained today.
Lysis(I)-Term(V): we just transformed another 3ul of ligation mixture among 7ul left from Monday into cells.
Lysis(I)-Empty standard vector: digested DNAs from -20 fridge.
LsrA(I)-Empty standard vector: digested DNAs from -20 fridge.
NOTE:After ligation, we used QIAgen PCR purification kit to purify (instead of MinElute as the columns wouldn't arrive until next week). Therefore, when transforming into the cells, we used 9ul (from 30ul after purification) instead of 3ul.
