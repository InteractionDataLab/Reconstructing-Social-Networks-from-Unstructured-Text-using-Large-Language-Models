Experiments
Morning:
Take out the PCR samples
Prepare digestion solutions for T7, GFP producer, RBS 0032 and 0034, Immunity 1 and 2, CoE7, LsrA 1 and 2.
Afternoon:
Gel electrophoresis.
Inoculation of GFP producer, RBS 0034 and RBS 0032 as the gel electrophoresis showed wrong results.
Transformation of LacI-GFP plasmid into top10 competent cells for characterization of LacI promoter next week.
