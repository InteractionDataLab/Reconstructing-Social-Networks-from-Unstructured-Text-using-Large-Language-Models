We would like to extend our special thanks to A/Prof William Chen for his guidance and help rendered to the iGEM team. We would also like to thank Dr Tan Tuan Lin for guiding the team and providing valuable insights for the experiments. Without their expertise and time, the project will not have gone this far in such a short time.
