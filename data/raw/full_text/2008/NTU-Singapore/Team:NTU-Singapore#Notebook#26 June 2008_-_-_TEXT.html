Thursday 26 June
10:30am to 12:30pm:
Min-Lin, Hung: miniprep (with new kit) for:
GFP self-ligated plasmid (control)
GFP producer E0480
Choon Kit: nanodrop for digested Fe, GFP to evaluate the amount for ligation.
2pm to 4pm:
Choon Kit: ligation of pFE and GFP (with some new improvements), using 2 pFe:GFP ratios (1:4 and 1:7)
Hung:
Prepare digestion mixture for GFP self-ligated and GFP E0480
Loading gel for GFP self-ligated, GFP E0480, Fe-GFP (1:4) and Fe-GFP (1:7)
4:30pm to 7pm:
Choon Kit, Hung: transformation + cloning for:
Fe-GFP (1:4) and Fe-GFP (1:7) : using commercial top 10
LacI-GFP: using homemade top10
Min-Lin: inoculation (2 tubes for each plate) for pFe , pT7, Terminator, empty plasmid with AmpR, RBS32, RBS34, GFP 0240, LacI-GFP (in BL21), LacI.
