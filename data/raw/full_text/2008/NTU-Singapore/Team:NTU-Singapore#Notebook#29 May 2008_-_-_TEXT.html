Wednesday
ChinChong (~~)
Requested E coli strain B2B110 with the ColE7 plasmid from Professor David Gordon (Australia)
Requested quotation from Invitrogen on some chemicals and kits
Discussed possible experiments design to patch up the parts of our BioBrick
Finding parameters for the modeling from literature
Darius
Come up with provisional LacI experiment design
Discussed possible experiments design to patch up the parts of our BioBrick
Choon Kit
Plasmid Extraction using Qiagen Miniprep. Ligation using EcoRI and PstI
Alias with Professor Yuan Hanna (Taiwan)to get E7+Imm plasmid, expected arrival 5th Jun 08
Alias with Professor Chris Viogt (UCSF) to get AND modular plasmids, expected arrival 5th Jun 08
Requested full DNA sequence of ColE7 and Imm plasmid from Zhong Zhi Hao (Taiwan)
Requested full DNA sequence of AND modular plasmids from Chris Voigt (UCSF)
Documented laboratory work for 28 and 29 May 2008
Hung
Plasmid Extraction using Qiagen Miniprep. Ligation using EcoRI and PstI (basically phase II and up to step 3 of phase III of experiment 3 for iron promoter. We left the DNAs incubated overnight instead of for 2hrs due to time constraint.)
Finding parameters for the modeling from literature
ZhenFu
Improve our group's model with some literature parameters
Added equations to our model
Puzzled over results of simulation, shall work on it further with other members of the group
