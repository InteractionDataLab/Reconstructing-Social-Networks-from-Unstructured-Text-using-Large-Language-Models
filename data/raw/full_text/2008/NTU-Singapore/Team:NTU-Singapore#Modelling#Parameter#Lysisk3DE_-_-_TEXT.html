1 Parameter k3DE analysis
1.1 k3DE variation
1.1.1 k3DE = 0.00000001
1.1.2 k3DE = 0.0000001
1.1.3 k3DE = 0.000001
1.1.4 k3DE = 0.00001
1.1.5 k3DE = 0.0001
1.1.6 k3DE = 0.001
1.1.7 k3DE = 0.01
Parameter k3DE analysis
In the graphs below, the blue lines represent the lysis protein production under iron induction alone. The red lines represent the production of lysis protein when no iron or Auto-inducer 2 is added.
k3DE variation
k3DE = 0.00000001
Graph of k3DE=0.00000001
k3DE = 0.0000001
Graph of k3DE=0.0000001
k3DE = 0.000001
Grpah of k3DE=0.000001
k3DE = 0.00001
Graph of k3DE=0.00001
k3DE = 0.0001
Graph of k3DE=0.0001
k3DE = 0.001
Graph of k3DE=0.001
k3DE = 0.01
Graph of k3DE=0.01
It is clear that when k3DE = 0.00000001 will there be a pronounced difference between the different situations. It is the main reason why this parameter was chosen to take on this value even though it is not very realistic.
