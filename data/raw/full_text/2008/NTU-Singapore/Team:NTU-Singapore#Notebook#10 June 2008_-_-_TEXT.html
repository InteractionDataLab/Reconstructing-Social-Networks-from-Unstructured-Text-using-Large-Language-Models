Morning:
Choon Kit, Hung: digestion of BBa_B0015 terminator and E7 plasmid with SpeI and XbaI.
Objective: to put E7 insert into empty vector from Terminator plasmid.

Afternoon:
Gel electrophoresis for digested E7 (PCR product) and empty plasmid vector (extracted from BBa_B0015 plasmid)
Result: E7 insert showed a correct 2kb band. Empty plasmid vector showed a smear of bands, hence it was not digested properly by SpeI and XbaI.
Inoculation for T7 promoter.
Night (9 to 10 pm):
Do an overnight digestion (cut with XbaI and SpeI) to obtain empty plasmid vector from RBS B0032 , RBS B0034
The amount added to each digestion sample is stated in the below table (unit: ul)

Prepare new stock for Ecoli cells containing Laci-GFP
Auto-clave the tips and LB broth
Re-run PCR for E7-imm to produce more stock for further use
Carry out LacI-GFP characterization with varying concentration using a fluorescence mutiplate reader (96 well)
2 range of IPTG/lactose were investigated over 4 hours
1st range 0-2 mM in 0.2mM increments
2nd range 0-10 mM in 2mM increments
Results from the lacI-GFP characterization shows that there is an increasing trend in GFP fluorescence for all samples
Wells containing higher concentration of IPTG and lactose seems to have a higher fluorescence reading
Effective range of IPTG should be from 0-2 mM. As readings from 4 to 10 mM appears to be similar.
