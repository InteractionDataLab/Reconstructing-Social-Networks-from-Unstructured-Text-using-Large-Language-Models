Tuesday 26 August
Morning: Lu Chao: minipreps of 6 colonies inoculated on Monday and prepared 2% gel for later gel check.
Hung: digestional check:
Results:
Among 4 samples of LsrA-RBS-Lysis-Term, 1 sample showed the correct bands: 2kb vector + 450bp insert (total length of LsrA+RBS+Lysis+Term). Our detection+lysis system is done!!
2 samples of LacI-RBS-E7-Term showed wrong bands. However, ligation mixture for this was still not used up. We would transform the remaining mixture into top10 cells on Friday.
from left to right: 1kb ladder, 2xLacI-RBS-E7-Term, 100bp ladder, LsrA-RBS(for comparing), 4xLsrA-RBS-Lysis-Term, Lysis-Term(for comparing)
