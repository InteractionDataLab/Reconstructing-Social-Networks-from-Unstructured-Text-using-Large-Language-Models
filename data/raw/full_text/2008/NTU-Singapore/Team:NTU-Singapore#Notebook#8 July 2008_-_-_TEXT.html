Tuesday 8 July
Ran PCR for T7 ptag and SupD.
Gel extraction of E7 (clear clean bands - yay!).
900-1130: Lu Chao: minipreps and nanodrops for pLacI, pFe, RBS 34, GFP (3 samples for each plasmid).
Hung:
1030-1130: as the Minelute PCR purification columns are temporarily out of stock, I used the QIA PCR purification kit to purify a PCR E7 (20ul), and the GFP that was digested with EcoRI/PstI and gel-extracted on last Friday (50ul). Nanodrop showed quite low concentration and purity. However, later gel run showed clear and distinct bands for E7 (2kb) and GFP (800b).
1200-1215: digestion of GFP with XbaI/PstI to obtain empty plasmid vector (as Darius was also synthesizing E7 with XbaI/PstI restriction sites). Incubate at 37 degress for 4 hours (until 1615).
1300-1330: ligation at 1:3 ratio for:
pFe-GFP
LacI-GFP
Note:We tried additional step for ligation: incubate insert/vector mixture at 50 degrees for 5 mins, then put on ice for 1 min, pulse spin then start adding buffer, and quick ligase.
1340-1400: PCR purification for ligation mixtures. Then ligation mixtures were put on ice until transformation at 1610 (carried out together with LacI-RBS34).
1610-1810: Lu Chao: transformation and cell cloning for LacI-RBS 34 (use 0.5 ul of the succesfully ligated product), LacI-GFP (use both 1ul, 3ul and 4ul to transform into Homemade top10 cells)  and pFe-GFP (use both 1ul, 3ul and 4ul to transform into Homemade top10 cells).
1620-1645: QIA purification for GFP digested with XbaI/PstI at 1200. Nanodrop showed very good concentration and purity. That means we can trust this kit to purify our digested mixtures.
Wednesday we're trying to ligate E7 with empty plasmid using different cutting sites (EcoRI/PstI and XbaI/PstI).
Gel Story
Pre Staining is ineffective.
Reasons-Inconsistent Cooling process, Formation of clumps of gel during cooling, non homogenous gel led to inconsistent Gel results.
Conclusion POST STAINING
E7 PCR Story
E7 PCR tube Gel Run-Smeary gel
Gel Extract-50ul-Concentrate to 30ul using PCR purification kit
Gel run..clean clear bands at 2k mark
E7 PCR Direct Run Ethidium Bromide Gel
Gel run was good.
Confirming that post Staining of gel is good
T7ptag Story PCR T7ptag using 1:50, 1:20, direct plasmids and T7ptag PCR as templates
SupD Story PCR SupD using 1:20 Plasmid and PCR Product as templates
