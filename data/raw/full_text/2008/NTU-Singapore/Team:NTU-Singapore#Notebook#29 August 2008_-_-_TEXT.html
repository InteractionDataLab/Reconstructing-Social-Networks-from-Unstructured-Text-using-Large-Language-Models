Friday 29 August
Lu Chao: prepared new top10 competent cells (60x50ul tubes).
Hung: transformation into top10 for:
The remaining ligation mixture of LacI-RBS-E7-Term.
LacI-RBS (as only 1 tube of LacI-RBS was left)(for minipreps purpose).Also, newly prepared top10 was used to transform as a check of their efficiency.
LsrA-RBS-Lysis-Term (our detection system that was done on Tuesday). (for minipreps purpose).Also, newly prepared top10 was used to transform as a check of their efficiency.
