Saturday 5 July
Among the plates collected, only the plate of LacI-RFP has colonies. Plates with E7-empty plasmid and LacI-GFP do not have colony.
Lu Chao
minipreps for LacI-RBS 34.
Hung, Lu Chao
Nanodrop to determine concentrations and purities of LacI-RBS 34 plasmids, which show good results.
Prepare digestion mixtures for gel confirmation.
Darius
Gel electrophoresis to check if there are LacI-RBS 34 plasmids.
Result: All have the 2000 kb band, the empty vector plasmid (expected). Besides that band:
There is 1 sample that only has 250 bp band, which is LacI-RBS 34. (Good!!)
There is 2 samples that have both 250 bp band and less than 50 bp band, which can be interpreted as RBS (due to self-ligation of RBS).
The rest only have the RBS band.
