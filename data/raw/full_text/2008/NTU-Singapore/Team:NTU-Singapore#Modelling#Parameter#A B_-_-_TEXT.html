Parameter A & B analysis
Graph of RFU Results
The above is the results from our characterisation experiment
Here we attempt to change A & B over a range of values to observe how the two values affect the production of the complex. We are bound by a simple condition that A > B. We set A = 1 and vary B over a range.
Graph of A & B
Graph of A&B
We see here that as B gets closer to A the output it reduced. We choose B = 0.9 and A = 1, a 9:10 ratio.
