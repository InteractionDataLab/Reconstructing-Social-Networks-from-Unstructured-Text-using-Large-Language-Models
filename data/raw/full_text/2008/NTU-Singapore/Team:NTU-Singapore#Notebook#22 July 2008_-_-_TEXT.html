1 Tuesday 22 July
1.1 Ligation of E7 (vector) with Terminator (insert)
1.2 Ligation of lysis and LsrA into standard vector:
1.3 Inoculation:
1.4 Ligation of Lysis (I) and Terminator (V):
Tuesday 22 July
Hung,Lu Chao, Min:
Ligation of E7 (vector) with Terminator (insert)
E7: cut with S/P for 2 hours
Terminator: cut with X/P for 2 hours
1245: QIA PCR purification
1300: gel loading (each sample into 3 lanes)
1400: staining
1430: Gel extraction, nanodrops. After that, we stored the digested DNAs (ready for ligation) at -20 fridge for ligation on Wednesday.
Ligation of lysis and LsrA into standard vector:
Cut Lysis,LsrA and GFP with E/P in Buffer 2, incubated for 2 hours.
1345: QIA PCR purification
1400: gel loading (each sample into 3 lanes)
1500: staining
1530: Gel extraction, nanodrops. After that, we stored the digested DNAs (ready for ligation) at -20 fridge for ligation on Wednesday.
Inoculation:
3 lysis-terminator colonies transformed on Monday.
3 E7-empty vector and 3 T7ptag-empt vector colonies.
3 Terminator colonies (obtain more terminator plasmid for ligation).
Ligation of Lysis (I) and Terminator (V):
Do the same as Monday, in case all 3 colonies of Lysis-Term. are wrong.
