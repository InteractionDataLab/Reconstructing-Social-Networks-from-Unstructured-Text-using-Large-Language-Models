Hung,Choon Kit,Zhen Fu:
Morning:
Take out from the incubator 4 cryotubes. After spinning down, the tubes were observed:
2 tubes with LBA contained no cell pellets at all as expected.
2 tubes with LB without Amp. had cell pellets at the bottom. We then poured out the liquid and the tubes at -20 oC fridge for future use.
Take out from the incubator 5 agar plates. All had cell colonies growing on them except for LBA BW-W3110 plate. We stored them at 4 oC fridge.
Afternoon:
Inoculation to obtain 4 cryotubes:
2 containing LBA with BBa_B0015 plasmid cells
2 containing LBA with LacI-GFP plasmid cells
Incubate 4 tubes overnight
