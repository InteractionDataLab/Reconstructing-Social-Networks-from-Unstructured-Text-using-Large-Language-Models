Ligation of E7 into empty plasmid vector extracted from GFP plasmid.
Gel electrophoresis for the E7 plasmids synthesized by PCR (with 2 blunt ends recognized by EcoRI and PstI).
Gel extraction of E7 bands (around 2kb) to remove all the oligonucleotides.
Purification for E7 after extracted.
Digestion of GFP by EcoRI and PstI. Incubation for 3 hours.
Digestion of purified E7 by EcoRI and PstI. Incubation for 3 hours.
Gel electrophoresis and gel extraction for GFP to get the empty plasmid vector (around 2kb).
PCR purification for digested E7 to remove all the enzymes, buffers and small nucleotides.
Ligation of empty plasmid (from GFP) and E7 insert.
Transformation and cloning into homemade top10 cells.
Lu Chao, Hung
transformation and cell cloning of LacI-GFP and LacI-RFP again.
Lu Chao
inoculation of LacI-RBS cells.
