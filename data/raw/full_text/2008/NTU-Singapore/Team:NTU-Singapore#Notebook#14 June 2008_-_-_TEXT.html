Chin Chong
Prepared the dilution of BL21 cells and Top10 cells containing the LacI-GFP to OD 0.3 with the use of LBA broth
Conducted the characterization of LacI-GFP using the range of 0-10mM of IPTG and lactose with Zhen Fu
cells that were diluted to 0.3 OD were pippetted into wells of the 96-well Uclear Black, purchased from Greiner
IPTG and lactose of varing concentration were pippetted into the respective wells as planned out in the protocol
The protocol that was used in the previous characterization experiment were used, with a slight modification
The sensitivity setting of 25 was used in previous cases, but after suggestions from PhD student from BIE, a setting of 30 was used this time round
The other settings were as per previous trials
Zhen Fu
Prepared the varying concentrations IPTG and Lactose from 100mM stock solutions
0-10mM range was required hence varying amounts of IPTG and lactose 100mM concentration were used to acheive the range for a 250uL working volume
Conducted the characterization experiment with Chin Chong
Collected the agar plates that were grew overnight and stored in 4 deg fridge
Collected the PCR products from thermal cycler and stored in 4 deg fridge
