Signal molecules
These signaling molecule were used in the cellular communication systems we used in this project to regulate the activity of certain promoter activation proteins in the hybrid promoters we designed and built.
Gram (-) bacteria use:
3-oxo-C6-HSL, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, an AHL
DPD, the AI-2 precursor, 4,5 dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione
HHQ, 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone, an AQ
Gram (+) bacteria use:
DPD, the AI-2 precursor, 4,5 dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione
A-Factor, 2-isocapryloyl-3-hydroxymethyl--butyrolactone
PQS, pseudomonas quinolone signal, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone
DSF, ‘diffusible factor’, cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid
3OH-PAME, hydroxyl-palmitic acid methyl ester;
AIP-1, staphylococcal autoinducing peptide 1
