Cell-to-cell signaling by XOR gate constructs - The ability of two different XOR gate constructs to send a signal via the Lux system was measured by coplating bacterial XOR clones with bacteria containing a Lux receiver construct.
Positive control using a Lux sender and a Lux receiver (K09100) Green fluorescence indicates LuxI expression in the Lux sender and receipt of the intercellular signal by the receiver.
XOR gate construct K091173 coplated with the K09100 Lux receiver.  Green fluorescence indicates that at least one of the two hybrid promoters in the XOR construct is driving expression of the LuxI gene.
XOR gate construct K091182 coplated with the K09100 Lux receiver.  Green fluorescence indicates that at least one of the two hybrid promoters in the XOR construct is driving expression of the LuxI gene.
Improved pLac promoter called pLacIQ1
We introduced mutations into the Lac promoter in order to improve its ability to promote transcription.  The graph below shows the results of an experiment with GFP reporting that demonstrates that the new Lac promoters function better than the existing Registry promoter.
