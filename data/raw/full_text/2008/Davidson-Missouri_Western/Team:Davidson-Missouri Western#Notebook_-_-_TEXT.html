Notebook
The team kept a combined notebook on a local wiki housed at Davidson College.  The wiki was essential for internal communication on each campus and for external communication between the two campuses.  Much of the material from the local wiki has been transfered to this, the iGEM wiki.  Interested parties are welcomed and encouraged to visit the team's notebook wiki at the following link: Davidson-Missouri Western Summer Wiki Notebook
