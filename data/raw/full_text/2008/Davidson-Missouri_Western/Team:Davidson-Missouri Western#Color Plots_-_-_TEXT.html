The Models
Split Model
This code hashes all messages with the split model to a single character in the output. The user must input a message in string format, a key (one character) in string format, the number of characters in user's alphabet, and the decimal value (ascii) of the starting character of the alphabet.
Spoke Model
This code hashes all messages with the spoke model to any fixed amount of characters in the output. The user must input a message in string format, a key (one character) in string format, the number of characters in the user's alphabet, and the number of characters desired in the output. This code assumes that the decimal value of the starting character of the alphabet is 0.
Color Plot Generator
Color Plot Generator
Color Plots Sorted by Hash Output
All Outputs in Single Plot
This code makes a color plot with all possible messages (of indicated length) and keys sorted by the outputs each message/key combination hashes to. The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Each Output in Separate Plot
This code makes color plots for each hash output. Each color plot includes all messages (of indicated length) and keys that hash to that hash output. The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Color Plots Sorted by Messages Inputed
All Messages in Single Plot
This code makes a color plot with all messages (of indicated length), keys, and corresponding hash output sorted by messages (in alphabetical order).The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Messages of Same 1st Character in Same Plot
This code makes color plots for each set of messages (of indicated length) with same 1st character. Each color plot includes each set of messages with same 1st character, all key combinations for each message, and each hash output for each message/key combination. The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Color Plots Sorted by Keys
All Keys in Single Plot
This code makes a color plot with messages (of indicated length), keys, and corresponding hash outputs sorted by key (in alphabetical order).The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Each Key in Separate Plot
This code makes color plots for each key. Each color plot includes all messages (of indicated length), one key, and each each output for each message/key combination. The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Plots of Key and Output Relations
Each Key and Output Combination in Separate Plot
This code makes color plots for each different key and hash output combination. Each color plot includes all messages (of indicated length) for each separate key and  and hash output combination.The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
Key/Output Patterns
This code makes color plots for all messages (of indicated length) that have the same hash outputs for all key and message combinations for all possible sets of keys. Example: 2 messages with key A hash to B, with key B hash to C, and with key C hash to A, would be plotted together.The user must input the length of messages to be plotted, the character the alphabet starts with, the character the alphabet ends with, and the hashing method desired.
