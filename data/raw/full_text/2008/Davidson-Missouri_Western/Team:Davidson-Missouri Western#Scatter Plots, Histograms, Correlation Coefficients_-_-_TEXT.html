Analysis Codes
Scatter Plot/Histogram/Correlation Coefficient Generator
This code generates a scatter plot, histogram, and correlation coefficient for each Hash Function Model. These plots are only useful for models that have a single character hash output. The user must input the probability of occurrence of each character in the ascii alphabet (either equal or unequal probabilities), the number of characters in the group of messages tested, the number of messages to be generated and plotted, which hash model to use to get outputs to plot, the size of each ring (if applicable), and the minimum amount of layers of rings (if applicable).
Plot Generator for 4 Letter Alphabet
This code generates a scatter plot, histogram, and correlation coefficient for each Hash Function Model (for messages only consisting of a 4 character alphabet).
Scatter Plot and Correlation Coefficient Generator for multiple Hash Outputs
This code generates scatter plots and correlation coefficients for the Split and Spoke Model. Any length hash output can be tested. The user must input the probability of occurrence of each character in the ascii alphabet (either equal or unequal probabilities), the number of characters in the group of messages tested, the number of messages to be generated and plotted, and the number of characters desired in each hash output.
The Models
Twist Model
This code hashes all messages with the twist model to any fixed amount of characters in the output. The user must input a message in string format, the number of characters in the user's alphabet, the size of each ring, the number of characters desired in the output, and the minimum amount of layers of rings.
Net Model (One Character Output)
This code hashes all messages with the net model to a single character in the output. The user must input a message in string format, the size of the ring, and the minimum amount of layers of rings.
Net Model (Any Amount of Characters in Output)
This code hashes all messages with the net model to any fixed amount of characters in the output. The user must input a message in string format, the number of characters in the user's alphabet, the decimal value (ascii) of the starting character of the alphabet, the size of each ring, the number of characters desired in the output, and the minimum amount of layers of rings.
Split Model for 128 Character Alphabet
This code hashes all messages with the split model to a single character in the output. The user must input a message in string format and a key (one character) in string format.
Split Model for Any Alphabet
This code hash all messages with the split model to a single character in the output. The user must input a message in string format, a key (one character) in string format, the number of characters in user's alphabet, and the decimal value (ascii) of the starting character of the alphabet.
Spoke Model for 128 Character Alphabet
This code hashes all messages with the spoke model to any fixed amount of characters in the output. The user must input a message in string format, a key (one character) in string format, the number of characters in the user's alphabet, and the number of characters desired in the output. This code assumes that the decimal value of the starting character of the alphabet is 0.
Spoke Model for Any Alphabet
This code hashes all messages with the spoke model to any fixed amount of characters in the output. The user must input a message ins string format, a key (one character) in string format, the number of characters in the user's alphabet, the decimal value (ascii) of the starting character of the alphabet, and the number of characters desired in the output. This code enables the user to choose the decimal value of the starting character of the alphabet.
Character Frequency Documents
Unequal Character Frequencies
This document is used in above codes as a data base of frequencies of characters (from the ascii alphabet) that occur in typical word documents (not every character in the ascii alphabet will thus not occur at equal frequency).
Equal Character Frequencies
This document is used in above codes as a data base of frequencies of characters (from the ascii alphabet) occurring equally.
