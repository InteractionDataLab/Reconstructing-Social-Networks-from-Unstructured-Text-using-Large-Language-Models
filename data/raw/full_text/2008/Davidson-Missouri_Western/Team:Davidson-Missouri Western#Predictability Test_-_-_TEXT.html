Team:Davidson-Missouri Western/Predictability Test
From 2008.igem.org
Horizontal axis corresponds to hash value of multiple messages of fixed length (usually 10,000 randomly generated messages).
Vertical axis corresponds to hash value of each original message with one character randomly changed to another character.
The more patterns and white space the more predictable the model.
