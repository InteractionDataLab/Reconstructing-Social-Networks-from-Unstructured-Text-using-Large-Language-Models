Notebook
Below are links to the registry page for each of the hybrid promoters our team designed and built. These promoters were designed to be regulated by two proteins with one of these proteins being regulated by a small organic molecule.
pLuxR/cI
This promoter is a hybrid between the lambda CI promoter and the LuxR promoter. It is designed to respond to activation by LuxR protein when it is bound to AHL and to repression by the phage lambda cI repressor protein.
pMnt/Lac
This promoter is a modified version of the Mnt promoter that is also responsive to LacI. The promoter should be repressed by Mnt repressor and also be repressed by LacI. In the absence of Mnt repressor and presence of LacI it should be induced by IPTG.
pLsrA/cI
This promoter is a hybrid between the LsrA promoter and the lambda cI promoter. It is designed to be repressed by the cI repressor or the LsrR repressor. Derepression can occur when phospho-AI-2 binds to the LsrR repressor and cI is absent.
pLasR/cI
This promoter is a hybrid between the LasR and lambda cI promoters. It is designed to be repressed by the lambda cI repressor and activated by the LasR activator when it is bound by phospho-AI-1.
pMnt/Tet
This promoter is a modified version of the Mnt promoter that is also responsive to TetR. The promoter should be repressed by Mnt repressor. It should also be repressed by TetR, and in the absence of Mnt repressor, should be induced by aTc.
