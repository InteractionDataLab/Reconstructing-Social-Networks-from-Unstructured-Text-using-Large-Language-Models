From 2008.igem.org
Lux cell signaling system
Responsible: Andrew Gordon and Pallavi Penumetcha
Signal molecule: N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) Generic term for a variety of species specific hormone-like molecules
Bacterial species: discovered in Vibrio fischeri known to work in E. coli
Receiver protein: LuxR protein receives signal from AHL; also has some control over transciption of luciferase
Signal molecule synthase: LuxI; also has some control over transciption of luciferase
Additional Information: "Quorum Quenching" aiiA (intracellular) lactonase reduces AHL concentration
