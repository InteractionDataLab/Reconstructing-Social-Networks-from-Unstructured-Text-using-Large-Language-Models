Table Generators
Table of Hash Outputs for Any Alphabet
This code generates a table of hash outputs generated by both the split and spoke models for each message (of indicated length) and key combinations (from indicated alphabet). The user must input the starting character of the alphabet, the ending character of the alphabet, and the length of the message.
Table of Hash Outputs for Fixed 128 Character Alphabet
This code generates a table of hash outputs generated by both the split and spoke models for each message (of indicated length) and key combinations (from full 128 character ascii alphabet). The user must input the starting character of the alphabet, the ending character of the alphabet, and the length of the message.
The Models
Split Model
This code hashes all messages with the split model to a single character in the output. The user must input a message in string format and a key (one character) in string format.
Spoke Model
This code hashes all messages with the spoke model to any fixed amount of characters in the output. The user must input a message in string format, a key (one character) in string format, the number of characters in the user's alphabet, and the number of characters desired in the output. This code assumes that the decimal value of the starting character of the alphabet is 0.
