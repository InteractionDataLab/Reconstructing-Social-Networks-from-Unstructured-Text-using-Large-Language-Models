Colors correspond to letters, first n columns include all possible letter combinations for n length message. n +1 column corresponds to key used (includes all possible key combinations for each possible message). n+2 column corresponds to output hash value (number of columns for number of letters in fixed output).
Input arbitrary, output fixed -Can have any amount of letters (see Let columns) and will only have a fixed, uniform amount of hash columns (see Hash column).
Not Reversible - Possible colors in Hash Column correspond to many letter and key color combinations and thus can not trace an output color back to one single message and key combination.
At least one Collision -  At least one Hash output (color) corresponds to multiple letter and key color combinations.
Minimal Collisions – Equal distribution of letter and key combinations to each hash output (represented by equal lengths of colors in hash column).
