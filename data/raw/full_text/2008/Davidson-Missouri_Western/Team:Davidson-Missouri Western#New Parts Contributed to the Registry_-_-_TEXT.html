Parts Submitted to the Registry
Notebook
The Davidson-Missouri Western team contributed 105 new parts to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. New basic parts contributed included seven novel hybrid promoters, seven promoters and genes to support the Lsr cellular communication system, two improved versions of the pLac promoter, and three new variants of the Lac repressor.  All basic parts were sequenced verified.  Intermediate parts were constructed by combining new and existing Registry parts. Devices were designed and constructed to function as biological XOR gates and cellular communication components.
