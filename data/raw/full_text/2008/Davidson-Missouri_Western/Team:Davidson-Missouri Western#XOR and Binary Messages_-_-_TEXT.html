Binary Encoding
The input message must be converted to binary before computation begins. We used an ascii table to convert each letter in message to a decimal number, which is then converted to binary as shown in the following examples.
XOR logic
We used XOR logic to build our cryptographic hash function with E. coli.   XOR, or eXclusive OR, is a logic gate that produces a value of true if and only if exactly one of its inputs is true.
The truth table for p XOR q (also written as p + q, p ⊕ q, or p ≠ q) is as follows:
Exclusive Disjunction

q
p ⊕ q
