Welcome to the iGem wiki page of Team Beijing Normal Universty. Our team has five students, Forrest Sheng Bao , Jingyi Wang , Gang Wu , Sheng Feng and Ya He . Our members are of five different majors, from four different universities over two countries. Hmm, an international multidisciplinary one, uh? Yup!
Jingyi Wang and Gang Wu are in charge of designing the whole project, experiment and all the other things related. Sheng Feng helps them on some experimental stuff. Shi Chen will do modeling jobs and finally presentation. Forrest edits the wiki while Ya writes the essay.
For our most recent information, please check the Notebook page.
