17th June:        Attend the Asian Workshop meeting.
17th July:        Meet up with Tsinghua Team, and learn fron their experiences.
25th July:        With Invitrogen.Co. Ltd and Tsinghua team to sign up a contract.
27th July:        Have a discussion with Tsinghua team about the transformation efficiency.
We generalize some key words from the discussion:
1. Make sure the concentration of the plasmids from the biobrick is enough for transformation.
2. Keep a low temprature when enzyme digestion is performed
3. The transformation product are always incubated for more than 1h.
9th September:   We and Tsinghua team get together in our lab. We have a happy time together and share a lot.
10th September:  We provide Tsinghua Team with the cells harboring pSB1AC3 plasmids. We did the the tramsformation for them. Because they found their transformation effeciency is relatively low.
17th September:  Tsinghua Team told us that the vector that we provided proved to work well. We were all pretty happy about this positive result.
3th October:      We and Chiba Team had a happy conversation via googletalk today. We share all the success and frustrations in the process. And we exchange our opinion about promotor function measurement. They told us that they have used BBa_T9002 because their project uses quorum sensing and the part(T9002) was GFP producer controlled by 3OC6HSL Receiver Device.And their result is pretty satisfying.
5th October:      We share the experience of measurment with Tokyo Tech University Team. They tell us to use BBa_I13522 ( http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13522 ) as a positive control when we measure the function of promotors.
9th October:      We test the founction of Part BBa_I719015. The result indicates that it works well. The cells (BL21(DE3) as host) turn  green when induced by IPTG.
15th October:      Our T-shirt is designed today. It is very pretty. See image below.
19th, 20th October:   We have a good discussion with USTC team in Hefei and they give us several important suggestions on experiments.
Our logo is designed finally. It is a visual field through a microscope. You could see us in this microscope.
Our iGem is coming to the end. But our projet will continue.
Of course, we encountered many obstacles and difficulties such as financial problems, cooperation and communication problems of teammates, spirit pressure, time management and so on. But all the hardship turned out to be a precious experience that helped us grow up. Anyway, iGem is one of our most precious experiences and we will never forget these days and night in the lab and meeting room, all the laughs and tears. We have learned a lot in this project except the attending the competition itself.
