Experiments & Protocols
Below you will find a comprehensive list of all the protocols we used during our wet lab work. We spent some time toward the start of the project sourcing and updating effective protocols for B. subtilis manipulation explicitly, as other teams have previously had difficulty in this area.
These protocols worked for us, so any future teams looking to use subtilis could save quite a bit of time by looking here before diving into the literature!
Protocols
1. Transformation Protocols for integration vectors in Bacillus subtilis
Protocol 1
Protocol 2
2. Transformation Protocol for E.coli
