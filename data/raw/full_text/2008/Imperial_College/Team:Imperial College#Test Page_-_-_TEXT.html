Our Team
Hey guys, welcome to the official Imperial 2008 iGEM Wiki. There are a couple of basic things  you'll need to know when editing this wiki (on top of the normal formatting and linking stuff!); these are mostly to do with the overall "theme" of the wiki (blue titles, navbar at the top, etc.). Basically, if you create a page the first thing you need to do is put {{Imperial/StartPage}} at the top of the page and {{Imperial/EndPage}} at the bottom - you can see the tags by clicking "Edit" on this page at the top. This applies a formatting template that'll put the navbar in, keep the theme consistent and format any calendars correctly. You then write in between those tags as normal. Remember to do this for every page!
If you get stuck or want to do something more complicated (like add a link into the Navbar) just ask me and I'll show you how. [:
