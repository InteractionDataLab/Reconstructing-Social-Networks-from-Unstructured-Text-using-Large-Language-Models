BioBricks Submitted
This year Imperial College has added 45 new parts to the Registry - 45 of those designed specifically for use in B. subtilis. In addition we sought to characterise some of these parts, including the constitutive promoter and ribosome binding site pveg-spoVG; you can find information about the characterisation of some of our parts in the Major Results page.
Shown below is the final construct we were aiming for - our light-sensing, clutch-engaging, biomaterial-producing biofabricator.
BioBricks Submitted to the Registry
The parts we have submitted to the Registry are shown in the table below; they can also be accessed here .
