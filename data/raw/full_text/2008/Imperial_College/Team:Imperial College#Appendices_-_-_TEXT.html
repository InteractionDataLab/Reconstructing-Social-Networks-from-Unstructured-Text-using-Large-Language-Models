Modelling Motility
Data extraction algorithm. Obtains motility properties from trajectory data
Generates trajectory based on generated parameters
Generates first run of the trajectory, to be called by modelfit1.m
Generates second run of the trajectory, to be called by modelfit2.m
Generates parameters for the first run of cell trajectory
Generates parameters for the second run of cell trajectory
Synthetic Video
Random Number Generator
Generation of Bacteria Shape Characteristics
Generation of Bacteria Motility Characteristics
Generation of Synthetic Video (Requires the above 2 files to run)
Probabilistic Methods
Plots the posterior of (μ,σ) for a normal distribution
Plots the posterior of λ for an exponential distribution
Modelling Growth
The growth of bacteria at a constant growth rate
Simulation of the Hill Function
Nutrient concentration and nutrient as a function of time, both plotted against time
The growth model (N.B. Here the concentration of nutrients with respect to time is assumed to follow the trend given by a piecewise function)
The growth model that fits the experimental data
M-file for generating a plot of results from wetlab
Excel spread sheet of Data from experiment + a log graph of experimental results
Modelling Genetic Circuit
ODE system describing constitutive gene expression
Simulation file for constitutive gene expression
ODE system describing simple model
Simulation file for simple model
ODE system describing more complex model
Simulation file for more complex model
PDF of working - simple model
PDF of working - complex model
Simulation file for modelling LacI repression of promoter before IPTG is introduced

Tutorials
The following are four tutorials which introduce us to data analysis and modelling. The tutorials are focused on the above approach. MATLAB codes used for data analysis can be found in the final link.
Dry Lab Tutorial 1: Design of a Motility Assay
Dry Lab Tutorial 2: Statistical Data Analysis
Dry Lab Tutorial 3: Testing the Tracking Software
Dry Lab Tutorial 4: Modelling the Growth Curve
