Our Team
For the 2008 iGEM competition, the Imperial College Team aims to develop a genetically-engineered Biofabricator, using the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis as our chassis. Our Biofabricator aims to produce self-assembling biomaterials in specified 3D shapes, using light as the trigger.
Pushed for time? Project Summary | Achievements | Growing Clothes: BioCouture
Overview
The following video is a simplified representation of how we want our system to work...
First by utilising an endogenous light-sensing mechanism, the bacteria is captured in the desired location using 3D holography.
Next bacterial locomotion is suspended in the region of interest using a recently-discovered clutch mechanism. This involves disengaging the flagellum from the motor protein.
Finally, when our bacteria are stationary in the correct location, the biomaterial production is triggered. These biomaterials can self-assemble to form a 3D bio-scaffold.

The Imperial College Team 2008 has received sponsorship from a number of generous companies. We are grateful for their kind support.
We would also like to thank the members of the Center for Structural Biology for their help and support during our iGEM project.
