Prologue - The Men of E
You've probably seen them yourself. Sitting around the lab, watching, waiting... You wondered why Eppendorf feel it necessary to include one with every centrifuge, but the truth, the truth is far more sinister.
They include themselves.
Journal
Day 1
Following a coup of the Imperial College Synthetic Biology Lab (SBL) while the wet lab team was... streamlining the iGEM presentation* at lunchtime, we were left with no choice but to barricade the doors and try and keep them in. We don't know why they turned against us, or why they chose now... We think they got Larry, but the rest of us made it out with superficial wounds.
* if by "streamlining the presentation" you mean "sneaking a quiet one in the pub"
Day 2
We need to see what's going on in there - if they are organised, there's no end to what nefarious creations they could concoct with the equipment they've got in the SBL. We'll need help from our friends in Engineering... The noises coming from the SBL, late into the night, they burn into your memory. Terrible noises...
Day 4
We've gotten hold of a small camera-drone, which we dropped into the room through the air vent. Now if we can keep it out of harm's way we can see what's going on...
Day 5
It seems they aren't as organised as we thought. It looks like there's infighting, they're turning on each other! Apparently, however, they're quite hardy... I've seen one killed at least twice over, only to repair himself with those weird, bendy, scarily flexible arms.
Reached right round and pulled his skull top back on. It was horrific...
Day 7
Making the best of a bad situation, and trying to raise a little capital for the repair of our poor lab, we've started taking bets on the beasts. Hey, all's fair in love and war, right? And we do love watching them fight...
These two suckers were fighting for a couple of hours, until victory was declared for, well, the one holding the rope in the picture...
I'd call that a pretty solid choke-hold. Little bugger netted us £125 from the punters! It'll go some way toward a new plate reader, I don't think the one we had will be usable (or if anyone will want to use it) after the... unspeakable things they did in there.
Day 9
The smiles, why are they always SMILING. Horrible grimaces... masking any pain or feelings of guilt... How can they do what they do to each other? HOW?! AND WHY THE SMILES!?!!?
