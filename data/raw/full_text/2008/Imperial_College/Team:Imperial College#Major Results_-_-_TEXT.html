Experimental Results
Major results are shown in this section; there's a brief description of each and you can click through to find more detail on them. For minor results, please refer to our Notebook.
Our Work With B. subtilis Chassis
Please click here for more information
B.subtilis has great potential as a chassis for synthetic biology. However it is not commonly used in iGEM competitions and very few B. subtilis BioBricks are available. In order to increase the accessibility of B.subtilis as a chassis, we have created 41 new BioBricks which are specific to B. subtilis. We have also successfully transformed it and characterised its growth.
Control of Motility
Please click here for the Motility Control Results Page
We studied the motility of B. subtilis and developed an elegant mechanical model to describe cell trajectory. We fitted our model to our laboratory data and discovered that our model matches cell trajectory data extremely well.
Characterisation of Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) gene
Please click here for the CAT gene characterisation page
We have characterised the ability of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( BBa_J31005 ) to provide resistance to chloramphenicol. Characterisation has revealed the range of chloramphenicol concentrations at which a cell will be protected by a single chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.
Characterisation of BioBricks
Please click here for the BioBricks Characterisation Summary Page
We have characterised several of our testing constructs in B. subtilis. This has shown that a variety of our parts are functional including integration sites, antibiotic resistance, promoters and ribosome binding sites.
General lab work and smaller results are put up on the calendar on the dates they were done; they can therefore be found in the >>> Notebook >>>
