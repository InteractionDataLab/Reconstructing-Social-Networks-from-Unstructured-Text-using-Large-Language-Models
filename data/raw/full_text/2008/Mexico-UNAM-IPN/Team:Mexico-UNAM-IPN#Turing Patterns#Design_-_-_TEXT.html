From 2008.igem.org
Back to Turing Patterns
Note: This project was finally left undeveloped and hopefully it will be completed next year.
The Scheme
We want to create Turing patterns by means of a genetic devise. Such patterns have benn succesfully generated by means of an oscillatory chemeical reaction such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky_reaction .
We plan to use BBa_I5611 , a devise similar to the Repressilator , that produces an oscillatory behavior in bacteria.  To couple the oscillators we plan to use cell free systems , this chasis will enable the repressors to freely difuse through the media.
From an homogeneous media with perturbances that create local points where the represors of Tet, Lac or Cl predominate. As they difuse through the media they may create wave fronts and eventually complex patterns.
