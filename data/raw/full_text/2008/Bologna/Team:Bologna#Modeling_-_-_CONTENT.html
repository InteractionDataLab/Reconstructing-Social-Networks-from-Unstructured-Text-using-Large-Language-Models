Scheme of the genetic Flip-Flop</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="text-align:justify"><P>The molecular circuit in Figure 1 can switch between two different stable states (LacI-ON and TetR-ON), driven by two external stimuli (UVc and IPTG). LacI-ON represents the stable state in which LacI gene is active and LacI protein represses  the TetR gene expression, with a positive feedback. Therefore, the LacI-ON state coincides with the TetR-OFF condition. On the contrary, the TetR-ON represents the state with the TetR gene active and the LacI gene silenced (LacI-OFF). Owing to the coexistence of two stable states (bistability), this circuit is capable of serving as a binary memory [Collins et al. 2000]. We denominated it  a Flip-Flop since it works as a <A href="/Team:Bologna/Modeling#SR_Latch" title="Team:Bologna/Modeling">SR Latch</A>: LacI state is the  output and TetR state is the  output. Uvc is the set signal and IPTG is the reset signal. Indeed, IPTG stimulation inhibits LacI repressor, thus can cause the transition from the LacI-ON state to the TetR-ON. UVc radiation, inactivating LexA repressor through the <A href="/Team:Bologna/Modeling#UV_Radiation:_SOS_system" title="Team:Bologna/Modeling">SOS response</A> [Friedberg et al. 1995] can cause the opposite transition from LacI-ON to TetR-ON.
The core elements of the genetic program are two mutually regulated promoters. The promoter transcriptional strength and the repressor binding affinity to the promoter determinate such relevant circuit properties as the bistability and the response to inputs. To quote the promoters in terms of strength and sensitivity to repressor we resorted to the following model-based analysis and <A href="/Team:Bologna/Modeling#Numerical_simulations" title="Team:Bologna/Modeling">numerical simulations</A>.

The Flip-Flop circuit in Figure 1 can be modeled by the following equations:
</P><P>Symbol definition is listed in Table 1.
</P><P>A common motif in repressor proteins is the presence of a dimeric nucleotide-binding site with dimeric structure. In accordance to this general structure the cooperativity coefficients () were assumed equal to 2. The maximum velocity of repressor synthesis () accounts for the strength of the unregulated promoter and RBS. The value of the affinity constant for the binding of repressor to the promoter strictly depends on the sequence of operator site (OS block).

The equations (1.1) and (1.2) can be written dimensionless:

</P><P>
To obtain these relations the UVc-dependent term in equation (1.4) was ignored ( ). This is justified by the high binding constant of LexA for its operator, and the consequent negligible contribution to the LacI synthesis.
Equations (1.6) and (1.7) can have one or three solutions that represent the equilibrium conditions of the circuit. The solutions, i.e. the equilibrium conditions, can be graphically identified as the intersections between  and   nullclines (see Figure 2). The case of multiple equilibrium conditions (bistability case) is shown in Figure 2 panel b. TetR-ON and LacI-ON are stable equilibria separated by the unstable one (saddle point). Due to the bistability the circuit can operate as a binary memory.  
The existence of a bistability condition depends on the value of  and    parameters. If  decrease (see Figure 2 panel a) a saddle-node bifurcation can occur, TetR-ON equilibrium vanishes and remain only the stable equilibrium LacI-ON.  The contrary occurs when  is decreased (Figure 2 panel c). Thus bistability is guaranteed only for a limited range of   and  values.

An analogous result can be obtained for the existence of the TetR-ON state. Thus, a sufficient condition for bistability is:

For this value the circuit is sufficently distant from the bifurcation lines to avoid random memory switching but it is possible to set (or to reset) the memory with proper stimulation.

Today, the term Flip-Flop has come to mostly denote non-transparent (clocked or edge-triggered) devices, while the simpler transparent ones are often referred to as <B>latches</B>; however, as this distinction is quite new, the two words are sometimes used interchangeably.
</P><P>A Flip-Flop is usually controlled by one or two control signals and/or a gate or clock signal. The output often includes the complement as well as the normal output. As Flip-Flops are implemented electronically, they require power and ground connections.
</P><P>Flip-Flops can be either simple (transparent) or clocked. Simple Flip-Flops can be built around a pair of cross-coupled inverting elements: vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors, field effect transistors, inverters, and inverting logic gates have all been used in practical circuits â perhaps augmented by some gating mechanism (an enable/disable input). The more advanced clocked (or non-transparent) devices are specially designed for synchronous (time-discrete) systems; such devices therefore ignores its inputs except at the transition of a dedicated clock signal (known as clocking, pulsing, or strobing). This causes the Flip-Flop to either change or retain its output signal based upon the values of the input signals at the transition. Some Flip-Flops change output on the rising edge of the clock, others on the falling edge.
</P><P>Our project simulates a SR Latch (Figure 11), the most fundamental latch, where S and R stand for set and reset. It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q (or the complement <SPAN style="text-decoration:overline">Q</SPAN>).
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:352px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 11. SR latch</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
Normally, in storage mode, the S and R inputs are both low, and feedback maintains the Q and <SPAN style="text-decoration:overline">Q</SPAN> outputs in a constant state. If S (Set) is pulsed high while R is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high when S returns low; similarly, if R (Reset) is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low when R returns low (Figure 12).
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 12. SR latch truth table</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
The R = S = 1 combination is called a restricted combination because, as both NOR gates then output zeros, it breaks the logical equation Q = not <SPAN style="text-decoration:overline">Q</SPAN>. The combination is also inappropriate in circuits where both inputs may go low simultaneously (i.e. a transition from restricted to keep). The output would lock at either 1 or 0 depending on the propagation time relations between the gates (a race condition). In certain implementations, it could also lead to longer ringings (damped oscillations) before the output settles, and thereby result in undetermined values (errors) in high-frequency digital circuits. This condition is therefore sometimes avoided.

The spectral range of ultraviolet radiation  is,  by definition, between 100  and 400 nm  and  is   invisible   to human  eyes.  The  UV spectrum is subdivided into three bands: UV-A (long-wave) from 315 to 400 nm, UV-B (medium-wave) from 280 to 315 nm, UV-C (short-wave) from 100 to 280 nm. A strong germicidal effect is provided by the radiation in the short-wave UV-C band.

After dimerization of two adjacent thymines blue light gives energy to photolyase to repair the damage</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>The maximum UV germicidal effect  coincides with the peak absorbance of DNA (near 260nm) due to the dimerization of two adjacent thymines.
E.Coli cells have a system that recovery DNA damage when it occurs. The best studied transcriptional response to DNA damage is the SOS response [Friedberg et al 1995, Walker et al. 1996].  
This systems can be divided into two class: the SOS Photoreactivation repair and the  SOS respond triggered by RecA protein. The first uses the photolyase, a poorly expressed enzyme(encoded by genes phrA and phrB)  which  binds the pyrimidine dimers and uses the blue light to split them apart as showed in Figure 13.
Otherwise single stranded DNA produced by several DNA-damaging agents can be bound by RecA protein, resulting in conversion of this protein to its activated form. The RecA repair system doesnât need light and Lexa protein controls the expression of 43 genes [Courcelle et al. (2001)]  that cooperate together to repair the extensive genetic  damage (Figure 14). RecA and LexA proteins play an important rule for the regulatory of SOS Recombination System.  A LexA binding site is present in all the SOS promoters genes' and it works as a repressor of SOS system. In presence of DNA damage (DNA Single Strains) RecA becomes active and interacts with LexA protein, the repressor of the SOS genes [Wagner et al., 1999] . This interaction triggers the autocatalytic cleavage of LexA and consequent destruction of its ability to function as a repressor, which results in the derepression of SOS genes [Mustard and Little 2000; Fernandez De Henestrosa et al. 2000]. When the damage is repaired, DNA single strains are not present in the cell and the RecA protein no longer promotes the auto-cleavage of the LexA which is restored to its initial repression level (Figure 15).</P><TABLE align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:270px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 14.
