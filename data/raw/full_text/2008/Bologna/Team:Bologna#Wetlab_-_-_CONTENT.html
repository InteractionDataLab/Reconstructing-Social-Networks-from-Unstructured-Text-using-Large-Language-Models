Operator sites as BioBricks!</SPAN></H1><P>Even though transcriptional regulation still plays a pivotal role in synthetic biology, a modular assembly of regulated promoters and the characterization of their properties has not been formalized, yet. At present state, each promoter in the Registry, though complex, is treated as a “standalone” monolithic element. Thus, the choice of a regulated promoter implies a prefixed sigmoid regulation curve. The only option, using the current BioBricks, is to choose a discretional scaling factor in the transfer of the transcription function to the protein through an appropriate RBS. Critically, the choice of one specific transcription factor limits the choice to just one possible promoter. The assembly of regulated promoters as the combination of modular parts, i. e. unregulated promoters and operators, could permit the rapid design of regulatory elements with fixed  characteristics. In fact, promoter transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity could be independently chosen. 
</P><P>A first step in the rationalization of promoter design was done in the iGEM 2007 with the introduction in the Registry of a family of constitutive promoters. Each family element differs from the others just for few base pairs in -35 and -10 regions, keeping constant the rest of the sequence and giving rise to a different level of transcription strength. We decided to use this valuable work as a platform for a deeper and more general promoter design strategy. To obtain regulated promoters we decided to combine these parts with short regulatory sequences that operate as a binding site for the transcription factor. To this aim, we synthesized four libraries of operator sequences, respectively for <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K079045" class="external text" rel="nofollow">LacI</A>, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K079046" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TetR</A>, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K079047" class="external text" rel="nofollow">cI</A> and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K079048" class="external text" rel="nofollow">LexA</A> repressor proteins (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K079045" class="external text" rel="nofollow">see details</A>). In each library, there are three sequences (see Table below) each with a different repressor binding affinity to the repressor protein. Since the libraries were synthetized on pGA18 and pMA Geneart vectors, we isolated each operator with the intention to clone them into BioBrick standard assembly plasmids. The choice of the operator should give a relative fine-tuning of promoter sensitivity to the repressor. We decided to take the Berkley's costitutive promoter library as a good &quot;collection&quot; from which we could select the unregulated promoter, according with the chosen transcriptional strength.

Single operators or a combination of them, can be also assembled upstream or downstream with respect to a constitutive promoter. In fact, it is known (Cox et al, 2007) that the position of an operator site plays a crucial role in determining repression effects (i.e. <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K079041" class="external text" rel="nofollow">lambda operators</A>). In particular, the same operator located upstream of the promoter -35 sequence functions as a weaker repressor than one located downstream of the -10 consensus sequence.

In fact, only Dna sequences down to at least 40 bp can be efficiently purified with the standard kits available. 
Small bands extraction requires laborious condition optimization and hazardous reagents like phenol-chloroform
So, we decided to set a new protocol up for the isolation and cloning of single operator sites into standard BioBricks plasmids. 
</P><P>We started from the analysis of an existing custom vector into the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_J23100" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Registry</A>. In this vector, a RFP gene was cloned, as a reporter, between the SpeI and PstI restriction sites. Thus, this is the only part in the Registry that can be separated from a plasmid with a S/P digestion. 
</P><P>Therefore, once the RFP is isolated with S/P, it could be assembled with an operator sequence digested SpeI- PstI, too. This could allow the isolation of the Operator- RFP sequence from the commercial plasmid and the subsequent religation into a standard plasmid. Then, a final extraction of the RFP gene with a SpeI- PstI digestion would leave the operator site inside the standard plasmid.
