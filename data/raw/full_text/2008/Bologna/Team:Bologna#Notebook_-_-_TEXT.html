Notes
Here's all our lab work: week by week you can find all the procedures, links to the registry of standard parts and protocols. The chronological structure of this section, organized as a notebook, mirrors the real development of our project and respects the pure iGEM style.

Week 14: from 10/20/08 to 10/26/08
Starting from our operator library, we need to extract every single operator to insert these in standard plasmids.
To achieve that we try some methods:
Agarose gel 3% for electrophoresis run: no results, the bands are too feeble and yield problem with QIA quick gel extraction kit . The spin columns are optimized for  parts ≥ 60bp.
Low melting gel 3% and extraction with Phenol Clorophorm: no results, complicated method and high toxicity.
