Our team
The leading idea behind our Ecoli.PROM team was to put in touch students with different curricula, ways to approach scientific problems and favour ideas exchange. These students, pushed by their common desire for new experiences, decided to participate in this exciting competition to discover a new research field and to expand their interest for synthetic biology. Responding to the call of Professor Silvio Cavalcanti, they constituted the Bologna iGEM team, finally composed of students from Biotechnology, Electronics Engineering and Biomedical Engineering faculties.

ECM Lab
The Igem2008 Bologna team worked in the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Engineering for the Study of Bionanosystems (ECM lab). The lab research is focused on the application of bionanotechnology. IGEM students found here the main tools to carry out the project. Libraries, study rooms and computer rooms were also available to gather brainstorming, Internet searches and any activity related to the project.

Our University
The origins of the University of Bologna are ancient: its foundation dates back to the year 1088, as it was conventionally established in the last century by a group of historians led by the Italian Nobel Laureate, Giosuè Carducci. Important scholars, writers, philosophers and poets such as Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarch, Guido Guinizelli, Cino da Pistoia, Cecco d'Ascoli, Re Enzo, Salimbene da Parma and Coluccio Salutati spent periods of study in Bologna during their life. At the moment the university counts 23 faculty, houses about 100000 students and has didactical head-quarters in Reggio Emilia and Imola and four scientific poles in Romagna, respectively in Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini. In addition afford a school of excellence, the Collegio Superiore and a detached head-quarter in Buenos Aires.
In Cesena , the birth of a university centre was probably connected to the foundation of the Collegio dei Giuristi (College of Jurists), which was a concession of Pope Julius II in 1504, but only in 1989 the first degree course was activated, thanks to the Cassa di Risparmio di Cesena, which has supplied through SER.IN.AR. S.p.a. (a company specifically founded for this purpose) the financial resources required to the creation of laboratories, a library and other educational infrastructures.
The new reality has then represented a significant example for a further development of the University of Bologna towards the Romagna territory, which had no university structures at the time. In the last decades, thanks to the commitment of the University of Bologna and to the contribution of local entities, the teaching offer of Cesena  has gradually expanded in accordance with the acquisition and the creation of new infrastructures for the location of classrooms, offices and high-tech laboratories.
In 2001, as a consolidation of this process, the Polo Scientifico-Didattico of Cesena  has been founded within the Multi-Campus Project of the University of Bologna: this is the scenery in which, in 2002, the II Faculty of Engineering was established. The Biomedical Engineering curriculum, which characterizes the new faculty, mirrors the economical reality of Emilia Romagna, which houses one of the most important disctricts of Biomedical devices design and manufacturing.

Giovanni Mariotta (Electronic Engineering for Biomedical Applications)
Giovanni Mariotta
Hi to everybody!
I was born in Ragusa (Sicily) 14th July  1982 and I live in Donnalucata, a  little but beautiful town near the sea. I obtained the first level degree in Electronical Engineering  in 2005 at the University of Catania. Now I’m attending the last year in Electronic Engineering for Biomedical Applications Master at the University of Bologna.
I love travelling around the world meeting new people, doing new experiences… in short… everything that can grow my spirit and myself.
I took part to iGEM experience because I consider that very stimulant and I’m interested in learning biobricks' philosophy.
