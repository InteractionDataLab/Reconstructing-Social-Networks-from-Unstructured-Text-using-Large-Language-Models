Gel extraction
Biosafety level: 2
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl).
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). To help dissolve gel, mix by vortexing the tube every 2-3 min during the incubation.
After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without  dissolved agarose).
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube or into a vacuum manifold.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min or apply vacuum to the manifold until all samples have passed through the column. Discard flow-through  and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
Recommended: add 0.5 ml of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min or apply vacuum. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min or apply vacuum. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
Centrifuge the column ina 2 ml collection tube (provided) for 1 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm).
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 30 μl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min and then centrifuge for 1 min.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.

Chemiocompetent cells
Biosafety level: 1
Take some colonies of DH5α cells from a fresh streaked plate and inoculate 125ml of Soc medium into a 2l flask.
Grow the cells overnight at 25°C (it is advised to grow them slowly in order to have them better synchronized). It takes approximately 20 hours. It is advisable to grow the cells at 25°C overnight and then to shift them at 37°C. Bacteria are ready for harvesting when OD600 is between 0.37 and 0.4. Higher OD will lead to less competent cells (it is important to harvest the bacteria when they are still in the logarithmic phase of growth).
Spin down the cells (at maximum speed) at 4°C for 10 min.
Re-dissolve the pellet in 40ml of Transformation buffer.
Incubate on ice for 10 min.
Spin down the cells (at maximum speed) at 4°C for 10 min.
