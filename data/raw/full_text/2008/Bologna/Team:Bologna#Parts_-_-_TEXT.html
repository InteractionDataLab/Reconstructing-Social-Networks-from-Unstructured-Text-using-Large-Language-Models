Composites
The table below shows all the composites that were obtained and use to build up our final device. For each part, it ispossible to find:
-the link to the Registry in the second column ;
-part components, in the third column ;
-in the fourth column the plasmid the part has been cloned in;
-in the fifth the insert length after double digestion with Xba1/Pst1 enzymes linked to the electrophoresis gel run;
-in the sixth column cell vitality after transformation;
-in the seventh column fluo data for each part.
