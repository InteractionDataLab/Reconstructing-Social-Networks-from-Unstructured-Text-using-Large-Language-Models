Gel for Plasmid Prep from Yesterday
Margaret
File:Plasmid prep.pdf
Plasmid Prep of pSB1A3, pSB1A2, pSB3K3, and a verification of pSMC121.
Biobrick Extraction
Margaret
extracted: I14032, pSB1A7, I51020, J23012 and transformed into DB3.1 cells. Plated on amp100. **the problem is that I14032 is Kan resistant. I introduced 1mM IPTG to the 2 hour 37°C incubation, but we will not see the results of this because of my antibiotics mix-up
on 7/24 there were 2 colonies on the pSB1A7 plate and 4 colonies on the I51020 plate, these were restreaked
on 7/25 the re-streaked plates were placed in 4°C.
Plasmid Prep pRL1383a-M
Krystle
200 ml prep of the new pRL1383 plasmid with biobrick multiple cloning site
Checked for transformants from yesterday/restreaked
Krystle
GFP + tt = 5 colonies
GFP fusion + tt = 15 colonies
nir + rbs = 1 colony
