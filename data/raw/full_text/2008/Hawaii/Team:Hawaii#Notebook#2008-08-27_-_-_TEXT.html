Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of p+r
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2.25 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digested DNA were loaded into each well.
Grace
Ran RE digested products on gel
nir had three bands. Band at ~730bp = ?
BB-pRL1383a -- still couldn't see cut out of GFP. Assumed double digest successful, too little DNA to see GFP.
J33207 wrong size
Extracted nir, C0012 vector, BB-pRL1383a from gel
3A assembly (ligation) of C0012 vector (pSB1A2) with:
nir and rbs (B0034)
plac and rbs(B0034)
pSB1A2 (negative control)
Transformed DB3.1 cells using 5 μl ligation reaction
Transformation
Margaret
ligation products from yesterday were transformed into DH5-a cells, pSMC121 was used as a positive control
rep+pSB1A3 (1:1)
rep+pSB1A3 (1:3)
rep+pSB1A3 (1:6)
P1 lytic +pSB1A3 (1:1)
P1 lytic +pSB1A3 (1:3)
P1 lytic +pSB1A3 (1:6)
[Plac B0030]+pSB1A3 (1:3)
[Plac B0030]+pSB1A3 (1:6)
[Plac B0034]+pSB1A3 (1:6)**ran out of vector
Sequencing
Gel of the pcr in preparation for sequencing, also colony pcr of rep and lytic regions.
Margaret
in preparation for sequencing, a PCR was run on the following plasmids:
oriV1-4, aadA(BB)5, aadA(BB)9, aadA(pRL)3, aadA(pRL)6, omega interposon
Note: In lane five, it looks like I added oriV instead of aada(BB)5. In the omega lane, there is a ladder. I will still sequence these.
Grace
Prepared nir+rbs and rbs+GFP constructs for sequencing
