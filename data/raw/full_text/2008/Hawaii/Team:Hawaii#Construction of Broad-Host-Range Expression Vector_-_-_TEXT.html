Construction of Broad-Host-Range Expression Vector from pRL1383a and Other Parts
This expression vector will pull parts from the RSF1010 derived broad-host-range plasmid pRL1383a, the self-transmissible plasmid RP4 and also from available BioBrick parts. These parts will be obtained through either PCR amplification from the original DNA, by synthetically constructing them as outlined in Silver's method for overlapping oligonucleotides, and finally through extraction from the BioBrick parts registry.
The obtained parts will then be maintained on seperate plasmids then later compiled onto the BioBrick Base Vector, BBa_I51020 . The mobility of this vector will be tested by first transforming into E. coli then conjugatively transferred to SynechocystisPCC6803, followed by the final test of cloning in genes and testing their expression in both E. coli and SynechocystisPCC6803.

Results
These genes were amplified from pRL1383a in all cases except for the P1 lytic region which will be amplified from a BioBrick plasmid: pSB2K3.

Discussion
Make Parts
I am making the parts several different ways: 1. PCR amplification, 2. synthetic construction of overlapping oligonucleotides, 3. extraction from BioBrick Registry.
PCR Amplification of pRL1383a
Each of these experiments can be found at the link above. This will include amplification products from other plasmids besides pRL1383a.
Oligonucleotide Assemby
The experiment and results can be found on the link above under the heading: "2 Construction of OriT from RP4 using Overlapping Oligonucleotides: Attempt 1"
Extraction of BioBrick Parts from Registry
Some parts were extracted from BioBrick registry, the experiments and results will be included in the link above.
Ligation of Parts
Experiments and results found in link above.
