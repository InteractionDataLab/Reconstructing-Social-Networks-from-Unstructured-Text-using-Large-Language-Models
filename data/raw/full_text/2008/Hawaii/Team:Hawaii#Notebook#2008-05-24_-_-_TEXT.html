Things we did today
Wetlab work
Made seed stocks
Margaret
five 10mL seed stocks of PCC6803 in BG-11 media
five plates smeared with 200uL PCC6803 in BG-11 media, all from old plates
Clumping Experiment
Margaret
Hypothesis: Liquid Cultures of PCC6803 clump when incubated in Erlenmeyer Flasks and does not when cultured in 'box' culture flasks: Is this due to the motion of the media in different containers, the surface area of the culture, is it reproducible?
Question 1: Does the clump go back to homogeneous when placed in square culture flask?
Test: Took 0.5mL of a clump and placed it in 2 square culture bottles. (1 of the bottles was fresh BG-11 media, the other was the old stock to which buffer was added today)
Compare to: Took 0.5mL of a homogeneous liquid culture and placed it in 2 square culture bottles. (1 of the bottles was fresh BG-11 media, the other 1 was the old stock to which buffer was added today)
Question 2:Will previously homogeneous culture go to clump?
Homogeneous liquid culture placed in BG-11 media in an Erlenmeyer flask 1:10, Vfinal=50 mL
Homogeneous liquid culture placed in BG-11 media in an Culture flask 1:10, Vfinal=50 mL
Discussion
What to do in the future:
The plates are drying out too soon so we need to make them 5mm thick instead of 3mm thick.
Get autoclave certification. We need to make media and autoclave hood materials: paper towels (?), eppendorf tubes, blocks, etc.
Get Pictures!
If our action is not recorded, we are doomed to either repeat the error, or fail to replicate the success.

Update on Seed Stocks
The seed stocks are forming a nice lawn on the media
Update on Clumping
The homogeneous culture is now clumping. Clumps are reverting to homogeneous
