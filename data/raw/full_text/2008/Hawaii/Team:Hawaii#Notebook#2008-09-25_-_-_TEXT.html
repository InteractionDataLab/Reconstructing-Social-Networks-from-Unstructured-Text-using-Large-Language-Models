Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of Ligation
Margaret
The plac/rbs+rep and oriTr(BB) transformations resulted in 0 colonies with the correct insert, so the remainder of the ligation reaction from 9/16 was digested with XbaI and run on a gel.
Sequencing & Colony PCR
Margaret
PCR
oriV colonies (3,4,6,8,9,10,11)
aadA(BB) colonies (4,5,7,8)
aadA(pRL) colonies (1,2)
oriT + J33207 (1,2,4)
oriT + J33207(de-phosphorylated) colony 1
5 additional colonies of oriTr transformation were PCR'ed
Construction of secretion device and redo of BB-pRL1383a (cont.)
Grace
EtBr stained 2% agarose gels ran at 60V for 1.5 hours and 2 hours, respectively. Thirty microliters of RE digested products were loaded into each well.
Ran RE digests from last night on gel
nrsg8 and nrg4 did not cut. Implies insert wrong?
Extracted bands from gel
Ligated:
3A using pSB1A3:
nrg7 + tt
rgt1 + nir
rgt1 + plac
rgt2 + nir
rgt2 + plac
pSB1A3 (control)
pRL1383a + J33207
pRL1383a to self (control)
Transformed into DH5α using 5 μl ligation reaction; also transformed J33207 and pRL1383a plasmids as control)
