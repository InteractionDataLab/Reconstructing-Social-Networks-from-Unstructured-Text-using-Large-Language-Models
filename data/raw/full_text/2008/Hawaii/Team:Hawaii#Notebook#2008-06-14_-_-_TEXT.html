Things we did today
Wetlab Work
Cell density test for PCC6803
Krystle
Plated 10-5, 10-7, 10-8 dilutions of PCC6803 (OD750 = .071 and 1.15) on BG-11
Plates in SC incubator
Glycerol stocked Biobrick colonies
Krystle
Combined 0.4ml 80% glycerol w/ 0.8ml of transformed E. coli grown overnight in LB + antibiotic
Cryostock could not be made for pUC18 because of contamination in overnight culture
Made competent cells
Grace
Same protocol as 6/2 competent cells
OD600 = 0.4567 (overnight culture)
OD600 = 1.1-1.2 (after CCMB80 added)
Triparental conjugation
Grace
Streaked BG-11+sp+sm plates with conjugates
Incubated in light & CO2 @ 30C in SC incubator
Discussion
For competent cells, should cool eppendorf tray at 4C. After aliquot, transfer tubes to -80C EtOH tray and freeze at -80C. GP suggests we aliquot with tubes in dry ice.
Was Callahan lab hood working?
