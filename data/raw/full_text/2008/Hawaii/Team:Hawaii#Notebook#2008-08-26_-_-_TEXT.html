Things we did today
Wetlab work
Ran RE digests on gel
Grace
Gel did not resolve. Bands were convex, poor separation between bands. Bad buffer?
Redid RE digests from yesterday
Used PCR products of nir and J33207
Inoculated for plasmid prep
Grace
BB-pRL1383a and J33207 in TB+amp100
Gel Purified
Krystle
Ran overnight ligation products on a 3% agarose gel
discussion: If we decide to do the 3A in two parts, we will have to re-restriction digest the first part before moving on
Transformation of ligated GFPf + TT
Krystle
Performed transformation protocol with DB3.1 and GFPf + tt ligation from 08/25
