Wetlab work
Construction of p+r and re-replacement of BB-pRL1383a MCS
Grace
EtBr stained 2% (L) and 0.8% (R) agarose gels ran at 60V for 2 hours and 1 hour, respectively. Thirty microliters of RE digest reaction were loaded into each well.
Ran RE digests from last night on agarose gel
C0012: correct vector band ~2.1kb
J33207: band at ~700bp (only one enzyme cut -- XbaI did not cut; PstI cuts because C0012 was cut by PstI) and ~850bp (uncut PCR product)
nir: ~800bp band (from GFP contaminant in plasmid prep, cut only once) and ~2kb band (??)
BB-pRL1383a: ran WAY too much product. Will redo RE digest with 20% of plasmid used. Since J33207 was only cut once, it's assumed BB-pRL1383a was cut only once as well.
Extracted C0012 vector band from gel
Ligated:
plac + rbs (B0034)
PCR of J33207
RE digested:
p+r with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI
J33207 and BB-pRL1383a with EcoRI and PstI
Treated C0012 vector (pSB1A2) with SAP
Construction of Broad-host-Range plasmid
