Initial Reading
Read Biobrick Technical Manual , don't worry about understanding every last bit of technical details.
Wiki By Example: Look at Harvard iGEM 2006 team lab notebook , get an idea with what they do in the lab on a daily basis. They worked with cyanobacteria as well, but did not transforming it. They ended up extracting genes from cyano- and transformed E. coli.
