Things we did today
Wetlab work
Restreaked nir+rbs and I14032+rbs constructs
Grace
Plasmid prep (finished up)
Grace
Resuspended plasmid preps in 50 μl TE buffer
Determined DNA concentrations of plasmids
Plasmid
DNA Concentration
nir
496.3 ng/μl
GFPf
484.8 ng/μl
BB-pRL1383a
508.0 ng/μl
Prep for sequencing
EtBr stained 4% agarose gel ran at 60V for 100 min. Twenty-five microliters of the PCR reactions were loaded into each well.
Grace
25 μl PCR reactions of nir+rbs, I14032+rbs, slr1, slr2, BB-pRL1383a
Colony PCRs seem to indicate success
25 μl PCR reactions of GFP+tt, GFPf+tt, J33207+tt
Colony PCR indicates no ligation. Picked new colony, sequence to confirm failure.
PCR of nir, B0015, B0030, B0034 for resequencing (bad reads last time)
Gel purified all PCR rxns (we still have a problem with contaminant DNA/shadow bands) and desired bands were extracted from gel
2% agarose gel ran at 60v for 2 hours
Determined DNA concentrations via nanodrop spectrometer
Prepared samples and sent to CORE Hawaii for sequencing
Construct p+r+g and p+r+s
Krystle
File:080808resdig.jpg
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 60V for 60 min. Forty microliters of each digest were loaded.
Restriction Digest
nir+B0030, I14032+B0030, J33207 digested with SpeI and PstI
gfp, gfpfusion, and B0015 digested with XbaI and PstI
Gel Purified restriction digest
2% agarose gel ran at 60 volts for 1.5 hours
40ul of the total restriction digest loaded into each well
gfpfusion cut out from gel
