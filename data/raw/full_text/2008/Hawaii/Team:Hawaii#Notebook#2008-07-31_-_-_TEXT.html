Things we did today
Wetlab work
Ligation of PCR products
Grace & Krystle
Ligated nir+rbs at 6:1 and 3:1 insert to vector concentrations (we didn't clean up RE digest so GP suggests higher vector concentration)
Ligated GFP+tt and GFPf+tt at 6:1 insert to vector concentrations (didn't have enough vector to do 3:1)
Ligated J33207+pRL1383a at 2:1 and 4:1 insert to vector concentrations
Transformed DB3.1 with ligated products
Grace
Ran a gel to check 7/30 gel
Krystle
Loaded 2 μl PCR product into each well
PCR tubes likely mislabeled
