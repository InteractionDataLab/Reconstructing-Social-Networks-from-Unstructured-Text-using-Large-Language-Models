Things we did today
Wetlab work
Restreaked BBpRL1383a construct
Grace
Looked at J33207+pRL1383a (BBpRL1383a) plates. 50 μl plate had blue colonies. Restreaked on LB+sp2.5+sm2.5 + X-gal
Inoculated for plasmid prep
Grace
Inoculated 200 ml TB+sp2.5+sm2.5 with blue colony. Incubated over the weekend at 37C with shaking at 250 rpm.
PCR verification of constructs
Margaret
20 colonies from each of yesterday's transformation were verified by PCR today using the VF2 and VR primers.
Construction of GFP secretion devices
Krystle
Checked for transformants:
nir+rbs+slr+gfpf
competent cells- none
commercial competent cells- 4
lac+rbs+slr+gfpf
competent cells- 1
commercial competent cells- 3
Colony PCR
nir+rbs+slr+gfpf colony 2 and colony 3 appear to be correct size
lac+rbs+slr+gfpf commercial cells colonies 1, 3, and competent cell colony appear to be correct size
Drylab work
Sequencing
Margaret
Results for plac/rbs(30)/rep(7) came in. The promoter and rbs were not present. The only discrepancies in the sequence were due to bad sequence and could be explained by overlapping sequences.
This construct is already ligated to oriV and the oriT/aada so next step will be to isolate that plasmid, digest with E,S and ligate the promoter and rbs in front. rbs (B0034) will be used because we have primers for this rbs and it can be easily verified.
