Things we did today
Wetlab work
Plasmid prep of BB-pRL1383a
Grace
E. coli did not grow. Reinoculated.
Extracted J04430 from filter paper
Grace
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Ten microliters of PCR product were loaded.
Used 2 μl of filter paper solution for PCR to verify plasmid
Something is wrong with the J04430 filter spot iGEM sent us. PCR with VF2/VR primers did NOT yield the expected band ~1000bp.
Transformation
Grace
Used 2 μl each of BBpRL1383a-1 and J04430 (from filter) to transform DB3.1
Construction of GFP secretion device
Krystle
Gel purify restriction digests from yesterday
Ligate nir+rbs and slr+gfpf into restricted psB1A3 from Margaret
Transformed into DH5α
