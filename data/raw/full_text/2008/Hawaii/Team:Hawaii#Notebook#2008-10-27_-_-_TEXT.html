Wetlab work
Triparental conjugation
Grace
Liquid and solid media cultures of triparental conjugation of Synechocystis. No growth was observed in any of the cultures.
Checked on triparental conjugation cultures from 10/13. No growth was observed in any of the cultures.
E. coli were grown at too low antibiotic concentration (sp2.5). Cells probably lost plasmid during growth, before conjugation. Will repeat triparental conjugation on Wednesday.

Grace
Used Qiaprep Spin Miniprep Kit to prep the rest of the BBpRL1383a liquid cultures.

Grace
