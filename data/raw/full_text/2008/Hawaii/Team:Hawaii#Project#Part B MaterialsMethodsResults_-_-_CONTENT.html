The first followed ligation and restriction digest <A href="/Team:Hawaii/Protocols" title="Team:Hawaii/Protocols">protocols</A> using full concentrations of annealed products. The second was a ligation and restriction digest carried out using 10<SUP>-1</SUP> dilutions of annealed product. It was suggested by Dr. Sean Callahan that if too much DNA was added to the ligation mixture, &quot;DNA hairballs&quot; would form between ssDNA (unannealed) and dsDNA, resulting in smears and multiple bands in the gel. The last method of construction simply placed equal concentrations of annealed products together. In theory, DNA overhangs would anneal appropriately, yielding an unligated but full promoter or signal sequence.</P><P>Ligation at full concentrations of annealed product worked best. The strongest bands were observed for this method. Multiple bands were still observed, above and below the expected band length (80-100bp) indicating both unligated DNA fragments and incompletely digested DNA or hairball structures. However, the strongest band for all three constructs corresponded to the desired product. The 10<SUP>-1</SUP> ligations were barely visible on the gel, and multiple bands were still observed, so ligation and restriction digest efficiency was not improved by the addition of less DNA. The last method of annealing but not ligating yielded two bands in the gel corresponding to the two original DNA fragments.</P><P>The purified DNA was then ligated to a Biobrick vector, <A href="http://www.partsregistry.org/Part:pSB1A2" class="external text" rel="nofollow">pSB1A2</A>, for subcloning in <I>E. coli.</I> Ligations were carried out using 3:1 molar concentrations of insert to vector.

Following standard PCR protocol, <A href="http://www.partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_E0040" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GFP</A> was converted into the fusion brick, GFP fusion.

While we aim to ultimately express our secretion system in this new plasmid as part of a cyanobacterial expression system, we needed a workable shuttle vector between <I>E. coli</I> (where constructs will be made) and PCC6803 (the ultimate host). Converting pRL1383a into a much simpler Biobrick plasmid fulfilled this requirement. Verification regions, transcriptional terminators, and the Biobrick multiple cloning site (MCS) was be isolated from the <A href="http://www.partsregistry.org/Part:pSB1A2" class="external text" rel="nofollow">plasmid (pSB1A2)</A>  containing BBa_J33207 via PCR. PCR primers also included <I>Hind</I>III and <I>Bam</I>HI restriction sites for ligation into pRL1383a. This ligation replaced the original pRL1383a MCS which includes Biobrick and Biobrick compatible restriction sites. The MCS replacement was verified by restriction digest and plasmid sequencing.
