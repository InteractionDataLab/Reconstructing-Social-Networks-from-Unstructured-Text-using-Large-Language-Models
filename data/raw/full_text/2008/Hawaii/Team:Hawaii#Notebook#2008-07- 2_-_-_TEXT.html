description
1
tri-dye ladder
very light, no difference in intensity
2
B0030
1.75kb, brighter than ladder, a lot of RNA
3
R0010
2.1kb, brighter than ladder, No RNA??
4
C0012
2.5kb, brighter than ladder, a lot of RNA
5
E0040
2.4kb, brighter than ladder, a lot of RNA
6
J33207
2.5kb, maybe 5.7ng/uL, No RNA??
7
rep region
0.5kb, 5.7ng/uL
8
(+) control
bright band below 0.5kb
9
(-) control
all clear
10
SigE
~1kb, maybe 5.7ng/uL
Future Work for this experiment
There is salt contamination in the plasmid preps. This is shown in the smeared bands. This occurred because the ethanol did not completely dry. We need to purify.
Remade seed stocks of cyanbacteria

Discussion
Use commercial-grade competent cells for E0240 and I14032 extraction? We really need these two Biobricks.
