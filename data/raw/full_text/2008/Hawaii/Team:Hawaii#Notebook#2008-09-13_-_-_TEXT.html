Things we did today
Wetlab work
Competent Cells
Margaret, Krystle, Norman
Today we made DH5-alpha competent cells. The first OD reading was between 0.3-0.4 for all three flasks. The OD after the last incubation with CMBD buffer was 1.1, 1.29, 0.8977, 1.079, and 0.942. (both of these OD readings are within the range we want.)
PCR
Margaret
oriT constuct from pSB1A2- for construction with J33207 for verification test
rep (pRL1383a)- to ligate to plac, B0030, and pSB1A3 and make a number of construct that can be sequenced with my new primers
omega interposon contruct from pSB1A2- to verify and sequence
oriV(pRL1383a)- to ligate to pSB1A3 and sequence next week.
(+) control pSB1A3 with VF2&VR
(-) control water with VF2&VR
