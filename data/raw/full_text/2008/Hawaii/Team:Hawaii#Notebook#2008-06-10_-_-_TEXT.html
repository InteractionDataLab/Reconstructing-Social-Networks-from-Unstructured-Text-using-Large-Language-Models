Things we did today
Wetlab work
Made LB+Kan50 plates
Grace
Made LB+Kan50 plates
Preparation for tri-parental conjugation
Grace
Streaked out DH5α transformed with pRL1383a on LB+sp for conjugation tomorrow
Streaked out E. coli transformed with RP1 on LB+kan for conjugation tomorrow
Biobrick extraction/transformation
Grace
Redid yesterday's BioBricks transformation using BBa_B0034, encoding a RBS. Gold standard super competent cells and pUC18 were obtained from GP for comparison of transformation efficiency with our competent cells. (see experiment)
Norman
Streaked out transformants from yesterday's BioBricks transformation/extraction
Drylab Work
Took cyanobacteria plates from PCC6803 transformation and PCC6803 cell density test to SC's lab for CO2 incubation
Got Anabena triparental conjugation protocol from SC
Found nifty paper on cyanobacteria proteins/gene location.
Discussion
Norman will figure out concentration of DNA on Biobricks filter paper
Norman will make LB+amp100 plates tonight
Need to check incubated plates tomorrow (Krystle?)
Need to create growth curve (OD750 vs. cell population)
Need to practice lifting agar for antibiotic insertion (Thursday?)
Quote of the Day
As long as you don’t know what it is, you don’t need to fill out forms.
