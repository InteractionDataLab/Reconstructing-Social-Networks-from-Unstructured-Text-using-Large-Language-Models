Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verified plasmid preps
Grace
PCR of plasmid preps from yesterday to verify inserts
Ran PCR products on gel
nrg #1 and nrsg #2 returned blanks. Bad plasmid prep?
BB-pRL1383a and colony PCR of BB-pRL1383a E. coli both blank. Yikes!
Quantified BB-pRL1383a and pSB1A3 plasmid preps
Blanks. Really low conc.? Will nanodrop to check.
Construction of secretion device (cont.)
Grace
Overnight RE digest:
nir, nrsg, and nrg PCR products with EcoRI and SpeI
rgt PCR products with XbaI and PstI
J33207 PCR product and pRL1383a plasmid with HindIII and BamHI
Prep for sequencing
Grace
nrg #4, nrg #7, nrsg #8, rgt #1, rgt #2
plac+rbs
PCR machine froze while ExoSAPing. Unable to retrieve samples from machine. Jamie says she will figure it out.
Making Emergency BB Vector Insert (help contaminant troubleshoot)
making x6 Parallel MCS Replacement fragmenets via PCR Redo!!! with clean uncontaminated primers download unannotated

Cross posted in 2008-09-23 for comparison with contaminated PCR gel run.
