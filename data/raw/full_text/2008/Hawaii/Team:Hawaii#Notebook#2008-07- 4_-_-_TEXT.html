Things we did today
Wetlab work
Hybridized and ligated nir, slr2016, pilA synthesis oligos
Grace & Krystle
Redid yesterday's hybridization and ligation
Used 10-6 dilutions of annealed products for agarose gel run and in ligations
Combined 1 μl each part, 7 μl nanopure water, 10 μl 2x Quick ligation mixture, and 1 μl Quick T4 ligase for ligation reaction. Incubated one set at room temperature, another at 40C for comparison.
Checked hybridization and ligation on 4% agarose gel (95V, 28 min.)
Gel turned out blank. Did not add enough DNA (used 10-6 dilution). Redo calculations and run gel again on Monday.
Reorganized Biobrick and plasmid cryostocks
