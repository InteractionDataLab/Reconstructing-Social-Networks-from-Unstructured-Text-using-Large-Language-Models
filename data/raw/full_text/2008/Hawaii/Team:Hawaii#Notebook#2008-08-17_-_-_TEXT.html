Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of transformants
Grace
EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 .5 hours. Five microliters of PCR reaction were loaded into each well.

X-gal did not work?
Colony PCR to verify insert
~320bp band is due to pRL1383a plasmid
BB-pRL1383a + J33207 bands are smaller than (-) control bands, potential success in replacing GFP w/ lac device
(-) bands due to contamination
Restreaked colonies to purify
Grew up colonies in TB+sp100 liquid media for plasmid prep on Tuesday
