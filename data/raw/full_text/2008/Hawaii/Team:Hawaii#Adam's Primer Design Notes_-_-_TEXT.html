Team:Hawaii/Adam's Primer Design Notes
From 2008.igem.org
Below are my notes on how a biobrick primer must work in detail, and how they must be constructed.  Silver lab and the Paris team have very similar methods for primer construction.  My prefix and suffix sequences are Silvers, but they are exactly how they should be put on the 5 prime end of the primer.  Someone should check, but I think this is it.
