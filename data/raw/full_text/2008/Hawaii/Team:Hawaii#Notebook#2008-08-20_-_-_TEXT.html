Things we did today
Wetlab work
Name of Task
Annealing was quite successful in that there is only one BRIGHT band.
Margaret & Krystle
Annealed and phosphorylated:
plac (I14032) for front ligation
rbs 1.0 (B0034) for back ligation
rbs 0.6 (B0030) for back ligation
rbs 0.6 (B0030) for front ligation
tt (B1006) for back ligation
We decided to perform this reaction again with out gel purification and the gel was discarded.
These annealed products can be found in the -20°C freezer in the DNA box.
Quantification was achieved simply by adding up the amount of DNA added.
plac (I14032) for front ligation --> 370ng/ul
rbs 1.0 (B0034) for back ligation --> 206.7ng/ul
rbs 0.6 (B0030) for front ligation -->
rbs 0.6 (B0030) for back ligation --> 228.3ng/ul
tt (B1006) for back ligation --> 375ng/ul
Restriction Digest
Krystle
B0034 with EcoRI and XbaI (for ligation with plac)
nir with SpeI and PstI (for ligation with RBS)
gfp wih SpeI and PstI (for ligation with TT)
gfp with EcoRI and XbaI (for ligation with RBS)
