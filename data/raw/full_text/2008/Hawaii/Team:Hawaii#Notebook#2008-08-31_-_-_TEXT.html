Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of p+r (cont.) and re-replacement of BB-pRL1833a MCS
Grace
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 60V for 1.5 hours.
Ran RE digests from last night on gel
plac+rbs band not visible; will ligate using plac and rbs parts (instead of plac+rbs part)
Image to right has been edited w/ Photoshop. Faint smear for plac+rbs was not visible before.
Extracted bands from gel
Ligated:
plac and rbs (B0034) and C0012 vector
J33207 and BB-pRL1383a
Transformed into DH5α cells
Plated BB-pRL1383a+J33207 on selective media with and without IPTG to verify if IPTG is necessary for blue/white screening in this strain
Inoculated TB+sp100 with BB-pRL1383a
Grace
Construction of Broad-Host-Range Plasmid Parts
Margaret
File:Re digest 8 31 08.jpg
Restriction digest of rep and P1 lytic regions.
gel of yesterday's re-digest, lane 3 was cleaned using gel purification spin columns and stored in -20°C. Lanes 7-10 were extracted and cleaned as well.
Ligation: using T4 ligase, 10X buffer (from the same lot as the enzyme, it was aliquoted today). 2 hour incubation at room temperature. The reaction was placed in 4°C in case transformation does not yield colonies.

1 pSB1A3 cut with X,P(de-P042-)18ng
3 rep (PCR product) X,P 82ng
1pSB1A3 cut with X,P(de-P042-)35.6ng
3P1 lytic region X,P 64.4ng
3pSB1A3 cut with X,P(de-P042-)66.2ng
1 rep (PCR product) X,P 33.8ng\
Transformation: of ligation products from today into DH5-alpha cells. Everything plated on Amp100 LB plates, pSMC121 used as positive control (plated on SmSp).
Plasmid Prep: stored in -20°C in 30ul TE buffer
Culture: 5mL Terrific Broth + amp100
