Team:Hawaii/Procols/DNA ligation
From 2008.igem.org
Protocol
Combine 4 ul of construct one with 4 ul of construct 2.
Add 1 ul of nanopure H20.
Add 10 ul of 2x quick ligation reaction Buffer.  In order to avoid shearing the DNA, mix by resuspending very slowly.
Add 1 ul of Quick T4 DNA ligase and mix thoroughly by resuspending very slowly.
Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Cool on ice then transform, or store at -20oC
Notes:
Adjust amount of DNA as necessary. For ligation of 2 pieces of DNA, use 1:1 ratio of parts. For ligation of insert to vector, use 3:1 ratio of insert to vector. ~180ng of DNA can be ligated using the above protocol.
Reference: Quick Ligation Kit from NEB.
The Endy lab recommends using ~10 ng vector in a reaction of with 6:1 ratio of insert to vector. Total DNA concentration should not exceed 100ng for maximum ligation efficiency.
