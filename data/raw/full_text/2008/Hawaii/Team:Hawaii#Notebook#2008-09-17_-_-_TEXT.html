Things we did today
Wetlab work
Quantification of plasmid preps
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 60V for 1.5 hours. Ten microliters of plasmid prep were loaded into each well.
Grace
Ran plasmid preps on gel to quantify
3A: nir+rbs+slr1+GFPf, 3A: nir+rbs+pilA+GFPf13 #8 not visible
Will run PCR later this week to verify there is plasmid (template)

Need lots of plasmid to do re-replacement of MCS. Will redo as large scale plasmid prep later this week.
