Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of parts
Krystle
Colony PCR of nir+rbs, gfp+tt, gfpfusion+tt transformants
Ran 3% gel for colony PCR reactions and plasmid preps of nir, slr1, slr2, pilA, GFP fusion, pRL1383a, B0015, and J04430.
Plasmid prep
Krystle
Inoculated 7 ml LB+amp with transformants for plasmid prep of nir+rbs, gfp+tt, gfpfusion+tt tomorrow
Drylab Work
Sequencing
Grace
Aligned and checked sequences received from CORE Hawaii for DNA sent in last week
Added BioBrick parts to registry
Grace
Added BB-pRL1383a , nir , pilA , slr2016 , and GFP fusion parts to BioBrick registry
Discussion
Sequencing for J33207 returned the sequence for E0026 (not sequenced). Need to run all plasmid preps of these two BioBricks on a gel to verify plasmid preps are properly labeled.
