Things we did today
Wetlab work
Oligonucleotide experiment , continued
Grace
Ran overnight RE digests of pRL1383a and BBa_C0012 on EtBr stained 2% agarose gel at 95V for 1 hour
BBa_C0012 vector okay
pRL1383a vector band ~9kb; no band observed at ~350bp. RE did not cut?
Gel purified pRl1383a, BBa_C0012, GFP fusion, and Biobrick segments
Used nanodrop spectrometer to determine DNA concentration (below)
Ligated 7 μl Biobrick segment with 0.5 μl pRL1383a and 7 μl GFP fusion with 2 μl BBa_C0012 vector in 20 μl ligation reactions
Transformed DH5α using 10 μl ligation reactions
Plated GFP/C0012 vector on LB + amp100
Plated BB segment/pRL1383a on LB + sp100
Counted colonies from yesterday's pnir, slr2016, pilA assembly transformation (see experiment )
Colony PCR'd colonies to verify presence of desired products
Transformation
Margaret
Transformation of DB3.1 competent cells pSB3K3, pSB1A2, pSB1AK3, (+)pUC18, (-) no plasmid, because transformation from 7/14/08 yielded only 1 colony from pSB3K3, nothing from pSB1A2 & pSB1AK3.
Plasmid prep
Krystle
Resuspended yesterday's plasmid prep in 100 μl TE and stored in -20C
Ran plasmid preps on gel to verify
Grew up pnir, slr2016, and pilA transformants in LB in preparation for plasmid prep tomorrow
Restriction Digest
Krystle
RE digested BBa_B0034, BBa_B0024, and BBa_E0040 with XbaI overnight
