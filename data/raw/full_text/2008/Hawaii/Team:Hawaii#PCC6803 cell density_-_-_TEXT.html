Abstract
We would like to correlate OD750 with specific cell densities (# cells/ml)
Protocol
Plated 200 μl of 1, 10-1, 10-2, 10-5, 10-7, and 10-8 dilutions of PCC6803 on BG-11.
Incubated at 37C with illumination in the SC lab for 12 days.
Results
Cell density of PCC6803
Concentration
OD 750 = 1.159
OD 750 = 0.071

Cell density was determined using the 10-5 colony count as it was the only statistically significant number (30<x<300).
Cell density for OD750=0.071 was approximately 2.40 x 107.
Cell density for OD750=1.159 was approximately 6.65 x 107.
