Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of transformants
Grace
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Ten microliters of PCR product were loaded into each lane.
Colony PCR of restreak plates
Bands ~600bp. Plasmid did not cut.
File:101308REdigest.jpg
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digested plasmid were loaded into each lane.
Krystle
RE digest of plasmid w/ EcoRI and PstI
RE digest of prpgt, rgt1 plasmids with EcoRI and PstI
Ran RE digests on gel
Bands did not correspond to what was supposedly loaded
Grace
PCR of prpgt #5, 7, 11, nrsg #6, rgt #1
Overnight RE digest of devices with EcoRI and PstI and rgt#1 with XbaI and PstI
Triparental Conjugation
Triparental conjugation plates. RP1, BB-pRL harboring E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 plated on 5% LB + BG-11 and incubated for 60 hours at 37C with 2% CO2
Grace
Restreaked 5%LB+BG-11 plates onto BG-11+sp2.5+sm2.5 plates for isolation of cyanos
Inoculated BG-11+sp2.5+sm2.5 liquid media with conjugated E. coli/cyanos
Incubated at 37C with 2% CO2 for 11 days. Liquid cultures were shaken at 100 rpm also.
