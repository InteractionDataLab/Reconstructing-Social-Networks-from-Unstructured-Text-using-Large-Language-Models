Things we did today
Wetlab work
Antibiotic test
Grace
Ran HindIII/BamHI digested J33207 on gel
Extracted from gel
Ligated with HindIII/BamHI digested pRL1383a
Used 5 μl ligation reaction to transform 100 μl DH5α MCR cells (from Doug in SC lab)
Also transformed 25 μl DH5α MCR with 2 μl BB-1 1025 and 1 μl J33207 each.
Plate of BB-pRL1383a/K125820 transformants under blue light.  Only some of the colonies appear to fluoresce and the smaller colonies do not show well in the picture.
Checked for Transformants
Krystle
BB-pRL1383a/K125820 produced a total of 27 transformants of varying size after incubation for 20 hours at 37oC
Inoculate for Tri-Parental Conjugation
Krystle
Inoculated 10ml cultures of LB with
BB-pRL1383a with sp100
BB-pRL1383a/K125820 with sp100
RP1 with kan50
Drylab Work
Project page
Grace
