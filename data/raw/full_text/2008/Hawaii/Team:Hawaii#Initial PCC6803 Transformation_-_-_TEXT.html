Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
Protocol by Arizona State University
Grow Synechocystis on BG-11 + glucose medium to OD730 = 0.5.
Transfer 1.5 ml of culture to a sterile microcentrifuge tube.
Spin cells at 7000 rpm for 2 minutes in a balanced microcentrifuge.
Remove supernatant by pipetting.
Add 200 µl of fresh BG-11 medium to the cells and resuspend cells.
Add 2 µl of the [our] plasmid and shake the tube several times.
Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Place a sterile filter on top of an agar plate that contains BG-11 + 5 mM glucose (50 ml per plate because it will take a long time for colonies to appear). Plate the cell suspension on the filter, spread it, and let it dry. The plate will be incubated in the light at 30 °C. The filter will be transferred the next day to a BG-11/glucose plate that contains [antibiotic].
Questions
Concentration of plasmid?
Temperature for growth in step 1? Light conditions?
Plate how much cells?
Use how much antibiotic?
Some possible answers from Mermet-Bouvier-CM-1993
Antibiotics added under the agar plates (I don't know why they add under the plate, perhaps some of the antibiotics are too heat sensitive) to a final concentration of: 10ug/mL Chloramphenicol, 50ug/mL Kanamycin, or 5ug/mL streptomycin.

Protocol by Shao, et al
Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 cells was grown routinely in BG-11 liquid and solid media at 30oC with constant illumination (25 μmol photons m−2 s−1 from cool-white fluorescent lamps) to OD730 = ~0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh BG-11 medium at a density of 109 cells/ml and transformated immediately.
Plasmid DNA (1 μg plasmid in 10 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.5]) was added to 1 ml of cells, gently mixed, and incubated for 1 hour without agitation at 30oC with illumination.
Cells were spread on 50-ml BG-11 agar plates (0.1 ml per plate) and incubated under illumination for 2 days at 30°C. At this stage, the appropriate selective agent (kanamycin) was added by lifting the agar slab with an ethanol-flamed spatula and dispensing 50 μl of a solution containing kanamycin (10 mg ml−1) underneath. After 14 days, transformant colonies were isolated and purified by restreaking three times in the presence of antibiotics as above.

Protocol used
Grew PCC6803 to OD730 = 0.2 and 1.5 (ideal is OD730 = 0.5-0.8)
Transferred 0.75ml cells to sterile eppendorf tube
Centrifuged 8 min @ 7000g for 8 minutes at room temperature. OD=1.5 sample was centrifuged for an additional 2 min @ 1000g.
Cells were resuspended in 100 μl BG-11
Incubated at 30C w/ illumination (36 μl photoms m2 s2 for 1 hour
Added 1 mL BG-11
Incubated at 30C w/ illumination for 2 days
Plated 0.1 ml cells on  BG-11 + spectinomycin + streptomycin plate
Original cell density determined by plating 0.2 ml 1/1, 1/10, 1/100 dilutions of cells on BG-11 plates.
PCC6803 is not naturally resistant to sp + st.
PCC6803 (not transformed) on BG-11 + sp + st media. No colonies were detected after 8 days.
Results
FAILED. No transformants were detected after incubating in the presence of CO2 at 37C for 18 days. Dots observed are moisture droplets reflecting light.
Transformation plates w/ sp+sm selection.
Discussion
Althought Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is naturally competent, plasmids that cannot homogolously recombine are not retained. Transformation is not an effectively way to introduce exogenous DNA into PCC6803.
