From 2008.igem.org
Protocol
Pick a colony and suspend in 200 μl LB (or other appropriate media).
Vortex ~8 sec.
Heat at 97C for 10 min.
Vortex again briefly.
Use 1 μl in PCR reaction.
PCR reaction
Combine:
1 μl colony sample (above)
0.5 μl 10mM forward primer
0.5 μl 10mM reverse primer
3 μl nanopure water
5 μl Taq (we used EconoTaq Green Taq)
Run for 30 cycles of denaturing, annealing, extension
Initial denature @ 94C for 2 min.
Denature @ 94C for 30 sec.
Anneal @ 62C for 30 sec.
Extend @ 72C for 90 sec.
Final extension @ 72C for 10 min.
Hold @ 4C inifinitly.
Run PCR products on a gel to verify desired DNAs.
