Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of Transformants
Grace

EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Two microliters of PCR product were loaded into each well.

Triparental Conjugation
Grace
Began triparental conjugation between E. coli containing RP1 and BBpRL1383a -1 or -18 and Synechocystis
RP1 OD600=0.6341
BBpRL1383-a OD600=61.25
BBpRL1383a-18 OD600=0.4884
Synechocystis OD700=0.8629, OD730=0.7337
Placed plates in SC 37C CO2 incubator until Monday
Verification of plasmids
MARGARET
Verification of plasmid preps and digests.
Why haven't I gotten good efficiency of transformation? I ran a gel of the plasmids i am working with and got the answer. Apparently there was a mix-up and I was using low quality plasmid.
The pSB1A3 and pSB3K3 digested and de-phosphorylated (lanes: ) were thrown out. Norman's pSB1A3 and pSB1A7 were digested with E and P today at 4:30pm.
The base vector is digested--> bands appear to be correct size.
Submitted sequencing
Margaret
the plac/rbs/rep colony 7 construct and oriV colony 1 (from most recent transformations) were sent in for sequencing today.
