Things we did today
Wetlab work
Colony PCR
PCR verification of aadA from pRL1383a using wrong conditions.
File:Rep P1 omega colony pcr.jpg
PCR verification of rep, P1 lytic regbion, and omega interposon ligation from 8-13
Margaret
5 colonies of rep, P1 lytic region, and aadA(pRL1383a) region, each. pSB1A3 was used as a control.
I changed the annealing time to 3min 30 seconds instead of the extension time, so the sites were not amplified properly. I ran the aadA(pRL1383a) construct on a gel and got a few bands, none of which were the right size. One of them should have been right though, so I am assuming this ligation did not work.
I ran another PCR verification on rep, P1, and the omega interposon and afterwards a gel.
Krystle
Krystle update
Culture
Margaret
Plasmid preps from yesterday did not yield very high quantities. I am setting up the culture for oriV1-4 and aadA(BB) 4 so I can do another plasmid prep tomorrow.
Krystle
Inoculated for plasmid prep of GFPf and J04430 tomorrow.
Restriction Digest
Margaret
digest of I14032 with SpeI and PstI. I want to use this to ligate to the aadA(BB) construct.
Grace
Checked Krystle's RE digests from last night on a gel
Also ran J33207 PCR product on same gel
Excised J33207 and GFPf bands from gel
RE digested:
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 72V for 1.5 hours. Thirty microliters of the RE digests were loaded into each well. BB-pRL1383a was digested with EcoRI/PstI. Picture is mislabeled.
J33207, J04430, BB-pRL1383a with EcoRI and PstI
pRL1383a, J33207 with HindIII and BamHI (Roche, from SC)
BB-pRL1383a with HindIII and BamHI (from lab -20C)
Ran RE digests on a gel to purify segments of interest
Also ran RE digested B0015 from Krystle
Gel extraction
Krystle
Used Epoch Biolabs kit to extract J33207 and GFPf DNA from agarose gel
Drylab Work
Sequencing
Margaret
Verified sequence of oriT, inserted into pSB1A2. The sequences of oriT and the BioBrick sites are correct.
Oligonucleotide Design
Margaret & Grace
We are having trouble with TT, RBS and Promoter ligations, so we decided to synthesize these parts.
B0016, I14032, B0030, & B0034
Discussion
Gel box 1 is the only one that works properly. The unlabeled gel box and box #2 may cause gels to run excessively slow, bands to blur/smear, or other weird things. Amps is really low on these boxes. All covers/power sources are good.
