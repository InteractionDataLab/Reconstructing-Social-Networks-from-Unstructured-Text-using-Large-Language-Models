</LI><LI> The vector will be de-phosphorylated in most cases to prevent self-ligation. As a negative control, this de-phosphorylated vector will be self ligated. 
</LI></UL></DD></DL><P><STRONG> Transformation </STRONG></P><DL><DD><UL><LI> The 3-way ligations usually involve the replacement of the ccdB gene with the insert, so DH5-alpha cells are used for transformation-- any plasmids not containing the correct insert, but containing the original (ccdB) will die in DH5-alpha.
</LI><LI> For the last ligation involving the Base Vector and the insert, DB3.1 cells will be used because the ccdB gene will not be replaced.
</LI><LI> Positive controls will usually be pUC18 to verify that the competent cells used are transformable.
</LI><LI> Negative controls will usually be the competent cell with no plasmid added.

</LI></UL><P>There is some non-specific binding in the lower kb region, but there is a band (*) that is around 5.2 kb. In the lane directly below this, the same colony was verified using the VF2/VR_B0034 primers. We would expect a band about 200 bp verifying the rbs located in front of the rep genes and a band at around  1 kb verifying that the aadA region has an rbs in front. This is verified by a positive control: the [promoter/rbs/aada] construct in pSB1A3 in a colony, pcr amplified with VF2/VR_B0034 primers. Both of these regions should be the same size because the amplification region should be the Forward verification region (158 bp) + the promoter (~60 bp) = 218 bp. The aadA regions was not amplified in this case, but due to the shortage of colonies containing results near what was expected, this colony, along with the colony designated with 3 * were cultured and plasmid prepped.
