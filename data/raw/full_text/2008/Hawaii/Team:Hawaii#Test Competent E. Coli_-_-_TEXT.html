2 Test Competent DB3.1 Cells
Test Competent E. coli DH5a
Test our competent cells against Callahan competent cells
Competency was chemically induced by RbCl
Methods
Materials
Transported 50uL of competent cells from Callahan Lab on ice
100uL batch 1 competent cells made at OD600 ~0.6 (split into two 50 uL aliquots 4-18a,4-18b)
100uL batch 2 competent cells made at OD600 ~0.3 (split into two 50 uL aliquots 2-17a,2-17b)
Procedure
Thaw plasmid on ice
Add 1uL plasmid pBluescript
Incubate plasmid + competent cells on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock 60 sec at 42C
Add 250 μl SOC
Incubate at 37 C for 1 hour in 2 ml eppendorf tubes, with shaking (150 rpm)
Plate 20 uL dilutions 1/1, 1/10, 1/100 on LB+amp to test competency

Notes:
1 Fewer than 30 colonies results in a statistically inaccurate estimation of cell density. CFU should be between 30 and 300.
2 Colonies formed in one quadrant (88) were counted and multiplied by 4 to give final cell density.
3 Positive control was plated on plain LB plates, without amp.

Row 4: 4-17 and 2-15 cells positive and negative controls
Batch 3
Discussion
Next time, remember to aliquot out and transform only 50 ul of the competent cells.
Number of transformants do not appear to differ between cells grown to OD600=0.3 and OD600=0.6 prior to induction of chemical competency
Callahan lab cells appear 10 times more competent. Did he start with more competent cells (higher cell density)? Does exponential growth of E. coli seed stocks at 23C (Callahan cells, recommended protocol) result in higher competency than growth of E. coli at 37C (our cells)?
Test Competent DB3.1 Cells
These cells were made on 7/11/08 with this protocol .
Competency was tested during a transformation from 7/14/08 .
Procedure
Thaw plasmid on ice
Add 2uL plasmid pUC18
Incubate plasmid + competent cells on ice for 10 minutes
Heat shock 60 sec at 42C
Add 200 μl SOC
Incubate at 37 C for 2 hour in 2 ml eppendorf tubes, with shaking (235 rpm)
Plate 250 uL dilutions on LB media
Results
The pUC18 transformation yielded a lawn while the (-) control yielded no colonies, verifying that DB3.1 competent cells can take up foreign DNA.
The day after transformation. (+) control pUC18 yielded a lawn, the (-) control yielded no colonies. The results of the other transformations are included else where.
