Effect of Water Motion on Clumping of Liquid Cultures
Hypothesis
Liquid Cultures of Synechocystis PCC6803 clump when incubated in Erlenmeyer Flasks and does not when cultured in 'box' culture flasks: Is this due to the motion of the media in different containers, the surface area of the culture, is it reproducible?
original clumping observation on 5/5/08
Methods
1. Question 1: Does the clump go back to homogeneous when placed in square culture flask?         1. Test: Took 0.5mL of a clump and placed it in 2 square culture bottles.          (1 of the bottles was fresh BG-11 media, the other was the old stock to which buffer was added today)         2. Compare to: Took 0.5mL of a homogeneous liquid culture and placed it in 2 square culture bottles.          (1 of the bottles was fresh BG-11 media, the other 1 was the old stock to which buffer was added today)    2. Question 2:Will previously homogeneous culture go to clump?         1. Homogeneous liquid culture placed in BG-11 media in an Erlenmeyer flask 1:10, Vfinal=50 mL         2. Homogeneous liquid culture placed in BG-11 media in an Culture flask 1:10, Vfinal=50 mL
Results
The homogeneous culture is now clumping. Clumps are reverting to homogeneous
Conclusions
This is a good way to get out cultures to clump if that is ever needed.
Discussion
If our action is not recorded, we are doomed to either repeat the error, or fail to replicate the success.
History is the only laboratory we have in which to test the consequences of thought. - Étienne Gilson
