Things we did today
Wetlab work
Transformation
Margaret
pSB3K3 was restreaked yesterday , and today I am growing them up in LB media in preparation for a plasmid prep.
checked transformants from yesterday . The controls came out as expected (positive: lawn, negative:lawn(oops, i didn't add selection to the plate)), neither pSB3K3, pSB1A2, nor pSB1AK3 transformed.
I extracted pSB1A2 & pSB1AK3 today with 7uL TE. All 7uL was used to transform DB3.1 cells again.
OriT Ligation
Last night, I digested the oriT  ligation with PstI, left it overnight. This morning, I stopped the digestion, precipitated the DNA and stored it in TE in the -20C freezer. The protocol can be found here .
