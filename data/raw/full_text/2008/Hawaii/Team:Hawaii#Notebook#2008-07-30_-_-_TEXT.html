Things we did today
Wetlab work
Restriction Digest
Grace
EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel. Twenty microliters of the restriction digest reactions were loaded into each well. Gel ran at 59V for 1.5 hours.
Digested 5 μl GFP, GFPf, and nir PCR products with EcoRI and SpeI
Sequentially digested 10 μl pRL1383a and 5 μl J33207 PCR product with BamHI and HindIII
Used Roche enzymes and Roche buffer M (buffer B also works) from SC
Ran digests on gel
pRL1383a and J33207 bands good (excised)
GFP, GFPf, and nir bands still too big
Krystle
Digested 10 ul each of GFP, GFPf, and nir PCR products from Grace's PCR on 07/30/08 with EcoRI and SpeI
PCR
Grace and Krystle
Redid yesterday's PCR of GFP, GFPf, and nir
Reran on gel, producing almost identical results.  Bands were excised.
Gel Purification
Grace
Purified B0030 and B0024 from gel
B0030 = 21.9 ng/μl
B0024 = 5.7 ng/μl
Krystle
Purified restricted pRL1383 and J33207 from gel
Purified Grace's PCR products of GFP, GFPfusion, and nir from gel
Why are bands still ~1kb and ~1.2kb?
Plasmid Prep
Krystle
Maxiprep of pRL1383a
PCR amplification of pRL1383a
Margaret
PCR amplification of oriV, aada, rep.
ran a gel from yesterday's PCR amplification of oriV, aadA, and rep regions.
Mini-Prep
Margaret
Plasmid Prep of BBa_I51020 , pSB1A7 , BBa_B0015
Colony PCR
Margaret
A colony PCR verification of BBa_I14032 , a lac Promoter and the oriT construct.
verify the insert of the oriT construct and BBa_I14032
Results:
BBa_I14032 should be 334bp, the band under 0.4kb indicating a verification of this size of insert.
oriT should be about 415bp(+BioBrick ends), the band is around 0.4kb so is in approximately the right place.
Discussion: The a plasmid prep and glycerol stock of both will be made. I need to verify the oriT part through sequencing.
Discussion
The gel purification kit is almost out of PE. If we need more before our order comes in, there is PE in the Qiaprep  Spin Miniprep kit (just remember to add EtOH before use).
