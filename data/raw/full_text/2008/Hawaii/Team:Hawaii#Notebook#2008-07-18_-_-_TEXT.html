Things we did today
Wetlab work
PCR of pRL1383a Parts
Margaret
for details concerning the running conditions, please look here .
Ran a 0.8%gel at 95V.
Please refer to the annotated picture.
Extraction of Biobricks and Transformation in DB3.1
Margaret
streaked plates on Amp100 plates
for details please look here .
Sequencing
Grace
Redid PCR reactions for GFP fusion, BB-pRL1383a, B0015, J04430, R0010
Gel OK this time (95V for 50 min; ladder resolved, loading dye didn't run funny)
Incorrect bands still for B0015, J04430, R0010; Krystle will redo the plasmid preps for these
Correct bands for GFP fusion and BB-pRL1383a. BB-pRL1383a band faint -- why?
Treated PCR products w/ ExoSAP
Determined DNA concentrations using nanodrop spectrometer (measured twice)

Media Making
Margaret, Krystle (thanks for the help!)
Made one sleeve of Amp100 plates.
Plasmid Prep of GFP fusion Brick, R0010, J3340
Krystle
did a large scale (75 ml) plasmid prep for the GFP fusion brick
Performed 3 mini preps each of the BioBrick parts
