Agenda
PCR Week!  (our 38 primers arrived last Friday.) What else do we need?
Template DNA: pSB1A3 ? to PCR out BioBrick Site from pSB1A3 (straight replacement of pRL1383a Multiple Cloning Site -> BioBrick Site)
GK: Actually, it's not pSB1A3 (RE site problems). The primers will work with any Biobrick plasmid, like pSB1A2 (no RE problems) or pSB2K3. Neither have the ccdB gene and are available on plates 1003/4A and 1014/1F, respectively.
Template DNA: Anabaena cells? to PCR out Nir promoter assemble from oligos
BioBrick Extracted Roundup
summarize what we extracted and update their status ( here , and relocate it to the public Wiki)
cryostocked
plasmid prepped
sequence verified
Revisit Project Description (due Tuesday 7/1)
Inventory Walk-through (4C Fridge organization, -20C Freezer shelf organization, -80C Freezer shelf organization)
2nd Round of Primer Ordering (review and finalize list)
