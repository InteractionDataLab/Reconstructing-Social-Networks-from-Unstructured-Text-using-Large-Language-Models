Present: Margaret, Krystle, Grace, Norman, SC, LG, GP Advice
Transformations: don't go over 10% of DNA added to competent cells, this dilutes them too much.
For the pRL1383a construct, use the omega interposon, not just the aadA gene. The former is a complete package already.
Action Items
Krystle and Grace:
e-mail headquarters to ask for the BioBrick parts you need. Make sure to tell them about all of your successes so they know you are credible.
May also be worth trying to PCR amplify the biobrick parts you need.
Verify your emergency pRL1383a with the primers for your insert.
Restriction Enzymes
Check a few different catalogues (Roche, Promega, etc.) to see if they have buffers which are compatible with multiple enzymes running simultaneously.
Separately cut the construct with enzymes. See which one makes the ladder. Let's try to figure out why this ladder is happening and how to avoid getting it.
Lichenase
Order the genomic DNA containing the lichenase gene.
For a back-up, we can ask Dr. Schara if she has any interesting enzymes we could use. The only problem is that by not using Lichenase, we lose a positive control and there will be no way to tie it into the literature.
