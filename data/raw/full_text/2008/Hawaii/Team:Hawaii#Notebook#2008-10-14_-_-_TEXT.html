Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of secretion device (cont.)
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digested DNA were loaded into each well.
Grace
Ran RE digests on gel
Extracted rgt1 and prpgt5 from gel
Ligated:
prpgt5 + BBpRL1383a-1
nir + rgt1 + BBpRL1383a-1
plac + rgt1 + BBpRL1383a-1
nrsg6 (from 10/11) + BBpRL1383a-1
J33207 + pRL1383a
Plasmid Prep
Krystle
Plasmid Prepped 2 cultures of BBpRL1383
Nanodrop concentration is 330 ng/ul
Gel verification for plasmid shows blank lanes
Drylab Work
Sequencing analysis
Grace
prpgt, nrsg, sgt, and pgt sequences all returned inserts of E. coli genomic DNA instead of desired construct
