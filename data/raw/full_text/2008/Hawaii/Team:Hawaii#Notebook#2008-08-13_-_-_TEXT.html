Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of Transformants
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 100 min. Five microliters of PCR reaction were loaded into each well.

Colony PCR of transformants and restreaked colonies from yesterday
Ran on 2.5% agarose gel at 95V for 100 min.
Restreaked:
slr1+GFPf colony 5
pilA+GFPf colony 4
GFPf likely J33207 due to mix up -- see below
Plasmid Prep
Margaret
OriV1-4 and aadA(BB) 4 **the only correct transformants from yesterday's ligation/transformation
Ligation
Margaret
I corrected my math from yesterday's ligation and re-did the ones that did not ligate correctly
Krystle
Ligated using quick ligation buffer and quick ligase:
gfpf+B0015(digested by MR)
gfpf+B0015(digested by GK)
gfp+B0015(digested by MR)
B0015(digested by MR) <-- as a control
Transformation
Margaret
omega ligation from yesterday
rep+B0030, P1+B0015, aadA(pRL1383a) +B0030 from today's ligation
Krystle
Transformed using DB3.1
Ligation products from today (see above)
Notes: Initial incubation on ice only 3 minutes, final incubation with SOC only 1 hour
Gel From Yesterday's Colony PCR
Margaret
Drylab Work
Sequencing
Grace
Checked sequencing results returned from CORE Hawaii
Confirmed:
B0015
B0030
B0034 (one bp off)
nir
slr
slr1 = slr2   huh?
Other:
nir+rbs
No rbs present; only nir
Huh? We ligated nir INTO rbs
I14032+rbs
No plac present; only rbs
BB-pRL1383a
E0040 (GFP) went in successfully, not J33207
WTF? Our plasmid preps were/are mislabeled
Redo ligation to get blue/white screen?
GFP+tt (reverse only)
Low quality read; GFP is not present (segment too small)
GFPf+tt (reverse only)
lacZ fragment present; no tt
Huh? We ligated the part INTO tt
GFPf+tt and J33207+tt samples switched?
J33207+tt
Part did not go in; tt only
