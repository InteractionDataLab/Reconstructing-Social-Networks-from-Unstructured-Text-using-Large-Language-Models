Wetlab work
Alkaline Lysis Mini-prep
Margaret
Plasmid prep of pSB1A2, pSB1A3, and pSB3K3: 3 1.5 mL preps of the first two, and 10 of the third because it has a lower copy number. Used the protocol from Dr. Callahan's lab ([ [1] ]).
I had to skip the phenol/chloroform step, so after adding Rnase A and incubating for 20 minutes, I spun down again, collected the supernatant and then precipitated with isopropanol.
The write-up for this prep can be found here under the 7/23 attempt.
Grace
nir, pilA, slr-1, slr-2, GFP fusion
Added 1 μl 10mg/ml RNAse to each plasmid prep after transferring supernatant; incubated at 55C for 90 min.
Glycerol Stock
Margaret
glycerol stock of pSB1A2, pSB1A3, and pSB3K3. These DB3.1 strains containing these plasmids can be found in the -80C with the other plasmids in E. coli.
Grace
nir, pilA, slr-1, slr-2, GFP fusion, BB-pRL1383a, BBa_E0026
pRL1383a insert Clean-up
Margaret
in preparation for constructing the biobrick form of pRL1383a, cleaned the PCR products: mob, rep, oriV, and the aadA region using the "Isopropanol Precipitation for PCR purification" protocol from openwetware.org
Cleaned the oriT construct using the Qiagen Minelute Gel Purification kit.
Made 80% glycerol stock solution
Grace
Organized plasmid preps
Grace
Determined DNA concentrations of all plasmid preps to date
Relabeled all tubes w/ plasmid (or BioBrick part), DNA concentration, date of prep, and initials of person who prepped
Posted more detailed plasmid prep information on private website
BioBrick assembly/subcloning
Grace
Extracted GFP, B0024, B0034 from gel using MiniElute Spin Kit from Qiagen
Checked concentration of parts using nanodrop
DNA concentration of parts extracted from agarose gel

GFP + B0024 (tt)
GFP fusion + B0024 (tt)
Incubated ligation reaction for 2 hours at room temperature
Transformed DH5α with ligated parts
Used 5 μl ligation reaction for each transformation
