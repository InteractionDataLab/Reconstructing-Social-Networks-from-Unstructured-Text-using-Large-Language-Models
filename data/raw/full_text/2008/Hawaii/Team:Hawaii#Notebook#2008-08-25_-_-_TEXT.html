Wetlab work
Ligation & Transformation
Margaret
ligation of rep+pSB1A3 and P1+pSB1A3, transformation into DH5alpha cells
Colony PCR
Margaret
verified the colonies from the (pLac+B0030) ligation and transformation. no transformants for the B0034 ligation
Verification of transformants (cont.)
EtBr stained 3% agarose gel ran at 60V for 3 hours. Two microliters of PCR reaction were loaded into each well.
Grace
PCR'd nir, nir+rbs, GFP, GFP+rbs
Ran on 3% agarose gel
Restriction digest
Grace
RE digested overnight:
BB-pRL1383a and J33207 with XbaI and PstI
C0012 with EcoRI and PstI (to isolate vector)
nir with EcoRI and SpeI
Ligation
Krystle
Ligated overnight:
plac + B0034 (both synthesized)
plac + B0030 (both synthesized)
