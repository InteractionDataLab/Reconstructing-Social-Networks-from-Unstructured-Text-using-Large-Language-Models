Our team aims to create the framework and tools for expanding the scope of BioBrick synthetic biology to organisms other than E. coli.  Creation of a mobilizable broad-host-range plasmid enables the transfer of modularized and abstracted genetic components to act in wide range of organisms that share a similar pool of intermediate metabolites.  A broad-host-range mobilizable vector would serve as a channel to "open source" the rich diversity of genetic information between organisms in a laboratory setting.  We envision a wide diversity of future broad-host-range BioBrick parts, created and transported, with this or similar BioBrick vectors; each designated to be compatible with specific organism(s). These modules can also be combinatorially transformed or combined into organisms as larger devices to produce desired products. more...
