The driving force of this inaugural Hawaii team have been the three motivated, dedicated and talented undergraduates:  Margaret Ruzicka (PEB 2008), Krystle Salazar (BE 2009) and Grace Kwan (Microbiology 2009), and the trail-blazing MBBE graduate student, Norman Wang.  The group has been expertly advised by the three advisors Gernot Presting (MBBE), Sean Callahan (UH-Microbiology), and Loren Gautz (MBBE).

Facts
The Hawaii team really likes gummi bears and cookies.  Our gummy bear diet can be (and often has been) substituted with Swedish Fish .
At the highest consumption rate, we devoured two pounds of gummy bears during a three hour meeting.
When combined, Grace's and Krystle's initials are a palindrome (KSGSK).  Norman claims they speak and dress alike to confuse faculty and advisors.
