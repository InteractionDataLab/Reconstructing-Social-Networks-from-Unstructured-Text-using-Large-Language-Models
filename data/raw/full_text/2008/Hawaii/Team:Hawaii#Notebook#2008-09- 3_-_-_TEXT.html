Wetlab work
Re-replacement of BB-pRL1383a MCS
Grace
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digest reaction were loaded into each well.
Ran last night's RE digest on a gel
BB-pRL1383a band did not show up. Nanodrop said DNA conc. ~329 ng/μl. Added 22μl for rxn (7000+ ng DNA). DNA conc. really wrong.
Cut RE digested J33207 band from gel.
Overnight RE digest of BB-pRL1383a (my prep from 8/29) with HindIII and BamHI
