Wetlab work
Plasmid prep of Biobricks
Krystle
Plasmid prep for B0015, E0026, R0010, J33207, B0030
Construction of pnir, slr2016, pilA with vector
Grace
Extracted DNA from gel using Qiagen MiniElute Gel Extraction Kit
Ligated pnir, slr2016, pilA with BBa_C0012 harboring vector
Ligated C0012 with vector as positive control
Ligated annealed products with vector
Ran ligations on gel
Annealed products + vector = smear
Rest of gel blank = not enough DNA
Made stock solutions
Grace
