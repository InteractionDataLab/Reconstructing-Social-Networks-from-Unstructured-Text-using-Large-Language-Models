Annotation of vector with Vector NTI (Register and we can save our data)
Some advice
Working with the Registry:
the wells (spots) have parts, there is a picture of it run on a gel, and there is a verification with antibiotic plates
When we test parts out, use color coding on plates for different antibiotics
Should we use 96 well plates for high throughput screening of parts?
Decide input and output of project
Make plasmid biobrick compatible (we should make every part a biobrick, this way we can mix and match parts on a plasmid as needed)**don’t get left with one huge part that does not function the way we want it to, then start from zero.
Presentations:
Norman: the big idea behind using BioBricks (MIT teaching the teach notes). Biobrick assembly, parts category (RBS, Regulatory, DNA, RNA, Protein Coding, Terminators, {skipped conjugation}) Meeting Slides (PDF)
Margaret: devices
Krystle: chassis & plasmids
Action
Krystle
read up on RSF1010 make proposal for plasmid project (post ASAP)
Norman
Buy a KVM
Shopping
Margaret
finish the annotation and figure out the functions of the components
Begin proposal on the plasmid, what do we want to keep, we can delete stuff we don’t need using PCR, learn how to design primers that can delete and make biobricks
Everybody
Prepare proposal for part B (the idea you are championing)
Biobricks come on plasmids, so we need to get transformation down
Finalize shopping list, order by June 10th (can’t order between 6/15-6/30)
