CO2 Experiment
Hypothesis
SynechocystisPCC6803 is a cyanobacteria and therefore reduces CO2 to carbohydrates. We hypothesize that if the incubator is equipped with CO2gas flow, then colonies that grow will be more robust.
Methods
Four plates were streaked for colonies, two were placed in an incubator equipped with CO2 flow while two were placed in an incubator lacking CO2 flow.
Results
The two plates from the incubator equipped with CO2 were observed today. There were more colonies and furthermore, the colonies were twice as big.
Conclusions
With our no-CO2 incubator, it is possible to get colonies, but this process would be optimized by using the CO2 incubator
Things We Did Today
Prepared LB Broth
Margaret, Krystle, Norman
Created 2 500ml bottles of LB broth using Difco LB Broth, Miller
Discussion
If our action is not recorded, we are doomed to either repeat the error, or fail to replicate the success.
History is the only laboratory we have in which to test the consequences of thought. - Étienne Gilson
