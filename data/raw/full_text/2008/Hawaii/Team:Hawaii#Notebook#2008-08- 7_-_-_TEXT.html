Things we did today
Wetlab work
Plasmid prep
Krystle
Finished plasmid prep of BB-pRL1383a, nir, GFPf from yesterday
Cyanobacteria seed stocks
Krystle
Reinoculated liquid and solid media seed stocks
Verification of transformants
EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel ran at 95V for 75 min. Ten microliters of the PCR reaction were loaded into each well.
Grace
Construct
Colony forming units
nir + B0030 (rbs)
2 + 1 cluster of colonies
plac (I14032) + B0030 (rbs)
37
GFP (E0040) + B0015 (tt)
8
GFPf + B0015 (tt)
4
lac device (J33207) + B0015 (tt)
56
Colony PCR of transformants
Ran on EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel at 95V for 75 min.
Looks like nir+rbs and I14032+rbs worked. YAY :o). Will prep for sequencing tomorrow.
GFP, GFPf, J33207 don't look like they went in. Will sequence to confirm anyway.
Plasmid Prep
Margaret
Plasmid Prep of pSMC121.
Re-did yesterday's plasmid prep of pSMC121 because I don't believe the band was big enough. I e-mailed Dr. Callahan to get the exact size, but I know, because it contains the omega interposon, that it is at least 2kb.
Extraction from Gel
Margaret
extracted 3 bands of 50ul reaction for rep and oriV first by cutting out using long wave UV for visualization.
Purification from gel with Qiagen Minelute gel purification kit.
PCR
Large scale PCR for amplification of P1 lytic and aadA region.
Margaret
Large-scale PCR amplification of  aadA (it was lost in a gel cutting mishap) and p1 lytic.
Discussion
Quote of the Day
Gernot: "So would you eat the E. coli to save them if we lose the -80C in like a war?"
Loren: "Well, I'll eat them, but you'll be collecting them."
