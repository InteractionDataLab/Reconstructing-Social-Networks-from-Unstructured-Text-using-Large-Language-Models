Things we did today
Wetlab work
Verification of transformants
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1.5 hours. Five microliters of PCR reaction were loaded into each lane.

Colony PCR of transformants
Ran PCR reaction on 2% agarose gel
Can't tell 15bp difference between GFP and rbs+GFP
Restreaked single colony and inoculated for plasmid prep to confirm
nir+rbs colonies #11-19 appear promising (larger than nir)
Restreaked colony #19 and inoculated for plasmid prep to confirm
Plasmid prep of J33207
