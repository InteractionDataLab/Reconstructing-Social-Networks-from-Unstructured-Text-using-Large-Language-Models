Wetlab work
Tested competency of new batch of competent cells
Grace
Same protocol as 6/3/08 competency test
Plated 20 μl untransformed competent cells on LB+amp100 as negative control
Biobricks extraction
Grace
Extracted BBa_B0024, BBa_B0025, and BBa_E0240 from filter paper using same protocol 6/9/08

Grace
Made stock solutions
0.5M EDTA
1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
5M KOAc (3M potassium, 5M acetate, pH 4.8)
Made alkaline lysis solutions

Plasmid has not dried yet (ethanol still evaporating) so it will dry in the hood overnight. Norman will resuspend the pellet in 30 μl TE buffer tomorrow morning.
