Things we did today
Wetlab work
Insertion of lac-GFP device into BB-pRL1383a
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 60V for 90 minutes. Thirty microliters of the RE digest reaction were loaded into each well.
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 60V for 90 minutes. Ten microliters of PCR product were loaded.
Grace
Ran RE digests on gel
Bands were all incorrect size
Reinoculated TB+sp100 for plasmid prep tomorrow
PCR of J04430 from filter paper to verify part; used H/B primers
Team:Hawaii/Antibiotic test for BB-pRL1383a
Grace
Made LB+spvariable plates with 50 μl 20X X-gal
Transformed 100 μl DH5α with 2 μl BB-pRL1383a (4 ng)
Plated 50 μl cells + SOB on each LB+sp plate; plated 20 μl untransformed cells + SOB on each control plate
Incubated at 37C for 2 days
Construction of GFP secretion device
Krystle
Gel purified overnight restriction digested nir+rbs
Loaded all of restriction digest into a 2% gel, which appeared blank after running for 1.5 hours
Re-PCR nir+rbs and slr+gfpf from plasmid prep
Restriction digest
nir+rbs with EcoRI and SpeI
slr+gfpf with XbaI and PstI
