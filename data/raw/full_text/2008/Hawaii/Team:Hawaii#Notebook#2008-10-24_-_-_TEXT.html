Observations collected 19 hours after initial plating.
Restreak plate of colonies 1, 2 and 3 of the lac+rbs_slr+gfpf construct.
Verification of GFP secretion device
Krystle
Viewed restreaks of lac+rbs+slr+gfgf and nir+rbs+slr+gfpf under blue flourescent light.
lac+rbs+slr+gfpf colony 1 glows!
Dry Lab Work
Analyzed sequencing results
Krystle
Sequencing for lac+rbs+slr+gfpf only had a good reverse read, must be resequenced
All sequenced nir+rbs+slr+gfpf colonies contain the incorrect insert
