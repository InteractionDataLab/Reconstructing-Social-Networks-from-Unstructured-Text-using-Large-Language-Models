Things we did today
Wetlab work
Reconstruction of BB-pRL1383a
EtBr stained 1% agarose gel ran at 72V for 1.5 hours. Thirty-five microliters of RE digested BB-pRL1383a and fifty microliters of RE digested J33207 were loaded.

PCR amplification of J33207
ExoSAP'd PCR product
RE digested of J33207 and BB-pRL1383a (w/ GFP) with EcoRI and PstI
Ran digests on a 1% agarose gel at 72V for 1.5 hours.
Ladder did not run well. Bands not resolving well.
Redid PCR and RE digests with XbaI and PstI
Made 20X X-gal stock solution (20 mg/ml)

Restriction Digest
Margaret
Digested J33207 (contains lacZ for blue/white screening), oriT--> these will be ligated so i can test the origin of transfer in a conjugation experiment.
Digested I14032 and the aadA(BB) which was inserted into B0030 so I can ligate these two together.
Streak to verify antibiotic resistance
Margaret
On an LB plate containing Sm&Sp, the omega ligation (from 8-12). This will be a verification that the omega ligation worked. As a positive control I streaked pSMC121 which contains the omega interposon, and as a negative control I streaked pSB1A2 (in case the plates have lost their effectiveness).

DH5α does not carry lacIq; therefore, IPTG is not neccessary to induce the lac promoter.
IPTG is necessary for induction in DB3.1 cells.
