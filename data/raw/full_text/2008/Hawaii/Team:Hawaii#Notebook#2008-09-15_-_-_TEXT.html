Things we did today
Wetlab work
PCR from 9/13
Margaret
Gel of saturday's PCR.
Rep, oriV- correct size, so restriction digest with X,P of PCR product
omega- correct size, but still has a ladder, so re-digest of plasmid prep with  S, X
oriT did not show up, but I found a re-digest from 7/24 that I will use for further cloning
positive control did not work, not sure if negative control worked or if I did something wrong.
