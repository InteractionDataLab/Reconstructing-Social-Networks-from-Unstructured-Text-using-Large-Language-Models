Things we did today
Wetlab work
PCR
Grace
25 μl PCR reactions for GFP site directed mutagenesis and extraction of Biobrick pertinent sites from BBa_B0034
Made stocks
Grace
Made two 500mL batches of SOB
Made 20 LB + amp100 plates
Transformed DH5α with ligations of a Biobrick vector with pnir, slr2016-1, slr2016-2, pilA, or C0012
Grace
Transformed using 5 μl of 1:1 and 1:10 ligation dilutions
Transformed using 1 μl vector only (negative control)
Incubated on ice 10 min as opposed to the recommended 30 min. by iGEM
RE digested PCR products and plasmids
Grace
XbaI and PstI: GFP fusion brick and BBa_C0012
Added XbaI and PstI separately
Ran 25 μl of GFP and 20 μl of BBa_C0012 restriction digest reactions in gel
HindIII and BamHI: Biobrick segment and pRL1383a
Ran 25 μl of Biobrick segment (half of total rxn) and 20 μl of pRL1383a restriction digest reactions in gel
pRL1383a was not visbile under long wave UV. Need to rerun gel tomorrow with much more plasmid
Transformed DB3.1
Margaret
Transformed: pSB3K3, pSB1A2, pSB1AK3, (+)pUC18, (-)nothing. The positive and negative control verify that the DB3.1 competent cells  made on 7/11/08 can take up DNA. The results of this test can be seen here .
