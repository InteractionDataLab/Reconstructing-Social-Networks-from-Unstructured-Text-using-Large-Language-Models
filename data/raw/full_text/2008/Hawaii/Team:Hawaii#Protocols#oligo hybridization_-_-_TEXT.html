Hybridization of Parts
Protocol
Mix:
3 μl 100 µM sense oligo
3 μl 100 µM anti-sense oligo
3 μl 10 x PNK (polynucleotide kinase) buffer
2 μl 10mM ATP
2 μl T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK)
17 μl distilled water
Total volume = 30 μl
Incubate at 37C for 1.5 hours.
Add 4 μl 0.5 M NaCl.
Heated mixture in PCR machine to 97C for 2 min. Cooled mixture at each degree between 80 and 96 for 2 min (Tm range of oligos). Cooled mixture at each degree between 25 and 79 for 1 min.
