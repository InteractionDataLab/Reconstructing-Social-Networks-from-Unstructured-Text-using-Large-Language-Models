Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of secretion device (cont.)
Grace
File:100908REdigest.jpg
EtBr stained 4% agarose gel ran at 60V for 3.5 hours. Twenty microliters of RE digested product were loaded into each well.
Ran RE digests on gel
Extracted bands from gel
Ligated:
J33207 and pRL1383a
nir and rbs+GFPf+tt #1 and pSB1A3
plac and rbs+GFPf+tt #1 and pSB1A3
nir+rbs and slr1+GFPf and pSB1A3
nir+rbs and pilA+GFPf+tt and pSB1A3
Used 5 μl ligation reaction to transform DH5α
Sequencing
Grace
Prepared and sent samples in for sequencing:
pilA+GFPf+tt #21 (KS)
nir+rbs+slr1+GFPf #15 (10/2 transformation)
slr1+GFPf+tt (10/2 transformation)
nir+rbs+slr1+GFPf #6 (10/8 transformation)
plac+rbs+pilA+GFPf+tt #5, 7, 11 (10/8 transformation)
Triparental conjugtion
Grace
BBpRL #1, 18 cultures did not grow
PCR of colonies (on Xgal plate) showed no insert present (?!?)
PCR of colonies from non-Xgal plate) showed no insert present (?!?)
Faint band for colonies #1, 13 at 400bp ???
Restreaked original colonies #1, 3, 13, 18 on freshly made LB+sp100+sm100
Original colonies scraped w/ loop. Hopefully there's something there.
Made 5%LB+BG-11 and BG-11+sp2.5+sm2.5 plates
Grace and Krystle
Construction of plasmid

File:Rep aadA purification 10 9.jpg
plac/rbs/rep5 (E,S), plac/rbs/rep7 (E,S), plac/rbs/aada (ap32 E,S), plac/rbs/aada ap2 cut with X,P.
Gel purification of re-digest
plac/rbs/aada (ap32 was cut with E,S), ap2 did not cut correctly
plac/rbs/rep (7 was cut with E,S), rep5 did not cut correctly
Ligation, transformation (in DH5 alpha):
oriT + plac/rbs/aada + pSB1A3 (dephosphorylated)
oriV + plac/rbs/rep + pSB1A3 (dephosphorylated)
pSB1A3 (dephosphorylated) + self
(+) control for transformation- pUC18
(-) control for transformation- no plasmid
OriV back-ups
margaret
File:Oriv verification 10 9.jpg
Verification of oriV transformation.
two colonies were of correct size from yesterday's transformation, so i did a plasmid prep of them and I will store them in -20 C in TE
