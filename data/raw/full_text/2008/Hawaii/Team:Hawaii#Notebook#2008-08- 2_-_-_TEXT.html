Things we did today
Wetlab work
PCR
Grace
Colony PCR of nir-1, nir-2, GFPf-1, GFPf-2
Annealed at 62C; extended for 1 min.
Used all new PCR water, primer solution, and Green Taq
Cut out bands for nir-1, GFP-1 (correct size)
PCR of PCR components to test for contamination
New primer solution + new PCR water + old Taq = no bands
Old primer solution + new PCR water + new Taq = band at 300bp = primer solution was contaminated
New primer solution + old PCR water + new Taq = bands at 270bp and 350bp = PCR water was contaminated
EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2 hours. Five microliters of each PCR reaction was loaded into each well.
Gel after excision of nir-1 and GFPf-1 bands.
EtBr stained 4% agarose gel ran at 95V for 90 min. Ten microliters of each PCR reaction was loaded into each well.
Cryostocked
Grace
nir-1, GFPf-1
Threw out old (incorrect) cryostocks of nir and GFPf
