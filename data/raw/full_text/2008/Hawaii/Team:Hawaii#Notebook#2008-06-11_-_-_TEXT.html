Made 165mL BG-11 for BG-11 washes

Make more LB+Amp plates
Krystle
Thaw Test
Norman
take final picture of thawing post thawing (~1wk).  Writeup discussion about the experiment . We have OK cryopreserved cells although it does not grow back very fast.  For more thorough test we need to measure OD, as well as optimal conditions... (CO2 incubator!!!)  Right now at least we know we have viable frozen cells.
Drylab Work
Standardized Notebook entries on the Wiki
Krystle
Fix Internal Wiki
Norman
fixed permission problems with wiki on internal prestinglab server. If you have trouble accessing it let me know.

Quote of the Day
I'll just ask Grace later. She speaks Krystle-language, meaning we save a lot of time because she already understands that I think weird and will adjust her explanation accordingly - Krystle to Norman about designing primers
