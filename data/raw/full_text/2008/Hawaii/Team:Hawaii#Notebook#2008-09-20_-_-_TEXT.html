Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of secretion device (cont.)
Grace
EtBr stained 4% agarose gels ran at 60V for 2.5 hours. Twenty five microliters of RE digest were loaded into each well.
Ran RE digests on 4% agarose gel
Extracted bands from gel
Ligated overnight:
nir+rbs & pilA & pSB1A3
nir+rbs & slr1+GFPf & pSB1A3
slr1+GFPf & tt & pSB1A3
rbs & slr1+GFPf & pSB1A3
plac & rbs+GFP & pSB1A3
rbs+GFP & tt & pSB1A3
pSB1A3 to self (control)
Drylab Work
Sequencing
Grace & Krystle
Figured out Krystle's sequencing results
GFPf+tt 17F+8R = ccdB base vector
GFPf+tt 8F+21R = rbs (B0030+GFPf)
GFPF+tt 21F+17R = GFPf+B1006
Need to resequence #21, 17 because no way to tell which is correct (F/R)
