Wetlab work
Restriction Digest
Grace
Sequential digest of B0015 with XbaI and EcoRI
Checked transformants from yesterday's ligations

PCR
Grace & Krystle
Colony PCR. EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel. Two microliters of the PCR reactions were loaded into each well.
PCR extractionof Biobricks. EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2 hours. Five microliters of each reaction were loaded into each well.
Colony PCR'd all transformants from yesterday's ligations and slr1, slr2, nir, pilA, GFPf
Annealed at 58C, elongated for 90 sec.
PCR of E0240 and I14032 from filter paper
Annealed at 58C, elongated for 90 sec.
Ran on 2.5% gel
Contaminant at 250bp
pRL1383a = 5 bands (~1.2kb, ~0.9kb, ~0.35kb, ~0.3kb, ~0.25kb); desired band = 958bp
nir+rbs = 2 bands (~0.275kb, ~0.25kb); desired band = 353bp
nir was not inserted
E/X sites not compatible; ligase ligated blunt ends created by RE digest leftovers?
GFPf+tt = 2 bands (~0.32kb, ~0.25kb); desired band = 1081bp
GFPf not inserted
Extracted E0240, slr1, slr2, GFP, pilA, I14032 from gel (correct sizes)
GFPf = ~1150bp (too big, what's going on? we're consistently getting GFPf this big)
nir = ~1100bp (too big)
Since sequencing returned correct sequences for GFPf and nir, regrow E. coli from colony used for sequencing and see if desired/expected results can be obtained or if results are the same

Quote of the Day
Logically, it makes sense, but we're not always very logical people so it's still a weird numbering system - KS, GK in reference to the BioBrick part numbers
