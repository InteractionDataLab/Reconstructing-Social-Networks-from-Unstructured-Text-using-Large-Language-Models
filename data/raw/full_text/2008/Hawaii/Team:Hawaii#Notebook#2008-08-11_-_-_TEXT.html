Things we did today
Wetlab work
Checked plasmid prep from weekend
Grace
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Five microliters of plasmid were loaded into each well.
Ran on 2.0% agarose gel to verify plasmids
DNA didn't run. Agarose concentration too high. Redid on 0.8% gel.
Genomic DNA up top?
Clean prep (no RNA)!
Only E0240 verified. All other bands wrong size (circular/supercoiled?). Need RE digest to verify.
Checked DNA concentrations via nanodrop spectrometer

Reinoculated for cryostocking

I14032 from 2005 and 2008 distributions
Construction of GFP device
Grace
Extracted nir+rbs, plac+rbs, GFP, GFPf from gel ran yesterday
B0015 could not be extracted because fragment was not visible under short wave UV
Digestion was done for 3A assembly rather than rear ligation (oops). Redid RE digest.

EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 72V for 1.5 hours. Thirty microliters of the RE digest reactions were loaded into each well.
Restriction digested in 30 μl reactions, incubated at 37C for 2 hours:
B0015 with XbaI then EcoRI
GFP and GFPf with EcoRI and SpeI
slr1, slr2, pilA with SpeI and PstI
Ran new RE digests EtBr stained 2% agarose gel at 72V for 1.5 hours
Extracted parts from gel and determined DNA concentrations

Ligated for 1 hour using Quick T4 DNA Ligase and Quick Ligase buffer:
8 μl GFP + 0.5 μl B0015
4 μl GFPf + 4 μl B0015
2 μl GFPf + 1.5 μl slr1
2 μl GFPf + 3.5 μl pilA
Transformed 7 μl ligation reaction into DB3.1 cells
RE digest overnight of 22 μl pSB1A2 with EcoRI and PstI for 3A assembly
Testing restriction enzymes in the lab's -20C freezer
Grace
Digested pRL1383a with BamHI (should result in a single linear fragment)
Digested pRL1383a with HindIII (should result in a single linear fragment)
Digested plasmid preps (E0240, I14032, I51020, nir+rbs, plac+rbs) with NotI (should result in two fragments -- vector and insert)
Ligation of pRL1383a Parts
Restriction digest after 2 hours.
Ligation reaction after 2 hours.
Margaret
restriction digest of rep, oriV, aada(BB), aada(pRL1383a), P1 lytic region, pSB1A3, B0030, B0015
Ligation: rep+B0030, oriV+pSB1A3, aadA(BB)+B0030, aadA(pRL1383a)+B0030, P1 lytic + B0015, pSB1A3 to itself (-) control
Transformation into DH5-a (batch 3)
Started Culture for plasmid prep & cryostocks
to be completed 8/12
B0015, pSB3K3, oriT(cryostock & plasmid prep), B0030, I14032, E0040, J33207
Discussion
FYI:
According to the Endy lab, ligation reactions should have <100ng DNA per reaction for maximum efficiency
~10ng vector should be used in ligation reactions (6:1 ratio of insert to vector)
