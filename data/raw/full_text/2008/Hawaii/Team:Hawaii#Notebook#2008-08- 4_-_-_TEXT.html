Rep, oriV, verification of I14032, oriT(just to make sure)
Materials & Methods
Reaction Conditions: 3.5ul water, 0.5ul template, 1.0ul f&r primer, 5ul econotaq
Running conditions (I14032, oriT): 94°C hold, 94°C 2', (95°C 30", 62°C 30",  72°C 30") x 30cycles, 72°C 10', 4°C hold
Running conditions (oriV + controls): 94°C hold, 94°C 2', (95°C 30", 51.3°C 30",  72°C 30") x 30cycles, 72°C 10', 4°C hold
Running conditions (rep + controls): 94°C hold, 94°C 2', (95°C 30", 53.9°C 30",  72°C 3'20") x 20 cycles, (95°C 30", 53.9°C 30",  72°C 3'30") x 10 cycles72°C 10', 4°C hold
Results
Lane 2: PCR verification of I14032: There are two bands. The top  band does not correspond to Plac, while the bottom band is just above  0.4kb, about 50bp more than would be expected. Lane 3: PCR verification of OriT: The band is just above 0.4kb, and the verification part is 0.415 kb. Lane 4: Amplification of oriV from pRL1383a:The band is at 4.5kb, as  expected. Lane 5&8: pSB1A7 was used as a (+) control: While the same size was amplified in both positive control reactions, I would expect a band at 1265bp, but the amplicon is just below 0.9kb. Lane 6&9: VF2 and VR were used to amplify water. As expected, nothing was amplified. Lane 7:The rep region was amplified correctly. I expected a band at 3.352kb and the band  occurred in this region.
Discussion
I did some trouble shooting on this PCR with advice from: [ [1] ].
In most cases, I just got as close to the recommended annealing temperature and extension time in order to decrease the amount of unspecific products.
I only ran 30 cycles as opposed to 35 in the past. I think this has made the efficiency of my taq more consistent, especially with the longer products.
I also added an additional 10 seconds to last 20 cycles of the rep region, [ [2] ], recommends this extra time because the taq supposedly loses efficiency and thus there will be multiple products of suspicious size. This seems to have worked for the rep region, which contains only one product.
Transformation
Margaret
pSMC121 (we were running out of template)
re-streaked transformants on 8-5. There was a lawn of transformants.
Re-streak Library
Margaret
pSB1A7, L51020, psb3k3, psb1a3, oriT, psb1a2, db3.1 strain, i14032
Construction of p+r, g+t
EtBr stained 3% agarose gel ran at 60V for 100 min. Twenty microliters of the restriction digests were loaded into each well.

RE digest
nir, GFP, GFPf, I14032 digested with EcoRI and SpeI
E0240 digested with EcoRI and PstI
slr1, slr2, pilA digested with PstI and XbaI
Ran RE digests on gel
Incomplete digestion of nir, slr1, slr2, pilA
Krystle
Gel purified RE digests of nir1, GFPf1, GFP, E0240, I14032, slr1, slr2, pilA
Ligated at 37C overnight:
nir + B0030
I14032 + B0030
GFP + B0015
GFPf + B0015
Supposed to ligate at 25C
PCR
EtBr stained 2.5% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Ten microliters of the PCR reactions were loaded into each well.
Grace
Redid Saturday's PCR of BB-pRl1383a and pRL1383a alongside test of PCR contamination
Ran on 2.5% gel for 1 hour at 95V
Gel doesn't match that from Saturday
Redid PCR again to verify Saturday/today's PCR
