Things we did today
Wetlab work
Checked transformants from yesterday
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Ten microliters of each colony PCR reaction were loaded into each well. Positive control was a nir colony PCR (previously confirmed) and negative control was water.

E0040 (GFP) + B0015 (tt)

Colony PCR'd transformants
30 cycles, anneal at 62C, extend for 1 min.
Ran on EtBr stained 2.0% agarose gel at 95V for 1 hour
None of the transformations were successful :o(
Determined DNA concentrations of purified RE'd PCR products from 8/4

DNA sample
Concentration
nir

slr1
31.3 ng/μl
slr2
11.8 ng/μl
pilA
13.0 ng/μl
GFP
12.0 ng/μl
GFPf
12.2 ng/μl
E0240
8.6 ng/μl
I14032
16.8 ng/μl
Prepared PCR'd nir and J33207 (from yesterday) for transformation/ligation
Grace
Ran PCR products on EtBr stained 2.0% agarose gel  at 60V for 100 min.
nir band at 330bp confirmed
J33207 = 4 bands (1.5kb, 2.5kb, 3.2kb, 10kb), none of which are correct
partsregistry says J33207 DNA is inconsistent
Extracted nir and 1.5kb J33207 band from gel
RE digested in 50 μl rxns with EcoRI and SpeI in NEBuffer 2
Larger rxn volume may improve digest efficiency
Incubated at 37C for 2.5 hours
RE digested 10 μl J33207 plasmid prep with EcoRI and SpeI in NEBuffer 2
To confirm plasmid prep; if good, will use for ligation rxn
Incubated at 37C for 2 hours
Ran RE digests on EtBr stained 2.0% agarose gel at 72V for 90 min.
No visible bands for nir and J33207 RE digest
We lost a LOT of DNA in the gel purification.
Band for J33207 plasmid prep RE digest should be ~650bp
Band at ~850bp = VF2-VR = RE didn't cut???
Extracted J33207 band (~850) from gel
Ligated 4.5 μl J33207 with 1.5 μl B0015 (tt)
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 60V for 100 min. Seven microliters of the PCR reactions were loaded into each lane.
nir (300bp) and (incorrect) J33207 (1.5kb) bands excised from an EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 60V for 100 min.
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 72V for 100 min. Fifty microliters of the restriction digests were loaded into each well.
J33207 plasmid prep band at ~850bp excised from an EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 72V for 100 min.
Krystle
Ligated using quick ligase buffer:
3 μl gfpf with 1 μl B0015 (tt)
3 μl gfp with 1 μl B0015 (tt)
3 μl nir with 1 μl B0030 (rbs)
3 μl I14032 with 1 μl B0030 (rbs)
Used 5 μl ligation reaction to transform 50 μl DB3.1 cells with the the 5 ligations mentioned above
Made LB+amp100 plates
Grace and Margaret
Plasmid Prep
Margaret
pSMC121 was plasmid prepped today
Krystle
Started 200 ml preps of GFPf, nir, and pRL1383aM
PCR
Margaret
PCR amplification of large quantities of rep, aada, and oriV.
made large quantities of aadA, rep, and oriV. Please refer to The experiment write-up for more details.
Drylab work
Sequencing
Grace
Reply from CORE Hawaii
They will resequence slr1, slr2, BB-pRL1383a for free due to potential mix up of samples and poor quality reads
For samples that were overloaded when 20ng/100bp sequencing guideline used, try 5 ng/100bp instead.

We're low on small nitrile gloves and Qiagen spin columns. Need to order more. NW
Be careful when pouring agar plates. Bubbles suck!
