Things we did today
Wetlab work
Biobrick Extraction
Margaret
Extracted Biobricks BBa_E0240, BBa_I4032, BBa_pSB3K3
Transformed into E. coli
7/08/08: checked and there are no transformants (I made a mistake about the death protein...), decided to drop this experiment until DB3.1 cells come in.
Oligonucleotide experiment
Grace
Ligated annealed products using 10-2 dilution of products
Reran on EtBr stained 4% agarose gel (result: light bands for annealed products, correct size; no bands for ligated product)
Ran annealed products (10-1 dilution) on SYBR Safe stained 2% agarose gel
Restriction digested ligation from 7/3/08 using XbaI and PstI in NEBuffer 3
Reran on EtBR stained 4% agarose gel
Plasmid prep
Krystle
Grew up E. coli from cryostock and performed an alkaline lysis plasmid prep for C0012
PCR of pRL1383a parts
Rep and Mob regions can be amplified by red/green taq.
Margaret
Amplification of rep and mob regions. Neither of these parts came out very well, so trying them with red and green taq.
