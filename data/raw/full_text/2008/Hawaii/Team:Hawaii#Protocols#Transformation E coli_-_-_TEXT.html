Team:Hawaii/Protocols/Transformation E coli
From 2008.igem.org
Protocol
Thawed cells on ice.
Transformed 50 μl cells w/ 1 μl DNA
Incubated on ice 30 min.
Heat shocked 60 sec. in 42C water bath
Added 250 μl SOC
Incubated @ 37C for 1 hour with shaking (150 rpm)
Plated 20-250 μl onto LB+antibiotic plates
Plate more if needed.
Notes
Adjust DNA amount as necessary. Transformation is saturated at >10ng DNA. DNA should not exceed 10% of cell volume (Re: SC).
Incubating 10 min. on ice after adding DNA and returning cells to ice for 2 min. after heat shock seems to improve transformation efficiency. -GK
