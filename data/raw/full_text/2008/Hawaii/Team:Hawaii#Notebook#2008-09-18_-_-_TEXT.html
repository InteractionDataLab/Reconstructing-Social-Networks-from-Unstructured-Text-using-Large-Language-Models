Things we did today
Wetlab work
Plasmid prep
Grace
Inoculated TB+sp100 with BB-pRL1383a for plasmid prep
PCR to verify plasmid preps
Grace
PCR of 3A:nrsg and 3A:nrpg13-8 plasmids
Construction of Secretion Device
Krystle
3A ligation of cut pSB1A3 with the following inserts:
nir + gfpf + tt #8
nir + gfpf + tt #17
nir + gfpf + tt #21
slr + gfpf + tt #8
slr + gfpf + tt #17
slr + gfpf + tt #21
Restreaked BB-pRL1383a plate
Grace
Transformation
Margaret
transformed ligation products in DH5-alpha
Drylab Work
Sequencing Analysis
Grace
Correct:
C0012V (sequence to see what it was): EcoRI/XbaI/SpeI/PstI sites present. Insert aligns to sequence for lacI (C0012 insert, vector was uncut)
C0012V-SAP'd (sequence to see what it was): EcoRI/XbaI/SpeI/PstI sites present. Insert aligns to sequence for lacI (C0012 insert, vector was uncut)
slr1+GFPf
Incorrect:
3A:nrp: EcoRI/PstI sites present. 82bp insert aligns to sequence for E. coli flagellar biosynthesis RNA polymerase sigma factor
3A:nrpg12-2: EcoRI/PstI sites present. 759bp insert aligns to sequence for E. coli fumarate reductase (anaerobic) catalytic and NAD/flavoprotein subunit
3A:nrpg12-6: EcoRI/PstI sites present. 899bp insert aligns to sequence for E. coli protein C5 component of RNAse P
3A:nrs2: EcoRI/PstI sites present. 85bp insert aligns to sequence for E. coli diaminopimelate decarboxylase, PLP-binding
3A:nrs3: SpeI/PstI sites present. Insert aligns to pilA sequence and pSB1A3 transcriptional termination stem loop
3A:nrsg10: SpeI/PstI sites present. Insert aligns to pilA + GFPf
pilA+GFPf12: GFPf only
plac+rbs1 (sequence to see what it was): EcoRI/XbaI/SpeI/PstI sites present. rbs (B0034) only
plac+rbs2 (sequence to see what it was): EcoRI/XbaI/SpeI sites present. Insert showed 97% similarity to RP4 origin of replication
plac+rbs12 (sequence to see what it was): EcoRI/XbaI/SpeI/PstI sites present. Insert is GFP only.
Resequence:
plac+rbs (no read -- only 5bp sequenced ?!?)
pilA+GFPf13 (no read -- only 5bp sequenced ?!?)

Please throw away old plates in 4C fridge. Some have fungi growing on them already.
