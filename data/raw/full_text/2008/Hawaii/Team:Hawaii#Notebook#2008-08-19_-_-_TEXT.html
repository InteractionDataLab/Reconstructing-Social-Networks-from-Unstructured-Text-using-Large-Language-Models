Things we did today
Wetlab work
RE test
Krystle
Checked to see if RE are still active by cutting R0010 with EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI individually
Ran on 2% agarose gel
R0010 was probably from a plasmid prep where cells did not lyse, i.e. no DNA in prep
Oops, forgot to run uncut plasmid as control
Set up new RE digest (w/ C0012) overnight to check enzymatic activity
Also checked EcoRI enzyme in TKW box of lab freezer
Verification of transformants
Grace
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Thirty microliters of RE digest and ten microliters of PCR reaction were loaded into each lane.
Plasmid prep of BB-pRL1383a+J33207 plasmid to verify replacement of GFP with J33207 (lac device)
PCR of BB-pRL1383a+J33207 plasmid preps
Negative = water
Positive = BB-pRL1383a
Ran on 2% agarose gel
No replacement of GFP; enzymes didn't cut?
