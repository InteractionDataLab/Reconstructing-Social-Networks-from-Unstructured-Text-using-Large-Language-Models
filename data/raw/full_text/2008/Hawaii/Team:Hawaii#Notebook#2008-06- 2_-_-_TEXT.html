Made Competent Cells
Grace, Margaret, Norman
Seed Stock
Tested OD600 of 1 seed stock tube @ 16 hr after innoculation
OD600 = 0.53244
Separated each 1.8 mL seed stock tube to two 0.9 mL tubes
Original cryotubes = 2 mL, which is not big enough for addition of glycerol later
Next time, perhaps use other type of tube (cryotubes don't allow air for E. coli to grow)
Incubated at 37C with shaking for additional 3 hrs
Protocol suggests 23C but growth was too slow. Also, protocol is for Mach10 cells, which grows much faster.
Added 158.8 ul glycerol to 6 seed stock tubes per compentency protocol
Added 327.8 ul glycerol to 15 seed stock tubes (26.7% glycerol) per SC's recommendation
Growth curve
Took one 0.9 mL seed stock tube prior to additional incubation and added to 90 mL SOB media
Tested OD600 every hour for 90 mL SOB mixture and 250 mL SOB mixture made yesterday
Growth until OD = 0.3 - 0.6, cells then made competant
OD600 is ideal for measuring Mach10 growth; OD550 should be used for DH5-α (citation?)

Growth of DH5-α from seed stock
Added one 0.9 mL seed stock to 90 mL SOB and checked growth (OD550 & OD600) every hour

Competent Cells
Competent cells prepared according to protocol based on Hanahan
Competent cells were made from stocks w/ OD600 = 0.33753 and 0.57673
250 ul chilled CCMB80 was added to each 50 ul aliquot of OD600=~0.6 to get final OD600 = 1.0-1.5
100 ul competent cells were aliquoted into each tube and stored at -80C

Competency test tomorrow morning
Test transformation of E. coli w/ PRL1383a Thursday if cells made are competent
Okay to grow up E. coli cells (for inducing competency) from seed stock?
