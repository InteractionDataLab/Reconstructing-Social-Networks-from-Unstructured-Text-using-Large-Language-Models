Results
Colony PCR. Ten microliters of colony PCR reactions were loaded into each well of an EtBr stained 4% agarose gel ran at 95V for 50 min.
Attempt #1
Transformation into DH5α
Sixty colonies were observed for GFP fusion and there were too many colonies to count (>300) for the modified pRL1383a.
Verification of transformants
A colony PCR was conducted to verify the presence of the GFP fusion brick containing plasmid and the modified pRL1383a. PCR products observed on the gel were of the expected size. One band was observed for pRL1383a (MCS=~50bp + ~250bp(upstream/downstream verification regions)) and the GFP fusion brick (720bp + ~250bp(upstream/downstream verification regions).
Sequencing
Sequencing by the Greenwood Molecular Biology Facility returned the following sequences:
GFP fusion
pRL1383a multiple cloning site
Sequencing returned results that did not match the expected VF-VR from B0034. When Blasted against the parts registry as well as the NCBI database, no significant results were found. Currently, we have no idea what the sequence is. The read was dirty so perhaps the results were just that of a bad read sample?
Attempt #2
Restriction digests
EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel ran at 59V for 90 min. Twenty microliters of the restriction digest reactions were loaded into each well.
Smear between 8-10kb may be due to too much pRL1383a plasmid? Two bands were observed for the RE digest of the J33207 PCR product. One band, ~1kb, is the size of the expected DNA fragment. The larger band, ~9kb, is yet unidentified.
Transformation into DB3.1
Five colonies were observed for the modified pRL1383a.
Sequencing
Sequencing by the Greenwood Molecular Biology Facility returned the following sequence:
pRL1383a
GFP was inserted into pRL1383a instead of the lac device for blue/white screening. Plasmid prep from which J33207 was extracted was mislabeled. Explains why colony PCR band was closer to 900bp than 800bp (GFP is 100bp larger than the lac device).
Discussion
Success! GFP fusion has been added to BioBrick registry and will be submitted at a later date. Need to redo pRL1383a assembly.
ccdB has a BamHI site within the gene. Oops! Switch to J33207 (lac promoter + rbs + lacZ) for screening of successfully ligated plasmid in transformants.
The pRL1383a MCS was successfully replaced with a BioBrick MCS and part. However, due to a mislabeling error, J33207 was not inserted into pRL1383a. A digestion of the modified pRL1383a with EcoRI and PstI will be carried out to introduce J33207 into the plasmid for blue/white screening of transformants.
