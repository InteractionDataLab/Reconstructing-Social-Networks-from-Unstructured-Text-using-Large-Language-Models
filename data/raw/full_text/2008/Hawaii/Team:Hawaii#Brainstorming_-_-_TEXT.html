Part A
Create a broad-host-range plasmid shuttle vector for transformation via conjugation from pRL1383, a derivative of the mobilizable broad host plasmid RSF1010.
RSF1010 is known to be able to transform a number of gram negative bacteria, including E.coli and several strains of cyanobacteria.  It contains streptomycin and sulfonamides resistance and oriV, for origin of vegetative replication, and oriT, for relaxation complex and origin of conjugational DNA transfer. The origin of replication oriV and the protein products of repA, repB, and repC are essential for its vegetative replication. The origin of conjugal transfer, oriT with the protein products of mobA, mobB and mobC, are essential for its mobilization via conjugation.
