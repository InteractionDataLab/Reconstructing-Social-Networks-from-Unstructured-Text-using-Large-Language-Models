Things we did today
Wetlab work
Checked Re-streaked Transformation
Margaret
The results are here
Plasmid prep
Grace
EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel. Twenty microliters of each restriction digest reaction were loaded into each well.
Plasmid prep for nir+B0034, GFP+B0024, GFPf+B0024
Digested today's plasmid preps and E0026 and J33207 with EcoRI. Ran on an EtBr stained 1.2% gel to verify. (E0026 and J33207 may have been mixed up as we realized when sequencing returned CFP as the result for the lac part.)
The newly labeled E0026 (plasmid+part=2841bp) and J33207 (2679bp) plasmid preps are okay but what are the four bands? Linear, ?, ?, supercoiled.
GFP+B0034 (2874bp) and GFPf+B0034 (2872bp) are too small on the gel. GFP(f) didn't go in? Bands look ~2100bp.
Drylab Work
Sequencing Analysis
Grace
All sequence reads are good (forward and/or reverse is of good enough quality to be a significant match against the original sequence) except for BB-pRL1383a. Need to reconstruct BB-pRL1383a because SpeI is the only BioBrick site identified and the insert is not that of BBa_B0034 (Could not ID what it was; blast search returned no results).
Updating Wiki Experiments
Margaret
I annotated some pictures and posted some finished experiments plus the plans for Construction of pRL1383a .
Plans for making the pRL1383a construct an inducible high copy number
Margaret
Started by annotating pSB2K3 on Vector NTI
