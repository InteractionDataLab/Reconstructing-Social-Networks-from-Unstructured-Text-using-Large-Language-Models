Things we did today
Wetlab work
Triparental conjugation (cont.)
Grace
PCR'd BBpRL cultures to ensure that plasmid was retained
Plasmid was not retained (grown in SOB w/o selection = no reason to retain plasmid)
PCR'd BBpRL colonies #1 and 18 from plate to ensure plasmid present
Regrew RP1, BBpRL harboring cultures in 20ml SOB with selection (Kan50 and Sp100 respectively) and incubated at 37C overnight, with shaking (rpm = 250)
Verification of transformants
Grace
EtBr stained 25 agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Two microliters of PCR product were loaded into each well.
