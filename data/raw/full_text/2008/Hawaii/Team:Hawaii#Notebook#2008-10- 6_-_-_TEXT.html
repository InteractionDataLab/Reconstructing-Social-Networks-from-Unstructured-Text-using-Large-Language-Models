Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of secretion device (cont.)
Grace
PCR'd nir, nir+rbs, rbs+GFP+tt#2, plac+rbs, slr1+GFPf
Verified PCR products on 0.8% agarose gel
Overnight RE digest:
EcoRI/SpeI:
nir
nir+rbs
plac+rbs
XbaI/PstI;
slr1+GFPf
pilA+GFPf+tt
rbs+GFP+tt#2
HindIII/BamHI:
J33207
OriV construction
Margaret
Ligation
oriV + pSB1A3 (de-phosphorylated)
Transformation into DH5-alpha, with amp100 selection
10/4 ligation
10/6 ligation
(+) control pUC18
(-) control no plasmid
PCR verification
colonies 5 and 6 were PCR verified
a gel was run
oriV1---> band at 400 bp
oriV2---> no band
oriV3---> no band
oriV4---> no band
oriV5---> band at 700 bp
oriV6---> band at 1000 bp
rep 2---> band at 3000 bp
plac/rbs/rep (colony 8)---> band <3kb (need to re-do this)
plac/rbs/rep and plac/rbs/aada
Margaret
plasmid prep of both constructs
Restriction digest for 2 hours at 37°C, then a gel was run to verify the digest
rep2 with X,P
plac/rbs/rep (colony 8) with X,P
plac/rbs/rep (colony 8) with E,S
plac/rbs/aada with X,P
PCR verification of more plac/rbs/rep colonies (14 total) and also colony 8 again to verify that I have what I think I do. (+) was pSB1A3, (-) was water
Drylab Work
Sequencing analysis
Grace
Correct:
rbs+GFP+tt #1, 2
BBpRL1383a:
All four sequenced colonies had a G->C single bp substitution at position 229 of part (in CAP binding site)
Colony 18 confirmed (best quality sequence)
Colony 1 confirmed (abiguities at 225, 583, 591, 552 of part)
Colony 3 (abiguities at 530, 513 of part)
Colony 13 (low quality sequence, but BioBrick MCS is present)
Incorrect:
nir+rbs+GFP #4, 7
nir+rbs+slr1+GFPf #8
No sequence obtained:
plac+rbs
nir+rbs+GFP #1
nir+rbs+slr1+GFPf #2
nir+rbs+pilA #17
