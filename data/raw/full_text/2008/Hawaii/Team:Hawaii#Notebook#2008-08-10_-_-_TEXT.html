Things we did today
Wetlab work
Checked DNA products via gel electrophoresis
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 72V for 100 min. Twenty five microliters of the RE digest reactions were loaded into each lane.
Grace
Ran RE digests on an EtBr stained 2% agarose gel at 72V for 100 min.
Picture really dark. Adjust camera? Restain with more EtBr tomorrow?
Resuspended plasmid preps from yesterday in 50 μl TE buffer and ran 5 μl on an EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel at 95V for 1 hour
Plasmid prep for I14032 (2008 distribution) was discarded. Solution was very thick (like egg whites) during resuspension, indicating high levels of proteins present.
Plasmids didn't run. Still really close up to to wells. Trouble shoot tomorrow.
Cryostocks
Grace
E. coli did not grow. Reinoculate tomorrow.
