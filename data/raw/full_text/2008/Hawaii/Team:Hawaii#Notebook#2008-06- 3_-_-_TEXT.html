Things we did today
Grace & Norman
Thaw test for PCC6803 and DH5-α
Made LB and LB + amp media
amp conc. = 100 μg/mL
Made 1000X amp stock solution, stored in 4C freezer
1000X = 100 mg/mL
Tested competency of DH5-α (see experiment)
Counted colonies to determine number of cells grown to OD600 = 0.3
Cells were cryoperserved, OD600 = 0.0748
10 μl were plated on each plate

Discussion
We have lots of cells (yay!). Cryofreezing will result in the loss cell population, but we will very likely still have viable cells after thawing.
