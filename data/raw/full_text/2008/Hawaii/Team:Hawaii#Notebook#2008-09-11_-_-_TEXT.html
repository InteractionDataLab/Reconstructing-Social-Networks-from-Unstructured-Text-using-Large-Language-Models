Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of p+r + s(+gf)
Grace
EtBr stained 4% agarose gel ran at 47V for 2.5 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digest reaction were loaded into each well.
Ran RE digests from last night on gel
Extracted DNA from gel
slr1, pilA, nir+rbs
(From yesterday) slr1+GFPf, pilA+GFPf (8/12 and 8/13 transformations)
Ligated:
pSB1A3 and nir+rbs with slr1, pilA, slr1+GFPf, pilA+GFPf (8/12 and 8/13 transformations)
nir+rbs (on SpeI/PstI digested pSB1A2 plasmid) with slr1, pilA, slr1+GFPf, pilA+GFPf (8/12 and 8/13 transformations)
plac+rbs (on SpeI/PstI digested pSB1A2 plasmid) with slr1, pilA, slr1+GFPf, pilA+GFPf (8/12 and 8/13 transformations)
Transformed into DH5α (3A ligations) or DB3.1 (2-way ligations) cells
Restriction digest
Krystle
20ul reactions:
RE digest 3 versions of GFPf+tt with XbaI + PstI
RE digest rbs+GFP with EcoRI + SpeI
Plasmid Prep
Krystle
5ml plasmid preps of nir, pilA, slr1 and slr2
