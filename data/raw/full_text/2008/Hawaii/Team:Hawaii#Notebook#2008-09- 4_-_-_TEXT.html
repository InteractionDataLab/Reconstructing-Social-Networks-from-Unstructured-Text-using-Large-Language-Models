Things we did today
Wetlab work
Re-replacement of BB-pRL1383a MCS
EtBr stained 0.8% agarose gel ran at 60V for 1.5 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digested BB-pRL1383a were loaded onto the gel.
Grace
Ran last night's RE digest on agarose gel
Extracted J33207 and BB-pRL1383a from gel
Treated BB-pRL1383a w/ SAP
Checked DNA concentration of BB-pRL1383a (---ng/μl)
Ligated J33207 with BB-pRL1383a
Negative controls = BB-pRL1383a ligated to self, J33207 ligated to self
Transformed into DH5α cells
3A construction of plac+rbs
Grace
Ligated:
C0012V (SAP treated) + plac + rbs (B0034 back ligation)
C0012V + plac + rbs (B0034 back ligation)
Negative controls = C0012V (SAP treated and no SAP treatment) ligated to self, plac + rbs ligated w/o vector
Transformed into DB3.1 cells
Cont'd construction of GFP + TT
Krystle
Transformed negative control and ligation product from Tuesday into DB3.1
Construction of B-H-R Vector Intermediates
Margaret
File:Re gel 9 3.jpg
Re-digest of RBS+Promoters, aada, psb3k3, psb1a3, J33207, and oriT's.
Ran a gel of Yesterday's restriction digest
Purified the bands that were the correct size, will re-do the others.
Set up cultures of constructs that did  not appear on the gel.
