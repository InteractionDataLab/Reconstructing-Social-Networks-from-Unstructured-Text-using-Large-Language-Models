Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of p+r + s(+gf)
Grace
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 47V for 2 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digest reaction were loaded into each well.
Ran last night's RE digest on gel
Could not resolve nir+rbs, plac+rbs, slr1, pilA (too little DNA? flanking bands also close to size of desired band)
Cut out slr1+GFPf, pilA+GFPf bands
Treated RE digested pSB1A3 with SAP
RE digest overnight:
EcoRI + SpeI:
nir+rbs (PCR product)
SpeI + PstI:
nir+rbs (plasmid prep)
plac+rbs (plasmid prep)
XbaI + PstI:
slr1 (PCR product)
pilA (PCR product)
Preparation for sequencing
Grace
plac + rbs colonies 1, 2, 10, 12 (#10 is potential successful transformant)
C0012 derived vector used in plac+rbs 3A ligation, dephosphorylated colony 2 and phosphorylated colony 1
slr1 + GFPf
pilA + GFPf, 8/12 and 8/13 transformations
