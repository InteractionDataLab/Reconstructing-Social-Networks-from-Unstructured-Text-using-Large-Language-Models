Agenda
Team Agreement (Gernot)
Presentations:
BioBricks "Other" (GK)
Plasmid (MR/NW)
Plan Part B
Margaret: cyan red dual plasmid system

Team Photo
After 9-10am meeting, Jamie will show the lab safety, chemical storage, etc walkthrough.
Minutes
Present: GK, KS, MR, SC, GP, KS, NW
Presentations:
File:Biobrick parts other.pdf (GK)
Other Parts (GK): Construction Intermediates, PCR Primers, Tags & Modifiers, Other Other Parts, Deleted Parts, Bacteriophate T7 Phage Parts & RNA Stabilizers.
Plasmid (MR/NW)
RSF1010 Overview: OriT, tra, mob overview
Proposed design, 4 BioBrick subcomponents
RNA Stability questions (regions past coding seq, how far do we PCR past carboxy terminus for possible RNA stability features? Are there any?)
Discussion regarding its usefulness (will be used by a lot of people)
Plan Part B
Margaret: cyan red dual plasmid system
Grace: lux operon night light
Krystle: bacterial export system, soluble proteins for crystallagraphy
Team Photo
Jamie showed us around the lab safety, talked about chemical storage, etc walkthrough.
Action Items
MR write up formal proposal with details on synthetic plasmid
E. coli grown and frozen, possible competent cell made
get autoclave trained
