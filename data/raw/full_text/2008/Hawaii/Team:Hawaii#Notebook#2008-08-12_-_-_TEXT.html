Things we did today
Wetlab work
Test of lab's RE (cont.)
EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel ran at 72V for 1.5 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digest reaction were loaded into each well.
Grace
Ran RE digests from yesterday on a 1.2% agarose gel
BamHI and HindIII digested DNA not visualized. Too little DNA added?
NotI works. All plasmid preps except I14032 resulted in 2 bands of the correct size.
Note: There is genomic DNA in all preps (band that looks like fire up top)
Verified transformants
Grace
Construct
Colony forming units
GFP+B0015(tt)
1
GFPf+B0015(tt)
52
slr1+GFPf
56
pilA+GFPf
43
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Five microliters of PCR reaction were loaded into each well.
Colony PCR of transformants to check for correct insert
GFP+tt = unsuccessful
GFPf+tt colonies 1, 3, 5 good
slr1+GFPf colony 5 potentially good
pilA+GFPf colonies 1, 2, 3, 4 potentially good
Ligated slr, pilA with GFPf (ES digested) instead of GFPf (XP digested). Still got colonies, some which are potentially good. Hm...
Restreaked:
GFPf+tt colony 5
slr1+GFPf colony 5
pilA+GFPf colonies 1 and 4
Will colony PCR again tomorrow to prep for sequencing
3A assembly
Grace
Ligated p+r with g or s onto pSB1A2
pnir+rbs with GFP, slr1, pilA
plac+rbs with GFP, slr, pilA
Transformed into DH5α using 5 μl ligation reaction
Rear ligation of signal sequences and GFPf
Grace
Ligated slr and pilA with XbaI and PstI digested GFPf
Transformed into DH5α using 5 μl ligation reaction
[[Editing Team:Hawaii/Notebook/2008-08-11|Transformation
Margaret
Re-streaked yesterday's transformation
Colony PCR on each of the re-streaked colonies
Construction of Omega Interposon
Margaret
Digested pSMC121 and pSB1A2 with SmaI
Ligated parts together (over-night ligation)
Plasmid Prep
Margaret
B0015, B0030, E0040, J33207
Drying in hood
Glycerol Stock
Margaret
oriT (3 bottles) and I14032 (1 bottle)
Media Making
Margaret
Amp100 plates, Solution 3 for plasmid preps, 100mM IPTG(look in -20C with the antibiotics)
Drylab Work
Sequencing
Grace
Downloaded sequences from CORE Hawaii. Began assembling contigs and checking sequences.
