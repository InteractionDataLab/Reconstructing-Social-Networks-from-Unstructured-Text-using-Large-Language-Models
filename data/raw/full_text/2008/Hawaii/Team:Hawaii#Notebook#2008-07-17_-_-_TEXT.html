Things we did today
Wetlab work
PCR
Grace
PCR products on an EtBr stained 4% agarose gel run at 119V for 27 min then 95V for 25 min. Ten microliters of PCR reactions were loaded into each well.
Colony PCR for GFP fusion brick and new pRL1383a to verify inserts
Sequencing (25 mu;l reactions)
nir promoter
slr2016
pilA
BBa_B0015
BBa_B0024
BBa_B0030
BBa_C0012
BBa_E0040
BBa_J04430
BBa_J33207
BBa_R001
Ran all PCR products on a 4% gel to check
Gel ran funny -- loading dye ran 2x as fast as the DNA itself
119V too much to handle? Wavy bands
Poor ladder resolution on gel
No bands seen for GFP fusion, pRL1383a, R0010
Incorrect bands for B0015 (multiple bands, what are the two bands at the top?) and J33207 (size too small, stuff still in wells)
Will redo plasmid preps for R0010, B0015, J33207
Will redo PCR reaction tomorrow for pRL1383a, GFP fusion, B0015, J33207, R0010
Plasmid Prep
Grace
Inoculated 7 ml LB + amp100 with single colony of B0015, R0010, J04430 for redo of plasmid prep tomorrow
Restreak to Purify
Grace
Restreaked GFP fusion and pRL1383a (MCS replaced) transformants to purify
pSB3K3 plasmid prep
