Judging Criteria Area Descriptions
Dear iGEM participants,  In order to group similar projects together so that they may be judged fairly, the judging committee has come up with the following area tracks:  Food or Energy Environment Health or Medicine Manufacturing New Application Foundational Advance Software  You can find descriptions of each track on the Judging Criteria page.  The judging committee hopes to award prizes in the above areas, conditional on the accomplishments presented by the teams. Each prize will be awarded at the discretion of the judges.   We ask that each team indicate their top three choices by sending an email to judging@igem.org.  Please remember to include your team name. The deadline is Wednesday October 8, 11:59pm EST.  Once the judging committee has received all of the team preferences and assigned each team to a track, we will post the assignments so that you may review which track you are part of.    Thank you,  iGEM judging committee
