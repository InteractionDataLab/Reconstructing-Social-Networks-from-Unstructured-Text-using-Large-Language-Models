Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of B_H_R Vector
Margaret
Yesterday's Restriction Digest
Plac+B0030 and Plac+B0034: ethanol precipitation [ [1] ]
pSB1A3, pSB3K3, J33207: de-phosphorylated using SAP
Gel Quantification
Gel purified quantification of restriction digest.
Some of these products did not appear on the gel, so other methods will be used to generate them.
Gel quantification of the Plac+B0030 and Plac+B0034.
Plac+B0030 and Plac+B0034 did not show up on the gel, so the ligation is being performed tonight, pSB1A3 and pSB3K3 plasmid preps from 9/4 showed a good band.
Ligation 1:1, followed by Restriction digest with E,S,& P (to cut up any polymers formed and to leave E & S overhang):
Plac + B0030 (500ng)
Plac + B0030 (100ng)
Plac + B0034 (500ng)
Plac + B0030 (100ng)
pSB3K3 restriction digested with E, P
OriT test
Margaret
The biobrick form of OriTr did not show up on the above mentioned gel, so I am:
PCR amplifying it from the biobrick paper
Extracting DNA from the biobrick registry (1004, 10D) and transforming into DH5-alpha cells. The negative control is pSB1A3-dephosphorylated, the positive control is pSB1A3, from a plasmid prep.
Culturing
Margaret
DH5-alpha (for making competent cells)
rep, J33207, pSB3K3, and omega interposon
