Culturing Protocol Optimization: CO2 is bottle neck, need incubator retrofitted (KS)
Express GFP constructs in Synechocystis
Near Term
Completed Milestones
2008.05.xx figure out OD Reading operation: Beckman 640U spectrophotometer (AB/NW)
2008.05.24 Create seed stocks for test transformation (NW/MR)
2008.05.22 Describe, present part types . 1.  Norman: biobrick assembly, parts, 2. Margaret: devices, 3. Krystle: chassis & plasmids, 4. Grace: other
2008.06.01 Plasmid Transformation Plan/Protocol (GK/MR)
2008.06.02 Create competent DH5a E. coli stocks (GK/MR/NW)
2008.06.03-2008.06.04 Plasmid Transformation, document results (GK/NW)
2008.06.04 GK and KS are now autoclave trained
2008.06.10 Fluorometer found (in Dr. Su's lab), 470nm blue LED lights purchased for constructing our own light table.
2008.06.11 First draft Work Breakdown Structure diagram drawn on whiteboard, detailing all deliverables. (please keep it updated)
2008.06.11 Does RSF1010 replicate autonomously in PCC6803? YES, only when it goes in cell as circle.  linear DNA need recombination.  Determined we need to test all three methods to find one that works: 1. Chemical 2. Electroporation 3. Conjugation (MR)
2008.06.12 Final draft of proposal due
2008.06.23 Transform PCC6803 w/ pRL1383a
2008.06.24 First batch of primers ordered
2008.06.24 Biobrick parts list completed
2008.06.24 RP1 and RP4 oriT are the same
2008.08.13 Replaced pRL1383a MCS with BioBrick MCS (GK)
