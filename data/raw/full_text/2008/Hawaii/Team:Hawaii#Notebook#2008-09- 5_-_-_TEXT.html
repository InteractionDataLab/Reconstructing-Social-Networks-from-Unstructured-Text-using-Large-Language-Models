Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of Broad-Host-Range Vector Intermediates
Margaret
Plasmid Prep: Everything that didn't work yesterday
2 Plac + B0030, 1 Plac + B0034, aadA(BB)colony 5, pSB3k3, pSB1A3
Restriction Digest: same as Yesterday
Ligation
Transformation into DH5alpha (we need more competent cells)
Verification of transformants from yesterday
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 83V for 1.75 hours. Two microliters of PCR product were loaded into each well.

Colonies
plac+rbs (no vector)
0
C0012 derived vector
12
C0012 derived vector, SAP treated
163
3A: plac+rbs+vector
>300
BBpRL1338a related plates all had a lawn (no distinct colonies observed). Too low antibiotic conc.? Will attempt to restreak/replate on Mon.
Colony PCR of 3A assembly related colonies
Oops. Loaded 1 μl colony #11 into colony #10's well
Colony #10 has potential. Will restreak on Mon.
Drylab Work
Sequencing
Margaret
Analysis of Sequencing submitted (oriV1-4, 2 aadA(BB), 2 aadA (pRL))
