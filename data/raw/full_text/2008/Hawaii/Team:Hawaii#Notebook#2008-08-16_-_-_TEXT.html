Wetlab work
Reconstruction of BB-pRL1383a (cont.)
Grace
EtBr stained 1% agarose gel ran at 60V for 2 hours. Thirty microliters of RE digested DNA were loaded into each well.
Ran digests on a 1% agarose gel
J33207 bands @ ~900bp and smudge ~100bp. ~100bp=VF/VR? Too much DNA loaded = band ran slower?
BB-pRL1383a band @ ~10kb. No band ~750bp. XbaI/PstI did not cut??
Extracted bands from gel
Ligated:
1 μl XbaI/PstI digested BB-pRL1383a with 3 μl XbaI/PstI digested J33207
1 μl XbaI/PstI digested BB-pRL1383a to itself (negative control)
Transformed into DH5α
Used 5 μl ligation reaction to transform
Plated on LB+sp100+X-gal and LB+sp100+sm50+IPTG+X-gal
To verify if IPTG is needed for lacZ expression
Plasmid preps
Grace
Resuspended plasmid preps in 50 μl TE buffer and stored in -20C freezer (long green tray)
