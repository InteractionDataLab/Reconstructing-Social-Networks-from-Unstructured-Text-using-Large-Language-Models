Things we did today
Wetlab work
Construction of p+r, r+g, g+t
Grace
Annealed oligonucleotides:
plac (I14032) for front ligation
rbs 1.0 (B0034) for back ligation
rbs 0.6 (B0030) for front ligation
tt (B1006) for back ligation
Ligated:
nir (SP cut) + B0034
plac + B0034 (EX cut)
B0030 + E0040 (EX cut)
E0040 (SP cut) + B1006
Placed in 37C water bath for 1 min, vortexed lightly, spun down before adding ligase
Transformed DB3.1 cells using 5 μl ligation reaction
BB-pRL1383a MCS re-replacement
