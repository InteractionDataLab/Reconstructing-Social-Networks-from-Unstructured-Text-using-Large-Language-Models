Things we did today
Wetlab work
Completed oligonucleotide experiment
Grace
The two expected bands corresponding to the vector and the BioBrick insert are clearly visible. First "good" plasmid prep!
Ran RE digested ligations on 4% gel. Too low DNA concentration so no ligated products were seen.
Redid ligation and RE digest. Loaded 20 μl in 4% gel.
RE digested C0012.
Gel extraction of C0012 vector and ligated products.
Ligated C0012 vector with pnir, slr2016, and pilA.
Biobrick extraction
Krystle
Extracted BBa_E0240 and BBa_I14032 using commercial grade DH5α super competent cells.
PCR of pRL1383a parts
