Things we did today
Drylab Work
Primer Design
Krystle, Margaret & Norman
We developed the standard method we will use to design the primers so they will be uniform. (need to post these guidelines on the public wiki)
Electroporation Protocol
Margaret
Posted electroporation protocol. It looks like this will be a viable option for introducing an autonomously replicating plasmid to Synechocystis PCC6803.
