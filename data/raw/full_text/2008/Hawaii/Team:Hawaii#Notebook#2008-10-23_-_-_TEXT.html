Things we did today
Wetlab work
Antibiotic test
Grace
No change from yesterday
Colony PCR of 6 colonies from sp40, 50, 75 and 8 colonies from sp100 plates
sp75,100 colonies correct
Restreaked sp2.5 blue colony, sp100 #1 & 2 on LB+amp100, LB, LB+sp100 + X-gal
Large scale plasmid prep
Grace
From sp100 plate: #1, 2
From 9/28 sp2.5 plate: #1
Gel showed no DNA in lanes migrated. Huh? Will try one more time to plasmid prep tomorrow.
Inoculated for plasmid prep
Grace
In 10 ml TB+amp100:
nir
nir+rbs
slr1
pilA
GFPf
slr1+GFPf
In 50 ml TB+sp100:
BB1 (sp100 plate)
Incubated at 37C for 18 hours with shaking at 250 rpm
Verification of transformants
EtBr stained 2% agarose gel ran at 95V for 1 hour. Two microliters of PCR product were loaded into each lane.
