Wetlab work
Transformation from last week
Margaret
Included in my last transformation were pSB1A3, de-phosphorylated pSB1A3, and restriction digested (E,P) pSB1A3. All had colonies on DH5 alpha, and I want to see what they are.
Colony PCR, 62°C annealing, 1 minute extension.
Run 2%gel to compare them to colonies of curious size. I will also run the 8 rep colonies from this transformation that I ran a PCR on yesterday.
PCR order: 2 pSB1A3, restriction digested (E,P) pSB1A3, & 2 de-phosphorylated pSB1A3, (+) pSB1A3 from a plasmid prep, and (-) water. All using VF2&VR primers.
Transformation of ligations into DH5α
Grace
Used 5μl of ligation reaction from yesterday
