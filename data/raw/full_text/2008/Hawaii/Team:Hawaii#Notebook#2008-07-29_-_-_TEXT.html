Things we did today
Wetlab work
Gel purification of ccdB PCR product
Grace
RE digests
Grace
Digested pRL1383a (from last night) with BamHI
Digested B0030 and B0024 (from last night) with EcoRI
Sequentially digested gel purified ccdB with HindIII and BamHI
Construction of BioBricks
Grace
EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel. Thirty microliters of each RE reaction and 10 microliters of ccdB were loaded into wells. Gel ran at 60V for 2 hours.
Purified RE digests on EtBr stained 1.2% agarose gel
Extracted bands for B0030 and B0024
Other lanes FAILED!
SYBR Safe doesn't show up well, even under UV (arg...)
Direct Band Extraction Method
Norman
make two comb gels
run test UPA band along with ladder
attempt to pipette out DNA as it runs into the second well
no more gel cutting???
PCR amplification of pRL1383a parts
Margaret
Made a reaction buffer containing {38.5ul, 20ul accusure, 10ul dNTPs, & 5ul 5XBuffer}. This should be good for 20 50ul reactions.
Amplified with Accusure: aadA ( BBa_J23012 ), aadaA (pRL1383a), rep region, oriV
Amplified with Green Taq: rep region
On 7-30 I ran a gel.
Media
Margaret
started to make LB amp100 plates, but autoclave room is closed. Remember to do it tomorrow.
Plasmid prep
Krystle
Innoculated LB+amp with pRL1383a harboring E. coli (from cryostock)
PCR
Krystle
PCR reactions to isolate GFP, GFPf, nir from plasmid
Discussion
SYBR Safe
Blue light still doesn't illuminate the bands well. No bands (not even the ladder) are visible. Resolution *much* better with short wave UV. EtBr better bet for now?
Restriction enzymes
HindIII and BamHI in the lab -20C freezer (in box labeled "TKW Restriction Enzymes") fail. They're really old and don't appear to cut well anymore. Digestion of pRL1383a resulted in a long smear.
