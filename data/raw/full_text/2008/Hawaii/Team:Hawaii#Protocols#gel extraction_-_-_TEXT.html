Gel Extraction
Using Qiagen MiniElute Gel Extraction Kit
Protocol
Cut band(s) from gel.
Determine weight of gel.
If weight of gel >400mg, run as 2+ extractions in different tubes.
Add Buffer QG.
For gels <2% agarose, add 3 gel volumes of QG.
For gels >2% agarose, add 6 gel volumes of QG.
Incubate at 50C, shaking every 2-3 minutes, until gel is dissolved.
Check the color of the solution is yellow. If the solution is orange, add 3M sodium acetate until solution is yellow (indicates neutral pH).
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol and mix by inverting.
Transfer solution to elution spin column (purple).
Centrifuge 1 min. at room temperature at 13,000 rpm.
Discard flow through.
Add 500 μl Buffer QG.
Centrifuge 1 min. at room temperature at 13,000 rpm.
Discard flow through.
Add 750 μl Buffer PE and incubate 2 min.
Centrifuge 1 min. at room temperature at 13,000 rpm.
Discard flow through.
Transfer spin column to fresh eppendorf tube.
Add 10 μl Buffer EB and incubate 1 min.
Add buffer directly onto filter in the spin column.
Centrifuge 1 min. at room temperature at 13,000 rpm.
Collect flow through and store at -20C.
Notes
DNA recovery is ~80%.
