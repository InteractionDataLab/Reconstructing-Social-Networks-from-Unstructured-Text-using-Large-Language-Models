Most lanes blank; lanes with bands are mostly faint. Didn't load enough PCR product? Will reload gel tomorrow with remainder of PCR product.

ap1, and ap2. Because I need to digest them with E,S so that I can use as a front insert
PCR Verification
Margaret
10 more colonies of plac/rbs/rep
check if SAP and SAP buffer is contaminated
