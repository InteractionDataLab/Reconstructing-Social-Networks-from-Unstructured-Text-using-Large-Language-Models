General Molecular Biology
A great textbook called Current Protocols in Molecular Biology available entirely online contains protocols for pretty much any molecular biology technique- great resource.
Polymerase Chain Reaction, Plasmids, and Recombinant DNA
PCR is the foundation for everything we will do ever. Below are some links on the basic principles and practice of pcr and related important topics; as we begin our own protocols those specific steps will be recorded here.
I would start here for a nice intro to the historical context of PCR.
The wikipedia page on PCR is good; I would skip the sections on 'variants' and history. Also their page on cloning genes into cells is good, and subcloning , all of which we'll probably end up using. And BACs and YACs .
A good animation on basic PCR , and an awesome animation on plasmid methods .
Decent explanation and some examples of Recombinant DNA techniques . A very very well done silent film on same.
The wikipedia page on gel electrophoresis , and specifically agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA, which you use to resolve and purify PCR products.
Something trippy .
Something not quite as trippy .
