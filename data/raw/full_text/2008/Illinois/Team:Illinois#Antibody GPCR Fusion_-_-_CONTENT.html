[2]. Activation of the GPCR by ligand binding begins a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the transcriptional activation or repression of one or more genes. The signal is transduced with G-proteins, which are signalling proteins that associate with GTP and GDP, as well as kinase cascades. Yeast cells are known to utilize two GPCRs signal transduction pathways, one to detect the presence of glucose and the other to initiate mating. We hope to engineer the well-characterized mating pathway to produce a colorimetric change in the cell upon detecting a novel molecule-- a surface protien of some water-borne pathogen, or possibly a toxin secreted by such a water-borne pathogen.

Rather than modifying the GPCR's target ligand, the addition of the Antibody on the N-terminus of the protein would act as a gate to allow or block binding in the original receptor domain. In this method, the addition of the AB on the end of the GPCR could conceivably:
</P><UL><LI>Block the normal binding site for the alpha factor, unless the AB was bound. After adding a LacZ or GFP gene under the control of the FUS1 promoter, if the yeast was not fluorescing, then we would know toxin was present.
</LI><LI>Vice versa; that is, if the AB was bound by the toxin it would block the binding of the natural ligand to the GPCR so the signal would not be induced. Thus, once production of LacZ or HIS or GFP halts we could know toxin was present.
</LI></UL><P>In either case we would modify the original GPCR gene with spacer dna attached to the antibody gene. After transforming the cells with that plasmid as well as the Fus1-GFP plasmid, we would test the mechanism by adding purified alpha factor to the solution. 
</P><P>Alpha factor has the effect of causing cell cycle arrest on MATa yeast, through the very same pathway. This would obviously have adverse affects on our cell cultures; in order to prevent this, we will have to knockout the Far1 gene.
</P><P>Once we know the original working parts are in order, rounds of directed evolution, selecting for candidates showing the steric mechanism detailed, would be conducted. DE should be more focused on the AB chain, leaving the receptor mostly untouched.
</P><P>It seems the most important variable, outside of the directed evolution, is the length of the spacer dna. It must be long enough so that the two fused proteins can fold without interfering with each other, as well as the correct length so that the AB may cover the ligand binding domain. I think alpha factor typically binds to the 3rd extracellular loop of GPCR.

We might be better off somehow obtaining a gene containing the natural GPCR (perhaps from a research group) and inserting the gene of the antibody.
</LI><LI> Professor Chris Rao explained to us an online tool (it was some company) for determining what restriction enzymes and where in the gene they could act to aid us in this.
</LI><LI> One yeast Ste2 gene was sequenced to be ~1.5kb, including restriction sites for EcoRI and BamHI [9].
</LI><LI>Express the antibody/GPCR fusion protein in yeast that lack the wild type receptor.

Three of each type have their Ste2 gene knocked out; the other 3 likewise have their Ste3 gene knocked out. Each costs about $150, in addition the media for their growth conditions is listed, WOW!
</LI><LI>MATa expresses Ste2 (the alpha-factor receptor) while MATalpha expresses Ste3 (the a-factor receptor) [1]. We should thus either order MATa without Ste2 or MATalpha without Ste3.
</LI><LI>Which mating type would better suite our purposes?
</LI><LI>The gene will most likely be on a plasmid. We may have to integrate the gene into the yeast's chromosome, however.
</LI><LI> The size of the gene may be substantial, if it turns out to be too large for a plasmid, integration into the yeast chromosome may be the way to go (hopefully not).
</LI><LI> [9] cites that a form of the Ste2 gene has been carried by a vector into yeast, size should not be a problem unless the antibody module is large.
</LI><LI>Measure the activation of the GPCR by the toxin (and by the natural pheremone) using a reporter gene.

</LI><P>
Alternatively, we might begin looking into completely replacing the yeast receptor with a mammalian or novel receptor with an affinity for our target protein. If we go down this route, we will also have to replace the G-alpha subunit with a chimeric one that has affinity for both the new receptor and the yeast G-betagamma complex. These have already been synthesized/cloned/will be fairly easy to procure, and may or may nor be receptor specific. This method is the major procedure for researching GPCRs today, typically used in pharmaceutical research -- knock out the pheromone GPCR while leaving the endogenous signal pathway/reporter intact, then introduce the uncharacterized GPCR of interest (with its G-aplha). In our case, we would not be studying an unknown GPCR to find what its target ligand or purpose is; instead we would simply already have one that we had/would evolve using mutagenesis to have an affinity for the toxin.

</LI><LI>&quot;The potency of some ligands might be reduced in yeast compared with mammals [for receptors taken from mammalian cells]. Using Gpa1–Ga chimeras probably explains part of this discrepancy [original yeast G-alpha subunits have low affinity for the new receptors and the mammalian G-alpha has low affinity for yeast G-betagamma, we will bypass this problem altogether by fusing the antibody to the original yeast receptor], but another factor might be the ability of ligands to penetrate the yeast cell wall. Potencies for small ligands are similar in yeast and mammals, those for intermediate ligands are about two orders of magnitude less in yeast, and large ligands such as chemokines (polypeptides with 70–80 residues) are often unable to activate receptors when applied exogenously to yeast. The fact that smaller versions of these ligands can be more efficient agonists suggests that accessibility is an issue.&quot;[1]

The individual pieces are Gα, Gβ and Gγ. When the appropriate molecule is bound to the receptor, the GDP bound to the Gα unit  becomes GTP. More conformational changes are induced causing Gβγ and Gα to dissociate. Depending on the signal cascade, either complex, Gα-GTP or Gβγ may now induce the appropriate linked signal pathway.
</P><P>As opposed to other signal receptors, the ligands that bind GPCRs typically bind within the transmembrane domain.
When the receptor is bound by its ligand, it shifts shape, activating the G protein (by allowing the exchang of GDP for GTP). Also, G protein complexes may or may not be coupled with the receptors, instead, if they happen across a receptor with its activating ligand bound, the G protein will be activated (GDP -&gt; GTP) and induce its signal cascade.
