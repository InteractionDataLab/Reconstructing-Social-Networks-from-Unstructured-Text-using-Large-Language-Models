Who are we?
We are the first Illinois iGEM team, and we're very excited about that fact.  Our team has a diverse mix of backgrounds drawing students from all over campus.  The represented departments include bioengineering, physics, electrical engineering, chemistry, and molecular and cellular biology.  This broad background gives us a the ability to look at problems from many angles and come up with unique solutions.  Under the guidance of our advisers we have been working to put together a project to bring to MIT this November.  We have all thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity that iGEM has given us, and look forward to being a competitive team in the future.
