Directed Evolution
Method for Directed Evolution and functional Cloning of Enzymens
Henrik Pedersen, Swen Holder, Daniel P, Sutherlin, Urs Schwitter, David S. King. and Peter G. Schultz. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 95, pp. 10523-10528, September 1998. [1]
Summary
Bacically give the methodology for preforming directed evolution on a specific enzyme, but can probably be adapted for any other protein provided we can isolate the ligand we are trying to isolate
The methods are very involved and complex, but are very specific for how to prepare substrates.
Create substrate with proteins to be identified and then create conditions so that only very specific bonding can occur. Get rid of elements that do not have a high bond affinity, then un-bond the proteins.
Note: Some one with more biology background might want to take a look at this, as it deals with really specific topics, that I do not have experience with. Also some relevant over-view things were highlighted.

Creation of GPCR-based chemical sensors by directed evolution in yeast
Addison D.Ault and James R.Broach. Protein Engineering, Design & Selection [2]
Relevance to iGEM: High
Subjects:
G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)specificity vs. sensitiyity
Directed evolution in GPCRs
Functional expression of heterologous GPCRs in yeast cells
Summary:
The authors took a Human GPCR and used simmilarites between yeast mating response pathways and the human signal transduction pathways to couple a human GPCR to the yeast pheromone respone pathway. They then used  random mutagenesis to create hybrids. Ultimately the hybrids were more sensitive, but had the same specificity for the compounds they sere tested on.

Bio-sensors
Construction of a Fluorescent Biosensor Family
Robert M. De Lorimier, J. Jeff Smith, Mary A. Dwyer, Loren L. Looger, Kevin M. Sali, Chad D. Paavola, Shahir S. Rizk, Shamil Sadigov, David W. Conrad, Leslie Loew and Homme W. Hellinga Protein Sci. 2002 11: 2655-2675 [3]
Relevance to iGEM: medium/low
Subjects:
bacterial periplasmic (between the cell wall and cell membrane) binding proteins (bPBPs);
fluorescence;
fusion proteins
Summary:
The authors took bPBPs and did two things to them: they mutated them to change their ligand specificity on a limited scale, and they attached a fluorescent domain to the bPBP so that ligand binding would cause a change in fluorescence without the need for a full signal transduction pathway.
The authors' main focus was on the fluorescence.  We could conceivably use this type of protein to accomplish the biosensor; however, the authors state that not much is known about the natural bPBPs, so it might be difficult to find a starting point in terms of a specific bPBP.

Functional expression of olfactory receptors in yeast and development of a bioassay for odorant screening

Relavent quotes
functional similarities between signal transduction cascades of G protein-coupled receptor in mammalian cells and the pheromone response pathway in yeast to develop a novel biosensor for odorant screening.
The aim of this study was to optimize the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host system for properly expressing an OR at the plasma membrane, and for its efficient coupling to a signaling pathway that produces a measurable response to odorant stimulation.
The yeast system was chosen for several reasons. Firstly, S. cerevisiae has been successfully used for functional expression of many GPCRs [22–28]. Secondly, yeast constitutes an attractive system to study membrane receptors providing a null background for mammalian GPCRs and G proteins. Finally, yeast cells may provide a means for detailed investigation of receptor pharmacology in vivo through the use of sensitive reporter systems that take advantage of the functional homologies between yeast pheromone and mammalian GPCR signaling pathways.

Salmonella and salmonellosis
Kenneth Todar University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Bacteriology [8] genus Salmonella has three kinds of major antigens with diagnostic or identifying applications:
Somatic (O) or Cell Wall Antigens
20 types of Antigen O
O antigen results in partial loss of virulence, suggesting that this portion of LPS is important during a host-parasite interaction
Surface (Envelope) Antigens
Surface antigen that is well known: the Vi antigen. The Vi antigen occurs in only three Salmonella serovars (out of about 2,200): Typhi, Paratyphi C, and Dublin
Flagellar (H) Antigens
Mixing salmonella cells with flagella-specific antisera  gives a characteristic pattern of agglutination (bacteria are loosely attached to each other by their flagella and can be dissociated by shaking)
[9] This website has a description of all the current tests used to detect Salmonella Typhi:
Widal tube agglutination test: involves the use of bacterial suspensions of S typhi and S paratyphi `A' and `B', treated to retain only the 'O' and 'H' antigens. These antigens are employed to detect corresponding antibodies in the serum of a patient.
Typhidot: allows separate evaluation of the presence of specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) g and m antibodies to OMP (50 kDa Outer membrane protein). Identification of specific IgG but not IgM in the serum of a febrile child is taken as a positive result.
Serotype Typhi IgM dipstick assay: based on the binding of S. Typhi specific IgM antibodies in samples to S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen and the staining of bound antibodies, by an anti-human IgM antibody, conjugated to colloidal dye particles.

Host strain influences on supercoiled plasmid DNA production in Escherichia coli: Implications for efficient design of large-scale processes.

Summary:
Set out to investigate if E. coli genotype plays a significant role in host strain selection for optimal processing of plasmid DNA based on both quality and quantity of supercoiling
17 E. coli commercial and non-commercial strains were selected and their available genetic backgrounds were researched in the open literature. Growth characteristics of all the strains were considered and made impartial by using a common medium and growth condition platform.
Can screen the number of strains which are likely to give good productivity early on, before any further optimisation and verification is performed, both for small and large plasmids.
Found that high specific growth rates of some strains did not affect the level of DNA supercoiling but did influence the total plasmid yield, potentially an important aspect in the design of fermentation strategy. Interestingly, a few host/plasmid combinations result in what appears to be runaway plasmid replication.
Potentially helpful for deciding strains to use to amplify plasmids

Yeast Cell Wall
Functional analysis of heterologous GPCR signalling pathways in yeast
Graham Ladds, Alan Goddard and John Davey Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK
This article is the one that brought the cell wall to light as a potential problem for our purposes
It claims that "Potencies for small ligands (Mw 1000) are similar in yeast and mammals, those for intermediate ligands (Mw 5,000) are about two orders of magnitude less in yeast, and large ligands such as chemokines (polypeptides with 70–80 residues) are often unable to activate receptors when applied exogenously to yeast."
C5a Receptor Activation
Thomas J. Baranski, Paul Herzmark, Olivier Lichtarge, Basil O. Gerber, Joshua Trueheart, Elaine C. Meng, Taroh Iiri, Søren P. Sheikh, and Henry R. Bourne From the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143 and Cadus Pharmaceutical Corporation, Tarrytown, New York 10591-6705
This article is one of the articles cited by the previous article
The GPCR used was activated by C5a, a chemokine.
The only mention of the cell wall is:
"A separate plasmid ... allowed autocrine expression of the C5a ligand as an a-factor prepro/C5a ligand fusion protein; autocrine expression was necessary because C5a cannot traverse the yeast cell wall."
