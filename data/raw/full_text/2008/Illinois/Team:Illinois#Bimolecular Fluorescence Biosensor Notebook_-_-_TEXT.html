TE Buffer Recipe
Uses
TE used to bring up oligos into solution
People who know how to do this
Joleen, Luke
Concentration
10mM Tris
1mM EDTA
pH 8.0
Method
For 500mL volume
Add: 0.1861g EDTA; 0.6057g Tris to 1 liter flask
Bring it up to 500mL with Deionized water (filtered in ---? container)
Put on "corning" mixer; get a larger stir bar from drawer and put on slow ~20 RPM rotation; no heat for 2-3 minutes until fully dissolved.
Standardize the pH meter (instructions on sign at prep bench)
Put gloves on; put pH electrode in flask but first add stir bar and put on low speed mixing
Bring pH to 8.0 (i.e. 8.00 +/- 0.05) by adding base (NaOH) or acid (HCl) in very small drops using a plastic pipette. (Wait for pH meter to eqiullibrate after each drop)
IMP: Put cap back on bottom of pH probe
Put coloured tape along side of flask and label with pH, name and iGEM
Cover it with heavy duty aluminium foil (just like a square inch to cover the top) and put a strip of autoclave tape along top of foil
Optional: out in big plastic autoclave bin
Bring to autoclave room; do not use the big "Beta Star"
Set on: 15 minutes; ~250 degrees Farenheit = ~121 degree Celcius; "liquid" run; for "operator #" just press enter; then "Run"; tubes = ~ 45 minutes; total to run since it must cool down and decompress
(Some extra side notes still to add)
TAE Buffer Recipe
TBE Buffer Recipe
1 liter of 5x TBE Running Buffer, pH 8.13-8.23
Materials
Tris-base - 54.0g
Boric Acid - 27.5g
EDTA - 2.92g
DI Water - 1.0L
Method
Stirred with stirring rod for 3-5 minutes
Agarose Gel

1st July
PCR Synthesis of BiFC Genes
from "PCR-based Synthesis of Long DNA Sequences" 2006 Nature Protocols
Attempted synthesis of Venus Fluorescent Protein halves (N and C term) fused to HIV gp41 epitope
Formed gene from ~50nt segment oligos at 30uM
PCR reactions as described in paper; 50uL reaction volume
'FivePrime MasterMix' PCR mix
PCR protocol as in paper for both N terminal
2nd July
Gel #1: Results from July 1 PCR
Each lane has 2uL orange/blue loading dye; 1% agarose gel
Lane 1: Hyperladder II; 2: 8uL C term whole rxn; 3: Cterm w/o leftmost oligo; 4: C w/o rightmost; 5: Just outer oligos 6-9: Same except N terminal fragments
60 minutes at 140 V then 10 min in EtBr dye
No great product
3rd July
Gel #2: again of July 1 PCR
all lanes have 2uL Loading dye; 1% agarose gel
Lanes 1+10=ladder; 2+4=8uL whole N term gene; 6+8=8uL C term gene
again, very fuzzy, impure product
8th July
Agarose Gel Purification of Oligos
Made 4% Agarose gel with 8g Agarose, 40mL TBE, 160mL H2O
Made 2% with 4g Agarose
Microwave for 1:35 for optional warming
Ran total of 2 hours on 80 Volts -> --? (decent?)
TAZ side project
Adam Z streaked 4 plates with High Elu, Amp m100, Taz Ecoli
Check for growth tomorrow
Gel Extraction Protocol
Use microscope slide to cut gel out
Visualize on Bio unit with plastic shield from drawer below unit attached to slide out unit
Amount of gel collected(into 1.5mL tubes)
Oligo #2: 0.0671g -> 402.6g
Oligo #3: 0.062g -> 362.0g   Oligo #4: 0.1062g -> 637.2g   Oligo #5: 0.0747g -> 448.2g   Oligo #6: 0.0585g -> 351.0g   Oligo #7: 0.0601g -> 360.6g   Oligo #8: 0.0440g -> 264.0g   Oligo #9: 0.0482g -> 289.2g
9th July
Cells were found in small colonies -> decided to let them grow for 24 more hours
Plated 4 more E.coli strains with Xgel (spread)
Cultured 4 vials of E.coli with X gel
Check back in 36 hours
9th July
PCR amplification of July 1 PCR
Hope to get more product, specifically C terminal half
half of 50uL of pcr reaction volume obtained as 'oligo mix'
Tube 1: 25 uL oligo mix +1uL of each outer oligo + 20uL Mango MasterMix
Tube 2: 3uL of oligos 1-5, plus 20uL MasterMix; 50uL total volume with added water
Tube 3: 3uL oligos 6-10 plus 20uL MasterMix
9th July
Gel #4: Analysis of July 9 PCR
1% Agarose gel
Lane 1: Hyperladder II; 3: 8uL C-term protein (tube1); 5:  8uL tube2; 7: 8uL tube3
Run 50 minutes at 140 Volts
Again, lackluster: huge streak seen above and below where we expected product
Try Again
11th July
Temperature-gradient PCR of Unpurified Oligos
Below is the gel of this reaction at different annealing temps
1% agarose gel, run for 50 mins at 140V
Lane 1: Hyperladder II; 2: 10uL from rxn with 50° annealing temp; 3: 50.9°; 4: 52.8°; 5: 56°; 6L 58.8°; 7: 59.8; Lane 8: 0.6uL 100bp ladder
Some improved results in mid-range of annealing temp, but clearly have grossly impure product and need to regroup
Try purifying the 50nt oligos we ordered: likely only ~50% pure from factory
14th July
PAGE Purification of Oligos
10% premade PAGE gel w/ 10 50uL wells
added 40uL of each oligo to well and 8uL loading dye
Just did this for C terminal protein; also only the inner oligos since the outer are smaller and probably already pure
Lane 1 and 10 ladder; lanes 2-9 correspond to oligos 2-9 respectively for the C term protein synthesis
Loaded into PAGE chamber
Ran for 70 mins at 140V
Very smeared results-> used too much volume in each well
15th July
Redo of PAGE Purification of Oligos
Same as July 14th protocol except used 20uL of each oligo instead of 40uL to prevent overflowing
Also used 10uL and not 8uL loading dye
Ran for 30 minutes at 200 Volts
Put in EtBr dye for 15 mins and imaged
HUGE streaks for each of our products; either gel was run poorly or we have like 10% purity of oligos
Conclusion: this PCR gene synthesis method will not work
Review literature for other approaches
20th July
Obtained a Citrine Fluorescent protein from UIUC Rao lab
On bacterial plasmid
Will use instead of synthesizing whole gene de novo
Sequence known so can design overlapping primers from our 'novel' part of the gene
Instead of fusing HIV gp41 fragment to each FP half, will fuse a poly (6X) His tag
Model system to evaluate BiFC assay: His-tag fused to each FP half
Bound by mAb against PolyHist -> complementation (hopefully)
30th July
NEW Gene Synthesis Protocol
From 'Gene2Oligo' tool available online
Breaks gene up into ~40nt chunks but OVERLAP FULLY so that even impure oligos can create pure product
AminoAcid Sequence: overlap CFP from Rao lab-> 20AA flexible peptide linker-> PolyHis Tag-> stop
This ~100 nt sequence will be synthesized de novo w/ Gene2Oligo Method
Ordered 6 oligos of ~40nt, brought to 20uM
PCR as described by Gene2Oligo paper:
0.1uM final oligo concentration, plus FivePrime MasterMix, plus 25mM MgCl2, plus water to 50uL
First performed the Gene2Oligo 'synthesis' step of the protocol
31 July
Gene2Oligo 'Amplification' Step
As described in paper: 50 uL pcr tube; 20uL MasterMix, 1.5 uL of each 30uM outer primer, 3uL of rxn from July30, plus MgCl2
Ran w/ PCR reaction from paper
Product added to gel from other IGEM expt: AWESOME, dark, perfect band right where we expect it
This method works to synthesize at least smaller (~100nt) segments
Also, we have a functional collection of the His-Tag, linker, overlap gene
Next step: amplify out the CFP from the plasmid to fuse to this
5th August
PCR Amplification of Citrine Fluorescent Protein
Ordered primers brought up w/ water to 300uM
In each PCR tube: 30uM final concentration of each (forward and reverse) primer, 20uL MasterMix, 1uL out of 50uL plasmid, brought up to 50uL total volume
PCR protocol: 90° for 50 sec; 50° for 50 sec; 72° for 1:45; repeat this for 30 cycles, then 72° for 5:00, then hold at 4° for ever
6th August
Gel Electrophoresis of 5 August PCR
8uL PCR mixture plus 2uL loading dye
1.5% agarose gel at 200V for about 50 mins
EtBr visualization
Very dim band where we expect product, also a couple other dim bands
Bad gel? Or bad PCR
6th August
Revised PCR Protocol for CFP Amplification
Same mixture in tube as August 5th
BUT: Initial denaturation at 94°C for 2:00
then: 94° for 1:00, 47° for 1:00, 72° for 1:00; repeated 25 times; then 72° for 7 mins, then hold at 4°
7th August
Gel of August 6 PCR
2% Agarose gel, lane 1= 100bp ladder; land 2= 8uL product + 2uL loading dye
EtBr then imaging, a little darker produce but still nothing great, probably not enough to transfect
3rd September
PCR Amplification of CFP: Round III
Two reactions using the same protocol as on the 6h of august, but with different PCR Mix:
20uL 5Prime MasterMix, OR 25uL MangoMix
7th September
Gel of PCR from September 3
1.5% agarose gel, run at 150 Volts for 50 minutes
Lane 1: loading dye and 5uL 100bp ladder; 2: 8uL MasterMix reaction; 3: 8uL MangoMix rxn
EtBr visualization
No great difference between the two pcr mixtures
Still no great product
8th September
One Last Attempt: PCR Amplification of PCR
Increased the concentration of primers: 60uM instead of 30uM
Also, used product from the reaction from September 3 instead of raw plasmid (amplify amplification?)
Same PCR protocol as on September 3 (except 45° annealing temp)
Ran 1% agarose gel for 50 mins at 150V
Lane 1: 5uL 100bp ladder; lane 2: 8uL above PCR product
Got a decent amount of product, but low purity-> huge smudge
Impurity possibly due to re-amplification step
Possible villain: low annealing temps
Solution: order new amplification oligos with higer temps for annealing
29th September
PCR Amplification of CFP Using Longer Primers
Longer oligos (~30nt each) used to increase melting temperature; brouth up to 30uM
PCR mix: 10uL 2X MasterMix (custom made by Matt); 15uL forward primer; 15uL reverse; 10uL PCR product from Sept 8
Same PCR protocol as from September 3, except annealing temp was set to 52° instead of 45
30th September
Agarose Gel of Sept 29 PCR
1% Gel run for 50 mins at 150V
Lane 1: 5uL Ladder; Lane 2: 8uL Sept 29 reaction product plus loading dye; lane 3 same as lane 2
Decent amount of product, but a lot of smearing
Possible cause: we again re-amplified an amplification instead of going from original template
30th September
PCR Amplification of Original CFP Plasmid with Long Primers
Same program as Sept 29 except set annealing temp to 55°C
Tube 1: 8uL MasterMix, 15uL forward long primer, 15uL reverse primer, 5uL plasmid, brought up to 50uL total
Control tube (2) had Mastermix plus control template and primers.
1st October
Agarose Gel of Sept 30 PCR
1% Gel run for 50 mins at 150V
Lane 1: 1kbp ladder; 2: 8uL reaction from sept 30; 3: control reaction from sept 30
EtBr staining then imaging
Way too much ladder (use less in future); also very promising but sort of dark band at ~750nt- Exactly where expected!
2nd October
Redo of Oct 1 Gel to Confirm Results
Lane 1: 2uL 1kBp ladder; 2: 8uL reaction from sept 30; 3: control from Sept 30
Still too much ladder, but otherwise success! Dark band at 750 again
Next step-> extract this band
5th October
Repeat of PCR Amplification of Original CFP Plasmid with Long Primers
Same program and reaction as October 2
Then do 1% gel at 150V for 50 mins, EtBr and visualize-> same band
Extract this next
7th October
DNA Extraction from Oct 5 Gel
'Invitrogen PureLink Quick Gel Kit'
Instructions followed directly from kit (see invitrogen website for details)
~150mg isolated from VFP gel around band (with 450uL volume used); also ~140mg from control gel (420uL volume)
Next: attempt to quantify DNA
[DNA] = 50 ug/ml * Dilution Factor * OD260
Tube1 VFP amplification DNA: 0.0055ug/uL; Tube 2 control DNA: 0.186 ug/uL
Nice amount of DNA! Next-> clone this into our vector
