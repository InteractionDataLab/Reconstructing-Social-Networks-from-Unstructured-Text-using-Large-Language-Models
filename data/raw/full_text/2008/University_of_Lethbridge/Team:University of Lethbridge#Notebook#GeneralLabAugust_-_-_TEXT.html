Gel extracted two bands really closer to each other from PCR (August 1) at ~76 bp. Used Qiagen MiniElute kit. Results are in the hard copy lab notebook. Seems as if gel extraction was successful. ____ 2 color reporter system:
Set up digest of LacI and DT.
LacI - EcoRI and SpeI
DT - EcoRI and XbaI
Reaction mixture:
-5 uL template -5 uL NEB 2 Buffer -0.5 uL BSA? -1 uL RE #1 -1 uL RE #2 - 37.5 uL ddH20
Left at 37 C overnight. Heat deactivation (65 C) for 15 minutes.

2 color reporter system:
Gel extracted LacI insert and DT vector. Didn't run gel yet.

Nathan Puhl and Sebastian
Verified and quantified the LacI and DT restriction digest products.
Set up a Ligase experiment for LacI and DT
- 1.3 uL vector(DT) - 8 uL insert(LacI) - 2 uL 10x Ligase buffer - 1.5 uL Ligase - 7.2 uL ddH2O - 20 uL total volume

Used Qiagen Plasmid MiniPrep Kit to Plasmid Prep Last Year's Biobrick Parts that were Incubated overnight.
Ran Plasmids in a 1% Agarose Gel at 100 V for 30 minutes.
Christa, Munima, Sebastian
Did a plasmid prep on pSB1A7 using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. Stocked 4- 50uL of pSB1A7 and stored in iGEM -20 C.
Sebastian, Nathan Puhl
Ran products from plasmid prep (pSB1A7 x 4 samples) on 1% agarose gel for 27 minutes.
-Lane 1 - 1 kb GeneRuler ladder (2 uL) -Lane 2 -6 pSB1A7 (3 uL) + 6x loading dye (2 uL); Mixed up what sample was in Lane 4, so Lanes 5 and 6 were run.
Conclusion: The bands appeared to be at the correct size for pSB1A7.

Objective: Run a gel to confirm that appropriate inserts were amplified from the PCRs and do a gel extraction of the inserts to prepare them for the biobrick format.
-Could not obtain a picture of the gel (1% agarose) of the half of the digested pSB1A7 (15 uL x 3 wells) and  the recently amplified  CheZ gene (15 uL x 3 wells) because the camera would not turn on.    The CheZ gene appeared at the correct size (~700 bp). -Did a gel extraction of pSB1A7 and CheZ from that gel with the Qiagen MiniElute Gel Extraction kit.  Final volume of each was 10 uL. -Ran another 1% agarose gel to confirm that the gel extraction was successful. Ran 1 uL of each sample.  Bands appeared at appropriate sizes. The concentrations of pSB1A7    and CheZ were estimated to be 25 ng/uL and 80 ng/uL, respectively.
Next step: Digest pSB1A7 with antarctic phosphatase. A restriction digest will be performed at a later date on CheZ to prepare it for insertion.

-Performed a restriction digest on LacI+dt, pLacI, pStrong, and RFP sub
-10 uL template -5 uL NEB 2 -2 uL Restriction Enzyme #1 (Xba I or Spe I) -2 uL Restriction Enzyme #2 (Pst I) -21 uL ddH20 ____ 50 uL Rxn left to run overnight at 37.0
-Ran a Gel of the Riboswitch PCR which had been done with Taq a couple of weeks ago to quantify the amount of DNA present. Setup the Math to perform a ligation into pGEM T-easy.
-Picked a colony from the dT plate which was stored in the fridge from several weeks ago, incubated overnight at 37.0C
August 29, 2008
