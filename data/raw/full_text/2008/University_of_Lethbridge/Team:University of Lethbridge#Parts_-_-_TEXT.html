CheZ - BBa_K147000
CheZ is an enzyme invovled in E.coli chemotaxis, dephosphorylating CheY which causes the flagellum to reverse rotation and produce forward thrust.  By regulating CheZ expression in the CheZ knockout strain RP1616, cell motility can be directed up a chemical gradient of choice.
xylE - BBa_K147003
The xylE gene from Pseudomonas putida encodes the enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase which catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde.  This reaction results in a vibrant yellow color in the cell.
ohb A - BBa_K147002
The ohb A gene produces a subunit of the ortho-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  This complex catalyzes the conversion of 2-chlorobenzoate into catechol
