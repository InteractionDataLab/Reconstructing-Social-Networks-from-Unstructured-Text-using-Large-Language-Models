Jaden
Objective: Grow up cells containing the xylE gene from the glycerol stocks and plates (Selina had transformed with DH5a) in LB + Amp liquid media. The gene was sent to us in pVL1392 (modified pUC8 for viral expression, with Amp resistance).
Subcultured four tubes: Two from glycerol stocks and two from colonies on a plate.
October 7, 2008
Christa, Munima
Objective: Plasmid prep the xylE gene that Jaden subcultured yesterday.
Christa: Plasmid prepped one subculture tube from 'glycerol stock' and 'plate' using the Eppendorf FastPlasmid Mini Prep Kit. Stored 50 uL aliquots in the -20 C iGEM freezer box (iGEM Plasmids) labeled "xylE from glycerol stock" and "xylE from plate", and have a big blue "P" or "G" on the top, respectively.
Munima: Plasmid prepped one subculture tube from 'glycerol stock' and 'plate' using the QiaPrep Spin MiniPrep Kit. Plasmids are stored in 50 uL aliquots in the -20 C iGEM freezer in the iGEM Plasmids box. They are labeled "xylE plasmid; plate 2; Oct. 7/08" and "xylE plasmid; glycerol 2; Oct. 7/08".

Ran gel to assess if gel extractions and plasmid preps worked. See gel for results. Plasmid preps of xylE yielded no results with the Eppendorf Kit, so use Qiagen kit from now on.

The chemical competency plates don't have much growth.
-1 colony on DH5a + pUC19 -8 colonies on BL21 DE3 + pUC19 -1 speck on RP1616 + pUC19
Obviously, the transformation didn't go too well. We will redo it with two sets of RP1616 cells, 1 BL21 and 1 DH5a.
The colony PCR of xylE had weird results on the gel. The subculture was plasmid prepped and run on a gel. We will redo a screening PCR of this if the size looks good.
-dephosphorylate pSB1A2 (XbaI, SpeI)  -then ligate CheZ into it -ligate pLacI + TetR -re-PCR ohb B, C and R (with higher annealing temperature) -re-PCR xylE in pSB1A2 with VF2, VR and xylE primers -setup restriction digest of ohbA with XbaI and PstI, and pSB1A2 with EcoRI and SpeI;     ng ChZ needed = 55.34; put 4.45 uL of CheZ into 1 uL of pSB1A2

For procedure:
- Used 13 uL of ohbC for 1 uL of pSB1A2 and 1 uL of ohbA for 2 uL of pSB1A2.
-Sequencing results were obtained for xylE.
October 25, 2008

-Transformation of ohbA and ohbC plasmids into DH5a.
October 26, 2008
Roxanne
-We have colonies!!!
-picked 3 of each and subcultured into LB + amp media. Incubated overnight at 37.0 C
October 27, 2008
Roxanne
-Plasmid prepped the ohbA and ohbC plasmids.
-Performed a screening PCR on the ohbA and ohbC genes using VF2/VR and the primers for the individual genes.
-ohbC came up a little short. Oops, forgot that there was a PstI restriction site in the gene. No time to redo with mutagenesis.
-Prepared ohbA_pSB1A2, xylE_pSB1A2 and cheZ_pSB1A2 to be sent off to the registry, and prepared ohbA to be sent of for sequencing.
