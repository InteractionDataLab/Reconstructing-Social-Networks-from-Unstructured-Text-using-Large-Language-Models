the project
BactaSun
Although melanoma accounts for less than 1% of skin cancer cases, they are responsible for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. More than 80% of melanomas are caused by the exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.
Our project: BactaSun, a bio-badge changing color when exposed to sunlight.

Global issue
Over the last years, our exposition to UV rays has increased and scientists noticed an upward trend in the risks of developing skin cancers.
Protection exists
Although we can protect ourselves against this health hazard, we cannot feel the UV rays and when sunburns appear, it is already too late.
Badge design
Hence, we have designed a wearable UV-sensitive badge to help warning people on their level of exposure anytime and anywhere. The badge turns red when exposed to a certain level of sunlight.
Culture design
This badge contains a liquid cell culture. The bacterial cells are engineered o produce a red fluorescent protein, which is only developed when. They only produce it when the badge is exposed to UV rays, thanks to a photocaged amino acid.
NB : bacteria free prototype
you think we're cool? so are our sponsors!
