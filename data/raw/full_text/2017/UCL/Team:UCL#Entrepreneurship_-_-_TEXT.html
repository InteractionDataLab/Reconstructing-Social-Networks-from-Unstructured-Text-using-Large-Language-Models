About Us
Light Induced TechnologiesLTD
Bringing urban design and synthetic biology together
We are forming a startup company, which will sell LIT bulbs. At LIT, we develop applications for biological light switches â€“ molecular devices that activate and suppress cellular processes. The LIT bulb uses the daily cycles of day and night to regulate its bioluminescence via a genetically engineered circuit. Making use of bacterial co-culturing, the LIT bulb provides an eco-friendly, cost-effective and aesthetically pleasing solution that is sustainable for the long term to light up the streets of London.
Introducing the LIT bulb
About us
LIT, Light Induced Technologies, is a London based company that combines                         the concepts of Synthetic Biology with Urban Design to create innovative technologies that address                         current world-wide issues. We are focusing on finding an alternative source of illumination, as all                         current methods have a large carbon footprint on our environment.
The implementation of our innovative and eco-friendly light bulb aims to                         minimize carbon emissions and satisfy the needs for private and public illumination.
