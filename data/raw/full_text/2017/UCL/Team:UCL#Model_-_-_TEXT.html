Click on one of the models to find out more about how we used genetic algorithms, cost analysis, parameter sampling and sensitivity analysis.
We created GOLIT, a cellular automata, to help people visualize the processes underlying the formation of 3D bacterial structures using our optogenetic tools. We incorporated a genetic algorithm to determine the optimum light pattern one should shine onto our cells to create a 3D structure as quickly as possible.

We created LEGIT to determine the optimum light intensity required for our cells to produce the maximum amount of surface proteins in the least amount of time.  This increased the speed and efficiency  of our 3D structure generating optogenetic tool. By incorporating parameter sampling, our results could accurately inform our Wet Lab team on the range of light intensity levels we should examine in our experiments for Barchitecture.

We created MOM to determine the conditions required for rapid photoclevage and photoactivation of gene expression in mammalian cells.  We determined the range of light intensities that should be tested in the lab to create a rapid structure generating optogenetic tool.

We created OptoFlux to determine the optimal dimensions for our LIT bulb. The LIT bulb achieves the same light intensity as a conventional 160W light bulb. The dimensions generated from our OptofFlux model allowed for enough sunlight to reach our cells, while at the same time allowing for the luminescent produced by our bacteria to reach their surroundings.
