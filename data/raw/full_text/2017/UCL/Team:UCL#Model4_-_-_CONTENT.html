                light activated expression of the protein intimin. Intimin is a protein expressed on the surface of our genetically
                engineered E. coli cells. We use intimin as an anchor onto which we fuse our binding partners, SpyTag and SpyCatcher.
                Once the SpyTags and SpyCatchers have attached to a particular cell they start to bind to SpyTags and SpyCatchers
                on other neighbouring cells. We control this process using light. This intracellular binding allows our cells to aggregate
                into shapes. In order to control the amount of binding that takes place between our cells we  need to control the
                amount of intimin expressed on the surface of our cells. LEGIT enables us to define the optimal conditions that should be
                used by our Wet Lab in order to increase the expression of intimin on the surface of the cells by 16%.

                    continuously transported to the surface of the E. coli cell, therefore intimins' concentration in the cell also decreases. To account

                    This is because as time passes there will be a decrease in available space for intimin on the cell surface. We adapted the
                    Michaelis Menten equation to allow for the consideration of: the intimin proteins already occupying space on the cell surface; (P<SUB>Surface</SUB>)

                    because the heat exerted from the higher light intensities denatures our cells.

                and rate of expression of intimin on the surface of the cell, we decided to evaluate the effect other light properties would
                have on our system. More specifically, we decided to evaluate whether light pulsing had an effect on intimin expression.
                This would allow us to see whether continuously activating and deactivating our light induced system could result in the expression
                of a larger concentration of intimin on the surface of the cell.

                We first ran a control simulation, where we introduced one long pulse of 7 hours of light, in order to
                ensure we received a curved response that would simulate the activation and deactivation of our cellular mechanisms
                for a defined period of time.</P><P class="text-figure">Figure 14: Evaluates the effect a single pulse has on the rate

                    of intimin, is represented in a dumb-bell shaped curve. This is justifiable, as when the light is turned off we
                    expect the rate of product production to be smaller than the rate of product degradation. Therefore, as time passes
                    the concentration of each product from each step is expected to decrease.

                     We then wanted to evaluate the effect pulsing for periods of 4 hours would have on the expression of intimin
                    on the surface of the cell.</P><P class="text-figure">Figure 15: Demonstrates the effect pulsing light, at 4-hour intervals,

                    within 24 hours, we experienced more than a 10-fold increase in the concentration of intimin expressed on the

                    value of K<SUB>m</SUB> the higher the affinity our cells’ membranes would have for intimin and therefore the faster the
                    transport of intimin to the cell surface. In addition, the higher the V<SUB>max</SUB> the faster the rate at which the reaction

                    the desirability of a company’s shares (set as a function of the market share a company has); and a company’s share price.
                    A decrease in the Lombard rate would result in an increase in the share price of a company, which would lead to an increase
