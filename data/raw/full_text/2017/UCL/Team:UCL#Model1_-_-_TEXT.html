The science behind GOLIT
GOLIT is a model that creates a visual representation of how solid cell structures                      can be formed by inducing the expression and binding of SpyTag and SpyCatcher, which are expressed on the surface                     of our E.coli cells and are explored in our Barchitecture section. GOLIT is inspired from Conway’s Game of Life.
We are modelling a cellular automaton to dynamically represent the adhesion of cells.
We started by collaborating with the Wet Lab team to engineer E. coli cells to express the surface protein intimin.
Then we got the binding partners                     SpyTag and SpyCatcher to attach to the surface protein (this expression system is modelled in the LEGIT model ).
When SpyTag and SpyCatcher from neighboring cells are in close proximity to each other they form a covalent bond. This allows cells to aggregate and form bacterial structures.
With GOLIT we are simulating how the concentration of SpyTag/SpyCatcher,                         expressed on the surface of the cells, influences the rate at which cells adhere to each other. We obtained the different                         concentrations for SpyTag/SpyCatcher from our LEGIT model, where different concentrations of SpyTag/SpyCatcher                         were expressed depending on the light intensity used to photoactivate the cellular mechanism.
How did we adapt the Game of Life?
Similar to Conway's Game of Life, we are representing the cells on a 2D grid so when running the model,                     the cells are constantly updated over a defined period of time.                     In the GOLIT model the cells can either be in the “bound” or “unbound” state. Our game requires the user to define the state of all the cells on the grid                     and update the grid according to a set of rules for each time point. The state of a cell at a particular                     time point depends on the state of its neighboring cells as well as the concentration of SpyTag/                     SpyCatcher expressed on the surface of the target cell.
The rules below assign probabilities of one cell becoming "bound" depending on the                     number of 'bound' neighbors surrounding it.

Combination of ODE and Cellular Automata
Aim: Determine which light intensity allows for the fastest cell aggregation, i.e. binding of SpyTag and SpyCatcher
The particularity of the GOLIT model lies in fact that we are combining rate kinetics of protein expression with cellular                     automata for spatial analysis. The concentration of SpyTag and SpyCatcher expressed on the surface of the engineered E. coli                     cells is critical for the efficiency of cell adhesion. The LEGIT model uses rate kinetics to model the rate of intimin expressed                     on the surface of the bacteria for light intensities within the range 0-70 W/cm2.
For the purpose of this model we are assuming that the concentration of intimin expressed corresponds                     to the amount of SpyTag/ SpyCatcher on the surface of the cells. Since updating the grid in the GOLIT                     model depends on the concentration of protein expressed, we extracted the concentrations of intimin                     expressed from the LEGIT model and fed them into the GOLIT model.
The initial conditions that need to be set up at the beginning of each game are:
Dimensions of the 2D grid (width and length)
The initial amount of bound cells at zero time point, t=0
The initial amount of unbound cells at zero time point, t=0
The number of generations, i.e. the number of times the grid will be updated
The duration of each generation

Results
We ran the GOLIT model for light intensities 0W/cm2, 18W/cm2, 35W/cm2,                     53W/cm2, and 70W/cm2, i.e. the same values tested in the intimin expression model (LEGIT).                     For each light intensity tested, we plotted the number of cells vs. time points in order to determine the maximum amount                     of adhesion that was accomplished/feasible for each condition evaluated.
Setting up the conditions for the game:
Dimensions of the 2D grid: 50x50 matrix
Evaluate the adhesion of cells for 15 generations
Initially at time, t=0, no cells are in the "bound" state
Black cells represent "bound" cells and white cells are "unbound" cells
Figure 2: For light intensity 0 W/cm2, the plot shows the number of bound cells achieved over our pre-defined time-frame, 15 generations. The grid visually represents the amount of bound cells after 15 generations
Figure 3: For light intensity 18 W/cm2, the plot shows the number of bound cells achieved over our pre-defined time-frame, 15 generations. The grid visually represents the amount of bound cells after 15 generations
Figure 4: For light intensity 35 W/cm2, the plot shows the number of bound cells achieved over our pre-defined time-frame, 15 generations. The grid visually represents the amount of bound cells after 15 generations
Figure 5: For light intensity 53 W/cm2, the plot shows the number of bound cells achieved over our pre-defined time-frame, 15 generations. The grid visually represents the amount of bound cells after 15 generations
Figure 6: For light intensity 70 W/cm2, the plot shows the number of bound cells achieved over our pre-defined time-frame, 15 generations. The grid visually represents the amount of bound cells after 15 generations
Note that the GOLIT model is based on probabilities and that exact values will change                     every time the model is run. We are only interested in the general trends rather than precise numbers.

Figure 7: Demonstrates a summary of the efficiency of binding for each light intensity tested
Given that the dimensions of the grid were 50 columns x 50 rows, we know that the maximum number of "bound" cells that can exist on the grid is 2500.                     The ultimate aim of the GOLIT model is to obtain a black grid, i.e. 100% bound cells. To start off                     we ran the model for 15 generations and compared the performance of each light intensity tested.                     From the LEGIT model we know that 18W/cm2 gives the highest production of surface protein. We observe                     a similar result when running the GOLIT model, since 18W/cm2 gives the highest number of bound cells after                     15 generations.
When we ran the model for 15 generations, focus was not put on filling up the                     grid but rather on comparing the rates at which the grids fill up, i.e. rates at which the cells aggregate.                     Now, given that 18W/cm2 represents the most efficient conditions to for bacterial cell adhesion,                     we wanted to test the number of generations that are required to fill up the grid.
Figure 8: shows the number of aggregated cells after 80 generations for 18W/cm2, which we identified as the light intensity giving the highest rate of cell aggregation
Making the Model smart: incorporating Artificial Intelligence
Aim: Optimize the initial light distribution pattern on the grid to allow for the                     fastest rate of cell aggregation.
We decided to upgrade our model by incorporating Artificial Intelligence, more particularly a                     Genetic Algorithm (GA) . Genetic Algorithms are a type of subsymbolic artificial agent. Essentially, they adopt the                     principles of Darwinian evolution to tackle the challenge of parameter optimization.
In the context of GOLIT we are applying a Genetic Algorithm to optimize the positions at which light should be shown onto an empty grid,                     i.e. the grid at time t=0. In other words, this means that we are using Artificial Intelligence                     to generate the initial pattern of “bound” cells on the grid that will allow for the fastest rate of cell                     adhesion. The only input arguments given are the maximum number of cells to be placed on the initial                     grid. The model then runs a number of “agents” that generate different patterns according to random                     probabilities. The Genetic Algorithm selects the “best agent”, i.e. the “agent” showing the pattern                     that will allow cells to aggregate fastest and therefore allow for the most efficient cell aggregation.

How does it work?

Results
As described above the Genetic Algorithm is an automated way of optimizing the                     conditions of the grid. In our case the dependent variable that we want to optimize is the time it takes                     to fill up the grid, i.e. optimize the model such that the lowest possible number of generations is needed to                         fill up the grid. The independent                         variable that affects time is the initial light pattern shown onto our empty grid.
Once the Genetic Algorithm has selected the "best agent", it provides two main results: the probabilities                     we should set for the rules of the game and the number of generations that will be needed to fill up the grid with those probabilities.
When running the model in Python, the Genetic Algorithm prints these results:
Finding Cover time: this indicates the number of generations it will                             take for the grid to fill up, assuming the probabilities given by the best agent are used
Finding best agent: the 5 probabilities listed correspond to the "optimal"                         rules one would need to follow when shining light on the grid in order to allow the cells to aggregate at the fastest rate
Feeding the Model with Experimental Data
The ultimate goal of developing mathematical models is to create robust systems                     which are representative of reality. The best way to optimize parameters in a model is to use experimental data.                      Our Wet Lab team simulated the bacterial chemical adhesion between SpyTag and SpyCatcher, by testing the adhesion                     between Biotin and Avadin. Similar to SpyTag and SpyCatcher, Biotin and Avadin form a covalent bond when in close proximity to each other.                     This experimental data allowed us to determine the optimum concentration of surface proteins needed to achieve binding                     at the fastest rate.
The video above shows 8 eppendorf tubes, each representing the                 different experimental conditions tested. We performed a series of experiments with competent cells.                     From left to right: DMF solvent and Avadin, DMF solvent and PBS solvent,                 PBS solvent and Avadin, PBS solvent, 125 µMBiothin and Avadin, 125 µM Biotin and PBS, 1000µM Biotin and Avadin,                 1000µM Biotin and PBS.
Figure 10: Shows the number of aggregated cells vs. time. These are the                     experimental results obtained for the simulation of SpyTag/SpyCatcher adhesion using Biotin and Avadin
From our experimental data we determined that as time passed a greater number of cells adhered to each other.                     Therefore, as time passed a greater number of cells aggregated to each other, and sedimented to the bottom                     of the eppendorf tubes, a lower concentration of un-adhered cells remained in the supernatant stream. To implement this data in the GOLIT,                     we calculated the percentage change in aggregation between each time point. This percentage change represented the probability of a cell adhering with another cell at each time point.                     We decided to run the Game of LIT once we combined these experimentally determined probabilities with the binding probabilities that were dependent on the number                     of neighbouring cells.
The grid, as expected, does not fill up at the end our experiment. This occurs because from the final OD measurement of the supernatant stream in the eppendorf tubes it was                 evident that un-adhered cells were still present in the supernatant stream. We would expect all the cells to adhere to each other if we allowed for a sufficiently long period of time.
We would like to conduct future experiments to determine the optimum concentrations of Avidin and Biotin required to                     lead to all the cells present in a culture to adhere to themselves in the least amount of time.
