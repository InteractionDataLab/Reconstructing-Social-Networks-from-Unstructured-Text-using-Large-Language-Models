pCMMCD 105
Plasmid consisting of ComR (BBa_K2341000), the p1655 promoter (containing the ComR box, BBa_K2341001), GusA and an erythromycin resistance.
GusA encodes the beta-glucuronidase gene from E. coli. This is a popular reporter gene that uses glucuronides as substrates, the most common of which are X-gluc (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide) and para-nitrophenyl glucuronide.
Here, it is under the control of the ComRS pathway and uses the ComS peptide from S. thermophilius (LPYFAGGL).

piFinal (BBa_K577882)
iGEM plasmid consisting of araC, a pBAD/AraC promoter (I0500), an RBS (B0034), an RFP (E1010), and two terminators (B0010 and B0012) contained inside one biobrick (B0015)
