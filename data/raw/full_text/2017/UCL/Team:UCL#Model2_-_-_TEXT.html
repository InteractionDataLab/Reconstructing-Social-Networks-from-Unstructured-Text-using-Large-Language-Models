The Science behind the LIT bulb
We developed our OptoFlux model to determine the optimum shape for our LIT bulb.                     The LIT bulb is powered by the co-culture of photosynthesizing Cyanobacteria cells and luminescing E.coli cells.                     In order to maximize the amount of luminescence our E.coli cells can produce we need to maximize the amount of photosynthesis                     taking place by the Cyanobacteria cells.
Essentially, when the Cyanobacteria cells photosynthesize they produce glucose. A portion of the glucose they                     produce is then taken up by the E.coli cells to produce luminescence. OptoFlux works by ensuring the rate of photosynthesis is the same                     in all the cells regardless of their position in the LIT bulb, hence it assumes that the same light intensity will reach all the cells.                     We are modelling the optimal dimensions (diameter of the LIT bulb) that minimize the shading effects within the bulb.                     Finally, we used the optimal dimensions obtained from OptoFlux to create a 3D model of our LIT bulb in Autodesk Fusion 360.

Outlining the steps for the LIT bulb design
Step 1: Use OptoFlux to determine the optimal LIT bulb diameter that maximizes the amount of glucose produced
Step 2: Determine the number of E.coli cells required to produce a high enough luminescence which can compete with a conventional 160W light bulb
Step 3: Evaluate if the amount of glucose produced from the Cyanobacteria cells is sufficient to culture the required number of E.coli cells
Step 1: Use OptoFlux to determine the optimal LIT bulb diameter that maximizes the amount of glucose produced
Modelling step outline
1) Determine the Incoming Photon Flux Density (Iph) at the edge of the LIT bulb that is closest to the light source
2) Determine the Iph at each position in the LIT bulb
3) Determine the rate of photon uptake by the  Cyanobacteria cells at each position in the LIT bulb
4) Determine the average sugar production rate at each position in the LIT bulb
Modelling steps
1) Determine the Incoming Photon Flux Density (Iph) at the edge of the LIT bulb that is closest to the light source
Figure 2: Demonstrates light being shown onto the bacterial co-culture in the LIT bulb
We determined the number of photons entering our LIT bulb by employing the Planck-Einstein relationship . This                     relationship enabled us to use radiometric units to quantify the number of photons entering our LIT bulb. We only focused on quantifying the photons within the Photosynthetically                     Active Radiation (PAR) part of the light spectrum, as those are the only light wavelengths used for photosynthesis.                     Through quantifying the number of photons entering our LIT bulb we could determine the levels of photosynthesis                     that could take place by our Cyanobacteria cells.
Where:
Iphλ = Incoming photon flux density at a particular wavelength (λ)
Iph = Total Incoming photon flux density over the PAR light spectrum
Enl = Amount of light absorbed by the Cyanobacteria cells at different Iph values
2) Determine the Iph at each position in the LIT bulb
Figure 3: Demonstrates that different amounts of light reach different positions in the LIT bulb
We then decided to divide the LIT bulb into a number of imaginary segments (z),                 and to determine the Iph entering each of the imaginary segments of the LIT bulb. This way, we could evaluate the number of photons                 available for the photosynthesis of our Cyanobacteria cells at each position within the bulb.
Where:
αx,λ = Specific light absorption coefficient for Cyanobacteria cells
Cx = Concentration of Cyanobacteria biomass in the LIT bulb
z = Zone, i.e. Location in the LIT bulb
AF = Accumulation Factor (accounts for the photoaccumulation state of the cells)
Δλ = Wavelength intervals
3) Determine the rate of photon uptake by the  Cyanobacteria cells at each position in the LIT bulb
Figure 4: Demonstrates photons entering the LIT bulb
We determined the photon uptake rate at each position in the LIT bulb using forward and backward                     finite differences. The finite differences allowed us to estimate an approximation.
Where:
Δz = Distance between two positions in the LIT bulb
qph(z) = Rate of photon uptake by the Cyanobacteria cells at each position in the LIT bulb
4) Determine the average sugar production rate at each position in the LIT bulb
Figure 5: Demonstrates photosynthesis and respiration taking place by the co-cultured bacteria in the LIT bulb
We determined the average rate of sugar production within the LIT bulb  by determining                     the specific rate of sugar production and the yield of biomass on sugar at each position in the bulb.
Part 1: Finding the specific rate of sugar production at each position of the LIT bulb:
Where:
qsc(z)= Specific sugar production rate at each position in the LIT bulb
qs,mc(z) = Maximal sugar production rate in the cells
Yphmc = Maximal yield of sugar on photons
Part 2: Determine the yield of biomass on sugar production at each position of the LIT bulb
Where:
Ysph(z)= Yield of biomass on sugar at every position in the LIT bulb
Where:
qs averagec= Average sugar production rate
OptoFlux Results
With our OptoFlux model, we were able to determine the optimal: LIT bulb dimensions, Cyanobacteria cell concentration and Incoming Photon Flux Density
Optimal LIT bulb dimensions
When optimizing the diameter for the LIT bulb we decided to focus on two aspects,                 the amount of sugar produced and the yield of sugar on biomass for each diameter tested.

Figure 7: Demonstrates the effect increasing the diameter of the bulb has on the average sugar production rate and the                 yield of biomass on sugar
As expected, Figure 7 shows the general trend of increase in LIT bulb diameter with a decrease in average sugar production rate.                 Increasing the diameter of the bulb, increases the area available for the Cyanobacteria cells, which again increases the probability of shading                 effects associated with the distribution of the cells along the diameter of the bulb.                 The higher the shading effect, the lower the amount of light that can reach all the cells in the cell culture.                 The point of intersection of the 2 lines represents the trade off of the 2 optimized conditions.

Optimizing the concentration of the Cyanobacteria cells in the LIT bulb
Similarly, to optimize the concentration of Cyanobacteria cells needed for the LIT bulb we focused on two aspects:                 the amount of sugar produced; and the yield of sugar on biomass for each diameter tested.

Figure 10: Demonstrates the effect changing the Cyanobacteria concentration has on the average sugar production rate and the                 yield of biomass on sugar
Figure 10 demonstrates that increasing the concentration of Cyanobacteria in the LIT bulb, decreases the                 average rate of sugar production. An augmentation in the concentration of cells in the bulb, leads to an increase in the overall number of cells.                 This causes the content of the LIT bulb to be more viscous.                 Therefore, it becomes harder for light to penetrate the cell culture and reach cells that are found further inside the bulb.                 As such, the average sugar production rate in the LIT bulb decreases. The yield of biomass on sugar increases as the concentration of                 Cyanobacteria cells increases. This occurs because, if the number of cells in the bulb increases there are a larger number of                 cells photosynthesizing. This in turn results in a larger amount of sugar being produced. Here again the intersection of the two lines                 represents the optimized conditions, i.e. the trade off between average sugar concentration and yield of biomass on sugar.

Figure 12: Outlines the parameters that were inputted into OptoFlux model to optimize the Iph for the LIT bulb
Figure 13: Demonstrates the effect increasing the Iph has on the average sugar production rate and the                 yield of biomass on sugar
From Figure 13 we see that an increase in the Iph for the LIT bulb correlates with an increase in the average sugar production rate. This occurs                 because increasing the Iph for the bulb, essentially corresponds to an increase in the number of photons entering the bulb. Therefore, a larger number of photons is available for photosynthesis.                 This photon increase helps overcome any shading effects present in the LIT bulb and allows for more cells to photosynthesize.                 However, as the Iph increases the yield of biomass per photon decreases. This occurs because once the saturation point for photosynthesis is met, the maximum rate for photosynthesis is met, and the remaining                 photons will not be utilized by the cells for photosynthesis. The best Iph was identified as the point at which the graphs intersect. Although                 past the point of intersection the average sugar production rate increases there is such a significant decrease in the yield of sugar per photon the best trade-off between the two                 variables is identified as the point of intersection.

Step 2: Determine the number of E.coli cells required to produce a high enough luminescence which can compete with a conventional 160W light bulb
1) Determine the number of E.coli cells required to produce the required luminescence
From literature we determined that each E.coli cell produces a luminescence equivalent to 104 photons/s.                 A 160 W light bulb produces a luminescence of 1018 photons/s. Therefore:
2) Determine the number of Cyanobacteria cells required to produce sufficient levels of glucose                 to co-culture the desired number of E.coli cells
The ratio of E.coli cells to Cyanobacteria cells in a co-culture is; 107 E.coli cells to 108 Cyanobacteria cells. Therefore:
3) Determine the concentration of Cyanobacteria cells required in the bulb and compare it to the                 maximum concentration of Cyanobacteria cells our OptoFlux optimized LIT design can handle
In order to determine the Cyanobacteria cells' concentration in the LIT bulb we first calculated the mass of the Cyanobacteria cells and then determined the moles of the Cyanobacteria cells.                 This enabled us to determine the concentration of Cyanobacteria cells present in the LIT bulb.
The OptoFlux LIT bulb design has the capacity to culture up to 100 mol/m3 of Cyanobacteria cells.                 In order for our LIT bulb to produce a luminescence equivalent to a 160W light bulb we require a Cyanobacteria concentration of 0.15 mol/m3, this                 concentration is 100 fold lower than the maximum Cyanobacteria concentration that can be handled in the OptoFlux LIT bulb design.                 Therefore, our OptoFlux LIT bulb is suitable to maintain our co-culture.
Step 3: 3D Prototype of the LIT bulb
We decided to create a prototype of the OptoFlux LIT bulb on Autodesk Fusion 360.

OptoFlux Assumptions
Light will only hit the bulb from one side
The diameter inputted into the OptoFlux model represents the longest distance light would need travel through the bulb
E.coli cells and Cyanobacteria cells are homogeneously distributed within the LIT bulb
As blue light activates the luminescence of the E.coli cells, the absorption coefficients for Cyanobacteria were taken at 450nm (13 m2mol-1) light wavelength
The effects of light scattering, including reflection and refraction, are neglected
All cells in the cell culture are in their exponential growth phase
