Both cell types have been programmed to symbiotically coexist and produce enough luminescence to light up a street on a nightly basis. Cyanobacteria will be engineered to secrete the glucose product from photosynthesis, thus they would be unable to sustain their growth when competing against other microbes in the environment if they were to be released.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text-section" style="border: none" id="How"><H1 class="title">How the LIT bulb works</H1><P class="text-figure">Figure 1: Components of the LIT bulb designd with Pictochart</P><P class="text-content-new">When sunlight is present the biological switches present in our cells become repressed and luminescence is not produced from our cells. Oppositely, during the evening when light is not present, our biological switches become activated and luminescence is produced. As such, the LIT bulb is fully automated. We used Cyanobacteria cells, which photosynthesise, to produce the nutrients required by the E.coli cells to luminesce; and relied upon the E.coli cells’ respiration to provide the nutrients required for the continued survival of the Cyanobacterial cells.We then created a unique LIT bulb design which allowed for uniform lighting while at the same time maintained the correct conditions needed for the continued survival of the two cell types.</P><H1 class="title">Design considerations</H1><P class="text-content-new">Our original idea was to create genetically engineered cells that would not require any electrical or mechanical input to keep cells suspended in a culture. However, we soon realised we would be facing homogeneity issues due to heat and nutrient transfer if we did not come up with a design that could continuously re-suspend our cells inside our lightbulb. So we invented that too. We created a rotor that gently moves the cell cultures around such that they are always in correct suspension and equilibrium.
                                We also considered the high energy strain of the cells due to luminescence production, temporary/limited food source, robustness/safety/biocontainment, permeability to oxygen (gas exchange) and human perception.</P></DIV></DIV><TABLE class="text-content-new" style="margin-left: 100px !important; max-width:80%!important"><TBODY><TR><TH class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Criteria</TH><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Conventional lightbulbs</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">LED lightbulbs</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Lightbulbs with motion sensors</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Bioluminescent lightbulb</TD></TR><TR><TH class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Scale of project meets the needs to replace the lightbulbs in London</TH><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD></TR><TR><TH class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Environmental impact</TH><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD></TR><TR><TH class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Maintenance costs </TH><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD></TR><TR><TH class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Upfront costs to implement the technology </TH><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">x</TD></TR><TR><TH class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">Power/ light intensity of lightbulbs</TH><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD><TD class="text-content" style="padding: 10px">√</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="text-figure" style="padding-left:100px!important">Figure 2: Summary table of the six major criteria evaluated for all Streetlight technologies </P><DIV class="text-section col-sm-8" style="border: none"><P class="text-content-new" style="padding-left: 100px!important">We developed mathematical models to determine the optimal dimensions of the light bulb as well as the quantities of each microorganism required to provide the maximum amount of luminescence possible (160W). The circular structure of the LIT bulb maximizes the exposure of Cyanobacteria to sunlight. We introduced a pump to ensure the cells remain suspended and the cell culture is homogeneously distributed throughout the LIT bulb. We also added a three-way manual valve to allow for the easy replacement of media once every 12 months. We will add a filter to the valve to allow media to be replaced without removing the cell culture. To validate the robustness of our product we would conduct a series of experiments to optimise the shape and components of the LIT bulb using the data we have obtained from our OptoFlux design model. The LIT bulb has been designed such that it fits inside the conventional streetlamps in London.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><UL style="white-space: nowrap"><LI style="list-style: none; display: inline; margin-left:-400px!important">Figure 3: 3D prototype designed in Autodesk Fusion 360.</LI></UL></DIV><DIV id="manufacture" class="text-section" style="border: none"><H1 class="title" style="padding-left: 100px!important">Manufacturing Practices</H1><DIV style="padding-left: 0px!important; margin-left:0!important; padding-right: 120px!important"><P class="text-content-new">Lighting alone consumes 19% of global electricity and electricity is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emission, accounting for 25% of global carbon emissions.

We plan to engineer E. coli cells to bioluminesce only at night time to minimise the energy strain of bioluminescence production, and to engineer cyanobacteria to perform their natural photosynthesis but secrete the glucose product to feed the E. coli cells for their long-term survival. The oxygenic photosynthesis by the Cyanobacteria will simultaneously reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Our aim is to create organisms that can only reproduce and survive under artificial conditions. To do this, we envision running our own experiments which will be aimed at evaluating which bacterial strains grow solely in the presence of very low levels of specific gases, namely Oxygen gas. We would also test our LIT bulb under extreme environmental conditions to ensure that luminescence would be produced by our bacteria under the harshest of environments.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text-section col-sm-10" style="border:none"><DIV class="text-section" style="border: none"><H1 class="title">The future of the LIT bulbs </H1><DIV class="row" style="border: none; max-width: 100%!important"><P class="text-content-new">We decided to envision the implementation of our product, the LIT bulb, using a “think global, act local” approach.

Yet, whenever a new product is introduced to the market, the regulations in place have to be considered.

In case a LIT bulb broke (e.g. from a car accident) and the genetically engineered bacteria were released into the environment, the cells would die immediately and as such verify that they would not pose a threat of bio-contaminant .</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="text-section col-sm-10" style="border:none"><DIV class="text-section" style="border: none"><H1 class="title">Bibliography</H1>

                    In the UK in 2005, there were 8.12 million lighting points on the country’s streets using approximately 3.14 TWH of electricity, which gave rise to CO2 emissions of 1.32 megatons

                    In the UK (2005) alone, street lighting was using approx. 3.14 TWH of electricity giving rise to CO2 emissions of 1.32 megatons

                    almost half of our carbon footprint is due to electricity and 17% is due to lighting alone.

                    -Efficient Lighting Can Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Provide Electricity for People Who Do Not Have It

                    Furthermore, without further energy-efficiency policy measures, lighting-related annual CO2 emissions will rise to almost 3 gigatonnes by 2030. (https://www.iea.org/textbase/npsum/lll.pdf)

                    The energy consumed to supply lighting entails greenhouse gas emissions of an equally impressive scale: 1 900 Mt of CO2 per year, equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the world’s light passenger vehicles
