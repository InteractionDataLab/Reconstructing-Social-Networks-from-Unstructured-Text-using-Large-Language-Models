This event aims to answer questions such as &quot;What is DNA?&quot;, &quot;What is Gene Recombination?&quot; and so on and deepen understanding of DNA and gene recombination. We conducted a poster session, an easy experiment &quot;Detection of DNA extraction from banana&quot; and crafting, &quot;crafting DNA key holder&quot;.</P><H3>Experiment</H3><P>Participants can see the DNA with their own eyes and feel more familiar to it. </P><H4>Protocol</H4><OL><LI>Crush one third of a banana with a spoon; to break its cell wall.</LI><LI>Mix well 10% saltine water 30 mL and detergent 2.5 mL; Saltine water makes nucleic acid and salt. Detergent breaks cell membrane.</LI><LI>Pour 1 and 2 into a beaker through coffee filter and filtrate them.</LI><LI>After about 5 minutes, slowly pour 40mL of 100% ethanol into the beaker.</LI><LI>Then you’ll see some white lumps. That’s exactly the DNA!!</LI></OL><H3>Crafting</H3><P>Participants craft a DNA key holder and learn the structure of DNA. They can take their work home.</P><P>After the activities, we took a survey and got 93 answers.
We changed some questions from the middle of the festival.</P><DIV class="graphbox"><P class="caption">SEX</P></DIV><DIV class="graphbox"><P class="caption">AGE</P></DIV><DIV class="graphbox"><P class="caption">STUDENT</P></DIV><DIV class="graphbox"><P class="caption">What does 'bio' mean?

The lecture explained the relationship between DNA and proteins, introduced major methods for genetic modification, and application to food or human disease cure.
We tried to talk about Genetic Modification neutrally, not forcing them to love gene modifying. As a result, they correctly understood what gene modifying is, and everyone re-estimated both the value and the risk of it. 
In short, we succeeded in making them think about gene modification, which is filling our lives, with scientific information and value.
