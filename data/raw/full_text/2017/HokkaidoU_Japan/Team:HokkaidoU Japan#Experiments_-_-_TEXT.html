Experiments
In addition to standard experiments as protocols below show, we conducted SDS-PAGE to find that we could make correct proteins about BBa_K2414002 and BBa_K2414003, and analyzed activity of Phytase ,which are existing parts BBa_K912000, BBa_K912001, and new parts BBa_K2414002, and BBa_K2414003. See Results .
We analyzed all the Phytases with this protocol below:
Protocol: 50μl 7.5 mM Phytic acid 190μl CH3COOH Buffer
Digest phytic acid in above situation with sample phytase solution 10μl, 37degrees celcius, 10 min.
After digestion, using AMM solution (2ml of 10mM NH4Mo7O2.4H2O: 5N H2SO4: Acetone= 1:1:2) analyze Optical Absorbance. The more Pi are there, the more yellow AMM becomes.
