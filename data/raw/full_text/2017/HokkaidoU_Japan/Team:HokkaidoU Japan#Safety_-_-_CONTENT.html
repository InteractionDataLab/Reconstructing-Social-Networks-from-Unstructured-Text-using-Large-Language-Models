    Risk Group 1

</SPAN><H1>Description of the biological materials we are using in the lab</H1><H3>Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab</H3>
   
    Some materials possess risks to team members. For example, Ethidium Bromide is an intercalating agent so it must be used by with personal safety gear. All lab staffs were trained according to safety manual provided by Hokkaido University, to prevent risks.
    We took on ourselves to compile a shortlist of often used dangerous materials and safety procedures in our project.

      This is a safe strain. As a precaution all materials coming in contact are sterilized before and after.

    All chemical compounds were used according to their manuals and respective material safety data sheets.


<H1>Genetic material</H1>


      All genes used in this project come from non-pathogenic bacterial strains of <SPAN class="italic">E. coli</SPAN>.
      Expressed proteins did not show any toxic effect to their host.
      Our biobricks do not have any foreseeable selective advantage if released to the environment.
      After consideration we could not find any usage pausing a security concern.

  <H3>Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident</H3>
   

      Some materials pose risks to the general public.
      For example, Ethanol is a flammable solution so it must not be used by open fire.
      Not to release those materials, all lab staff is trained according to safety manual provided by Hokkaido University.

  <H3>Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident</H3>



      The <SPAN class="italic">E. coli</SPAN> strains we use in our lab, are saved in our lab.
      As a precaution all materials coming in contact are sterilized before and after.
   Reference Federal Register, (1986) Vol. V1: 88, 6952-16985.
   

  <H3>Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries</H3>
 

  
      There is no foreseeable risk in misuse of our generated genetic material.
      Our generated genetic material performs basic functions in biology.
      However, it is impossible to guard against the incorporation of our parts in malicious settings.


  <H3>Risks which might arise when our project move from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product</H3>
   



      Our project is about optimizing the expression of genes. Our device does not contain a coding site.
      Therefore, risk will arise when other users assemble our parts with dangerous coding sites.
      We have to caution the users when assembling with dangerous coding sites.

   

<H1>Design features to address safety risks</H1>
 

 
      Our device only contains sequences that regulate the expression of genes
      (Promoter, RBS, and terminator). Therefore, our device in itself does not contain any safety risks and does not have design feature to address safety risks.


<H1>Safety training we received</H1>

      8 members of our team received a lecture class regarding gene recombination that was held in Hokkaido University, and shared the information with the whole team.
      It is based on 'Act on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms'.

      We have a permission to engage in the experiments from the safety officer of genetic recombination of Hokkaido University.
      All members participating in the experiments are registered with this office.
      All members are trained according to the safety demands of safety officer of genetic recombination.


  <H3>Our country's national biosafety regulations and guidelines</H3>
   


      Japan is participating in cartagena act.


  <H3>Biosafety Level rating of our lab</H3>
   



      Our lab's Bio safety level is 2.
