Please see the results in parts regigsry page in Parts page.</P><P>Until the Wiki freeze, we tried to construct plasmid with the insert we designed and managed to combine plasmid with INSERT 1, 2 or 3(we couldn't insert INSERT 4, which is a control of the INSERT 2 or 3).</P><P>To assay our construct, we cultured E. coli with IPTG induction, purified the crude extract by the His-tag and condensed them.</P><P>When the expressed protein (both INSERT 2 and 3) were cut at the signal peptides, the molecular weight becomes 52367.76 or 48575.69 respectively.</P><P>The figure bellow is the result of SDS-PAGE. We applied purified INSERT 2 (left) and INSERT 3 (right, not visible)and found that the band of INSERT 2 is at the correct place.</P><P>We assumed two possibility that explain why we couldn't get the band of INSERT 3; the concentration of protein is too small, the His-tag didn't interacted with the Nickel column and flowed  through.</P><P>To determine the reason why we couldn't see the band, we conducted phytase activity assay with the crude extract, purified and condensed products, and the flow through of purification process.</P><P>As the table and figure below shows, we can see high phytase activity in the flow through and concluded that His-tag didn't interacted with the Nickel, probably because the His-tag was not exposed outside. Simultaneously, we can assume that self-Assembling Peptides (SAPs) helped His-tag being exposed and interacting with Nickel.</P><P>We applied crude extract of INSERT 2 (left) and INSERT 3. (right). The difference of mobility between INSERT 2 and 3 is very small but may be slightly different. (Difficult to judge)</P><H5>Phytase thermostability</H5><UL><P> We assayed thermostability of several kind of phytase; Citrobacter braakii and E. coli phytase from Northwestern 2012 and Klebsiella pneumoniae (our original)</P><P>Though the degree of deactivation is different according to kind of phytase, the characteristic that remaining activity after 1 hour heat shock drops is common.</P><P>From the comparison between INSERT 2 and 3, we can see that activity of phytase from insert 3 drops more drastically than that of from INSERT 2, suggesting that SAPs will improve thermostability of phytase.</P></UL><H5> Project Achievements </H5><UL><P>Successes</P><LI>We confirmed the deactivation of phytase due to heat shock.</LI><LI>We found the improvement of thermostability by SAPs.</LI><LI>Exposure of the His-tag due to SAPs is suggested.</LI><P>Failures</P><LI>We couldn't construct the control part (expression of phytase only) and couldn't assay the function of cysteine module.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
