Summary
Engaging with the Community
The iGEM York 2017 team has engaged with both our local community through outreach activities and beyond, by collaborating with teams from other countries. An example of our outreach activities is our visit to a local primary school, Lord Deramore's Primary School to provide some insight into how scientists look at the world.
For more information on this and our other outreach, please see our Human Practices Silver page.
As well as this, we integrated some of the feedback we received into our project. For example, we spoke with Dr. Richard Kasprowicz of Phasefocus . He advised us that we should apply flat-field filtering to the images in our hologram construction to smooth the brightness - this has since been incorporated.
For more information on our integrated human practices, please see our Integrated Human Practices Gold page.
