Team:York/Acknowledgements
Acknowledgements
We have received advice and guidance throughout the competition, from a number of people. Without their support, our project would not have been possible. We would particularly like to thank the following people:
University of York
Our supervisors, Dr Luke Mackinder and Professor Maggie Smith, who were invaluable to our project. They dedicated a significant amount of their time to help us, offering their expertise and experience in synthetic biology. They guided us on the feasibility of our project, contributed ideas, helped us to obtain all the materials we needed and supported us in obtaining sponsorships. They also gave input and feedback on our presentation.
Our advisors, Sophie Rugg, Ivan Gyulev, Gavin Thomas, Lawrence Wilson and Martin Bees , who provided much needed advice on various protocols.
The Teaching Lab staff, Dr Jen Dyson and Nikki Begg, for providing the space, equipment and technical guidance for our lab work.
Dr Adrian Harrrison, for his help and allocation of financial support with the Outreach aspect of our project. He involved us with the University of York Outreach event with Fulford School.
