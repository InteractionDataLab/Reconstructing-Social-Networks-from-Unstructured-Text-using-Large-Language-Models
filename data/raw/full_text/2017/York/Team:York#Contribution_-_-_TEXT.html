BioBrick Related Contribution
Our Results
Growth rate, motility and structure/shape can all be influenced by BioBricks. While our motility tests were not completely successful, we have at least shown that organisms' sizes can be analysed and that the number of cells in a sample can be found.
Our Contribution
Since we have shown that our hardware and software can be used to observe the aforementioned quantities, our BioBrick-related contribution is the DIHM design and holography software that we have outlined throughout this wiki.
Using these in conjunction allows for quick and straightforward analysis of changes to shape, structure or cell count (and by extension, growth rate). Further, it is possible and, we believe, probable that the motility of cells could be analysed with the same equipment and minimal changes. This presents itself as a promising future application of the same contribution.
