The QWACC team would like to extend our most sincere thanks to our supervisors, advisors and all those whose input has made this project possible.
It has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience, made much easier through all your kind guidance.
Special Thanks to:
Prof. Maggie Smith Dept. of Biology, University of York
For being our primary PI and helping to design the project from the beginning.
Dr. Luke Mackinder Dept. of Biology, University of York
For having such patience while acting as our secondary PI, for his consistent input and support with problem-solving during the project and for allowing us to use his lab.
Dr. Laurence Wilson Dept. of Physics, University of York
For his advice on our choice of optical components and the writing of the holography code, without which, the QWACC would have been a non-starter.
Dr. Steven Johnson Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University of York
For providing support with electronics throughout the design process.
Prof. Martin Bees Dept. of Mathematics, University of York
For providing insight into potential models for co-culture growth.
Sophie Rugg Dept. of Biology, University of York
For her support and outstanding tolerance in the face of our undying ineptitude.
Ivan Gyulev Dept. of Biology, University of York
For his help and patience with our countless questions.
Andy White Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University of York
For always providing brilliant help and ideas during the hardware design and construction process.
Mark Bentley (and Tom Price) Mechanical Workshop, Dept. of Biology, University of York
For manufacturing so many perfect hardware components.
Nicki Begg Dept. of Biology, University of York
For her patience while helping us to use lab equipment safely.
Thanks Also to:
The Aachen 2017 Team RWTH Aachen University
For their provision of organisms during the testing of our DIHM.
The Darmstadt 2017 Team TU Darmstadt
For their kind provision of a spare laser.
Alexander Allenby, Apple Chew and Jo Thomas Various Departments, University of York
For their contributions towards the start of the project.
Dr. Richard Kasprowicz of Phasefocus
For his feedback regarding pseudo-flat field correction and provision of organisms during the testing of our DIHM.
Rachael Evans Dept. of Biology, University of Sheffield
For her input regarding metabolic rate analysis.
James Robson Dept. of Biology, University of York
For his provision of a peristaltic pump during the hardware testing phase.
Dr. Daniel Jeffares Dept. of Biology, University of York
For his provision of organisms during the testing of our DIHM.
Dr. Thierry Tonon Dept. of Biology, University of York
For his provision of organisms during the testing of our DIHM.
Rachel Findlay Dept. of Physics, University of York
For her assistance with writing code.
Dr. William Smith Dept. of Computer Science, University of York
For his advice concerning blob-detection.
Dr. Mike Freeman Dept. of Computer Science, University of York
For his advice concerning Fourier Transforms.
