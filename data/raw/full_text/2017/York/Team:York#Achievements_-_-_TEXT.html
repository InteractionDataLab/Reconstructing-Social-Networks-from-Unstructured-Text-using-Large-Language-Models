Medal Criteria
Below is a list of links to the pages we have made which show that we have met various Medal criteria.
Bronze criterion #3: Covered by our Attributions page.
Bronze criterion #4: Covered on the Contribution page.
Silver criterion #1: See the Software and Downloads pages for the validity of our software.
See the Hardware and Results (Cell Counting) sections for proof that our DIHM is capable of producing valid results.
Silver criterion #2: See the Collaborations page.
Silver criterion #3: Seen on the Human Practices Silver page.
Gold criterion #1: Seen on the Integrated Human Practices Gold page.
Gold criterion #4: See the Demonstrate page.
Awards
Below is a list of links to the pages we have made which nominate us for Special Prizes.
Applied Design : We have designed a co-culture analysis system which has several, distinct advantages over the traditional methods.
Innovation in Measurement : We have created hardware and software that can be used in conjunction to measure the effects of Parts* on co-cultures.
Integrated Human Practices : We communicated with the scientific community and incorporated their feedback into our hardware and software.
Software : We have created several programs that create and analyse digital holograms in order to count cells.
* The measurements our hardware/software can be used to perform are not limited to characterising Parts and cannot characterise all Parts - we have confirmed that we can see changes that affect growth rate, shape, size or, with some improvement to the hardware, motility.
ABOUT US
We are an overgraduate team representing the University of York.
Our Quicker Way to Analyse Co-Cultures ( QWACC ) is our entry into the Hardware track for iGEM 2017.
