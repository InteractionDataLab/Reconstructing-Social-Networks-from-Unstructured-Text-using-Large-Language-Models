Team:York/Results/Judging
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register and attend: Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
  ✓
Deliverables: Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page (section 4)
  ✓
Attribution: Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
  ✓
Characterization: Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study and/or improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Validated Part: Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part of your own design that is central to your project works as expected. Document the experimental characterization of this part on the Main Page of that Part’s Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (following Registry submission guidelines). This working part must be different from the part documented in gold #2.
Collaboration: Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.
Human Practices: Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfill this criteria.
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Integrated Human Practices: Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Model your project: Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
