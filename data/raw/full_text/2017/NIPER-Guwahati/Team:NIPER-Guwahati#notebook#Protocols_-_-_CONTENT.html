 UREA PAGE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
We ordered readymade urea page gel and loaded the sample with TBE Urea sample buffer.
Crush and soak method.	
Single or double stranded DNA molecules once separated, were extracted from the urea PAGE gel by crush and soak method. The principle involved was separation of DNA molecules by simple diffusion method. Gel piece of interest was cut down from the gel, dried and the gel was made into fine particles.  3 to 4 volume of the 1mM EDTA +0.5M ammonium acetate solution was added to the dried and fine powdered urea gel and  incubated for a period of 6 to 8 hours at 550  c.After the incubation time    the sample was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes and collected the supernatant that contains DNA.

•	In a 6 well culture plate, add 6μL of oligofectamine and 45μLof optiMEM to each well and pipette it 15 times.
•	Incubate at room temperature for 8 minutes.
5.	Combine DNAzyme mix with oligofectamine mix (15μL/well)
6.	Incubate for 20 min at room temperature.
