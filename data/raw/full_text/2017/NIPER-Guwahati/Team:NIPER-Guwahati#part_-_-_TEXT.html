Basic Parts
Deoxyribozymes are DNA molecules with catalytic activity.The current part is an evolved deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) with the ability to cleave oncogene Bcl-2 mRNA. This DNAzyme has been evolved after 10 rounds of In Vitro selection. The selection was directly been carried out with 60 ntds Bcl-2 mRNA template for evolving RNA cleaving DNAzyme. The DNAzyme evolved with our unique strategy are trans Deoxyribozymes.
