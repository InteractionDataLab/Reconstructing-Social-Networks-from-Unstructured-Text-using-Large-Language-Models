ATTRIBUTIONS
Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology: Sponsored our project under Indian Biological Engineering Competition (iBEC), a pre-iGEM competition which provides financial support to iGEM teams from India on the basis of potential applications of proposed work.
State Bank of India: They also sponsored our project and provided financial support and funding.
NIPER – Guwahati: The initial fund required for registration in iGEM was provided by our institute. We are also grateful to our institute for providing us funding for labs and the research facility.
Guwahati Biotech Park (GBP): GBP provided us labs, instruments and other facilities. All our work was carried out here.
IIT Guwahati: We are grateful to Dr. Ajaikumar B. Kunnumakkara and the PhD students from the Cancer Biology Laboratory, Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT - Guwahati for providing us the lab space and facilities we needed for performing RT – PCR for validation of our work.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT): IDT is the world's largest supplier of custom nucleic acids, serving the areas of academic research, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceutical development. It provided us biotin coated BCl-2 mRNA and the primers we required for PCR.
