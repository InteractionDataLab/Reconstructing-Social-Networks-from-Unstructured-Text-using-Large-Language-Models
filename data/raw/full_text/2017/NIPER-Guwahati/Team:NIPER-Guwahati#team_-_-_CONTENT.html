          Hi there !

We, the IGEM team of NIPER Guwahati are a group of passionate biotechnologists exploring the field of synthetic biology.
As such, we strive hard to bring synthetic biology closer to the world.
And we believe that, under the friendly guidance of our most experienced research associates and with our sincere efforts, we will bring about changes that will raise the bar for research in synthetic biology.
The 21 century is vastly different from previous centuries just because of the leaps and bounds made in research.  We hope that our research will be a building block for great advancements in cancer treatment.
It has been a most challenging and exciting journey as we join forces with others in the battle against cancer.
