Project Description
"In vitro evolution of anti-apoptotic protein inhibitors using split GFP/YFP approach followed by cell-specific cell-permeating peptide guided targeted-delivery for cancer cell elimination"
The studies on Onco-protein-binders and its targeted delivery to the cancer cell has immense scope for its further development as lead Biopharmaceutical molecules.Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions using small organic molecules becomes more challenging as the interfaces become more complex, i.e., as binding epitopes are displayed on primary, secondary, or tertiary structures.In vitro selection of Bcl-2 protein Binder and its further targeted delivery into the Leukemia cell could provide researchers a template to evolve Onco-protein binders and further develop them into lead Biopharmaceutical molecules.
With our project we are trying to boost the global efforts of developing Synthetic Protein biopharmaceuticals as Complete Drug molecules/Bio-pharmaceuticals, which includes a synthetic protein which is able to bind/inhibit the target (Drug Action) and is guided by a Cancer cell specific Cell permeating Peptide (CPP) domain to specifically Deliver the Protein Inhibitor inside the Cancer cells (Targeted Drug Delivery).
Goals
In vitro Evolution of Bcl-2 protein binder using split GFP/YFP approach
Bcl-2 gene assembly in split GFP/YFP vector having N-terminus GFP
Generation of random protein coding library using “in-house” overlap    PCR approach
Cloning of random protein coding sequence library in split GFP/YFP vector having C-terminus GFP
Screening of Bcl-2 binding Protein partners using split-GFP/YFP  approach  in E. coli
Evolution of cell-penetrating cell-specific peptides for Human Leukemia cell line (e.g. K562, HL-60) using Phage surface-display approach.
Validation of targeted inhibition of Bcl-2 function in Leukemia cells
Objectives
The main objective of our iGEM project is to generate "Complete Drug molecules/Bio-pharmaceuticals; which includes a synthetic protein which is able to bind/inhibit the target (Drug Action) and is guided by a Cell permeating Peptide (CPP) domain to Deliver the Protein Inhibitor inside the Cancer cells (Drug Delivery).
