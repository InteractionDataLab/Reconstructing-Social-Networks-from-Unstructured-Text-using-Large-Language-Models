Plate reader
microplate reader FLUOstar Omega emission filter: 520 nm excitation filter: 485 nm
Material
Fluorescein sodium salt 1xPBS Tissue culture testplate (black with flat bottom)
Method
Prepare fluorescein stock solution
1. Spin down fluorescein stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube. 2. Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 μM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of 1xPBS. 3. Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution and resulting concentration of fluorescein   stock solution 50 μM
Serial dilutions
1. Add 100 μl of PBS into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12 2. Add 200 μl of fluorescein 1x stock solution into A1, B1, C1, D1 3. Transfer 100 μl of fluorescein stock solution from A1 into A2. 4. Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A3. 5. Mix A3 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A4. 6. Mix A4 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A5. 7. Mix A5 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A6. 8. Mix A6 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A7. 9. Mix A7 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A8. 10. Mix A8 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A9. 11. Mix A9 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A10. 12. Mix A10 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A11. 13. Mix A11 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into liquid waste.    (Caution: Do not to continue serial dilution into column 12.)

Method
1. Day 1 : Resuspended each plasmid in plate 7 and transform into Escherichia coli DH5α.  (Transformation protocol is from iGEM) 2. Day 2 : Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate it on 5-10 mL LB medium +Chloramphenicol.Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 170 rpm. 3. Day 3 : Set instrument to read OD600 (as OD calibration setting)and measure OD600 of the overnight cultures 4. Dilute the cultures to a target OD 600 of 0.02 in 12 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube (covered with foil to block light). 5. Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 170 rpm. 6. Take 1000 μL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation and place samples on ice 7. 4 replicates of 100 uL samples were taken from each culture at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation and placed in a 96 well plate for OD and fluorescence measurements using the setup described above
