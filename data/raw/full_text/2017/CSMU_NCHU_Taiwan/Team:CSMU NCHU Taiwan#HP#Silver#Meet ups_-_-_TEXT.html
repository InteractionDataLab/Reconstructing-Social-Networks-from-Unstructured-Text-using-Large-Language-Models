-Meet-ups & Conferences-
Our team believes that iGEM isn’t just a competition, but a chance to collaborate and learn from one another, thus we are passionate about every precious chance of meeting with different teams. These are invaluable opportunities to grow together and engage in cooperation.
NYMU-Taipei iGEM team
NYMU-Taipei is the first iGEM team in Taiwan, and their teacher, Prof. Chang, has extensive experience in iGEM competition. We seeked some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. In return, we gave them some information about some professors in National Taiwan Ocean University whose specialty focused on questions similar to their project.
CCU_Taiwan iGEM team
It's our pleasure to have a meet up with CCU iGEM Taiwan on 3rd of July because both of us are joining iGEM for the first time. Thanks to the meetup, we had lots of profound collaborations during this summer.
NCKU_Tainan iGEM team
We had a face-to-face meeting with them in National Cheng Kung University. They interviewed us about their environmental protection project, and we also showed our project to them. With their suggestions, we found a new method to present our project more clearly through the collaboration, where we felt more connected with other iGEMers. We are sincerely thankful for their interview and hospitality.
Missouri Rolla iGEM team
On July 7th, one of the instructors of Missouri Rolla iGEM team, Dave Westenberg, visited us, and we introduced several historic spots in Taichung to him. Being a judge for several years, he informed us about numerous tips about presenting in the Giant Jamboree. To sum up, we had a nice day!
iGEM Taiwan Conference
On July 17th, we took part in Taiwan iGEM Conference, held by CGU iGEM team. It was meaningful to us because we could took this opportunity to get in touch with all iGEM team around Taiwan. In this conference, we shared our progress and our field of research with other team. We were able to understand the pros and cons of our own project from their feedback while seeking for possible collaborations.
iGEM Asia Pacific Conference
We attended the conference held at National Chiao Tung University from July 31th to August 4th. During the four-day event, we had the opportunity to meet around 25 iGEM teams – from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US. In the conference, our team presented our project and received many valuable feedback.
