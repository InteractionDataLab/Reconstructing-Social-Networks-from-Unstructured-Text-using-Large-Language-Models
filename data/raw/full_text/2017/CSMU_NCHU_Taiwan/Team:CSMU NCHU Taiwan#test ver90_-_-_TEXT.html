Successfully partcipated in Human Practices
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
Improve previous part or project：   We improved a T7 promtore with RBS by adding a sequence in it.
We also modified the widely used RFP by removing the barcode after its sequence, and did codon optimization for E.coli as a better part for fusion protein.
Model our project：We did protein structure simulation and molecular docking to assist our fusion protein design. And moleded its expression quantity with time.
Demonstrate: We successfully engineered a fusion protein Thioredoxin-MSMEG5998 that worked better than MSMEG_5998 alone, and proved its degrading ability in room & body temperature.
