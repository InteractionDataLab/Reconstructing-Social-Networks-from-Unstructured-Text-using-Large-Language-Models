Project evolution
Over the past few months, our project evolved because of Human Practice. We visited several specialists, potential customers, legislators and attended to conferences in order to understand the demand for our project, the problems in different aspects and the development of our entrepreneurship. Most importantly, we wish to create safe, affordable and efficient ways to solve the aflatoxin problem. This motivated us to interview people from different fields to seek better ideas. All the feedback we received were thoughtfully reviewed throughout the project design, and propelled our work to a better project.
The top priority of the project has always been to design a safe product, click to see more about the safety consideration implemented with project design and its evolution.
