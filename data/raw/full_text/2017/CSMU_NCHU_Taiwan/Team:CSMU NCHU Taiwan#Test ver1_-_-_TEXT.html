Our project description
For the first part of our project- an aflatoxin detecting strip - our bacteria will be able to produce a fusion protein containing:
1. scFv (Single-chain variable fragment) that can recognize aflatoxin and bind to it Specifically.
2. RFP that make the protein more easy to observe.
3. His Tag acts as the antigen of the secondary antibody.
Using this fusion protein we will create a strip that detects the presence of aflatoxin in food.
For the second part of our project - an aflatoxin degrading enzyme-  our bacteria will be able to produce:
1. An enzyme(FGD) that can degrade aflatoxin.
2. An enzyme that can produce the cofactor(F420H2) of the enzyme(FGD).
Our bacteria will be engineered to release these enzymes (FGD) that can protect the digestive system and human body by degrading the aflatoxin before this harmful substance is absorbed.
