-Theory Of Knowledge-
The aspects related to our project "Aflatoxout" are not just about social interactions. Our team alse regards the competition as a proper research.Therefore, we emphasize on theory of knowledge, the study on "how we know what we claim to know". By discussing with our advisors and experts from different fields frequently and throughly, our team is able to apply the knowledge with greater awareness and credibility.
