Inter Lab
-Public Engagement &Education-
“Aflatoxout” is not only a food safety researching project, but the team would love to, as the phrase stated “go beyond the lab”. We believe the first step in our human practice is “Public engagement and education (PE&E)”. The team reached out to different areas of the society, in hope to spread our concepts and to listen to what the society could inform us about.
