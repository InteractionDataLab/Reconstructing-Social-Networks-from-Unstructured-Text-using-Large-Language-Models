We are thrilled to announce that the Glasgow iGEM 2017 team won this year's prize for the Best Food & Nutrition Project!
All of the hard work that the team put in during the summer paid off as not only did we win the prize for the best project in our track, but we also were nominated for four special prizes which were:
Best Wiki
Best Part Collection
Best Applied Design
Best Measurement
We are ecstatic with what we achieved from what was a fantastic week in Boston and are glad to have been able to meet so many teams from all over the world. We would like to thank all of those who helped throughout the project as our success would not has been possible with it.
