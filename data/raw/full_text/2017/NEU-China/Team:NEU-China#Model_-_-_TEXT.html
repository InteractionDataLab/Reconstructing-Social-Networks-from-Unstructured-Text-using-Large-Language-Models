Basically, the num of luminescence is caused by the spatial structure of the certain protein. However, environmental factors                                                 are inevitable and these factors also influence the total number of luminescence.                                                 We assume the environmental factors' influence can be replaced by the random change                                                 of the sptial structure.
Assume x is the relative position of the sequence, and s(x) is the score of each                                                 position. Including the random factor, we have
Luminescence is a function of s*(x), assume the function is f, so
We use a multi-layer BP neural network to fit funtion g.
We set the number of neuron in the output layer to one, and use Relu function to calculate g(x1,x2, ... ,xn). Relu is defined                                                 as following:
By this network, we succesafully fitted g(x1,x2, ... ,xn). Then we put the sequence of OR1D2 as the input, with the mentioned                                                 network, we can predict the total number of luminescence of OR1D2 in the same( or                                                 similar) environment.
