Questionnaires
We want to see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a random survey online and we also                                         went out onto the street to send out some of the questionnaires and we want to thank                                         Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires in their city.
iSmeller Campus Talk for High School Students
First, we came to the high school campus, we introduced our project to high school students so that they have a preliminary                                         understanding of ismeller. We have also carried out a series of interactions and                                         they have raised a lot of interesting proposals to us. For example, a boy who had                                         a strong interest in ismeller had a strong desire to join us. He made a bold idea                                         which was making an easily-carried "police nose" with iSmeller to replace the police                                         dog.
On the open day of the lab, we also invited high school students and their parents who were interested in synthetic biology                                         to visit our labs.
iSmeller University Campus Publicity
We hope that our human practice can be known by more people in various fields and stimulate their interest in synthetic biology                                         and our projects. Therefore we still showed our projects to various professional                                         students such as software engineering on the university campus.We had a positive                                         communication. It was interesting that a student thought iSmeller could be made into                                         a sensitive biosensor thereby it could be applied to test whether the fruit was fresh,                                         biosensor would simplify our testing process and made the detection process more                                         quickly, the results more intuitive and imageable. We are very grateful to all the                                         students for their recommendations of the professional. This will have a far-reaching                                         impact on our future work.
Layman’s First Biology Class
Then we held an outdoor workshop after the National Holiday near our college activity center. We taught people how to use                                         microscope. Some people who have no biological background saw the tissue sections                                         for the first time of their life.
In addition, we have also organized a biology modeling contest, inviting all students who were interested in biological participation,                                         and made a biological model with their own hands.
Freshman’s Contribution to iSmeller
In addition, during the opening day of our college, we did a presentation to spread the iGEM concepts and iGEM spirits to                                         our freshmen students, and the freshmen actually showed great enthusiasm in being                                         a part of the iGEMers. We also organized them to take part in our project, we taught                                         them how to extract the plasmid and gave them the bacteria liquid of our vector pcDNA3.1+                                         to complete their experiement.
We also communicated with them about iSmeller’s application. We want to know their expectations to the application of iSmeller.                                         After several interesting communiation, we found that it could be used for the detection                                         of cancer odor. It is reported that different cancers could emit different scents,                                         and we envision that iSmeller can detect early cancer by identifying different scents.
Consult Several Medical Experts About Detection of Early Cancer
 Shugang Fan
Medical PhD
He is expert in a variety of benign tumors (liver and kidney hemangioma, uterine fibroids,                                         breast fibroids) active treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, and the treatment                                         by Chinese medicine after the radiotherapy and chemotherapy for some kinds of malignant                                         tumors surgery, especially conditioning tumor pain, vomiting, diarrhea, ascites and                                         other symptoms.
Yan Yu
Deputy Chief Physician, master in medical
She is engaged in obstetrics and gynecology clinical more than 20 years, specializing                                         in all kinds of perinatal medical diagnosis and treatment, uterine laparoscopy and                                         other minimally invasive surgery, including the diagnosis and treatment of uterine                                         fibroids, cervical cancer, pelvic disease and other cervical disease, published more                                         than 10 papers.
Finally, we contacted two experts of hospitals, told them about our project, and received some feedback. Doctor Fan, the                                         attending physician in Fuzhou Guoyi Tang Chinese Medicine Hospital, said that at                                         present, the diagnosis of the tumor through the puncture, biopsy production of pathological                                         sections and other means of the patient itself has some damage, and may even cause                                         the proliferation of tumor cells, aggravate the condition. And our project had application                                         prospects, especially for the detection of diabetes. And Doctor Yu, the deputy Chief                                         Physician in Chinese People 's Liberation Army 476th Hospital, said that it could                                         be considered to ask the patient to blow to detect whether the exhaled VOC contained                                         the associated disease odor, or to detect urine odor, but the interference was large.
Inspiration to our project:
• As the incipient disease emits very feeble VOCs, we designed the crispra-mediated                                         olfactory signal amplification pathway and successfully enhanced the sensitivity                                         of our biosensor to odor identification.
• For some interferential smell caused by the fungi, because our olfactory receptor                                         can only be combined with its specific odor, no matter what interferential odor exist,                                         our ismeller can specifically identify the corresponding odor.
• Because some tumor cells emit a variety of mixed odors, we intend to introduce                                         multiple olfactory receptors into one cell to achieve specific detection of multiple                                         odor to enhance the accuracy of cancer detection.
Writing iSmeller Handbook
Through the whole social practice, we found that our iSmeller got enthusiastic attention.We also got a lot of meaningful                                         suggestions. We realized that iSmeller would have a lot of potential applications,                                         these inspiration came from our human practice, during which we shared iSmeller with                                         different people, and we also won a lot of valuable information, which would help                                         iSmeller have a further improvement. To this end, we have this part of the valuable                                         content of finishing into a manual to make more people understand the smell detection                                         of new technologies.
