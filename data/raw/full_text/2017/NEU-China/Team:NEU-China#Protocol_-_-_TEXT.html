Protocol:
Target Guide Sequence Cloning protocol
In order to clone the target sequence into the lentiCRISPRv2 or lentiGuide-Puro backbone, synthesize two oligos of the following                                                 form.
Lentiviral vector digestion, oligo annealing and cloning into digested vector:
1. Digest and dephosphorylate 5ug of the lentiviral CRISPR plasmid with BsmBI for                                                     30 min at 37C:
5 ug lentiCRISPRv2 or lentiGuide-Puro
3 ul FastDigest BsmBI (Fermentas)
3 ul FastAP (Fermentas)
6 ul 10X FastDigest Buffer
0.6 ul 100 mM DTT (freshly prepared)
X ul ddH2O
60 ul total
2. Gel purify digested plasmid using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and elute in EB.
If BsmBI digested, a ~2kb filler piece should be present on the gel. Only gel purify                                                 the larger band. Leave the 2kb band.
3. Phosphorylate and anneal each pair of oligos:
1 ul Oligo 1 (100 μM)
1 ul Oligo 2 (100 μM)
1 ul 10X T4 Ligation Buffer (NEB)
6.5 ul ddH2O
0.5 ul T4 PNK (NEB M0201S)
10 ul total
Use the T4 Ligation Buffer since the buffer supplied with the T4 PNK enzyme does                                                 not include ATP (or supplement to 1mM ATP).
Put the phosphorylation/annealing reaction in a thermoccler using the following                                                 parameters:
37℃ 30 min →95℃ 5 min and then ramp down to 25℃ at 5℃/min
4. Dilute annealed oligos from Step 3 at a 1:200 dilution into sterile water or EB.
5. Set up ligation reaction and incubate at room temperature for 10 min:
X ul BsmBI digested plasmid from Step 2 (50ng)
1 ul diluted oligo duplex from Step 4
5 ul 2X Quick Ligase Buffer (NEB)
X ul ddH2O
10 ul subtotal
1 ul Quick Ligase (NEB M2200S)
11 ul total
Also perform a negative control ligation (vector-only with water in place of oligos)                                                 and transformation.
6. Transformation into DH5α bacteria.
Extract human genome DNA:
1. Cultured Cell Preparation
a. Harvest cells
• Attached cell cultures: Release cells with trypsin. Pellet up to 5 × 106 cells                                                 for 5 minutes at 300 × g; remove the culture medium completely and discard. Continue                                                 to step 2a.
• Suspension cell cultures: Pellet up to 5 × 106 cells for 5 minutes at 300 × g;                                                 remove the culture medium completely and discard. Continue with step 2a.
Note: Cells can be harvested, aliquotted into 1.5 mL micocentrifuge tubes and flash-frozen                                                 in liquid nitrogen, then stored at –70 °C for several months before preparing DNA.
b. Resuspend cells
Resuspend the pellet thoroughly in 200 µL of Resuspension Solution. If previously                                                 frozen, allow the cell pellet to thaw slightly before resuspending. If residual RNA                                                 is not a concern, continue with step 3a.
Optional RNase A treatment: If RNA-free genomic DNA is required, add 20 µL of RNase                                                 A Solution and incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature, then continue with step                                                 3a.
c. Lyse cells
Add 20 µL of the Proteinase K solution to the sample, followed by 200 µL of Lysis                                                 Solution C (B8803). Vortex thoroughly (about 15 seconds), and incubate at 70 °C for                                                 10 minutes. A homogeneous mixture is essential for efficient lysis. Continue with                                                 step 4.
DNA Isolation From All Listed Sample Types
2. Column preparation
Add 500 µL of the Column Preparation Solution to each pre-assembled GenElute Miniprep                                                 Binding Column (with a red o-ring, not to be confused with other GenElute kits) and                                                 centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard flowthrough liquid.
Note: The Column Preparation Solution maximizes binding of DNA to the membrane resulting in more consistent yields.
3. Prepare for binding
Add 200 µL of ethanol (95–100%) to the lysate; mix thoroughly by vortexing 5–10                                                 seconds. A homogeneous solution is essential.
4. Load lysate
Transfer the entire contents of the tube into the treated binding column from step                                                 4. Use a wide bore pipette tip to reduce shearing the DNA when transferring contents                                                 into the binding column. Centrifuge at ≥6500 × g for 1 minute. Discard the collection                                                 tube containing the flowthrough liquid and place the binding column in a new 2 mL                                                 collection tube.
5. First wash
Prior to first use, dilute the Wash Solution Concentrate with ethanol as described                                                 under Preparation Instructions. Add 500 µL of Wash Solution to the binding column                                                 and centrifuge for 1 minute at ≥6,500 × g. Discard the collection tube containing                                                 the flow-through liquid and place the binding column in a new 2 mL collection tube.
6. Second wash
Add another 500 µL of Wash Solution to the binding column; centrifuge for 3 minutes                                                 at maximum speed (12,000-16,000 × g) to dry the binding column. The binding column                                                 must be free of ethanol before eluting the DNA. Centrifuge the column for one additional                                                 minute at maximum speed if residual ethanol is seen. You may empty and re-use the                                                 collection tube if you need this additional centrifugation step. Finally, discard                                                 the collection tube containing the flowthrough liquid and place the binding column                                                 in a new 2 mL collection tube.
7. Elute DNA
Pipette 200 µL of the Elution Solution directly into the center of the binding column;                                                 centrifuge for 1 minute at ≥6,500 × g to elute the DNA. To increase the elution efficiency,                                                 incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature after adding the Elution Solution, then                                                 centrifuge.
Optional: A second elution can be collected by repeating step 9 with an additional                                                 200 µL of Elution Solution and eluting into a new 2 mL collection tube (provided)                                                 or into the same 2 mL collection tube as used for the first eluate.
The eluate contains pure genomic DNA. For short term storage of DNA, 2–8 °C is recommended.                                                 For long-term storage of DNA, -20 °C is recommended. Avoid freezing and thawing,                                                 which causes breaks in the DNA strand. The Elution Solution will help stabilize the                                                 DNA at these temperatures.

3. For each well of cells to be transfected, dilute 0.5 μg of DNA in 100 μl of Opti-MEM®I                                                 Reduced Serum Media without serum.
4. For each well of cells, add 0.75-1.75 μl of Lipofectamine LTX™Reagent into the                                                 above diluted Opti-MEM®:DNA solution, mix gently and incubate 30 minutes at room                                                 temperature to form DNA- Lipofectamine LTX™Reagent complexes.
5. After 30 minute incubation, add 100 μl of the DNA- Lipofectamine LTX™Reagent                                                 complexes directly to each well containing cells and mix gently by r℃king the plate                                                 back and forth.
6. Complexes do not have to be removed following transfection. Incubate the cells                                                 at 37℃ in a CO2 incubator for 18-24 hours post-transfection before assaying for transgene                                                 expression.
Lentivirus Infection
1. Seed cells at appropriate density in 6 ml in 6 cm plates.
a Adherent cells: seed 1 day prior to infection.
b Suspension cells: seed day of infection in media containing polybrene.
2. Add virus to cells:
(Adherent cells): Remove growth media and add fresh media containing polybrene.                                                 Alternatively, remove a portion of the growth media and supplement with media containing                                                 polybrene. Adjust volumes and polybrene concentration to achieve the correct final                                                 polybrene concentration (8 μg/ml).
3. Viral infection:
Incubate cells overnight.
Change media 24 h post-infection. Remove media and replace with 6 ml fresh growth                                                 media. If antibiotics selection is desired, use fresh growth media containing antibiotics.
Note: Puromycin concentration should be optimized for each cell line; typical concentrations                                                 range from 2-5 μg/ml.
4. Incubate cells, replacing growth media (with antibiotics, if desired) as needed                                                 every few days. Incubation periods are highly dependent on the post-infection assay.
Note: All lentiviral pocedures should be carried out in accordance with biosafety                                                 requirements of the host institution.
