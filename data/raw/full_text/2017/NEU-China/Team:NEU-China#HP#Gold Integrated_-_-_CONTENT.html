                                        We want to see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a random survey online and we also
                                        went out onto the street to send out some of the questionnaires and we want to thank
                                        Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires in their city.

                                        First, we came to the high school campus, we introduced our project to high school students so that they have a preliminary
                                        understanding of ismeller. We have also carried out a series of interactions and
                                        they have raised a lot of interesting proposals to us. For example, a boy who had
                                        a strong interest in ismeller had a strong desire to join us. He made a bold idea
                                        which was making an easily-carried &quot;police nose&quot; with iSmeller to replace the police
                                        dog.

                                    </H2><H2>

                                        On the open day of the lab, we also invited high school students and their parents who were interested in synthetic biology
                                        to visit our labs.

                                    </H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="page-breadcrumb"><DIV class="vertical-center sun"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="action"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H1 class="title">iSmeller University Campus Publicity</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="blog-details" class="padding-top" style="padding-top: 0px;"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-9 col-sm-7" style="width: auto;"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><DIV class="single-blog blog-details two-column"><DIV class="post-content overflow"><H2>
                                        We hope that our human practice can be known by more people in various fields and stimulate their interest in synthetic biology
                                        and our projects. Therefore we still showed our projects to various professional
                                        students such as software engineering on the university campus.We had a positive
                                        communication. It was interesting that a student thought iSmeller could be made into
                                        a sensitive biosensor thereby it could be applied to test whether the fruit was fresh,
                                        biosensor would simplify our testing process and made the detection process more
                                        quickly, the results more intuitive and imageable. We are very grateful to all the
                                        students for their recommendations of the professional. This will have a far-reaching
                                        impact on our future work.

                                        Then we held an outdoor workshop after the National Holiday near our college activity center. We taught people how to use
                                        microscope. Some people who have no biological background saw the tissue sections
                                        for the first time of their life.

                                        In addition, we have also organized a biology modeling contest, inviting all students who were interested in biological participation,
                                        and made a biological model with their own hands.

                                        In addition, during the opening day of our college, we did a presentation to spread the iGEM concepts and iGEM spirits to
                                        our freshmen students, and the freshmen actually showed great enthusiasm in being
                                        a part of the iGEMers. We also organized them to take part in our project, we taught
                                        them how to extract the plasmid and gave them the bacteria liquid of our vector pcDNA3.1+
                                        to complete their experiement.
                                    </H2><H2>

                                        We also communicated with them about iSmeller’s application. We want to know their expectations to the application of iSmeller.
                                        After several interesting communiation, we found that it could be used for the detection
                                        of cancer odor. It is reported that different cancers could emit different scents,
                                        and we envision that iSmeller can detect early cancer by identifying different scents.

                                        sections and other means of the patient itself has some damage, and may even cause
                                        the proliferation of tumor cells, aggravate the condition. And our project had application
                                        prospects, especially for the detection of diabetes. And Doctor Yu, the deputy Chief
                                        Physician in Chinese People 's Liberation Army 476th Hospital, said that it could

                                        the associated disease odor, or to detect urine odor, but the interference was large.

                                        olfactory signal amplification pathway and successfully enhanced the sensitivity
                                        of our biosensor to odor identification.
                                         • For some interferential smell caused by the fungi, because our olfactory receptor
                                        can only be combined with its specific odor, no matter what interferential odor exist,
                                        our ismeller can specifically identify the corresponding odor.
                                         • Because some tumor cells emit a variety of mixed odors, we intend to introduce
                                        multiple olfactory receptors into one cell to achieve specific detection of multiple
                                        odor to enhance the accuracy of cancer detection.
