It is worth mentioning that our ismeller has an extensive application prospects, such as making an easily-carried                         "police nose" to replace the police dog, detecting the ingredients of the plant oil, or making a                         food quality control. What’s more, it can also detect the environmental pollution. In addition, iSmeller                         can not only be used as wine composition testing but also detect the indoor air quality. Last but                         not least, it is promised for iSmeller to be used as a method of early detection of cancer based                         on different tumor cells emitting different VOCs.
Now we will introduce the applications of our iSmeller in detail.
Promised Applications
> Police Nose
We went to the high school campus, we introduced our project to high school students so that they have                         a preliminary understanding of ismeller. A boy who had a strong interest in ismeller had a strong                         desire to join us. He made a bold idea which was making an easily-carried "police nose" with iSmeller                         to replace the police dog.
> Detection the ingredients of plant oil
We have interviewed the owner of the plant essential oil shop, she told us that many of the cheap oil                         on the market is not extracted from the plant but by the synthesis of chemical flavors. From this                         situation, we thought that we could use our system to detect the ingredients of the plant oil to                         make sure whether it is extracted from the plant exactly.
> Food quality control
Food will produce ethylene when it is ripe, and when the amount of ethylene is too much, the food may                         be rotten. Eating out this period of food may cause harm to the human body. So we can use iSmeller                         to detect food quality.
> Environmental pollution evaluation
When there is pollution on environment, especially on water, the water will produce irritating odors.                         We can use iSmeller to detect what kind of the material content exceeded and take a solution to this                         problem.
> Wine composition testing
Many of the bad wine in the alcohol component is not ethanol but methanol, if it is drunk, there will                         have a lot of damage to the human body. As a result, iSmeller can be used as wine composition testing                         so that we can drink wine safely.
> Indoor air quality testing
Many of the decoration materials contain formaldehyde, formaldehyde has great harm for human health.                         Using iSmeller to detect the indoor air quality, we can make sure that we live in a healthy flat.
> Early detection of cancer
It is known that in cancerous cells, a change in the rate of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and                         gene sequences leads to abnormalities in the biochemical pathways of these cells and thus to the                         production of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs). As a result, it is promised for iSmeller                         to be used as a method of early detection of cancer.
