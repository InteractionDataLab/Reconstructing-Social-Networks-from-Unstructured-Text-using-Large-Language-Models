Questionnaires
We want to see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a random survey online and we also went out onto the street to send out some of the questionnaires and we want to thank Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires in their city.
iSmeller University Campus Publicity
We hope that our human practice can be known by more people in various fields and stimulate their interest in synthetic biology and our projects. Therefore, we still showed our projects to various professional students such as software engineering on the university campus. We had a positive communication. It was interesting that a student thought iSmeller could be made into a sensitive biosensor thereby it could be applied to test whether the fruit was fresh, biosensor would simplify our testing process and made the detection process more quickly, the results more intuitive and imageable. We are very grateful to all the students for their recommendations of the professional. This will have a far-reaching impact on our future work.
