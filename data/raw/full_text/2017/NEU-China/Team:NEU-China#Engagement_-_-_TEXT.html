Education and Public Engagement
Our team's human practice is committed to education and public engagement.
1. In order to make the public know about the synthetic biology and IGEM, we did different education                         and public engagement to different groups.
For example, for high school students, we introduced the knowledge of synthetic biology to them and invited                         them to visit our laboratory, which increased the interest of high school students in biology, so                         that they have a general understanding of biology.
For the freshmen in our specialty, we introduced the spirits of IGEM and our project to them and let                         them get involved our project to enrich their expertise so that they can have an in-depth understanding                         of our specialty.
For higher-grade students, we hold a biological model game to raise their interest, which let them make                         biological models by their own hand with the knowledge they learnt. This is a good oppotunity for                         them to improve their practical ability and also improve the fun of biology.
For non-professional backgrounds, we generalized some related biological knowledge, such as how to observe                         tissue sections to improve their understanding of the microstructure of human tissue.
2. We spread the common smell of life as well as the risk of some smell to the public.
For example, the quality of the plant oil can be identifiedby detecting the specific odor it cotains.                         And also it can detect the indoor air quality so that we can enjoy a safe and healthy life......Our                         iSmeller can be used to detect these smell in life, as a result, we simply intrduced the principles                         and various applicationsof iSmeller in our handbook. We hope that this handbook could make people                         understand and pay attention to the widespread smell in life, and understand the various applications                         of iSmeller.
