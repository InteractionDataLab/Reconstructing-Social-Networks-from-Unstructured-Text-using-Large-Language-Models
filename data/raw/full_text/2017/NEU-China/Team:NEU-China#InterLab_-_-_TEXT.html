Interlab Measurement Study
The Interlab Study is an initiative started in 2014 by the iGEM foundation to collect standard measurement data from around the world. This year, as a part of the measurement track, we completed the Interlab study according to the directions provided on the iGEM Interlab Study webpage. The purpose of this year's study was to measure the absorbance and fluorescence of three different GFP containing devices as well as a positive and negative control. The absorbance and fluorescence of a series of diluted fluorescein solution samples and LUDOX-S40 served as measurement standards. Below, we have detailed our procedures, implications of our results, and conclusions we have drawn that relate back to our main focus of evolutionary stability in synthetic biology. In synthetic biology, it is important that part characterization is consistent between different labs to create well-defined standard parts for the Registry. We are excited to contribute to this study!
Protocols
Calibration Protocols
◻ Add 100 μl LUDOX into wells A1, B1, C1, D1 (or 1 mL LUDOX into cuvette)
◻ Add 100 μl of H 2 O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2 (or 1 mL H 2 O into cuvette)
◻ Measure absorbance 600 nm of all samples in all standard measurement modes in instrument
◻ Record the data in the table below or in the notebook
◻ Import data into Excel ( OD600 reference point tab ) Sheet_1 provided
Protocol fluorescein fluorescence standard curve
Prepare the fluorescein stock solution:
◻ Spin down fluorescein stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube.
◻ Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 μM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of 1xPBS.
◻ Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution and resulting concentration of fluorescein stock solution 50 μM (500μL of 2x fluorescein in 500 μL 1x PBS will make 1 mL of 50 μM (1x) fluorescein solution.)
Prepare the serial dilutions of fluorescein:
◻ Add 100 μl of PBS into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12
◻ Add 200 μl of fluorescein 1x stock solution into A1, B1, C1, D1
◻ Transfer 100 μl of fluorescein stock solution from A1 into A2.
◻ Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A3…
◻ Mix A3 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A4...
◻ Mix A4 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A5...
◻ Mix A5 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A6...
◻ Mix A6 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A7...

◻ Repeat dilution series for rows B, C, D
◻ Measure fluorescence of all samples in all standard measurement modes in instrument
◻ Record the data in the notebook
◻ Import data into Excel (fluorescein standard curve tab ) Sheet_1 provided
Cell measurement protocol
Day 1 :
transform Escherichia coli DH5α with provided plasmids:
Day 2:
Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate it on 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol.
Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Day 3 : Cell growth, sampling, and assay
◻ Set the instrument to read OD600 (as OD calibration setting)
◻ Measure OD600 of the overnight cultures
◻ Record data in the notebook
◻ Import data into Excel ( Dilution Calculation ) Sheet_1 provided
◻ Dilute the cultures to a target OD 600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel ( Dilution Calculation ) Sheet_1) in 12 m l LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube (amber, or covered with foil to block light).
◻ Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm.
◻ Take 500 μL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation. (At each time point, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a total of 16 samples per time point)
◻ Place samples on ice.
◻ At the end of sampling point, measure the samples (OD and Fl measurement), see the below for details.
◻ Record data in the notebook
◻ Import data into Excel ( cell measurement tab ) Sheet_1 provided
