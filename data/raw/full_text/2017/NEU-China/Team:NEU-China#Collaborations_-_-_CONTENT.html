                                        We have established the collaborative relationship with Jilin_China, LanZhou and ZJU_China during the competition. We have
                                        made effective communication in terms of experimental condition control and results
                                        testing, and we helped each other so that our projects progress more smoothly. We
                                        are very grateful to these teams mentioned above for help.

                                        With Jilin_China

                                    </H2><H3>We had a lot of discussion with Jilin University about interlab such as experimental
                                        conditions control and operation practices. During our human practice, we want to
                                        see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a
                                        random survey online and we also went out onto the street to send out some of the
                                        questionnaires and we want to thank Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires
                                        in their city. This makes our findings more convincing.
                                    </H3><H3>  Jilin_China wanted to get more opinions of their project, so we helped them interview associated professor Peiyong Liu, vice Dean of college of life and health sciences Northeastern University. We told her what Geneguard is, and discussed with her. Peiyong Liu thought the usage of Geneguard system was an innovative idea and it was feasible to control the engineered bacteria in the environment. She thought Jilin_China 's project is meaningful, and it is a nice attempt to solve this problem by using synthetic biology methods.

                                        With LanZhou

                                    </H2><H3>The ecdysone receptor (ECR) plays an important role in the molting, metabolism, development
                                        and reproduction of insects. They tried to build an RNAi system to silence the ECR
                                        gene.ECR silencing can effectively reduce the expression of these key genes, thereby
                                        reducing the survival rate of insects and reproduction rate.
                                         In their project, they need various functional vectors for dsRNA production, but
                                        the gene sequence complementarity will cause secondary structure, which is impossible
                                        to synthsize gene for one time. The task of constructing vectors is heavy. We helped
                                        them to construct hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which sped up their vectors construction
                                        progress.

                                    </H2><H3>Teammates of Lanzhou helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor
                                        Rho-OR1A1. Since the position of the initiation codon 64bp in the OR1A1 sequence
                                        contained the EcoRI site which did not conform to the RFC10 standard, they used the
                                        primer containing the synonymous codon to mutate the site and successfully mutated
                                        the GAA to GAG.

                                    </H2><H3>Another partner was ZJU_China, we had a leisure talk about projects with their teammates
                                        in their laboratory in the end of the July.We later had collaborated in fluorescence
                                        detection tests. In their project, they only observed the fluorescence by fluorescence
                                        microscope, while we used Microplate Reader to detect the EGFP expression in the
                                        hyphae of T. atroviridewe.
                                         First, we cultured Trichoderma that has been transformed EGFP and wild Trichoderma,
                                        and then we picked mycelium for fluorescence detection, the following table for the
                                        data:
                                    </H3><H3>
                                        The data we provided them were more quantitatively and measurable which proved that they have succeed in expressing heterogenous
                                        gene in our aiming chassis.

                                        For us:

                                    </H2><H3>The iSmeller biosensor constructed in our project will activate the cAMP pathway after
                                        binding of the odor molecule with specific olfactory receptor. To determine whether
                                        the activation of the cAMP pathway can be used as a test indicator for our reporter
                                        gene (luciferase), the igem team of Zhejiang University has helped us to make a luminescence
                                        detection by stimulation of forskolin which is a kind of adenylate cyclase activator.
                                        Demonstrating that our reporter gene is available to respond to the activation of
                                        the cAMP pathway, which further proves the feasibility of our experiment.

                                        With NKU_China 

                                    </H2><H3>We also helped Nankai University to verify the function of the lyase gene. We synthesize the lyase gene whose sequence from Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp10 and transformed it into Enterobacter sp. FY-07. After we added the inducer (arabinose), it is obvious that the bacteria begin to die which will ensure that the bacteria will die after working, and will not affect the environment.

                                        Teammates of NKU_China helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor Rho-OR1D2.

                                        Abstract

                                    </H2><H3>During the competition, we realize that proper collaborations with the above team is
                                        necessary, which make our project progress more smoothly. In addition, frequent communication
                                        allows us to know about the progress of other teams to determine whether we need
                                        to speed up the pace of the experiment. But we found that the Chinese teams rarely
                                        establish a cooperative relationship with the igem teams in other countries, which
                                        may be due to geographical relations. However, we still believe that cooperation
                                        with foreign teams is necessary for we can understand each other's experimental techniques
                                        to improve our own projects. In any case, we are very grateful to the above team
                                        for our help and we hope that our friendship can last forever.
