Rho-OR1A1(HEK293): Encoding the fragments of the olfactory receptor OR1A1 with Rho-tag in its N-terminal in HEK293 cells. Once the specific odor, β-citronellol, binds to OR1A1 on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. The Rho tag was added to its N-terminal, which could improve the olfactory receptor to express on the surface of HEK293.
Rho-OR1D2(HEK293): Encoding the fragments of the olfactory receptor OR1D2 with Rho-tag in its N-terminal in HEK293 cells. Once the specific odor, bourgeonal, binds to OR1D2 on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. The Rho tag was added to its N-terminal, which could improve the olfactory receptor to express on the surface of HEK293.
