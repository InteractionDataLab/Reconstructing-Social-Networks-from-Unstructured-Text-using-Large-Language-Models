We have established the collaborative relationship with Jilin_China, LanZhou and ZJU_China during the competition. We have made effective communication in terms of experimental condition control and results                                         testing, and we helped each other so that our projects progress more smoothly. We                                         are very grateful to these teams mentioned above for help.
HELPING SECTION
With Jilin_China
We had a lot of discussion with Jilin University about interlab such as experimental                                         conditions control and operation practices. During our human practice, we want to                                         see how the public react to their own health status, to our project, so we did a random survey online and we also went out onto the street to send out some of the                                         questionnaires and we want to thank Jilin University for helping us to send our questionnaires                                         in their city. This makes our findings more convincing.
Jilin_China wanted to get more opinions of their project, so we helped them interview associated professor Peiyong Liu, vice Dean of college of life and health sciences Northeastern University. We told her what Geneguard is, and discussed with her. Peiyong Liu thought the usage of Geneguard system was an innovative idea and it was feasible to control the engineered bacteria in the environment. She thought Jilin_China 's project is meaningful, and it is a nice attempt to solve this problem by using synthetic biology methods.

EXPERIMENT SECTION
With LanZhou
The ecdysone receptor (ECR) plays an important role in the molting, metabolism, development                                         and reproduction of insects. They tried to build an RNAi system to silence the ECR                                         gene.ECR silencing can effectively reduce the expression of these key genes, thereby                                         reducing the survival rate of insects and reproduction rate.
In their project, they need various functional vectors for dsRNA production, but                                         the gene sequence complementarity will cause secondary structure, which is impossible                                         to synthsize gene for one time. The task of constructing vectors is heavy. We helped                                         them to construct hpRNA producing vector ecrL, which sped up their vectors construction                                         progress.
For us:
Teammates of Lanzhou helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor                                         Rho-OR1A1. Since the position of the initiation codon 64bp in the OR1A1 sequence                                         contained the EcoRI site which did not conform to the RFC10 standard, they used the                                         primer containing the synonymous codon to mutate the site and successfully mutated                                         the GAA to GAG.
With ZJU_China
Another partner was ZJU_China, we had a leisure talk about projects with their teammates                                         in their laboratory in the end of the July.We later had collaborated in fluorescence                                         detection tests. In their project, they only observed the fluorescence by fluorescence                                         microscope, while we used Microplate Reader to detect the EGFP expression in the                                         hyphae of T. atroviridewe.
First, we cultured Trichoderma that has been transformed EGFP and wild Trichoderma,                                         and then we picked mycelium for fluorescence detection, the following table for the                                         data:
The data we provided them were more quantitatively and measurable which proved that they have succeed in expressing heterogenous                                         gene in our aiming chassis.
For us:
The iSmeller biosensor constructed in our project will activate the cAMP pathway after                                         binding of the odor molecule with specific olfactory receptor. To determine whether                                         the activation of the cAMP pathway can be used as a test indicator for our reporter                                         gene (luciferase), the igem team of Zhejiang University has helped us to make a luminescence                                         detection by stimulation of forskolin which is a kind of adenylate cyclase activator.                                         Demonstrating that our reporter gene is available to respond to the activation of                                         the cAMP pathway, which further proves the feasibility of our experiment.
With NKU_China
We also helped Nankai University to verify the function of the lyase gene. We synthesize the lyase gene whose sequence from Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp10 and transformed it into Enterobacter sp. FY-07. After we added the inducer (arabinose), it is obvious that the bacteria begin to die which will ensure that the bacteria will die after working, and will not affect the environment.
For us:
Teammates of NKU_China helped us to construct the distribution of the olfactory receptor Rho-OR1D2.
Abstract
During the competition, we realize that proper collaborations with the above team is                                         necessary, which make our project progress more smoothly. In addition, frequent communication                                         allows us to know about the progress of other teams to determine whether we need                                         to speed up the pace of the experiment. But we found that the Chinese teams rarely                                         establish a cooperative relationship with the igem teams in other countries, which                                         may be due to geographical relations. However, we still believe that cooperation                                         with foreign teams is necessary for we can understand each other's experimental techniques                                         to improve our own projects. In any case, we are very grateful to the above team                                         for our help and we hope that our friendship can last forever.
