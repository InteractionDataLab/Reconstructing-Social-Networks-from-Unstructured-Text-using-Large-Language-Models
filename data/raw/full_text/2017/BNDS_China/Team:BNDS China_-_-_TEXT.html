About our project:
γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) can be found in many plants and fermented foods and plays the role of inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. However, high GABA concentrated products can only be produced through the complicated procedures. Our project aims to develop GABA-enriched probiotics as food product including Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 through synthetic biology methods that may simplify the process of GABA production. In the bacterial way of GABA synthesis, two proteins, the glutamate:GABA antiporter (gadC) and the glutamate decarboxylase (gadA), form the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system. Though many bacteria incorporate these two genes, we select these genes from Lactobacillus brevis NCL912, a Lactic Acid Bacteria that is able to produce high amount of GABA with unique GAD sequences.
