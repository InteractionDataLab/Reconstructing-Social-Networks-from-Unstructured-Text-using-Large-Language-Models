We run SDS-PAGE of samples of the raw enzyme, cell content obtained by 100 ˚C heating and wild type (shown in Figure 2). The protein CysDes is about 46kDa, we can find obvious bands at the about position of 45kDa which are unique to lanes of cell contents after induction and raw enzyme compared with the wild type. Although there are proteins of similar molecular weight in the wild type, darker bands in experiment group meaning a high amount of proteins could prove the existence of high amount of CysDes.

</P></DIV><DIV><SPAN id="forth" class="scrollspy label label-pink">4.Enzymatic activity analysis of CysDes in vitro</SPAN><P class="indent_word">To analyze the enzyme activity of CysDes, we choose to detect the concentration of S<SUP>2-</SUP> which is reduced from cysteine under the catalysis of CysDes. Because of lacking appropriate purifying methods, we just analyze the activity of the raw enzyme obtained via bacterial lysis. According to the method described in L.Chu et al. of hydrogen sulfide detection, we first cultivate the 1mL mixture of cysteine, PBS buffer and raw enzyme for 2h at 37 ˚C. Sulfide formation was determined by adding 0.1 ml of 0.02 M N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 N HCl and 0.1 ml of 0.3 M FeCl3 in 1.2 N HCl to the reaction tubes. The absorbance at 650 nm is determined after color development for 20 min at 20°C. Sulfide concentration is determined from the standard curve of Na<SUB>2</SUB>S. </P><P class="indent_word">From figure 4, the concentration of S<SUP>2-</SUP> in the group of CysDes is higher than the wild type which proves that CysDes promotes the reduction of cysteine to S<SUP>2-</SUP> with good enzymatic activity certainly. </P><P class="indent_word">Under the catalysis of same amount of the raw enzyme, we measure the production of S<SUP>2-</SUP> with various concentration of cysteine after 2h at 37˚C (shown in Figure 5). The value of OD<SUB>650</SUB> has approximate linear relationship with the concentration of cysteine which means CysDes almost catalyzes the reduction of all cysteine to S<SUP>2-</SUP> and CysDes functions well. </P><DIV class="col s6"><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 4.

However, in this photocatalyst system, the duty of this enzyme does NOT just stop here. It needs to precipitate CdS nanoparticles with additional Cd<SUP>2+</SUP> ions in the system. In the toxicity text section, we can see that strain expressing CysDes had a better resistance than wild type strain. This primarily proves the assumption that this enzyme can enhance the bacteria’s resistance to Cd<SUP>2+</SUP> ions by precipitating them.</P><P class="indent_word">To valid this assumption further more, we used Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to take a closer look to the bacteria. With this, we can valid the existence of CdS precipitance with our own eyes!</P><P class="indent_word">Here, we need to express our most sincere gratitude to those teachers in Center for Integrative Imaging(Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale). They helped us to process those samples for TEM.</P><P class="indent_word">We prepared four samples—the strain expressing CysDes with and without additional Cd<SUP>2+</SUP> in it and the same for the wild type strain. Here are the results for these four samples.</P><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 6. TEM results(from 1 to 5: WT, WT+Cd<SUP>2+</SUP>, CysDes, CysDes+Cd<SUP>2+</SUP>,CysDes+Cd<SUP>2+</SUP>)</P><P class="indent_word">As you can see in these five pictures, compared with other samples, group 4 and 5 had more precipitations on the surface of the bacteria significantly. Although we have followed every step in the protocol from other papers, our bacteria did NOT have so much precipitation as them. It may result from the fact that there are too many varieties in this experiments. So we could not repeat their results. However, these pictures still provide us with a solid evidence for our assumption! This enzyme can produce S<SUP>2-</SUP>, which can precipitate Cd<SUP>2+</SUP> to form CdS nanoparticles for our final goal——utilizing light energy to generate more electrons! </P></DIV><DIV><SPAN id="sixth" class="scrollspy label label-pink">6.Effect of CdS nanoparticles to cathode-current</SPAN><P class="indent_word">To see whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as we expected, we added CdS quantum dots kindly provided by team ShanghaiTech into the culture when we were forming bio-film onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically, CdS quantum dots would be attached to the surface of the bacteria as the bio-film is formed.</P><DIV class="col s6"><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 7. Preparation for bio-film</P></DIV><DIV class="col s6"><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 8. The way we gave light to the reaction system</P></DIV><P class="indent_word">Then, we put the cathode running and monitored the current. As you can see in figure 8, the strain pMC, which was co-expressing Mtr CAB and Ccm A-H, had a stronger cathode current than the WT strain before the light was given, which perfectly repeated the result we have done in the conduction system section. After the current was stable, we began to give light to the system. The light’s wave length is 455 nm and the source is a LED light bought from an online shop. The strain pMC with CdS quantum dots on it responded to the light stimulation. It had a stronger current than it was before the light was given. However, those strains without CdS quantum dots on it did NOT respond to light stimulate. Especially, for the pMC group without CdS quantum dots on it, it did NOT have any current change after we give light to the system, which exclude the possibility that the current change was resulted from the Mtr CAB proteins or the Ccm A-H protein. Moreover, after we stopped the light, the current got back to the level it was before we gave the light. </P><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 9. Cathode current</P><P class="indent_word">This strongly proved the assumption we had that the CdS can increase cathode current, which means that CdS quantum dots can speed up the electrons transfer process, pumping more electrons from the electrode to the bacteria in the same time utilizing light energy. This may results from the CdS quantum dots’ property as a semi-conductor. In the design part about this photosynthesis system, we have a detailed introduction about light-catalyze of semi-conductor. With light energy, we can active the electrons to the conduction band and also create a hole spontaneously. Then the hole will be filled up with the electrons from the electrode. So the cathode current getl increased.</P><P class="indent_word">In a word, with this outcome, we can conclude that CdS quantum dots do increase the cathode current with its semi-conductor property. So, with this photosynthesis system, we can further increase the speed of the electron transfer process which leads to the improvement of synthesis efficiency.</P><P class="get_bold1">Reference:</P>
