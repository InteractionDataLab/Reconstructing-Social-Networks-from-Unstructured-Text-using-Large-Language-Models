Science and Technology Week
Science and Technology Week is an on-campus annually celebration of science, technology, and engineering                     involving different colleges students in USTC conducting various science-based activities. This year,                     Science and Technology Week attracted over ten thousand citizens to USTC, varying from innocent pupils,                     high school students and college students in biology-related majors to the public from all walks who                     may have limited knowledge of Synthetic Biology. Our team cooperated with Team USTC and offered visitors                     a feast of biological knowledge.
We introduced elementary knowledge of genetics to citizens by poster presentation, then showed them some                     basic experiment operation, like liquid relief, centrifugation and etc. We used metaphors of LEGO and                     principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic Biology. Whatâ€™s more, the                     game Foldit is used to give children a vivid model of protein. In addition, we distributed questionnaires                     to the visitors to get some feedback to improve the design idea of our software.

Science and Technology Exhibition
We held a Synthetic Biology exhibition in Hefei science museum, which is the largest off-campus science class.                     This exhibition attracts thousands of citizens including innocent pupils, high school students and their                     parents. And our team coordinated with team USTC and provide a flood of synthetic knowledge to the visitors.
We used metaphors of LEGO and principle of programming to introduce the concept of biobricks and Synthetic                     Biology. In addition, we invited teenagers to play Foldit (an online puzzle video game about protein                     folding) to give them a sense of computer-aided design. We also prepared several games so that they could                     learn knowledge while having fun.
