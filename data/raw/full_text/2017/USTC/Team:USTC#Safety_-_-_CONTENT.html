There was nothing harmful to the public or environment. However, H<SUB>2</SUB>S and CdS, potential products in our photosynthesis system, might have been a risk for us, the researchers and we solved the problem successfully with the help of our universities and the SRB Safety Handbook of the team UNITN-Trento in 2012.</P><P class=" label label-pink title_indent">Bacterial strains</P><P class="indent_word">We worked with non-pathogenic E.coli strains---Top 10 to amplify our plasmids and BL21(DE3) to express our target proteins in most experiments. To find out whether CdS nanoparticles can generate electrons or not, we used a bacteria called Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which are non-pathogenic and well-characterized.</P><P class=" label label-pink title_indent">Parts</P><P class="indent_word">None of the new parts will raise safety issues for further applications except for the parts with the CysDes (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2242233">BBa_K2242233</A>, <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2242633">BBa_K2242633</A>). We realized these parts would produce hydrogen sulfide at a very low concentration after induced from the wiki of team UNITN-Trento in 2012 at the beginning of our research. We stressed H<SUB>2</SUB>S issue again on the main page of the Parts that we submitted. When we did related research about Cysteine Desulfhydrase in our photosynthesis system.</P><P class="label label-pink title_indent">H<SUB>2</SUB>S</P><P class="indent_word">We knew that H<SUB>2</SUB>S, a toxic substance, would be produced at a very low concentrations when Cysteine Desulfhydrase, an important enzyme in our photosynthesis system, was induced. Before experiments started, we read the wiki of the team UNITN-Trento in 2012 and other references to find a solution. We did all the experiments involved in the bacteria producing H<SUB>2</SUB>S in specific hoods. We used a separate waste container to dispose of bacteria producing H<SUB>2</SUB>S. Eventually, these media and cultures were properly disposed in terms of the way mentioned in our “Protection Guide of lab work”.</P><P class="indent_word">As for further application in factories, the problem of tiny amounts of H<SUB>2</SUB>S releasing is easy to solve with a  well ventilation system and respiratory, skin and eye protection provided.</P><P class=" label label-pink title_indent">CdS</P><P class="indent_word">Nano CdS can be toxic if not handled correctly. In our experiments, we recovered nano CdS by means of centrifugation and encapsulated it to ensure no direct interaction with environment. Ultimately, the hazardous waste was collected by our schools and disposed properly.</P><P class="indent_word">When our project is performed in factories in future, nano CdS can be recovered properly and then applied in other area such as a semiconductor.</P></DIV><DIV><P id="second" class="scrollspy massive label label-pink z-depth-5">Lab safety</P><P class="indent_word">We did nothing that would raise any safety concerns for the public or environment.

Before we started experiments in the lab, we received some training from Ms. ZhangQian, one of administrators of our school.

Then we wrote a brief protection guide to warning ourselves about the safety when working in the lab.</P><P class="indent_word">In May, our lab delivered a lecture to emphasize the importance of the safety and discussed that how to deal with the potential risk about H<SUB>2</SUB>S and CdS when we would express the Cysteine Desulfhydrase.</P><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 1: Scene of the lecture about safety</P><P class="label label-pink title_indent">Protection Guide of lab work</P><P style="text-align:center!important">Figure 2: Our protection guide (details are shown as follows)</P><P style="text-align:center!important"><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/8/8c/USTC-safety_handbook.pdf" class="indent_word">Click here to download the full version of this handbook!</A></P><P class="get_bold1 indent_word">Personal Protection</P><P class="indent_word">1.
