This year we, team USTC, submitted 5 basic parts. All of them are coding part as we did not use any special promoters or RBS in our project. Among these five basic parts, two of them are new, including reductase CmCR and KmAdh.

BBa_K2242363
Mtr CAB
Coding
5210
It consists of 3 proteins, Mtr A, Mtr B and Mtr C, which plays the role as electron tunnel to transfer extracellular electrons into the cytoplasm.
It comes from the kit plate from iGEM 2017.
BBa_K2242666
Ccm A-H
Coding
6290
Its full name is Cytochrome c Maturation, which can mature Mtr CAB and enable it to function as we expected.
We cloned this gene ccm A-H from the genome of an E.coli strain BL21(DE3).
BBa_K2242233
CysDes
Coding
1203
Cysteine Desulfhydrase is an aminotransferase that converts cysteine into pyruvate, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide. In our project, we use it to generate Cd2+
Synthesized by IDT.
As this aminotransferase can produce hydrogen sulfide and CdS nanoparticles if S2-is in the system, special measures must be taken.
BBa_K2242180
Reductase CmCR
Coding
873
This reductase CmCR is a NADH-dependent reductase which can catalyze the bio-transformation from COBE to (S)-CHBE.
Kindly provide by Prof.Hong Jiong
As COBE is harmful to our skin and respiratory tract with pungent smell, special measures must be taken.
BBa_K2242626
Reductase KmAdh
Coding
888
KmAdh is an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces marxianus. It can catalyze the ethanol fermentation ongoing in the bacteria with a high efficiency and mild reaction condition, especially temperature.
