This year we, team USTC, submitted 7 basic parts. All of them are coding part as we did not use any special promoters or RBS in our project. These parts are different proteins that we have used in our project under control of different promoter or operator.

araC+pBAD+CmCR
Coding
2089
To induce the gene expression, we use a promotor called pBAD, which is induced by arabinose.
The plasmid is bought from a bio-company. The reductase CmCR’s gene is kindly provided by Prof.HongJiong. The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.
The substrate of this reductase is COBE, which is an organic compound with a pungent smell. More importantly, it’s harmful to our skin and respiratory tract. So during the experiment process, we need to take up certain measures to protect ourselves.
BBa_K2242521
placI+lacI+pTAC+CmCR
Coding
2326
We use a promoter pTAC to control the gene CmCR’s expression, which is induced by IPTG.
The plasmid backbone pYYDT is kindly provided by Prof. Yu Hanqing. The gene CmCR is kindly provided by Prof. Hong Jiong. The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.

BBa_K2242018
T7+LacO+Mtr
Coding
5272
We use T7 promoter and Lac operator to control Mtr CAB’s expression. Both of this two units are induced by IPTG. With this dual switch, we can reduce the leak of the gene expression as much as possible.
The plasmid is bought from a bio-company. The Mtr gene is obtained from the kit plate. The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.
BBa_K2242419
pTET+ccm
Coding
6372
We use a constitutively on promoter pTET to control gene ccmA-H’s expression.
The plasmid backbone and the promoter pTET is from the kit plate. The ccm A-H gene is amplified from the genome of an E.coli strain BL21(DE3). The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.
BBa_K2242633
pLuxR+CysDes
Coding
2367
We use the pLuxR promoter from the quorum sensing system, which can be induced by AHL.
The plasmid backbone and the promoter pLuxR is from the kit plate. The CysDes gene is synthesized by IDT. The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.
As this aminotransferase can produce hydrogen sulfide and CdS nanoparticles if S2-is in the system, special measures must be taken.
BBa_K2242005
T7+LacO+KmAdh
Coding
948
We use T7 promoter and Lac operator to control KMADH’s expression. Both of this two units are induced by IPTG. With this dual switch, we can reduce the leak of the gene expression as much as possible.
The plasmid is bought from a bio-company. The Mtr gene is kindly provided by Prof.HongJiong. The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.
BBa_K2242384
placI+lacI+pTAC+KmAdh
Coding
2341
To express this reductase KMADH in Shewallena, we construct a shuttle plasmid. On this plasmid, we use this pTAC to control its expression, which is induced by IPTG.
The plasmid backbone pYYDT is kindly provided by Prof. Yu Hanqing. The gene KMADH is kindly provided by Prof. Hong Jiong. The recombinant plasmid is constructed by ourselves.
