Here’s our suggestions about their search engine—Bio-Designer-Dolphin. </P><P class="indent_word">The searching engine—bio-designer-dophin, is very powerful. It consists of 4 different parts. The first one, the searching section, is the most useful tool on this website. Just type in the key words you are interested in, the Dophin will tell you all projects in iGEM competition over the last 12 years that are associated with your key words. For example, this year, our project is about bio-cathode, so the first try I did was to search bio-cathode. A few seconds later, all projects about bio-cathode would come up to me. No matter the awards they got or the biobricks they had submitted to the HQ would be sorted out. Then you can have a general understanding to this project. This function is so great as there have not been any search engine that is serve for iGEM competition especially. Besides, it also provides us a platform to design our project online, drawing out the gene circuit with any biobrick you want. Though it still has some problems if we want to search out the proper biobrick we want to use when we are designing. Thirdly, it also have a section called “Gene relationship”. In this part, the Dophin will show you the genes that have close relationship to the one you concern. This two parts can help us design and optimize our gene circuit more conveniently. The last section is called “System”. It’s a tool that you can use to search out the characterizations of some chemical compounds. </P></DIV><DIV><P id="second" class="scrollspy label label-pink">USTC-Software</P><P class="indent_word">UTSC-Software has been one of our traditional collabrators. Focusing on the establishment and improvement of a online synthetic biology community this year, we, as potential users of their bio-hub, provided our opinions and needs in application design and homepage design. For example, we suggested adding an online forum named &quot;iGEMers' Notebook&quot; in which iGEMers can exchange important information and ideas concerning this competition. We also helped them with biological problems they came across, such as the biological background of comparative sequence analysis. UTSC-Software shared with us some useful tricks and their experience in website making and modeling, which helped speed up our work.   </P></DIV><DIV><P id="third" class="scrollspy label label-pink">ShanghaiTech</P><P class="indent_word">Last year, team ShanghaiTech used CdS nanoparticles to utilize light energy. This year, coincidently, we also need to use CdS nanoparticles to generate electrons for photosynthesis. To have a positive control in our experiments, we use this CdS quantum dots to play the role of light catalyzer, proving that our concept can function as we expected. In addition, we also help them to make a further validation of the CdS quantum dots’s  function and improve the characterization of the CdS quantum dots.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Shanghaitech/Collaborations">Link in ShanghaiTech University's Wiki</A></P></DIV><DIV><P id="fourth" class="scrollspy label label-pink">NPU-China</P><P class="indent_word">For team NPU-China this year, they have a complex metabolism pathway to realize their goal—— synthesize as much DHAP as possible. To optimize the system, they want to adjust the ratio of two enzymes they use for DHAP synthesis. But to find out the best ratio of these two enzymes’ expression and the proper promotor or RBS we need to use, we need to model this metabolism pathway. This is where our team USTC put our efforts into. We help them to model this complex pathway and valid their project’s feasibility.</P></DIV><DIV><P id="fifth" class="scrollspy label label-pink">The 5th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference</P><P class="indent_word">This year has seen the third time Team USTC attending Asia-Parcific iGEM Conference held in National Chiao Tung University,Taiwan. The 5th iGEM Asia-Parcific conference lasted 4 days from July 31th,2016. More than 20 teams from Taiwan, mainland China, Japan and the United States got together to share our projects and culture. The conference included official presentations along with Q&amp;A and a poster session, which not only serves as a drill for the coming jamboree, but also inspires us with new ideas and valuable advice we can make good use of.Taking an active part in the conference, we shared our ideas and studies in synthetic biology and made a great deal new friends with different backgrounds. Happily it brought us the collabration with Shanghai Tech. We sincerely acknowledge NCTU for their warm services and we gained a lot through the conference.</P></DIV><DIV><P id="sixth" class="scrollspy label label-pink">Conference of China iGEMer Community</P><P class="indent_word">This year, we participated into a great party hosted by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University——Conference of China iGEMer community (also known as CCiC). During this conference, amazing presentations were performed to show out every team’s creative project. In addition, during the panel session, members from each team came up to the stage to share their memory in this iGEM competition, either the happiest one or the most sorrow one. Besides, we also share our experiences and obstacles we met during the last year.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col hide-on-small-only m1 12"><DIV class="toc-wrapper pinner" style="margin-left: 80px"><DIV><UL class="section table-of-contents"><LI><A href="#first">HFUT-China</A></LI><LI><A href="#second">USTC-Software</A></LI><LI><A href="#third">Shanghaitech </A></LI><LI><A href="#fourth">NPU-China</A></LI><LI><A href="#fifth">The 5th iGEM Asia-Parcific Conference </A></LI><LI><A href="#sixth">Conference of China iGEMer Community </A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></MAIN>iv&gt;
