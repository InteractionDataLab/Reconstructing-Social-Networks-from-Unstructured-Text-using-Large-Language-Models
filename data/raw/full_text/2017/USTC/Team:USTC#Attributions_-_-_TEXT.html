Most of the experiments were finished by ourselves, every members in our team! For example, experiments like molecular experiments, protein characterizations, bio-cathode construction and so on are performed by every great and intelligent member! Besides, we also got many help from professors and graduates which makes up an essential part for our success!!
Project Support and Advice
Prof. Hong Jiong
As the primary PI of our team, Prof. Hong provided us a great amount of help to us, either during the process of creating our project, or in the experiments. Here, we give our sincerely gratitude to Prof. Hong.
Prof. Liu Haiyan
As the secondary PI of our team, Prof. Liu provided a lot of help in modeling, help us to build up a more understandable and reasonable model for our project.
Prof. Chen Quan
During the process of molecular experiments, we came across many different problems that beyond our knowledge. Prof. Chen gave us many help in optimizing our molecular experiments.
Prof. Liu Xianwei
Since our project utilizes a bio-cathode to increase our system’s efficiency, we got a lot of help from Prof.Liu, who is familiar with the search field of bio-cathode.
Prof. Yu Hanqing
Since our project utilizes a bio-cathode to increase our system’s efficiency, we got a lot of help from Prof.Yu, who is familiar with the search field of bio-cathode.
Prof. Tang Yajun
During the process of molecular experiments, we came across many different problems that beyond our knowledge. Prof. Chen gave us many help in optimizing our molecular experiments.
Prof. Xiao Weihua
When we were confirming and optimizing our project, Prof. Zhao helped us a lot.
Prof. Zang Jianye
When we were confirming and optimizing our project, Prof. Zhao helped us a lot.
Prof. Zhao Zhong
When we were confirming and optimizing our project, Prof. Zhao helped us a lot.
Dr. Liu Dongfeng
During the experiments of the bio-cathode, as most of our team members did not know how to construct and measure all kinds of properties of a bio-cathode, Dr.Liu gave us a great amount of help.
Dr. Tang Qiang
During the experiments of the bio-cathode, as most of our team members did not know how to construct and measure all kinds of properties of a bio-cathode, Dr.Tang gave us a great amount of help.
Lab Support
Dr.Zhang Qian
As the teacher who ran the lab we used during the summer holiday, Zhang Qian gave us all kinds of supplies and taught us how to use the equipments in the lab.
Difficult Technique support
Dr. Li Jie
When we were doing the bio-cathode assay, Dr.Li help us a lot! From providing instruments to guiding us how to run a bio-cathode, he helped us so much!
Center for Integrative Imaging(Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale)
Thanks teachers in the center for helping us using the transmission electron microscopy to observe bacteria at the microscale!
Project Advisor Support
Prof. Hong Jiong
As the primary PI of our team, Prof. Hong provided us a great amount of help to us, either during the process of creating our project, or in the experiments. Here, we give our sincerely gratitude to Prof. Hong.
Team Training and Project Start
Course of Synthetic-Biology
Our PI Prof. HongJiong establish a course about Synthetic Biology for undergraduate student and members in us iGEM team. Besides, during each group meeting, Prof. Hong will come to mentor us and teach us many knowledge about synthetic biology and molecular biology.
Project Start
Every year we will build our team in November, after a long time research, we will confirm our project's content in May next year and begin our experiments!~
Feeling of Gratitude
Here we want to give our most sincere thankfulness to everyone that have helped us in our iGEM journey! Without you guys, we can never make this far! Thank you!
