Conduction System
Here, we confirmed the function of two parts in this system, the Ccm A-H protein complex and the Mtr CAB protein complex. First, we confirmed Ccm A-H can successfully mature Mtr CAB. Moreover, we also confirmed the function of the Mtr CAB protein. It can transfer extracellular electrons into the cytoplasm though it's heterologous expressed in E.coli, not its original host.

Photocatalyst System
Here, we proved that the cysteine desulfhydrase can generate S2- ions from cysteine. More importantly, we confirmed that this enzyme can precipitate a large amount of CdS sediments on the surface on the bacteria. Lastly, we also ensured the function of CdS nanoparticles--increasing the cathode current and electrons transfer efficiency.

Harvest System
We successfully purified the reductase KmAdh to measure its enzyme activity in vitro. In result, it was proved to have strong enzyme activity in vitro. Moreover, after toxicity test, we also measure its enzyme activity in vivo and it also functioned well !
