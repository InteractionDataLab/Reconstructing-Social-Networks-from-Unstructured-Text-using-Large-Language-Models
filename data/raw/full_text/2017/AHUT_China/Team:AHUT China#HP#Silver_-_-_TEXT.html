Self-improvement:
1.Liang Ma's advice:
Liang Ma is a master tutor in Department of Chemical Biology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Anhui University of Technology. He got his Ph. D. from University of Science and Technology of China in 2011. He was an assistant research fellow in Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science from 2011 to 2014,and then went to work in Anhui University of Technology.He implemented 1 project from Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and participated in several research projects of NSFC, National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) and Presidential Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, etc. He has published papers on journals such as Carcinogenesis, ACS medicinal chemistry, Molecules, Plos one, and so on. His research focuses on tumor pathogenesis, drug targets discovery and validation for cancer, anti-cancer compounds screening and mechanism research.
We discussed our project in Dr Ma's lab, and he made many valuable recommendations for our project.We took a lot of detours with Dr. Ma's help, and our doubts were satisfactorily answered.
 
  
2.HaoQian Zhang’s seminar in NAU:
Dr. HaoQian Zhang from Nanjing agricultural university. Nanjing university, Nanjing agricultural university, China medical university and some members of our team participated in the seminar
At the meeting, Dr. HaoQian Zhang told the following points:
(1) Process of synthetic biology;
(2) Traditional biology: Synthetic biology and the difficulties of it;
(3)Standardization: Sequence standardization, functional standardization, standardized measurement, standardized strains, data storage methods.
(4) Practical operation
(5)iGEM’s purpose and what to do: academic experiments, data modeling, projects show, social practice
(6)Course of iGEM
This seminar gives our members a further understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology, and promotes the exchange and learning between teams.

Teach-in:
1 IN ANHUI UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY
In view of the lack of knowledge of synthetic biology among many students, we held an intramural teach-in at the University Student Activity Center on September 18th.
 
Before the teach-in, we put up posters on campus. It attracted many students to come to inquire. We introduced iGEM to the students and it aroused the strong interest of them and the venue was packed that day.
The content is divided into three parts. First of all, we introduced the iGEM competition to the students who attended the lecture. And then we introduced the competition history of team AHUT_China and the teacher team. Finally, we focused on introducing our team and the project this year, including team work, cooperation, project background, project introduction and experimental process. We used a lot of experimental pictures to let the students have a more intuitive understanding of our experimental process, and to add a little bit of fun to the relatively boring principle. After the lecture, the team members answered questions for the students. They replied to the question of how to participate in our competition and what knowledge and skills they need to master.

TALKING ABOUT OUR PROJECT
GROUP PHOTO IN NAU
With Nanjing Agricultural University
The iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University is extremely excellent. We were honored to have visited the beautiful campus and have organized an exchange meeting with their team. We introduce ourselves and the developmental history of our school and our team, and also presented the background, inspiration source and brief introduction of our project.

To Wuwei Middle School
We talked with the leaders in the school meeting room and briefly introduced iGEM competition and its impact to them. They showed great interest in the competition and sought professional help from us. We proposed to help them in building teams and following up the project next year and to provide them with laboratory and teacher assistance.
We visited the creative classroom of Wuwei Middle School. The headmaster introduced the outstanding creations of the students and the patent awards to us, and highlighted the content of one of the students ' international awards.
We gave the lecture to the freshmen of Wuwei Middle School in their assembly hall. Before the lecture, we distributed questionnaires and played the relevant videos to the students. And then Professor Xiangrong Xu introduced what is iGEM, what is synthetic biology and our school’s projects in last few years and the outstanding projects of high School group. Our team members introduced this year's project to the students and finally, our leader introduced the American tour to the students. After the lecture, the students asked members about the details of the project. Some students asked Professor Xu for his autograph.
Email Exchanges with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
 In September, we received emails from HKUST team asking about the functionality of data visualization.
 We got in touch with them via email and recommended JavaScript and some other means to them. In response to their collaboration projects, we have chosen to communicate further with them as a result of our lack of adequate technical support.
 Finally, we have achieved the functions that HKUST needs with the cooperation of our team and other teams.

Social Media:
We think of social media as a way for more people to understand synthetic biology. We have created the WeChat public site of iGEM, and pushed articles on that. We also put the creative works of video and art creative class on the home page of the public number. We then uploaded security video on YOUTUBE. In this way, we not only promote the knowledge of synthetic biology to the public through social media, but also improve ourselves through interactions.
