The series of experiments of this project have multiple meanings, which can be divided into three aspects: film, mathematical model and practical application.
First of all, it is about the origin of inspiration——The Maze Runner. Our practice simulates Thomas's escape from the maze by means of technology, and expands the thoughts of art works from the reflection of human nature to technology application. In this case, it can be regarded as an expansion of film domain.
Secondly, it is about the mathematical problem. Our experiment is closely related to the algorithms used in graph theory, such as the Dijkstra method. At the same time , we use synthetic biology experiments to solve a classical graph theory problem ——solving feasible paths , which is a novel innovation in solving problems.
Thirdly, it is about the future application. With the development of technology , the thought in the project can be instructive to the application of navigation and other fields when the technology of bio-computer becomes more mature .In the 2014 and 2016 team project , the initial conditions are usually under given specific parameters. But actually, the situation of path condition in reality is complex and it is necessary for the system to plan accordingly in a local area .And it is in this project that we conducted a preliminary exploration.
In the experiment, we firstly use primers to build endpoints, which are similar to the starting point and end point in the map. Then, the contents of the DNA sequence are mutated by the process of error-prone PCR, which is to simulate changing conditions. The sequences need to be connected to each other in order to achieve effective detection, so we chose to pair the previous DNA using a bridge test to generate multiple double chains. After that, by using gene sequencing, namely, detecting the gene of the chain head and the chain tail, it is judged whether or not the obtained DNA is desired.
Considering that the factors in the early stage are massive, the corresponding amount of processing may be large. However, after several rounds of testing, the influence factors can be further reduced, and the efficiency of the method can be continuously improved. At the same time, although our experiments were not particularly successful because of the various reasons, we still get some results that exactly meet the Committee's standard requirements.
Part of the results that we’ve got is as follows:
