The lack of teaching materials in the field of bio-safety education in China, the obsolete of the laboratory-safe instructional videos and the disconnection between the content and the actual work of today's laboratories caused us making some educational videos. We aimed to strengthen students' bio-safety awareness and correct students’ operation which do not conform to safety standards. We hope to improve the level of bio-safety education in China and the safety awareness of people with the help of the Yale Laboratory Safety Handbook and other foreign bio-safety education materials. </H4></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-what" id="services"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="content-we"><H4>2.Timeline</H4></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-3 easy-them"><H4>September 22nd</H4><P>Shanghai University of Science and Technology and Anhui University, together with 11 other colleges and universities's iGEM team held a conference call.

Being panic, they opened the doors and windows immediately and asked the teacher for help. After the teacher handled the accident, he educated the students and mentioned what had happened before: solid reagent leakage treatment (take the case of sodium bromide leakage as an example) and the leakage treatment of ultra clean workbench medium.</H4><H4>4.

Students sat in the classroom in twos and threes and designed and exchanged ideas in the large sheet of white paper. As a result, we were impressed by their creative passion. In the lecture, we introduced ourselves and learned from each other. After that, we briefly introduced our project and the synthetic biology knowledge in order to let them learn more about it. Then we showed the logo of the Maze, which is our theme. Finally we put forward our request of designing a poster according to the maze and our project content. During the process of designing, the team members answered their questions about the content of the project. Finally the students showed us their wonderful works. We listened to their designing ideas, put forward our suggestions, and finally accepted their suggestions and took photos together. </H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-top" id="about"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="content-we"><H2>iGEM Questionnaire Survey:</H2><H3>Developed for Some Students in Wuwei Middle School</H3><H3>Before we visited Wuwei Middle School, we intended to know a little bit about their mastery of biology.

Of course, the students are not very clear about the concept of the DNA computer, so in the process of preaching, we gave them a detailed introduction about the DNA computer and the actual function.

Some of them torn off the epidermises, and some got the curl of the epidermis so that they can not be flattened on the slide. However, they never discouraged and always started again if they failed and finally succeeded. After that, we dropped a piece of red ink at one end of the slide, tilted the slide, and used the paper to absorb water at the other end to ink the onion epidermis completely. After many attempts, the children all succeeded in making an onion-slicing specimen. </H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV class="conent"><UL id="foot_list"><LI>Attribution</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Attributions">Goto</A></LI></UL><LI>Project</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Design">Pathway and Design</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/Biobrick">Biobrick</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/protocols">Protocols</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/Notebook">Notebook</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/Lab_Pictures">Lab picture</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/future_work">future work</A></LI><LI>Collaboration</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Collaborations">Goto</A></LI><LI>Human Practice</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/HP/Silver">Silver</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/HP/Gold_Integrated">Gold</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Engagement">Engagement</A></LI><LI>Description</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/Description">Goto</A></LI><LI>Demonstrate</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AHUT_China/Demonstrate">Goto</A></LI><LI>Proof</LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Http_:_//2017.igem.org/Team_:_AHUT_China/Proof">Goto</A></LI><P id="foot_copyright">Copyright 2017 © AHUT iGEM Team , All rights reserved . </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
