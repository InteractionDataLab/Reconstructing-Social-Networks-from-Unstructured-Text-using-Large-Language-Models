Video-based collaboration:
  We have filmed China's bio-safety education video with Shanghai University of Science and Technology and 11 other universities. We undertook the part of design and shooting of the eighth episode, laboratory reagent leakage treatment.
  1.Background  
  We were connected by Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The lack of teaching materials in the field of bio-safety education in China, the obsolete of the laboratory-safe instructional videos and the disconnection between the content and the actual work of today's laboratories caused us making some educational videos. We aimed to strengthen students' bio-safety awareness and correct students’ operation which do not conform to safety standards. We hope to improve the level of bio-safety education in China and the safety awareness of people with the help of the Yale Laboratory Safety Handbook and other foreign bio-safety education materials.
2.Timeline
September 22nd
Shanghai University of Science and Technology and Anhui University, together with 11 other colleges and universities's iGEM team held a conference call. During that call, we confirmed the theme, scheduled time.
September 23rd -September 26th
 
Writing scripts, confirming the actors and actress, shooting location, props, shooting time and so on.

3.Overview 
  We choose "reagent leak treatment" as the theme and narrated a story through the form of melodrama. Two students missed the teacher's teaching because they were late in experiment class. They accidentally overturned the test tube containing ether while dropping the ether. Being panic, they opened the doors and windows immediately and asked the teacher for help. After the teacher handled the accident, he educated the students and mentioned what had happened before: solid reagent leakage treatment (take the case of sodium bromide leakage as an example) and the leakage treatment of ultra clean workbench medium.
4. Results
 
We've uploaded these videos to YouTube and Bilibili, and we've got a lot of browsing and clicks. We've got compliments, criticisms and suggestions. We will humbly accept the proposal and always make efforts to improve the safety awareness of people!

Creative Classroom:
We participated in a lecture of School of Art and Design of Anhui University of Technology, which is a lecture full of art and innovation. Students sat in the classroom in twos and threes and designed and exchanged ideas in the large sheet of white paper. As a result, we were impressed by their creative passion. In the lecture, we introduced ourselves and learned from each other. After that, we briefly introduced our project and the synthetic biology knowledge in order to let them learn more about it. Then we showed the logo of the Maze, which is our theme. Finally we put forward our request of designing a poster according to the maze and our project content. During the process of designing, the team members answered their questions about the content of the project. Finally the students showed us their wonderful works. We listened to their designing ideas, put forward our suggestions, and finally accepted their suggestions and took photos together.
iGEM Questionnaire Survey:
Developed for Some Students in Wuwei Middle School
Before we visited Wuwei Middle School, we intended to know a little bit about their mastery of biology. In order to know the degree of understanding and interest of high school students, we get the following data in the form of questionnaire survey.
1. How much do you know about biology?
A I don’t know anything about it.
B I know a little bit, at least I know what it is.
C I know a lot about what it is.
D I know exactly what it has to do.
 
Conclusion: Most high school students can be seen to have some understanding of biology, including plants such as algae plants, ferns, human aspects such as human respiratory system, digestive system, as well as the ecological system, the food chain, the knowledge of nature reserves, etc.

2. If you were to design a DNA computer (A biological type of computer that encodes DNA sequences as objects and solves complex mathematical problems through molecular computation. It can be seen as a very fast computing machine), what kind of problem would you like to solve?
A Related to life
B Related to commerce
C Related to academic
D Others
 
Conclusion:
For high school students, business and academic may be a little strange, and most of them prefer to use biological knowledge to solve the problems at the aspect of life, just like what we saw in an middle school classroom, the students have a lot of for the small invention creation to solve the daily problem There are also a handful of other alternatives - political or military. Of course, the students are not very clear about the concept of the DNA computer, so in the process of preaching, we gave them a detailed introduction about the DNA computer and the actual function. We believe that they would have a better understanding of the use of DNA computers.

3. What do you think is the most important thing about PCR (polymerase chain reaction, which can be regarded as a special DNA replication in vitro) experiment?
A Temperature
B Raw material selection
C Experimental operation
D Precision of the instrument
E I don’t know
 
Conclusion:
We want to examine whether the students are aware of the core technologies used in our experiment. The students who participated in the questionnaire just learned the superficial knowledge about PCR, and we showed them the principles and operation of the PCR experiment in our project. This makes them have more intuitive understanding of knowledge, it also inspires students to our iGEM competitions.

4. If you're looking for a specific DNA sequence, which of the following is the best method?
A Screening by Gene Library
B By limiting enzyme cutting
C Find in nature
D Artificial synthesis
E Design a special primer to amplify
 
Conclusion:
Students hold different ideas on how to find out the specific DNA sequence.

5.If you were to do a synthetic biology experiment, what would be your most interesting part?
A Primer design
B PCR
C Gel electrophoresis
D Cell transformation
E Genetic engineering
 
Conclusion:
What is synthetic biology? Professor Xiangrong Xu explained and gave examples for his classmates. We are happy to see that students have such a great interest in synthetic biology. Interestingly, after the meeting, the students gathered around professor Xu and asked him about he contents of synthetic biology and asked the professor to sign on their notes.

Child's public class:
We held a child's public welfare class for children from primary schools. Brother Monkey introduced biology and knowledge of plants, animals, microorganisms, viruses and so on to the children via pictures and videos.
We introduced the structure and principle of DNA, and we worked together to make an model of it. We watched onion slices demonstration video.
We replaced of iodine with red ink. First we dropped a few drops of water on the slides, and taught the children to remove small pieces of onion from the inside of the onion skin. Some of them torn off the epidermises, and some got the curl of the epidermis so that they can not be flattened on the slide. However, they never discouraged and always started again if they failed and finally succeeded. After that, we dropped a piece of red ink at one end of the slide, tilted the slide, and used the paper to absorb water at the other end to ink the onion epidermis completely. After many attempts, the children all succeeded in making an onion-slicing specimen.
