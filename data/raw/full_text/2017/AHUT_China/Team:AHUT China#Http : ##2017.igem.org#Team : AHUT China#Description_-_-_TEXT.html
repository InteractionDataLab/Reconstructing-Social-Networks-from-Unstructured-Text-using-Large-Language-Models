This project consists of 3 parts: its inspiration, its analysis and its accomplishment.
This project was inspired by the movie, the Maze Runner. In this movie, Thomas, the hero, needs to escape from a maze, which is quite different from others. The structure of it is always changing, so the complexity is always increasing. In order to solve such a problem, we conduct a series of studies based on biological experiments.
We can see that "The Maze" could be abstracted into Graph theory algorithm in math. In other word, we need to find an available way from the start to the end. This way can be examined by math analysis or computer program or some other methods. We, however, analyze this theoretical model from the biological point of view, which is more practical.
Based on the principle of synthetic biology experiment, we obtain the changing start, end and intermediate point. Then by bridging experiment, we can get the double DNA chains which symbolize the available way. Finally, we can examine the products of the experiment to prove the correctness of the available way. In our second round experiment, we further our ideas by putting into the GFP and related parts as the signal in the pathway. Hopefully, they would increase the reliability of this system. Itâ€™s not easy to take this into a rather mature process and we just make take a trying in this round.
