In this experiment, we design the primers for the start and the end, which are similar to the promoters and terminators. We use error-prone PCR technology to increase the possibility of path, and then conduct the double chains of DNA. Finally, we select the products by gel electrophoresis. In order to improve the accuracy of the experiment, we have to repeat the each steps of the experiment again and again. By this way, we can get the samples that we need, recycle and preserve them.
There are also many factors that we need to take into consideration, such as temperature, so we list some of them out so as to make the consequences of the experiment more accurate and objective. We, however, cannot figure out all possible factors, so we put some in the Future Work part. The consequences of the experiment are shown as the Biobricks, which have been sequenced on the wiki and sent to the Registry. These are just two of the various results due to the changing conditions, but they show the effectiveness of our method and help to spread the thought of the experiment as well.
Below is a picture of the results that we get:
