Biocompass: The Maze Runner
    Hello! Welcome to get to know the project designed by one of the iGEM representatives from AHUT_China of 2017. This year we conceive a small plan in which synthetic biology will be applied to help Thomas and his friends to escape from the imprisoned mobile maze.
    We have designed a black box. There lies single-strand DNA showing the joint points and roads of the maze. Both of them will change as time files. We implemented a set of integrated experiment to help Thomas and his group to find the exit successfully in spite of facing the already changed maze.
    Not only will our project help Thomas and his friends in the future but also it will work as the server of the Internet cloud. It is used to provide people with the remote computing service of the navigation software.
