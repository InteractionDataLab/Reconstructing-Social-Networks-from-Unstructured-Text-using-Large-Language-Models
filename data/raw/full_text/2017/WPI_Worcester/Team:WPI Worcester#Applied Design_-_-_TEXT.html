The probiotic aspect of our project solves the problem of a lead pollution emergency in drinking water. The probiotic would be placed in the water before the water was consumed, and would then bind the lead in the water, making the water safe to drink. It would not be a permanent solution to the lead pollution, but it would likely be more efficient and cost effective than providing bottled water and treating lead poisoning in a large community.
