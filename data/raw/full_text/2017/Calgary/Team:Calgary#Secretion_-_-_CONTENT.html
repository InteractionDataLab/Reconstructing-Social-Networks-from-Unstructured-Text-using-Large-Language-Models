This creates a challenging problem: efficient extraction of the desired PHB from inside the cell. During the early stages of our project, we explored many possible PHB extraction methods. Before deciding on using a PHB-secretion system, we evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of each system in terms of our space application:</P><H3 align="center"><B>Secretion</B></H3><P>Secretion of PHB via the Type I hemolysin secretion pathway, which is endogenous to <I>E. coli</I> (Rahman <I>et al</I>., 2013)</P><P><B>Advantages:</B></P><P><UL><LI>No chemicals are required</LI><LI>PHB can be removed from media without killing cells</LI><LI>Secretion is automatic</LI><LI>Easier separation of PHB from media because there are minimal amounts of cellular debris</LI><LI>Continuous production process</LI></UL></P><P><B>Disadvantages:</B></P><P><UL><LI>Lower recorded yield than other methods</LI><LI>Less characterized in literature than lysis mechanisms</LI></UL></P><H3 align="center"><B>Chemical Lysis</B></H3><P>Traditionally uses solvent extraction employing chemicals such as chloroform and sodium hypochlorite (Hahn <I>et al.</I>, 1994).</P><P><B>Advantages:</B></P><P><UL><LI>Efficient yields</LI><LI>Simple</LI></UL></P><P><B>Disadvantages:</B></P><P><UL><LI>High cost of the transport of chemicals to and from Mars</LI><LI>Requires manual input of chemicals, using precious time in an astronaut's schedule</LI><LI>Lysis results in dead cells, and our system would need to be reinoculated consistently</LI><LI>Cellular debris from lysis makes separation of PHB more difficult</LI></UL></P><H3 align="center"><B>Heat-Induced Lysis</B></H3><P>T4 lysis genes (holins and endolysins) under the control of the pR Lambda promoter with thermosensitive repressor proteins cI587.

This system requires no chemical input, no replacement of bacteria, and provides continuous production that saves both time and room aboard the spacecraft, which are both precious commodities during space travel.</P><P>We decided to implement a PHB secretion system that takes advantage of the naturally-occurring Type I hemolysin system found in <I>E. coli</I>. Intracellular PHB granules are tagged with the hemolysin secretion motif, known as HlyA, and the granule is then secreted from the cell via hemolysin membrane transport proteins. This system is advantageous for our space application because it reduces extra materials and power needed, allows cells to remain intact for easier PHB separation from the liquid media, and only requires minimal bacteria replacement. The hemolysin secretion mechanism has been used previously by the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Experiments#secretion">SDU-Denmark 2016</A> and <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:Utah_State/Secretion">Utah 2009</A> iGEM teams for PHB secretion. We have used <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2018024">BBa_K2018024</A> from the SDU-Denmark 2016 as the basis for the design of our secretion complex.</P><H2>Our Secretion System</H2><H3>Type I Secretion</H3><P>PHB is secreted through the hemolysin pathway, a Type I secretion system, that is endogenous to <I>E. coli</I>. Naturally, the hemolysin toxin (HlyA) is secreted from <I>E. coli</I> as a defence mechanism. This is a single-step process that involves three additional proteins: HlyB, HlyD, and TolC. HlyB is an active transport protein that uses ATP in the cytoplasmic membrane, HlyD is a membrane fusion protein that spans the periplasm and connects the inner and outer membrane proteins, and TolC rests in the outer membrane. When HlyB recognizes the C-terminus of HlyA, it stimulates formation of the secretion channel and the toxin is secreted (Thomas <I>et al.</I>, 2014).</P><P>To use this system in our biologically engineered cells, we added the C-terminus of HlyA to the end of a phasin molecule. Phasin, coded for by <I>phaP</I>, is a small structural protein found in bacteria that naturally produce PHB. It binds to intracellular PHB, and therefore the PHB granules with bound phasin-HlyA tag are secreted as one.</P><DIV id="Caption"><B>Figure 1:</B> The hemolysin Type I secretion pathway used for PHB secretion. When the HlyA secretion tag fused to phasin is recognized by HlyB, three membrane transport proteins (HlyB, HlyD, and TolC) assemble at the plasma membrane. PHB granules with the attached phasin-HlyA fusion protein are secreted as a whole from the cell.</DIV><H3>Our Construct-<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2260002">Part: BBa_K2260002</A></H3><P>To design our Biobrick for PHB secretion, we used <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2018024">BBa_K2018024</A> from the SDU-Denmark 2016 team. This part contains a coding region for phasin (<I>phaP</I>), originally from <I>Ralstonia eutropha</I>, as well as a coding region for the HlyA secretion tag, originally from <I>E. coli</I>. Since our chassis is <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3), we codon optimized the entire sequence for <I>E. coli</I> to improve protein expression and removed restriction sites to make it compatible with all iGEM RFC assembly standards. We chose to use an IPTG-inducible T7 bacteriophage promoter to upregulate the production of Phasin-HlyA Tag because it has been observed that increased production of Phasin may decrease PHB granule size, which could increase the efficiency of PHB translocation across the cellular membrane (Maehara <I>et al.</I>, 1999).  Also, genes under the control of an inducible promoter have much higher rate of transcription than those that are constitutive. The <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) genome contains a coding region for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter, and it was therefore chosen as an ideal chassis. Furthermore, a FLAG tag (amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK) was added to the N-terminus of the Phasin-HlyA fusion protein for easier isolation of our protein during protein expression analyses.</P><P>Our BioBrick (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2260002">Part: BBa_K2260002</A>) was designed with the standard prefix and suffix so that it could be used in the pSB1C3 vector, which has chloramphenicol resistance and is the standard vector used for iGEM. </P><DIV id="Caption"><B>Figure 2: </B>Genetic construct of Phasin-HlyA Tag (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2260002"> Part: BBa_K2260002</A>). <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_B0034">BBa_B0034</A> is a common <I>E. coli</I> ribosome binding site. A FLAG tag (not visible) was also added to the N-terminus of the phasin-HlyA fusion protein (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2018024">BBa_K2018024</A>).</DIV><H2>Experiments and Results</H2><P>To quantify phasin-HlyA, we carried out two experiments: a secretion assay and SDS-Page:  </P><H3>Secretion assay</H3><P>For this experiment, the production and secretion of PHB from <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) transformed with either pSB1C3-phaCAB-phasin-HlyA Tag or pSB1C3-phaCAB (as a negative control) was measured. Triplicates in LB media + 3% glucose + chloramphenicol were incubated at 37Â°C and 150 rpm in an aerobic environment for 48 hours, then separated into secreted and intracellular fractions by differential centrifugation at 24-hour intervals. The &quot;secreted&quot; fraction contained the media that the cells were incubated in, and any PHB found in this fraction was therefore either secreted or released by lysed (dead) cells. The &quot;intracellular&quot; fraction contained all of the live cells. Before separation, CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> was added to promote aggregation and pelleting of the secreted PHB. Our method for fractionation can be found on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Experiments">Experiments</A> page and has been adapted from research conducted by Rahman <I>et. al</I> (2013). </P><P>After fractionation, the secreted fractions were treated with 1 % Triton X-100 in PBS to remove cellular debris that may have been pelleted with the secreted PHB, and the intracellular PHB portions were treated with sodium hypochlorite to extract PHB granules. Both secreted and intracellular PHB pellets were dried overnight and relative yield between the two fractions was compared. </P><P>After correcting for the mass of secreted PHB to account for the CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> that was added, the results show that at 48 hours there was a 114% increase in the amount of PHB secreted by cells that contain pSB1C3-phaCAB-Phasin-HlyA Tag compared to cells that contain pSB1C3-phaCAB only. However, there is very little difference between the two groups at 24 hours (Figure 3). Therefore it can be inferred that PHB secretion with Phasin-HlyA increased only after at least 24 hours of incubation and that Phasin-HlyA Tag was successful in increasing secretion of PHB by <I>E. coli</I>. The production of &quot;secreted&quot; PHB in control cells may not be PHB that was actually secreted, but instead it may be PHB that was released into the media as a result of cell death and lysis, which is a normal part of the <I>E. coli</I> life-cycle. More details on our experimental results can be found on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Results">Results</A> page!</P><DIV id="Caption"><B>Figure 3:</B> Experimental results of secretion assay.

There is a 40 % increase in the amount of PHB secreted by (pSB1C3-Phasin) compared to (-) after 48 hours.</DIV><H3>SDS-PAGE to identify production of Phasin-HlyA</H3><P>To confirm protein expression we carried out SDS-Page of <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag. BL21(DE3) transformed with an empty pSB1C3 vector was used as a control. Both <I>E. coli</I> were incubated to an OD<SUB>550</SUB> between 0.4-0.8 then induced with IPTG. IPTG is necessary to induce the expression of T7 RNA polymerase in BL21(DE3) so that our Phasin-HlyA-Tag could be transcribed by the T7 polymerase. The culture was then separated into soluble and insoluble fractions, as well as supernatant, which we hoped would contain the Phasin protein. Initial SDS-Page experiments (Figure 4) showed too many protein bands to be able to see a band for Phasin-HlyA Tag (27 kDa), therefore we prepared anti-FLAG resin and incubated the sample fractions with it in to separate our Phasin protein from the other proteins that were present. After incubation with the resin, the sample fraction was run on an SDS-PAGE gel, the results of which can be seen in Figure 4. All lanes of the gel appeared empty, even samples from our pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA Tag, which has an expected band size around 27 kDa.</P><DIV id="Caption"><B>Figure 4:</B> Photograph of our SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis gel run with proteins from <I>E.coli</I> BL21(DE3) transformed with pSB1C3-Phasin-HlyA tag (Phasin), <I>E.coli</I> BL21(DE3) transformed with an empty pSB1C3 vector (pSB), and a protein ladder.

All lanes are empty, indicating that the anti-FLAG resin incubation had failed. </DIV><P>Our final attempt at SDS-Page gel will use Immunoblotting. Samples from both <I>E. coli</I> variants will be prepared as described above, however, the sample fractions will be incubated with an anti-FLAG rabbit antibody instead. Then, goat anti-rabbit with IgG-HRP will be used as a secondary antibody to detect the presence of FLAG-tagged proteins by a color change. HRP changes color to blue if the secondary antibody binds to the anti-FLAG rabbit antibody bound to a FLAG-tagged protein (our Phasin-HlyA Tag). </P><H2>Future Directions</H2><P>In the future, our team would like to test the effects of other alterations on PHB secretion, such as:
