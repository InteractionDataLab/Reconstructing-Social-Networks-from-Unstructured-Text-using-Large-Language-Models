Parts
We submitted three parts to the Registry this year: two parts involved in PHB synthesis and one part involved in PHB secretion.
To meet our medal requirements, we submitted BBa_K2260001 as a new part, which uniquely contains the phaJ4 gene native to Pseudomonas putida, along with the phaC1 gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
We also improved two parts. The first, BBa_K2260000 , was an improvement on Imperial College's phaCAB operon submitted in 2013. The gene order was changed to improve PHB yield (Hiroe et al., 2012), codons were optimized for expression in Escherichia coli, and restriction sites were removed to allow part compatibility in all iGEM RFC assembly standards. The second, BBa_K2260002 , was an improvement on SDU Denmark's phasin-HlyA part submitted in 2016. Codons were optimized for expression in E. coli.
Synthesis
Biobrick: BBa_K2260000
Part type: Composite
Description: phaCBA operon with BBa_B0034 RBS
Source: Ralstonia eutropha H16
Biobrick: BBa_K2260001
Part type: Composite
Description: phaC1-J4 operon with BBa_B0034 RBS
Source: phaC1 was taken from P. aeruginosa
and phaJ4 from P. putida.
Secretion
Biobrick: BBa_K2260002
Part type: Composite
Description: Phasin-HlyA fusion protein with T7 promoter and BBa_B0034 RBS
Source: Phasin (PhaP) is from R. eutropha, HlyA tag is from E. coli, while the T7 promoter is from the T7 bacteriophage.
