SILVER MEDAL
Validate a Part
BBa_K2260001
We submitted a new gene to the registry to assist in the production of PHB: the phaJ gene that codes for PHB enoyl-CoA hydratase. This part contains both the phaJ and phaC genes and was shown to produce PHB on its own in E. coli under the control of an IPTG-inducible promoter. HPLC was used to identify and quantify the PHB produced. Results can be found on our part's Registry page.
Collaboration

Human Practices Silver
We carefully weighed the effects our project could have in a variety of applications, and considered possible benefits, challenges, and safety concerns. See our Human Practices Silver page for more info!
GOLD MEDAL
Integrated Human Practices
We continuously engaged in conversation with end-users, stakeholders, and experts in the field to inform the design and safety of our project. Find out more about our Integrated Human Practices !
Modelling
Our team worked on two types of mathematical modelling: kinetic and flux balance. You can check out the details of that on our Modelling page.
Improve a Previous Part
BBa_K2260000 and BBa_K2260002
We improved two parts. The first, BBa_K2260000 , was an improvement on Imperial College's phaCAB operon submitted in 2013. The gene order was changed to improve PHB yield (Hiroe et al., 2012), codons were optimized for expression in E. coli, and restriction sites were removed to allow part compatibility in all iGEM RFC assembly standards. The second, BBa_K2260002 , was an improvement on SDU Denmark's phasin-HlyA part submitted in 2016. Codons were optimized for expression in E. coli.
