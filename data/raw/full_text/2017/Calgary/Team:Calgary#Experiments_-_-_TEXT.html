DNA sample
Protocol
For a 1% gel (standard), add 0.3 g agarose to 30 mL TAE buffer in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and microwave until agarose is fully dissolved (avoid boiling for too long).
Allow flask to cool in fumehood until warm to the touch before adding 1.5μL RedSafe Nucleic Acid Staining Solution. Gently swirl to mix.
Pour agarose into assembled gel casting tray. Remove any bubbles with a pipette tip and place comb in gel.

DNA Excision from Low-Melting Point Agarose Gel
Experimental Details and Rationale
Fragments of DNA are separated by size on the gel, as with agarose gel electrophoresis, but DNA bands can be excised from low-melting-point agarose gel for improved ligation efficiency. With this method, specific inserts or linearized backbones can be cut out and ligated together. This decreases the chances of insert ligating back to its old backbone instead of the new backbone that we want it to be ligated to.

Allow flask to cool in fumehood until warm to the touch before adding 1.5μL RedSafe Nucleic Acid Staining Solution. Gently swirl to mix.
Pour agarose into assembled gel casting tray. Remove any bubbles with a pipette tip and place comb in gel.
Allow gel to solidify and transfer to a gel running apparatus filled with TAE buffer.
Load samples of 10 μL DNA containing 2μL loading dye.
Run gel at 80 V for 30 minutes or until loading dye is 1/2 way down the gel.
Remove the gel from casting tray and place it on a UV-light viewer. While using a UV-protecting face mask and shield, turn on the UV light and use razor blade to excise out the desired DNA bands. Try to cut the bands as quickly as possible as UV-light damages the DNA. Place each band in its own 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube
Melt the gel at 65°C for 5 minutes for ligation.

PHB Secretion
Separation of PHB into secreted and intracellular fractions
Experimental Details and Rationale
For secretion assays, a plasmid with PHB-producing and PHB-secreting genes (pSB1C3-PhaCAB-Phasin-HlyA Tag) was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and inoculated in LB with 3% glucose + chloramphenicol. After incubation for at least 24h, the samples were separated into secreted and cellular fractions for analysis of PHB secretion. CaCl2 addition causes secreted PHB to agglomerate for easier separation. This method has been adapted from Rahman et. al (2013).
Materials
50mL of PHB-producing and PHB-secreting bacterial samples that have been incubating in LB media + 3 % glucose for at least 24 hours
50-mL Falcon Tubes
1 M CaCl2
Centrifuge
Protocol
Transfer the sample to a 50-mL Falcon Tube
Add 1 M CaCl2 to the sample so that a final concentration of 0.01 M is reached.
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge at 50xg for 5 minutes. This pellet contains secreted PHB.
Remove supernatant to a new 50-mL Falcon Tube.
Centrifuge at 3270xg for 10 minutes. Discard supernatant. The pellet contains bacteria with intracellular PHB.
Purification of secreted PHB pellet
Experimental Details and Rationale
For secretion assays, PHB was separated into secreted and intracellular fractions. Intracellular PHB was purified with sodium hypochlorite (bleach extraction) and secreted PHB was purified from cellular debris with Triton X-100, which extracts lipids and proteins from the PHB.
Materials
Secreted fraction of PHB (pellet) from 50-mL of culture.
1 % Triton X-100 in PBS
Centrifuge
Protocol
Resuspend the pellet of secreted PHB in 5 mL of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifuge at 3275g for 10 minutes. Discard supernatant and let pellet dry overnight in an open tube.
NOTE:Scale reagant volumes proportionally for higher volumes of culture from which the secreted fraction was obtained. All steps should be carried out with 1/10 volume of culture.
Immunoblot of SDS-Page gels
Experimental Details and Rationale
This process is also known as a Western Blot. After running a SDS-Page gel of our Phasin-HlyA Tag, the resulting gel was incubated with FLAG antibodies because our protein contains FLAG tags. Excess antibody and proteins are washed away then a second antibody that binds to the first antibody is added. The second antibody contains horseradish peroxidase (HRP) that produces a color change when bound to the first antibody and this signals the presence of our Phasin-HlyA Tag. This protocol has been adapted from Thermo Fisher Scientific .

The goal of these experiments was to test the VFA Fermentation step of the process at lab scale and to determine the optimal operating conditions. The two different temperatures tested were 37°C and 22°C and two fermentation durations tested were 3 and 5 days. After VFA fermentation experiments, the supernatant was collected and sterilized.

Gravity driven filtration Experiement

Gravity driven sedimentation
Experimental Details and Rationale
Originally we considered using low power requirement methods for liquid (&VFA) and solid separation method. Gravity-driven sedimentation appeared to be the simplest method, hence we decided to test it's efficiency first under the Earth gravitational field. We have also examined the effect of dilution on the water recovery efficiency. /p>

Centrifugation for solid-liquid separation
Experimental Details and Rationale
Centrifugation is a power intensive method for solid-liquid separation; however, literature and industrial example show that it should be the most efficient method for solid-liquid extraction, hence we decided to compare the centrifugation liquid recovery efficiency to the efficiency of other methods. We have also tested the effect of dilution on the recovery efficiency.

Staged Pressure Filtration Experiment
Experimental Details and Rationale
Original gravity driven filtration experiments proved to recover insufficient amount of liquid  and require high degree of power when a single filter paper is used due to clogging. Therefore the staged pressure filtration experiment was developed (to test how having a series of filters decreasing in ore size would affect the required power and the amount of liquid recovered)
Materials
25g of Syn Poop
AeroPress Coffee press
Strainer
paper towel
coffee filter
11 and 0.2 micron filter paper
Protocol
Collect 25 g of Syn Feces sample. Place the strainer on top of the beaker and poor the sample into the strainer.   Record the weight of the liquid collected in the beaker
Place a paper towel filter disc into the AeroPress coffee filter device. Poor the liquid obtained in step 2 into the AeroPress.
Press on the device and collect all the liquid in the beaker. Press on the device repeatedly and make sure to shake the device every time to allow all the liquid drop to fall down. Weight the obtained liquid.
Repeat the steps 3-4 with coffee filter, 11micron filter, and 0.2micor filter
Titration Experiments
Experimental Details and Rationale
After successfully recovering liquids from the feces sample, we had to measure the VFA concentration of the sample. This was an important step for proving VFA presence in the recovered liquids, proving the increase in VFA concentration post bacterial fermentation. Wastewater treatment industry uses five-point titration method for the determination of average VFA concentration in the water. This method requires extensive calculus and long experimental procedure when simple titration have proven to work with low VFA concentrations. The following Simple titration method was developed by Anderson and Yang (1992)
Materials
beaker (100ml)
50ml Sample for titration
pH meter
Magnet stirring bar
Protocol
Place the liquid sample into the beaker
Add magnetic stirring bar to the beaker and place the beaker onto the stirring magnetic plate
Place the tip of the pH meter into the solution, make sure that the pH meter was recently collaborated  and that the tip is fully immersed into the solution
Measure the initial pH of the sample (should be above 6pH ), dilute with a base if needed
Add 1N sulphuric acid to the beaker 1ml at a time and measure the pH with every addition
Measure the volume of acid added to titrate the sample to each end point: pH of 5.1 and 3.5. Adjust the volume of each consecutive sulphuric acid addition when appropriate
Post titration calculations:
A1=[VFA]*([H2]-[H1])/([H2]+k2)
A2=[VFA]*([H3]-[H1])/([H3]+k2)
where
A1, A2 - molar equivalents of acid consumed to the first (5.1ph) and second (3.5pH) titration points
A1=(sulphuric acid concentration)(mol/ml)*(volume of acid added)(ml)
[H1]=10^(-pH)
[VFA]- VFA concentration
k1- conditional dissociation acid for carbonic acid = 3.2*10^(-7)
k2 - combined dissociation constant of the VFAs = 2.4*10^(-5)
Rearrange the equation to obtain the expressions for VFA concentration
Chemical Coagulation
Experimental Details and Rationale
One of the design options we considered for the PHB extraction used the principle of chemical coagulation. The PHB particles secreted by the E.coli were expected to be in the 20-60 nm range (Rahman et al., 2013). Therefore, we hoped to demonstrate in the lab that adding a coagulant helped the nanoparticles to agglomerate into larger particles that could be more easily recovered by centrifugation.
Materials
Lab scale centrifuge
Spectrophotometer
Probe-type Sonicator
50 ml tubes
1L of 5g/L PHB suspension in distilled water
200 ml of 1M CaCl2 solution
Protocol
The PHB suspension was sonicated in 250 ml batches in a probe-type sonicator to break up the particles in suspension.
The suspension was then allowed to settle for 48 hours before the top phase was separated by decanting.
50ml of the suspension is transferred into 50 ml tubes three different conditions are tested.
The first three samples are centrifuged at 1000 PRM
The second three samples are centrifuged at 3750 PRM
CaCl2 solution is added to the final three samples to make a final concentration of 10mM. The samples are then centrifuged at 3750 RPM.
The absorbance of each of the samples and a sample of PHB suspension after step 2 is measured at 600nm.
Electrocoagulation
Experimental Details and Rationale
We considered electrocoagulation for extracting PHB. Thus, we hoped to show that we could recover PHB from synthetic feces supernatant. PHB  particles have a zeta potential of pH 3.5 (van Hee et al., 2006), therefore in a suspension in water or supernatant (pH 5.3), we would be able to coagulate the particles by supplying positively charged ions. Therefore we planned to use an iron anode (which would release Fe 2+ ions) and a steel cathode for our experiments. We plan to test a suspension of PHB in water to see if we can settle PHB via electrocoagulation. Then we plan to go on to test just synthetic poop supernatant as a negative control and then a mixture of  PHB and synthetic poop supernatant.
Materials
9V Battery
Alligator clips
Iron nail
Steel rod
Mason jars
Lab scale centrifuge
Probe-type Sonicator
Zetasizer Nano for particle size measurements
50 ml tubes
1L of 5g/L PHB suspension in distilled water
1L of supernatant from the synthetic poop recipe
Protocol
Supernatant from the synthetic poop recipe was prepared by centrifuging samples in 50 ml tubes at 3750 RPM for 20 minutes, removing the supernatant and then centrifuging the supernatant again at 3750 RPM for 20 minutes.
The first 500 ml of the 5g/L suspension of PHB was sonicated in 250 ml batches in a probe-type sonicator to break up the particles in suspension. The suspension was then allowed to settle for 48 hours before the top phase was separated by decanting.
Average size of the particles in this sample was measured on the Zetasizer Nano and found to be in the range of 1500 nm to 1000nm. This sample was referred to as the microscale PHB.
The second 500 ml of the 5g/L suspension of PHB was first sonicated in 250 ml batches in a probe-type sonicator and then allowed to settle for 48 hours before the top phase was separated by decanting. The top phase was then sonicated again and centrifuged at 3750 RPM for 30 minutes.
Average size of the particles in the supernatant from the centrifugation step was measured on the Zetasizer Nano and found to be in the range of 70 nm to 400 nm. This sample was referred to as the nanoscale PHB.
250 ml of both the microscale and nanoscale PHB are loaded into the electrocoagulation cells. The cells are set up using an iron anode and a steel cathode similarly to the set up used in ("Make Water - Collaborative Water Purification", 2017).
The cells are run for 3 hours and the settlement is observed.
250 ml of synthetic feces supernatant was also loaded into an electrocoagulation cell which was run for 3 hours.
A 250 ml 1:1 mixture of synthetic feces supernatant and PHB suspension was then loaded into a cell and run for 3 hours.

The supernatant was then diluted using dilution factor of 32 (to get the concentration of butyric acid within the range of the HPLC) and 256 (to get the concentration of propionic acid within the range of the HPLC)
The diluted supernatant was filtered using a 0.2 micron filter into 2 ml tubes
The samples were then run on the HPLC
High Performance Liquid Chromatography Measurement of PHB
Experimental Details and Rationale
We hoped to confirm the presence of PHB within the samples extracted from the engineered E.coli by the Synthesis group using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The samples are first digested in concentrated sulphuric acid to produce crotonic acid which is measured on the HPLC.
Materials

o.2 micron filters
Lab-scale centrifuge

Protocol
We followed the protocol in (Karr et al., 1983) to convert PHB to crotonic acid.
We digested the PHB-containing samples in 1 ml concentrated sulphuric acid at 90 degrees Celsius for 30 miinutes.
After the digestion was complete we cooled the samples on ice and rapidly mixed in 4 ml of 0.014N sulphuric acid.
We diluted the samples by predicting the possible concentration of crotonic acid assuming a 80% conversion and then filtered them using a 0.2 micron filter before running them on the HPLC.
