Sterility is essential since our PHB-producing <I>E. coli</I> in the next stage of the process might be out-competed if other types of bacteria are present. The separation of solids is achieved using centrifugation, which removes large solid particles, followed by filtration, which removes remaining small particles and bacteria. </P><H2>Design options considered</H2><P> Considering the limited availability of resources on Mars including power, the initial experiments focused on mechanical and gravity-driven separation process: </P><UL><LI>Gravity-driven filtration</LI><LI>Settling </LI><LI>Pressure filtration</LI></UL><P>Laboratory experiments (see the Gravity Driven Filtration and Gravity Driven Sedimentation protocols on the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Experiments">Experiments </A> page) provided insufficient sterility and water recovery. Under 55% of the initial water was recovered for undiluted and 1:1 dilution ratio trials, though dilution did improve the water recovery efficiency. Please visit <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Results">results</A> page to find more data. The <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Experiments">Staged Filtration for Solid-Liquid Separation</A> experiment was a modification to the original experiments and provided sufficient sterility (the sample was passed through a 0.2 micron filter paper), yet insufficient water recovery - only 10% of the initial water in the sample was recovered (see <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Results">results</A> page for summary and comments). It was concluded that there exists a need for more energy-intensive methods.</P><P>More advanced solid-liquid separation techniques were then considered: </P><UL><LI>Torrefaction (mild pyrolysis)</LI><LI>Centrifugation followed by filtration </LI><LI>Screw-press dewatering system followed by multi-filtration</LI></UL><P>Initially, <B>torrefaction </B>appeared to be the best solution due to its ability to recover natural and pyrolytic (chemically bound) water, the production of sterile and VFA-rich output stream and the production of solid byproduct known as char. Char can be a used as a building material, radiation shield, and as a food supplement  (A. Serio <I>et al.</I>, 2016). However, the product stream leaving the torrefaction processing unit contains only water and VFAs, resulting in a low pH and a low amount of nutrients. We have conducted an experiment (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Experiments">PHB Synthesis using Pure VFAs as Feedstock</A>) to evaluate whether or not <I>E. coli</I> can survive in the previously mentioned conditions. The experiment showed that <I>E. coli</I> it is unable to produce PHB in the VFA-rich liquid, meaning that torrefaction cannot be used as a primary technique for solid-liquid separation.</P><P>The <B>screw-press dewatering system</B> required a large number of consumables, and had the largest mass when combined with the ESM parameters for multi-filtration (Jones <I>et al.</I>, 2016). This led to a very high ESM value which meant that despite low power consumption, the technology is not feasible for implementation on Mars.</P><P>Finally, we conducted experiments to test the liquid recovery efficiency using a <B>centrifuge</B> and found 75% liquid of initial water was recovered using the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Calgary/Experiments">Centrifugation for Solid-Liquid Separation</A> experiment. A literature search on the application of centrifugal separators showed that it would be a good match for the required task on Mars. We have further contacted the Russel Finex Company to obtain their advice on the application of their centrifugal separators to our process and received their confirmation of applicability. We have also received required ESM parameters from the Russel Finex representative.</P><P> After evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed designs and considering the ESM analysis, centrifugation followed by filtration was chosen as the preferred method for the solid-liquid separation step. In addition, the team proposes to adapt torrefaction to treat the solid byproducts after solid-liquid separation and the sludge from wastewater management on Mars to recover additional water and produce reusable char.</P><DIV id="Caption"><B>Table 1: </B> ESM analysis for different process designs for the solid/liquid separation stage of the process.</DIV><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Screw-Press Dewatering System</TH><TH>Multifiltration</TH><TH>Torrefaction</TH><TH>Centrifugation</TH></TR><TR><TD>Power (kW)</TD><TD>0.3</TD><TD>1.8</TD><TD>0.9</TD><TD>5</TD></TR><TR><TD>Weight (kg)</TD><TD>179</TD><TD>232</TD><TD>378</TD><TD>5</TD></TR><TR><TD>Volume (m^3)</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>1.8</TD><TD>3.2</TD><TD>0.014</TD></TR><TR><TD>Spares &amp; Consumables (kg/day)</TD><TD>0.0084</TD><TD>0.4</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>Spares &amp; Consumables (m^3)</TD><TD>0.01</TD><TD>0.005</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>ESM Estimation</TD><TD>1810</TD><TD>1560</TD><TD>1150</TD><TD>443</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="apa-reference"><H2>Works Cited</H2><P>A.
