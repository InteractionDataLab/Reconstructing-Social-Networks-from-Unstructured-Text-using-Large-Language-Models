Accomplishments
From January to April of 2017, our team got together for the first time over weekly meetings. As the majority of our team had no synthetic biology or iGEM experience, we spent a lot of this time learning about what synthetic biology is and how it works, as well as the infrastructure of iGEM. Over this period, our mentors (composed of some 2016 iGEM team members) held presentations to explain the parts registry, what human practices entails, Wiki requirements, and general iGEM advice. At this point, we also began looking into previous team's projects to get an idea of what is possible. A portion of this time was also dedicated to each team member acquiring research funding for the summer.
In mid-March, we decided on pursuing PHB production from E. coli to be used in wastewater systems, and the rest is history. Despite taking a large portion of April off for exams, we were able to do some literature search about our proposed methods to get a better idea of what our project will entail. In May, we began working full time, splitting our work between the lab, literature research, as well as all the other iGEM requirements such as human practices, fundraising, public engagement and Wiki design.
Over the course of the season, the team successfully designed and cloned genetic constructs into the iGEM pSB1C3 standard, characterized and submitted our parts, and successfully synthesized and secreted PHB! We sincerely thank all of the experts we consulted in the list below, as we would not have been able to inform the design of our project without their valuable feedback.

Also collaborated with our team to keep lab risk at a minimum by encouraging us to look towards alternative forms of human feces - this led us to find the NASA recipe for syn poo.
Elena Fekete, Sid Goutam, Syed Jafri, David Nguyen, Nishi Patel, Nilesh Sharma, and Dan Ziemianowicz: All members of the 2016 UCalgary team. They helped with the initial brainstorming of our project, general advice, and gave us need-to-know iGEM tutorials.

Provided contacts with professors specialized in metabolomics and flux balance analysis. Informed about the ways that the Type I secretion system could be incorporated into our model in flux balance, which could improve the model's ability to simulate lab experiments.

Dr. Ian Lewis: Assisted the team in understanding and developing the beginnings of a model for flux balance in our PHB system. Referred to postdocs in his lab who worked on flux balance analysis. The team was told about ways flux balance could be used to inform the project and to verify our pathway design for an optimal production of PHB.
Human Practices Support

Also encouraged us to look into the Baseline Values and Assumptions Document so that we are using the same parameters for our process as the researchers at NASA.
Marko Markicevic: Provided us with detailed information about the regulation and testing performed during the wastewater treatment process, as well as the VFA concentrations. This information confirmed that using wastewater as a feedstock was feasible, but not the proper application for a pure culture of genetically engineered bacteria.
Minds in Motion: Gave us the platform to speak with Grades 4-6 and 7-9 campers about synthetic biology and expose them to some fun, hands-on learning activities.
Pine Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant: After touring the plant and consulting with their employees, we realized that a synthetic biology application into existing wastewater treatment plants was not feasible. We started looking towards alternative applications after our visit.
