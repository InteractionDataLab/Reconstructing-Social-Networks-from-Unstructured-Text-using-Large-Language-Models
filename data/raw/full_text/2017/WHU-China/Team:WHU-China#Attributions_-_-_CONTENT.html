To clearly figure out what has been done by each member, we designed a novel method-a table where team members declare and take responsibility their attributions. Also, by adding names of other organizations or teachers in the Name Line and detailed attributions they’ve made in the Events Line, this table can also help to figure out the overall attributions made by all the people involved in the project. What’s more, instead of just ticking for the listed events in the table, people can also write down their significant attribution in the box by description. In the end, people who have filled out the table should sign personally to further prove its validation.</P><P>    If other teams also need to figure out each member’s attribution, we’ve simplified this table into a template as follows for the sake of their convenience.</P><P>    Name Line: Names of team members or any other organizations and teachers, who have made attribution to your project.</P><P>    Events Line: Descriptions of detailed attributions</P><P>    Box: Ticks or words are all available.</P></DIV><DIV><H1 id="Attri_others">Attribution of others</H1><H3 id="Gener">1.General Support</H3><P>    Generally, our project has gained many advice and encouragements from many people, including professors from many different schools of Wuhan University(WHU).
