Basic Parts
     Brick1 RdhANP ( BBa_K2462000 )
     This is a basic part containing the most vital enzyme of our project——RdhANP. RdhANP is a dehalogenase which can function under aerobic conditions. This feature makes it a fantastic tool to fight against organic halide in reality and we plan to give it a try in the industrial area for the management of wastewater.
     Brick3 & Brick4 Promoters for Bacillus megaterium ( BBa_K2462003 & BBa_K2462004 )
     These two promoters come from PsAsp-hp and PHIS1525, which are plasmids for the foreign protein’s expression in Bacillus megaterium. And they give other teams more choices among promoters when there’s a need for them to express a protein in Bacillus megaterium.
     Brick5 & Brick6 RBS ( BBa_K2462001 & BBa_K2462002 )
     These two RBS also come from PsAsp-hp and PHIS1525, and they allow other teams to choose different RBS according to their needs.
