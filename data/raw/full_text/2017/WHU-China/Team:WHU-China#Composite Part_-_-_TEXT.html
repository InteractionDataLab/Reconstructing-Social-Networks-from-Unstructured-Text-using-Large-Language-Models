     Brick2 RdhANP combined with a biosensor ( BBa_K2462007 )
     As we designed our project, we have wondered if there exists any regulatory mechanism to make the expression of RdhANP more precisely. We searched the information and find a biosensor created by team Peking-China in 2013. This biosensor can function when it runs into substances analogous to salicylic acid. And some of the substances they tested can serve as the substrates of RdhANP, like 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. We then linked this sensor( BBa_J61051 )made by 2013 Peking-China with RdhANP and the enzyme is supposed to express when it's substrates are available.
     Brick7 Combination of promoters in brick4 ( BBa_K2462004 ) with RBS（ BBa_B0030 ） to make ( BBa_K2462006 )
     We improve a previous part( BBa_B0030 ) by combining it with the promoter used in Bacillus megaterium. As the strength of RBS(BBa_B0030) has already been tested and the promoters of these two composite bricks are suitable for Bacillus megaterium, it’s quite convenient for other teams to use.
