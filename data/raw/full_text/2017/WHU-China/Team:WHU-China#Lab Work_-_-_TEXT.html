Safe Lab Work
1. What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab?
     a) Put on lab-gown and rubber gloves, disinfect our hands with 70% alcohol before entering the lab
     b) Treat all the chemicals, solutions and powders gently
     c) Well label all the containers, carefully discharge wastes in assigned positions
     d) Return used containers to its original positons
     e) Reckon time by timer and do experiments according to well written protocols

     h) Avoid having food or drinks around the lab
     i) Take off lab-gown and rubber gloves, disinfect our hands with 70% alcohol before leaving the lab.
2. Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues?
     All the experiments we have done are usual molecular biological experiment process that all of our team members have received sufficient training in our compulsory courses. And except for usual sequencing results, we haven’t encountered any unusual safety issues.
