Description
     This year our team has made 7 bricks in order to improve our project and expand the application fields of iGEM parts for Bacillus megaterium. Among all these parts, five of them are considered as Basic bricks (Brick 1,3,4,5,6) while others are Composite parts(Brick 2,7). Details are showed as following:

     In our project, we also try to utilize these parts to optimize the expression of RdhANP. We build different kinds of combination with various promoters and RBS. During each combnation, the expression of RdhANP will be tested. And we are aimed to figure out which of the combination gives the best effect relatively. Thus under that condition, our project will have higher feasibility in reality.
