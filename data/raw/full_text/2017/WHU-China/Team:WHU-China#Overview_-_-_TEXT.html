Overview
     In general, we aim to apply a novel dehalogenase, RdhANP, to treat industrial wastewaters by degrading the persistent and toxic pollutant, halogenated organics. To optimize its application, on the one hand, we used some conventional synthetic biological methods for reference to increase the production of functional dehalogenase. On the other hand, we planned to introduce our engineered bacterium, Bacillus megaterium into hybrid membrane bioreactor(HMBR) to make our project more practical. In this way, we'll also do some engineering work on our B. megaterium.
