1 OD600 Reference point
2 FITC fluorescence standard curve
OD600 Reference point
• Add 100 μl LUDOX into wells A1, B1, C1, D1 (or 1 mL LUDOX into cuvette)
• Add 100 μl of H2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2 (or 1 mL H2O into cuvette)
• Measure Abs600 of all samples in all standard measurement modes in instrument
• Record the data
• Import data into Excel (OD600 reference point tab) Sheet_1 provided
FITC fluorescence standard curve
#Prepare the FITC stock solution:
• Spin down FITC stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube
• Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100µM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1mL of 1xPBS.
• Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution and resulting concentration of fluorescein stock solution 50µM (500µL of 2x fluorescein in 500 µL 1x PBS will make 1 mL of 50 µM (1x) fluorescein solution.)
#Prepare the serial dilutions for fluorescein:
• Add 100 µl of PBS​ into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12
• Add 200 µl​ ​of FITC 5x stock​ solution into A1, B1, C1, D1
• Transfer 100 µl of FITC stock solution from A1 into A2.
• Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A3…
• Mix A3 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A4...
• Mix A4 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A5...
• Mix A5 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A6...
• Mix A6 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A7...
• Mix A7 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A8...
• Mix A8 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A9...
• Mix A9 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A10...
• Mix A10 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into A11...
• Mix A11 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 µl into ​liquid waste
• Repeat dilution series for rows B, C, D
• Measure fluorescence of all samples in all standard measurement modes in instrument
• Record the data
• Import data into Excel (FITC standard curve tab) Sheet_1 provided
