Where do we come from and Who are we
    Our team comes from Wuhan University(WHU), who has one of the most beautiful campuses in China. WHU has been established for over a hundred years and cultivated more than 300 thousand professional talents in various fields.
    Most of our team members come from College of Life Sciences(CLS) and the others are from School of Mathematics and Statistics(SMS), School of Resource and Environmental Sciences(SRES), School of Journalism and Communication(SJC) and School of Computer Science (SCS). Though coming from different schools, we worked together to optimize our project.
    (Some of our team members are not in the picture for some reasons.)
    As mentioned above, our team is mainly composed of students from CLS. CLS of WHU has a long history which can be dated back to 1893. The college enjoys its state-of-the-art facilities, such as the first biosafety level-3 laboratory in Chinese universities and one of the best mass spectrometry facilities in China.
    This year, we have a Primary PI, a Second PIs and two Advisors. Not only have they gave us a great many of suggestions on our project, but also have they supported us during the whole process both materially and spiritually.
