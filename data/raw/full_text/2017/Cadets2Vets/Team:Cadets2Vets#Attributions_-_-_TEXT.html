Project Advice
A big thanks goes out to our faculty advisors Drs. David Hirschberg, Matthew Lux, and Peter Emanuel.
Fundraising Support
Our team was financially supported by the Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Department of the Army, and Readiness Acceleration and Innovation Network (RAIN).
We received donations of synthetic DNA from Integrated DNA Technologies; a BioBrick Assembly Kit from New England BioLabs; and an Agilent SureVector Cloning Kit from Agilent Technologies.
We are grateful to Dr. Matt Lux, Dr. Peter Emanuel, Dr. Kristine Grace, and Dr. David Hirschberg who helped get our team members Jamboree in Boston.
Human Practices
Our team had many opportunities to engage with the public and discuss human practices. Mrs. Amanda Galuszka helped coordinate the youth outreach programs, public engagement, and logistics. We would like to thank the following people and organizations for their time in talking with us about our team's arsenic biosensor project:
RAIN
The Center for Urban Waters (especially Dr. Joel Baker)
The Charles Wright Academy (especially their Science Research class and Lower School)
Test America (Mr. Dennis Bean)
Graduate Tacoma (Kyle Roffler)
Franklin Elementary School (especially its principal Ms. Kecia Keller)
Joint Base Lewis McChord Department of Fish and Wildlife (Mr. Dennis Buckingham and interns)
Discover U (especially DJ Cristostomo, the Pre-College Coordinator at UWT for organizing the event and Stewart Middle School for attending)
Lab
Dr. Nguyen and Ryan Brisbin supervised the wet lab work by providing training, guidance, and assistance to all the team members who took part in the wet labs. Dr. John Finke from the University of Washington Tacoma allowed us to use his plate reader for the Interlab Study.
Many of the team members had the opportunity to work in the laboratory and learn how to perform experiments. These students include: Keshava Katti, Kian Croston, Brendan Studebaker, Zoey Shisler, Kristina Ilyovska, Ian Gutierrez, and Jonathan Zacarias. The dry lab work, involving Wiki coding and technological developments included Jonathan Zacarias, Josh Grace, Kian Croston, Malik Mitchell, Trevor Lowe, and Ian Gutierrez.
Project Advisors
We are grateful to our team advisors Dr. David Hirschberg, Dr. Matthew Lux, Dr. Peter Emanuel, Dr. Judy Nguyen, Mr. Ryan Brisbin, and Mrs. Amanda Galuszka who helped the team put the project together and provided the team with invaluable guidance and support.

Team Members Malik Mitchell, JoHannah Buehrer, Josh Grace, Kian Croston, Keshava Katti, Ian Gutierrez, Kristina Ilyovska, Brendan Studebaker, Zoey Shisler, Jonathan Zacarias, Mrs. Galuszka, Mr. Brisbin, and Dr. Nguyen contributed to the Wiki development by gathering information, designing, and putting together the structure of our website while consistently making improvements.
Coaching and Presentation
We would like to thank Dr. Judy Nguyen, Dr. David Hirschberg, Dr. Kristine Grace who helped the team with presentations by providing us with advice and motivating us to do our best. They made sure we set the time aside to practice our presentation before the Giant Jamboree.
Special Thanks
We are grateful to Dr. David Hirschberg who made the work on our project possible by letting us use his labs.
Special thanks to Lab Pats Carroll High School and Washington (UW Seattle) iGEM teams since they shared their Interlab data with us. We would like to thank US Naval Academy and iTesla Sound-Bio iGEM teams who we had conversations with and who helped us better understand the iGEM 2017 competition and how to be successful in it.
Dr. Kristine Grace and Amanada Galuszka provided the team invaluable administrative support and coordination.
Mr. Aron Rigg and the UW Tacoma technicians helped us find necessary equipment and reagents to use in our experiments.
We would like to express our gratitude to our partners at the University of Washington, Tacoma for all of the support they have given Cadets2Vets.
Finally, a huge thanks to the entire Cadets2Vets team for all the long hours and hard work we put in. Truly, this project would not have been possible without the support of an array of talented, dedicated individuals.
