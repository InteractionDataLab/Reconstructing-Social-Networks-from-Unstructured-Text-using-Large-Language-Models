Behind the scenes
The members of the Cadets2Vets 2017 iGEM team
KIAN CROSTON
High School Intern
Kian Croston is a Charles Wright Academy senior who plans to pursue a degree in Genetic Engineering. Kian has prior experience in biology and chemistry lab work, and hopes that this internship will give him the chance to refine his techniques and learn more about lab protocol while helping the citizens of Tacoma.
Josh Grace
High School Intern
Josh Grace is a Bellarmine Prep student. He loves computers and coding them. In addition to iGEM, he is his high school's robotics team lead programmer and team captain. He participates in iGEM because he wants to learn more about Biology and carrying out investigative scientific procedures.
​
Ian Gutierrez
High School Intern
Ian Gutierrez is a high school intern attending Stadium High School. He has a love for computers and biology, and he joined the Cadets2Vets iGEM team in the hopes that he will learn more about these disciplines.
​
KESHAVA KATTI
High School Intern
Keshava is a high school intern attending Charles Wright Academy. In preparation for the iGEM competition, he hopes to explore the fields of biology, genetics, and computer science. An engineer at heart, he seeks real-world applications of science, and is interested in biomedical engineering.
​
Angel Ortiz
High school Intern
Angel Ortiz has always had a passion for STEM subjects, and this internship is a great way to expose himself to real-life applications. He hopes to pursue a medical degree in neuroscience in college.
JONATHAN ZACARIAS
High School Intern
Jonathan is a current senior at the Charles Wright Academy with a love for the sciences and arts. With a passionate character, he seeks to apply his skill set creatively, absorb information, and learn the scientific process while on the team. He wishes to pursue bio-medical engineering in his higher education.​
CDT JoHannah Buehrer
