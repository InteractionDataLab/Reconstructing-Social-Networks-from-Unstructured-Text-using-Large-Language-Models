WEEK ONE
Date:
21 June, 2017
Experiments Performed:
Testing a circuit for biological competency within transformed E.coli.
 
Why We Performed them:
These experiments were performed to test for the presents of GFP within E. coli cells after exposure to Arsenate and arsenite.
 
 
Results:
The resulting cultures were inconclusive while consistently negative (no growth) at the 500uM  concentration across all three types. The remaining cultures after the initial concentration were 50/50 in  terms of E. coli growth. When checked for fluorescence all samples below 100uM showed possible signal  from GFP. However further analysis showed an odd mitigating variable, being that the culture media  has an auto-fluorescence within the same spectra as GFP. To prove GFP signal each culture was pelleted  out via centrifugation, washed with PBS twice and suspended to eliminate any chance of background  signal. The results showed little to no GFP signal. However due to culture variability, this will be  replicated.  Glycerol stocks have also been created of the stock circuit.
 
 
 
Moving Forward:
Due to the results above due to many mitigating factors the cell may not be biologically  competent. However, because of the variability between replicates of the varying culture concentrations  that will need to be repeated. In parallel to the replication of the culture study, a miniprep and paper  based assay will be looked at as well utilizing the Promega S30 kit.
