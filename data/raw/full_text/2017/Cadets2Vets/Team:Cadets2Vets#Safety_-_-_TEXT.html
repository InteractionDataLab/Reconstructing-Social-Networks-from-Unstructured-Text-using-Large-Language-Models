SAFETY
The experiments we have performed were done at Biosafety Level 1, meaning that the microbes we used are not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adults and present minimal potential hazard to lab researchers and the environment. Our protocols require that we wear protective equipment and make sure not to wear our clothes or hairstyle in a way that it might contaminate our work. The two elements of our experiments that required the most caution were utilizing a UV light to view our circuit's GFP fluorescence and the use of arsenic experiment preparation.
Overview
UV light exposure in our experiments comes from 3 different places:
The gel imager that we used to take pictures of our DNA gels and paper tickets.
The handheld UV lamp we used to preview the results of our tickets before imaging.
The UV LEDs that we used in our imaging chamber with the VK3 camera.
​To combat these issues:
The gel imager was enclosed in a box with internal imaging capabilities to avoid exposure to UV light. We also had an orange filter that was used to protect our eyes if we wanted to look at the gel directly.
The handheld UV lamp was not enclosed in a box, so we wore a protective face mask when using it. We also made sure to point the lamp away from ourselves and our skin.
The UV LEDs in the VK3 camera were assembled inside a box to limit the exposure it had on our skin. This means turning off the LEDs when we were working on the assembly and making sure the box was closed when we tested the imaging design.
We understand the dangers of arsenic, so we always wore gloves when weighing out the chemicals and handling the arsenic solution. Any waste product or used tickets were placed in a container and disposed of through the environmental health chemical waste disposal program.
Lab Practices
Practice #1
• Individuals must wash their hands: (a) after working with potentially hazardous materials, recombinant materials and animals; (b) after removing gloves; and (c) before leaving the laboratory.
Practice #2
• Eating, drinking, smoking, handling contact lenses and applying cosmetics are not permitted in laboratory areas.
Practice #3
• Mouth pipetting is prohibited; mechanical pipetting devices must be used.
Practice #4
• All procedures should be performed in such a way that minimizes splashes and/or aerosols.
Practice #5
• Work can be performed on an open lab bench or table.
Practice #6
• Decontaminate all work surfaces with appropriate disinfectant after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious or viable recombinant material. Suitable disinfectants include: 10% bleach solution, 70% ethanol solution or 2% wescodyne solution.
Practice #7
• Using an effective method, decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious or recombinant materials before disposal.
Practice #8
• Anyone working in the lab needs to wear closed toe shoes, clothing covering down to at least the knee, and proper protective equipment as needed.
