Specificity of arsr regulatory protein
The Cadets2Vets team met with a local entreprenuer and industrial chemist named Josh Haney to better develop the arsenic-sensing circuit. Questions Mr. Haney had regarding the specificity of our regulatory protein led the team to research the specificity of ArsR. The team discovered that the ArsR protein is highly specific to arsenic and antimony, and included a supplementary paper in their research that characterizes ArsR.
