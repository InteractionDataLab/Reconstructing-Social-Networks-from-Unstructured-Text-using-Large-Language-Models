Notes:
Based off of the recommendations from previous report, it was determined that the two primary needs were to identify a means of quantifying GFP production, and QC/QA the plasmid.
Proposed route:
Attempt to see if LC 480 II is capable of monitoring GFP production
QC/QA Plasmid:
Plasmid Gel
M13 amplification
Attempt to quantify the culture, at 25 ÂµM of arsenite and arsenate
Experiments:
Validate the use of LC 480 II utilizing T7 constitutive GFP construct
Experiment was run in triplicate with both
Controls: T7 expression blank, Solution blank (water), and Plasmid blank
QC/QA of Ars 1.1 plasmid circuit
Minipreps were done in triplicate and tested on the nanodrop
The triplicate minipreps were run on three separate gels at 0.7% agarose
All three mini-preps were tested with an M13 cloning site amplification and the insert size was checked on a 1% agarose gel
Culture of Ars 1.1 transformed E. coli were exposed to 25uM Arsenate+Arsenite at 37C in the LC 480 II for 24 hours
Percentages are in m/V
LB 4%
Ampicillin 0.01%
Results:
Validate the use of LC 480 II utilizing T7 constitutive GFP construct- Successful
The LC 480 II was successfully able to monitor the increase of GFP over the incubation time.
QC/QA the Plasmid:
Circularized plasmid gels proved inconclusive, however M13 amplification did provide strong indication of the proper fragment. The fragment size is 1461 bp, with the second bright band in the ladder being equal to 1650 bp. All minipreps exhibit a band slightly below the 1625 bp band of the ladder, which is evident of the proper fragment size.
IMAGE GALLERY
The lightcycler graphed the normalized fluorescence of various controls.
This is the ticket we ran. The first column is fluorescing, and the other columns are not.
During the initial test of the circuit in the presence of 25 um arsenite and arsenate solution, we were able to generate a fluorescent signal using the Light Cycler.
