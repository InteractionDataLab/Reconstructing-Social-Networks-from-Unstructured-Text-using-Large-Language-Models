EDUCATING AND ENRICHING
Science Breakfasts
CADETS2VETS participates in an interactive forum where faculty, students, and science-minded community members interact over breakfast to discuss topics in science. Current innovations, trends, and concepts are discussed by the group each week in this popular event held at RAIN on Saturday mornings. Our iGEM team used this event to engage with the community during this event, incorporating innovative ideas.
Superheroes of science
This Spotlight Event hosted by CADETS2VETS invites a visiting expert to RAIN for a lecture to faculty, students, and the general public. This popular lecture is a highlight of the organization and spun out of UWT. The team is proud to host and promote “a life and career in the pursuit of science,” and use this event to engage the community in the field of synthetic biology.

Urban Waters Presentation (09/15/2017)
The iGEM team joined a cohort of undergraduate students in presenting research done over the summer at the Center for Urban Waters. Cadets2Vets shared what iGEM is, as well as the arsenic sensor we have been working on. Experts and undergraduates at Urban Waters asked questions about the team's project, providing valuable feedback for the team.
Urban Waters Presentation (09/15/2017)
Cadets2Vets gave a lecture on the significance of arsenic and the work we have performed to develop a new test. This lecture promoted the strengths of synthetic biology and the power it had to lead to new technologies. This was different from other presentations where many of the research projects surveyed environmental problems, but mostly researched them doing meta-analysis or using more traditional ways of identification.
Science Research outreach (09/20/2017)
The Cadets2Vets team gave local high school students a tour of the community lab and explained to them the work being done for the iGEM 2017 competition, and how they could become engaged in synthetic biology and science in general.
RAIN Incubator Grand Opening and fundraising nights (09/29/2017 and 07/27/2017)
At RAIN Incubator's Grand Opening and Fundraising Nights, the Cadets2Vets team had poster presentations about our iGEM arsenic biosensor. Over the course of the evenings, around 400 people visited, many of whom posed questions to the iGEM team during presentations. Photo credit: Jeff Caven
Charles Wright Academy Lower School Outreach (10/11/2017)
CADETS2VETS presented to multiple 1st - 5th grade classes on the problem with pollutants in our environment, especially arsenic due to the ASARCO plant in Ruston, WA. Simple tools were introduced to understand pH testing, fluorescence, and measurements. These were interactive lessons with students engaging with our team in a learning environment.

Discover U with Stewart Middle School (10/11/2017)
After given an introduction to luminescence, the children were taken through our 4 labs with an activity set up in each. The kids had a chance to look at fluorescent water beads and tonic water, the light that is emitted from crushing life savers, the fluorescence given off of GFP-producing bacteria, and glow stick paintings! The kids thoroughly enjoyed their time with our team and were given their own small UV LED flashlights to go home and find luminescent objects with.
Our team learned a lot from interacting with the students at Stewart Middle School. We learned that it is easy for kids to understand complex topics if the ideas are presented in a bite-sized way. We also learned that it is easy for kids to enjoy science if you make it fun. We set out
to just have fun and learn with the kids so the event turned out well.​
Discover U with Stewart Elementary School (10/11/2017)
55 students from Stewart Middle School in Tacoma, WA were invited to take a DiscoverU-hosted field trip to see our labs and learn about the science of luminescence and the ways that
science and technology are inspired by nature and our project.
The Cadets2Vets team talked to the kids about different types of luminescence, where you can find it and its uses in nature. The history of the copper smelting plant that contaminated Tacoma’s water and soils was surprising for the kids, and many had not heard of the ASARCO plant. Some of the children thought it was cool that arsenic and other chemicals can be detected using something that glows (GFP). Photo credit: Ingrid Barrnetine
Steam night with Graduate Tacoma At Franklin Elementary School (10/17/2017)
In an effort to provide more awareness and access to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) learning opportunities, the Cadets2Vets team partnered with Graduate Tacoma, a local non-profit, to host a fun and interactive family science event. Students were each given their own UV LED flashlight and a glow stick bracelet as they entered. While families ate the provided food, our team explained that we are working on a project for the iGEM competition. We talked about synthetic biology and explained how we have engineered an arsenic test using an arsenic regulating protein and a glowing fluorescent protein, comparing our test to those used in hot tubs to test chemicals. A history of the ASARCO plant was given, as well as some information about the health risks of arsenic and why it is important to test for it.​
Steam night with Graduate Tacoma At Franklin Elementary School (10/17/2017)
Information was given about bioluminescent jellyfish and how their GFP has been used as a marker for various kinds of tests. We spoke briefly about how DNA codes for these proteins and that genes, sections of DNA, can be moved into the cells of other organisms. We went on to outline different kinds of bioluminescence and how these “creature powers” could inspire new approaches to bioengineering.
Steam night with Graduate Tacoma At Franklin Elementary School (10/17/2017)
Families were then instructed on the different STEAM stations that were provided. Since the ages of students varied from four to ten years-old, we provided a wide range of activities. Some were as simple as coloring a diagram of bioluminescent organisms and constructing a jellyfish craft, while other activities had students building models of DNA and painting with glowing chemicals. We were also lucky to partner with a self-proclaimed microbial supremacist, a professor at the University of Puget Sound, who brought in his amazing bioluminescent bacteria artwork to share with families and talk more about the potential research opportunities with these amazing microorganisms.
Overall, the night was a hit with excited kids and happy parents who were impressed with the fun and learning that was had by all.
