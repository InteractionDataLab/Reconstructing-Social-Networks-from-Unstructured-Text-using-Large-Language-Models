Attributions
We are proud to say that all the ideas we worked on this year were proposed by undergraduate members of iGEM 2017 team TokyoTech. We also want to thank all those advisors and instructors who helped us discuss these ideas and guided us through doing the experiments. The whole experimental data produced by our team comes from experiments all carried out by undergraduates.
The project "Coli Sapiens" was proposed by Hazuki Hasegawa and Hajime Fujita.
