Experiment: Overview
Introduction
For convenience of description, we devided experimental section into two parts. One is a series of assays to validate signal transmission system from bacteria to human cells. The other is a assay (AHK4 Assay) to validate the reverse system from human cells to bacteria. You can see the list of assays we conducted and also, a summary of InterLab activity.
Signal transmission system from bacteria to human cells
~ Integration of systems derived from bacteria and human cells ~
In our system, the transcription level is controlled by integrating quorum sensing (bacterial cell-to-cell communication) and NF-kB, transcription factor in mammalian cell. We used this system the signal transmission from bacteria to human cells. To validate the system, we conducted the assays shown below.

Signal transmission system from human cells to bacteria
~ Integration of systems derived from bacteria and plant cells ~
In our system, the transcription level is controlled by integrating signal transmission systems derived from bacteria and plants. We used this system the signal transmission from human cells to bacteria.

InterLab
In iGEM 2017, the InterLab Study is one of the bronze medal criteria. We measured the GFP expression level of the six designated devices, positive control and negative control using the plate reader. It was the second time for our team to join this InterLab Study (The first time in iGEM 2015).
