Coli Sapiens
We plan to establish an artificial co-culture system of human cells with bacteria (E. coli) by integration of quorum sensing (cell-to-cell communication between bacteria), His-Asp phosphorelay and cytokinin (a signaling molecule in plant) in this co-existing system
PROJECTt
PROJECT
we try to establish a new living system that human cells control the population of bacteria by engineering the both cells by creating two signaling pathways of 1) Bacteria-Mammals and 2) Bacteria-Plants. We expect that this system will lead to a new experimental approach and a new medical therapy.
