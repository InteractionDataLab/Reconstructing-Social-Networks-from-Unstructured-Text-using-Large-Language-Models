Team Introduction
Our team, iGEM 2017 Team TokyoTech consists of 12 undergrad students. At an early stage of our project, our team got together, trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. Since then, we encouraged each other, worked together, and overcome difficulties. Now, we are ready to show our achievement.
