1. Technical collaboration with Team IONIS-Paris
We met up with Nicolas, a member of Team IONIS-Paris at TokyoTech in July. In the meetup, he gave us a presentation about the project. In the presentation, it turned out that they need a temperture-selective promoter which we used last year, so we decided to offer them a Biobrick part (BBa_K1949001: Pcold-gfp).
Instead of offering a BioBrick part, they, Team IONIS-Paris gave us advice about modelling. In particular, we wanted to know folding speeds of proteins that appear in our project. The modelling section in Team IONIS-Paris is familiar with PHYRE2 (Protein Fold Recognition Server), and they calculated all the folding speeds on it and gave us the results. The consultation was really helpful for us to predict the production rate of target protein and drew on the advice when we set parameters in our model.

2. Mentoring Team ASIJ Tokyo
Our team mentored Team ASIJ Tokyo when we met up on September 23rd. Team ASIJ Tokyo is a very young team and it's the second time to participate in iGEM competition. Most of the team members are not familiar with scientific research and iGEM culture, so we gave them advice about the modeling of the data and the improvement of their qualitative analysis, as well as guidance for how to best represent their project motivations and research.

3. Meetup (Practice Session) at Boston University
On November 8th, 2017, our team hosts a meetup in Boston University. We are looking forward to sharing ideas with other iGEM teams. Each team will have the opportunity to present their projects and exchange their ideas in detail with other iGEM teams and faculty advisors right before the Giant Jamboree.
