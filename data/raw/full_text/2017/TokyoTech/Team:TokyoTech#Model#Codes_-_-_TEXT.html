Modelling: Codes
Introduction
In our previous projects, we've long used MATLAB for the calculation and visualization. However, MATLAB is not widely used. We thought that we can contribute more to iGEM community using more popular programming languages.
In this year's project, we chose Python. Python is one of the most popular languages all over the world and it's convenient for us to import external functions and codes. We uploaded the codes on Github, so you can see the process of the calculation and visualization.
We think these codes would be applicable for other iGEM projects and we hope in the future, we'll help other iGEM teams that need assistance with modelling.
