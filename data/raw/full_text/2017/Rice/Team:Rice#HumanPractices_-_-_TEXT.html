HUMAN PRACTICES
General Overview
Although hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) contamination is a concern in our Houston community, we did not know much about the issue when we first embarked on this project. Too learn more, we spoke with policy researchers and water treatment experts. These conversations shaped the design of our bioremediation solution and also led to us writing a policy proposal for the Houston City Council. We met with students young and old as we sought to raise awareness about Cr(VI) contamination.
It is particularly important for us to address the significant concerns that arise regarding the ethicality and safety of synthetic biology because implementation of our solution would require the public to have confidence in genetically engineered bacteria. Through human practices, our team sought to educate and to challenge the conventional attitudes of people toward synthetic biology.
