Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Our project has been documented on our wiki and we look forward to presenting our team poster and presentation at the Giant Jamboree. Our safety and judging forms have been submitted. Our parts pages are completed and we submitted a sample to the registry.
Please refer to our attributions , where we list the contributions of those who have made Rice iGEM possible.
This cycle, we participated in the Interlab Measurement Study. Check out our results!

We submitted and characterized a chromate reductase enzyme .
We both contributed to and benefited from collaborations with local and international iGEM teams!
After conducting exploratory research on chromium contamination and water treatment, we led a number of outreach and engagement initiatives focused on educating our campus and local communities.

Integrated Human Practices
Model your project
Our work in wet lab, modeling, and community engagement culminated in a policy proposal that advocates for reassessment of current Cr(VI) regulations and promotes the implementation of our engineered microbe.
We developed a model of a wastewater treatment process to see how our engineered bacterial system would perform in a real-world application.
