Valencia UPV
We participated in the Valencia UPV iGEM teamâ€™s research on the status of transgenic regulation, consumption, and perception in various countries. The opportunity to reflect on how genetic engineering affects our day-to-day lives beyond the research lab was interesting. We also asked our peers about their perceptions of genetically engineered products to have a more representative sample of US consumers than just iGEM team members. The variety of reactions we heard ranged from ambivalent to strongly negative. This was an important reminder of how the importance of projects like our human practices outreach and engagement initiatives.
We also collaborated with Valencia UPV to produce two Humans of SynBio posts.
University of Texas and Texas Tech
We had a Texas iGEM teams' meet-up at the 2017 UT Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium. We had the opportunity to practice our Giant Jamboree presentations and exchange valuable feedback. This is the second year in a row that all of the Texas iGEM university teams have gathered in the fall before the Jamboree, establishing a valuable statewide peer network.
University of Texas
We collaborated with the University of Texas's less experienced modeling team to provide guidance in creating graphics, to discuss ways to improve modeling mechanisms, and also to answer questions about using SimBiology.
William and Mary
We collaborated with the College of William and Mary iGEM team to produce a Humans of SynBio post.
