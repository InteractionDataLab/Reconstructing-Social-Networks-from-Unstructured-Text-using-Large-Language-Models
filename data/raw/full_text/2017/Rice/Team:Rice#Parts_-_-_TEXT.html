Description
BBa_K2194000
chrR6 Chromate Reductase Enzyme
basic
The chrR6 protein is a mutated/enhanced version (Tyr128Asn) of the chrR enzyme originally found in Escherichia coli. It has chromate and uranyl reductase activity. BioBrick BBa_K2194000 contains only the cds for this protein.
BBa_K2194002
PgntK Negative Feedback Membrane Stress Promoter
basic
The PgntK promoter is a native Escherichia coli negative feedback membrane stress promoter. BioBrick BBa_K2194002 contains the 200 bp upstream of the gntK gene in Escherichia coli, which has been previously experimentally shown to incorporate the full Pgntk promoter region.
BBa_K2194001
Sulfate Binding Protein (sbp) cds
basic
The sbp protein is found inEscherichia coli and specifically binds sulfate and related species (like chromate and selenate) for their transmembrane transport via the ABC transporter system encoded by the cysPUWA genes. BioBrick BBa_K2194001 contains only the cds for this protein.
BBa_K2194003
cysPUWA Sulfate Transport System cds
composite
The cysPUWA genes encode the sulfate ABC membrane transporter in Escherichia coli. This system also transports related species such as chromate. BioBrick BBa_K2194003 contains the cds for cysP, cysU, cysW, and cysA in the context in which they appear in E. coli MG1655.
BBa_K2194004
Sulfate Transport System w/ Negative Feedback for Membrane Stress
composite
This transcriptional unit codes for the genetic parts necessary to bind and transport chromate, sulfate, and related species across the cell membrane. BioBrick BBa_K2194004 is a composite part composed of negative feedback membrane stress promoter PgntK ( BBa_K2194002 ), a synthetic RBS, cysPUWA proteins ( BBa_K2194003 ), Elowitz RBS ( BBa_B0034 ), sulfate binding protein sbp ( BBa_K2194001 ), and a synthetic terminator.
BBa_K2194005
chrR6 Chromate Reductase Enzyme with Chromate-sensitive Promoter
composite
This transcriptional unit codes for a chromate reductase enzyme under a chromate-sensitive promoter. BioBrick BBa_K2194005 is a composite part composed of Pchr chromate-sensitive promoter ("cr-promoter" feature of BBa_K1758312 ), with rbs ( BBa_K1758100 ), and chrR6 chromate reductase ( BBa_K2194000 ).
