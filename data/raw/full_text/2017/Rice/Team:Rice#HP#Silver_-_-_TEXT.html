HUMAN PRACTICES SILVER
Over the course of this project, we discovered that not many people know about or have even heard of Cr(VI). A major objective of our project addressed this gap in public knowledge. A secondary objective was to educate the public and decrease stigma about genetic engineering. First, we learned more about Cr(VI) ourselves by visiting the Baker Institute for Public Policy to interview experts about Cr(VI). We also researched about current methods for measuring Cr(VI) levels in the environment and tested one method of detecting Cr(VI) in solution using diphenylcarbazide. Next, we transmitted information about Cr(VI) through as many means as possible. We hosted an annual bioethical debate for high school girls interested in STEM to instill excitement about synthetic biology. At events such as a summer research panel and regional research symposium and in synthetic biology-related classes, we shared information about Cr(VI), our project, and iGEM in general. We placed posters across our campus and screened the film “Erin Brockovich” to raise awareness about Cr(VI) on our own campus.
