Background
The Quorum sensing system of Staphylococcus aureus
S. aureus employs diverse array of virulence factors, involving a large number of cell-surface bound proteins (e.g. adhesins, fibrinogen/fibronectinbinding proteins) that are expressed during colonization of the host, and secreted proteins (e.g. haemolysins, proteases, lipases) that are required for acute infections. In S. aureus, expression of virulence factors is tightly controlled by an auto-inducing quorum-sensing system known as the accessory gene regulator (Agr) system. The agrD gene encodes the signaling propeptide. The agrB gene encodes the peptidase for processing of the signaling propeptide. Together with the protease SpsB, the AgrD will be matured and cyclized by formation of the cyclic thiolactone bond between an internal cysteine and the C-terminus residue. The AgrD mature peptide is the signaling peptide of the Agr system, which is also usually called the auto-inducing peptide (AIP) molecules. The AgrC and AgrA constitute a two-component system. The AgrC protein is the receptor for AIP. After bound by the AIP, the AgrC will dimerize and phosphorylate each other to activate the AgrC protein. The AgrC can phosphorylate the AgrA protein. Phosphorylated AgrA protein will dimerize and bind to the P2 promoter of the agrBDCA operon, thus forming a positive feedback loop. The active AgrA dimer will also bind to the P3 promoter to activate the expression of a non-coding RNA, the RNA Ⅲ. The RNA Ⅲ can influence the translation process of virulence factors and adhesion factors. The deletion of Agr system usually attenuates S. aureus virulence in animal models.
Fig1. The Agr system of S. aureus
A polymorphism in the amino acid sequence of the auto-inducing peptide (AIP) and of its corresponding receptor (AgrC) divides S. aureus strains into four major groups, agr-I, agr-II, agr-III, and agr-IV. There are cross-talks between these four types of Agr system. It is hypothesized that the divergence of Agr system might influence different lineages of S. aureus to occupy different niches.

The probiotic Lactococcus lactis
L. lactis is one of the best characterized lactic acid bacteria with detailed knowledge on genetics, metabolism, and biodiversity. L. lactis is of crucial importance for manufacturing dairy products, such as buttermilk and cheese. L. lactis has once been named the official state microbe of Wisconsin, the No. 1 cheese-producing state in the United States. In addition to its traditional use in food fermentations, L. lactis is increasingly being used in modern biotechnological applications, including cancer, diabetes, vaccination, infection protection and animal diseases. L. lactis has also become famous as the first genetically modified organism to be used alive for the treatment of human disease (Recombinant L. lactisL. lactis secreting IL-10 for the treatment of Crohn disease, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729872).
The RRNPP family
In addition to be sensed by the receptor histiding kinase of two component system, the peptide can be actively imported back into bacteria by the oligopeptide transporter Opp, at which point they interact with sensors in the cytoplasm. These sensors belong to the RRNPP family of cytoplasmic regulatory receptors. The RRNPP family is named for the prototypical members, Rap, Rgg, NprR, PlcR, and PrgX. The RRNPP members that have been studied are found in bacilli, streptococci, or enterococci. The C-terminal regions of the RRNPP proteins adopt a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain-like conformation which binds the signaling peptides. The signaling peptides are linear and exhibit mature lengths between 5 and 10 amino acids. With roles in virulence, natural competence, sporulation, biofilm formation, and other activities, RRNPP signaling pathways stand as attractive targets for treatments aimed at manipulating bacterial behaviors.

The AimR-AimP system of Bacillus subtilis bactriophage phi3T
The bacteriophage can also employ the RRNPP family proteins to make the lysis-lysogeny decision. In a paper published on Nature in 2017, the authors found the B.subtilis bacteriophage phi3T encode the Aim system to make lysis-lysogeny decision. The AimR is a transcription factor, the AimP is the propeptide of the mature signal peptide. Binding of AimP to the AimR will disrupt the dimer forms of AimR. After that, the AimR can no longer bind to the promoter of AimX, a potential non coding RNA involved in the process of lysis-lysogeny. A superb characteristic of the Aim system is that the AimR only bind to the promoter of the AimX gene. The ChIP-seq data revealed that there is only one binding site of the AimR in the whole hpi3T genome. This data indicate that the specificity of the Aim system is very high, which is the required characteristic for the synthetic QS system.

The PlcR-PapR system of B.cereus
B.cereus cause acute diarrheal disease by the production and secretion of a variety of hemolysins, phospholipases, and toxins. The production of virulence factors is controlled by the PlcR-PapR QS system. PapR is 48 amino acids long and contains an N-terminal signal peptide that targets it for secretion. Outside the cell, the PapR pro-AIP is processed by the secreted neutral protease B (NprB) to form the active AIP. The mature PapR oligopeptide sequence is ADVPFEL. The processed PapR AIP is imported back into the cell by the oligopeptide permease system (Opp). The PlcR protein has two domains. The helix-turn-helix domain is involved in the DNA binding activity. The TPR domain is involved in signal peptide binding. Inside the cell, PapR binds to the transcription factor PlcR, and this causes conformational changes in the DNA-binding domain of PlcR, facilitates PlcR oligomerization, DNA binding, and regulation of transcription.

Introduction of B.cereus
As a model organism, B.subtilis is commonly used in laboratory studies directed at discovering the fundamental properties and characteristics of Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria. Due to its excellent fermentation properties, with high product yields (20 to 25 gram per litre) it is used to produce various enzymes, such as amylase and proteases. Other enzymes produced by B. subtilis are widely used as additives in laundry detergents. It is also used to produce hyaluronic acid, which is used in the joint-care sector in healthcare and cosmetics. B.subtilis is the most widely used Gram positive bacteria chassis in synthetic biology. It has its own QS systems. However, to avoid interfering its physiology, synthetic communication systems is needed for this important chassis.
