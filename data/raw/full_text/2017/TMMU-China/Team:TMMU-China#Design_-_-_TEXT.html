By combining the expression of AimR and AimP components, we want to develop a synthetic QS system in B.subtilis for target gene autoinhibition. A synthetic communication pathway between B.subtilis strains by co-culturing AimP-producing “sender” cells with AimR-sensing “receiver” cells to inhibit gene expression will also be constructed. To develop a synthetic QS system in B.subtilis for target gene autoinduction, we are going to combine the expression of PlcR and PapR components. Furthermore, we will develop a synthetic communication pathway between B.subtiliss strains by co-culturing PapR-producing “sender” cells with PlcR-sensing “receiver” cells to induce gene expression. These new tools will be vital for controlling gene expression in this industrially important Gram positive host, and may lead to the expanded use of B.subtilis in laboratory and industrial settings.

To engineer the Agr system for L. lactis, we want to develop a synthetic autoinduction system for L. lactis. Synthetic autoinduction systems have proven very effective for producing high yields of heterologous protein in high cell density cultures. Autoinduction systems can often express higher titers of recombinant protein than more traditional inducible systems, with the added advantage that there is no need to monitor cell growth and add exogenous molecules at a specific cell density. These systems can be particularly useful for high-throughput screening of many cultures in parallel where monitoring cell growth can be a significant burden, and also for industrial applications to provide reliable induction and increased productivity. L. lactis is widely used in recombinant protein production. Such an autoinduction system is very useful for L. lactis. We placed the agrBDCA operon under the constitutive promoter P32 that is widely used in L. lactis. To moniter the autoinduction, we placed the reporter gene GFP under the control of promoter P2. All these elements were cloned into the shuttle vector of L. lactis, pMG36ek.
The Agr system can be split between cells to engineer synthetic cell-cell communication systems. In this design, the Agr system is split into AIP sender part and AIP receiver part. In the Sender cell, the agrB and agrD gene is under the control of the P32 promoter. In the Receiver cell, the agrC and agrA gene is under the control of the P32 promoter together with the reporter module, the P2-GFP composite part. All these elements were cloned into the shuttle vector pMG36ek.
