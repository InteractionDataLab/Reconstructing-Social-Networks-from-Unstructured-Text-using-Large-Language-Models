1.SCU-WestChina
a.iSWU 2017
We attended the China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU) this year and have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms.
When attending to SCU-WestChina, we suggested that they could change the microbial chassis of their dialysis part from Salmonella Typhimurium to Bacillus Subtilis to better ensure safety. And we are glad it helped.
b.Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
Together with SCU-WestChina, SCU-China and UESTC-China, we held the exhibition themed ”GMO & Human Health” in Chengdu Library.
c.Plasmid delivery
We offered some genes from 2016 iGEM Distribution Kit to SCU-WestChina when they turned to us, and it’s our pleasure to help.
2.SCU-China
a.iSWU 2017
When attending China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU), SCU-China shared their 3 alternative projects, one of which is about oral vaccine of rabies. Our professor suggested that such immunology experiments are extremely time-consuming and the results of such experiments usually are non-predictable, which may be exceedingly hard to finish the project of oral vaccine rabies in no more than 3 months. They finally picked up the project Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli, and hope they can make a great job on it.
b.Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
Together with SCU-WestChina, SCU-China and UESTC-China, we held the exhibition themed ”GMO & Human Health” in Chengdu Library.
3.XJTLU-China
This year, we aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria--Staphylococcus aureus. However, we had difficulties synthesizing the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids, and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, XJTLU-China had the similar construction and provided us with their group I Staphylococcus aureus’s agrC and agrA genes.
