1.The development of International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition in China the latest decade
Synthetic biology is a fast moving interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering. To educate the next generation of synthetic biology scientists, the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition was established. In the past ten years, many Chinese teams have participated in this event, but no thorough review and analysis have been carried out. We collect a lot of the Chinese teams’ data and information from the iGEM website and analyzed the number of teams, the performance of these teams. From these analysis, we envision the iGEM competition will continue to promote the innovative education in China, especially for those undeveloped areas.
The number of Chinese teams in iGEM competition
In Figure 1, we catalogued the number of teams from the globe or from China. From the iGEM website data, we take the teams at the “Accepted” status as the officially teams participated in the iGEM competition. In 2007, there were 5 teams from China. They were Tianjing, USTC, Peking, Tsinghua and Taipei. But in 2016, there were 73 teams from China, which surpassed all the other countries in the iGEM competition. We also calculate the ratio of Chinese teams among all the teams, and we found that the ratio increased from 9.6 % (2007) to 26.8% (2016). It took 6 years to increase from 9.6% (2013) to 22% (2013), while it took 3 years to increase from 22% (2013) to 26.8% (2016).
Figure 1a The number of teams from the globe or China and the ratio of Chinese teams
We also sum up all the times that all the teams participated in iGEM competition, and we found that in the past 10 years, there were 303 teams from university or institution participated in the iGEM competition all together. We also place their numbers in different provinces, direct-controlled municipalities and special administrative districts. We found that most of the teams were still from the developed areas, indicating that the these teams participated early in the iGEM competition, and some universities had 2 or 3 teams in some years, further make the distribution of teams biased in the developed areas.

The performance of Chinese teams in the medals
The gold, silver or bronze medals are awarded based on the quality of the project. All teams can achieve any one of these medals. After analyzed the increased number of Chinese teams in iGEM, we want to know the performance of Chinese teams in iGEM. We retrieved the medals data from the iGEM website. We found that the performance of Chinese teams is extraordinary, especially in the undergraduates group.
The total medals, especially the gold medals increased from 2007 to 2016 among Chinese iGEM teams. In 2007, the 5 teams got 5 gold medals, but in 2008, no gold metals. In 2016, there were 37 gold medals among Chinese teams, which indicated that the Chinese teams performed very well in the iGEM. To further get a glimpse into the performance of Chinese teams in iGEM, we analyzed the ratio of gold, silver, bronze and no medals among Chinese teams. We found that the gold medal ratio of Chinese teams had 3 troughs. They were 2008, 2011 and 2014. From 2011 to 2013, there were regional jamborees. From 2014 to 2016, all the teams participated in the Giant jamboree, but the high school teams were not awarded medals until 2014. We found that from 2011 to 2013, the gold ratio increased from 39.1% to 65.9%. From 2014 to 2016, the gold ratio increased from 40% to 50.7%. The analysis told us that Chinese iGEM teams can quickly adapt to the changed situation and judging criteria to get better results.
2. Intergrated HP with other teams
a.Southwest Union
Having a deep cooperation with Southwest Union(iGEM meet-up in southwest China) last year, we viewed the meet-up an important role in our early-stage, thus, as soon as our project get mostly shaped, we discussed with SCU-WestChina about holding the Southwest Union meet-up of 2017. Together with the SCU-WestChina, SCU-China , UESTC-China and SICAU-China, we have an overall assessment of the safety and feasibility of our project and the latest trend of iGEM competition including the newly added judging terms, etc. What matters most was that all teams exchanged information and built a deeper relationship.  Particularly, SICAU-China and SCU-WestChina shared us with their experience of facing the problem that working on a very similar project with quite a few teams, and we finally decided to keep our project to see what can we achieve.
b.XJTLU-China
This year, we aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria-- Staphylococcus aureus, while XJTLU-China happens to working on a quite similar project. However, we had difficulties synthesizing the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids, and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, XJTLU-China had the similar construction and provided us with their group I Staphylococcus aureus’ s agrC and agrA genes.
3.Intergrated HP with researchers
CCiC Conference:
As the competition approaches, the Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) conference was hosted by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU-China), in order to simulate the iGEM Giant jamboree and enhance further communication among different teams. This was a great opportunity to present our work and learn from the other 48 teams. It was nice to see that we did a good job in presentation and the audience was attracted by our project. The most important thing to us was that we harvested much useful advice from the judges, mentors and students. We made the best of the Panel Session and poster exhibition to establish collaborations with other teams. Interestingly, we were lucky to have deep conversations with Igem headquarter King L. CHOW and former iGEMer Zhang Haoqian, who encouraged us to go deeper in research and promote iGEM and synthetic biology research in our university. From the CCiC, we were aware of our current disadvantages in quantitative measurement and the overall logic, which laid a foundation for the later adjustments and improvements. More importantly, we made great acquaintance with many students and establish deep collaborations with teams with same interest, including ShanghaiTech University and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University.
