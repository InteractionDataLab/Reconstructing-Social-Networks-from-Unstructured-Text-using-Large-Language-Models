Overview
For our project this year, we used two separate mathematical models to provide insights and to help guide us in the correct experiment direction. Below is a concise yet detailed overview regarding the two models.
Part I. Isolated Enzyme Kinetics Model
Part II. Genome-Scale Metabolic Model
Goal
Analyze the viability of the genetic circuit in producing the desired substrate - tagatose. Analyze the functionality and effects of different circuit designs (one-cycle vs two-cycle system) on the yield tagatose.
Goal
Analyze the effects of our synthetic circuit under different growth conditions once integrated into the model organism PCC 7942.
Experiments
Simulate circuit dynamics and compare tagatose production results for the one-cycle and two-cycle circuit. Perform sensitivity analysis on resultant circuit design, to understand how its different components may influence tagatose yield.
Experiments
Conduct the viability check when incorporating the synthetic circuit into the model organism. Test growth rate under different growth conditions for both the GMO and non-GMO.
Conclusion
The two-cycle circuit does not show a significant increase in tagatose production and thus the gene associated with that is discarded in the wet lab construction. Furthermore, the resultant circuit is found to be insensitive to sucrose when in abundance (the real-life scenario).
Conclusion
The artificial circuit does not to impose a significant metabolic load for our model organism, and the two-cycled system is, again, proved not to have a significant advantage in tagatose production. However, more care needs to be taken while tweaking the growth conditions (CO2) in order not to collapse the system.
