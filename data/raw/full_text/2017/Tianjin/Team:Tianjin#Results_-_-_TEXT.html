Results
Helping TUST prepare for their first year of competition.
To begin with, we gave them construct suggestions, communicated with their team adviser. In 24/3/2017, we were invited to TUST to carried out recruiting propaganda for them, and provided our construction guide.
2017.08.01
In 2017.08.01, TUST and Tianjin held a meeting together, during the meeting, TUST gave an account of their recent progress, we suggested them to add some new synthetic routes and elements, and probably new strain instead of simply Xylinus for fibrin.
Later on
Later on, TUST came again with their modeling problem, we gave them suggestion that we can share the Fluorescence method and modeling method with them, design Fluorescence experience and modeling together since it’s their first year competition.
Helping NKU with their plasmid construction
1. NKU asked us to help them construct a plasmid. Using pEX18Gm as the supporter, we ought to added Lyase gene sequence（which they had already provided） and xyR-xyA sequence from pAX01 as well.
After construction
After construction, they sent us plasmid pAX01 and the plasmid which contains Lyase gene sequence, we helped them with ligasion and transformation.
Test the mini system for OUC
Mini system is a system composed of a mini promoter (about 100bp) and a mini terminator, and it is applicable for yeast. Because of the similarity of our biological chassis, they reached out to us and wanted us to run some control experiments for them. Using the same protocol and their mini system, we need to transform the system into our Saccharomyces cerevisiae in order to test if the plasmid will still function the same.
Protocol
2. Protocol: initial OD600 = 0.01          Test OD600 and threshold fluorescence every other 5-6 hours              Exciting light λ=502/Emissive light λ=532
Sent a Collaboration Request and construct an alliance to build a worldwide database.
We came up with the idea that we could gather all the iGEM team whose project is about water pollution treatment together and build an alliance to unite all our social impact, knowledge and geographical advantages.
2017.08.12
2. In 12th of August, we had a voice conferencing with SJTU/SCUT/XMU/UCAS/JLU/FAFU, we discussed about how we want to use this alliance and came up with 2 conclusion: 1. Build a worldwide database containing contents of heavy metals in soil 2. Mutual improve our social impact
2017.08.23
In 23th of August, we sent a Collaboration Request to iGEM official website, the next day Ana Sifuentes replied our message and posted our request in the iGEM official website, and we received the response of many teams like team EXETER and team CSMU NCHU TAIWAN, with their information, we construct a database which contains the worldwide data of contents of Cu2+/Cd2+ in soil or water. And we build it based on map of the world.
Helping CQU construct their team and sign up for their first year
First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.
This one goes deeper
A good rule for rocket experimenters to follow is this: always assume that it will explode. The vehicle explodes, literally explodes, off the pad. The simulator shakes you a little bit, but the actual liftoff shakes your entire body and soul.
Even deeper
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And a level-3 title again
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
Filmed a biosafety video together with other 12 teams
12 teams gather together to film a biosafety video, every team took different topics, but all based on Yale biosafety manual.
