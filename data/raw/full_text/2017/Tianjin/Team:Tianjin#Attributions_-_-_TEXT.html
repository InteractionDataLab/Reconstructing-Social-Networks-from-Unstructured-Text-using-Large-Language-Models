What We Did in This Summer
In this summer, we designed genetic circuits, validated new technology and achieved application of heavy metal enrichment, for the first time on a cell chassis with synthetic genome.
We started from synthetic yeast to acquire more innovative genetic circuit.
We utilized the forefront of genome rearrangement technique, SCRaMbLE, to obtain double resistance to copper and cadmium by rapid evolution.
We upgraded exsisting parts for the purpose of more sensitive biosensor which had a wider response range to copper.
We employed our genetic circuit to realize biological enrichment of copper and cadmium.
We successfully modelled bistability, biosensor and biological adsorption.
Team members
