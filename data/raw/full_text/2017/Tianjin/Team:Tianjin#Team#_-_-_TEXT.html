Prof. Yingjin Yuan
Professor Yingjin Yuan
is the founder of iGEM
Asia platform.
He and MIT worked
together and successfully
promoted the iGEM in
Asia.He is also one of
the first introducers of
synthetic biology to
China.
He has been
enthusiastically
supporting since iGEM in
Tianjin University since
year one.
Prof. BingZhi Li
Prof. Li received his Ph.D.
degree in biochemical
engineering from Tianjin
University, and has been
on the faculty at Tianjin
University School of
Chemical Engineering
and Technology since
2010. He is the principle
investigator for the
projects from NSFC, MOE
of China, and involved in
several programs from
MOST of China. He joined
the first iGEM
competition, and has
been instructing Tianjin
University iGEM teams
since 2007.
Hui Xu
I’m Hui Xu,
the instructor of Team
Tianjin. Participating
in project design,
experiment operation,
human practice,
wiki construction and
modeling, I have a
deeper understanding of
Synthetic biology
and will insist on
exploring the unknown
area of Synthetic
biology.
My name is Mingzhe
Han, student leader of
Team Tianjin. My major
is Chemical Engineering
but I cannot be more
interested in synthetic
biology, so I decided
to apply for Ph.D in
this career and
participated in iGEM
again to learn more.
Besides, I made many
good friends here and
learned the importance
of team work. I could
say nothing but love
you to all of members.
I am a sophomore
student majoring in
chemical engineering.
On the frontlines with
experiments, I am
completely obsessed
with the charisma of
synthetic biology.
During the whole process
I gained much experience
for teamwork and
collaboration, since
iGEM is a
multidisciplinary
competition,
which needs a concrete
and efficient division of
labor.
Chen is a sophomore
majoring in chemical
engineering, the founder
of RFP’s
characterization
system, the girl making
PCR machine running
all day long. She likes
fresh thing, and thinks
synthetic biology is
amazing. She is addicted
to iGEM, and can’t
extricate herself.
As our team's web
designer, I explore new
frontier of web
construction.
Although I am major in
chemical engineer,
I put all my heart
on our wiki.
Although my major is
Chemical engineering,
I do the workof wiki
editing for our iGEM
team. Dare to
explore, be happy to
accept new things. Keep
curious in our twenties.
Hello，I'm from
Hangzhou, China, and
major in Chemical
Engineering and
Technology in Tianjin
University. Driving
by the novelty of
synthetic biology, I joined
the iGEM in our institute.
In my leisure time, I’d
like to do some reading
and photographing.
Hi, my name is Angelina.
I have been involved in
synthetic biology for
almost a year.
I was fascinated by
synthetic biology and
I am now committed
to connecting lab
work with the world.
Felt good to a part
of this game.
Hello! I am a senior
student of
pharmaceutical
engineering from Tianjin
university. I have
many interests like music,
drawing and movies. I am
a big fun of biology
because I think it is
amazing, just like the
part, SCRaMblE, which
I managed in this
year iGEM.
A novice in chemical
engineering. A dabbler
in synthetic biology.
A sophomoric junior
who is still confused
about what his real
passions are except
Coldplay. Motto being
carpediem but
seriously not in favor
of a life of hedonism.
iGEM is a marvelous
experience. Wish
everybody a good time
in Boston.
Lingyi means the first
place in Chinese,
although I have hardly
ever been number one.
Majoring in
pharmaceutical
engineering,
I am keen to learn
more about
synthetic biology,
which may be the path
I will follow.
I made friends with like-
minded people who are
as lovely as me, and
that's the most
important.
Hello! My name is Tu Lin
and my English name is
Turing which has the
same pronounciation
as my Chinese name.
I am from phamacutical
engineering in chemical
engineering institude.
I have had passion for
bio-engineering since I
was in middle school.
It is really my privilege
to participate in iGEM
and enjoy a great time
doing experiments with
my teammates. I am also
willing to communicate
with young people from
other countries.
I am in the
pharmaceutical
engineering profession.
Like to sleep, eat, watch
animation, play games,
and finally the most
important thing is to do
experiments.
I'm Shiyu Zhang, a
sophomore student
majoring in chemical
engineering. My idol
Yigong Shi once said,
“The 21st century is the
century of biology”.
Because of this, I
attended iGEM. Thanks
to it, I met vigorous
friends. Some of them
say they have an
inexplicable crush on
biological lab.
Designing an experiment
and testing it is my dish.
“I felt somewhat titillated
when they decided to do
something “romantic”,
but it turned out that they
just wanted to keep this
“romantic” relationship
only between two
yeasts!”
I am ZHOU GUO,
responsible for
experiment of heavy
metal.
I am a chemical
engineering Bachelor
versed in heat, mass,
momentum transfer as
well as chemical reaction.
I’m very interested in
molecular biology and
willing to unravel the
mystery of DNA.
Moreover, I’m in charge
of part of experiment
process and
biology modeling.
Hello everyone～
My name is Wang Xinru.
I am studying in TianJin
University. Like most
of the young people, I
love listening to music
and reading. Most
important of all,
I enjoy the days spent
with other iGEMers of
our team, which will
be a memorable
experience of my life.
Major in Chemical
engineering. Interested in
synthetic biology
and Bioinformatics.
I’m in charge biology
modeling. And I am one

World Copper,
Cadmium Pollution Map,
bistable model and
simulation of functional
switch.
My name is Manlin Yang,
a sophomore majoring in
applied chemistry.
I’m the designer of team
logo, poster, presentation
and clothes. As an
amateur art designer
straining every nerve for
the Jia Father but always
in vain,I must say that
you have good taste if
you enjo your
propaganda items:)
Hello, I am Li Sun.
Do anyting that I like,
and this is one of my like.
Hi, I’m Yan Zheng,
majoring in chemical
engineering and
technology. I
consider participating in
iGEM a unique
opportunity to challenge
myself, from which I not
only broadened horizons
but also gained
knowledge and
friendship.
