. One of the most severe disasters was the one that happened in Hunan Province, 

China. It was mainly about the leaking of heavy metal ions in Xiangjiang River and 

the Huaihe River. The arsenic content of the main contaminated areas exceeded 715 

times at maximum and the Cd^(2+) content exceeded 206 times at maximum.</P><P>In thirty-six Bay mining area of Chenzhou, Hunan Province, arsenic content of 

Guanxi River sediment exceeded 715.73 times. In Ganxi village’s paddy field, Cd^

(2+) content exceeded 206.67 times. The highest content of Pb^(2+) in paddy field 

reached to 1527.8mg / kg (that is per kilogram containing 1.5 grams), exceeding 

5.093 times.</P></DIV><H3>Looking for help from Government</H3><P>After noticing the repeated pollution incidents, we began to do some surveys to 

find out whether the heavy metal pollution incident was particularly prominent not 

only in China but also all over the world. So we began to evaluate the meaning of 

our project. First, we started from China.</P><P>We visited the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection which was the 

<B>highest environmental protection departments</B> in China. We asked them how 

serious the heavy metal pollution was in China at present. The Vice Minister of 

Environmental Protection of China told us that the part of Yangtze River near the 

coast, whose water of the best quality in our seven major river systems had 

been affected by heavy metal pollution including Cd, Cu and Pb. And in the 21 

cities along the river, six cities' percentage of heavy metal pollution 

accumulation had reached 65%. </P><H3>Set up an alliance</H3><P>Since serious pollution problems had brought up, we decided to do something. To 

gather all the forces together for more information and power, we established 

the China Heavy Metal Pollution Research and Investigation Alliance, which consisted 

of SJTU / SCUT / XMU / UCAS / JLU /FAFU.</P><DIV class="zxx_zoom_demo" align="center"><DIV class="small_aqqtu”&gt;

1 The pollution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is more serious than that in the United 

States and Europe: Although we don’t have comprehensive data for Africa and Latin 

America, but we still can find this phenomenon.
2, the distribution of pollution is not uniform or normal, but most of the region 

at a good level of the environment at the same time, there are some serious 

polluted areas.
3, many countries and regions are still lacking of investigation of copper and cadmium 

pollution and supervision, so there may be more areas having serious copper and cadmium 

pollution.
4, for our project, our work is of high social value. On the one hand, for the 

existence of the world's serious copper and cadmium pollution situation, our 

project can provide viable solutions and ideas. On the other hand, while some areas 

are seriously polluted, other regions even ignore the investigation of copper and 

cadmium pollution. Our projects can, to a certain extent, contribute to the 

attention of these countries for copper and cadmium pollution
Through the mapping of copper and cadmium pollution in the world, we understand the 

pollution of copper and cadmium around the world, but because of constraints of our 

team’s human resourse and time, the world copper and cadmium pollution map has a 

lot room for improvement, we sincerely hope and welcome other teams to 

participate in this work.
</P><P>At the same time we would like to be able to play our own efforts to hold some 

science popularization activities, which aimed to attach importance to the issue of 

heavy metal pollution. In order to be able to make a real and effective database 

containing heavy metal pollution data around the world, we also launched an 

invitation on the official website of collaboration called for more iGEM teams to 

join our alliance or to provide some data and information. As a result, we received 

mails from iGEM EXETER,  iGEM CSMU X NCHU TAIWAN and Nazarbayev University, and 

Exeter provided us with European data and shared their own protocol with us.</P><DIV class="middleone"><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:1.7rem;text-align:center">E-mails sent by iGEM EXETER and Nazarbayev University</P></DIV></DIV><P>Besides, CSMU X NCHU TAIWAN provided us with statistical information on heavy 

metal pollution in Taiwan and listed the major pollution incidents in Taiwan in 

recent years for us. </P><DIV class="zxx_zoom_demos"><DIV class="small_pic_demos" style="float:left;"><P style="font-size:15px;text-align:center">e-mail sent by CSMU X NCHU TAIWAN.

Environmental Sciences at Tianjin University. He told us that the study of heavy 

metal removal from groundwater was a very important subject that still needed to be 

studied. It was of great value to use micro-organisms in heavy metal removal. So we 

decided to focus our project on heavy metal treatments and on treatments of cadmium 

and copper due severity of pollution. Then, we learned that recently the heavy 

metal deposition research center in Hunan had made a great breakthrough. So we held 

a telephone conference to communicate with their technical teacher. During the 

conference, we asked the current situation about heavy metal pollution, and consulted 

their approach to chromium ions sedimentation. That was turning high-valent chromium 

into low-valent chromium to reduce toxicity. This inspired us to think about if 

there was any better way to completely settle the chrome ions from the water.</P><H2>Searching the source of pollution: Zhongtiao Mountain Heavy Mental Factory, electric drill 

factory</H2><P>Because our experiment needed to base on the actual problem in our life, in the beginning, we left school for Zhongtiao Mountain Heavy Mental Factory  factory in Shanxi Province and 

electric drill factory in Henan Province.</P><P>Before we went to the drill factory, we turned to the EPA of Shanxi province for help. We had a teleconference at first, they showed their interests in us and gave us a chance to talk face to face. With excitement, we went to the EPA of Shanxi province and after they talked to us, they offered to send a director to accompany us. It's actually a really amazing reponse of EPA.

</P><P>The Zhongtiao Mountain Heavy Mental Factory mainly produced waste water that contained copper and cadmium ions while the 

electric drill factory mainly produced cadmium and nickel ions. The staff there told us, the reason why factories and EPA usually didn't use yeasts for water treatment was mainly about treatment efficiency. Pollution sources usually contained more than one kind of heavy metal ions, a single species couldn't absorb a variety of metal ions, mixed yeasts needed stricter conditions. It also cost too much.If they were going to use yeasts, then it must create high economic benefit, and it would be better to recycle heavy metal ions. They also pointed out that nowadays nearly 90% of the treatment was through

chemical methods. And most of the time, in order to 

deal with that two kinds of heavy metals, some factories tended to use simple and 

quick ways which could be harmful to the environment.</P><DIV id="fudong2"><DIV id="img2"><P align="center">Waste liquid from chemical treatment</P></DIV><P>And some factories directly choosed to only deal with one kind of the 

heavy metals that had a larger amount, then abandoned another kind of heavy metal 

without treatment. Based on the current situation that the treatment for a variety 

of heavy metals are not well developed, the issue of how to deal with a variety 

of heavy metals contained in polluted water has been considered as the primary 

problem, we hope to use yeats to collect two metals separately in different 

periods.</P><P>In order to deal with this problem, we put forward a method named mating 

switcher, using the natural function of <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>. We hope to use 

the gender transition of <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> to realize the transition  of 

function so we can settle different kinds of heavy metal step by step.</P></DIV><H3>Seek advice by communication with other teams</H3><P>After those surveys, we had a meeting with Professor Zhang Haoqian and the 

leader Zhang Yihao from Peking team of Peking University. They expressed a keen 

interest on our team's mating switcher, and pointed out the defects of our 

experiment: 1. How could we improve the specificity of yeast to absorb heavy metals? 

2. How to separate these two metals?</P><DIV class="zxx_zoom_demo" align="center"><DIV class="small_aqqtu”&gt;

Wugang City, Henan Province. The processing plant was representative, but we found 

that as a demonstration unit of the sewage treatment plant, they did not detect 

heavy metal ions usually. Only when the heavy metal content exceeded standard 

emissions, the information could be transferred to the Environmental Protection 

Agency. Thus, there existed two problems. 1.Domestic sewage treatment plant did not 

have its own set of a detection system. 2. Once the heavy metal content exceeded, 

there was no corresponding solution.</P><P>At the same time we were told that mixed yeasts were mainly used in the process 

of the treatment of domestic sewage. Our goal is to realize a heavy metal treatment system as well as an automatic detection system in our yeast. We hope that we can have the chance to put our yeast into treating sewage one day, so the second thing we need to do is to put a detector in our yeast.</P><P>To solve this problem, we should come up with a method that allows people test 

the content of heavy metal and when the concentrations are higher than the standard, 

the settling process can be started. So we put promoter induced by copper into our 

gene route, so that when the concentrations of copper are higher than the standard, the 

gene route can start.This method is called RFP detection.</P><P> Things did not let us down, we went back to the sewage plant after we constructed our detector, the general manager met with us and listened to our feedback, and they were very glad that we had very interesting ideas. At the end of the day, they offered to have a long-term relationship with us, if we had any problems or need to put it on trial, they would be glad that we turn to them in the first minute. We were so amazed by the outcome that we decided to do more to perfect our project.</P><H3>Tolerance issues: steel companies</H3><P>Next, with our own ideas, we communicated with technical staffs from the 

pollution department of Hebei Iron and Steel Group Wugang company, Henan Province. 

(China's first base of thick steel plate production and scientific research. The 

main bearing frame of The Nest, Chongqing Chaotianmen Bridge and The Shanghai 

Central Building's are produced in this company). They led us to visit their cycle 

industrial waste water treatment equipments and they told us that generally the 

industrial wastewater was discharged to a sewage pool at first, then they would carry 

out the treatment of heavy metal ions. General strain could not tolerant such heavy 

metal concentration in industrial sewage, and the treatment using microbial required 

oxygen and nutritional conditions. Therefore, we planned to improve the tolerance of 

yeast and they agreed that if our strains could meet the requirements, they were 

willing to make their sewage pool be our first batch of test.</P><P>However, the tolerance of natural yeast to copper ions and cadmium ions 

conditions cannot be able to put into production. Improving the tolerance and 

competitiveness of yeast to heavy metals is a necessary condition for our 

project.</P><P>Improving the growth of yeast in high concentrations of heavy metal ions is the 

a key part of the application in production. We choose the cre-loxp system to rapidly 

evolve <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> to improve its resistance to copper and cadmium 

ions. The cre-loxp system utilizes the cre enzyme and the loxp site on the 

chromosome to cause the gene to be replicated, inverted, displaced and deleted, 

which is semi-rational changing of the chromosome structure. The modification of 

the gene depends on the direction of the loxp site. When in the same direction, the 

gene between sites will be deleted. On the contrary when in the reverse direction, 

the gene in the locus will flip. The genes located on different chromosomes may 

also be translocated. Based on artificial synthetic chromosome No.5 and No. 10, we 

use the loxpsym site inserted between the genes of the chromosome to turn on the 

recombination system through the cre enzyme. The difference between the loxpsym 

locus and the traditional loxp site is that the special palindromic structure of 

loxpsym locus will cause the possible structural changes of chromosomes. The 

strains with the high concentration of metal ions will be selected under different 

concentrations of metal ions. So that the biological treatment of heavy metal 

pollution is more feasible.</P><H3>Cooperate with the government and the Environmental Protection Agency</H3><DIV id="fudong3"><DIV id="img3"><P align="center">Visit the tailing in ShanXi Province</P></DIV><P>In the end, we brought our results to an iron ore factory belonging to Anshan Iron 

and Steel Group in Henan Province and Zhongtiaoshan Nonferrous Metal Company in 

Shanxi Province, hoping to find the source of pollution and deal with the pollution 

from there. Their staffs told us that the main way of emissions in China was at present 

through the discharging to the tailings.</P></DIV><P>We contacted the Shanxi Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, the staffs 

were very supportive of our ideas, so they sent a full-time staff to lead us to 

Shanxi's largest copper mine, where we understood the existence of tailings. The 

Tailings was a place that collected the sewage especially. Because of the high cost and 

a long period of treatment, the EPA generally did not deal with it. However, it could 

be harmful to the environment. So we hope that in the future we can utilize our 

yeast here.</P><P>Tailings deal with heavy metals by means of physical filtration. The processing 

intensity is not enough and there also exists harm to the environment. Generally 

the Environmental Protection Agency will take over the pollution, then outsource it 

to the heavy metal processing company to treat the pollution. At the same time we 

were informed that if the tailings was handled properly, there would be chances to 

create a huge wealth by re-extract the heavy metal here. We gave them the suggestion 

that they were supposed to consider withdrawing the water from the tailings 

reservoir and using our <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> to handle the heavy metals 

remaining in the tailings reservoir. At the same time, we consulted the Beijing, 

Shanxi, Henan Environmental Protection Bureau and their counterparts in the 

outsourcing company, Zhongke Dingshi Non-ferrous Metal Company. This company had a 

nice response on our results and they were willing to be our first experimental units if 

our experiment reached the point of maturity.</P><H2>Multi - party communication and self – examination</H2><P>We also participated in the Fourth CCiC conference. At the meeting, we exchanged 

our ideas and shared our experiment with other teams, and received questions raised 

by them: 1. Whether the synthetic yeast would mate with natural yeast after 

delivered in nature, which resulted in gene integration. 2. It would be better if we 

could make the original copper detection switching device switch on and off 

automatically according to the concentration of copper ions.</P><DIV class="twopic"><DIV><P style="font-size:15px;text-align:center">take part in the Fourth CCiC conference.</P></DIV><DIV><P style="font-size:15px;text-align:center">take part in the Fourth CCiC conference.</P></DIV></DIV><H2>How we affect the world</H2><P>Human practice is about how the world affects us, but also about how our project affects the world, so it is quite important that we expand the scope of our influence and make a real difference. So we put major effort in responding the society. We aim to make some economic benefits through our project to prove that our project has potential to invest. We also aim to promote our project ideas in the places that need our ideas. Although our ideas haven’t been able to be applied to real processing system right away, we hope to promote our ideas and influence the world as much as we can.</P><H3>Get an investment of nearly 100,000 RMB</H3><P>we talked with the leaders of these companies about our project, we contacted some influential biological companies. At first, we aimed to solve the heavy metal pollution problems in our planet. And then they showed extremely high interests to our project and decided to help us by donating some money and biological reagents so that we could carry out our project more smoothly. In the end, we had raised 80 thousand RMB in all and biological reagents cost ten thousand RMB. </P><H3>First trial station</H3><P>Besides, we also kept a close contact with the EPA in a various province in order to know more about the policies and situation of heavy metal pollution. They all answered our questions enthusiastically，and told us that if we needed any help they could offer, they would not be hesitant to help us. And every time we finished a small section, we would contact with them to discuss whether it is feasible in policy. </P><H3>Long-term partner</H3><P>What' s more, we also had a talk with heavy metal treatment company to know more about the recent technology of settling down the heavy metal so that we could know what we should do to make it more suitable for the environment. They said that our total project was extraordinary because we used genetically modified strains to settle down heavy metal, which solved the problem that these strains could not survive in water containing so many heavy metal ions and they said that they would be willing to use our method to remove heavy metal from water when our project became more mature.</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="site-footer" style="text-align:center"><DIV class="footer-content"><DIV><H2 class="footerwords"><A href="https://twitter.com/iGEMTianjin2017" target="_blank">@iGEMTianjin2017</A> |  Tianjin University, NO.135 Yaguan Road, Jinnan District, Tianjin City, China</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer-mobile"><H2><A href="https://twitter.com/iGEMTianjin2017" target="_blank">Twitter:@iGEMTianjin2017</A>
