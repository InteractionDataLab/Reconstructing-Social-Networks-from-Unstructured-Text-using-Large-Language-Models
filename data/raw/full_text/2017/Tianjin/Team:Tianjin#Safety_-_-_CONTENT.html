In order to prevent <I>synX</I> leaking into the environment and threatening the ecological equilibrium, we have enacted the relevant regulations. When the yeasts emerge on solid medium, we will pick it into a clean tube, as the template for PCR or inoculate it in the liquid medium. The next step of the experiment such as transformation, PCR or other experimental steps often produces
waste. For residual yeast fluid, we gather it into a special waste bottle and then inactivate these yeasts through steam sterilization at high temperature and pressure. So we can pour them into the sink without further problems. Similarly, we gather those solid waste generated during the experiment into a separate box labeled &quot;Synthetic yeast&quot;, such as solid medium or centrifuge tube containing <I>synX</I>, after steam sterilization at high temperature and pressure. As for reusable experimental consumables, we can kill microbes by  alcohol sterilization or flame burning.</P><DIV class="twopic"><DIV><P style="font-size:15px;text-align:center">Fig 1. High pressure steam sterilization.</P></DIV><DIV><P style="font-size:15px;text-align:center">Fig 2. Spam markup.</P></DIV></DIV><H2>TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (BIOSAFETY VIDEO) </H2><P>The transport of biological agents has a huge impact on the environment. So we, iGEM teams of China, decided to make a relevant video for more people to learn the details in the transport. The whole biosafety video was made by 12 teams and every team took different topics, but all based on Yale biosafety manual.</P><H2>LAB SAFETY</H2><P>Before we started our experiment, we first trained in laboratory safety knowledge. Our team members were guided by different graduate or doctoral students strictly to carry out correct experiment operations. After we started our experiment, we created a set of laboratory safety manuals that everyone should strictly observe or would be criticized. We also conducted a test about security knowledge in which the substandard people need to re-learn the relevant knowledge.</P><P>What's more, because our project this year is to deal with heavy metals, our experimental materials contain a mount of copper ions and cadmium ions. Cadmium salt is highly toxic and the air and food polluted by cadmium is serious harm to human body. We need to deal with cadmium ions carefully to prevent cadmium ions from polluting water and endangering the safety of laboratory personnel.</P><H3>Experimental Operation Safety </H3><P>1. Gel electrophoresis experiment: Because the golden view is carcinogenic, we set up a special room as gel electrophoresis experiments area. All things in this room all not allowed to be taken out, like gloves, transfer liquid guns and Conical flasks etc..2. About reagent: The laboratory should be kept clean and tidy. We should put back the reagent to its original position after we using it. We regulate pH with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. So we need to wear gloves when we use these reagents. What's more, dilute the concentrated hydrochloric acid in the fume hood.3. Personnel protection: The main objects of the experiment are E.coli and yeast. These microbes can make us sick if we don't pay attention to details. Wear gloves and do not touch your mouth and nose with your hands when doing experiments. Do not take laboratory supplies out of the lab. Clean your hands after the experiment. Do not eat, drink, smoke or makeup in the laboratory work area.
</P><H3>Heavy Metal Treatment Safety</H3><P>1. Storage: We store cadmium ions in a reagent bottle marking the name, molecular weight and &quot; <I>Highly Toxic!</I> &quot;.2. Using: We wear gloves when we use heavy metal to make culture medium. We will clean our hands after experiment of course.3. Treatment: We have a special bottle to recycle liquid waste and a special box to gather solid waste like a plate with copper or cadmium ions culture medium and tubes. Both of them have been labeled. For example, for the bottle of liquid waste containing cadmium ions, we will write &quot; Cd liquid waste. <I>Highly Toxic!</I> &quot;. Then we will contact the teachers of the inorganic laboratory to deal with the collected heavy metal wastes.</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="site-footer" style="text-align:center"><DIV class="footer-content"><DIV><H2 class="footerwords"><A href="https://twitter.com/iGEMTianjin2017" target="_blank">@iGEMTianjin2017</A> |  Tianjin University, NO.135 Yaguan Road, Jinnan District, Tianjin City, China</H2></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer-mobile"><H2><A href="https://twitter.com/iGEMTianjin2017" target="_blank">Twitter:@iGEMTianjin2017</A>
