Protocols
In order to make our experimental procedures clearer, we have isolated them from our notebook on the page below. Most of our protocols come straight from the instruction that come with our experimental kits. However through discussing with our advisors, and through doing these experiments ourselves, we made a few changes to make the processes more efficient and effective. We are happy to share these protocols and hope that people reading in the future will learn from any changes we made!
