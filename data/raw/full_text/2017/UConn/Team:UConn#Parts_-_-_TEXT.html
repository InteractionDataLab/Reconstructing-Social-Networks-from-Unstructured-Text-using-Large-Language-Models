Parts
We submitted six parts at the conclusion of this project. These parts included the VCP1 promoter and VCP2 terminator we used to express algal DNA, the lipase and thioesterase genes we isolated to increase algae lipid content, the ABC transporter we used to for lipid excretion, and a hygromyocin resistance gene that was planned on being used as a selection factor for algae. The names, part numbers, and descrption of the parts are shown in the spreadsheet below:
