6.21
Transformation of pMG36e into E.coli Top10
6.22
Transformation of pUC57-DRGN-1 into E.coli Top10
Grow pMG36e-transformed E.coli in LB broth
6.23
Isolation of pMG36e plasmid from bacteria solution
Grow DRGN-1 transformed E.coli in LB broth
Run agarose gel for pMG36e. Result: no target band
6.24
Isolation of pUC57-DRGN-1 from bacteria solution
Double-enzyme digestion of isolated pUC57-DRGN-1 using EcoRI and PstI.
Run agarose gel for confirmation. Result: confirmed.
6.25
Repeat the amplification experiment of pMG36e
Preparation of DH5ɑ competent cells
6.26
Select single colony of pMG36e-transformed E. coli, and transfer in LB broth.
Amplify the E. coli DH5ɑ containing pNZ8148 plasmid
6.27
The extraction of pMG36e and pNZ8148 plasmid
Digestion of pNZ8148 using XbaI
Agarose gel electrophoresis of digested pNZ8148. Result: confirmed, and the extracted plasmid is in super-coiled form
6.30
Gel electrophoresis for pMG36e, pUC57-DRGN-1 and pUC19. Results：no band for pMG36e, the other two are successful.
