Education and Public Engagement
Best Education and Public Engagement Special Prize
Over the last few years, we have seen teams produce some truly outstanding work in the areas of education and public engagement. Innovative educational tools and public engagement activities have the ability to discuss the science behind synthetic biology, spark new scientific curiosity and establish a public dialogue about synthetic biology from voices/views outside the lab.
To compete for the Best Education and Public Engagement prize , please describe your work on this page and also fill out the description on the judging form .
