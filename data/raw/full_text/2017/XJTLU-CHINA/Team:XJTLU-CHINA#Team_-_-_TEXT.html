About us
With an explicit aim to utilize knowledge to benefit public welfare, we, students with strong social responsibility and curiosity for synthetic biology, decided to organize our own team to strive for participating in the 2017 iGEM competition. Team members of 2017 iGEM are from diverse backgrounds, but all of us are very industrious, cooperative and have the same goal. Each of us does our best to make contributions to the progression of this year's iGEM project. Not only do we reap academic knowledge and skills, but we also gain precious friendships through this meaningful competition experience.
