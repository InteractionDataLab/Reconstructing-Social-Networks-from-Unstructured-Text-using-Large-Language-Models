Reagents:
Staphylococcus aureus solution (37℃, 200rpm, overnight culture);  Anti-microbial peptides stock solutions (1mg/ml) (or AMPs: LL-37, Grammistin-Pp1, GF-17) (China Peptides, Suzhou); LB agar plates
Procedure:
Defreeze AMP solutions at 4℃.
Add 170μl of LL-37, Grammistin-Pp1, GF-17 solutions to form a 1:1:1 LL-37+Grammistin-Pp1+GF-17 solution.
Measure OD600 value of Staphylococcus aureus after 9 hours’ culture.
Inoculate 100μl diluted S. aureus (OD600≈0.4) on each medium.
Pipette 20μl each peptide solution on each paper disc (LL-37, Grammistin-Pp1, GF-17, and LL-37+Grammistin-Pp1+GF-17).
Dry all discs.
Place 2 paper discs with peptide, 1 paper disc with positive control (chloramphenicol) and 1 negative control (buffer: PBS+BSA+HAC) for each plate.
Overnight culture at 37℃ condition.
