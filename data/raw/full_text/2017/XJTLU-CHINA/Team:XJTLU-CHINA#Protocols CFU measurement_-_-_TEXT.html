Pre-experiment: CFU measurement
Pre-experiment: CFU measurement
Reagents:
Staphylococcus aureus solution (37℃, 200rpm, overnight culture); LB agar plates
Procedure:
Dilute Staphylococcus aureus solution with x10, x100, x500, x1000 concentration gradients. Vortex each concentration of solutions for 1-3min;
Use microscope to count the cell number of different concentration gradient.
Culture each concentration gradient of Staphylococcus aureus solution on LB agar. Add 20μl of solution on plate for each concentration. Do 3 repeats for each gradient.
Overnight culture at 37℃ condition.
After overnight culture, count colonies.
