Collaboration with NAU-CHINA:
This year, we helped NAU-CHINA to construct two composite bioparts from the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6 into the plasmid                 pSB1C3:

--Design of the primers
The strategy we chose was the conventional restriction digestion and cloning method. First we designed 8 primers to amplify                 the basic parts in the plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-kanMX6:
Primer 1: 5’GCTCGAAGCTTCAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTT 3’
Primer 2: 5’CTATCGGATCCCTATTTGTATAGTTCATCC 3’
Primer 3: 5’GATAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGATGACGACATGGAGGCCCAGAATAC 3’
Primer 4: 5’ACAGTCAAGCTTGGTTGTTTATGTTCGGATGTGATG 3
Primer 5: 5’ CCGTGCAGGATCCGCGAATTTCTTATGATTTATGATT 3’
Primer 6: 5’AGAATCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTACCGGTAGAGGTGTGG 3’
Primer 7: 5’CGCACTGGATCCACTGACAATAAAAAGATTCTTGT 3’
Primer 8: 5’ATAGCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTACAGTATAGCGACCAGCATT 3’
These parts were digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into the plasmid pSB1C3.

And, we express our sincere thanks to NAU-CHINA who made lots of efforts to help us construct our mathematical                 models, and their works are shown below.

Collaboration with TMMU-China
This year, TMMU-CHINA aimed to build a quorum sensing tool kit based on the Agr system from the Gram-positive bacteria-- Staphylococcus aureus. However, they were not able to synthesize the genes agrC and agrA in plasmids,                 and therefore, the experiments were not able to conduct. Fortunately, we had the similar construction and                 provided them with our group I Staphylococcus aureus’ s agrC and agrA genes. The plasmid we sent them is shown below.
And, thanks to TMMU-CHINA for willing to help us to test the efficiency of antimicrobial peptides LL-37, GF-17, Grammistin-Pp1,                 and DRGN-1 on Staphylococcus aureus with our own protocols.
Collaboration with ZJU-China
When conducting the Interlab measurements, we accidentally kept LUDOX-S40 at -20 °C and made the silica irreversibly precipitated.                 Thanks to ZJU-CHINA for sending us a tube of LUDOX-S40, and thereafter, we carried on and successfully finished                 the experiments.
Collaboration with Lanzhou (The iGEM team)
In September, we received an invitation from Lanzhou iGEM team for a video interview on the dilemmas and issues our team                 had encountered and how we dealt with them. We conducted a video communication on 30th and exchanged ideas                 about the current situations of project development in our respective universities. Furthermore, the management                 of the iGEM team was also discussed in this conversation.
On balance, this conversation benefited both of our teams a lot. Through helping Lanzhou with their human practice investigation,                 we gained much experience on team operation and learned how to resolve the unforeseen issues.
Collaboration with Greece（The iGEM team）
In October, we helped Greece with a survey questionnaire about evaluating their project’s benefits and potential side effects.
