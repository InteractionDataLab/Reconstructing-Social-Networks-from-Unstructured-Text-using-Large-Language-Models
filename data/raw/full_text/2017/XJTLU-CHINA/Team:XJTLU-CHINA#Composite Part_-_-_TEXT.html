BBa_K2309005
Manifestation of AIP-induced expression initiated by P2 promoter
Visualization of the expression of the agr-regulated system induced by AIP by measuring the fluorescence                     from sfGFP

BBa_K2309027
Single copy of the anti-microbial peptide (AMP) gene
Anti-microbial peptides can kill S. aureus. His-Tag is added to the peptide to provide a means of specifically detection and purification                     of the AMPs
