AMPs efficiency and MIC assay
AMPs efficiency and MIC assay
Reagents:
Staphylococcus aureus solution (37℃, 200rpm, overnight culture);
Anti-microbial peptides stock solutions (1mg/ml) (or AMPs: LL-37, Grammistin-Pp1, GF-17) (China Peptides, Suzhou); LB agar plates
Procedure:
AMPs dilution
Take AMPs stock solution from -20℃ freezer.
Dilute AMPs by PB buffer. The conc. gradients of diluted AMPs as follow:
LL-37: 80ug/ml, 40ug/ml, 20ug/ml, 10ug/ml, 5ug/ml, 1ug/ml, 0.5ug/ml;
Grammistin-Pp1: 40ug/ml, 20ug/ml, 10ug/ml, 6ug/ml, 3ug/ml, 1ug/ml, 0.5ug/ml
GF-17: 20ug/ml, 10ug/ml, 6ug/ml, 3ug/ml, 2ug/ml, 1ug/ml, 0.5ug/ml
After each dilution, vortex 1-3min for each of concentration of AMPs
Staphylococcus aureus dilution
Measure OD600 value of original Staphylococcus aureus solution.
Dilute Staphylococcus aureus solution 500 times and 1000 times respectively in different EP tube by PB buffer;
After dilution by PB buffer, vortex each conc. gradients of solution 1-3min.
AMPs and Staphylococcus aureus interaction
Pipette 50μl diluted AMPs solution and 50μl diluted Staphylococcus aureus solution (1/500 and 1/1000 diluted) into one EP tube.
Vortex each EP tube for 1-3 min.
Incubate 3.5 hours at 37℃, 180rpm condition.
Plate 30μl mixed solution into the LB agar medium. Overnight culture at 37℃ condition.
