Nisin induction of gene expression in <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>
Nisin induction of gene expression in Lactococcus lactis:
Testing of S. aureus sensing pathway
(Transformant with pNZ8148 harboring BBa_K2309005):
Grow 5 ml successfully transformed bacteria culture overnight, 30 °C.
Dilute 1/25 in 2 x 10 ml fresh medium (30 °C). Grow until the OD600 ≈ 0.4.
Induce one 10 ml culture with 0.5 - 5 ng/ml nisin (typically 1 ng/ml is used) and keep the other 10 ml culture as negative control.
Incubate 2 - 3 hours/
Aliquot both control group and experiment group into 96-well plate.
Test the fluorescence under the set of 485 nm excitation and 510 nm emission.
Autolysis test
(Transformant with pNZ8148 harboring BBa_2309004):
Grow 5 ml successfully transformed bacteria culture overnight, 30 °C.
Dilute 5-fold with fresh medium.
Aliquot 200μl culture into each well of 96-well plate. Grow at 30℃ in plate reader with a regular test every 30 minutes until stationary phase (OD600≥3).
Induce with 0.5-5 ng/ml nisin (usually 1 ng/ml). Continue to observe the growth curve with a regular OD600 test every 1 hour.
