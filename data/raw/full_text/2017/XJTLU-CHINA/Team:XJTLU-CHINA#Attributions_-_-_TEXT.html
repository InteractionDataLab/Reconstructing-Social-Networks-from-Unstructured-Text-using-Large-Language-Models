This year our team is made up of 7 biological scientists, 4 bioinformaticians and 1 chemist, all of whom are new to iGEM. We started our project design in January this year and finally decided our project —— Grenadier Guards on May 1st after four months of intense and independent brainstorming process. We have been putting ceaseless effort such as conducting wet experiments and mathematical modeling since the middle of June. During this long time battle, we are trying our best to understand our individual roles and responsibilities, as well as devoting all our time and energy to this project. Although our project is not mature enough and we are not that experienced, we really appreciated this special iGEM experience from which we have gained some precious qualities like perseverance and diligence, as well as establishing strong and sincere friendship with each other.
Self-supporting
Management:
Both Yijing Gong and Tianjun Wang were student team leaders. Yijing Gong put lots of efforts on dry experiments, human practices, collaborations and later wet experiment designs. Tianjin Wang focused more on designing and managing the wet experiment initially, as well as communicating with several biological reagent suppliers.
Overall idea:
Huiting Li and Ziying Jin first came up with the idea about using anti-microbial peptides to fight against Staphylococcus aureus. Huiting has done lots of jobs in searching information to support our idea at the early stages. Yijing Gong and Haohui Fang helped to design the initial biological circuit.  Later, Yijing Gong, Tianjun Wang, Zixin Rong and Yiyou Song communicated and modified the circuit further.
Wet experiments:
The majority of our members participated in wet experiments. The main members in each group are listed below:
Testing on the efficiency of DRGN-1: Tianjun Wang, Haohui Fang
Testing on the efficiency of LL-37, GF-17 and Grammistin on killing bacteria and destroying their biofilm: Zixin Rong, Yiyou Song, Xidan Zhang
Quorum sensing testing: Ziying Jin, Xidan Zhang, Yijing Gong
Peptide gene synthesis in single copy: Sijie Feng, Haohui Fang, Yiyou Song
Peptide gene synthesis in tandems repeats: Zixin Rong, Haohui Fang
Autolysin AcmA testing: Tianjun Wang, Haohui Fang, Yiyou Song, Yijing Gong
Interlab: Tianjun Wang, Yiyou Song, Ziying Jin
NAU-CHINA’s vector construction: Yijing Gong, Zixin Rong
Mathematical Modeling:
We made a collaboration with Nanjing-Agriculture University this year. Yijing Gong communicated and helped them to understand our project, as well as search and collect parameters for NAU-CHINA to build modeling. Later, Yijing Gong modified and built the final modeling.

Collaborations:
Collaboration with NAU-CHINA
Yijing Gong and Zixin Rong helped to construct two vectors using pSB1C3 plasmids. Zixin Rong designed the primers, and Yijing Gong finished the whole experiments.
Collaboration with TMMU-CHINA
We helped them design and synthesize the quorum sensing part.

The back-up supporting
Sincere and special thanks to
Dr. Guoxia Han supported us at every step of iGEM. He gave us alerting suggestion on scientific research and made his best to ensure us go ahead bravely. He would also accompany us to the giant jamboree and take care of us in the U.S.
Dr. David Chiu spent long hours supervising us and gave his valuable help throughout the whole project. He also prepared extra classes to help us understand more about synthetic biology techniques and lab safety.
Prof. Dechang Xu supported us by listening to all our concerns and encouraging us to find solutions. He also advised us on our modelling strategies and helped us to get connection with many of our sponsors and collaborators.
Mr. Yunpeng Zhong is quite talented at synthetic biology and helped us a lot when we got stuck at the difficult time.
Mr. Zhongkai Huang and Ms. Sijing Meng supervised us in the lab all along.
