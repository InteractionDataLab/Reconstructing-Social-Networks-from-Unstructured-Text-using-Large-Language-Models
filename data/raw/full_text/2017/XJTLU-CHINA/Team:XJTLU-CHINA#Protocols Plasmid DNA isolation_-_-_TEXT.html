Plasmid DNA isolation from <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>
Plasmid DNA isolation from Lactococcus lactis
Materials:
Procedure:
Use 5 ml full grown culture
Spin down 10 min 3000 x g or more (up to 6000 x g)
Re-suspend pellet in 250 μl THMS-buffer + 2 mg/ml lysozyme in Eppendorf cup
Incubate 10 min at 37 °C
Add 500 μl 0.2 N NaOH + 1% SDS, shake carefully (no vortex)
Incubate 5 min on ice
Add 375 μl ice-cold 3 M potassium acetate pH 5.5, shake carefully
Incubate 5 min on ice
Spin 5 min in Eppendorf centrifuge (Maximum Rotation Speed)
Take out supernatant and add to 2 ml new Eppendorf cup
Add 0.7-1 ml 2-propanol
Incubate 5-10 min at room temperature
Spin 10 min in Eppendorf centrifuge (Maximum Rotation Speed)
Wash pellet carefully with 70% ethanol
Dry the pellet (vacuum)
Dissolve the pellet in 50 μl TE or sterile water
(For our project, the plasmid we used is pNZ8148, which is chloramphenicol-resistant)
Applications in our project: pNZ8148 extraction
