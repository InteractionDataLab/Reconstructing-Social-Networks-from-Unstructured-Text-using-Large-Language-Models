KAM-Spec & Synthetic Biology Education
An Introduction to Synthetic Biology & iGEM
The purpose of making KAM-Spec was to create a device that could be used a low-cost and accurate alternative to lab-grade plate readers, so that the functionality of such devices could become more accessible to the synthetic biology community.               As a result, all of our design choices were made by weighing the low-cost versus performance and trying to find the sweet spot that would give us the best of both.               KAM-Spec was built to be applicable in general synthetic biology experiments and thus to perform like a standard plate reader.               However, with the community in mind, we also made sure that all design choices did not hinder the modularity of our device.               With all that in mind, these are the design goals with which KAM-Spec was built.
KAM-Spec in Education
A key component of the bioengineering curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania is a required lab class in which students get their first direct exposure to how bioengineering applies to different fields of science.               In particular, one of the lab modules is heavily synthetic biology-focused as students are introduced to the concept of quorum sensing in biology. As students get a more in-depth understanding of quorum sensing, they are asked to model the response of a strain of E. coli expressing GFP after being induced with AHL at various concentrations.               More specifically, the students explore how synthetic changes in biological circuits to the promoter affinity and AHL affinity affected the dose-response of the bacteria.               As it stands now, during the lab students have to measure the expression of GFP in 60 samples all using a standard benchtop spec from Vernier. When discussing with the students and faculty what could be improved with this segment of the lab course, they all pinpointed that this manual measurement of 60 samples in class is very time consuming and prevents students from really focusing on what is happening biologically.               Therefore, we proposed KAM-Spec as a way of solving this problem in future versions of this class as it would enable students to simply just pippett samples into a 96-microwell plate and take all the measurements within matters of seconds.               To prove to the educators of this lab course that KAM-Spec would be reliable enough to resolve differences in dose-response curves of the three different strains, we performed absorbance measurements on the strains used in the class.               The results from these measurements can be seen in the Performance section of our wiki.               For now, we are still in phase of demonstrating that KAM-Spec could be used in this lab course but the preliminary data that we have gathered looks promising.               Therefore, we hope that after further testing and development of KAM-Spec it will be able to be used in the education environment and help students get hands on experience with Synthetic Biology.
