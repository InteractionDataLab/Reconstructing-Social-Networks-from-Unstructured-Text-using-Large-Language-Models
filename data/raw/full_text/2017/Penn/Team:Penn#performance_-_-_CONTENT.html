															The Penn iGEM team consists of three undergraduate students in bioengineering. The team would like to thank all of the people who helped us complete our project! A special thanks to our iGEM Mentors Mike &amp; Erin and our Team Advisor Dr. Chow.

															<B>Protocol:</B> 90 uM of Rhodamine (in Trizma buffer) wasloaded into a 96 well plate. Fluorescence and absorbance spectra were subsequently gathered by both the KAM-Spec and Tecan plate reader. Each curve was normalized to its respective max so that the spectra could be overlaid and compared.
															<B>Results:</B>  The results are plotting in the graph below. As shown, our device captures the fluorescence spectra of Rhodamine very well, with the peaks overlaying nicely at approximately 587 nm. The absorbance gathered by our device is slightly blueshifted and does not capture the rhodamine shoulder that the Tecan captures. The peaks are slightly off, with our device giving a max absorbance at 540 nm but the Tecan giving us 550 nm.

															<B>Protocol:</B> Four different strains of E. coli NEB Turbo were transformed with plasmids containing the luxR transcription factor and GFP under control of the pLux promoter. These strains varied with regards to luxR-AHL sensitivity and total luxR concentration. Cells were induced by varying concentrations of AHL and grown for 24 hours at 25C. GFP was measured on the KAM-Spec, and data was fit to a simple Hill model for visualization purposes.
															<B>Results:</B>  The results are plotted in the graph shown below. As shown, our device is capable of measuring the AHL-dependent dose response of GFP expression in these strains, and we can pick up differences in the strains due to their biological parameters.

															<B>Protocol:</B>  EL222 is a LOV-domain based transcription factor that photocycles in response to blue light. Upon absorption of a photon, the flavin cofactor in EL222 forms a covalent bond with a nearby cysteine within the binding pocket. The formation of this bond, and the reversion back to the original state, can be measured by tracking the absorbance of the sample at 450 nm over time. Using purified EL222 protein, we illuminated the sample using a blue LED for 1 minute and 30 seconds within our device, then measured the absorbance over time in 5 second intervals to see if we would see a kinetic change in absorbance and return to the baseline value.
															<B>Results:</B>  The results are plotted in the graph shown below. As shown, our device is capable of measuring the reversion kinetics of the EL222 photocycle. This is done completely within our device, demonstrating the added flexibility our device allows in performing optogenetic experiments that require the perturbation and measurement of samples in rapid succession.
