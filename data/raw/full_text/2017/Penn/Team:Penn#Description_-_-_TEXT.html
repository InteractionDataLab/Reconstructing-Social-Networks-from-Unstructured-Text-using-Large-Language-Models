Description
The University of Pennsylvania's 2017 iGEM team is creating a low-cost multi-well plate reader designed to improve access to high-throughput synthetic biology experiments. It will be capable of generating complete fluorescence spectra (via a low-cost monochrometer) and OD600 measurements. Every design-process decision that contributes to our final product will be made with a cost versus performance ratio in mind to ensure that our machine is affordable, reliable, and accurate. Our machine will be one that students can assemble from detailed schematics using cost-effective hardware, rapid prototyping technologies, and open-source software.
