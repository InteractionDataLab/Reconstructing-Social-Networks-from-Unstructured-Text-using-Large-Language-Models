How KAM-Spec Handles Light
The Fundamental Elements of KAM-Spec Optics
The optics in KAM-Spec are quite possibly the most important aspects of the device, as the way the machine handles light determines how well it can perform spectroscopy measurements.                In this case, the optical system of our device can be split into the following three fundamental elements: Excitation, Emission & Integration.                Each element specifically addresses how the device handles light before, during or after interacting with the sample being measured.
Excitation
What is it:
This portion of the optics directly deals with handling how the sample in the device is being exposed to light. In other words, how is the light input being done inside of KAM-Spec
What we did:
In order to provide the most modularity and customizability in terms of the light that is being input, we decided to use simple LEDs as our light sources and fiber optic cables to handle light transfer.                    More specifically, our device includes four LEDS of different colors as the primary sources for excitation light.                    There is a white LED, primarily used for absorbance measurements as well a blue LED (λpeak = 467 nm), yellow LED (λpeak = 588 nm), and red LED (λpeak = 627 nm), which are used to calibrate the device.                    The LEDs are coupled to a 4-to-1 fiber optic cable from Thorlabs, with a collimating lens at each end of the fiber to help direct all the light from the LED into the given fiber.                    The singular end of the fiber to which any of the LED light is directed to, is positioned directly over a microwell plate thus shining all the light from the LED onto the sample.                    A visual representation of how the light travels through this system is shown in the animation to the left.
Why we did it:
This optical set-up for the excitation was chosen for two specific advantageous reasons.                    The first, is that by using the 4-to-1 one fiber optic cable we were able to create an optical system in which there are no moving parts.                    We are capable of simply turning on a given LED and do not have to worry about positioning it accurately over the sample with motors or anything of that sort.                    This coupling system also enabled us to cement the location of the vertical light source in place, thereby getting rid of yet another potentially moving part in our device.                    In other words, this set-up ensures consistency in the exposure of the sample to light, which is vital for the accuracy and precision of our device.                    The second reason for this set-up was to allow for easily swapping out the LEDs in this machine. This important not only in case of when an LED breaks and has to be replaced, but also when the user wants to perform an experiment with light at different wavelength than the ones listed above.                    In fact, this feature allows the user to input any wavelength LED into the machine and be able to run experiments with it.
Emission
What is it:
This portion of the optics directly deals with handling how the light output from the sample is resolved into its component wavelengths and projected onto a detector.
What we did:
In order to allow KAM-Spec to be able to perform full spectrum detection with a singular measurement, we created an emission optical set-up consisting of four components: A fiber optic cable, a reflective diffraction grating (λBlaze = 500 nm), a cylindrical lens (f = 50 mm), and a 3648 pixel CCD Linear Array Camera from Mightex.                    The light path (as shown in the animation to the left) is as follows:                    (1) the light out through the sample is input into the setup via the fiber optic cable which is directed at the diffraction grating.                    (2) Once the light hits the diffraction grating, it gets reflected, with each individual wavelength reflecting at a slightly different angle.                     This means that the light reflected off of the grating is spatially separated by wavelength.                    (3) This light is then directed through the cylindrical lens, which narrows the light vertically.                    (4) The light from the cylindrical lens is focused on the detector of region of camera horizontally.
The camera reports the pixel intensity of each individual pixel, which is representative of the individual wavelength at the pixel.                    Thus by making the diffracted light span the entire camera detector, KAM-Spec is a capable of spatially resolving a full spectrum representative of the light coming through the sample.                    Furthermore, to prevent the optic set-up and alignment from being ruined by small vibrations due to the functionality of the device, we placed the entire emission setup on a Sorbothane sheet to dampen the vibrations.
Why we did it:
Optics in general is highly dependent on proper alignment of components and usually moving parts frowned upon as even the smallest change of position can completely throw the light path off.                    Nonetheless, the way in which most benchtop specs and even plate readers handle analysis of light wavelength composition is by extremely fine-rotation of a reflecting grating which directs light into an  extremely narrow slit.                    This directly links wavelength selection to the amount that the diffraction grating is turned. Though this type of set-up works extremely well the issue comes with the price of components necessary to be able to build such a system.                    Hardware with the precision control fine enough to be able to replicate such an optical design is expensive. As a result, we chose the components we did to ensure that we would not need to have any moving parts on the emission side of the optics, thereby reducing any potential error due to moving components and also allowing us to keep the device at a reasonable price.                    Furthermore, we chose to go with the CCD Linear Array camera as a detector, because it allowed us to do what current plate readers are not able to do, resolve a full spectrum in one measurement, which also circumvents the design of a mechanical wavelength selection mechanism.
Integration
What is it:
This portion of the optics directly deals with how the input light for absorbance or fluorescence is passed into the sample and how the light out from the sample is detecte
What we did:
In order to allow KAM-Spec to perform both absorbance measurements and fluorescence measurements without any extra moving parts, we 3D printed a small piece capable of holding a fiber optic cable perfectly vertical and three LEDs at  53.77 degrees relative to the vertical axis of the fiber optic cable.                    This piece is directly positioned below the microwell plate and is vertically aligned with the top light source.                    The specific geometry of this set-up is visualized in the animation to the left.
Why we did it:
Normally, in spectroscopy absorbance measurements are performed directly head-on, with the light source, sample, and detector all being perfectly aligned. In contrast, fluorescence measurements are performed with the light source  usually being at a 90 degree angle relative to the detector.                    This change in angle, is necessary to get proper measurements, as the excitation light, if exposed onto the detector will mask the emission light of the sample.                    The problem with moving this sort of logic to plate readers, is that due to the form factor a microwell plate, it is actually physically impossible to shine a light source at 90 degrees relative to the detector.                    Therefore, in order to enable fluorescence measurements on KAM-Spec, we needed to create a form factor which would allow the device to shine the excitation light an angle such that it exposes most of the sample to the light hence maximizing the detector fiber optic to emission, but also minimizing the amount of excitation light that gets directed into the detector fiber.                    By optimizing the distance between our detector and the well plate as well as the angle of the LED, we were able to create a form factor, that is capable of performing both absorbance and fluorescence measurements while keeping the detector region fixed in place.
