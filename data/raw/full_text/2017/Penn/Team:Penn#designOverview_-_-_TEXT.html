The Deciding Factors of Building KAM-Spec
Our Design Goals
The purpose of making KAM-Spec was to create a device that could be used a low-cost and accurate alternative to lab-grade plate readers, so that the functionality of such devices could become more accessible to the synthetic biology community.               As a result, all of our design choices were made by weighing the low-cost versus performance and trying to find the sweet spot that would give us the best of both.               KAM-Spec was built to be applicable in general synthetic biology experiments and thus to perform like a standard plate reader.               However, with the community in mind, we also made sure that all design choices did not hinder the modularity of our device.               With all that in mind, these are the design goals with which KAM-Spec was built.

Rapid Full Visible Spectrum Acquisition
As current plate readers are only capable of taking measurements at one wavelength at a time, we wanted to create KAM-Spec to have this limitation.               As a result, we chose to design our device with the capability of being able to measure the full visible spectrum of a sample in a singular measurement thus allowing the user to perform a full spectrum analysis on a large amount of samples in a short amount of time.               This aspect brings the advantage of benchtop specs and adds it the functionality of a plate reader. By using a diffraction grating and a camera, we were able to spread the visible spectrum onto the camera simultaneously so that a single photograph captures the entire visible spectrum.
Absorbance & Fluorescence Capabilities
In the synthetic biology community, both absorbance and fluorescence measurements are extremely pertinent to properly analyzing biological sample functionality.               As a result, we wanted to make sure that KAM-Spec is capable of performing both of these measurements accurately and precisely, thus enabling the device to be used for a multitude of experiments typical found in synthetic biology.               By using excitation lights positioned vertically above and angled below the plate we achieved absorbance and fluorescence capabilities.
Rapid Acquisition Time
In addition to absorbance and fluorescence measurements, the synthetic biology community utilizes optogenetics experiments to characterize different protein structures.               If KAM-Spec was unable to perform optogenetics experiments it would lose it’s appeal to many synthetic biologisits.

Hardware
Simple Assembly
Going along the lines of the open-source hardware initiative we wanted KAM-Spec to be able to be assembled easily and in a quick amount of time.                The overall goal here is to make the assembly process so accessible that anyone can look at the open-source documentation and build their own version of our device.                By using parts that are not permanently attached and do not require any machining or serious manufacturing skills we achieved this design goal.
Easily Serviceable & Customizable
One of the big issues with lab-grade equipment is that the user does not really know what parts are inside of it, what they necessarily do and how to fix them if something goes wrong.                As a result, we wanted to design KAM-Spec to be the complete opposite.                In other words, the goal here was to make the device extremely modular and easy to service in case something broke.                Furthermore, with modularity in mind, we also wanted to make sure that our device is customizable for the individual user.                This means that depending on what functionality the user needs from our device, they can achieve it by simply swapping out specific components without hindering the functionality of the other parts. By using parts that can be taken apart easily and utilizing screws and nuts for all connections, we were able to achieve this design goal.
Low-Cost
As mentioned previously, the biggest disadvantage of lab-grade plate readers on the market currently is their cost.                With that in mind, Penn iGEM’s biggest goal for KAM-Spec was to create a device with the functionality of a plate reader for a much cheaper.                More specifically, the goal we set for ourselves was having the device come in under $3,000 compared to current devices which go for $50,000.                By using low cost aluminium bars for the chassis of the device and 3D printed PLA material for any parts not manufactured by prominent vendors we were able to achieve a low cost design.

Software
Raspberry-Pi Frontend
As one of the main software avenues in the open-source  community is Linux, we wanted KAM-Spec to be based in this OS as well.                In addition, we also wanted our device to be standalone, thereby not requiring a computer to work.                With these two parameters in mind we chose to base the frontend of our device software in the Raspberry-Pi, as it is a credit-card sized Linux based computer.
Open-Source & User-friendly
In order for our device to be useful in the scientific community, the user interface which we created need to be user-friendly.                More specifically, this means that our device could not have a user-interface that is extremely convoluted, confusing and extremely hard to use.                Our goal with the software behind the user-face was to make it as straightforward as possible.                In addition, as we are making all our software open-source ensure that it was written clearly and coherently so that if any member of the community wanted to tweak it, they could do so very easily.
Arduino Backend
Knowing that the raspberry-pi does have its limitations in computing power we did not want to make the entire device dependent on the Raspberry-Pi hardware.                As a result, we decided to make the backend of our device software run off an Arduino.                This allowed us to split the workload of KAM-Spec across two controllers, thereby maximizing the device efficiency and making troubleshooting simpler.
