The WHAT, WHY & HOW
Spectroscopy 101
Spectroscopy is an analytical method which analyzes the properties of a biological or chemical sample based on its interactions with light at various wavelengths. When performing spectroscopic analysis, the two fundamental measurements which can provide a lot of information about the sample being investigated are: Absorbance & Fluorescence
Absorbance, analyzes the interaction between light and a sample by looking at what the relationship between the energy of the light going into the sample and the light coming out of the sample is.                A measurement like this is particularly useful in analyzing the concentration of molecules in a solution. The more concentrated the solution is, the less light will be able to get through thus yielding a higher absorbance.                In general, it follows that the absorbance and concentration of a sample solution are directly proportional to each other and can be related using a fundamental formula called, Beer’s Law (A = εLC).                This allows the measurement of absorbance to be directly converted to a value of concentration, and thus giving information about the number of molecules in a sample.
Fluorescence, is a phenomenon which occurs when a sample absorbs a specific wavelength of light (excitation wavelength) and then proceeds to emit light at a higher wavelength (emission wavelength).                Depending on the energy of light being emitted, specific traits of the sample being analyzed can be distinguished as their specific chemical structures which give rise to fluorescence.                As a result, this measurement is useful when analyzing the chemical composition of a sample (i.g. analysis of whether a specific protein is in its folded state, high fluorescence, or unfolded state, low fluorescence).                Common used substances to demonstrate fluorescence include fluorescent dyes like Fluorescein (excitation color: blue, emission color: green) and Rhodamine (excitation light: green, emission light: yellow)
Why Spectroscopy in Synthetic Biology?
Since the goal of synthetic biology is to generally synthesize new or modify existing biological systems, there needs to be some sort of technique to ensure that the biological entities are behaving as expected.                Fortunately enough, spectroscopy is that technique, with absorbance and fluorescence being the standard measurements used to characterize the behavior of biological systems.
Absorbance in the synthetic biology community is widely used to measure the concentration of cells in a sample.                Specifically, a common term among synthetic biologists is Optical Density, OD600.                This refers to the loss of light observed at 600 nm from the interference of bacteria.                When the 600 nm light hits bacteria, it scatters and lowers the amount of light exiting the sample.                Thus, a measurement similar to absorbance can be made to determine the concentration of bacteria in the sample.                The more cells that exist in solution, the higher the OD600 absorbance value will be.                Using such a method, synthetic biologists can track cell growth during experiments.                While OD600 is a common application of absorbance in synthetic biology, many more applications exist.
Fluorescence, in synthetic the biology community is widely used to analyze biological circuit behavior.                Fluorescence can be used to analyze complex biological circuits by adding a reporter gene, i.e. a fluorescent protein such as GFP when induced by AHL, to the end of the circuit.                GFP will fluoresce green light when it is excited by blue light. An increase in the amount of GFP production will result in an increase in the amount of green light detected.                Using such a method to monitor the amount of green light detected, synthetic biologist can evaluate  the effects of various changes to the upstream portion of the genetic circuit.                While analyzing biological circuits is a common application of fluorescence in synthetic biology, many more applications exist.
How is Spectroscopy done in the Synthetic Biology Community?
Currently there are not many unique options when it comes to performing spectroscopy measurements in the synthetic biology community.                In fact, all the available equipment can be really grouped up into two major categories of devices: Benchtop Specs & Plate Readers.                Each come category has advantages and disadvantages however none are perfect.
Plate Readers, are the most prominently used spectroscopy devices in research laboratory settings and professional institutions.                These devices allow for multiplexable functionality, where absorbance and fluorescence measurements can be performed rather quickly and accurately on a large sample size (in most cases a 96-microwell plate).                The ability to analyze 96 samples at once, is in itself a very attractive feature of these devices, as it allows performing experiments on a larger scale, thus allowing for  more statistically significant results. That being said, lab-grade machines like these also come with their own disadvantages.                Specifically, current plate-readers are not capable of performing rapid full spectrum measurements on a sample. In order to yield the full spectrum of a biological sample, the machine performs the measurement at each wavelength individually for the entire desired range of wavelengths.                This is a very time consuming process, and makes it impossible to resolves dynamic changes in spectra. Furthermore,  as these devices are lab-grade, they are also extremely expensive. Companies like TECAN Ltd for example sells their plate readers for about $50,000.00.                Such high cost limits the accessibility of these devices to laboratories or education organizations which do not have sufficient funding for such a machines.
Benchtop specs, a widely used alternative for plate readers in educational settings offer much less in functionality when compared to lab-grade plate readers, however, they are much cheaper. Benchtop specs (i.g. SpecVis from OceanOptics) are available within the range of $3000.                The lower cost of these is usually the main reason why so many organizations are attracted to buying them instead of plate readers. Furthermore, these devices also have the capability of measuring the absorbance or fluorescence across the full visible light spectrum in a single reading.                This is in fact, one functionality advantage that benchtop specs have over plate readers. However, even with this benefit, these devices really limit the user in number of samples which can be measured efficiently as they only allow one sample to be measured in a cuvette at a time.                In other words, benchtop specs are not capable of multiplexable functionality.                In addition, another disadvantage for these devices is that most of them only have three set wavelengths at which fluorescence measurements can be taken, thus limiting the user to those three options.
Benchtop Specs
Manufacturers: OceanOptics, Vernier
Advantages: Low-Cost, Full Spectrum Capability, Extremely Compact
Disadvantages: One sample per measurement (No Multiplexable Functionality), Set amount of possible wavelengths
Plate Readers
Manufacturers: TECAN, Illuimina
Advantages: Multiplexable Functionality, Multiple Wavelength Analysis
Disadvantages: Extremely High Cost, Large and Bulky, No Full Spectrum Capability
From the above comparison, the current devices which are used for spectroscopic measurements can be summarized as follows:
(1) Lab-grade plate readers, though providing high-throughput and multiplexable functionality, have limited accessibility due to their high cost.
(2) Benchtop specs, although they offer a cheaper alternative, do not have the functionality necessary for running efficient large sample sized experiments normally necessary in synthetic biology
The Open-Source Solution
Fortunately enough, the science community knows that lab-grade devices are extremely expensive and for the most part not very customizable.                As a result, building your own open-source versions of typical labware is becoming the new trend across the world.                This initiative offers the ability for individuals or scientific organization which do not have the money to buy lab-grade devices, to equip themselves with the necessary tools in order to do good science.                As it stands now, a large number of lab hardware has been turned into open-source devices including centrifuges, cell-phone based microscopes and even 3D-printers.                The following link includes a library of open-source devices that exist currently and available to the general public: LIBRARY OF OPEN-SOURCE HARDWARE.
Our Solution
Armed with the knowledge, that current equipment to perform efficient spectroscopy measurements is either very expensive or lacking in functionality, the Penn iGEM team decided to join the trend of open-source hardware and provide the Synthetic Biology community with a plate reader device that is easily customizable, high in functionality and most importantly low in cost.
