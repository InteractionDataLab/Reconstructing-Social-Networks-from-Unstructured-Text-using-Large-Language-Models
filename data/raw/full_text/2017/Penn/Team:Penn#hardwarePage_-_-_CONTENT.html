															The hardware portion of the KAM-Spec ensures that the microplate is moved in space so that each individual well in the 96 well plate is aligned such that optical measurements can be taken.
															At its core, the hardware portion of KAM-Spec is concerned with balancing low cost components with repeatability, reliability, and modularity.
															The fundamental elements of KAM-Spec hardware are broken down into three main subsystems: the chassis, movement, and modularity.

																			This portion of the hardware deals directly with handling the outer frame of our device. In other words, how the skeleton of the device was built.																			<B>What we did:</B>
																			The chassis of our device  consists of an aluminum frame composed of 25mm x 25mm x 25mm bars supplied by 80 / 20 inc.
																			They are connected via 90 degree brackets, screws, and t nuts that are also supplied by 80 / 20 inc.
																			Furthermore, the floor and top of the chassis is composed of laser cut ¼ inch thick acrylic material.
																			A door supported by magnets on each side of the MDF siding allows for easy plate loading and unloading.
																			The sides of the chassis are covered by laser cut ⅛ inch MDF board.

																		</P></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="12u"><SECTION><P><B>Why we did it:</B>
																			We decided to build the chassis out of t-profiled aluminum for two reasons.
																			First, at 0.21 cents per inch these aluminum bars is very cost.
																			Second, the way these t-profiled aluminum bars are shaped allows them to function as both structural supports and tracks for the well plate holder.
																			MDF and acrylic paneling was needed for the sides of the device so that no light from outside the device could hit any of the optical components.
																			This way the device can be used under normal lighting conditions.

																			The movement of the plate through the linear actuators is the KAM-Spec’s method of reading all 96 wells.																			<B>What We Did:</B>
																			The microplate is moved via two linear actuators supplied by Acutonix that are attached an aluminum frame that holds the plate.
																			The mounts for the linear actuators are 3D printed, custom designed parts printed from PLA material on a MakerBot Replicator.
																			The plate itself is supported via a 3D printed holder that attaches to one linear actuator and the aluminum frame holding the plate.
																			<B>Why We Did It:</B>
																			When designing the movement components of KAM-Spec we wanted to ensure functionality and repeatability via low-cost components.
																			We decided the most effective motion system was one that functioned via linear actuators.
																			Linear actuators were optimal for our purposes because they are able to provide purely translational motion via direct connections to our aluminum stage.
																			As far as considerations go with regards to movement components, we needed to make sure the stroke length on these actuators was large enough to move each well in the plate over our light collection and excitation systems and because they had enough torque to move our stage constructed out of  the 80 ./ 20 inc. aluminum.
																			As can be seen via the video to the left, the linear actuators move the well plate in the x and y directions reliably.

																			Modularity is the portion of our hardware that deals with the user’s ability to succinctly and effectively alter different aspects of KAM-Spec without hindering it functionality.  																			<B>What We Did:</B>
																			Throughout the construction and design process of the KAM-Spec we ensured that each design we made ensured that our hardware subsystems are modular in nature. By using t nuts and screws, the user can easily detach and reattach any hardware component with ease. That is to say, none of the hardware components are permanently attached, and all are readily available from prominent vendors without any machining required.
																			<B>Why We Did It:</B>
																			All of the KAM-Spec hardware is modular in nature in order to allow users to change components of the device in order to tailor functionality to their specific needs.
																			For example, users can 3-D print a well plate holder for a well plate with a different number of wells (say 12 or 48).
																			Furthermore, adds on are easy with KAM-Spec. By utilizing the varying functionality of the t-slotted aluminum profiles on the chassis modules like fluid handling capability can be designed and incorporated while keeping the overall design of the plate reader consistent.
																			Additionally, the modularity of the device allows for easy repairs and adjustments should the device become damaged or misaligned.
