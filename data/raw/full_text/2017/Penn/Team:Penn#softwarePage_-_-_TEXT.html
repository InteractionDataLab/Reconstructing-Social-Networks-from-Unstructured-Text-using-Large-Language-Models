Paragraph about KAM-SPEC and how great it is. And what a well plate reader is. Quick information about how it functions, etc.
Arduino Backend
What is it:
In the software field, the backend of a program refers to the core computational logic of the program. It consists of features which are indirectly accessed by the user through a front-end user-interface.
What we did:
We decided to use an Arduino UNO as our backend software processor.                    The arduino is used to control the functionality of the linear actuators motors as well LEDs after getting inputs from the Raspberry-Pi based user-interface via the serial monitor.                    Once an input is received from the user-interface, the Arduino processes it and proceeds by either turning on a specific LED or moving the motors to a specific position.
LED Control
The electronic schematic of how the LEDs are connected can be seen below. We used IRF520 Power Mosfets to control the behaviour with 12V as the source voltage.                    By connecting the gate pin of each mosfet to a separate Digital Pin on the Arduino, the Arduino is capable of turning on or off a specific LED by sending a HIGH or LOW signal to the connected mosfet, respectively.
Motor Control
The Arduino interfaces with the motor by sending a direct signal to the LAC Motor Control board specifically made for control of L16 Linear Actuators from Actuanix.                    The control board takes in a signal from the arduino into its RC pin, and based on the length of the signal moves the motor.                    More specifically, the minimum signal duration that can be used is 1000us (which results in a full retraction of the motor) and the maximum signal duration is 2000us (which results in a full extension of the motor).                    Any value in between results in the position to be equal to a specific percentage of its full stroke length, which is directly dependent on the percentage of the duration relative to the range of acceptable durations (in this case 1000).                    Therefore, a signal duration of 1500us ( which is 50% of the  range of acceptable durations as (1500 - 1000)/1000 = .5) results in the motor moving to a position equal to half its stroke length.                    Furthermore, the Arduino also takes in feedback about the motors position from the LAC control board. By connecting the an analog pin from the Arduino to the potentiometer feedback pin on the LAC board, the Arduino keeps track of the motor position in real time.                    It also uses this feedback to know when the machine has reached a specific position and that it is time to turn on or off an LED.
Why we did it:
We decided to use an Arduino as our backend processor because we knew it was a reliable and cheap device which could continuously run a set program independently and efficiently.                    Furthermore, with its digital and analog capabilities, it allows us to control two important aspects of our device (Light Control & Motor Control) with a singular piece of hardware, thereby circumventing the need for additional pieces of hardware.                    Furthermore, the Arduino is a device which is used in the open-source community very often and as such we wanted our software to be based in programming languages that will be familiar to other open-source software.
User-Interface
What is it:
The user-interface is the main way in which the user is able to control KAM-Spec and input the specific parameters for running measurements with the device. What we did:
Using the Raspberry-Pi we created a simple GUI, based in Python,  as the main user-interface that can be accessed without the need to plug into any other computer.                    In fact, the user-interface is designed in such a way that it displayed on a Raspberry-Pi Touchscreen.                    With the user-interface, the user is capable of calibrating the device, choosing the order of measurements to be taken, and the specific settings with which to take the measurements.                    We also added the ability for the interface to show the spectra of the measurements being taken live and show the user which measurements have already been taken.                    Once all the measurements specified by the user are taken, the interface asks for the user to input their email address so that all the data (.csv files for the data and .png files for the pictures) can be sent over as a .zip file.                    Demonstrated in the video to the left is a tutorial of how the GUI performs. The Raspberry-Pi also controls the interfacing with the camera in our machine.                    It tells it when to turn on and grab a frame as well as specifies the exposure time of the camera.
Why we did it:
One of the main reasons we ended up using a Raspberry-Pi to create the user interface is that is capable of running Linux, which is the main operating system used by the open-source community.                    Furthermore, it allows the complex functionality and processing power of a computer but at the size of a credit card, which permits the devices to completely stand alone and not require access to a separate computer.
Integration
Below is a logic-map of the way that the hard-ware and software integrate together.
