Collaboration
Weâ€™re glad to collaborate with team SMS_Shenzhen in both human practice and part characterization this year.
As our team started out to work on our WeChat official platform for human practice promotion, we looked for guidance on how to maintain the site and write interesting articles. Fortunately, we got in contact with team SMS_Shenzhen from Shenzhen High School, and they mentored us on tips to construct attractive social media. We benefited a lot from their advice and help. We also gave team SMS_Shenzhen tips on how to document parts and construct the part wikis and helped them with their part characterizations.
