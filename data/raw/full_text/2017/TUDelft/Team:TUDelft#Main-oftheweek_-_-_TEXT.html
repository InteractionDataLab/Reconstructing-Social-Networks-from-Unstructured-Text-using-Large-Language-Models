    H.W.: "Ik heb brood bij me."

Role description:
As the wiki manager, I was responsible for the development of this wonderful website and educating my fellow team members the language most essential in communicating our project's findings: html. In addition to teaching and reviewing my students' work, I enjoyed countless hours of resolving the mistakes they made that rendered entire pages dysfunctional. No matter the challenge we were confronted with, my team members were always delighted when I stopped my occupations of that moment, put on my best smile and came over to save the day. It has always felt as a privilege to be part of this team and I am honoured to have received the 'Team Member of the Week' award 29 weeks in a row during the period that iGEM was our fulltime occupation.
