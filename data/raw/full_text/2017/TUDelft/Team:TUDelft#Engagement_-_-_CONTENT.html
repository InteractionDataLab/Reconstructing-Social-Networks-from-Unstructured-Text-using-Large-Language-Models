We realised the importance of incorporating a responsible and relevant design after our interaction with various stakeholders and the public and that we lacked this awareness before. With this mindset, we developed a video series tackling “how iGEM teams can improve work on stakeholder and public interaction by including both relevance and responsibility in their design”, and reflection materials, aiming to encourage stakeholder- and public interaction incorporation into future projects.

Additionally, we took this a step further and looked at how the education of future synthetic biology (synbio) engineers can be improved. We did this in collaboration with the 4TU Centre for Engineering Education. This institution works together with the 4 technical universities in the Netherlands to study issues in the development, use and regulation of techno­logy. We contributed to the future education of a synbio engineer that ensures the translation of complex but relevant synthetic biology research to society and also guarantee the communication and collaboration between different fields of expertise.

Our strong approach towards education was also carried into the public sector starting with the crafting of DNA key chains and educating the public about synbio during various events. Our interactive methods triggered the interest of the audience to learn more about synthetic biology and enter into a dialogue about its potential. The dialogues with the public continued even after our inspiring TEDx talk and presentations on several events</P><H3 id="videos">Education for iGEM teams</H3><H5>Our solution for the struggles of iGEM teams regarding stakeholder and public interaction</H5><P>As synthetic biology (synbio) engineers, we believe in the strengths and potentials of this field. However, for society, synbio is a difficult topic to understand and comes with negative associations with respect to ethics and safety. Due to this, allowing the synbio field to flourish is a challenge. </P><BLOCKQUOTE>Relevance and responsibility are two main aspects that fill the gap between engineers, industry and society</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Relevance and responsibility are the two main aspects that we consider to be important and undervalued in synthetic biology, taking into account that these two aspects are able to fill the gaps between engineers, industry and society. Furthermore, showing that synbio can be relevant and done in a responsible way will promote societal acceptance of synbio research and products.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col s12 center-margin"><DIV class="col s6"><P>With <H class="pink-text"><I> relevance</I></H>, the importance lies in the function of the product. It should have a synbio design with a clear purpose and bring added value to the society and industry. This will lead to further acceptance.</P></DIV><DIV class="col s6"><P>With <H class="pink-text"><I>responsibility</I></H> as an aspect will contribute in making the society feel comfortable with synbio research. Furthermore, engineers should be able to convince people that their product is for good, not harm. For this part, topics such as sustainability, safety and ethics should be taken into consideration.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Linking this to the iGEM competition, including relevance and responsibility, helps to achieve a strong <I>integrated human practices</I> and <I>public engagement</I> project. There topics are often seen as an abstract, difficult to interpret part of iGEM, something that we also struggled with in the beginning. We used our project as an example on how to make a project relevant and responsible for other iGEM teams and documented this process clearly in our video project. It will show the successes but also the challenges we experienced. With this, we hope to inspire other teams to do proper integrated human practices and to see its added value to the project.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>How can iGEM teams include responsibility and relevance in their design?</BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the first video, we illustrate why relevance and responsibility are the two main aspects of a successful synbio project. In the second video, we show the importance of stakeholder interaction and visualise how stakeholder interactions shaped our project. In the last video, we acknowledge that public engagement and stakeholder interaction were not smooth processes and we tried to identify what made it challenging. Not only have we been documenting our process to inspire other iGEM teams, we also aim to help future synbio engineers with tips and workshops illustrated in the videos.</P><H4>Relevance and responsibility: the duty of an engineer</H4><H5>Video 1</H5><P id="video1-scroll" class="scrollspy">The Titanic is a good example of a case in which engineers had to take almost opposing values from different stakeholders into account. Was it possible to design lifeboats that were safe and, at the same time, fit the unsinkable image? Synthetic biology is a field that can be seen as bearing huge potential, or as being extremely harmful. Is it the duty of synbio engineers to use synthetic biology for good and prevent harm?</P><VIDEO class="responsive-video center-margin" controls=""><H4>Our bumpy ride to a relevant and responsible design</H4><H5>Video 2</H5><P id="video2-scroll" class="scrollspy">A lot of assumptions we made from a synbio engineer perspective were incorrect. For example, the idea that GMOs with a killswitch would be instantly socially accepted or the idea that antibiotic resistance detection is straightforward and would solve the worldwide problem. These topics turned out to be more complicated than we previously envisioned. How did we become aware of the real challenges and how did we adapt our project?</P><VIDEO class="responsive-video center-margin" controls=""><H4>The key to a  relevant and responsible design</H4><H5>Video 3</H5><P id="video3-scroll" class="scrollspy">Looking back, integrated human practices was not a priority; our decisions about the project in the early stages were not based on safety or societal acceptance but more focused on doing good science and developing a cool project.</P><P>A lot of tools to do integrated human practices are available, but why are they not used by today's engineers? Can iGEM teams be motivated to do proper stakeholder and public interaction and validation considering relevance and responsibility?</P><VIDEO class="responsive-video center-margin" controls=""><H4>For teams to reflect and balance</H4><P id="tips-scroll" class="scrollspy">As explained in video 3, it makes it easier to start a project with a balanced team in order to create a relevant and responsible design. When a team is balanced, it is easier to oversee all the important aspects of the project. After defining our team roles in collaboration with 4TU Centre for Engineering Education, we developed a process and additionally a workshop to reflect on iGEM projects and to help iGEM teams become aware of their project approach, and to make team aware that some aspects in the project can only be answered with stakeholder- and public interaction. </P><UL class="collapsible popout"><LI><DIV class="collapsible-header">

</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><P>After identification of individual roles, iGEM teams are more able to discuss the goals, beliefs, frustrations and different project approaches within the team. Once aware of any unbalanced situations, the teams can invite other types of engineers in their team or ask external feedback from people with other perspectives on their project.

Step 3: Reflection Workshop
</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><P>Together with 4TU Centre for Engineering Education, iGEM TU Delft 2017 designed a reflection workshop that will help iGEM teams reflect on their synbio project using all four engineering roles equally. Teams that lack certain engineering roles, can invite students or people from other catergories.It has been validated that this workshop contributes to the awareness of all team members that stakeholder- and public interaction is important for the project. The workshop is based on validated reflection methods that help teams to achieve better results.

CEE
</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><BLOCKQUOTE>In order to boost engineering education, the Board of the 4TU Federation has decided to work together in a Centre for Engineering Education. The 4TU CEE aims to gather, develop and implement up-to-date expertise in engineering education. (New) improvements in education are implemented and the effectiveness of these improvements is monitored and analysed. The expertise and experiences of all four partners is exchanged to benefit all partners.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></LI></UL><H4>Our Findings and Contribution</H4><P>We found that our current education programmes are mainly focused on educating specialists and system integrators. We need to be more than that! Synbio education should therefore focus more on educating front-end innovators and contextual engineers, which are the type of engineers that have more eye for stakeholder dialogues and public engagement. Our findings acknowledged that diversity within teams and education is important and required to solve complex problems in the future considering planet, people, profit and processes.4TU CEE found iGEM to form a perfect example of what type of engineers will be necessary in the future considering complex topics such as synthetic biology that bring ethical challenges and knowledge gaps between experts, society and industry.</P><P>We helped them to get insights in how synbio education programmes (and therefore also other engineering programmes)  should develop and we collaborated on solutions to </P><UL class="skel browser-default center-margin"><H class="pink-text"><LI>keep up the leaps and bounds being made in science</LI><LI>not  translate complex but relevant synthetic biology research to society, also engage society</LI><LI>ensure the communication and collaboration between different fields of expertise</LI></H></UL><P>Also, we validated that the roles are a perfect base of the reflection of projects, as we have shown with our workshop developed in collaboration with 4TU CEE.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>This way, future synbio engineers are able to close the gaps between synbio engineers, society and industry, and are the ingredients for a flourishing synbio field. </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Public Engagement</H3><DIV id="engagement-scroll" class="scrollspy"><P>Together with helping other iGEM teams to do integrated human practices and improve the education of engineers in general, we looked to engage the public in showing the possibilities of synthetic biology. “What are we making?” was the main question that led to a diversity of dialogues. Crafting DNA key chains and candy models with young children, parents and elderly was a lovely way to start a conversation about synthetic biology at different events. Craft your own DNA with paracords to make right-handed DNA, and hustle your candy base pairs to write your own DNA sequence. While crafting we taught the public synthetic biology and DNA.</P><BLOCKQUOTE> DNA is like a blueprint, but then instead of building a house you build a person!</BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> DNA is like a recipe your grandma uses to make cookies <CITE> iGEM TU Delft </CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In general perception, DNA is an abstract concept. To show that working with DNA in the lab can be easily copied in the kitchen, we made a video about isolating DNA from fruits.</P></DIV><VIDEO class="responsive-video center-margin" controls=""><P>We thought of an interactive way to explain the characteristics of DNA with keychains and candy. To accompany this, we made a poster that explains the function and characteristics further. *unfoldable of poster when clicking?* ‘From DNA to human’ showed the composition of Gaby, zooming out from DNA to the scale of an actual human being. We explained that cells, such as bacteria, can be used as little factories that produce, break down or detect things. Therefore, bacteria can be used for various purposes, such as bioplastics and biofuels. DNA is used to programme your factory the way you want it to be. Once people understand how DNA modification was related to genetically modified organisms and purposes, dialogues were established and we were able to talk about the potentials, concerns and the future of synthetic biology. 

In addition, we took part in a number of events that encouraged discussions about ethics, potential and concerns about synthetic biology in our local community. The most exciting being the opportunity to give a TEDx talk about synthetic biology and to present our project at the alumni event during the 175th anniversary of the TU Delft! Here is the video of the TEDx talk:</P><VIDEO class="responsive-video center-margin" controls=""><P>A summary of the different events we took part in can be found below.

 Networking Event: Medical Delta Café
</DIV><DIV class="collapsible-body"><P><H7>The Medical Delta Caf é is an event that brings together innovators from the Life Sciences and Health &amp; Technology sectors. Doctors, researchers and entrepreneurs discuss and present opportunities for research cooperation and product development. Here, we pitched our project vision and subsequently hosted a poster session that initiated various dialogues that we can classify in 2 categories:</H7></P></DIV></LI><LI><B>Potential application </B><P>Our detection system can be used to indicate the requirement of alternative treatments. The rise of (multi)resistant bacteria not only triggers a debate about responsible antibiotic usage, but also provides incentive to look for alternative treatment options. We spoke to entrepreneurs and shareholders in a company that provides phage-therapy that is particularly beneficial when antibiotics fail to dispose of a persistent bacterial infection. In this way, our novel detection system can complement phage-therapy and provide a complete workflow to help farmers get rid of a troublesome infection.</P></LI><LI><B>Commercialization</B><P>Several business developers were interested to learn about our innovative approach as a novel synbio application to help solve societally-relevant problems. The first question they ask after the project description is: “What did you do to protect your idea?” Filing a patent, for example, is an important step to secure investment and be able to take the idea to develop the product. In conducting innovative scientific research, teams should also consider legal and business aspects if they wish to take their idea to the market.</P></LI></UL><UL class="collapsible popout"><LI><DIV class="collapsible-header">
 Venture Café
