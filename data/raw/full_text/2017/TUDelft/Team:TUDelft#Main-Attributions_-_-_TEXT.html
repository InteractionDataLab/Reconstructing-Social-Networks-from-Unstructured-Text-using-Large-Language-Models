Team:TUDelft/Main-Attributions
Throughout the past nine months we have received tremendous support from many people, including professors, our instructors, sponsors and experts. This page is dedicated to thank all the people that made our project possible.
Besides those who were part of the team and the department, we couldn’t have done our project without all the stakeholders that made time to sit down with us. They helped us scope our project.
Furthermore, we would like to express our gratitude towards all those who aided us financially. We received many donations and gifts from our sponsors and through our crowdfunding campaign and all are appreciated! We thank you for your trust in us!
