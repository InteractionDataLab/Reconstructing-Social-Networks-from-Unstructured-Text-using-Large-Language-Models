Team:TUDelft/Main-Outreach
During our iGEM project, our team appeared in multiple local newspapers and magazines. With our stories, we aimed to inspire the public about the potential of synthetic biology and educated the public about our project. In addition, we collaborated with the Communication Department of the TU Delft. A  press release and more outreach will follow during the Grand Jamboree.
