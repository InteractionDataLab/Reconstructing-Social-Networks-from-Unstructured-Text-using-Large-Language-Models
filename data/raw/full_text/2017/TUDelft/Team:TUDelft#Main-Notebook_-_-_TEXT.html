Sample prep liquid culture of JW0729
Amária and Fiona
The JW0729 strain was grown overnight in 10 mL LB according to the liquid (starter) culture (10 mL) protocol, in a 50 mL tube. 5 µL         kanamycin was added to the 10 mL LB.
Thursday 15 June
Sample prep plating
Amária and Fiona
We made dilutions of the overnight culture of JW0729 (made on the 14th of June) by prepairing tubes with 900 µL LB, then adding 100 µL of the overnight culture to the first tube, mixing by pipetting and then transferring         100 µL of the mix with a clean pipette to the next tube. We continued until we had a 104 X dilution. We spread out 100 µL of the 10-3 and 10-4 dilutions with a hockeystick plater. The plates         used where made by the pouring agar plates protocol .We let them grow overnight at 37 °C. The used antibiotic was kanamycin.

Final design coacervation method trial 1
Kasper
The full received amount of 10 mg of polyuridylic acid potassium salt (from hereon denoted as polyU) was dissolved in 90 µL of nuclease free water to make a 10 wt% polyU stock solution. This was aliquotted into 15 tubes of 5 µL each and stored at -20 °C.
A 100 mM HEPES solution was made and pH adjusted to pH 7.6 using NaOH.
A 100 mM stock solution of spermidine was received from Christophe Danelon Lab.
Stocks of 1 M and 100 mM MgCl2 were prepared.
Three tubes were prepared in an attempt to form visible coacervates. The first tube contained 5 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM spermidine and 0.05 wt% polyU. The second tube contained 5 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 2 mM MgCl2, 25 mM spermidine and 0.1 wt% polyU. The third tube contained 48 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM spermidine and 0.1 wt% polyU. All three were left at 37 °C for 30 minutes. No increase in turbidity of solution was observed.
Sample prep DNA extraction through heat
Amária and Fiona
We made 7 different concentrations of colonies with 2,1,0.5,0.25,0.125,0.0625 colonies and one with an undifined but high dosage of colonies. We did this by putting 2 colonies (from the plate made on the 20th of June) in 2 mL milli         Q, mixing and then transferring 1 mL to a new tube with 1 mL milliQ. We repeated this until we had 0.0625 of a colony in 1ml. The high dosage we got by scraping an inauculation loop over the plate with colonies and adding this to 1 mL         milli Q. We repeated this to have a duplicate of every concentration. We extracted the DNA of 1 of the duplicates with the microwave method for DNA isolation and the other duplicate with the boiling method. Both are described by this protol: DNA isolation . We measured the DNA concentration with the nanodrop.

Primers IG0010 and IG0011 were dissolved according to the primer working stock preparation protocol. Next, we followed the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol, with 0.5 µL of DNA template (linearized backbone pSB1C3) and 36 µL of milli-Q; Only 1 µL of each of the primers was used. The PCR program was run with an extension time of 2 minutes.
Friday 23 June
To eliminate the effect that other components of the Bibdo I solution could have on the formation of coacervates, the same test was ran with only RNase A. 45 µL solutions (C & D) were prepared as follows
C

Cas13a Backbone preparation
Jeroen and Fiona
Agar plates with ampicillin were prepared according to the agar plate protocol, except only 1 µL per mL of medium was used. Cells with pSB4A5 (low copy number plasmid with ampicillin resistance) were obtained from our supervisor Dominik. The plasmid contains an RFP insert. The cells were plated out and incubated overnight at 37 °C in the stove.
Effect of HEPES concentration on coacervates
Kasper
To examine the effect of the HEPES concentration on the formation of coacervates was tested by preparing coacervates (0.1 wt% polyU, 1 wt% spermine and MilliQ) in six tubes of 50 µL with 0, 10, 20, 50, 75 and 89 mM of HEPES. No significant difference in turbidity (to the naked eye) between each of those tubes was observed, indicating that, at least to the naked eye, the concentration of HEPES does not significantly influence the turbidity of coacervate solutions.

Aafke and Gabriella
Primers IG0023 and IG0022 were dissolved according to the primer working stock preparation protocol.      GFP-TorA and TolR were dissolved according to the gBlock resuspension protocol.      Next, we followed the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol, with 1 µL of DNA template (GFP-TorA and TolR) and 35.5 µL of milli-Q; Only 1 µL of each of the primers was used. The PCR program was run with an extension time of 9 seconds for TolR and 28 seconds for GFP-TorA.
Gel electrophoresis
Aafke and Gabriella
The PCR sample was run on gel according to the DNA electrophoresis protocol.     The result can be seen in the picture below.
The expected band size of GFP-TorA is 1,250 bp. The indicated band in the second lane matches this size. The expected band size of TolR is 564 bp. The bright band in the third lane matches this size. It was decided to purify both fragments from the gel, to get rid of the DNA-fragments with different sizes.

Cas13a Linearization of pSB4A5
Phusion PCR 1
Fiona and Jeroen
The PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed with 5 µL of the midiprepped sample from 29-06-2017. Primers IG0010 and IG0011 were used. Annealing temperatures of 55 and 60 °C were tried out. The extension time was set at 1 minute. The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol), which was run for 35 minutes.
It was concluded from the gel that the PCR was not successful. Faint bands are visible around 4,000 bp, which is too large. The expected size of the linearized backbone was 3395 bp. It was concluded that the bands are most likely caused by the circular template DNA.A new PCR was necessary.
Phusion PCR 2 (with DMSO)
Fiona
The Phusion PCR ( PCR (Phusion polymerase) ) was repeated with more template DNA (5 µL). Two samples using the midiprepped backbone and two samples using the PCR product as template DNA were prepared. For each template, one sample was run with DMSO and one without. Again the products were checked on gel ( DNA electrophoresis ).
The two PCR products (with and without DMSO) have a band of the correct size only, while the midiprepped samples have resulted in by-products.
Spermine dependence of spermine/polyU coacervates
Kasper
How the concentration of spermine affects the turbidity of spermine/polyU coacervates, was determined using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek) in the Stan Brouns lab. Wells were filled with varying concentrations of spermine and polyU and the absorbance of 500 nm light was tracked over the course of 30 minutes. This is still a preliminary experiment to get familiarized with the method.
Six wells of 50 µL were prepared containing 0.1 wt% polyU, 20 mM HEPES and varying concentrations of spermine (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 wt%) in milliQ. Furthermore a blank was prepared containing only 20 mM HEPES and milliQ.
After inserting the plate into the platereader 37 °C, the samples were left for 5 minutes to equilibriate temperature and then the absorbance of 500 nm light was measured every minute.
Sample prep DNA electrophoresis of Digested samples
Amária
We performed the DNA electrophoresis protocol for a 0.8 % agarose gel. We mixed 3 µL loading buffer with 15 µL sample (from the digestion     on the 27th of June) on parafilm. 6 µL 1kb benchtop ladder was used. We ran the gel at 100V for 40 min.The following picture shows the resulting DNA gel:

*For comparison, the negative control plate (Gibson assembly mix without an insert, transformed in TOP10) had four colonies. The number of positive colonies on the transformed plates is thus relatively low (except for gene 6). The picked colonies were checked by colony PCR, following the colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol. However, the PCR program was run with an annealing temperature of 53 °C instead of 55 °C, because a pre-set program was used. The extension time was set to be 60 seconds for all the genes.

Cas13a PCR product purification
Jeroen
The two PCR products that were amplified from the previous PCR product were added together and purified according to the PCR product purification (Promega Wizard SV™ Kit) protocol.
Thorough spermine dependence of spermine/polyU coacervates
Kasper
To more thoroughly examine the dependence of turbidity caused by coacervation on the spermine concentration, solutions of 100 µL were prepared containing 20 mM HEPES 0.05 wt% polyU and varying concentrations of spermine (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0) wt%. Also a blank was prepared containing only milliQ. All wells were mixed by gentle pipetting, and subsequently 50 µL of each well was taken out and pipetted into another well to make technical duplicates. The temperature in the platereader was set at 27 °C and all wells were left to equilibriate temperature for five minutes. Then for 5 minutes the absorbance of 500 nm light was measured every minute. After two such rounds, the platereader was set to shake the samples for 1 minute and the protocol was repeated including the equilibriation step.
Colony PCR gel and new colony PCR
Colony PCR gel
Guillermo, Isabell and Kelly
We followed the DNA electrophoresis protocol for the amplified samples. The results for 14 out of the 18 samples are displayed below.
The expected band size is around 1,150 bp, as the used primers add an extra ~160 bp to the insert size. In every lane, two bands are present around this size. It is unclear if either of these is insert, or that both of them are an undesired amplified product. However, the negative control that was run by Aafke and Gabriella (Vesicles module) also shows these two bands, while there should not be an insert present in this sample. It was therefore decided to screen more colonies, especially since more colonies were now visible on the plates.

Cas13a Cleaning and concentration of the backbone
Fiona and Jeroen
The cleaned PCR products from 03-07-2017 were added together and DpnI digested DpnI digestion in 70 µL in total (only 1 µL of milli-Q and 7 µL of CutSmart buffer were used). The resulting sample was again purified ( PCR product purification (Promega Wizard™ Kit) ) and NanoDropped ( DNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop) ). The concentration was determined to be 79.71 ng/µL.
RNase Titration
Kasper
First the following stock solutions of RNase A (ThermoFisher, 12091021): 2 wt%, 0.2 wt% 0.02 wt%, 0.002 wt%.
Seven solutions of 100 µL were prepared, each containing 20 mM HEPES, 0.05 wt% polyU, 0.5 wt% spermine and varying amounts of RNase A (0, 10-5, 10-4, 10-3, 10-2 and 10-1 wt%) in nuclease free water, and mixed by gentle pipetting. Also a blank was prepared containing only 20 mM HEPES and nuclease free water. Subsequently 50 µL was taken out of each prepared well and pipetted into another well to make technical duplicates. Then the samples were equilibriated for 5 minutes at 27 °C and the absorbance (500 nm) was measured over 30 minutes every 2 minutes.
TDPs Colony PCR gel
Guillermo and Kelly
We followed the DNA electrophoresis protocol for the product of colony PCR of colonies that were picked on 03-08-2017 (except for the very last one, 6.8).
The gel shows a DNA ladder and 19 out of the 20 new colonies (in ascending order) that were picked (only 6.8 is not shown). 45 PCR cycles was too many; unspecific binding results have now been amplified too much. Some of the bands seem to be of the right size (~1,000 bp), but it is very hard to conclude anything from this gel. Due to the unspecifity of the primers, it was decided to miniprep the colonies that were transformed with gene 1 (CAHS_94205_2) and test them with digestion assays.
Vesicles Colony PCR
Colony PCR
Aafke and Gabriella
The 5 picked colonies of TolR of the second transformation and the additional 5 picked colonies of GFP-TorA of the first transformation were checked by colony PCR, following the colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol.      The first step was set to be 2.5 minute. The extension time was set to be 2 minutes. The result can be seen in the picture below.
No bands can be seen on this gel, indicating that there was not enough DNA to run the PCR-reaction on. Based on this gel, we decided to change the first step of the colony PCR protocol to 5 minutes, to boil the bacteria.
GFP-TorA plates
Aafke and Gabriella
To be able to select for the right insert, we decided to select for GFP activity. The result can be seen in the picture below.
No GFP activity was detected. Colony 2 was grown in a liquid culture overnight according to the liquid (starter) culture (10 mL) protocol.

Cas13a Gibson assembly 1
Jeroen, Kelly and Guillermo
The gBlock resuspension protocol was followed for theresuspension of part_1, part_2 and the gene_art_spacer (50 ng/µL). Furthermore, before the Gibson assembly, the purified backbone was checked on gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol).
Since the backbone looks to be fine, the Gibson assembly ( Gibson assembly protocol) was started. The information about the sizes and volumes of the parts (1:3 ratio of vector to inserts) can be found in the table below.

NOTE: because the total volume of the sample would exceed 20 µL if the volumes above were added, the 'DNA mix' with the backbone and the three inserts was partially evaporated to a volume of approximately 5 µL. A control (without any of the inserts) was also incubated. The Gibson mix was transformed in chemically competent Dh5α cells according to the transformation of chemical competent cells protocol.

Cas13a Transformation 1 results
Fiona and Jeroen
The plates with the transformed cells contained a lot of satellite colonies*. Below one of the four plates as an example.
The control plates where also covered with colonies, that were assumed to be non-digested backbone. It was therefore decided to do the transformation again.
*In hindsight this is due to the too low concentration of ampicillin that was used, but we were not aware of this at that time.

A digestion assay was carried out using PstI and EcoRI in CutSmart buffer, following the digestion assay protocol.
The fragments between 1,000 and 1,250 bp match the expected band size for the insert. The bands around 2,000 bp match the expected size for the backbone fragments. It remained unclear why the insert bands were brighter than the backbone bands. It was decided to send the miniprepped sample from colonies 1.2-1.4 for sequencing. These samples were prepared according to the sequencing sample (Macrogen) protocol, with the exception that we only aimed at ~200 ng of DNA. Primer IG0012 was used.

Cas13a Transformation 2 results and backbone optimization
Transformation 2 results
Fiona and Jeroen
The plates were again full of colonies, although not satellite colonies this time. One of the four plates is displayed as an example below.
There were many colonies on both the plates with the inserts and without. The control plates should however be empty, since the DpnI digestion should have cleared the solution with pSB4A5 from all the circular template plasmids. However, the gel from 05-07-2017 has a fat band, indicating the presence of a lot of DNA. This might have caused the DpnI digestion to fail. Therefore, it was decided to pick two times 96 colonies and screen them. Additionally, the backbone PCR and the Gibson assembly should be repeated with less DNA template.
Backbone PCR
Fiona and Jeroen
The Phusion PCR ( PCR (Phusion polymerase) ) was repeated with less template DNA (1 µL). The annealing temperature was set to be 57 °C and the extension time was 105 seconds. DNA electrophoresis resulted in the following gel:
The PCR product (2nd lane) was of the correct size and was thus purified ( PCR product purification ), DpnI digested , purified again and NanoDropped . The concentration of the final product was determined to be 8.52 ng/µL.
TDPs New sequencing samples
Preparation of sequencing samples
Guillermo
The results from the sequencing samples from 06-07-2017 came back in. However, the chromatograms were of very bad quality. This could be due to either the lower concentration of DNA or a bad sequencing primer (IG0012). Therefore, the samples 1.2-1.4 were prepared again, following the the sequencing sample (Macrogen) protocol. We used both the forward (IG0012) and the backward primer (IG0013) for these three samples, making six samples in total.

TDPs Sequencing results and conclusions
Guillermo, Isabell and Kelly
The chromatograms of the samples with the forward primer (IG0012) were of very bad quality, indicating that this primer is not suitable as a sequencing primer for backbone pSB1C3. The chromatograms of the samples with primer IG0013 were of better quality, but they showed the insert is absent in all three samples. The sequencing results did however indicate an extra (forbidden) PstI and EcorI restriction site in the sequence of colony 1.3 and 1.2, respectively. This (partially) explains the results obtained with the gel on 06-07-2017, as the backbone is thus cut in two halves of approximately 1,000 bp.

The insert should give a band at ~1250 bp. We found out that the primers used weren't optimal, explaining these non-matching results.

TDPs Backbone check and digestion assays
Guillermo, Isabell and Kelly
Based on the sequencing results from 12-07-2017, we wanted to ensure that the backbone in our PCR product was not mutated. Therefore, the two PCR samples from 27-06-2017 and 28-06-2017 were both NanoDropped according to the NanoDrop protocol. The miniprepped samples from colonies 3.1-3.4 and 6.1-6.4 were NanoDropped in the same manner. These genes (colonies) were chosen as the plates of these genes had the most colonies and thus the highest chance of a correct clone. The NanoDrop results are displayed in the table below.

The backbone samples (PCR 1 and PCR 2) were digested with PstI; the other samples (gene 3 and 6) were digested with both PstI and EcoRI. The samples were prepared according to the digestion assay protocol, with samples of 20 µL total. The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol).
It is unclear what happened to the gel. Nevertheless, no conclusions could be drawn from this result. The digestion of the miniprepped samples and the gel electrophoresis were repeated by our supervisor Sebastian, leading to the gel results below.
From this gel, it could be concluded that all samples contained an intact backbone (~2,000 bp, the red band). However, none of the samples contained the insert (~1,000 bp). Therefore, it was concluded to do the Gibson assembly again.
Vesicles Colony PCR
Floor and Gabriella
As we found out that the primers weren't optimal for our DNA-template, we did the colony PCR again with primers IG0022 and IG0013 ( colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol). However, no bands could be seen on the gel.

Colony picking
Jasper and Jeroen
96 colonies were picked from the 2nd round of transformation (10-07-2017). This was done as described in the first steps of the colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol, but then for many samples at once (using two 96-wells plates).

Transformation
Jeroen
Another transformation with Gibson assembly mix 2 (from 13-07-2017) was carried out. Chemical competent TOP10 cells that were prepared during the lab training week were used. The cells were plated out on ampicillin plates that were prepared 12-07-2017.
TDPs Backbone amplification
Guillermo and Kelly
To ensure that the backbone used in the Gibson assembly was correct and to get more of the backbone, we did another round of backbone amplification. We used a sample containing pSB1C3 with RFP insert from the 2010 team. It was called CsgA-HA. The PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was carried out, with an annealing temperature of 57 °C and an extension time of 1 minute. Next, the PCR purification and the DpnI digestion protocol were executed. After the digestion, the sample was again purified and run on gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol).
The band around 2,000 bp (red-lined rectangle) in lane 2 and 3 is very vague, but nonetheless indicates product of the correct size. Therefore, it was decided that this sample could be used for Gibson assembly. The concentration of the sample was determined ( NanoDrop protocol) to be 167 ng/µL.

Cas13a Colony PCR and digestion Gootenberg plasmid
Colony PCR
Jasper and Jeroen
The colonies that were picked first (14-07-2017; 96-wells plate) were used as a template in colony PCR (GoTaq) with primers IG0022 and IG0023. Additionally, in the same round of colony PCR 8 colonies from the third transformation (14-07-2017) were used. The results are displayed in the agarose gel photos below.
In the results, we should be seeing a product of around 4000 base pairs. This is clearly not the case. After a discussion with a supervisor, we realised that the geneArt fragment came in circulairzed form, and we had not linearized it before the Gibson assembly. This explains why the experiment was not successful.
Restriction Digestion
Jeroen
The Gootenberg plasmid was used as the template in a double digestion with enzymes XhoI and XbaI. We used the digestion assay protocol . The result was visualised on a agarose gel as shown below.

Both digested and non-digested samples display the same bands. It might be that the restriction enzymes didn't work.
Check restriction enzymes
Aafke and Floor
To check the activity of the used restriction enzymes, we were provided with a sample (pBH), which was digested with XbaI and NdeI. If both restriction enzymes worked, we would get the following bands:
-5365 bp
-3673 bp
-1231 bp
-241 bp
-164 bp
-33 bp
The sample was prepared according to the digestion assay protocol, with 25 µL total.     The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol). The result can be seen in the picture below.
NdeI worked for sure. Based on this gel we cannot conclude if XbaI is still active, so we decided to use NdeI and SphI for the next digestion.

TDPs Backbone (and GFP) amplification
Kelly
The colonies from yesterday were still very small. Therefore, colony picking was postponed until Wednesday 19-07-2017. Due to the vesicle module changing tactics from Gibson assembly to restriction-ligation, they needed more pSB1C3. Therefore, another backbone amplification was carried out. The same steps as on 14-07-2017 were followed; PCR (Phusion polymerase) with an annealing temperature of 57 °C and an extension time of 1 minute; PCR purification and DpnI digestion ; purification and DNA electrophoresis . The GFP insert was amplified at the same time, but this was done by the vesicle module themselves. The agarose gel shows the expected band (~2 kbp) for 3 out of the 4 prepared samples, so the deviating sample was thrown away.

Aafke and Floor
The digested sample was loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol).      The result can be seen on the picture below.
No clear bands are visible for the TolR-AU sample, meaning that the plasmid is not yet verified.
Amplification of pSB1C3 and GFP-TorA
Aafke and Floor
We followed the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol.      For GFP-TorA 1µL of DNA template was used and 1µL of the primers IG0023 and IG0022.      0.5 µL of pSB1C3 was used together with 1 µL of the primers IG0010 and IG0011.      The PCR program was run with an extension time of 28 seconds for GFP-TorA and 60 seconds for pSB1C3.
The PCR sample was run on gel according to the DNA electrophoresis protocol.     The result can be seen in the picture below (with lane 5 and 7 empty).
As no other bands are significantly visible on the gel, both GFP-TorA and pSB1C3 are pure enough to be purified from the PCR mixture itself. Only #2 of pSB1C3 is discarded.

Jeroen
To amplify part 1, primers IG0029 and IG0022 were used. For part 2, primers IG0030 and IG0031 were used. The Phusion PCR protocol was followed.
Results and discussion
An agarose gel was made to visualise the result, as shown below. In the first lane we see part 1 and in the second lane we see part 2. The sizes are not what we would expect, so we concluded the PCR to be unsuccesful. We decided to adjust the Tm to 55° and the extension time to 1.5 minutes.

Amplification of parts 1, 2 and the GeneArt spacer
Phusion PCR
Jeroen
The PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed with: 1 µL of C6 (a 1 µg/µL dilution of the part1), 1 µL of C7 (a 1 µg/µL dilution of the part2) and 1 µL of C8 (a 1 µg/µL dilution of the GeneArt spacer). Primers IG0022 and IG0029 were used for C6, primers IG0030 and IG0031 were used for C7 and primers IG0032 and IG0023 were used for C8. Annealing temperatures of 55  °C were used for all templates. The extension time was set at 1 minute and 30 seconds for templates C6 and C7 and 20 seconds for template C8. The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol), which was run for 50 minutes.
It was concluded from the gel that the PCR amplification of the GeneArt spacer was succesful since it the gel shows a thick band above the 250 bp, which corresponds with the expected 304 bp. Furthermore the PCR product of C7 shows three bands: one clear band around 1500 bp, which corresponds with the expected 1608 bp, one faint band below the 1500 bp and one band at 1000 bp. The latter two could be a product of aspecific binding of the primers. Also a smear is present. Increasing the annealing temperature could increase the binding specificity and might result in a better result. At last, we concluded that the PCR amplification of C6 failed. Optimizing the annealing temperature could solve this problem. The new annealing temperature for C6 and C7 were calculated with the NEB Tm calculator . The new annealing temperaturs are:
For C6 (part1): 72 °C
For C7 (part2): 62 °C
TDPs Colony PCR check and new colony PCR
Colony PCR check
Isabell and Kelly
An agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol) was run to check the colony PCR's from yesterday.
The expected size without an insert was 261 bp. A band of this size is visible in the lane with the negative control (x1) and a lot of the other lanes. The expected size for gene 1-4 was ~1,200 bp and for gene 5-6 ~1,000 bp. A band of this size is present in some of the lanes. Therefore, the following colonies were grown in a liquid culture ( liquid (starter) culture (10 mL) protocol): 1.5, 3.2, 3.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.5-6.8.

50 µL TOP10 cells that were made competent during the iGEM practice week were transformed with 15 µL of GFP-TorA plasmid according to      the transformation of chemical competent cells protocol.      The cells were plated out on chloramphenicol plates.
Friday 21 July
Amplification of parts 1 and 2 and cleaning the PCR product of the GeneArt spacer
Cleaning and concentration of the GeneArt spacer
Jeroen
The PCR product of the GeneArt spacer from 20-07-2017 is DpnI digested DpnI digestion in an total volume of 40 μL (7 μL CutSmart buffer, 1 μL milli-Q and 2 μL DpnI). The product was purified following the PCR product purification (Promega Wizard SV™ Kit) protocol . The purified sample was NanoDropped ( DNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop) ) and labelled as C11. The concentration was 49.04 ng/μL with a 260/280 ratio of 2.63. This ratio is higher than desirable, so we decided to repeat the purification step and measure the concentration again ( DNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop) ). This time the concetration of C11 is 39.87 ng/μL with a 260/280 ratio of 1.67, which is better.
Phusion PCR
Jeroen
The PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed with: 1 µL of the PCR product of C6 from 20-07-2017 (part1) and the PCR product of C7 from 20-07-2017 (part2). Primers IG0022 and IG0029 were used for part1 and primers IG0030 and IG0031 were used for part2. Two gradients were used for the annealing temperatures:
For part1:
65 °C
70 °C
72 °C
For part2:
55 °C
62 °C
65 °C
The extension time was set at 1 minute and 45 seconds. The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol), which was run for 50 minutes.
The gradient was for both part not a succes. While the PCR on part1 gave no result at all, there is a faint band at the right height for part 2, but it is still not really specific.

Colony PCR gel and discussion
Isabell and Kelly
It can be concluded from this gel (for expected sizes, see 20-07-2017 entry) that only 5.13 is a positive clone. Furthermore, clones 1.3, 1.4, 5.4 and 3.6 did not show any bands at all. Therefore, it was decided to check these on gel again. Moreover, since there were no new positive clones for gene 1, 2 and 3, more colonies were picked.

The PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed for amplifying part1 and part2. For part1 1 µL of C6 is used with primers IG0022 and IG0029. We used a gradient for the annealing temperature with three tubes (65 °C, 70 °C and 72 °C). The used extension time is 1 minute and 45 seconds and instead of repeating steps 2-4 30 times, it is only repeated 12 times. For part2 1 µL of C7 is used with primers IG0030 and IG0031. We used a gradient for the annealing temperature with three tubes (55 °C, 57 °C and 62 °C). The used extension time is 1 minute and 45 seconds and steps 2-4 is repeated 30 times. The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol), which was run for 50 minutes.
P1 and P2 stand for part1 and part2. The number that follows is the used annealing temperature. There are bands on the right heights for part1 (~2500 bp) and part2 (~1600 bp), however on the lanes from part1 we can see a second fainter band at around 2000 bp. We decided to gel isolate P1 65 and P1 70 from the gel. P2 55, P2 57 and P2 62 can cleaned immediately.

No growth on the plates of the tranformation of GFP-TorA in TOP10 cells.
Two ligated samples of GFP-TorA were again transformed, but this time in commercial available NEB5-α competent cells following the transformation of chemical competent cells protocol.     However, the heat-shock was 30 seconds and after the heatshock the cells were stored on ice for 5 minutes before adding the enriched SOC-medium.
Digestion GFP-TorA & pSB1C3
Aafke and Floor
In case the transformation didn't work, a new digestion ligation step is required before we can transform again. For this purpose we initiated a digestion of GFP-TorA and pSB1C3 with EcoRI and PstI according to the digestion assay protocol, with samples of 50 µL total.The sample was incubated at room temperature overnight.

Aafke and Floor
The primers used were IG0006 and IG0013, with an annaeling temperature of 55 °C. The 10 picked colonies of GFP-TorA were checked by colony PCR, following the colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol.      The first step was set to be 1 minute. The extension time was set to be 2 minutes. The result can be seen in the picture below.
The primers anneal 260 bp around the insert and the insert has a size of 1250 bp, making the expected band size around 1500 bp. All colonies except the control and the blank display this band. L1.2 and L1.3 were inoculated in 5 mL of LB to grow overnight.

New plan for assembling the cas13 construct
The Amp plates containing transformed cell from 27-07-2017 has no colonies. Conclusion: the Gibson assembly and/or transformation was unsuccesful.
Gel electrophoresis of Becca's PCR
Jeroen and Fiona
The samples were loaded on an agarose gel ( DNA electrophoresis protocol), which was run for 50 minutes.
BB stands for backbone (psB4A5) and P1 stands for part1. There are clear bands for part1, so we decided to proceed with the purifiction of the PCR product. The psB4A5 amplification was less succesful.
Cleaning and concentration of part1
Fiona and Jeroen
The cleaned PCR products of part1 from 27-07-2017 were added together and DpnI digested DpnI digestion in 70 µL in total (only 1 µL of milli-Q and 7 µL of CutSmart buffer were used). The resulting sample was again purified ( PCR product purification (Promega Wizard™ Kit) ) in a total volume of 20 μL and NanoDropped ( DNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop) ). The concentration was determined to be 358 ng/µL with an 260/280 ratio of 1.84. The tube is lablled as C26.

New plan for assembling the cas13a construct: Plan A and Plan B
Jeroen and Fiona
we designed a new approach for assembling our construct, since the Gibson assemblies and transformations kept failling. Both plans consist of a serie of Gibson assemblies that will create the construct step by step. The difference between the two aproaches lies in the order in which some parts are assembled. See below for a schematic overview of both approaches.
For these assemblies new primers had been ordered (IG0035-IG0050). The primers are designed in SnapGene by doing virtual Gibson Assemblies. We worked as follows:

Isabell and Kelly
By adding 20 mL of 100 mM HEPES buffer, 19.6 mL milliQ and 0.4 mL of 5M NaCl, 40 mL of 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl buffer was prepared. The cell pellets stored at -20 °C the previous day (27-07-2017) were resuspended in the HEPES/NaCl buffer and then prepared for SDS-PAGE following the SDS-PAGE for precast gels protocol. The samples were loaded in undiluted and diluted form (5x in sample buffer) and the marker used for the gel was Precision Plus Protein™ Unstained (#161-0363).
Transformation of SAHS plasmids into BL21AI
To have a tighter control on expression of the two SAHS genes, both SAHS plasmids were transformed into a BL21 AI strain. The BL21AI strain was plated on 27-07-2017 and the transformation followed the following protocol.
Pick three colonies of BL21 AI, inoculate in SOB medium and incubate in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 3.5 hours.
Centrifuge cells at 15000 g for 10 min. Discard supernatant.
Resuspend cells in 1 mL of milliQ, wash with 25 mL milliQ and centrifuge at 15000 g for 10 min
Repeat washing procedure with milliQ.
Resuspend cells in 1 mL of glycerol and keep on ice.
Mix 1 mL plasmid solution and 100 µL cells in a sterile microcentrifuge tube and incubate on ice for 30 min.
Transfer mixture into an electroporation cuvette and pulse.
Immediately add SOC medium to the cuvettes and transfer to another sterile microcentrifuge tube.
Incubate cells in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 60 min, and plate undiluted and in 10x and 100x dilutions.
The plates were left in the stove at 37 °C, taken out the following day (29-07-17) and moved to the fridge.

Both the GFP-sequence and the TorA-sequence allign perfectly. However, some mismatches were found at the beginning of the sequence in the prefix and the Lac-promoter.
To be able to verify the sequence of the Lac-promoter and the prefix, L1.2 was prepared again for sequencing following the sequencing sample (Macrogen) protocol.      This time we were provided with the reverse primer BN156 that anneals on GFP.
Transformation TolR-AU
Aafke and Floor
The transformation was succesful, growth on all the plates as expected.

Colony picking and colony PCR of transformed colonies
The plates with the transformed cells from 28-07-2017 looked as follows:
This is not the desired result, since ther are way more colonies on the control plate then on the insert plates. This could indicate that there is a lot of "background noise" consisting of empty self ligated backbones. We decided to still pick some colonies from the insert plates to check if there were some good colonies with colony PCR.
Colony picking
Kasper and Jeroen
We picked 20 colonies from the insert plates from 28-09-2017 where 20 μL, 100 μL and the rest of the transformed were plated following the colony picking protocol.
Colony PCR
Jeroen
A colony PCR was done on the 20 picked colonies following the colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol. Primers IG0007 and IG0006 were used (IG0007 was resuspended and a working stock was made). We made postive control by addind 2 μL C1 (psB4A5) to the GoTaq mix. As annealing temperature (calculated with the NEB Tm calculator ) we set 52 °C with an extension time of 45 seconds. Step 2-4 was repeated 35 times.
Culture Preparation and Sequencing Results and Conclusions
Preparation of Starter Cultures for Protein Purification
Guillermo, Isabell and Kelly
50 mL cultures were inoculated with two BL21(DE3) colonies of 1.5 (further referred to as B1) and two BL21(AI) colonies of 5.1 (further referred to as A5). They will be used for protein production and SDS-PAGE. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the shaking incubator (~150 rpm).

For the samples of GFP-TorA in WT and in KEIO a coverglass was prepared for Widefield microscopy following the Preparing coverglass for microscope protocol.
The following picture was obtained for GFP-TorA in WT .
The following pictures were obtained for GFP-TorA in KEIO.
You can clearly see a difference in the morphology of KEIO compared to the WT. The KEIO-cells are longer and might even appaer filamentous. Above that, growth and protein production seems to be impaired, leading to less GFP-activity and less but longer cells.

The plasmid isolation (PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep System) protocol was followed. The plasmid isolation was done on two an overnight culture that was made the day before (5 mL LB medium with 5 μL Amp) from the colonies that were picked on 31-07-2017 (sample 9 and 10). The purified samples were NanoDropped ( DNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop) ) and labelled.

5 g of IPTG was received from Anna (Stan Brouns lab) and a stock solution with a concentration of 500 mM was made. For this purpose, 1.2 g of IPTG was dissolved in 10 mL of milli-Q and subsequently filtered through 0.2 µm. The IPTG was stored at -20 °C.
In the afternoon, after approximately five hours, the OD600 of the cultures was found slightly above 0.6, so expression was induced by addition of 1 mL of IPTG solution. Subsequently, cultures were put in the shaking incubator (18 , 180 rpm) overnight.
Protein Purification (Day 0) and Preparation of Purification Samples for SDS-PAGE
Protein Purification (Day 0)
Guillermo
A new purification with the colonies 3.5, 4.6 and 6.2 (B3, B4 and A6, respectively) following the TDP purification protocol (Day 0) was performed, with the exception of induction of A6 with 10 mL arabinose in addition to the standard induction with IPTG. All cultures were induced when they reached the exponential growth phase (B3 and A6 at OD = =0.55 and B4 at OD = 0.54).
N.B.: The induction of the 1 L cultures was not adjusted to the starter culture OD, instead they were simply induced with 12 mL of the culture medium.
Pouring of SDS-PAGE gel
Guillermo
A 12 % gel was poured following the protocol for pouring a SDS-PAGE gel .

For the samples of GFP-TorA in WT and in KEIO a coverglass was prepared for Widefield microscopy following the Preparing coverglass for microscope protocol.
The following picture was obtained for GFP-TorA in WT .
The following pictures were obtained for GFP-TorA in KEIO.
You can clearly see a difference in the morphology of KEIO compared to the WT. The KEIO-cells are longer and might even appaer filamentous. Above that, growth and protein production seems to be impaired, leading to less GFP-activity and less but longer cells.

To obtain the empty backbone pET-Duet1 without the TolR-fragment, the backbone will be amplified following the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol, with 1 µL of DNA template (TolR-AU) and 35.5 µL of milli-Q; Only 1 µL of each of the primers (IG0051 and IG0052) was used. The PCR program was run with an extension time of 81 seconds for TolR-AU.
The PCR sample was run on gel according to the DNA electrophoresis protocol.     The result can be seen in the picture below (with 1 and 2 being the empty backbone and B the blank).
The gel was run again and the indicated band was cut out of the gel.

We performed the RNA electrophoresis protocol.We used the high range riboruler from Thermo Fisher, so we used 2 µL ladder with 2 µL loading dye. we put the samples and ladder at 70 °C for 10 min and imediately transfered to ice for 5 min.We prepaired a 1 % agarose gel. We ran it at 80V for 40 min.The following picture shows the resulting RNA gel:
We took 1 µL RNA and diluted it with 9 µL nuclease free water, this was measured with the the nanodrop following the RNA concentration measurement (NanoDrop) protocol.The concentration was 45.2 ng/ µL, so the stock solution had a concentration of 452 ng/ µL. We adden 10 µL RNA to 45,2 µL nuclease free water for a 100 ng/ µL working stock. Then we aliquoted the RNA for further use into 5 tubes of 11 µL.

Cas13a elution
Kasper
The supernatant of the Streptactin resin was run through FPLC (AKTA) and subsequently eluted over a NaCl gradient of elution buffer. The elution buffer consisted of 20 mM TRIS-HCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol and 0-2 M NaCl.
There was no elution of Cas13a, indicating that the protein was probably never really bound to the column. To check this hypothesis, the initial flowthrough was loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.
Lane 2 again contains the supernatant of the resin. Lane 3 contains the flowthrough from the FPLC.
The flowthrough was centrifuged over a filter (100 kDa, 4 °C, 3220
x
) in rounds of 20 minutes each until all flowthrough was filtered. The resulting solution was stored in a tube labelled "1608 flowthrough filtered" and stored for the next SDS-PAGE gel.
Two colonies from the BL21(DE3) cells in which the Zhang lab plasmid was transformed were plated on fresh plates.

Cas13 amplification of 'P1-P2-Sp'
Amplification
Kelly
Since it seemed that indeed the right primers were used, it was more likely that #8 from 14/08/2017 was in fact the P1-P2-Spacer insert complete with prefix and suffix. The PCR product at least had the right size. Therefore, this part was amplified in two parallel PCRs.
PCR programme 1: Used primers IG0006 and IG0007. Expected size of product: 4500 bp. Tm used: 63.5°C.
PCR programme 2: Used primers IG0022 and IG0023. Expected size of product: 4350 bp. Tm used: 72°C.
Furthermore, the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed.
Results: For both primer sets the sample containing DMSO (lane 3 and 5) gives a more specific result than the sample without DMSO. Primer set IG0006 and IG0007 seems to give a more specific result. Conclusion: sample should be gel extracted.
Gel Isolation
Kelly
The remainder of C45 was loaded on gel (~21uL + 3.5uL loading dye). It was cut from gel and purified. Finally, the concentration was measured on the Nanodrop, yielding a concentration of 4.76 ng/uL. The gel used was an 0.6% agarose gel.
PCR amplificication
Kelly
Both the gel extracted sample and the PCRed samples with and without DMSO and primers IG00006-IG0007 were used as template for another round of PCR. For this PCR, the same programsas before were used ( PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol ). We used GC buffer and DMSO for all reactions. The following templates and primers were used:

The samples were very diluted (for "8"), but at least they had a vague of the right size (even though only 0.4 μL was used as template).
All samples were purified (from another gel).

Cas13 PCR amplifications of the plasmid and the insert
This day we decided on a different strategy: we decided to do the whole plasmid PCR again, but in more tubes, so we could perform a gel extraction.
In parallel, we decided to run a Taq amplification of the insert (on the Gibson assembly mix) to produce a high yield of product. If this works, we could then ligate the product to the pGEM cloning plasmid, so we can sequence properly.
Phusion PCR
Fiona
The PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed. Instead of HF-buffer we used GC-buffer and DMSO.
As template we used the Gibson assembly mix with the primers IG0055 and IG0056.The used annealing temperature was 66 °C with an extension time of 231 seconds.
Three tubes were made from i1 and 3 of i2.
GoTaq PCR
Fiona
The Colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol was followed.
For the template C48 was used (purified PCR product of "8". Primers IG0053 and IG0054 were used. A gradient was used for the annealing temperature with 10 tubes in total:
50 °C
51 °C
52 °C

The extension time was set to 4.5 minutes.
Both the products from the Phusion PCR and the products from the GoTaq PCR were load on an agaros gel and ran for 45 mintues ( DNA electrophoresis )
The whole plasmid PCR did not work. We will try it again with a diluted template.
The Taq amplification of the insert did work, but there is a big smear. We will try it again with diluted template and DMSO to enahnce the specificity.

Cas13 colony PCR
Colony PCR
Fiona
From the plates with colonies, 50 colonies were picked and a colony PCR was done following the colony PCR (GoTaq) protocol . Primers IG0053 and IG0054 were used. The annealing temperature was 49 °C and the extension time was 4.5 minutes.
The results are displayed in the agarose gel photos below.
The PCR seemed unsuccessful. We decided to do a double digest, to see if we could confirm the presence of the plasmid. We used the restriction enzymes XbaI and SpeI, which could cut the gene out, resulting in bands of around 3,000 bp and 4,500 bp.

Making crDNA
Kasper
We prepared primer stock solutions of DNA oligo's IG0057-IG0063 in nuclease-free water. Next, 10 tubes were prepared, each containing 8 µL of nuclease-free. Five contained the T7 promoter (IG0057) and a target. The other five contained the T7 promoter ligated to the hairpin complement (IG0058). All tubes were then annealed according to the crDNA annealing protocol from Christobal (Stan Brouns lab) so that the target sequences bound to their T7 promoter (and optionally the hairpin).
After annealing, an 8% acrylamide gel was ran to confirm annealing. Specifications of this gel were: 330 V, 500 mA, 45 minutes, SYBR gold staining.

Tuesday 5 September
In vitro transcription of crDNA
Kasper
All ten tubes were in vitro transcribed using the following procedure:
The remaining liquid in each tube was incubated with 0.5 µL of each of the nucleotides ATP/GTP/UTP/CTP; 1 µL Murine RNase Inhibitor; 5 µL 1x Rna Polymerase buffer; 1 µL T7 polymerase mix; 36 µL nuclease free water. Incubation took place at 37 °C for 3 hours. Subsequntly, all tubes except for the ones of target 5 (5) and target 5 wih the hairpin (5H) were frozen at -80 °C. The tubes of 5 and 5H were cleaned up using an RNA MinElute kit. The resulting 14 µL of presumably clean RNA was measured in the Nanodrop and values around 20 ng/µL were obtained. Of both, 3 µL was loaded on an RNA gel.
Sample prep RPA with in vitro transcription on samples from our microwave DNA extraction method
Amária and Kasper
We did recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) on the DNA extracted with the microwave method from the dilution serie duplicate #1 with different concentrations of PSB1T3 in DH5-alpha made on the 4th of August. We followed the RPA + in vitro transcription protocol. We made a matermix for 6 samples so multiplied all the ingredients by 7. We added 3,95 µL of Target DNA to the reaction mix and no Milli Q. We used forward primer IG0016 and reverse primer IG0017. We purified the RNA by following the RNA clean and concentrate (Qiagen RNeasy MinElute clean up kit) protocol.While doing the RNA clean up, during step 8 of the kit, the pipette tip fell into the column in sample 10-3, a small drop fell off, but not in the middle. We pipetted 14 µL more into the center of the column.

Wednesday 6 September
crRNA check
Kasper
To check the compound loaded on the RNA gel yesterday (05-09-2017), an assay was done with both RNase A and DNase I. Firstly, a stock soltion of 0.02 wt% DNase I was made by taking 80 µL nuclease-free water and 20 µL of 1 wt% DNase I solution. Nevertheless, this was a miscalculatin, as actually only 2 µL should have been taken. However, for the assay this does not matter.
The following six solutions were made:

LDH assay (controls)
Gabriella, Guillermo
Samples for an LDH assay were prepared for the proteins B3 and A5 in concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 g/L. The LDH assay was then carried out for the half of the samples that was not to be dried.
NB: Instead of 1 µL of LDH-TDP solution, as stated in the protocol, 2 µL were used. This was deemed to result in too high activity, which could no longer be observed well enough in the data generated by the platereader, so the amount was adjusted .
Vesicles DLS-Measurements
Floor
15 mL of pET-Duet1 in WT was prepared for DLS-measurements following the purification of vesicles protocol.      The samples were induced at an OD of 0.47 and 0.49. The purification was performed 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours and 5 hours after induction. The overnight cultures of TolR-AU in KEIO and pET-Duet1 in KEIO were purified as well.     200 µL of all purified samples were analysed with the DLS. The remainder was stored in the -20 freezer for later TEM-analysis.
It turned out that pET-Duet1 in KEIO was inocculated instead of pET-Duet1 in WT.

Checking for collateral cleavage
Kasper
To assess the quality of Cas13a (Zhang lab; purified with a Hisselect gravity column and buffer exchange) a fluorescence assay was done with RNase Alert. Increase of fluorescence of a mix containing RNase Alert is idicative of RNase activity.
The following reaction buffer (10x RB) was prepared: 400 mM TRIS-HCl; 600 mM NaCl; 60 mM MgCl2; pH = 7.3. This buffer was used in sample preparation on a 96-wells plate. 10 samples were prepared as indicated in the table. NOTE: All values indicate volumes in µL. Cas13a denotes the protein mix purified with Hisselect and buffer exchange. This solution                  (~0.2 mg/mL) was left at 4 °C for a week. TcR denotes the target RNA, using RPA and in vitro transcription. This target is a part of the tetracyclin antibiotic resistance gene from pSB1T3. crRNA is the 1H crRNA from 06-09-2017 and 07-09-2017. NF H2O is nuclease-free water.

The mixes were left in the platereader for 3&nbs;hours, with measurements every 2 minutes and 1.5 minutes shaking.
The data was used as follows:
Blue line: Mean(A1,A2)-Mean(A9,A10)
Grey line: Mean(A3,A4)-Mean(A9,A10)
Orange line: Mean(A5,A6)-Mean(A9,A10)
Yellow line: Mean(A7,A8)-Mean(A9,A10)
These results indicate that for the reaction with 3.65 µL Cas13a, the fluorescence increases faster with TcR target than without TcR target. This can be interpreted as collateral cleavage activation.
LDH assay (dried samples)
Gabriella, Guillermo
An LDH assay was carried out with the dried samples of concentrations 0.5, 1 and 1.5 g/L of proteins B3 and A5 prepared on 07-09-2017.
NB: Instead of 1 µL of LDH-TDP solution, as stated in the protocol, 2 µL were used. This was deemed to result in too high activity, which could no longer be observed well enough in the data generated by the platereader, so the amount was adjusted.
Vesicles TEM
Floor
The stored samples of TolR-AU in WT and TolR-AU in KEIO 5&ndsp;hours after induction were prepared following the Preparing sample for TEM protocol and analysed with the TEM.      However, the samples contained a lot of noise, making analysis impossible.
This might be because 0.2 µm filter was not used.

Induction of protein expression
Jeroen
The OD600 of the starter culture was determined to be 1.1. Subsequently, 4.5 mL of the starter culture was inoculated in 2x1 L TB medium. Next, the cells were incubated at 37 °C, 180 rpm. After approximately six hours, the OD600s were around 0.56 and a cold-shock was applied. After the cold-shock, a 1 mL sample was taken from both cultures. The samples were stored at 4 °C. Afterwards, the cultures were induced with 1 mL 500 mM IPTG. The cultures were incubated overnight at 18 °C and 180 rpm.
Tuesday 12 September
SDS-PAGE
Jeroen
1 mL samples were taken from both overnight cultures. They were stored at 4 °C. The OD600 of the cultures was determined to be 1.80 and 1.72. They were centrifuged at 4 °C and 5200
x
g for 15 minutes. Then the supernatant was discarded and resuspended into 40 mL of 1xPBS. This was put into falcon tubes (50 mL) and centrifuged at 3220
x
g at 4 ° for 10 minutes. The supernatant was again discarded and pellets were stored at -80 °C.
An SDS-PAGE gel was run.
Lanes 1 and 6 contain a protein ladder; lanes 2 and 3 contain samples from culture one before and after induction; lanes 4 and 5 contain samples from culture two before and after induction. The conclusion is that there is no difference at the expected cas13a size between the samples taken before and after induction. However, one can see a slight difference at around 25 kDa. NOTE: Later sequencing results showed two mutations in our construct, resulting in a frameshift and an early stopcodon. The product would be around 25.8 kDa, which corresponds to this gel.
It was concluded that we should first repair the mutations in the construct before setting up cultures with it again.
Buffer preparation
Jeroen
An elution and storage buffer were prepared. Their composition can be found in the full Cas13a purification protocol. Additionally, a washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl; 25 mM imidazole; pH 8.0) was prepared.

Column elution
Kasper
NOTE: for the following steps, cell pellet from 16-08-2017 was used.
The pellet was thawed under running tap water until completely defrosted. Next, 40 mL 10 mM TRIS-HCl was added with 1 tablet protease inhibitor. This was frozen again at -80 °C. The proces of thawing and freezing was then repeated twice. Subsequently, the pellet was French pressed three times at 1 kbar. Then the pellet was centrifuged (16000 rpm for 45 minutes at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was collected and filtered with a 0.45 µm filter.
After Hisselect was cleaned three times in 10 mM TRIS-HCl, the supernatant was added and incubated for 30 minutes at 4 °C while rotating. This was then centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The Hisselect was transferred to a column and washed four times with the washing buffer. Next, the column was eluted five times with elution buffer. Fractions E2-E5 were dialysed in the storage buffer at 4 °C overnight.
Sample prep DNA isolation
Amária
With the overnight culture, a dilution range was prepared from -1 until and including -7, both in milk and in Mili-Q in a total volume of 4.5 mL. For -3, -5 and -7, each sample was divided into three different samples. 500 µL was prepared following the microwave method described in the DNA isolation protocol. 1 mL was prepared following the boiling method described in the DNA isolation protocol. Lastly, 1 mL was prepared with the Norgen Milk Bacterial DNA Isolation Kit following the protocol for Gram Positive bacteria. All samples were stored at -20 °C.
After the DNA isolation, all the dilutions (-1 uptill and including -7) were each plated out.
The overnight culture that was used didn't grow, so no results were obtained.

Buffer preparation and Hisselect column treatment
Kasper
The lysis buffer from 19-09-2017 was supplemented with lysozyme, benzonase and protease inhibitor tablets from Roche, as explained in the Cas13a purification protocol. Additionally, 1 L storage buffer was prepared. This buffer consists of 50 mM TRIS-HCl; 600 mM NaCl; 5% glycerol and 2 mM of DTT. The pH was adjusted to 7.5.
The pellet from 31-08-2017 was resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer. Next, the French press was rinced with lysine buffer (from 19-09-2017, without lysozyme, benzonase and protein inhibitor) at 1 kbar. The resuspended pellet was french pressed three times at 1 kbar. The resulting slution was centrifuged in the ultacentrifuge (16000 rpm, 45 minutes at 4 °C). Following this, the supernatant was filtered with a 0.45 µm filter. At the same time, 1 mL Hisselect resin (from Stan Brouns lab) was washed three times with the unsupplemented lysis buffer and spinned down for 1 minute at 13500 rpm.
NOTE: This should be done at around 2000 rcf.
The Hisselect was added to the filtered supernatant and was incubated for 30 minutes at 4 °C while rotating. The resulting solution was spinned down for 1 minute at 2000 rcf and the supernatant was topped off and stored at 4 °C.
Unsupplemented lysis buffer was added to the column until no air was left in the column. Then the filter was pressed down.
NOTE: All following steps are done at 4 °C.                          The loaded Hisselect is added to the column and washed five times with 2 mL unsupplemented lysis buffer. Next, the Hisselect is eluted five times with 300 µL elution buffer. This lead to fractions with the following Nanodrop values:

Checking Cas13a for collateral cleavage
Kasper
The new batch of Cas13a (purified 20-09-2017 and 21-09-2017) needed to be checked for collateral cleavage activity. The concentration of Cas13a in the aliquots was calculated to be 0.5 g/L÷146.47 g/mol = 3.4 µM. 50 nM Cas13a would be required for the assay, so 1.5 µL was needed. For the crRNA, ~20 nM was used. The sample preparation was again done in a 96-wells plate, according to the table below.
TcR denotes the target RNA, using RPA and in vitro transcription. This target is a part of the tetracyclin antibiotic resistance gene from pSB1T3. crRNA is the 1H crRNA from 06-09-2017 and 07-09-2017. NF H2O is nuclease-free water.

Testing other crRNA
Kasper
To test the other crRNAs (2, 3 and 4) a platereader experiment with RNase Alert was carried out. For this purpose, wells B1/B2, B3/B4 and B5/B6 were filled with 1 µL crRNA 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Additionally, 1 µL of target (TcR) was added. Furthermore, 1 µL Cas13a, 10 µL of 1250 nM RNase Alert and 10 µL of 1x Reaction buffer was added. A control was made containing everything except TcR and crRNA.
As can be derived from the figure, crRNA 3 was found to be the best one.
Making coacervates and Cas13a compatible
Kasper
To test the compatibility of coacervates (0.1 wt% polyU, 1 wt% spermine) with the reaction buffer, of Cas13a, referred to as 1xRb (40 mM Tris-HCl, 60 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 7.3), the following mixes were prepared in 50 µL.

Both were incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. Tube A did show coacervation, whereas B did not. This means that coacervates are compatible with 1xRb.
Given that coacervates can form in the reaction buffer of Cas13a, it was directly tested whether the coacervation method worked, by preparing two tubes of which only one with crRNA 1, and both containing 1xRb, Cas13a, target RNA, Murine RNase inhibitor, spermine and polyU.

*The stock concentration of Cas13a (~0.05 wt%) was measured using a Bradford assay, but no correction was made for impurity of the protein. Therefore the concentration is only a rough estimation.
Both tubes (C & D) were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C. Both showed coacervation and kept showing coacervation for over 5 hours. Taking into account that the lifetime of the active Cas13a is roughly 3 hours at 37 °C and given buffer conditions, this is an indication that Cas13a does not cleave the polyU in the coacervate reaction mixture.

Cas13a Start second plan: repairing mutations
Fiona
Since the first plan had failed and the primers for the second plan (repairing the mutations in plasmid 'J') had finally arrived, our plan B was started with PCR amplification of J with correcting primers. For this purpose, the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was followed with primers IG0069 and IG0070. A 7.7 kb product would be expected and was indeed obtained, as can be seen in the agarose gel picture below.
The PCR product from the reaction with DMSO was cleaned and concentrated , leading to a concentration of 271 ng/µL. The sample was split in two; one sample was phosphorylated. The other sample would be used as a negative control in the subsequent blunt-end ligation step. For the phosphorylation, the following sample was prepared:

The sample was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Then the T4 PNK was heat inactivated at 65 °C for 20 minutes. 1 µL of ligase was then added, after which the sample was left to incubate on the bench for two hours. The negative control (non-phosphorylated PCR fragment) was taken along for the ligation.
After the ligation, the sample was treated with DpnI and subsequently cleaned and concentrated. Heat-shock competent commercial BL21 cells were transformed with cleaned ligation mixture.

The samples containing the DNA were prepared following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. Next, the RNA was purified according to the RNA  isolation protocol. After purification of the RNA, the samples were prepared and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. We incubated the samples for 10 minutes at 70 °C and left them 5 minutes on ice. Next, 4 µL of all the samples was transferred to the slots. The gel can be seen in the following pictures.

Cas13a New ligation and transformation
Jasper
Due to a lack of colonies from the previous transformation, all the steps (starting from the phosphorylation) were repeated again. This time two variations of the phosphorylation were tried out: one with CutSmart buffer and one with PNK buffer. Furthermore, the samples were now cleaned and concentrated before the ligation as well. Nevertheless, these transformations did not results in colonies either. At this point, taking into account the time left for the project, it was decided to not focus on obtaining the full construct anymore. Instead, we focussed on obtaining basic parts, so other teams might use them successfully to create the composite part.
Sample prep Liquid culture
Amária
pSB1T3 in DH5-α was grown in 10 mL LB overnight according to the liquid (starter) culture (10 mL) protocol, in a 50 mL tube. The used antibiotics was tetracyclin and 0.5 mL of 20% glucose solution was added to get a 1% solution.

Sample prep RPA and in vitro transcription
Aafke and Amária
The samples containing the DNA were transcribed following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. Per sample, two different approaches were used: incubated 3 hours at 37 °C according to protocol and 1 hour at roomtemperature. Next, the RNA was purified according to the RNA  isolation protocol. After purification of the RNA, the samples were prepared and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. We incubated the samples for 10 minutes at 70 °C and left them 5 minutes on ice. Next, 4 µL of all the samples was transferred to the slots. The gel can be seen in the following picture.
The marker that we used is not suitable for the size of the RNA-fragments we were expecting.

Cas13a titration with coacervates
Kasper
To determine the upper limit up to which addition of Cas13a still leads to coacervation of polyU and spermine, six tubes were prepared of 50 µL, containing 0.1 wt% polyU and 1.0 wt% spermine in 1xRb and nuclease free water. All tubes were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C, and subsequently varying concentrations of Cas13a were added to to final concentrations of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0 nM. Coacervation was only observed if the Cas13a concentration was lower than 100 nM, and in presence of 10 nM Cas13a, only slightly higher turbidity was observed.
Sample prep Gel electrophoresis
Aafke and Amária
The samples were prepared again and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. This time the Low range ssRNA marker was used and all the samples were incubated for 10 minutes at 70 °C and for 5 minutes on ice. The gel can be seen in the following picture.
The marker seems very vague. We decided to try it again, but this time following the protocol described for the marker. We also prepared -3, -2 and -1 dilutions of the ladder to check if the marker was degraded or not.
The samples were prepared again and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. 2 µL of ladder was added to 38 µL of 2X RNA loading dye. Next the dilutions for the marker were prepared and all the samples (included the RNA-samples) were incubated for 5 minutes at 90 °C and for 2 minutes on ice. Next, 4 µL of all the samples was transferred to the slots. The gel can be seen in the following picture.
Based on this gel we can conclude that the ladder is not degraded. Also, this new protocol seems to work best.
Preparation of Starter Cultures for Protein Purification
Guillermo
Starter cultures of colonies B1, B3, B4, B5 and B6 (2x) were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 °C and 300 rpm for protein purification.
NB: B3 did not grow, so a new overnight culture was started the next day.
Wednesday 4 October
Making crRNA
Kasper
Three tubes of 1.5 mL were prepared with each containing 10 µL annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5; 50 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA), 5 µL IGOO57 and 5 µL IGOO58. The DNA was annealed by heating at 95 °C in the heatblock and slowly cooling down to room temperature.
Kasper
To check if the coacervate based detection method works if the Cas13a is activated before polyU and spermine are added, two solutions were prepared of 50 µL, containing 20 nM Cas13a, 0.3 ng/µL, 1xRb. To one of the tubes, also 0.3 ng/µL crRNA 1 was added. Both tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour to activate the Cas13a. Subsequently 0.1 wt% polyU was added, and both tubes were again left for 3 hours at 37 °C. Finally, 1.0 wt% spermine was added, and it was observed that both tubes showed coacervation. Possible explanations are that the Cas13a was not properly activated because either crRNA or TcR target RNA was degraded, that Cas13a is not able to collaterally cleave polyU or that the Cas13a concentration was too low to cleave all polyU within the 3 hours. Please note that 3 hours is also the time after which Cas13a loses its activity, as determined by fluorescence assays.
Sample prep Gel electrophoresis
Aafke and Amária
The samples were prepared again and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. 4 µL of all the samples and 10 µL of the marker were loaded on the gel. Also a positive control was loaded on the gel; the target used in the Cas13a assays. The gel can be seen in the following picture.
Protein Purification (Day 0)
Guillermo
New purifications were started by using the overnight cultures of colonies B1, B4, B5 and B6 from 03-10-2017 to induce one 1 L culture each according to the TDP purification protocol (Day 0) .
NB: B3 did not grow, so a new overnight culture was started.

The sample was left at 37 °C for three hours. Next, the mixture was incubated at the same temperature for another hour, after addition of 1 µL DNase I.
Following this, the reaction mixture was cleaned with the RNeasy MinElute Clean-up kit. A concentration of ~13 ng/µL was found using the Nanodrop, which is relatively low.
RNase A titration
Kasper & Jeroen
An RNase A titration was done to answer the question: what concentration of RNase A is capable of cleaving enough of the 0.1 wt% polyU within 15 minutes. Assuming that the collateral cleavage activity of active Cas13a is of the same order of magnitude as that of RNase A, this gives an estimate of what order of magnitude of Cas13a should be present. Seven mixes were prepared (final volume 50 µL) in nuclease free water, containing 1xRb, 0.1 wt% polyU, and varying concentrations of RNase A (10-1, 10-2, 10-3, 10-4, 10-5, 10-6, 0) wt%. All were incubated for exactly 15 minutes, after which spermine was added to a final concentration of 1.0 wt%. The solutions containing 10-1 to 10-5 wt% RNase A showed no coacervation upon addition of spermine, whereas the solutions containing 10-6 and 0 wt% RNase A did. This means that at least a concentration of 10-5 wt% of RNase A is necessary to cleave 0.1 wt% polyU in 15 minutes, so that it does not coacervate with spermine anymore. Cas13a is roughly 10x heavier as RNase A, so 10 times as many wt% of Cas13a is required to have similar molar concentration as RNase A. To reach that concentration, at least 10-4 Cas13a is at minimum required. With our 0.05 wt% stock, this means that in principle 0.1 µL of Cas13a is required per 50 µL reaction, but since our stock solution of Cas13a is not completely pure, we will use 1 µL per 50 µL reaction volume in the experiments that follow.
Sample prep RPA and in vitro transcription
Aafke and Amária
The samples containing the DNA of the -7, -8 and -9 dilutions (positioned on the left side of the second ladder) were transcribed following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. The samples were inducated at 22 °C for 3 hours. Next, the RNA was purified according to the RNA  isolation protocol. After purification of the RNA, the samples were prepared and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. 4 µL of all the samples and 10 µL of the marker were loaded on the gel. The results can be seen in the picture below.
You can see that the RPA-reaction worked at room temperature. The RNA polymerase on the other hand, does not work under these conditions.

Sample prep RNA concentration
Aafke and Amária
To check the quality of our target RNA, we gave the RNA transcribed on the -8 DNA to the Cas13a model, to perform a cleavage assay with. Cas13a showed no activity, which might be because only 1 µL of our target was added to the mixture.
PCRs for biobrick construction
Fiona
For the construction of the TDP/vesicle basic part biobricks, many PCR reactions were carried out. They were prepared according to the following scheme:
5 reactions (5 different parts to be constructed) at 8 different melting temperatures (gradient PCR) = 40 tubes. So 40 tubes are labelled. A mastermix without primer template is prepared, containing the following compounds:

The total volume of this mix (1827 µL) is divided over five new tubes (~348 µL per tube). To each of the five tubes, add: 20 µL forward primer; 20 µL reverse primer; 8 µL DNA template and 4 µL of Phusion HF polymerase.
NOTE: Keep the tubes on ice, especially after addition of the protein!
The following basic parts were PCRd with the indicated primers:

Testing other crRNA
Kasper
To test the other crRNAs (2, 3 and 4) a platereader experiment with RNase Alert was carried out. For this purpose, wells B1/B2, B3/B4 and B5/B6 were filled with 1 µL crRNA 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Additionally, 1 µL of target (TcR) was added. Furthermore, 1 µL Cas13a, 10 µL of 1250 nM RNase Alert and 10 µL of 1x Reaction buffer was added. A control was made containing everything except TcR and crRNA.
As can be derived from the figure, crRNA 3 was found to be the best one.

New PCR of backbone for biobrick construction
Fiona
There were no colonies from the transformation on 09-10-2017. However, there was no more backbone to do a restriction/ligation with. Therefore, the pSB1C3 backbone was PCR amplified. Thus, the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was carried out with primers IG0010 and IG0011. The PCR was carried out at eight different melting temperatures, ranging between 64 and 71 °C. An extension time of 2 minutes was used.

LDH assay and Cas13a drying assay
LDH assay (longterm Day 18, longterm2 Day 12)
Aafke, Guillermo
An LDH assay was carried out with the dried and liquid samples prepared on 09-10-2017. Additionally, the fourth iteration of the longterm and the third iteration of the longterm2 LDH assay was carried out with an L4, D4 and D sample of both TDPs (B1 and B5) at concentration 0.5 and 1 g/L prepared on 20-09-2017, as well as samples of B1 and B5 at concentration 0.1 g/L, LDH dried without TDPs and LDH freeze-dried prepared on 27-09-2017.
Cas13a drying assay
Gabriella, Isabell
A Cas13a TDP drying assay was executed with the TDP CAHS 94205 in a concentration of 1 g/L.
Several samples were prepared to be dried, as well as several to serve as a liquid control:

Restriction and ligation for biobrick construction
Fiona
The digestion assay protocol was followed to cut both the pSB1C3 backbone and the PCR products (07-10-2017) with EcoRI and PstI. Next, the sticky-end ligation protocol was followed to ligate the inserts in the new pSB1C3 backbone. The aim was to have a 1:3 ratio of vector:inserts initially. However, due to a limited quantity if available backbone, each ligation was carried out with 4 µL of backbone and 4 µL of insert The subsequent ligation mixes were transformed in electrocompetent Dh5α-cells according to the new heat-shock protocol.p>

Cas13a parts amplification for biobrick construction
Fiona
To amplify the Cas13a Part1+Part2 (which contains the cas13a gene with the biobrick prefix) with a suffix, the PCR (Phusion polymerase) protocol was carried out with primers IG0085 and IG0086. This was done at eight melting temperatures, between 60 and 68 °C. The extension time was 2 minutes. Additionally, the spacer sequence was amplified with a prefix and suffix following the same protocol. For this reaction, IG0023 and IG0087 were used. The same range of melting temperatures was tested. This PCR program was run with an extension time of 15 seconds. Finally, to amplify the whole construct (gene plus spacer sequence), the PCR protocol was carried out with primers IG0006 and IG0007, with temperatures ranging between 57 and 67 °C and an extension time of 150 seconds.
The PCR results are visible in the agarose gel pictures below. The first 8 samples are the gene, the second 8 samples are the spacer and the final 8 samples are the composite part.
Especially the PCR for the composite part has unspecific bands. Gel isolation and purification (Promega Wizard™ Kit) was thus performed. This only resulted in a concentration of 4 ng/µL. Another round of PCR to amplify this failed and it was decided to focus our efforts on the basic parts instead of the composite part.
Sample prep RPA and in vitro transcription and inocculation
RPA and in vitro transcription
Aafke and Amária
-8 DNA and pSB1T3 were transcribed following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. pSB1T3 was left overnight on the bench, instead of in the -20 freezer. Next, the RNA was purified according to the RNA  isolation protocol. After purification of the RNA, the samples were stored in the -20 freezer.
Isolates from mastitis infection
Aafke and Amária
From the veterinary institute in Lelystad we recieved isolates from a mastitis infection, which contain the BlaZ gene. In this way we can test our sample preparation and detection method on a more relevant sample. We inocculated 5 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth with the three isolates (S. aureus, CNS1 & CNS2).
Coacervation assay
Guillermo
TDPs were to e mixed with RNA in a mass ratio of 7 (TDP/RNA) with RNA 0.1 % and 19 % glycerol. 39 µL of each TDP were mixed with 9.5 µL glycerol (100 %), 1 µL of Ammonia Acetate (c = 1 M) and 0.5 µL Poly (U) (10 %). A series of controls were prepared without Poly (U) for each of the TDPs and checked. No coacervation could be observed in any of the samples.
The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 minutes and 10 minutes, but no coacervation was visible.

Restriction and ligation for biobrick construction
Fiona
The amplified parts were digested with PstI and EcoRI according to the digestion assay protocol. Next, the sticky-end ligation protocol was followed to ligate the inserts in the new pSB1C3 backbone. Two reactions were carried out simultaneously: one with a 1:1 ratio of vector:insert and one with the remaining backbone and an equal volume of insert. The subsequent ligation mixes were transformed in electrocompetent Dh5α-cells according to the new heat-shock protocol.

Both mixes were divided over 5 different tubes each, of 44 µL. To each of the 10 tubes, 1 µL of Cas13a (0.05 wt%, or 3.4 µM stock) was added. All tubes were left at 37 °C. At different timepoints, to one tube of the active and one of the inactive mix, spermine was added to a final concentration of 1.0 wt% was added and the tubes were checked for coacervation. The result:

Sample prep Gel electrophoresis and DNA isolation
DNA isolation isolates
Aafke and Amária
Three different methods were used to isolate the DNA from the isolates. 1 mL of all three isolates were prepared following the boiling method of the DNA isolation protocol. 3 mL of all three isolates were prepared following the Plasmid Isolation (Promega PureYield™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit) protocol. Another 1 mL of all three isolates was prepared with the Norgen Milk Bacterial DNA Isolation Kit following the protocol for Gram Positive bacteria. The two commercial DNA isolation kits were used as a control. The samples were stored in the -20 freezer.
RNA Gel electrophoresis
Aafke and Amária
The stored samples of pSB1T3 and -8 were loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. 4 µL of all the samples and 10 µL of the marker were used. The results can be seen in the picture below.
This time, the RPA and in vitro transcription on the -8 dilution DNA did not work.
Colony PCRs for biobrick construction
Fiona
The colony PCRs (GoTaq) protocol was followed on the colonies resulting from the Dh5α heat-shock transformations. 24 colonies were picked for each of the TDP proteins (2 CAHS, 2 SAHS) and the vesicle TorA-GFP construct. The primers, the melting temperatures and extensions times used for each part can be found in the table below.

Colony PCRs for biobrick construction
Fiona
The colonies were subjected to colony PCR (GoTaq) . For the gene, primers IG0085 and IG0086 were used. The PCR program had a melting temperature of 53 °C and an extension time of 2 minutes. The spacer biobrick PCRs used primers IG0087 and IG0023, a melting temperature of 52 °C and an extension time of 10 seconds.
PCR results are visible in the agarose gel picture below.
The top row of wells corresponds to colonies with the gene; the bottom row corresponds to colonies with the spacer. A lot of unspecific bands are visble (also due to the low annealing temperature). Nevertheless, colony 11 of the gene and colonies 1, 11 and 14 of the spacer were sent for sequencing (Macrogen) . The gene sample was sent with IG0005. The spacer samples were sent with IG0023.
Sequencing for biobrick construction

Because of the previous, inconclusive colony PCR, another colony PCR (GoTaq) was run on the gene. This time, primers IG0006 and IG0007 were used. PCR results are visible in the agarose gel picture below.
This time, the results were more specific. However, there were no bright bands at the right size. Nevertheless, colony 6 of the gene and colony 11 for the spacer were miniprepped and sent for sequencing (Macrogen) . For both samples primer IG0006 was used.
Repeat of spermine dependence at 0.1 wt% polyU
Kasper & Jeroen
A repeat of the spermine dependence assay from 03-Jul-2017 was done but now with three important changes:
The polyU concentration was adjusted to 0.1 wt%
It was done in the Cas13a reaction buffer (1xRb) instead of 20 mM HEPES.
It was done at 37 °C.
Seven mixtures of 300 µL were prepared, of which one (the blank) contained only 1xRb and the rest contained 0.1 wt% polyU, 1xRb, and varying amounts of spermine (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0) wt%. The mixtures were mixed by gentle pipetting and divided over three wells in a 96 well plate. The plate was insterted into the platereader and mixed for 1 minute. Subsequently, it was left to equilibriate temperature for 5 minutes, before the absorbance at 500 nm was measured.
Sample prep RPA and in vitro transcription
Aafke and Amária
The isolated DNA from the BlaZ isolates were amplified and transcribed following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. As a negative control we used both TS-broth and Mili-Q. The top of the blank was switched with the top of sample 3.1, contaiminating the blank. Next, the RNA was purified according to the RNA  isolation protocol. After purification of the RNA, the samples were prepared and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. 4 µL of all the samples and 10 µL of the marker were loaded on the gel. The results can be seen in the picture below. (1=S.aureus, 2=CNS1, 3=CNS2 and .1=boiling method, .2=miniprep, .3=norgen isolation kit)
As our blank was contaiminated, we cannot conclude anything from this gel.
Sequencing for biobrick construction
Fiona
The previous reads came back incomplete, which is why new samples where sent for sequencing (Macrogen) . For SAHS_33020, colony 6 was sent in. For CAHS_106094, colony 13 was sent in. Primer IG0006 was used in both cases. This time, the sequencing results came back positive and the TDPs were confirmed.

The overnight culture was analysed following the teardrop assay protocol. Again, the isolated DNA from the BlaZ isolates were amplified and transcribed following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. Besides that, also a dilution range of -3 until and including -8 was prepared in milk and the DNA was isolated following the boiling method of the DNA isolation protocol. The isolated DNA from the dilution range were amplified and transcribed following the RPA+in vitro transcription protocol. Next, the all the RNA samples were purified according to the RNA  isolation protocol. After purification of the RNA, the samples were prepared and loaded on the gel as described in the RNA electrophoresis protocol. 4 µL of all the samples and 10 µL of the marker were loaded on the gel. The results can be seen in the picture below. (1=S.aureus, 2=CNS1, 3=CNS2 and .1=boiling method, .2=miniprep, .3=norgen isolation kit. -3 to -8 indicating the different dilutions)
None of the dilutions shows a band.

Colony PCRs and sequencingfor biobrick construction
Fiona
Since the sequencing results came back negative, new colonies were PCRd (GoTaq) to find a positive clone. Primers IG0006 and IG0024 were used for the gene, with an melting temperature of 55 °C and an extension time of 2 minutes. For the spacer, primers IG0007 and IG0087 were used. This reaction was carried out with a TM of 53 °C and an extension time of 15 seconds.
PCR results are visible in the agarose gel pictures below. The first gel shows the colony PCR for the colonies with the gene; the second gel shows the colony PCR for the colonies with the spacer.
Per biobrick, five additional colonies were sent for sequencing (Macrogen) . For the gene, colonies 5, 10, 14, 15 and 18 were sent. For the spacer, colonies 5, 6, 14, 17 and D were sent. Primer IG0006 was used in all cases. The sequencing results for the spacer came back positive.
Sample prep RPA and in vitro transcription
Aafke and Amária
As none of the dilutions gave a band yesterday, but the undiluted samples did, we are trying it again today with a dilution of -1 and -2. The dilutions are prepared both in milk and in LB-medium. Besides that, we used as a negative control a sample containing the DH5-α with pSB1T3. The DNA was isolated following the boiling method of the DNA isolation protocol. the -7 droplet from the teardrop assay performed on the 19th of november had a countable amount, it had 6 colonies. This means that in our original overnight culture (from the 18th of November) 12x109 cells where present.
