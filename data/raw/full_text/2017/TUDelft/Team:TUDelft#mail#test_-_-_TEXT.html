iGEM Competition 2017
The international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is the largest worldwide synthetic biology competition for collegiate students. It aims to combine and create novel biological (genetic) parts, which can be incorporated in an organism, thereby equipping it with new functions.
Each year, multi-disciplinary teams from all over the world work for nine months to produce their own enhanced organism using synthetic biology. This year, our work will be presented to the scientific community at the Giant Jamboree in Boston in November 2017.
iGEM TUDelft
iGEM is a part of the large TU Delft Dream Team family. Dream Teams are teams that pursue their goals in many different categories of science. An example is the NUON solar team, which annually participates in a car race driven by solar energy. These projects are very progressive and are well known to people all over the world.

Previous successes
Previous teams have done amazing jobs. Let's follow this trend and get some gold medals in Boston. Read more about previous years TU Delft teams.

Antibiotic resistance detection by CASE13A
Farmers are facing the antibiotic resistant bacteria. Current scenarios make it increasingly challenging to treat cattle diseases. Antibiotics turn out to be ineffective as the antibiotics are not tested beforehand whether the antibiotics have any change to succeed. Instead, the farmer has to wait if the antibiotics will improve the health of their animals. Contemporary, the antibiotic resistant bacteria survive the antibiotic treatment while other healthy bacteria die, which make the antibiotic resistant “stronger” and more challenging to treat. This is why our iGEM team aims to avoid abundant use of ineffective antibiotics. Our goal is to make a home kit detection tool for farmers that is affordable, user-friendly and reliable in the detection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This way, our tool will be a big improvement on the current methods and farmers know in advance whether the antibiotics will have a chance to make their cattle healthy again.

Public outreach and Integrated Human practises
Considering environmental safety, sustainability, health, security, economic benefit, accountability, meaningfulness, public opinion, efficiency and beneficence, the iGEM team takes into account the perspectives of several stakeholders during the development process. By interviewing and collaborating with policy makers from RIVM, veterinarians, experts in medical centres and knowledge institutes, and farmers, the iGEM team aims to develop a value sensitive design (VSD) which is implementable in the niche market. This way, e fundamental research is translated into a product with a purpose.
Outreach
Besides the integrated human practises, the iGEM team Besides the integrated human practices, the iGEM team aims to show the general public the potential of synthetic biology. For this reason, you can find us on different events. Last month we were present at the Museumnacht in Leiden. Also, we presented our project at the Netherlands Technology Conference . Upcoming weeks, you can find us at International Festival of Technology and Bessensap.
If you know any interesting contacts for integrated human practices or have outreach, contact Kim Barentsen, our Manager Public Relations and Integrated Human Practices by sending us an email or calling us on our phone number.
