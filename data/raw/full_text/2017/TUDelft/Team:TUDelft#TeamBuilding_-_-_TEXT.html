During iGEM, our team became closer and closer. Besides working hard in the lab, on modeling and on the wiki, we also found some precious time for having fun as a team. On this page, you can find examples of some lovely memories.
Drinks
As a student team, taking time after office hours to enjoy a beer was essential!
Party
Now and then, we allowed ourselves to enjoy a good party, sometimes chique, sometimes just in our local bar
Dinner
Nice dinners also kept up the morale!
Outings
We also had fun taking time to explore new places!
Team Weekend
During our team weekend to Texel, we fished for Dutch shrimps and enjoyed some authentic Texel beer
Breda meeting
During our meeting in Breda, we played darts and sang karaoke
Sports
We even squeezed in the time to stay active!
Office
Luckily, it wasn't all hard work at the office - in between we were able to have a laugh as well
