            Especially in the animal sector, antibiotics are still overused. Bacteria that develop antibiotic resistance there, can spread via food or direct contact, posing a threat to human health. It is estimated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistant bacteria (<A href="#References">Oâ€™Neill, 2014).</A></P><CENTER><I>Schematic of the development of antibiotic resistance and how it can spread to humans</I></CENTER><P>The goal of our project is to develop a tool that will enable farmers to test on-site if a cow suffering from a bacterial infection is infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria. Based on the output, they can adapt their antibiotics usage, resulting in a more targeted treatment.</P><CENTER><I>Schematic of our project</I></CENTER><P>Our project consists of three parts: a recently characterized variant of the CRISPR/Cas system (Cas13a) for fast and accurate detection; tardigrade proteins that increase the shelf-life of our device; and the coacervation method for visible read-out. Moreover, we aim to use cells as mini-factories through the use of vesicles, truly transforming bacteria in genetically engineered machines.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Our project tackles one of the biggest challenges our society faces in the coming years - we offer a durable device that contributes to the reduction of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, our device is easily adaptable to detect any kind of DNA/RNA sequence, opening doors for the rapid diagnosis of many diseases.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIV id="references" class="section card"><DIV class="card-content"><SPAN class="card-title">References:</SPAN><OL><LI><A href="https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR%20Review%20Paper%20-%20Tackling%20a%20crisis%20for%20the%20health%20and%20wealth%20of%20nations_1.pdf">O'Neill J.
