A plot:
Insert here a comma separated value file with your data of the growing bacteria. The first collumn or row should contain the time and the other one the number of bacteria.
The calculation is done as follows. First it will check your input. After that it proceeds to an adjusted algorithm of the logit model designed by Kasper Spoelstra. This will do a coordinate transformation which will turn the data into a linear line. Linear regression is then very simple and reliable. This is done to get a good guess for the r. After that there will be 6 initial data possibilities chosen around the guess. All six will then be put into a least square optimization algorithm which looks for the best R squared. This uses a Gauss-Newton algorithm.
Even though we tries to get this as best initialized as possible, still we might be stuck at a local minimum. If the result is clearly off, or it fails otherwise, try to truncate the tail of your data points.
At the moment, the input boxes are optimized for Chrome users. If you are on another browser they might not be properly shown to you. The program itself however should work find. The input boxes will be improved after we implement the more optimized new website framework.
NB. If you want to insert a tab separated file, you should put the letter 't' in the input box for the value seperator.

I use a thousands seperator:
