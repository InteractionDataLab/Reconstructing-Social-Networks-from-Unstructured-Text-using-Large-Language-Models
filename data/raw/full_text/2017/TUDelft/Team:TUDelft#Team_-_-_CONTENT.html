Also, I have have been working on education for synbio engineers with the project “How can engineers include relevance and responsibility in their design”. To engage and educate the public regarding synthetic biology, the team was present during several Science and Technology events, and multiple articles have appeared in the media.

This comes down to reading and understanding papers and protocols, and translating them into experiments that we need to do for our project.</P><H4>Motivation to join iGEM:</H4><P>The main reason for me to join iGEM is that I knew it would be a unique way to fill in part of my curriculum by participating in this project. It is a great opportunity to work with a team towards the Boston Jamboree, and it is completely different from courses, committee work and individual research projects. I did not want to miss out on that experience! </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row card align-center" id="gaby-scroll"><DIV class="col s8"><H3>Gabriella Tany</H3><H4>Role:</H4><P>Secretary:</P><H4>Study:</H4><P><I>MSc Nanobiology</I></P><H4>Fun fact:</H4><P><I>Did you know that the first time Gaby decided to paint a painting, she spent 3 entire days on it? She was so preoccupied with it that she only stopped painting to sleep and eat. Even my friends were wondering what she was doing, since she would only reply to them late in the evening. That was 4 years ago, she hasn’t touched a paintbrush ever since. And oh, she loves hazelnut ice cream. 
    </I></P><H4>Role description:</H4><P>As secretary, I am like the mother of the group. My job is to make sure everyone is happy and has a full stomach. As you may know, moms are really versatile and that is also what I am in the group by helping out wherever I am necessary. Another responsibility of being a secretary is to keep everything well organized and handle all the incoming new emails and events. I try to make sure that the team will be kept up to date with all the deadlines and events.

This is what happens when you tell people: “Oh I like this thing, so if you don’t know what to give me for [insert random occasion], just buy that.” - and they never forget about it. Luckily, Isabell moved towns now, so she actually has the opportunity to drink all of it - she does like tea after all.

However, since this role is only work intensive during some parts of the projects, I have now morphed into a jack-of-all-trades helping with whatever needs help.
                        </P><H4>Motivation to join iGEM:</H4><P>The idea of starting a project from scratch and working on all the different components involved in research was what mainly motivated me to join iGEM. I also thought it was an exciting opportunity to really delve into a completely new topic for me - synthetic biology - and learn new techniques and skills.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row card align-center" id="jasper-scroll"><DIV class="col s8"><H3>Jasper Veerman</H3><H4>Role:</H4><P>Sponsor Manager</P><H4>Study:</H4><P><I>MSc Nanobiology</I></P><H4>Fun fact:</H4><P><I>Did you know that Jasper is growing his in-room garden (‘moestuintjes’) during the past months?

In order to conduct the science and public outreach for our dream application, we should engage in collaborations. I wish to convey our team’s enthusiasm in order to see if working together can be beneficial for both the above-mentioned parties and us!
                        </P><H4>Motivation to join iGEM:</H4><P>I find it highly rewarding to apply my knowledge. iGEM provides the opportunity to put my knowledge about synthetic biology into practise and contribute to solving global problems. Being able to do so in a team of ambitious students is a privilege. In addition to expanding my scientific toolbox, I believe it is also valuable to get insight into the organizational side of research, for example in designing the research, acquiring funding and conducting human outreach. Last, but certainly not least, I see iGEM as the perfect platform to show the potential of synthetic biology to the world. When I attend presentations or engage in discussions, I feel most inspired if the presenters get a sparkle in their eyes when they talk about the work they do. Personally, I feel that synthetic biology is a wonderful field, yet poorly understood by the general public. During (and after) iGEM, I aim to share my enthusiasm for synthetic biology and transfer this sparkle to as many people as possible.
