Also, I have have been working on education for synbio engineers with the project “How can engineers include relevance and responsibility in their design”. To engage and educate the public regarding synthetic biology, the team was present during several Science and Technology events, and multiple articles have appeared in the media. Helping team members to frame their scientific stories in a way everyone can understand, is one of my favourite activities.

However, synthetic biology cannot develop to its full potential without the integration of stakeholders- and societal values. My motivation is to flourish the iGEM project in a way that the project meets stakeholders- and societal values, and results in an applied synbio design with impact.

Nevertheless, besides all its useful aspects, the new experiences and working in a motivated group of students is just also a lot of fun!

Being able to do so in a team of ambitious students is a privilege. In addition to expanding my scientific toolbox, I believe it is also valuable to get insight into the organizational side of research, for example in designing the research, acquiring funding and conducting human outreach. Last, but certainly not least, I see iGEM as the perfect platform to show the potential of synthetic biology to the world. When I attend presentations or engage in discussions, I feel most inspired if the presenters get a sparkle in their eyes when they talk about the work they do. Personally, I feel that synthetic biology is a wonderful field, yet poorly understood by the general public. During (and after) iGEM, I aim to share my enthusiasm for synthetic biology and transfer this sparkle to as many people as possible.
