Only then would our project have the desired value to be able to contribute to the issue of antibiotic resistance. Developing a detection method in the lab is one challenge, but developing a detection method that could be used in the real world is another, more complex, challenge. The complexity of the challenge in the antibiotic field made it hard to find the niche in which we could apply and validate our detection method. By meeting with experts and stakeholders, we were able to shape our design to fit everyone's wishes as best possible, and make our design relevant and responsible. The timeline of our integrated human practices process is illustrated to give an impression on how our project evolved over time due to interviews with stakeholders, and those we collaborated with.</P><P>For example, we collaborated with farmer Paul Oosthoek and did experiments on his cow’s milk samples. Additionally, we performed experiments with the isolates gained from the experts Dik Mevius and Fimme van der Wal. Also, veterinarians gave us insights in their documents to gain more knowledge about the treatment procedures. Futhermore, multiple stakeholders participated in our project <I><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Engagement#videos" target="_blank">How can iGEM teams best include Relevance and Responsibility in their Design?</A></I></P><P>In the last section, we summarise the most crucial insights and how stakeholders interactions lead to impressive changes in our experiments and design.</P><H3>Project Timeline</H3><P>In this timeline, we take you on a journey through the evolution of our design.

To achieve high yields and profits, many farmers are now applying intensive farming methods which involves the misuse of antibiotic usage. Our first idea was to solve this problem by engineering a bacterium that can sense the pathogen and swim towards it. After arriving there, a neutralizing agent will either be released or produced and excreted on the spot. Antibiotic resistance shield The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistances. Although this problem has already been popping up in scientific and newspaper articles for over 30 years, its threat is one that can no longer be ignored. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that annually over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States are caused by antibiotic resistance. Moreover, it is approximated that by 2050, 10 million people will die annually due to antibiotic resistance.

Next, one team got to shortly explain their project as 'developer'. The other team was to ask questions as 'end-user' about how the use of the technology and its influence on their lives or work. After 15 minutes, the roles were reversed.

Nevertheless, we did not consider the application in fish farms as a feasible option anymore. So, we went back to brainstorming. Here, we thought about a new potential application: fighting (the formation of) biofilms, for example in industrial pipelines and on boat hulls. Additionally, we came up with ideas to remove biofilms from food and plants (Agrobacterium). Nevertheless, all these ideas either had a much easier and well-implemented chemical alternative or they were very questionable with regards to safety (i.e. containment of the genetically modified organism) and effectivity. Luckily, we ran into new possibilities!

Their paper indicated attomolar sensitivity in combination with rapid DNA or RNA detection, which would be perfect for detecting antibiotic resistance genes!

In order to improve on this method, we would require proteins from tardigrades (also known as water bears). Tardigrades can survive under very extreme conditions, such as outer space. Their robustness is (partly) derived from the so-called tardigrade proteins, that protect cell(-structures) and proteins from dehydration and preserve protein activity after drying and rehydration. The western blotting idea was discarded because of practical limitations. Nevertheless, we saw the tardigrade proteins as a perfect opportunity to combine an antibiotic resistance detection system with microfluidics on paper, for which the drying of proteins would be necessary!

Additionally, we wanted to do this in such a way that the final product would be cell-free. Inspiration for the solution came from other iGEM teams, who had previously tried to produce vesicles and transport green fluorescent protein in these vesicles. Vesiculation would indeed be a solution to our problem, so it was added as an integral part of our project.

However, we found out that we still had a broad range of stakeholders, leading to many values that had to be integrated. After this course, we really started steering our project towards a more relevant application. We decided that we needed to narrow our scope in order to integrate values into our design.

Coli, Salmonella, Streptococcus aureus and Staphylococcus agalactiae are the most common pathogens in livestock farming. Giving preventive antibiotics is not allowed anymore, the rules to prescribe antibiotics are quite strict in the Netherlands for the dairy sector. Every year the veterinarian composes a plan together with the farmer, for which antibiotics are allowed to use for which illnesses. When a farmer wants to deviate from this plan the veterinarian needs to have a written declaration. Every antibiotics used needs to be registered. A farmer can thus inject the antibiotics himself, the challenge is that while farmers are trying to reduce antibiotic usage, on the other hand, if they wait to long with treatment the illness could become worse, resulting in reduced animal health.
                                                            </P><P>We asked Gerbrich if there are possibilities to fight multi-resistant bacteria like the salmonella bacterium with antibiotics. She told us that there are still some antibiotics which are used only human. If the veterinarian decides it is necessary to use these, there can be an exception. It is however under strict supervision and noted down which veterinarian prescribes these antibiotics. If antibiotics can no longer be used because of stricter regulations, breeders should focus on health and robustness of the cow. Lower production of milk could also result in a healthier cow because the cow can put more energy in its own immune system. In order to bring the disease burden down, the environment and food for the cow should be adjusted accordingly. The stress on the animal should be minimized as stress has negative effects on the immune system of the cows. According to Gerbrich the solution to the antibiotic resistance problem is further reducing the use of antibiotics in all sectors of livestock farming. Besides this she thinks reducing the transport of animals can improve the situation as then the spreading of the resistant bacteria becomes less. When transport is necessary hygiene is of utter importance!

Sjouke believes that his chickens were infected via their food, which is derived from the Yucca plant.

In S. aureus, blaZ is relevant when looking into the β-lactamases. Other β-lactamases are not relevant enough. BlaZ produces small-spectrum penicillinases. This means that benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin antibiotics, common first and second choice antibiotics that are empirically used by the farmer to treat mastitis, can not be used is blaZ is detected. Rapid detection of this gene could prevent the misuse of penicillins by the farmer and gives reason to directly prescribe other treatments. From the policy perspective, the presence of blaZ has a lot of impact.

Paul stated that it would be better if the test really showed which specific antibiotic should be used for treatment, instead of knowing which antibiotics should NOT be used. We completely agree with this statement; finding out which antibiotic to use is more effective in helping to solve the worldwide antibiotic resistance problem. Another piece of feedback was to use larger test tubes for the detection. Currently, we use 1.5 mL eppendorfs in which the detection is done. Paul recommended to perform the detection in larger tubes to increase the visibility and to be more user-friendly.

Integrated Human Practices was extremely valuable in shaping our project. In response to dialogues with the public, risk assessors, and potential users, we changed our design from a GMO-based lab tool to a <I>safe</I> and <I>reliable</I> end product. Key points that we took from discussions with stakeholders were that the method needs to combine a <I>simplified sample preparation</I>, a <I>fast, easy readout</I> and the possibility for <I>on-site use</I>. We integrated all these in our project, by designing a cell-free method that can be stored for up to two weeks and produces a visible readout.
        </P><P>We started by finding a relevant case in which our device could make a contribution. Through a conversation with a veterinarian, we were advised to narrow our scope to mastitis, an udder infection affecting dairy cows.
        </P><BLOCKQUOTE>Every milk farmer faces mastitis, a challenging udder disease affecting dairy cows.<CITE>Bouwe Gall Frank (veterinarian)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This infection is not easy to get rid of; udders are exposed to the open environment, making the infection a common re-occurrence. All dairy farmers we spoke to in the Netherlands have had to deal with mastitis. Farmers want to have fast administration of antibiotics when treating this disease, as time is of the essence. Our tool makes sure that fast treatment of mastitis can be done in a responsible way, without misusing antibiotics, thereby helping to prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Looking to mastitis, we adapted our tool to detect relevant resistance genes in the common pathogen, Staphylococcus Aureus (SAU), causing this disease.
        </P><BLOCKQUOTE>It is relevant to be able to detect SAU pathogens. As there is a huge difference in sensitivity for antibiotics considering MRSA, it would be added value to have a conclusive result on the sensitivity.<CITE>Maaike van den Berg (veterinarian)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>
            After talking to experts with expertise in mastitis from the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research Center in Lelystad, we found that detecting the mecA and blaZ genes was the way to go.
        </P><BLOCKQUOTE>MecA can be used to detect resistance against all β-lactam antibiotics.<CITE>Fimme van der Wal (agricultural researcher)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>Detection of blaZ is a conclusive result to exclude commonly used penicillin treatment.<CITE>Dik Mevius (agricultural researcher)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For further information about these genes check out our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Applied_Design" target="_blank">applied design</A> and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Demonstrate" target="_blank">demonstrate page</A>.
        </P><P>After defining our end-users and detection goal, we looked at how we could make our device as user-friendly as possible. From the start of our project, we wanted to integrate the use of tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) which are able to maintain the functionality of other proteins upon desiccation. This fitted perfectly in our design with respect to our end-users, as our TDPs enable the transportation and storage of our detection tool at room temperature. Normally, protein function can be maintained when stored at -80 degrees celsius, something that is not always available at your local dairy farm! We also envisioned that this improved storage method will be advantageous for shipping our versatile RNA-detection tool for broader applications. For further information on our TDPs, check out our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Design#TDP" target="_blank">TDP design page</A>.
        </P><P>Adding to the storability, we realised that our tool needed to give a readout visible to the naked eye. At a farm, there are no fancy lasers or microscopes, so we had to get creative! We started by designing a microfluidics paper chip with GMOs with a kill switch to detect resistance genes, but gained crucial feedback on this.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Even <B>if</B> GMO kill switches were reliable, there is no public acceptance to use GMOs in the environment. <B>If</B> it will be accepted in the future, it will take years from now to legislate this principle. Innovation based on this gets stuck.<CITE>Cecile van der Vlugt (Risk Assessor GMO)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This led us to come up with a <B>new application: CINDY-Seq</B>. This method allows for a simple yes or no answer to the question: is the pathogen causing mastitis in my cow resistant to penicillins, or even all β-lactamases depending on the design of Cas13a, in a matter of hours, without the use of GMOs in the environment. For more information on how CINDY-Seq works, please visit our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Design#coacervation" target="_blank">coacervation design page</A>.</P><P>Now that we completed the design of our detection tool, we needed to look at how we could make the sample preparation as simple as possible for a farmer, as farmers like to do most things themselves.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>We try to do most things by ourselves to prevent high bills from the veterinarian.<CITE>Tjerkje Poppinga (dairy farmer)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the case of mastitis, the pathogen is present in the milk of the infected cow. By hitting the books and optimising existing protocols, we came up with an easy method to prepare a fresh milk sample for the detection tool. To know more about which methods we came up with, look at our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Design#sampleprep" target="_blank">sample prep design page</A> where we describe this extensively.</P><P>Finally, our integrated human practices strategy helped us to think a step further about our design, regarding, for example, the costs involved in our device and what it should actually look like; what kind of ‘kit’ will it be and what will it contain? We also looked at the feasibility of our device in the context of whether or not farmers would actually be allowed to <I>use</I> such a device and what needs to be done considering legislation to make this possible.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Only veterinarians can prescribe or change antibiotic treatments.<CITE>Engeline van Duijkeren (veterinarian)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Stakeholder interactions shaped our final design and made it feasible to transform our detection method into an application, resulting in a toolbox with which the farmers can perform the resistance test themselves on-site, instead of being dependent on slow lab processes. Simple, cheap and safe methods - for example the hand-powered centrifuge and boiling method during sample preparation, together with an optimized readout - make our device applicable for rapid frontline diagnostics. We developed our toolbox to detect the most relevant multiple antibiotic resistance genes, expanding the impact of our product to achieve better animal and human treatment strategies, see our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Applied_Design" target="_blank">applied design page</A> for more info!</P><FOOTER><H4 class="center">We thank our sponsors:</H4><DIV class="sponsors center"><DIV><A href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/">Faculty of Applied Sciences</A></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></BODY></HTML>
