TU Delft
TU Delft’s mission is to make a significant contribution towards a sustainable society for the twenty-first century by conducting groundbreaking scientific and technological research which is acknowledged as world-class, by training scientists and engineers with a genuine commitment to society and by helping to translate knowledge into technological innovations and activity with both economic and social value.
Department of Bionanoscience
The Department of Bionanoscience (BN) of the TU Delft provides our iGEM team with office- and laboratory space, supplies and an experienced supervisory team. The Department of Bionanoscience focuses on the fundamental understanding of biological processes, from the level of single molecules to the full complexity of living cells. This research provides fascinating insight in the molecular mechanisms that lead to cellular function, and eventually life itself. In addition, all faculty members guide several master and bachelor projects in their labs. Moreover, a large number of graduate students and postdocs receive their research training in the department.
Department of Biotechnology
The Department of Biotechnology engages in internationally-leading, groundbreaking research and education programmes in industrial and environmental biotechnology. The Department of Biotechnology covers the fields of biocatalysis, bioprocess engineering, cell systems engineering, environmental biotechnology, industrial microbiology, and biotechnology and society, combining fundamental research, engineering, and design. These fields are all directed towards biotechnological process innovations.
Department of Chemical Engineering
The Department of Chemical Engineering is one of the largest departments of TU Delft, involved in cutting edge research and responsible for several BSc and MSc programmes such as the MSc in Chemical Engineering. The Department of Chemical Engineering considers iGEM TU Delft a perfect opportunity to showcase the excellent quality and high standards of research executed by the TU Delft on an international level. This excellence is evident by the many good results and prizes previous iGEM TU Delft teams have acquired through the years!
Department of Science Education and Communication
The department of Science Education & Communication at the Delft University of Technology seeks to develop competencies and expertise by continuously linking theory and practice in both research and education. Both SEC’s master programs provide BSc and (double degree) MSc students with deep knowledge on how people learn, collaborate and communicate. Students apply this knowledge to real-world education and communication problems in the context of technological innovations. The department’s mission is to support and professionalize teachers, communication practitioners, engineers and scientists to get ready for 21st century technology development in which science, technology and society are more intertwined than ever before.
Faculty of Applied Sciences
The Faculty of Applied Sciences’ main ambition is to contribute to resolving the major social challenges of our time through its teaching and research. These challenges include a secure, safe, clean and efficient energy supply, health (e.g. effective medicines), security of food supply, green economy/bio-economy, safety and security (also in terms of information transfer) and innovation. The faculty aims to be among the best in the world in a number of research areas.
StuD Fund
The StuD Fund is a separate part of StuD. The aim of the StuD Fund is to facilitate innovative, entrepreneurial projects that will benefit the students of Delft University of Technology. Do you have an innovative, entrepreneurial and societally relevant idea? Then please visit the website and read more about aplying for financial support!
Medical Delta
Medical Delta is a network of life sciences, health and technology organisations. Based in the enterprising Rhine Delta region of the Netherlands, Medical Delta brings together a rich body of knowledge and experience, and act as a catalyst for health innovation and cooperation.

Hendrix Genetics is dedicated to generating solutions for the animal protein sector that meet the challenges of food production. Backed by a strong portfolio of leading brands, Hendrix Genetics provides expertise and resources to producers worldwide. With respect and care for people, animals and the environment, Hendrix Genetics is committed to delivering better breeding today, for a brighter life tomorrow.
Leiden Institute of Chemistry
Chemistry generates the basics ranging from our understanding of living organisms up to building factories producing sustainable energy such as hydrogen or biological alike insulin and fine chemicals. The Leiden Institute of Chemistry educates students, together with their sister institutes at the Delft University of Technology (DUT), in the joint-degree programs Life Science and Technology (LST) and Molecular Science and Technology (MST). The LIC’s LST and MST students will become the new generations of experts in the fields of process technology, modern biotechnology, chemical biology and last but not least sustainable energy. The LIC education programs enable a brighter future for everyone based on inspiring, safe and sustainable chemistry.
Pfizer
Pfizer endorses a four–part strategy to help address the issue of antimicrobial resistance: stewardship, surveillance, vaccination, and R&D incentives. Antimicrobial stewardship practices can help to reduce the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by applying greater oversight of antibiotic usage and more judicious prescribing practices.  Regional and global surveillance of antibiotic resistance patterns are an important tool to assess both the nature of the problem and the effectiveness of our efforts to combat them. Vaccines serve as a significant tool to prevent disease infection and decrease antibiotics use. We also focus on reversing the shrinking pipeline of new antibiotics and support the development of additional vaccines. Pfizer believes that a mix of economic incentives, coupled with regulatory reforms specifically focused on antibiotics and vaccines for drug resistant strains and emerging infectious diseases, can successfully incentivize new R&D.
Merck
Merck is a leading science and technology company in healthcare, life science and performance materials. Around 50,000 employees work to develop technologies that improve and enhance life—from biopharmaceutical therapies to treat cancer or multiple sclerosis, systems for scientific research and production, to liquid crystals for smartphones and LCD televisions. The life science business‘ purpose is to solve the toughest problems in the industry by collaborating with the global scientific community. With a broad portfolio of more than 300,000 products for protein research, cell biology and chemical-based and biopharmaceuticals, the business covers the bioprocessing value chain.
SnapGene
SnapGene is the first molecular biology software that is easier to use than pen and paper. Now every DNA construct made in our lab can be documented in a rich electronic format… and thanks to the free SnapGene Viewer, the files can be shared with our colleagues around the world.
TNO
TNO is proud to sponsor iGEM TU Delft this year, and wishes the iGEM 2017 team success in the fantastic CASE 13A project. The subject and approach perfectly matches with the mission from TNO: creating sustainable innovations by connecting knowledge and people. We think the multidisciplinary approach of the team and the focus on the application will give CASE 13A great advantage in the competition and future use of the diagnostic antibiotic resistance test. Good luck!
