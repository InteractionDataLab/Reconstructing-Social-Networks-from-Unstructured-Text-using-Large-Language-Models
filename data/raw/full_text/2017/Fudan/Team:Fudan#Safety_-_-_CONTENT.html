      All of the parts we used were reported before or in common use. We have also submitted a well-documented safety form including the source of the parts. We carried out the experiment in strict accordance with the standard protocols. All cell experiments were operated in the biosafety cabinet. The biohazard wastes were sterilized.</P><P>
      Meanwhile, we used the idea of stepping forward to execute experiments. It means that we always did preliminary experiments before next step. For example, we would first use EGFP rather than a real-world tumor antigen to establish the cell model; we wouldnâ€™t start stable infection until verified by transient transfection; we would first use different fluorescent proteins indicating our responses/outputs rather than cytokines.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Physical/Chemical safety</H><P>
      The lab is equipped with centrifuges, metal heaters and liquid nitrogen canisters and some toxic drugs are involved during the experiments. To ensure safety, each of us has passed rigorous lab safety training before stepping into the lab, which is demanded and confirmed by our school. Lab safety is always regarded as the first priority and regulations are strictly followed. Equipments and drug safety are checked weekly. Schools and colleges also conduct casual inspections on lab safety. During the whole process of the experiments, we insisted on wearing gloves, lab coats, and sometime masks. Safety goggles and other protective equipments were also used when needed.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">BL1 safety</H><P>
     Promoters, parts and transcriptional factors we used are strictly under control. These parts will not affect human at the species level. At the same time, <I>E.coli</I> used for building plasmids are strictly control inside the lab and sterilized after use. Our chemicals are apparently labeled and classified. In order to ensure the safety of the experiments and avoid pollution, we strictly implement the waste classification.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">BL2 safety</H><P>
      Our project involves a variety of mammal cell lines, including HeLa, HEK293T, HEK293FT and K562. In order to maximize lab safety and avoid contamination, we use a separate cell operating room to perform the operation on cells. Biosafety cabinets were used during experiments to ensure that cells are controlled inside the lab. The retrovirus vectors were modified so that it wouldn't replicate outside the lab. All experiments were performed strictly according to aseptic processes. We also have bio-clean air shower before entering the cell culture room and wear protective clothing and gloves during operation.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
