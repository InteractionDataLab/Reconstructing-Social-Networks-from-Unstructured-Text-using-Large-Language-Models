For this year’s iGEM competition, our team has chosen to submit three integrases CDS and their corresponding attB and attP sites. We have also submitted the attB and attP sites of phiC31 as improved parts. In our experiments, we tested all 5 integrases, phiBT1( BBa_K2460001 ), phiC31 and TG1( BBa_K2460007 ) from Steptomyces phage and Bxb1, phiRv1( BBa_K2460004 ) from Mycobacterium phage, for their effiency and orthogonality. Among these integrases, phiBT1 showed the best performance.
