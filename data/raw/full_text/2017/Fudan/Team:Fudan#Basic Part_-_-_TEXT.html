Basic Part – surEGFP
For this year’s iGEM competition, our favorite basic part is surEGFP (BBa_K2446051)
This part is a surface-expressed EGFP which can be used to create heterogeneous antigen density expressing cell model. Our team is very excited to be the first to bring the idea of antigen density heterogeneity to the iGEM competition, and propose a tri-response immunotherapy, SwordS .
How surEGFP works
Surface-expressed EGFP (surEGFP) is built by fusing CD8α signal peptid and EGFP to the transmembrane region of CD86 (NM_175862) from N terminal to C terminal.  CD8α peptide guides EGFP to be translocated via Sec61 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, while transmembrane region of CD86 embeds EGFP on the plasma membrane. Below, two confocal optical slices with 0.5 micron apart are shown, and the yellow arrowheads point to ER lumen/membrane with surEGFP. EGFP bleach really fast in the cell culture media and we could obtain a strong signal after surEGFP export out of the cell and expose to the external environment. We confirmed the cell surface exposed surEGFP by immunostaining with antibody against GFP, without permeabilizing the cells.
