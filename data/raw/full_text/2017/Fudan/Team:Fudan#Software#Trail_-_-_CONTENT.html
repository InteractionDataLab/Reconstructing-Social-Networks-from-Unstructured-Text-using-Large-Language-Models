Check out that slider over there!
                        Nεtro is born to help you design and explore your own gene transcription
                        network. Most importantly,
                        you will be able to manipulate the parameters in the model and get the response of the network
                        in real time.
                        Nεtro's running environment is browser, and that's basically all you need. Nεtro
                        is designed to be friendly to
                        all users, and no knowledge about programming is required. Just follow the instructions and have
                        fun.
                        As is discussed in our Modelling work, there are two potential models to analyze a
                        gene transcription network,
                        the Hill Equation Model, and the Probabilistic Model. The former one is easier and more
                        empirical, while the
                        later one is more fundamental and rigorous, able to achieve higher flexibility with the cost of
                        a little bit of simplicity.
                        In Nεtro, we choose the Hill Equation Model as our kernel since it has been familiar to
                        most people for a long time, and
                        thus might be easier to be understood.
                        A detailed documentation is included bellow for you get familiar with Nεtro.
                        Nεtro will be happy to play with you even if you haven't read the documentation, though. But we
                        still recommend going through the documentation
                        so that you will get a more comprehensive understanding of the principles of Nεtro and
                        thus become a better friend of it.
                        Remember to come back to the doc if you get a confusing 'WARNING' while playing. If you meet any
                        difficulty that is unexplained in the documentation,
                        please contact us via 15307130257@fudan.edu.cn.
                        Remember we have promised to demonstrate an interesting usage of our old friend,
                        matrix, previously in our Model? You will see the magic
                        in the 'Algorithm Uncovered' section at the end of this page.

                        several rules and error information that you might need to keep in mind.
                        With Nεtro, you will design your own network first, then you set the values or
                        ranges of some parameters. The network's property at steady state will be shown at last and ready to be manipulated in real
                        time. Among them, network design is the most important step of all. So let's start with how to create a proper network.
                        Rule One: don't feed too much!
                        The network should respond to a single signal, tTa
                        in our project for example. In Nεtro, the signal is simply referred to as 'Signal', and cannot be changed. All the
                        other parts of your network should be controlled by the concentration of Signal, either directly or
                        indirectly. To analyze a network influenced by more than one signal is beyond the ability of Nεtro
                        (It's just a kid!). A 'Network Incomplete' warning will pop out if something in your network is not in the
                        downstream of Signal.
                        All the other parts of the network is free for you to name. But we will suggest avoid
                        some special symbols like '&lt;', '&gt;', '$', etc. Simple notations like 'A1', 'LacI', or 'Nεtro_X' will be the best.
                        Rule Two: hit it where it hurts most!
                        You need to know what the network is
                        composed of. And the answer is transcription factors. Put the TFs at the center of your mind and the base of
                        your network. Make sure you give different TFs different names, even when they are on the same DNA. Take our
                        project as an example, factor X1, Y and reporter A are attached together, all promoted by tTa, the signal. Then you
                        should define 'Signal Promote X1', 'Signal Promote Y', 'Signal Promote A'. In this case, the concentrations of
                        all three substances at steady state will only differ in a multiplier (synthesis rate / decay rate). And since A will
                        have no effect on other things, you may choose not to define the last one.
                        *Rule Three (Crucial): what goes around doesn't come around, literally!This means
                        the network cannot be recurrent, or to put it another way, no TF can regulate itself, neither directly nor indirectly. A
                        recurrent network is very likely to form an unstable system.  Such system could explode, vibrate, or collapse into chaos. Others might own more than one
                        steady state (attractor) on the phase space.
                        These situations belong to the field of Dynamic System. Sounds dreadful? Nεtro agrees!
                        Anyway, you should avoid creating a
                        recurrent network. Otherwise, A 'Network Recurrent' warning will pop out.
                        *Rule Four (Crucial again): don't poke your nose into others' business!
                        This means the network must be orthogonal.
                        Each TF should have its own target(s) and not bother each other. This does not mean that one TF
                        can only have one target, because several targets can be put into the same DNA and different DNAs can have the same activator. Meanwhile,
                        a TF can either promote or repress, a target can either be promoted or be repressed. Otherwise, An 'Overloaded' warning will pop out.
                        Some subtle situations might arise here. For example, you have 'A Promote B', 'B
                        Promote C', and 'A promote C'.
                        It is recurrent? Nope. Is anything overloaded? Nope. Yet it is not allowed! Because both A and B
                        can promote C, they have to be the same TF according to
                        the orthogonal rule. So that 'A Promote B' is a self-regulating relation, and the 'Network
                        Recurrent' warning will pop out in such case.
                        The night is dark and full of terrors, fellows! Be aware!
                        Please note that we do not mean recurrent networks and nonorthogonal networks are not
                        good. They are widely used on the contrary, and may possess
                        fascinating properties. The problem here is that a recurrent or nonorthogonal Hamlet could mean
                        a thousand Hamlets, making it extremely hard to theorize
                        and generalize. A software capable of analyzing such networks is likely to be much more complex
                        than Nεtro, and is against our intention to provide a
                        easy-to-use tool.
                        Besides this documentation, you can also find a short tutorial in each section.
                        They will show you what you can do and what might cause errors.
                        You will definitely get familiar with Nεtro in less than a minute under their help.
                        After reading, you could fold them up by clicking the 'FOLD' button for a better view.
                        A software can never be perfect even after thousands of tests. We tried to protect
                        Nεtro from all kinds of errors and illegal operations, but bugs could appear where we have
                        never been searching before. We will appreciate any kind of feedback or even improvement from you.

                        The synthesis rate and decay rate of the transcription factors in your network is defined here.
                        The synthesis rate (Synrate) means the maximum rate of producing that protein. Please note that
                        its unit is set to be 'μM/min'.
                        The decay rate (Derate) is a factor with unit '/min', indicating the percentage of a protein
                        that dies in one minute.

                        Nεtro provides the powerful ability for you to manipulate the parameters and

                    Please note that these parameters are shown in natural logarithm. There are also default values for them,

                        Hope you have had good time with Nεtro.
                        Now, if you have read the documentation, or have got any warning yourself while designing the network,
                        you might wonder how does Nεtro detect those errors, like recurrence? In the video
                        below, we uncover the algorithm behind Nεtro. You will find that matrix plays a central rule in
                        the analysis of a network. Hope you find magic in the beauty of mathematics.
