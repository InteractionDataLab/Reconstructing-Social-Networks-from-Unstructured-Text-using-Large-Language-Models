     The relationship between Fudan_China and Fudan has always been intimate since the setting up, December 2016. All-round in-depth communication among teammates of two teams were frequent, and fully engaged to share resources and promote respective projects. Besides, Fudan_China lent enzymes to us and helped to develop our software. We shared our methods and equipments to them.

      We provided iGEMers of NYU-Shanghai with equipments and lab space to conduct Interlab study. Since we finished the Interlab work earlier, we shared our experience, so their work progressed smoothly and efficiently. Beside, we showed them around the laboratories of School of Life Sciences, Fudan University for further cooperation.

     In 2017 CCiC, Conference of China iGEMer Community, we had a meaningful and pleasant discussion with them about all the aspects of iGEM, like team building, brainstorming, human practice, inheritance and so on. After the conference, we exchanged souvenirs of university characteristic and maintain communication, hoping that our cooperation continues to the next session.

     In the collaboration with BIT, we focused on the topic about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several issues including the early diagnosis and treatment about HCC patients were discussed intensively. During the interaction, we absorbed interesting opinions about the disease, our idea also improved a lot thanks to BIT. In return, we shared the information with BIT about GPC3, emphasized the possibility and advantages of GPC3 as a biomarker for early stage HCC diagnosis.

      BUDS, a meeting for iGEMers in China to exchange experience, was hold in Nanjing University on May 19th. This year, the theme of the meeting was team building. Two former captains of Fudan shared their experience and opinions about team building. After that, each team introduced the process of formation, development and inheritance. Learning about the characteristics and experiences of iGEM project in each school, we perfect our team building. Judging from the present situation, these valuable experiences help to establish and maintain 2017 iGEM Fudan <B>a tight, efficient and sustainable team</B>.

      From July 30th to August 3rd, our team went to National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan to attend the Fifth iGEM Asia Pacific Conference. This was the largest meeting many of our teamers had ever participated. Of course we wouldn’t miss this good chance to rehearsal our presentation. During the conference, we gave a presentation to iGEMers from America, China, Japan and so on, collected their questions and tried to provide convincing answers. Frank exchanges lighted up the flame of thinking and promote the friendship between us.

    In August 19th, six iGEM teams in Shanghai gathered in the Fablab O Shanghai. Each team gave a speech about their projects and shared the latest progress, which was a good preparation for the final presentation. What’s more, we discussed that the close distance between us should facilitate a more convenient reciprocal collaboration in the future.

     From August 26th to August 28rd, Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was hold in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. During the conference, apart from the speech and poster presentation, we displayed our self-designed board game, Cell War. The novel and interesting game caught everyone’s attention. We played the game with the participants, introduced our project and collected suggestions. As a result, we not only got acquainted with many iGEMers, but also carried out improvements in our projects.
