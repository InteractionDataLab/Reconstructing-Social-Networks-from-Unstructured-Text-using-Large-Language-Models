Team Leader: Zijie Yang
Major: Clinical Medicine
‘Every team member of my team is greater than me.’
He’s always as humble as this ↑, while in our eyes…
Yijie Pan
Major: Biology
Yijie Pan, a boy of 20, Molecule Master of our team, loyal servant of all E.coli in our team, feeding them with plasmids all day and all night. He is looking forward to the day when SwordS-Yang takes his swords and defeats all the Cancer cells on the battlefield.
Yiming Cai
Major: Biology
His name is Yiming Cai, Cell Master of our team, considerate babysitter of all the cells in our team. He had to sacrifice his entire holiday taking care of these little creatures and finally got a taste of being a father ahead of time.
Ao Feng
Major: Clinical Medicine
An iGEM team member concerning Human Practice     and Interlab. A student in Shanghai Medical College of Fudan     University. A lover of cloud, whale, guitar and vehicle. Always be curious about the world. Awaiting to be your friend.
Xinxuan Xiong
Major: Electronic Engineering
Her English name is Merak. Merak is also the name of a star from the Big Dipper which is homophonic with her Chinese name. Merak is never tired of chirping enthusiasms and reading poems. As the only engineering student in iGEM Fudan, she really learns a LOT.
Tong Fu
Major: Clinical Medicine
Tong Fu, a typical medical student in Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University. Take part in Human Practice and do some wet lab whenever needed. iGEM makes her a busy bee rather than a salted fish lying on the bed after class. The excellent teammates make this competition enjoyable.
"Magic wand. Magic wand. Help up finish all the work in a day."
Yan Liu
Major: Biochemistry
Liu Yan is a postgraduate in Fudan University, majoring in biochemistry. She took part in the wet lab, both molecular cloning and cell experiments.
“Wish we can do it!”
Yiheng Wang
Major: What do U mean by 'Major'?
Interested in all areas of human knowledge, deeply intrigued by life science and especially neuroscience on top of all. He engages himself in learning various disciplines of science and technology, while also taking great interests in literature, music and arts. Being a mathematics lover, he constructed the Probabilistic Model for our project. As a programming lover, he developed our software, Netro. (And he drew the funny guys you see on this page.)
He is always asking...
Instructor: Jie Wang
Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
She is a doctoral student in Fudan University. She gave advice according to her knowledge and experience, and help the team solving many experimental problems.
Instructor: Yefan Hu
I was a member of Fudan iGEM team in 2015 and am current a research assistant in a cardiovascular development lab of Fudan. Though, my major is developmental biology, I know quite a few about mathematics and synthetic biology.
1st PI: Daru Lu
School of Life Sciences Fudan University
Professor Lu received his bachelor's degree in Bioengineering, and his doctorate degree in Genetics in 1996. Since then, he has been studying in the fields of medical molecular genetics and human genetics in the School of Life Sciences, Fudan University. In 2008, he was appointed as the Distinguished Professor and Vice Dean of the School. His recent research spans molecular cancer epidemiology, molecular genetics of diabetes mellitus, gene detection and manipulation technologies. He has been awarded Second Prize of the State Technological Innovation Award, and Second Prize of the State Natural Science Award.
2nd PI: Liang Cai
School of Life Sciences Fudan University
Professor Cai  came from Haining, a nice city located in the east part of China. He received his bachelor’s degree in 2003, and his PhD in Cell Biology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2008. In 2012, he started his own laboratory in Fudan. His researches focus on epithelial morphogenesis and actin dynamics. He is teaching 4 courses in Fudan: Introduction to Biology, Essential Cell Biology, Advanced Cell Biology, and Modern Microscopy in Cell Biology, using active learning and blended learning approaches.
2nd PI: Jing Fu
Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Institute
Dr. Fu focuses on molecular mechanisms of tumors, especially the cell signaling of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and translation medical research. She has done a lot of work on the signalling and function of oncoprotein Gankyrin, which is a new target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC. She published 20 papers on international journals including Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Autophagy, Cell Research, and JBC, etc. She have applied 8 innovation patents, and 4 of them have been authorized.
