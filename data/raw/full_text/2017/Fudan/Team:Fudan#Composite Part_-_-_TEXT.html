Composite part – SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;8*
For this year’s iGEM competition, our favorite composite part is SynPro(S)-43-8;8* (BBa_K2446028).
This part is a silencing-form synthetic promoter (SynPro(S)) which can be silenced by its corresponding silencing-form synthetic transcription factor SynTF(S)-43-8. This composite part has two congeners SynPro(S)-43-8;2* (BBa_K2446026) and SynPro(S)-43-8;4* (BBa_K2446027). They differ in the repeat of response elements on SynPro(S).
How SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;8*works
The SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;8* was designed in this way: it contains two core domains from 5’ to 3’ end: pSV40, ZF43-8 response elements (ZF43-8REs) in 8 repeats. While SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;2*/4* contains 2 or 4 repeats.
The advantages of pSV40-ZF43-8;8*
Without the existing of SynTF(S)-43-8, SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;8* can express constantly. While it would be silenced with the existing of SynTF(S)-43-8. The basic expression level in constant expression state is high. Meanwhile, it is almost completely silenced in silenced expression state.
The reduction fold of SynPro(S)-ZF43-8;N* is tunable by choosing different N* RE repeats.
