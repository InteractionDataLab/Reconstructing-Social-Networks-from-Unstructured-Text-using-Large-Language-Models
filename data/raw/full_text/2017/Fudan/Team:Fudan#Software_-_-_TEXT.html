To analyze your own gene transcription network in a convinent and elegant way.

To better understand our model, and make your own explorations.
BACKGROUND...
Gene Circuit is playing a more and more crucial role in the field of Synthetic Biology, and Gene Transcription Network is a central part of it. From doing calculations by hand to making simulations with computers, our tool to analyze biological systems has gained great advance during the last century. However, we find that many biologists, especially ‘future biologists’ are still struggling with a vast amount of scientific computation software. There were also much great software from previous iGEMers. But most of seem to require special knowledge about programming or other things that we might not be familiar with, thus making it pretty hard to get our hands dirty before it gets frustrating.
This situation inspires us to create simple tool that is capable of doing important works.  And thus Nεtro is born, to help you design and explore the property of your own gene transcription network. Most importantly, Nεtro enables you to manipulate the parameters in the model and get the response of the network in real time! Furthermore, Nεtro is web-based and a browser is basically all you need. It is designed to be friendly to all users, and no knowledge about programming is required. You will get your hands dirty in five minutes!
…Do simple things, but do it nicely…
In Netro, you can design and explore the property of your own gene transcription network. You will be able to manipulate the parameters in the model and see the network’s response in real time.
◆  Cannot wait to get my hands dirty!
In Netro_Fudan, you will be able to explore our model dynamically and make your own researches. This will help you get a better understanding of our model and get more insights into biochemical reactions in cell.
