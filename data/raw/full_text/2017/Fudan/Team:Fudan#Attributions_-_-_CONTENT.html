      Daru Lu and Liang Cai, helps us set up team.
      Liang Cai, Jing Fu, Daru Lu, Xiaoming Ding, Jiang Zhong, Ting Ni, Ruoyu Luo, Rongmei Zhang, Ziyan Yu, Yang Xie, Ziyue Wang and Yefan Hu gave us precious advices during the initial brainstorm.
      Zhiqiang Yan, Boxun Lu and Jinbiao Ma gave us a lot of suggestions for improvement and experimental supports.Guoping Zhao and Hongyang Wang gave advices to our project.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Lab and Technique Support</H><P>
      Liang Cai offered his lab space, helped with our funding and supported us along the way.
      Jing Fu (National Center for Liver Cancer, China) offered us hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.
      Zhen Xie (mentor of iGEM 2017 Tsinghua-A; Tsinghua National Lab for Information Science and Technology) generously shared some plasmids with us.
      Omri Amirav-Drory (Twist Bioscience), gave us some useful tips on experiment scheduling.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Funding</H><P>
    YunFeng Capital; The National Top Talent Undergraduate Training Grant; Fudan Discipline Development Funds.
    </P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Human Practices</H><P>
      FDU Bertalanffy Society supported us with information publish, renting of activity space.
      FDU Board Game Club helped us to improve Cell War.
      Haoqian Zhang (Bluepha) helped to promote our board game in Beijing
      School of Life Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University offered us opportunities to implement our HP.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Model</H><P>
      We sincerely thank Zhi-Fang Lin and Jin-Tao Gu for their warm instructions and assistance on the usage of software; Yue-Qing Hu, Yan Chen and Di Wu for their inspiring suggestions and useful discussions. We also want to thank our family, friends and lab fellows for help and support during the construction of the model.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Software</H><P>
      We give our deepest thanks to Tian Huang, the leader of another team from Fudan University, Fudan_China, for his tremendous help on programming.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Wiki</H><P>
      Jiawei Ruan, a member of Chenxi Studio of Fudan University, helped a lot with wiki editing.</P></DIV><H1 class="dash-title">Attribution</H1><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Project Design</H><P>
      Zijie Yang and Professor Cai contributed the initial idea of this project. All team members participated in the brainstorm and put forward creative ideas. The discussion with Ziyan Yu brought us fresh and excellent thoughts.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Experiment</H><P>
      Yijie Pan and Zijie Yang designed most of our genetic circuit. Yijie Pan, Zijie Yang and Tong Fu were responsible for most molecular cloning. Yijie Pan created the method to assemble multiple repeats of transcription factor (TF) response element (RE) based on 3A assembly. The assembly of DNA fragments with highly repetitive sequence is difficult even for companies. Thanks to his contribution, we can successfully build our Part collection.</P><P>
      Yiming Cai and Yan Liu were responsible for most cell culturing and flow cytometry experiments. Yiming Cai established stable cell lines for the experiments and did most of the transient transfection before cell sorting. Jie Wang and Yefan Hu gave massive help on confocal microscopy, offered direct hand-on help of the related figures of our project. Professor Cai and Jing Fu gave us a lot valuable suggestions and critical comments of the results.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Interlab</H><P>
      Ao Feng finish most of the Interlab. iGEM 2017 Fudan_China and iGEM 2017 NYU_Shanghai also contributed to our experiments.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Model &amp; Software</H><P>
      Yiheng Wang did all the outstanding works for these two parts.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Silver &amp; integrated HP</H><P>
      Ao Feng and Tong Fu were in charge of HP. All team members participated in HP activities. By the way, Ao Feng and Tong Fu were our contacts with the hospitals.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Education and Public Engagement</H><P>
      All team members, and Ruiling Zhong (current Chairman of FDU Board Game Club), participated in the design, test and improvement of Cell War. Ao Feng first brought the design into reality. Ao Feng and Ruiling Zhong designed most of the rules and cards (text part). Tong Fu and other team members helped to translate our Chinese version manual into English. <I>Blupha Inc.</I> helped us with public promotion in the field of education in Beijing.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Art Design</H><P>
      Xinxuan Xiong is responsible for most of art design, including HP-associated materials; the cover, cards, brochures, packages of Cell War; posters, wiki, team logo, suits and name cards.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Wiki</H><P>
      Jiawei Ruan, a member of Chenxi Studio of Fudan University, helped a lot with wiki editing. Yiheng Wang, Xinxuan Xiong and Tian Huang did a lot of coding. All team members contribute to the design and paperwork.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Team</H><P>
