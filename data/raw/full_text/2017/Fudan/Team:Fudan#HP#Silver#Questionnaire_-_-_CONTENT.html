Two sets of anonymous questionnaires, the expert version and the public version,were designed to collect data about knowledge level, attitude and attention of cancer immunotherapy. 
The expert version includes 16 questions, with questions 1-4 measuring basic knowledge level, 5-11 for attitude, and 12-13 for attention. For the sake of operation, printed questionnaires were made and distributed to doctors. Respondents were mainly from Shanghai's grade III hospital, including first-line medical workers in Zhongshan Hospital, Huashan Hospital and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Seventy-four questionnaires were collected.<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/a/ac/Questionnaire_for_Experts.pdf" class="notation silver-green">◆[Click to see the whole questionnaire]</A>
The public version includes 11 questions, with questions 1-3 for basic information, 4-6 for basic knowledge level, 7 and 8 for attitude, 9 and 10 for attention. Question 4 is a threshold, and those who have no idea about what immune therapy is will not reply the after questions. A large sample is of vital importance, so the public version was distributed online through SO JUMP and WeChat platform. Main respondents are undergraduates in Fudan University. One hundred and ninety-one questionnaires were filled and returned.<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/8/83/Questionnaire_for_Public.pdf" class="notation silver-green">◆[Click to see the whole questionnaire]</A></P></DIV><DIV class="block main-text"><P><H class="highlight-title silver-green">Result-Expert version</H>
The 74 respondents include 24 medical oncologists, 29 surgical oncologists, 13 Radiation therapists and 8 doctors from other departments.

At first, doctors in this survey have a modest self-assessment about their knowledge level on the topic. Questions 1-4 are about the concept, event and professional terms of immunotherapy. Only 19 of 74 chose “at one’s finger’s tip”, while 53 just chose “know well” about the concept of cancer immunotherapy. About Wei Zexi event, most doctors are in “at one’s finger’s tip” (30/74) and “know well” (38/74). However, questions about more detailed information have worse answers. About the question for inhibitor PD-1, more than aquarterchose “smatter”, “only hear of” or “blind”.
Doctors have more prudent attitude on immunotherapy. Questions 5-8 include possible advantages of this therapy and the hope of a nation-wide spread. Among all of 74 replies, only twelve of them agreed on “immunotherapy has strong specificity”, eight agreed on “immunotherapy has a slight side effect”, six agreed on “immunotherapy has a good effect”. By contrast, the majority hold a neutral or even negative opinion. Doctors have different opinions on whether to spread the treatment on a national level. Questions 9-11 are about the current obstacles and the argument that immunotherapy still needs more scientific breakthrough. There is currently no formal approved tumor immunotherapy drug in mainland China, 31 doctors answered correctly, and 30 chose “blind” honestly. As for the most obvious side effect of this therapy, the cytokine storm, more than a half of all the doctors expressed that they knew the severity of this problem. An overwhelming majority (60/74) believed that there were still multiple technical flaws about immunotherapy, so more research is needed. 
The frequency of first-line medical workers toknow about cancer immunotherapy is satisfactory. Over a third of all got in touch with related information last week, more than 70% keep in touch with the latest information within a month. The main information sources are journals (58/74) and conferences (49/74).

Among 191 valid questionnaires, 186 were from 18-27 year olds, mostly from undergraduates (165). 79 respondentsarefrommedicalprofessionals.</P></DIV><DIV class="block main-text"><P>
The self-assessment of basic knowledge about immunotherapy was not high. Questions 4-6 included concept, event and CAR-T, a specifictechnique of the immunotherapy. Question 4 was designed as a filter. Those who know nothing about this topic did not need to answer the following question. In this survey, the number was 65, so for the questions after 4, the respondents’ number was 126. There were 45 of them choosing “at one’s finger’s tip” or “know well” about immunotherapy. The situation was better when it came to the Wei Zexi event, while the understanding of CAR-T was the lowest, only 29 chose “at one’s finger’s tip” or “know well”.
Public has a rather positive attitude towards immunotherapy. Seventy four out of 126 stayed neutral, only 3 showed an obvious rejection, while 49 were for this new therapy. A situation was built when the doctor suggested this therapy but the patient knew little about it. In this condition, almost everyone (118/126) said he/she would follow the doctor’s advice, and search for more information at the same time, which is quite rational and smart.
The public sample has a rather low frequency about knowing the information about cancer immunotherapy. 44 out of 124 had learned related information in the last month, while 62 in the last half year. Mostly, they learned through journals (40/126), news report (33/126) and internet media (3/126).
