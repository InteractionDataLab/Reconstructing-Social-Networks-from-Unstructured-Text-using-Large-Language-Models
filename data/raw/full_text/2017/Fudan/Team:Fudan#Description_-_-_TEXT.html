Description
In this project, our team designs a gene circuit aiming to improve the diagnostic accuracy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
A previous study report a engineering synNotch fragment which can is designable to detect different extracellular membrane protein then to response a downstream signal. Based on their research, we design a new synNotch module which can be directly triggered by the contacting of GPC3 - a tumor associated antigen of HCC, and express a toxin to kill the tumor.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
