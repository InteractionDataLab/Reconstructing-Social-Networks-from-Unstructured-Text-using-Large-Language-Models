K2354010
Monobody was fused with gold binding protein and linked with 6×his tag. This fused protein can bind to the gold surface by the function of the gold-binding protein, and monobody can bind to ER-alpha/EDCs complex.
K2354011
ER-alpha was fused with ice nucleating protein. This fused protein can be anchored to the membrane of E. coli via the function of ice nucleating protein and ER-alpha can bind to EDCs for detection.
K2354012
Horseradish peroxidase is a kind of peroxidase which uses heme as it's cofactor, and it can degrade EDCs to less toxic compounds. Moreover, we linked fused protein with 6×his tag for purification.
