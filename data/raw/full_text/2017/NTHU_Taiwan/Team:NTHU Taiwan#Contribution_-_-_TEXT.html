Interlab measurement study
We have finished the interlab experiments and get lots of results in the page of interlab.
Contribution of new parts
We have contributed 12 new biobricks for iGEM part registry and submitted 9 parts to iGEM headquarter.(Table 1)

Validation of composite parts’ function
We constructed three composite parts and all of their function have been validated:
(1) Part:BBa_K2354010 :monobody-GBP HS
Monobody was fused with gold binding protein and linked with 6×his tag. This fused protein can bind to the gold surface by the function of the gold-binding protein, and it can thus capture our ER-alpha/EDCs complex.
(2) Part:BBa_K2354011 :INP-ER-alpha HS
ER-alpha was fused with ice nucleating protein. This fused protein can be anchored to the membrane of E. coli via the function of ice nucleating protein and can bind to EDCs for detection via  ER-alpha.
(3) Part:BBa_K2354012 :HRP-his tag
Horseradish peroxidase is a kind of peroxidase which uses heme as a cofactor, and it can degrade EDCs to the less toxic compounds. Moreover, we linked fused protein with 6×his tag for purification.
