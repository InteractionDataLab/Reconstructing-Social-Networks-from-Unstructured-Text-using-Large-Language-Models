Follow These Steps
If you have are planning to run this on a Ubuntu development computer,                 you must install additional packages in order to get the Pip package Pillow. To do this, enter into your terminal:
sudo apt-get install python-                dev
sudo apt-get install libtiff5-                dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6 dev python-tk
Next, you must have Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5 installed on your computer and accessible on the terminal as well as pip (may                 be already installed when you installed Python). This software comes default on Ubuntu and Mac, but on Windows you must get an installation from the Python website. Then, install Django 1.9 or 1.10, Pillow, djangorestframework, drfdocs, and bleach through the command on Linux:
sudo pip install django Pillow                 djangorestframework drfdocs bleach
Or on Windows:
pip install django Pillow d                 jangorestframework drfdocs bleach
Then, to install our software, if you have git installed on your computer, simply type
git clone                  https://github.com/MiBioSoft2017/ProtoCat4.git
Otherwise, you can go to the Github page and click download there.
Now, open up a terminal/command prompt and go into the newly downloaded folder (default name Michigan16) and type in                 the follow:
cd mibiosoft
python manage.py                  makemigrations
python manage.py                   migrate
python manage.py runserver                  0.0.0.0:8000
