Rice University iGEM Team
This year, we collaborated with Rice University's iGEM team on an app that would                   display information such as structure and function of a molecule once the user                   'imaged' a moving crystal. The purpose of this project was to make a way for people                   to get a better understanding about molecules such as hemoglobin, as well as provide                   insight as to how the structures are determined.
