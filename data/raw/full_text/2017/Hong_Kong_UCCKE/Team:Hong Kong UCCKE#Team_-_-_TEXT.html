About our team
We are a group of secondary students from United Christian College (Kowloon East) in Hong Kong. Being a relatively new school in the city, UCCKE supports innovative ideas and attempts to try new things. This is our second time joining iGEM.
Our team is formed as an extracurricular activity group, being called the Biology Research Team. Albeit the limited resources we own and the lack of experience, we aim to study Synthetic Biology through experiments and researches. From the days onwards, We look for more opportunities to interchange knowledge and gain experiences.
