The Cure for GOUT
About Our Project
A Meter and Medication of Gout:
Uric Acid Detector, Disintegration and Deployment
Knowing that about 1% of the world's population is suffering from gout, which is formed due to the crystallisation thus accumulation of uric acid in synovial fluid, thereby bring about extreme pain to the patients every day, we would like to use genetic engineering techniques to help them by developing a rapid detection method potential gout patients simply by measuring the concentration of uric acid in their blood. It is hoped by preventing the increase of uric acid concentration to a certain threshold, a cure for gout can thus be invented. However, our investigation towards this application is still in progress. Notwithstanding, several parts have already been designed to achieve the above goals along with assays designed to test and demonstrate the sensibility and curability of our parts.
