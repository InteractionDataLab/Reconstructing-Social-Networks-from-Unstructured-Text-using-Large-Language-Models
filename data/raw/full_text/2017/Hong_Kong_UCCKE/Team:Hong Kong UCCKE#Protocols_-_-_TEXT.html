Gel Electrophoresis
Materials needed
Agarose powder
TAE Buffer
Hot plate and Water Bath
SYBR Green dye
Gel Tank
DNA Samples
Loading Dye
1KB ladder marker
Power supply
Prepare Agarose Gel
Gel solution (1%)
Measure 0.6 g Agarose powder and add it to a 200 ml conical flask
Add 60 ml TAE Buffer to the flask
Cover the opening with aluminium foil
Melt the agarose using the hot plate until the solution becomes clear
Let the solution cool to about 50-55°C using water bath, swirl the flask occasionally to cool evenly.
Add 6μl of SYBR Green dye into the solution.
*SYBR Green is light-sensitive, keep it dark*
Seal the ends of the casting tray with two layers of tap
Place the combs in the gel casting tray
Pour the melted agarose solution into the casting tray and let cool until it is solid, it should appear milky white
Carefully pull out the combs and remove the tape
Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber
Add enough TAE Buffer (About 120 ml) so that there is about 2-3 mm of buffer over the Gel
Loading The Gel
Record the order each sample will be loaded on the gel, including who prepared the sample, the DNA template -
from what organism did the DNA came from, controls and ladder.
Add 2μl loading buffer on parafilm. (Same number as sample)
Carefully pipette 10μl of each sample and mix with loading buffer.
Load the mixed sample to the corresponding well.
Pipette 10μl of the DNA ladder marker into at least one well of each row on the gel.
Running The Gel
Place the lid on the gel box, connecting the electrodes.
Connect the electrode wires to the power supply, making sure the positive (red) and negative (black) are correctly connected.
Turn on the power supply to about 120 volts, current:300
Check to make sure the current is running through the buffer by looking for bubbles forming on each electrode.
Check to make sure that the current is running in the correct direction by observing the movement of the blue loading dye – this will take a couple of minutes (it will run in the same direction as the DNA).
Let the power run until the blue dye approaches the end of the gel.
Turn off the power.
Disconnect the wires from the power supply.
Remove the lid of the electrophoresis chamber.
Using gloves, carefully remove the tray and gel.
Gel purification
Materials
We are using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit for Gel purification
Protocols
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg gel - 100 pl). The maximum amount of gel per spin column is 400 mg. For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG.
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2-3 min to help dissolve gel. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 pl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The mixture turns yellow.
Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube or into a vacuum manifold. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min or apply vacuum to the manifold until all the samples have passed through the column. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes of >800 μl, load and spin/apply vacuum again.
If DNA will subsequently be used for sequencing, in vitro transcription, or microinjection, add 500 μl Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min or apply vacuum. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 750 μl Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min or apply vacuum. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
Note: If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (e.g., sequencing, bluntended ligation), let the column stand 2–5 min after addition of Buffer PE.
Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 μl Buffer EB to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min. After the addition of Buffer EB to the QIAquick membrane, increasing the incubation time to up to 4 min can increase the yield of purified DNA.
If purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
Ligation
Materials needed
T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer
T4 DNA Ligase
Microcentrifuge
Thermocycler, or waterbath and thermometer
Restriction Digest: pSB1C3 linearized plasmid backbone

Protocol
Add 2ul from the pSB1C3 linearized plasmid backbone digest.

Add 1μl of T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer.
Add 0.5μl of T4 DNA Ligase (keep this at -20°C until use!).
Mix by gently pipetting up and down 3x. Do not vortex; this inactivates the enzymes. Place tube in microcentrifuge for a quick 5 second spin or flick the tube to collect the mixture at the bottom.
Incubate at 16°C for 30 minutes, then at 80°C for 20 minutes using a thermocycler.
