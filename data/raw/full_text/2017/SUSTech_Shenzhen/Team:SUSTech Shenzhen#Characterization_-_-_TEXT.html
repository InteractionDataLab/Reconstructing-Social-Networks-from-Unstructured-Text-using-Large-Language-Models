Parts Characterization
We successfully improve characterization of parts BBa_K309016 —GFP with introns used in C.elegans. What’s more, we optimize the sequence to make the coding sequence stats with “ATG”. The optimized GFP is submitted.
We construct a str-1::Chrimson::GEMgeco::GFP fusion gene and inject it into C.elegans. The function of GFP is to localize the neuron AWB with the help of promoter str-1.
We capture the image of GFP specifically expressed in AWB with confocal microscope and clearly observe AWB even its dendrite.
Head of C.elegans, the arrow point to neuron AWB.
