Light Induced Learning System in C. elegans
GLANCE
EXPLORE
In a Glance
Learning is the act of acquiring new or modifying and reinforcing existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences which may lead to a potential change in synthesizing information, depth of the knowledge, attitude or behavior relative to the type and range of experience.
The learning behavior of C. elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) has been studied for a long time. Worms are demonstrated to possess both non-associative and associative learnings induced by intermittent stimulation of chemicals or heavy metals.
However, the main drawback of these studies is chemical stimuli cannot be withdrew cleanly. The the residual chemicals will make it impossible to avoid the stimuli cross-contamination. They will make the results difficult to interpret.
In our project, we design novel synthetic biology methods to overcome this obstacle.
One Target
to study learning behavior in C. elegans
Two Approaches
to provide accurate insight into the worm's neural system
Three Systems
to enable observations at both the neuron level and the behavior level
