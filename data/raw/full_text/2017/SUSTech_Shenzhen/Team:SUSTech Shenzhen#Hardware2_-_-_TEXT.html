2. Design for Light in spatio-temporal
2.1 Device One: Arduino modulate Mercury lamp
A simple and effective device to output pulse of certain wavelength of light. On time and off time of pulse is custom by Arduio. Wavelength of light is modified by replacing filter before beam expander.

2.2 Device Two: Projector Tracker
2.1 Basic mechanical and optics
We need 395nm light to activate Calcium indicator protein GEM-GECO by Lumencor LED Illuminator. Then both red light and blue light activate CoChR or Chrimson by LCD projector. LCD projector and LED Illuminator are merged by a double LH Adapter contained a semi-transparent mirror. Double LH Adapter connect to entrance of light in microscope. So we can use these two light source together.
Fig. 2 Light Pathway of projector and microscope
We choose projector as red and blue light source, because we can activate single cell or //C. elegans// with adjustable color and intensity. Because the focus distance of origin lens in projector too short for our microscopy(Nikon Ti-E), a longer focus distance lens is replaced. We install a new lens in projector. To purify light of the projector, origin blue channel filter is replaced in Chroma ET480/20X and red channel filter is replaced in Chroma ET630/20X .  Dimirror is 89402bs , and emssion filter is 89402m .
