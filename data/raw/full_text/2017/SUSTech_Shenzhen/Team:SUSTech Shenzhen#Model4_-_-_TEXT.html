1 Downstream promoter selection
1.1 Method
Downstream promoter selection
Since we constructed first two plasmids contain selected promoters for AWA and AWB, downstream neurons also need promoters to express indicator to discover the neuron circuit being built, which means the new circuit is built for the new behaviour of C.eegans. The purpose of this model is to select promoters used in downstream neurons which have greatest possibility to be lighted on when AWA and AWB are actived.
Firstly, we assume that the strength of a connection is positively correlated with the number of synapses, including synaptic outputs from any group of presynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the total synaptic outputs of the presynaptic neurons and synaptic inputs to any group of postsynaptic neurons in the network should represent more than 10% of the synaptic inputs of the postsynaptic neurons.
Depend on this assumption, we need to find downstream promoters which can lead to expressing of indicator in several neurons. Meanwhile, there should have some distance between these neurons for us to distinguish each of them under microscope. What’s more, it is better that these neurons may have some relationship in our pathway according to papers.
Method
1. Make a table which record the promoter expression location. Data source:
2. Make a table recording the neurons that cannot use same promoter for they are close to each other. Data source:
