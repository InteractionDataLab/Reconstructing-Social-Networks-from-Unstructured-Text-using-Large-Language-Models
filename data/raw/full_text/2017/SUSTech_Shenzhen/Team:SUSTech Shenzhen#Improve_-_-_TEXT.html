Part:BBa_K2492002
We tried to utilize mCherry from biobricks distribution to genetically label neuron AWA in C. elegans’ (Caenorhabditis elegans) head. We found a mCherry part C. elegans, BBa_K2005050 submitted by iGEM16_Vanderbilt. However, their mCherry was not designed for C. elegans. Lacking of any intron in a gene will diminish its expression in C elegans In addition, the codon is not optimized for C elegans. We obtained its sequence, and improved the codon with C.elegans codon adaptor [1] , and insert three introns based the previous reserch [2] （fig1）.
Figure 1:Alignment between BBa_K2005050 and BBa_K2492002(optimized mCherry) .
The mCherry part we use is optimized for C.elegans. We added the characterization onto the part page since the original part has no visual characterization neither on part page nor on their wiki. However, our mCherry is expressed in C.elegans，so plate reader and flow cytometer are not available for fluorescence measurement.  To locate the position of neuron AWA in C.elegans head. We observe C.elegans with a confocal microscope(Figure 2). The entire neuron with dendrite can be observed distinctly. The branch of dendrite near the mouse can be observed as described in wormatlas .
