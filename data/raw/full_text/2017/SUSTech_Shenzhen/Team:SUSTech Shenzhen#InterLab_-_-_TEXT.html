Interlab Study
Description
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to all engineering disciplines including synthetic biology. However, repeatable measurements are difficult to achieve in different laboratories. This year the aim of interlab study is to make the measurement tools more available since the fluorescence data usually cannot be compared due to the reason that they are reported in different units and different scientists process data in different ways. The InterLab protocol aims to address these issues by providing researchers with a detailed protocol and data analysis form, which yields absolute units to measure GFP in a plate reader.

Results
Fig.1-1 Fluorescein Standard Curve
Fig.1-2 Fluorescein Standard Curve (log scale)
Fig.2-1 The ratio of uM Fluorescein/OD600, which convert the Fluorescence intensity of each test device or control group(Colony 1) to the number of Fluorescein.
Fig.2-2 The ratio of uM Fluorescein/OD600, which convert the Fluorescence intensity of each test device or control group(Colony 2) to the number of Fluorescein.
Conclusion
It can be seen that for some devices have obvious errors which indicating a lot of variation in the results. In general, the ratio decreased over time for all samples.
During the experiment ,the result is better when culture the cell in  amber falcon tube than that in the normal tube covered with foil.
The standard curve is not very linear, some data made the curve a little crooked.
The plasmid test device 1 had the problem to transformation and is difficult to culture the E.coli contained it. We have sequenced all the plasmids and compared with the map on the item official web site , then we found out that the sequence of the bacteria are not all correct. So we do a series selection to picked the right one out. However, the colony device 1 with correct sequence may have much more expression the result is not very idea, as well.
