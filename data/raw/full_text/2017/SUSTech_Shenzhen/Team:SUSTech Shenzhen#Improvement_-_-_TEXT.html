Since we need to express proteins in C. elegans, introns should be added to achieve a good expression level of proteins. The part … is reporter mcherry (a kind of red fluorescence protein), we get the sequences of mcherry and add introns.
The mcherry part we use is optimized for C. elegans and performs excellently under confocal microscope. The whole neuron with dendrites can be observed distinctly. We can even observe the branch of dendrites near the arrow.
Figure: The head of C. elegans, arrows point to AWA stoma and one of the branches
