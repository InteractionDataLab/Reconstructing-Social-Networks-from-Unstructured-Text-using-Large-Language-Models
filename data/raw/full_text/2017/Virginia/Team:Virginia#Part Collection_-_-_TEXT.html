Part Collection
This part collection includes reporter circuits of newly introduced promoters, functional nitrification pathway enzymes coding sequence, and the final combination of promoters and protein coding sequence. Future team can build more complex nitrification circuits with additional desired functions based on our part collection. This collection should serve as a base for further research related to nitrification and denitrification pathways, as well as be considered as a significant step taken towards an ideally constructed circuit.
Basic Parts
BBa_K2272000 - a promoter that is maximally induced under microaerobic condition and regulates the expression of VHb, a bacterial hemoglobin that acts as a terminal oxidase.
BBa_K2272001 - a promoter that regulates the production of MnSOD (mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase), which detoxify radical oxygen produced by mitochondrial respiration.
BBa_K2272002 - this part encodes Hydroxylamine Oxidoreductase (HAO), which catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite
BBa_K2272003 - this part encodes two cytochromes that facilitate electron transport during the nitrification process
BBa_K2272004 - this sequence from Paracoccus denitrificans codes for a signal peptide that will export the tagged protein to the periplasm of the cell
BBa_K2272005 - this sequence from Nitrosomonas europaea codes for a signal peptide that exports the tagged protein to the periplasm of the cell
