Ammonia Oxidation Kinetics
AMO is ammonia monooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ammonia \(\ce{NH_3} \) into hydroxylamine \(\ce{NH_2OH}\). The rate of production \( R \) of the hydroxylamine is given by  \[     R = \frac{d[\ce{NH_2OH}]}{dt} = v[\text{AMO-NH}_3] = \frac{v[\text{AMO}]_T[\ce{NH_3}]}{[\ce{NH_3}] + K_M}     \]  The Michaelis constant is \( K_M = 1.34\pm0.22~\text{mM} \) (ref:Keener), the substrate concentration \( [\ce{NH_3}] \) will be measured experimentally or deliberately chosen, and the total protein concentration \( [\text{AMO}]_T \) is to be estimated.
