✓ Meet All Competition Deliverables: Wiki, Project Attribution, Poster, Presentation, Safety Form , Judging Form , Judging Forms & Sample Submissions
✓ Attribution Page created.
✓ Submitted Interlab Measurement Study Results .
✓ Documented Biobrick Contributions
Silver
✓ Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part of your own design that is central to your project works as expected. Document the experimental characterization of this part on the Main Page of that Part’s Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (following Registry submission guidelines).
✓ Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities. Collaborations with the University of Delaware and Manchester University
✓ Consulted Experts about the safety and implementation of our device.
Gold
✓ Expand on the silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
✓ Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other. Specifically, we improved the functions of DTU Denmark 2013 Bricks
✓ Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling . Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
