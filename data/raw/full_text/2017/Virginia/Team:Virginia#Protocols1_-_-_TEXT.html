Chemical Transformation
Methods:
Thaw 50µL competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes
Add:
5-10 µl DNA from a ligation reaction mix or
10-100ng DNA of a known plasmid
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 950 µl of room temperature SOC or LB media into the mixture.
Incubate at 37°C and 200-250 rpm for 60 minutes.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Spread:
For ligation reaction DNA: 100µl of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate. For the rest of 900 µL:
Pellet cells at 8000rpm for 3 minutes
Remove and dispense 600 µL of supernatant
Re-suspend cells by light vortexing
Plate resuspended cells as above
For known plasmid: 10 & 100 µL of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate. For the rest of 890 µL:
Pellet cells at 8000rpm for 3 minutes
Remove and dispense 600 µL of supernatant
Re-suspend cells by light vortexing
Plate resuspended cells as above
Incubate overnight at 37°C with plates upside down.
