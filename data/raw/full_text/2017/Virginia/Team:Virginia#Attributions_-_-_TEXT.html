Keith Kozminski, PhD
Team Advisor
Professor, Department of Biology U.Va.
Professor Kozminski has offered a guiding hand as our team designed and executed our project. From teaching a preparatory iGEM course in the spring to advising us and helping us overcome the various obstacles that arise over the course of the competition season, Professor Kozminski has become our teamâ€™s compass, helping our team stay on track.
Jason Papin, PhD
Team Advisor
Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering U.Va.
Along with providing the team with encouragement, Professor Papin has been very helpful in streamlining the modeling. An expert in metabolic cell models, Professor Papin's insight has been instrumental in the course of the development of flux model part of the project.
Kay Christopher
Lab Support
Staff, Department of Biology U.Va.
Ms. Christopher was incredible guide for our team as we traversed us through our team's summer WetLab adventure.  From helping us set up our lab and summer and fall experimentation to providing us with insight as the team was conducting procedures, Ms. Christopher's contributions to our team were incredibly useful to the success of our team over the summer and fall.
The people mentioned here aided us in the design and execution of our project. The lab work, modeling, human practices work, and web design was completed by members of Virginia iGEM 2017.
Wastewater
Tim Castillo was extremely kind to give our team a tour of the Rivanna Wastewater Treatment Plant and gave us deep insight into its operation. He also provided us with a year's worth of monitoring data from RWTP which helped us inform our project, especially the Bioreactor design.
Preparation and Beginning Dates
Our PI, Professor Kozminski, teaches an introductory Synthetic Biology course that all members of the team are required to take.  This class meets for three hours every week.  Basic synthetic biology concepts were introduced and literature was discussed.  Our final project consisted of us teaming up to identify a world issue and then find a synthetic biology solution.  We started this class in January when our spring semester began.
We began brainstorming for our project on May 23rd, and we began our lab work on May 24th.  We started the Interlab study on June 5th, and we started our project on June 12th.
