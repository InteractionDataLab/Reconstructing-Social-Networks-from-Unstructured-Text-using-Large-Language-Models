Interlab Study
At iGEM, Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a widely used reporter for biological circuit constructs. In order to test and observe the level of agreement of GFP expression and measurement around the globe, iGEM organization has been asking teams to collect fluorescence data for many years. This year, we used a plate reader to measure the concentration of GFP in transformed cell samples that express GFP at different rates as the promoter strength in the 6 provided constructs are different. A fluorescein standard curve was generated using the spreadsheet and all data collected are shown on this page and are submitted to the iGEM database for global comparison.
