Basic Parts
BBa_K2272000 - a promoter that is maximally induced under microaerobic condition and regulates the expression of VHb, a bacterial hemoglobin that acts as a terminal oxidase.
BBa_K2272001 - a promoter that regulates the production of MnSOD (mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase), which detoxify radical oxygen produced by mitochondrial respiration.
BBa_K2272002 - this part encodes Hydroxylamine Oxidoreductase (HAO), which catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite
BBa_K2272003 - this part encodes two cytochromes that facilitate electron transport during the nitrification process
BBa_K2272004 - this sequence from Paracoccus denitrificans codes for a signal peptide that will export the tagged protein to the periplasm of the cell
BBa_K2272005 - this sequence from Nitrosomonas europaea codes for a signal peptide that exports the tagged protein to the periplasm of the cell
