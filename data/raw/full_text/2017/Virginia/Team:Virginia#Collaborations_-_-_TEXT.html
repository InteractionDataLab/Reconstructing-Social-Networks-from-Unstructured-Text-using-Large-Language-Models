Collaborations
Delaware
Since the Mid-Atlantic iGEM Meet-Up, we have been working with University of Delaware to help them establish a foundation for their new team.  By establishing this mentorship, we have been helping them by offering them a diverse set of protocols, providing templates/methods for brainstorming and designing iGEM Projects, and have been available for calls discussing qualities of a successful iGEM project.
Manchester
Involvement with Manchester began when they expressed interest in a business model for their device. Our conversations led us to find that there are major differences with regard to GMM laws across the world. Together, we helped synthesize questions that revealed these inconsistencies among nations. Additionally, we researched and submitted summaries detailing United States law with respect to GMMs within the confines of the targeted questions. Our major collaboration, outside of contributing US law, was in developing a cohesive way for demonstrating the differences between countries. A link to this collaboration can be found here.
William and Mary
After our Mid-Atlantic Meet-Up, William and Mary offered us a set of protocols related to Arabinose-inducible promoters, which helped us further characterize the promoters in Paracoccus denitrificans and use the pBAD promoter in our final tested device.
