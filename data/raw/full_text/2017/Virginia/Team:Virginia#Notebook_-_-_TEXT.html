No experiments performed this day
Lab work:
Modeling: after some thinking, brute-force on anything that's larger than 3-4 parameters is just silly. Absolutely don't want to simulate 10^18 nonlinear solutions, a lot of which are going to stall anyway. Eh.
Lab work:
SCOOPED: Discovery of a paper that says HAO does not work the way we originally thought
Lab work:
Modeling: finished the modified model after the talk. Searching for some interesting things to simulate. Parameters were fit using a submodel.
