Meet the team
This year's project is brought to you by these eight wonderful Wahoos!
Vikram Seshadri: Team Captain
2nd year: Biomedical Engineering
"Who needs proper grammar, when you have iGEM!"
David Johanson: Lab Manager
3rd year: Biology & Entrepreneurship Minor
"In my free time? It's been too long... maybe I used to golf. But I lost my golf magic back in high school. What's my favorite Netflix show? Movies. I have my favorite quote though: 'lost in the sauce.'"
Christia Aspili: Human Resources & Graphic Design
3rd year: Neuroscience
"I spend my free time trying to grow out my hair. I hope to have Rapunzel length hair soon so I can go in a tower and have my true love come rescue me."
Lauren Harkins: CFO & Competition Coordinator
2nd year: Biomedical engineering
"My goal in life is to become a mermaid. I've spent countless hours in the pool hoping my legs slowly morph into a tail. So far I've been unsuccessful."
Eric Wang: Lab Manager & Wiki Creator
2nd year: Biochemistry
"No results found for personal bio. Are you looking for microbiology protocols?"
Steven Scherping: Presentation Creator
4th year: Biology, Bioethics minor
"I was the first flutist in the New York Symphony Orchestra. I traveled the world playing my flute. I was the youngest flutist to play in the Sydney Opera House, and the first flutist in fifty years."
Ilya Andreev: Modeling Manager
3rd year: Mathematics & Physics
"When I was back in Russia, I got arrested for having a grandma yell at me. Weird experience."
Caity Embly: Human resources & Presentation Creator

Advisors
Learn about our amazing advisors!
Prof. Keith Kozminski
Ph.D, Yale University, 1995
Professor Kozminski has offered a guiding hand as our team designed and executed our project.  From teaching a preparatory iGEM course in the spring to advising us and helping us overcome the various obstacles that arise over the course of the competition season, Professor Kozminski has become our team’s compass, helping our team stay on track.
Prof. Jason Papin
Ph.D., Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, 2004
Along with providing the team with encouragement, Professor Papin has been very helpful in creating our modelling page.  As one of the University of Virginia’s modelling experts, Professor Papin has been instrumental in helping us design and develop an exceptional modelling subproject.
