Media Outreach
Productively conveying your message with the general public can be achieved by utilizing one of two strategies; either through tailored or far-reaching communication, balancing the level of impact with the width of reached people. While interacting directly with the local community allow one-on-one exchanges and molding of the interaction to the individual, broadcasting through media offers the opportunity of reaching a larger group of the population and in many cases otherwise unreachable individuals. With this in mind, we did not limit our public engagement to local events but contacted different media organizations to aid us in connecting with the public. Our goal remains to inspire and encourage as many people as possible to embrace a more ecoconscious mindset and to highlight the microplastic problem.
To increase the age-span of our potential audience, we decided to utilize different media platforms. In addition to engaging with the news media, we ran three social media sites on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter . We managed to amass several hundred followers that were supplied with a constant stream of microplastic-related articles as well as being kept up-to-date with our progress.
Below follows a selection of articles related to our project.
Ny Teknik
Our progress was highlighted in the industry leading Swedish magazine on Engineering applications Ny Teknik (New Technology). An online version can be found here .

Sveriges Radio P4 is the most popular radio station in Sweden, with 41% of the Swedish population tuning in daily.
