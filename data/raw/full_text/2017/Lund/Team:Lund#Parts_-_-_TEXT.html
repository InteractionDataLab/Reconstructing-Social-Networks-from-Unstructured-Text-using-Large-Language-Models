Part collection
The following constructs were modified to suit the BioBrick standard. Due to time constraints, the parts were not submitted but the sequences were added to the registry to enable future iGEM projects.
Basic parts
GFP1-9
BBa_K2266000
Coding sequence for GFP1-9.
GFP10-hER-α LBD-GFP11
BBa_K2266001
Coding sequence for GFP10-hER-α LBD-GFP11 with 6 amino acids linkers.
Composite parts
GFP1-9 device
BBa_K2266002
Composite part for expression of GFP1-9 under the Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 , with RBS BBa_B0034 .
GFP10-hER-α LBD GFP11 device
BBa_K2266005
Composite part for expression of GFP10-hER-α LBD-GFP11 fusion protein with 6 amino acids linkers under the Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 with RBS BBa_B0034 .
NahR-GFP1-9 device
BBa_K2266003
Composite part for coexpression of NahR and GFP1-9, illustrated in fig. 5. NahR placed under the Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 with RBS BBa_B0034 . GFP1-9 placed under Psal activated upon binding of NahR and inducer salicylate.
NahR-sfGFP device
BBa_K2266004
Composite part for coexpression of NahR and sfGFP, illustrated in fig. 4. NahR placed under the Anderson promoter BBa_J23100 , with RBS BBa_B0034 . sfGFP placed under Psal to be activated upon binding of NahR and inducer salicylate.
