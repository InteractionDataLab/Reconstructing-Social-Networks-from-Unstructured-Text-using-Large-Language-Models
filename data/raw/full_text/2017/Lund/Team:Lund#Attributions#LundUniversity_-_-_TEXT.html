Main advisors
We would like to extend a special thank you to our advisors that has offered us support and insight throughout the project.
Professor Leif B√ºlow, Division of Pure and Applied Biochemistry at Lund University
For providing us with the opportunity to participate in the iGEM competition by allowing us access to the laboratory equipment at the department of Applied Biochemistry and facilitating the implementation of the iGEM project as an upper-level course of 15 ECTS.
Dr. Ed Van Niel, Department of Applied Microbiology at Lund University
For insightful conversations throughout the project design phase and providing us access to the laboratory equipment at the department of Applied Microbiology. We also appreciated the stroopwafel cookies that we were always offered upon visiting the department.
Dr. N√©lida Leiva Eriksson, Division of Pure and Applied Biochemistry at Lund University
For support throughout the wet-lab portion of the project. Dr. Leiva Eriksson helped us design and, when necessary, troubleshoot our laboratory protocols and procedures and always made sure to take time out of her schedule to assist us in evaluating our generated results. In addition to mentoring us in the lab, Dr. Leiva Eriksson was a constant source of motivation and inspiration. A heartfelt thank you from all of us!
