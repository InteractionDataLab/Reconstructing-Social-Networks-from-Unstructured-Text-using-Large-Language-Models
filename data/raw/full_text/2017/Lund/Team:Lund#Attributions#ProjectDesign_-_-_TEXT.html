Project Design
Microplastics has been target of many iGEM projects over the past couple of years, scaling with the surge in interest from both the scientific community and the general public relating to the uncovering of the adverse environmental effects of the particles. To ensure that our project would not only meet a previously unmet need but also to optimize the chances of success, we looked at previous iGEM projects and analyzed what had been done and to what degree of prosperity. In combination with reported scientific research and input from both informed scientists and industry, we set out realize our project. We want to thank and acknowledge the following people and groups for positively shaping the course of the project design.
For a comprehensive elaboration of the impact on our project, see Integrated Practices .
Professor Kenneth M. Persson, Division of Water Resource Management at Lund University
For insight into the complexity concerning microplastics and the existing academic uncertainty regarding both their hypothesized and observed environmental effects.
Sofia Lind, R&D manager at Veolia Water Technologies AB
For a thorough examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the water treatment facilities in Lund municipality.
The iGEM 2012 University College London team
The iGEM 2012 UCL team recognized the viability of using the NahR transcriptional regulator of the naphthalene degrading operon NAH7 found in Pseudomonas as a sensing element for organic pollutants, which we incorporated into the design of our biosensor. Thus, they played a pivotal r√¥le in the final project design.
Professor Huimin Zhao, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
For graciously providing us with the gene sequence for the hER-ùõº LBD upon request.
Dr. N√©lida Leiva Eriksson, Division of Pure and Applied Biochemistry at Lund University
For providing us with helpful suggestion for linker sequences for the construction of our chimeric protein.
