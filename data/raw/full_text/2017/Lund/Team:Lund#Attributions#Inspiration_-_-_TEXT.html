Inspiration
The iGEM competition promotes a comprehensive project covering many of the facets that a working scientist has to be aware of while designing, conducting and presenting their research. However, as this was the first foray into real scientific work for the most of us, we felt the need to look outwards and talk to various professionals for inspiration and motivation to ensure that we not only conduct ourselves appropriately as scientists but also get the most out of the iGEM experience. We want to thank everyone that offered their insight into the different aspects of the competition.

Olle Bergman, rhetorician and Lund University alumni
For excellent suggestions on how to appropriately present research and how to convey it to the general public in an efficient and engaging manner. Mr. Bergman’s positivity, wit and jovial manner served as an endless source of motivation, entertainment and inspiration.
