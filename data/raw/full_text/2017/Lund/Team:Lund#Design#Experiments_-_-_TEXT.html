Overview
In order to design a cohesive experimental plan, we begun by defining the parameters of interest. This was done with the intention of             finding what constructs were necessary to not only generate parameter-data to fit the model but evaluate our parts both qualitatively and,             when applicable, quantitatively.
In silico indications
Through simulations of our intended construct with parameters defined a priori, we were able to draw some conclusions as to the validity             of our system as a microplastic biosensor and generated some insight into the expected behavior which we could apply in the wet-lab             setting.              The model reflected very high dose sensitivity with regards to both ligands, which serves as an indicator that our system ought to work as             a microplastic sensor. While we naturally expect lower affinity than that of the simulated natural ligands, it should still display             somewhat similar characteristics. This is important as the concentrations of measured homologues will most likely be low. Thus, we can             pass up on introducing positive autoregulatory motifs to our intended network topology.              The rise-time of the GFP concentration suggests a slowly forming output signal, with over 10 hours before it reaches 90% of steady-state             concentration (for varying concentrations of ligands). Thus, our fluorescence readings will have to be conducted first after several hours -             most likely 10 hours post induction. Furthermore, improving the kinetics of a single node in our network will not particularly change the             association time of GFP. That is to say, we do not need to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù any genes, for example through mutagenesis or simply changing some             sequence to one with similar function, in an attempt to decrease the time to output signal as it will most likely not work.              The IPTG concentrations will affect the overall gene transactivation and the associated GFP concentration. Thus, to achieve measureable results, we will use a relative high concentration corresponding to that of at least 1 mM.
Control construct design
In this section we introduce the constructs intended to be used as controls. The gene architecture is designed to best generate parameters to fit the model and evaluate individual gene behaviors.
The pETDuet-1 vector was chosen for all desired protein expressions in this project as recommended by our advisor Dr. N√©lida Leiva Eriksson. Genes were           synthesized at Eurofins Genomics and cloned into the pETDuet-1 vector using the restriction site pairs NcoI/BamHI and NdeI/AatII. The restriction           sites were chosen based on their location downstream the two T7 promoters. In addition, it was required that these restriction enzymes were single           site cutters which was ensured by using the RestrictionMapper online tool. All the gene sequences used were codon optimized for E.           coli by using Eurofins‚Äô and IDT‚Äôs codon optimization tools prior to ordering the constructs. Furthermore, all genes encoding a protein were chosen to be ended with the double stop codon, TAA TAA.
NahR
The control plasmid carries the nahR gene with a histidine tag, located under the T7 promoter. The purpose of this control plasmid was to             see if it is possible to induce expression of NahR, using the drawn-up design illustrated in fig. 1. By utilizing the His-tag,             the protein could be purified in order to determine its concentration.
The DNA sequence for the NahR protein was obtained from the BioBrick part BBa_K228004 .

sfGFP
The construct with superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) located under the T7 promoter, as depicted in fig. 2, was constructed to be used as a positive reference for the fluorescence signal.

GFP1-9
The purpose of expressing the largest fragment of the tripartite split-GFP was to examine if the protein emit any fluorescence signal and             if so, how large the fluorescence signal is compared to one from the sfGFP. A His-tag with 6 histidine residues was added to enable             purification and measurements of protein concentration. Construct illustrated in fig. 3.
The DNA sequence for the tripartite split GFP was obtained from a study by Cabantous et al. (2013) [40].

NahR with sfGFP under Psal promoter
This control construct, illustrated in fig. 4 was designed in order to investigate if added salicylate increases the transcription rate of             the reporter protein. Furthermore, the purpose was to examine the level of leaky expression obtained with no salicylate added. As             explained in the theory section, NahR binds to and activates the Psal promoter in presence of salicylate resulting in expression of the             reporter protein, in this case sfGFP.
The DNA sequences for sfGFP and Psal promoter were obtained from SnapGene‚Äôs Plasmid file and NCBI‚Äôs database , respectively.

NahR with GFP1-9 under Psal promoter
Construct with NahR expressed under the T7 promoter and GFP1-9 located under the Psal promoter, as illustrated in fig. 5. The purpose of             this control was to confirm the expression of GFP1-9 as a result from activation of the Psal promoter.

GFP10-hER-ùõÇ LBD-GFP11
The control was constructed to confirm expression of the fusion protein GFP10-hER-Œ± LBD-GFP11, illustrated in fig. 6. The protein is             attached to a 6 histidine residue tag to facilitate purification and consequently allow concentration measurements.   The DNA sequence for             the hER-Œ± LBD was kindly provided by Dr. Huimin Zhao upon request.

GFP1-9 + GFP10-hER-Œ± LBD-GFP11 device
Construct with GFP1-9 and GFP10-hER-Œ± LBD-GFP11, each located under a T7 promoter. This control was designed to investigate the reassembling of the tripartite split GFP and measure its fluorescence.

Intended experiments
Induce cell culture with different IPTG concentrations at several OD600 values to find an optimal condition for protein expression. SDS-PAGE would be performed for rough estimation of protein amounts.
Purify His-tagged proteins - NahR (fig. 1), GFP1-9 (fig. 3) and GFP10-hER-Œ± LBD-GFP11 (fig. 6), with Immobilized Metal ions Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and thereafter perform protein concentration measurements using spectrophotometer.
Using fluorometer to measure fluorescence signal of sfGFP (fig. 2) and GFP1-9 (fig. 3).
Investigate the expression rate of sfGFP (fig. 4) and GFP1-9 (fig. 5) by using several concentrations of inducer salicylate as well as examine the leaky expression in absence of salicylate.
Use tamoxifen as an antagonistic ligand to investigate whether the conformational change of the GFP10-hER-Œ± LBD-GFP11 construct happens. The conformational change causing reassembly of the tripartite split GFP would result in fluorescence signal, measured with fluorometer. The same experiment would be performed without added tamoxifen in order to see whether the conformational change is needed for the tripartite split GFP to reassemble.
