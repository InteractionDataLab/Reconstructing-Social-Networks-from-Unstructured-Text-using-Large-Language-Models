Mentorship
Thank you to Clayton Moore and Dr. Cezar Khursigara with your help getting iGEM started and completing all of our required tasks to participate.
A special thanks to Jenelle Patterson for her mentorship and assistance in laboratory experiments this summer.  Without her guidance and words of wisdom our team would still be stuck on Step 1 of our experiment with nothing to show for an entire summer's worth of work. Thank you so much for everything you have done and we wish you the best in your future endeavors Jenelle!
