Team members: Gui Yijun, Liang Chenxi, Liu Hengxin, Li Kaiming, Luo Qi, Sun Xuedi, Wu Jincheng, Zhang Zhihui
Leading the team
Zhou Yu founded the team and recruited the members. He allocated assignments to us  based on our skills and interests. There is no doubt that his outstanding leadership ensured everything proceeded according to plan.
Experiment
Every one of us has participated in experiments.
Wiki
Liu Hengxin worked on the establishment and the art design of the website. Luo Qi, Zhang Zhihui, Li Kaiming, Gui Yijun and Wu Jincheng participated in web copywriting.
Poster
Liang Chenxi, Luo Qi and Gui Yijun was responsible for writing the texts in our poster, yet Liu Hengxin and Liang Chenxi were in charge of the design of it. They cooperated very well.
Human practice
Gui Yijun, Liang Chenxi, Wu Jincheng, Zhou Yu and our instructor Chen Xi all went to the interview in the hospital with professionals. Liu Hengxin analyzed the data online obtained through web-crawling technique to dig into people’s attitude towards weight-losing. All of us made questionaires and distributed them out. Gui Yijun, Liang Chenxi, Luo Qi and Zhou Yu went to the CCiC held by Fujian Agriculture and Foresty University, where they got acquainted with other teams’ projects and learned a lot.
Presentation
Liang Chenxi, Luo Qi and Gui Yijun made the speech PPT and will give the presentations during the competition altogether.
Instructors
Zhou Yu : He founded the team and recruited the members. He allocated assignments to us everyone based on our strengths and interests. There is no doubt that his outstanding leadership ensured everything that needed to be done would get done.
PI
Chen Xi : He is an amazing and inspiring teacher. Thanks to his encouragement, we are eager to put forward innovative ideas and voice our own opinions about the ongoing work. Besides, what impresses us most is that he helps us patiently whenever we have trouble with our projects. He offers so much support and help, from the construction of the whole experimental frame to the references we choose. And I believe that’s why our project went well.
Chenyu Zhang : Professor Zhang is well-known for his research and development work about microRNAs. He provided us with experimental instruments and equipment. What’s more, he gave the guidance on the human practice and had contacted relevant authorities to guarantee all the activities in the plan could be on the rail. All of us feel very grateful for that.
