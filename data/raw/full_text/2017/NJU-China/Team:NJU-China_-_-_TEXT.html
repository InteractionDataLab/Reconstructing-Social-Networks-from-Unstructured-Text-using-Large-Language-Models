Obesity problem has become increasingly prevalant these years and arouses widespread concern. Traditional methodsare either easy to rebound or associated with side effects, while other effective treatment of obesity has not appeared yet so far. The goal of our project is to develop a new strategy to treat obesity, with building a transplantable system targeting white fat tissues. We packed siRNA into exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by human cells). Then we modified our exosome with a certain peptide targeting white-fat-tissue. The siRNA will cause the apoptosis of fat tissue. Our validation experiments will be carried out at the level of cells and animals (mice). Eventually, we expect to see a specific accumulation of the siRNA in the mice’s white fat tissue and the decrease of mice’s fat and their weights. This project may provide new insights into future treatment of obesity.
