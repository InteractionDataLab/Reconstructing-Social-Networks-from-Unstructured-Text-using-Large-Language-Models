Protocol
Plasmid transfection and extraction of exosomes
HEK 293 cells were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks(Biofil) at 37℃, 5% CO2.When the cells reached approximately 70-80% confluence, they were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Tpep and Bcl2 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cell culture medium was then harvested 48 h after transfection, and the exosomes loaded with Bcl2 siRNA were harvested from the medium using an exosome isolation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in PBS.

Transmission electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy analysis, the exosome samples were prepared as described above. Briefly, the exosome pellet was placed in a droplet of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer and fixed overnight at 4 °C. The exosome samples were rinsed 3 times in PBS for 10 min each and then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 60 min at room temperature. Then, the samples were embedded in 10% gelatine, fixed in glutaraldehyde at 4 °C and cut into small blocks (less than 1 mm3). The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of alcohol. Then, the samples were placed in propylene oxide and infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Quetol-812 epoxy resin mixed with propylene oxide for 3 h per step. Finally, the samples were embedded in pure, fresh Quetol-812 epoxy resin and polymerised at 35 °C for 12 h, 45 °C for 12 h, and 60 °C for 24 h. Ultrathin sections were cut using a Leica UC6 ultra-microtome and stained with uranyl acetate for 10 min and lead citrate for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were then observed with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1010) at a voltage of 80 kV.
Validation in vivo.
To construct a obesity mouse model, we select one month old mice in normal weight, provide them with high-fat diet. The mice were divided into 4 groups, group I was injected with PBS, group II egfr exosome, group III and group IV Bcl2 siRNA- tpep exosome.  Exosomes with tpep on the membrane and Bcl2 siRNA inside was injected through caudal vein every two days. The dosage received is 100ul at the concentration of 1000ng/ul. Weight data was collected everyday. Three weeks later, the mice was killed by ether anesthesia, blood was sampled by removing the eyeball, heart, liver, kidney, lung, spleen and adipose tissue was separated for further reaserch.
ITT
Starvation treatment in group IV for 6 hours, intraperitoneally inject insulin 0.75 unit per kg, Took blood sample form tail end and measure blood glucose at the time of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 mins.
GTT
Starvation treatment overnight and intraperitoneally inject glucose, the following step is the same as ITT
Targeting verification in vivo
4 mice were divided into two groups, group I was injected through caudal vein with 100ul egfr siRNA exosome(egfr siRNA 1000ng/ul), group II was injected with 100ul egfr siRNA- tpep exosome. 12 hours later, the mice were dissected and their liver, heart, kidney, spleen, lung and adipose tissue were separated. Total RNA was extracted by trizol and reverse transcription was carried out, then Qpcr was used to compare the egfr expression in adipose tissue and in other tissues.
Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
Sample preparation: Dilute the sample until the liquid is clear, colorless and transparent, control the particle concentration at 10^7-10^8particles/ml. Usually, when there is less than 100 particles in the capture field, the results will be more convincing.
We use NS300(Malvern) to run the sample, choose appropriate Top-plate and O-ring, use 1ml injection to load 600ul-800ul sample, click start camera, adjust the focus and choose appropriate screen gain and camera level until there is DARK signal on the top right corner of the window. Set up other advanced parameters( usually, keep the original parameter), click start and run.
When the three times measurement is finished, adjust the threshold value left side panel until there are less than 5 blue label in the vision, click OK and export data.
