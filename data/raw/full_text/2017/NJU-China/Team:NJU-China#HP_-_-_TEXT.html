Human Practice
Our human practice involves social activity and public engagement. We work on promotion of the knowledge for targeted therapy and survey on people’s attitude towards all the weight loss program which includes our work. Besides, we get in touch with doctor and patients to establish contact with clinical treatment.
Obesity has become increasingly disturbing and common these years since it gets in the way of people pursuing beauty and health. To improve our project ulteriorly and help people practically, we worked on the publicity of targeted therapeutics and the surveys of people’s attitudes towards various weight-losing methods or efforts. Additionally, we communicated with doctors and patients in person to acquire more information about clinical treatments, hoping to know more about the feasibility of our targeted therapeutics.
