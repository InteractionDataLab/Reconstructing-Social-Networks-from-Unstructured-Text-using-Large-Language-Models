Conceptual Framework
Our goal with was to make a toolkit as a head-start for other groups to work with paratransgenesis, making designs that can be adapted to target other pathogens and hosts. In this section of the wiki we show the design considerations behind each part of the toolkit, and different possibilities in each part.
An important part of the design of a paratransgenesis project, before the genetic circuit itself, is the choice of the chassis for the implementation of this method. We searched for various bacteria used on previous work and ended up choosing Pantoea agglomerans as our little Trojan horse. But different hosts and applications require different bacteria, so see more about this choice and other chassis possibilities here.
A good chassis doesn’t matter if it doesn’t do anything! For the circuit, we divided the design in three modules, each with a range of possibilities discussed in their respective pages. The modules were:
A detection module
An effector module
A kill-switch module
All this design considerations must pass through modeling to validate the feasibility of the design. In our modelling page , we talk about aspects important to consider while attempting modeling of a paratransgenesis project. From molecular to populational, all levels matter!
