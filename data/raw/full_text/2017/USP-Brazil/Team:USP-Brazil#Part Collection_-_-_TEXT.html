Paratransgenesis Collection
The diversity of vector-borne diseases imposes a great challenge for the development of efficient tools. But we are here to help!
We present here the Paratransgenesis Collection, a collection of parts, new and gathered from the Registry of Parts, useful for any project tackling tropical diseases.
