Chassis
For a successful “Trojan Horse” approach to eliminate diseases, the choice of the proper horse is essential. And there are a lot of good options, ready to be tinkered with by the iGEM community!
An ideal chassis for controlling population of parasites should be:
Easy to cultivate and modify
Naturally adapted to your targeted insect species
Non pathogenic for humans, animals or plants
Transmissible vertically and horizontally in your targeted population
Here we provide a list of possible chassis characterized for future synthetic biology work:
Table of chassis
Ideal organismus
Pantoea agglomerans
Serratia sp.
Targets: Any disease
Literature example: -
Bio Safety Level 1
Relation with vector: Obligatory symbiont, all insects that transmit one disease
Engineering score (0-5) : 5 (as fast and good as E. coli)
Insect to insect transmisson: Vertical and horizontal
Targets: Malaria, Denge, Zika, Others
Previous use: (1)
Bio Safety Level 1 or 2
Relation with vector: Extracellular commensal, Anopheles; Aedes; found ubiquitously
Engineering score (0-5) : 4.5 (works with pSB1C3 series!)
Insect to insect transmisson: Incomplete evidence
Targets: Malaria
Previous use: (2)
Bio Safety Level 1 or 2
Relation with vector: Extracellular commensal, Anopheles; found ubiquitously
Engineering score (0-5) : 4 (doubling time of 49 min, (3))
Insect to insect transmisson: Incomplete evidence
Sodalis sp
Asaia sp
Rhodococcus rhodnii
Targets: African Sleeping Sicknes (Trypanosoma brucei )
Literature example: (4)
Bio Safety Level 1
Relation with vector: Secondary symbiont, Glossina sp
Engineering score (0-5) : 2 (doubling time of 15 hours)
Insect to insect transmisson: Vertical and horizontal(5)
Targets: Malaria, Flavescence Dorée
Previous use: iGEM Team EPFL 2010 (6)
Bio Safety Level 1 or 2
Relation with vector: Extracellular commensal, Anopheles sp., Scaphoideus titanus Engineering score (0-5) : 3 (Doubling time of 2h40min)
Insect to insect transmisson: Incomplete evidence
Targets: Chagas' disease
Previous use: (7)
Bio Safety Level 1
Relation with vector: Extracellular commensal, Rhodnius prolixus
Engineering score (0-5) : 2 (slow growth (8))
Insect to insect transmisson: Incomplete evidence
Metarhizium anisopliae
Densonucleosis virus
Alcaligenes sp.
Targets: Malaria and others
Literature example: (9)
Bio Safety Level 1
Relation with vector:Pathogen, broad host insect range
Engineering score (0-5) : 2 (filamentous fungi)
Insect to insect transmisson: Horizontal (10)
Targets: Malaria
Previous use: (11)
Bio Safety Level 1
Relation with vector: Weak pathogen (12) of Anopheles gambiae , varieties may infect other insects
Engineering score (0-5) : 3 (can be fully synthetized, but needs mosquito cell culture)
Insect to insect transmisson: Incomplete evidence
Targets: Citrus Variegate Chlorosis, Pierce's disease (Xylella fastidiosa)
Previous use: (13)
Bio Safety Level 1 or 2
Relation with vector: Extracellular commensal, Hemiptera: Cicadellidae family; xylem of plants
Engineering score (0-5) : 3
Insect to insect transmisson: Incomplete evidence
But remember, the sky is the limit! iGEM teams could use metagenomics and public databases to develop great chassis for specific challenges. Developing tools for new organisms is challenging, but the reward could be the virtual elimination of pathogenic species. Good, isn’t it?
In our experimental part, we used for the first time the organism Pantoea agglomerans in iGEM, as an example of interesting chassis. Check it out here.
