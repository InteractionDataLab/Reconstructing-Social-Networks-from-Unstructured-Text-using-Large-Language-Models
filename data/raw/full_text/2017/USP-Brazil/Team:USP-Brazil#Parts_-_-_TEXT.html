Parts
We designed a variety of parts for our circuit’s modules, with uses ranging from pathogen detection, elimination, to kill switch parts for containment of our bacteria.
We also gathered a collection of possible effectors to be used in paratransgenesis projects.
Of all of these parts, here are some of our favorite ones:
BBa_K2486000 : Scorpine with a type1 secretion system signal peptide. Scorpine is a multi-target lytic peptide derived from the scorpion Pandinus imperator. It shows promising activity against Plasmodium and some bacteria.
BBa_K2486004 : A part that constitutively generates DtxR ( BBa_K2486005 ) regulator. Its expression is controlled by a medium strength promoter ( BBa_J23108 ) and a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ).
BBa_K2486005 : This part is composed by the dtxR regulator coding sequence, the part binds to its cognate operator in the presence of Fe2+ repressing it, which is present in our synthetic PdtxR promoter ( BBa_K2486023 ).
BBa_K2486007 : A part that constitutively generates LldR ( BBa_K1847001 ) regulator. Its expression is controlled by a weak promoter ( BBa_J23108 ) and a strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ).
BBa_K2486009 : This part inverts the signal produced by the interaction between DtxR protein and the cognate operator, through the repression of TetR expression in the presence of Fe2+. To obtain this result you could combine this part with parts BBa_K2486004 and BBa_K2486011 .
BBa_K2486010 : This part is a reporter module based on our promoter BBa_K2486011 and a GFP with lva tag. It’s a proof of concept that we can indeed produce circuits regulated by metabolites for use in paratransgenesis.
BBa_K2486011 : This part is awesome! It’s a promoter that presents operator regions for TetR and lldR. It can be used with our parts BBa_K2486004 , BBa_K2486009 and BBa_K2486007 producing an AND gate for lactate and Fe2+.
BBa_K2486177 . A toehold-switch RNA with a lac promoter activated by part BBa_K2486179 . Besides, it works in P. agglomerans !
