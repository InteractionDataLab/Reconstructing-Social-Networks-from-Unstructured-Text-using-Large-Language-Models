Collaborations
Collaborating  with other iGEM teams is an essential part of the iGEM process, and also lots of fun! Check our different collaborations down here:
Brazilian iGEM WhatsApp Network :
After organizing the Brazilian Meet-Up, Jamboré Brasuca , a group in the application WhatsApp was formed together with members of 6 different synthetic biology “hubs” in Brazil, with teams UNESP-Araraquara and team Amazonas_Brazil . Moreover, the hubs of UFMG, USP-EEL and Esalq/iGEM, and Guilherme Kundlatsch, iGEM “ambassador” in Brazil  are also actively participating. On top of this, people from nascent synthetic biology hubs are always being added. It is really exciting to see the community growing strong!
The group has been used for sharing and solving issues from the bench to hotel reservations in Boston, deadline reminders and sharing surveys. And, of course, sharing "memes" and other iGEM related puns, to make the intense lab work more fun. It was great to have this direct channel of communications uniting teams as far as 2600 km (!) from each other, but still inside Brazil.
Amazonas-Brazil Team collaboration
The Amazonas_Brazil team gently provided an amazonian strain of our host species, Pantoea agglomerans, as well as compatible plasmids.  We were able to transform our strain with the iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid, but we are very grateful to them for the help! In turn we sent them the L-arabinose they needed to test their construct, as they did not have this resource available. This two way collaboration was great for both teams!
Wageninger UR Team collaboration
The Wageningen UR Team contacted us asking for help with their human practices, as they are developing a diagnostic test kit for Zika and other diseases, they wanted to know more about the issues in dealing with infectious diseases and whether their technology could help to tackle some of these issues. We talked about personal experiences and also managed to speak to Tatiana Mingote, from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and forward her answers to the dutch team's questions. We also exchanged thoughts and experiences about our projects and got some ideas of complementartity of our technologies, which both aim to help the fight against infectious diseases.
IONIS-PARIS Team collaboration
We had a great skype talk, followed by further conversations, with team IONIS-Paris which is working with temperature driven sensors to cope with climate impact on agriculture. For their Human Practices , they had a plethora of good questions about GMO regulation laws as well as the innovation atmosphere in synthetic biology in our country. It was great to contribute to such an interesting human practices approach.
