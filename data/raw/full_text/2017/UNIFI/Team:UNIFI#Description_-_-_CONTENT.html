In particular the idea is to create three E. coli strains, expressing three fluorescent proteins (GFP, RFP, CFP) under an oscillating circuit of quorum sensing molecules (AHL), further activated by IPTG, tetracycline and copper.</P><P>We expect the oscillator system to move along the space of phases (defined by the concentrations of IPTG, tet and Cu) in both a predictable way (periodic oscillator), but also as eventually unpredictable (small differences at the beginning giving large differences in the timing of fluorescence), producing chaotic behavior.</P><P>The patterns of the emitted fluorescence by the co-culture will be used as input signal for a colour-to-sound translation software. In addition we are able to interfere with the gene network by changing the initial concentrations of one or more substrate and by doing that many original outputs can be achieved. The end will be a somewhat &quot;unpredictable&quot; &quot;son et lumi√®re&quot; show.</P></H1><H1>Description</H1><P>Tell us about your project, describe what moves you and why this is something important for your team.</P><H5>What should this page contain?</H5><UL><LI> A clear and concise description of your project.</LI><LI>A detailed explanation of why your team chose to work on this particular project.</LI><LI>References and sources to document your research.</LI><LI>Use illustrations and other visual resources to explain your project.</LI></UL></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H5>Advice on writing your Project Description</H5><P>
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements. 
</P><P>
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5>References</H5><P>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H5>Inspiration</H5><P>See how other teams have described and presented their projects: </P><UL><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College/Description">2016 Imperial College</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Description">2016 Wageningen UR</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project_Overview"> 2014 UC Davis</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Overview">2014 SYSU Software</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
