All the students are from the Biomolecular Biotechnology Bachelor, except two from the Master’s Degree. In the lab and in the organization the team is supported by a qualified Genetical Engineering professor, Alessio Mengoni and a post-doc, Elena Perrin. For the software the team has the support of Simone Chiesi, chemical engineer and team advisor.
It is the first time for the University of Florence to participate in such an important event like the iGEM competition and we are very excited about it! We are a very determined and united group since we share the same love for the Biotech world and for art in all of its forms!</P></CENTER></DIV><H2 style="font-size: 3vw; margin-left:14vw;padding:1.5vw; background-color: #99ffdd;">Teammates</H2><DIV id="colonnello" style="background-color: #99ffdd;"><DIV class="riga" style="margin-left: 15vw; margin-right: 5vw;"><DIV class="cella"><H3 style="font-size: 20px;"> Lorenzo</H3><P style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"> Hi all!

 biological systems are really smart! In the meanwhile I'm a commuter so I don't have so many time for my hobbies (and for these reason I can't wait to move in my University's city!), 
but I like to cook and go to the gym because I believe in &quot;mens sana in corpore sano&quot;!</P></DIV><DIV class="cella"><H3 style="font-size: 20px;"> Deborah</H3><P style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">Hi everybody! My name is Deborah, I attend the third year of Biomolecular Biotechnology at the University of Florence. I' m a very curious person, for this reason I love the reserch's world, because you can always
 achieve new goals. This thing is very important for my life because I easily get bored of doing repetitive things.
I also have other interests outside the science's world: I like fitness, drawing clothes, and fournishing houses but i have little time for this hobbies because I dedicate the most part of my days to my greater 
passion: the Biotech.
The iGEM competition is a very exciting experience for me, because it stimulates the creativity of people's minds and it is an opportunity for young students to discover a part of the scientific world. GOOD LUCK to my team!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="riga" style="margin-left: 15vw; margin-right: 5vw;"><DIV class="cella"><H3 style="font-size: 20px;"> Tommaso</H3><P style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">I'm Tommaso and I'm attending the third year of Biomolecular Biotechnology at the University of Florence.

My name is Chiara, I'm 22 years old and I live in Prato, a Tuscan city near Florence. I deeply believe that biotechnology is a unique and fascinating world. Taking part to iGEM is for me a great opportunity to exchange ideas with other students and to get to know new aspects of this world. My current position in the Unifi team is to write sections of Wiki, such as the introduction and the descripition of the molecular mechanism behind our project. In the first months of this project I actively participated in foundraising. Even if  we didn't achieve the desidered goal, it was a valuable experience. 
Talking about me, I spend most of my time studying but in my free time I love reading and travelling, specially during the summer holiday. In my everyday life, I don't like spending much time at home, because I get easily bored. So while I study for my exams I prefer to go to the uni to meet my classmates and study together or just have a coffee and a chat.</P></DIV><DIV class="cella"><H3 style="font-size: 20px;"> Valentina</H3><P style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;">Hi guys!
