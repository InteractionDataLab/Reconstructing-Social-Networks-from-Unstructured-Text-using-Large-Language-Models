Celebrated as the birthplace of Renaissance, the city is home to many of its most famous artistic treasures. Florence was first settled by Romans in 59 BC nearby the river Arno and its name comes from the latin “Florentia” which literally translated means “flower”, in this case with the meaning of “flowering city”. It’s a popular destination for tourists and students of art and culture, since the whole city is an open-air museum. The most visited sights are:
