Additionally we could show that the shRNA does not affect the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Demonstrate">transiently reintroduced <I>HIF1A</I></A> in HEK293T cells.</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results"><H3>Kill Switch</H3></A><P>As a key part of our Integrated Human Practice, we achieved an improvement in safety of our CARTEL<SUP>TM</SUP> T cells. By stably expressing <I>herpes simplex virus 1</I> thymidine kinase, we achieved the specific elimination of modified cells via administration of ganciclovir. </P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results"><H3>Stable Cell Lines</H3></A><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results">Stable cell lines</A> for promoter characterization, knockdown of <I>HIF1A</I> and a kill switch were generated via <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Cell_culture">lentiviral transduction</A> and sorted by <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Cell_culture">FACS</A>.

</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results"><H3>Promoter Characterization</H3></A><P>We constructed and tested the activation of the promoters <I>CRE</I>, <I>CTLA4</I> and <I>HRE</I> by acidity, VEGF and hypoxia, respectively. Responsiveness to these inputs was characterized in Jurkat, HEK293T and CHO-K1 cell lines.</P></DIV><DIV class="item"><H2>Requirements for a Gold Medal</H2><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/HP/Gold_Integrated"><H3>Integrated Human Practice</H3></A><P>The goal of CARTEL<SUP>TM</SUP> is to create a safer immune-based therapy. Hearing many concerns about the safety of our project and conducting a <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/HP/Gold_Integrated">survey</A>, we integrated further safety precautions. The survey also confirmed the importance and the need for immunotherapies, which have potential to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. We successfully tested a construct containing a thymidine kinase which makes our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/CAR">T cells</A> sensitive to <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results">ganciclovir</A> induced apoptosis. We went over a realistic embedment of our project in the context of acceptance and side effects. Additionally, we evaluated possibilities to optimize the manufacturing process of CAR T cells with the aim to contribute to a therapy, which is affordable and versatile in its use for many cancer patients.</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Improve"><H3>Improve a previous part or project</H3></A><P>
Improving a previous part was done by sending in <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2295003" target=" _blank">BBa_K2295003</A>. With this BioBrick we improved <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1720002" target=" _blank">BBa_K1720002</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1456004" target=" _blank">BBa_K1456004</A>. The insertion of the <I>pTal</I> promoter, as well as the usage of multiple enhancer elements offer a wide range of new functionalities. Now, hypoxia dependent gene expression can be achieved with a single cloning step. Furthermore, multiple enhancer elements allow fine tuning of the required expression levels to different cell types. 
</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Model"><H3>Model your project</H3></A><P>Modeling was an important part of our project with which we could determine whether our understanding of the system has a good substantiation.  Combining the hypoxia response element, <I>cAMP response element</I> and <I>CTLA4</I> promoter in our CARTEL<SUP>TM</SUP> AND gate to boost the specificity of the CAR expression, was challenging. After modeling different possibilities and comparing the results we designed an AND gate were <I>HIF1A</I> is knocked out and reintroduced under the control of either the <I>cAMP response element</I> promoter or the <I>CTLA4</I> promoter. By this usage of modeling, we aim to improve the safety and specificity of emerging synthetic CAR therapies.</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Demonstrate"><H3>Demonstrate your work</H3></A><P>We could demonstrate that all parts of our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Design">AND gate</A> are functional. In the course of summer we generated stable <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results"><I>HIF1A</I> knockdown</A> Jurkat and HEK293T cell lines, transfected them with an artificially overexpressed HIF1A and could show that it is still functional. We characterized the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results"><I>CRE</I>, <I>CTLA4</I> and the <I>HRE</I> promoter</A> in newly generated stable cell lines and implemented a <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results">kill switch</A> for additional safety of our CARTEL<SUP>TM</SUP> AND gate.
</P></DIV><DIV class="item"><H2>Requirements for a Silver Medal</H2><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Basic_Part"><H3>Validated Part/Validated Contribution</H3></A><P>As a validated contribution we sent in <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2295001" target="_blank">BBa_K2295001</A> (<I>CRE</I> promoter) and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2295002" target="_blank">BBa_K2295002</A> (HIF1A). The functionality of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2295001" target="_blank">BBa_K2295001</A> was shown by flow cytometry with a eCFP reporter downstream of the <I>CRE</I> promoter.  
With a western blot <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2295002" target="_blank">BBa_K2295002</A> was validated. Wild type HEK293T cells as well as our stable <I>HIF1A</I> knockdown HEK293T cell lines contained more HIF1A after transfection with <A href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K2295001" target="_blank">BBa_K2295001</A> under a <I>CMV</I> promoter, while western blot showed nearly no HIF1A in untransfected knockdown cells. The synthetic HIF1A can be stabilized by simulation of hypoxia. </P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Collaborations"><H3>Collaboration</H3></A><P>Collaborations were an important part of our project, which helped us to improve our own project but also to help other teams to reach their goals. In two meaningful bidirectional collaborations with the teams from the ETH Zurich and Heidelberg University, we were able to fulfill this criteria. 
To help Team Heidelberg with their mutagenesis project, we performed mutagenesis experiments with <I>E. coli</I> in order to test the mutagenicity of different plasmids, while Team Heidelberg helped us with the cloning of a plasmid. 
In the collaboration with Team Zurich, we performed a killing assay with azurin on HEK293T cells in order to show the toxicity of the protein used by Team Zurich for their cancer treatment. In return, Team Zurich helped us to create a model which shows the time the CAR is still expressed on T cells in the case they leave the microenvironment.</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/HP/Silver"><H3>Human Practice</H3></A><P>As our project deals with a major research topic, we wanted to involve the society into our project. In order to get an overall opinion about synthetic biology, immunology and cancer we conducted two surveys and got into dialogue with people on the Science Fair in Freiburg and at the Science Days in Europa Park. Thus, we were able to hear about the concerns about our project, which we used to improve our project. In addition to that, we talked with experts in the fields of oncology and CAR T cells, to discuss whether our project is useful and how we can improve it to be more safe for potential clinical trials.</P></DIV><DIV class="item"><H2>Requirements for a Bronze Medal</H2><H3><B>Register and attend</B></H3><P>We registered our team, had an amazing summer and we are coming to the Giant Jamboree!</P><H3><B>Deliverables</B></H3><P>We met all the deliverables.</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Attributions"><H3>Attribution</H3></A><P>We created a page on our wiki with attribution of each aspect of our project which as well contains our gratitude toward all the people and institutions that supported us.</P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/InterLab"><H3>Characterization/Contribution</H3></A><P>We participated in the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/InterLab">Interlab Study</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
