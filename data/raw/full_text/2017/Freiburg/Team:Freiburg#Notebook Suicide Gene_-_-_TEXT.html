Gel Preparation
Heat up 85 ml (small) or 120 ml (big) 1 x TAE-Buffer with 1 mass percent Agarose in the microwave until the Agarose has dissolved completely.
Add 5 µl (small) or 7 µl (big) Midori-Green DNA Stain to the heated TAE-Agarose mix and pour into respective gel-chamber with desired comb.
Let it cool for >45 minutes until it has complete solidificated.
Remove comb carefully to reveal the gel slots.
Pour 1 x  TAE-Buffer over the cooled down gel until it is completely covered in liquid.
Gel run of test digests
Put 5µl (small gel) or 8 µl (big gel) DNA ladder (1kb GeneRuler plus) into slot for use as reference.
Mix DNA Sample with Loading Dye for desired Dilution (6x Purple or Orange Loading Dye)
Load Gel Slot with Dna Sample
Run the Gel with following settings: 120 Volt, 3 Watte, 15 Ampere for 45 Minutes.
Visualize in the Gelbox with Exposure Time of 64 seconds and UV-Light.
