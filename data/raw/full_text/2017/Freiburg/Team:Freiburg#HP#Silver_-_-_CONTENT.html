Synthetic biology is a controversial topic especially in Germany. Therefore, public outreach efforts are necessary to enhance the general understanding of synthetic biology and to facilitate acceptance. In return, the scientific community can profit from the bidirectional dialogue. During the summer we had several opportunities to engage in such dialogues. 
                </P><P>To raise awareness of the benefits of such exchange for scientists one of our team members gave a <B>lecture</B> to students of biology. It covered ethics in the context of iGEM and synthetic biology.

discussed.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="item"><P>In order to engage with the local community we participated in the <B>science fair Freiburg</B>.

A puzzle termed immunology for everybody (<I>Immunologie für Jedermann</I>) which was gratefully provided by the German Society for Immunologie (<I>Deutsche Gesellschaft für Immunologie e.V;. DGFI</I>) helped us to explain the different types of immune cell in the body. We talked to people about the importance of vaccinations and faced their questions and insecurities by explaining how the immune system actually works.

Our hypothesis was, that people tend to show a <B>spontaneous emotional reaction to GMF</B>, while in specific cases they are rather convincible by the potential of genetic modification in agriculture.

It contains less nutrients, e.g. vitamin A, compared to brown unpolished rice. Combined with poverty and under-supply this can lead to life-threatening malnourishment, one of the main causes for high childhood mortality in these countries. 
In 2000, rice containing beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, has been developed in Freiburg using genetic engineering. It is promoted for being a way to effectively decrease malnourishment in regions with rice as staple food. Still, it is seen only as one action among others to sustainably counteract under-supply in poor countries.</I></P><H4>Introduction to genetically modified food</H4><P><I>Genetically modified foods are defined as being produced by genetically modified organisms.
