SEAP
The SEAP assay was performed as mentioned before, however, there was a 1:5 dilution included of the HRE-SEAP samples.
For the analysis of the SEAP assay, the averages of the triplicates were calculated and the respective wild-type control subtracted from the HRE-SEAP samples.
For the undiluted HRE-SEAP construct the following graph was obtained:
For the 1:5 dilution the following graph was obtained:
For the 1:5 dilution absorbance values are missing at the start because they were negative and therefore regarded as 0.
The positive control did not work due to the promoter of this construct which was dependent on an input that wasn't given. Furthermore, the samples did not show what we expected, considering that the uninduced control showed a steeper slope than most of the samples. Due to this reason the experiment was repeated.

Lentiviral Transduction (pIG17_130)
Plate 200000 cells/well (HEK & Jurkat) into 6 well plate
Titer of virus: 0, 15 µl, 30 µl
As shown in the picture the transduction of HEK cells showed high efficiency. The cells were also mycoplasma-negative, so that the cells can be sorted at Bioss.
The efficiency of transduction was quite low. The positive signal showed above may come from dead cells. New transduction was done on 8/30 with higher virus titer (45µl and 60µl).
Lentiviral transduction of Jurkat cells with higher virus titer showed higher efficiency than previous try. These cells are sent for microplasma-test and for cell sorting.

The SEAP assay was performed as before, this time we included a cell count of each pooled triplicate.
For the analysis first the averages of the triplicates were calculated and then divided by the cell count. Afterwards, the corresponding wild-type control was subtracted from the samples and all negative values were set to 0.
We could see that only 20, 40 and 80 µM CoCl2 showed a steeper slope in our samples than the 0 µM control.

CFP test
Due to the problems with our GFP readout we performed a search in BLAST and found out that our eGFP was wrongly annotate and is a eCFP. We also could see that in the FACS. For this we tested our Jurkat knockdown 130 cells, that stably express CFP then. On the left these cells are measured in the CFP channel and on the right in the GFP channel. The depicted cells are gated for living and single cells:
There is a clear shift and our cells are really CFP positive and not GFP positive
