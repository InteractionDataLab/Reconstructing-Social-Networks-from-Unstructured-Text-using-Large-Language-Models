The AND gate is constructed of two promoters interconnected through a protein, (HIF1A), to integrate two inputs into one output. Two alternative AND Gates were designed as follows: high VEGF concentrations and hypoxic conditions or alternatively low pH and hypoxic conditions.</P><P>As a proof of concept we characterized all the promoters separately in mammalian cell lines.
We therefore generated stable cell lines, containing the promoters for the inputs driving a reporter protein. Single and  multiple enhancer elements for the inputs: <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Design">pH, VEGF and hypoxia</A> were designed and integrated in <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Cell_culture">Jurkat and HEK293T cells</A>. 
    We could show an induced activity of the <I>hypoxia response element</I> promoter and the <I>cAMP response element</I> promoter in Jurkat cells (<B>Fig. 1</B>). <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Cell_culture">Flow cytometry</A> of Jurkat <I><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results">4xHRE-pTal:eCFP</A></I> cells showed an increase of eCFP positive cells with rising concentration of CoCl<SUB>2</SUB> (<B>Fig. 1a</B>).

We generated stable Jurkat and HEK293T cell lines in which <I>HIF1A</I> was efficiently knocked down. In addition, we could show that transient expression of HA tagged HIF1A in knockdown cells behaves as the endogenous HIF1A, without being affected by the siRNA used to generate the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Results">knockdown</A> (<B>Fig. 2</B>).</P></DIV><DIV class="item"><DIV class="image_box middle"><DIV class="figure"><DIV class="figureinner"><DIV class="figurecaption"><P><STRONG>Figure 2: Transient introduction of artificial HIF1A in HIF1A shRNA1 knockdown HEK293T cell line. </STRONG>
                       Induction of the overexpressed HIF1A-HA can be observed in the last lane. Endogenous and artificial HIF1A were detected with HIF1A antibody; reintroduced HIF1A was detected via an HA-tag; GAPDH served as a loading control. Wild type (WT) and knockdown (HIF1A shRNA1) cells were transfected with <I>CMV:HIF1A-HA</I> one day prior to induction with CoCl<SUB>2</SUB> to simulate hypoxia. Cells were harvested 24 hours after induction. Immunoblot assay was performed using antibodies against HIF1A, HA-tag and GAPDH.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="item"><P>As an additional safety feature for the CARTEL<SUP>TM</SUP> T cells we generated stable Jurkat T cell lines with the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/HP/Results">kill switch</A> gene <I>thymidine kinase</I>. In the event of uncontrolled actions by the T cells, they can be eliminated by the administration of the drug ganciclovir. It is only affecting cells containing the kill switch, unmodified cells remain intact. To evaluate the efficiency of our kill switch we performed an apoptosis assay with ganciclovir (<B>Fig. 3, 4</B>). Both cell lines expressing HSV-TK show significantly reduced survival rates compared to wild type cells following treatment with ganciclovir. We were able to show that we can add an additional level of safety to our project design by introducing a functional kill switch. </P></DIV><DIV class="item"><DIV class="image_box middle"><DIV class="figure"><DIV class="figureinner"><DIV class="figurecaption"><P><B>Figure 3: Survival curve of Jurkat cells treated with ganciclovir.</B> Depicted is the survival rate in percent after application of ganciclovir.
