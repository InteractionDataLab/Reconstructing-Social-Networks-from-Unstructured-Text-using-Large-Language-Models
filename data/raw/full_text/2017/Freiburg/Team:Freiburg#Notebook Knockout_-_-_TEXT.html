SDM PCR BsmBI and BbsI into Cas9-GFP and lenti-Cas9-puro
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as previously to insert BsmBI and BbsI into Cas9-GFP. PCR fragments were excised from gel and purified using a clear-up kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Fragments were digested with BsmBI or BbsI and NotI or EcoRI and purified using a PCR clear-up kit.
Cas9-GFP and lenti-Cas9-puro were digested with NotI and EcoRI in FD 10x.

Site directed mutagenesis PCR
Strategy was changed because strategy with shorter fragments for each side combined with NotI and EcoRI did not work (produced blunt-ends). Now a whole plasmid amplification was performed to insert BsmBI and BbsI into Cas9-GFP (run on 0.9% agarose at 110 V for 35 min, picture no. IMG00550). Protocols as for oroginal blunt end ligation estrategy, expected band of 9.3 kb was at 10 kb with good efficiency, also a 3 kb band was observed and both were extracted.

SDS-PAGE
Protein concentration was determined using amido black stain. 10 µg protein for each sample were was loaded on gel (problem with CoCl2 treated sample: not able to load appropriate volume). Blotting occurred over night at 4 °C (20 mA, 12 h). Membrane was blocked with 5% milk powder in TBST for 2.5 h.

lenti-Cas9-puro all RNAs electroporation
All RNA coding lenti-Cas9-puro were electroporated into Jurkat using CAS9-GFP RNAscramble as transfection control.
Protocol from cell culture was used:
2×10^6 cells and 9 µg DNA were resuspended in 200 µl 3P buffer
put in cuvettes and electroporated
500 µl RPMI were added
plated on 12 well plate, filled to 2 ml with RPMI
Puromycin toxicity assay
HEK cells were transfected with lenti-Cas9-puro RNA5 old cloning and SGEN as transfection control using PEI (1x10cm dish at ~50% confluency). 1 ml serum, phenol red free DMEM and 10 µg DNA were vortexed. 30 µl PEI (1µg/ml) were added and vortexed carefully. After 15 min PEI/DNA was added evenly to dish.

remove medium from cells
add 800 µl serum-free medium to DNA/PEI mixture and add to the cells
incubate ~3 h at 37°C
addd 2 ml culture medium to cells
Change medium after 3-5 h
