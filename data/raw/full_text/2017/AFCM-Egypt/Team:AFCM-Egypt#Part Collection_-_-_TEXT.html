Parts
We submitted the basic parts constituting our gene fragments, then
we designed the composite parts constituting these synthesised fragments
and finally we assembled these composite parts into our two main circuits
designed in order to compare their function at regulating non-coding RNAs.

Composite Parts representing Synthesized
Fragments
These composite parts were synthesised as separate gene fragments then assembled to form BBa_K2217025 and BBa_K2217026 representing ceRNA and CRISPR circuits respectively.
