Human practice
In the context of our research project, we have gone beyond the bench; as we aimed to fulfill the questions of “ ethics, social justice, security, safety and intellectual property “. We saw that each and every individual in the society has the right to know what’s going on the scientific field , not only the scientific and medical personnel, has to see the beam of hope in finding a solution for their illness and suffering. And this can be never done without the ethics that we followed all through our projects and the safety and security measures we did our best to achieve for the safety and good of our team, community and the whole humanity.
