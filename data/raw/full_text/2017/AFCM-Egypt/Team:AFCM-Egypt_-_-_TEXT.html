Competing endogenous RNA network : Potential entrants to gene editing in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Abstract
 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide & ranked first among cancers in males and next to breast cancer among females in Egypt based upon results of National Cancer Registry Program of Egypt. "Grabbing the problem from the roots" is the best way to decently describe the use of CRISPR, a special gene editing technique that we will be using to modulate a certain  circRNA and adjust its gene expression, which is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. This in consequence modifies   miRNA expression thus amending the mRNA gene expression; which is the visible problem in our trials.   This will lead us to adopt a novel strategy for miRNA suppression by using circRNAs. This is    accomplished by utilizing a   synthetic circuit to give rise to a springboard in our battle against cancer.
