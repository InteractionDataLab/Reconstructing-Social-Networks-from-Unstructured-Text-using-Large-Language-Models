It was so fruitful. We enjoyed a lot, but the most funny part of our collaborations was the selfies we took every time by the end of our calls ^_^ </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom: 50px;padding:5px"><DIV class="col-md-12 text-center" style="float:none;margin:auto"><DIV class="col-md-12" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);"><DIV class="col-md-6 text-center"><P>First collaboration was with the Swedish team &quot;Lund &quot;. As each team explained their project to the other. And we helped Lund with the methods of characterization as by providing suggestions on how they'll characterize the part they use in their project.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom: 50px"><DIV class="col-md-12 text-center" style="float:none;margin:auto"><DIV class="col-md-12" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);"><DIV class="col-md-6 text-center"><P>The second team we collaborated with was the French team &quot; iGEM IONIS &quot;. It was a great team; as we know iGEM is not only about science, we had so much fun during our calls even while we were explaining our projects and the hard steps that faced us during our work and helping each other to find solutions for the problems. We also helped Franconia with their survey as our team members translated it into Arabic and also asked our colleagues at the college and other non-medical individuals from different educational institutions in Egypt to fill-in the translated survey for them. We're preparing to exchange online lectures as we will give a lecture via video conference to the students in their college speaking about our project and lab work in exchange with a lecture they give to our college students in the same way. They also sent us the name of an RNA modeling server which helped us modeling our protein parts.We really enjoyed our time with that team.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);"><DIV class="col-md-6 text-center"><P>Last but not least was the German team &quot;iGEM Franconia&quot;. The most innovative team we ever met. As usual we started our calls by explaining our projects. Then we discussed the modeling part as we offered them help with blinder program for protein modeling. We also helped them translating their card game that was originally made in German into Arabic. And we have to confess this card game was adorable</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom: 50px"><DIV class="col-md-12 text-center" style="float:none;margin:auto"><DIV class="col-md-12" style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);"><DIV class="col-md-6 text-center"><P>We have helped some other iGEM teams such as &quot;Cologne-Duesseldorf, Cardiff Wales, Amazonas_Brazil, BIT china, UNebraska-Lincoln, Greece&quot;   through filling in their surveys helping them get better results and exchange knowledge.</P><H4>&quot;Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.&quot;</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
