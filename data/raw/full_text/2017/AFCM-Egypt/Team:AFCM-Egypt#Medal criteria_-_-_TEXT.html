Medal Criteria
Bronze
✔Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Done!
✔Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page
Done!
✔Attributions: Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project.
Done! See our page  here.
✔Improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry.  here  and  here
 
Silver
✔ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part’s Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Done! See the entry of our working part and its characterization  BBa_K2217001 ,  BBa_K2217009  +  BBa_K2217027 ,
  BBa_K2217028 ,  BBa_K2217023 ,  BBa_K2217018 , 
BBa_K2217029 ,  BBa_K2217008 ,  BBa_K2217025  and  BBa_K2217026
✔Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.
Done! See our Collaborations page  here.
✔ Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches.
Done! See our Silver Human Practices page  here.
 
GOLD
 
✔ Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project. Done! See our Gold Human Practices page  here.
✔ Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part .Done! HERE
Old Parts  BBa_K1179069 ,  BBa_K1119006  and  BBa_K1179062
New Improved parts  BBa_K2217013 ,  BBa_K2217024  and  BBa_K2217027  respectively.
✔ Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results. Done!

✔ Convince the judges that your project works.
Through the Gel Electrophoresis, we successfully showed the bands at expected fragment size. Also, our practical work plan included cell viability and cell count; as well as, quantitative real time PCR for detection of circRNA-associated ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA), and flow cytometery to detect yellow fluorescent protein (depicting successfully transfected cells) and validate target protein expression (TRIM)  here.
