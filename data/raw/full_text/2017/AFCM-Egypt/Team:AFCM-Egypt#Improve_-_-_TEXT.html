BBa_K2217013: We tried to improve CAG promoter at  BBa_K1179069  by making it  RFC 10   CMV enhancer + chicken beta-actin promoter, the part was improved by sequence adjustment to gene block synthesis requirements The sequence GGC was repeated 6 consecutive times starting at base 538 and a homopolymer run of 16 G bases is present starting at base 413 was reduced less than 9.
BBa_K2217024: We improved this part  BBa_K1119006  by Fusing CMV enhancer to CMV promoter in one composite part to enhance its transcription activity  BBa_K2217024 . Part characterization and usage can be found at  Part Experience .
 BBa_K2217027: tried to improve laci function at  BBa_K1179062  regarding inhibition of non-coding RNAs by fusing laci the binding site of the miRNA mir-1825 to hsa_circ_0000064 in one composite part to help controlling circular RNA hsa_circ_0000064 transcription at BBa_K2217001 in response to miRNA-1825 binding to this sensor binding site. Part characterization and usage can be found at  BBa_K2217027_Experience .
 Laci registered at  (BBa_K2217012) , was fused to the miRNA binding site of the miRNA mir-1825 as determined computationally using circinteractome database, where we hypothesized its function as a sensor for miRNA binding.
