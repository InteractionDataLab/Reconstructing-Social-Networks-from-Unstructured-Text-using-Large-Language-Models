ADVISORS
Ge Gao
I am one of the NKU_China team's advisers and a leader of experiment group. I am responsible for the design and implementation of the entire experiment, as well as adjustments and modifications. Taking part in this competition has given me a better understanding of synthetic biology and will help me with my future scientific research. I will continue to explore in the field of synthetic biology, and strive to achieve new breakthroughs and contributions.
LEADERS
Jiaxing Yang
I am the student team leader and a member of the experiment division of iGEM 2017 team NKU_China. In this competition, I am responsible for the major experimental design and for experimental work. In addition, I am also responsible for coaching other work, including human practice and Interlab Study. Synthetic biology makes me enjoy the wonderful biology. There are more unknown areas waiting for us to explore. I look forward to the emergence of perfect, versatile and controlled biological machines.
Zixi Yin
Hi, I am Yin Zixi, a senior student from Nankai University, and my major is biology. I have always been taking biology as a way to explore the natural world. And, we have come so far. From last winter to this autumn, we are ready for the Giant Jamboree！
MEMBERS
Zhuochen Zhang
I'm Zhuochen Zhang, a member of the Mathematical Modeling team .As an undergraduate student of Chemical biology speciality at Nankai university,I'm interested in Synthetic biology and I can combine chemistry with biology to solve certain  problem thanks to my major. Also, abstrating the biological problem to math problem seems amazing to me. Thus,in the big family of NKU-China team , I chose to be a member of Mathematical Modeling team.To help forecast the final result of our project, I' m making an effort to establish a model of bacterial migration. I believe that with my effort, calculation will play an important role in our project.
Chenyue Guo
I am Chenyue Guo, a junior student majoring in life science as well as a member of NKU_China team. In this group, I am responsible for the construction of engineered Enterobacter sp. FY-07 which is able to controllably produce rhamnolipid and cellulose at a suitable time so as to improve the oil recovery factor. Besides, I also participate in the experiment of Interlab Study. It was because of curiosity and hope for synthetic biology that I participated in this competition. I'm glad to have a chance to talk with different team members around the world and learn more about synthetic biology.
Xudong Zhang
Hi, I am Xudong Zhang. As a junior student majoring in biology, I have been a crazy fun of biology for a long time. Of course, I won’t miss this great opportunity to get closer to biology. Although the daily work always tries to bother me, I have learned a lot from this experience anyway. Thanks for my team and thanks for the IGEM.
Yuhan Wu
I am Yunhan Wu, a member of team NKU_China. Being an iGEMer has opened to me a brand new world of life science‒to design a life purposely, to test the possibility. The process of parts construction was just like treasure hunting‒searching for possible solutions out of weird errors and abnormal results.
Qinge Liang
Hi, I’m Qinge LIANG from Nankai University. As a student majoring in Biological technology, I deeply love synthetic biology as well as graphic design and want to explore them through lifetime. That is why I join the iGEM team. Being a member of team NKU_China is one of the most essential chapters during my college life. It is exciting to fight for the challenging work with partners varying in different backgrounds. Also, meeting all of you in the Giant Jamboree is the happiest thing for me.
Peiyan Cai
Hello everyone. I am Peiyan Cai, a junior student majoring in biotechnology. In this team, I am in charge of the human practice part and I would be very happy if I can make a contribution to the project. In August，I took part in CCiC to share ideas with other teams. Besides this competition, I do the research about enteric microorganisms in daily life.
Yang Li
I am Yang Lig, a sophomore in Nankai University. As a member in NKU_China, I participate in experiment part and work with other members to complete the project. Thank iGEM for giving me this chance to challenge myself.
Mengyu Liu
I am Mengyu Liu, a senior undergraduate student in Boling class in Nankai University. I am interested in neuroscience and I have finished three projects about neurons and stem cells. Now I am studying in Caltech as a VURP student. In this competition, I worked in experiment division and got involved in experiment designing and some other staff.
Yixin Lin
My two years’ college curriculums in NanKai University have given me the knowledge and ambition about biology. For lab projects, I have joined in a program to analyze the effect of flavonoid in curing cancer. In lab classes, I started to learn about the basic skills which helped me to understand how the scientific results came out from the phenomenon, such as observing the apoptotic cells under fluorescence microscope. Also, I earned the opportunity to join in the microbiological lab, which prepared me for working in a team cooperating with other professionals and practiced more beyond the class. From these experiences, I noticed that biology is a subject filled with details. If you make a mistake in one step, it may cause a terrible result. Now, I have joined in the IGEM team to do experiments.
Ziyu Wang
I'm Ziyu Wang, a member of 2017 iGEM team "NKU_China". I entered NKU at 2015 and fortunately enrolled in Boling Program, which benefits me a lot. Besides, a year ago, I went to Prof. Cunjiang Song's lab to train my lab skills on microbiology, which helps me find my dream—— synthetic biology. In addition, I, with some of my friends, participated the “100 Project” at Prof. Zhangyong Hong's lab, which holds by our school to enrich our experiences. I'm more than glad to take part in this year's iGEM and as a member of wet-lab group, doing those experiments makes me feel so good. I hope that our group can do a fantastic job and get the gold medal.
Yushuang Wu
I'm Yushuang Wu, a junior student in life science college  of NKU.  I am very honored to work as a member of the experiment team,  mainly do experiments like PCR, nucleic acid electrophoresis, gel extraction and so on. During the course of the experiment, I analyzed experimental results and inquired the optimum experiment conditions together with other teammates.
Wanru Zhang
This is Wanru Zhang, a girl comes from Changchun, the capital of Jinlin province, China. And nowadays, I am going to be a junior student majoring in life science in Nankai University. I am very interested in biology science so that I had started to get in touch with the experiment thing since I was in high school. Absolutely, in the team of igem, my work is relevant to the experiment part——making the design to come into a real thing. About my personal experience, I have been in the student union, the 21th century youth union and the media center of the college in the first two years of my college life. And I was the national scholarship recipient in 2016. Besides, I am an outgoing girl. And I really enjoy travelling and photography. I really want to make friends with you guys.
Zizheng Zhang
I am Zizheng Zhang, a junior of Nankai university. From the very beginning, painting and drawing are my hobbits. As I know more about the nature we human live in, life science becomes my favorite subject. Synthesizing a being that has never existed is one of the ultimate aims in biology and also the essential project of iGEM. Hence, I become an iGEMer and participate in art designing to contribution to our team and dedicate a little effort I can make to synthetic biology.
Zikun Zhu
I’m Zikun Zhu, a senior undergraduate student in Boling Class of Nankai university. In my daily life, I like sports such as swimming and soccer. Besides, doing experiments really interests me and occupies most of my free time. As a consequence, I joined our NKU team to participate in iGEM without hesitation. My work in our team is mainly about molecular cloning and seeking for collaborations. Hope we can get a good result!
