Background
In order to repeat measurements in different labs, iGEM has proposed Interlab studies. The aim is to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole. This is an optional and voluntary exercise for all teams. This is also an optional activity for one the Bronze Medal Requirements this year. This year’s gaol was to measure the GFP fluorescence in a plate reader to test some RBS devices (BCDs) that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable.
Overview
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to all engineering disciplines.  So one of the big challenges in synthetic biology measurement is that fluorescence data usually cannot be compared because it is reported in different units or because different groups process data in different ways.  Often working around this by doing some sort of “relative expression” comparison; however, being unable to directly compare measurements makes it harder to debug engineered biological constructs, harder to effectively share constructs between labs, and harder even to just interpret your experimental controls.
Thanks to iGEM’s  interLab protocol for measuring GFP fluorescence, we have a chance to participate in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. Our team also participated in the measurement study last year. Through learning from them, we have confident in doing this better this year. With minor difficulties we managed to complete the experiments and submit our results.
Devices
The 2017 iGEM teams were provided with six test devices, including two controls, a positive and negative control
Kit Plate 7 InterLab Part Locations
Positive Control (BBa_I20270)
Negative Control (BBa_R0040)
Test Device 1 (BBa_J364000)
Test Device 2 (BBa_J364001)
Test Device 3 (BBa_J364002)
Test Device 4 (BBa_J364003)
Test Device 5 (BBa_J364004)
Test Device 6 (BBa_J364005)
Each of the test devices consisted of promotors J23101, J23106, J23117, J23101, J23106, J23117 respectively. The rest of the test devices was identical consisting of the RBS, the terminator and the GFP (E0040).
Each device is in the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone, so transform all of the devices onto plates containing chloramphenicol.

96 well plate, black with flat bottom preferred (provided by team))
◻◻ Prepare the fluorescein stock solution
◻◻Prepare the serial dilutions of fluorescein
1. Spin down FITC stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube.
2. Prepare 2x FITC stock solution (500 μM) by resuspending FITC in 1 mL of 1xPBS
