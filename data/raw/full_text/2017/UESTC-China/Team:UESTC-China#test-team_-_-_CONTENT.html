We have been mentoring a new team, TMMU-China team, which we are the first one introducing iGEM to TMMU. We helped Jilin-China construct a part that optimizing expression and helped UESTC-China-software complete part of the validation experiments. Besides, we got in touch with the W&amp;M team 2015 to get the “curriculum booklet” and had a lesson with 15 families, then communicated the improvements with W&amp;M team. Finally, in the course of our human practices of popularizing iGEM , a high school, Chengdu NO.7 High School, is interested in it. With our help, it’s likely that they will establish an iGEM team next year.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="c_2"><DIV class="T-member"><P>Hi, I am Binglin Liu, the team leader of UESTC-China, and an outgoing lad who always amuses my teammates to relieve their pressure. It is a fantastic journey for me to join iGEM as although we constantly face many difficulties under pressure and challenge, our persistence can always help us overcome any trouble.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>The person who makes the experiment not only need rigorous attitude also need humorous character. Make a funny person in order to stick to the boring work. So, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>For me, majoring in biology is an amazing journey as well as fulfilled life. Participating in iGEM is a fantastic experience more than a changeable competition. It is a window connecting to brilliant knowledge and pleasurable as well as suffering life. For others, It is a play – interesting, funny, painful, powerful and unforgettable. iGEM is for life, for future. So the most romantic and exciting thing is… what?　しらない。  </P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>Living in the 21th, I have seen the magic and great of biotechnology, which changed the life of the whole humans. And with the development of biology, we have accumulated lots of information for large data analysis and let synthetic biology becomes the truth. So I choose to learn biotechnology in UESTC. In my school, the thought of synthetic biology is very popular and it encourages students attend to lab. When I was a freshman, I had heard about iGEM and the idea of it attracts me much. Becoming a iGEMer is my lucky and the day fight for iGEM is worth commemorating.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>I join iGEM in order to find more friends who have the same interests, not only in biology. I prefer to make friends, talk about our future, begin our brain storm. In my words, everything have their common point. When we join this competition, what we learn more than biology. I also like play basketball, although I get badly injured, l still love it deeply. 	
					Boston, I love Celtics, I am a big fan, I want them win the champion!!! Let’s go Celtics! Unbutu!
					</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>Self reflection:
					For me, iGEM is a key to a new world which leads me to open the door of synthetic biology. As an iGEMer, I’m lucky to be involved in creating a magic. What’s more, I have the honor to witness many legends in biology linking we humans with the nature. 
					In my campus life, it is the iGEM that gives me a chance to learn many impossibilities in this world. I believe I can enjoy in this year’s competition and I’m looking forward to making friends with other like-minded people.
					</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>For me, participating in iGEM is an amazing journey during my school life. It’s not only a competition, but also a challenge for myself. As a university student, it’s important to apply our professional knowledge into real life. Now we are trying to solve the environment problem through ourselves. It’s really unbelievable! At the same time, to work with a group of friends is very wonderful. It’s iGEM that makes my campus more colorful.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>Participating in iGEM is a fantastic experience more than a challenging competition. As one iGEMer, I am always wondering what else could we do to improve our project. I read some related papers and more important, use it in our own. IGEM is attractive to me because I can design the experiment on my own and solve problems during the process. By the way, the story of my life in iGEM: it’s a beautiful day outside, I still have a lot of work to do.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>It’s my honor to be one of the iGEMers. In our team, we can not only know more about synthetic biology, but also get more happiness. In our team, we study together, we work together, we play together. In our team, we can learn a lot. 
					For me, majoring in biology is an amazing journey more than an unexpected coincidence, doing experiments is not a dull thing, but a process of discovery. Thanks for give me the chance to learn more about synthetic biology. The iGEM makes my campus more interesting.
					</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>Oh,en,I’m an iGEMer.To be honest,I take about 2 years to make it.Majoring in biology is an amazing journey.I still can remember that I told my parents I want to a person studying biology.haha.Participating in iGEM is an indelible experience.Not only the result of the competition,but the process of preparing.It’s not a easy way.I once thought that if the work i did was significative in the hardest time.Just hold on,an iGEMer never give up.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>We should read more paper, find the data we want, do job beyond yourself ,ignore what you will get ,be iGEMers ,be ourselves!
					Do faint things meaningful out of people’s sight,
					and show excellent job to world in the end. It’s the attitude we should hold, just fighting for it, fighting for you think, you want, just fighting for you future. Let’s do it!
					</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>As one iGEMer, I enjoy every single day in my lab and Life Science what owns deep philosophy inside. Synthetic biology can transform our fancy into actual perfect application. Our research could make contribution to society and improve our environmental quality. Besides this, I believe that a man who desire to be more than a normal student in his 20s, who working hard, studying day and night. For myself, I have so many hobbies like photographing, movies and so on. </P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>Someone has said ,a life hit the biggest lucky, in his way of life midway, namely in the prime of life in he found his mission.

I come from Sichuan Province. My major is Software Engineering. I’m fond of coding and thinking and enjoying them all the time. I like exploring the principle which people are accustomed to. In addition, I’m glad to become a iGEMer. I think this summer will be the most meaningful summer during my campus life. Meanwhile, I’m pleased with making a lot new friends and get in touch with synthetic biology. Finally, as Tagore says: let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.</P></DIV><DIV class="T-member"><P>For me, iGEM means a responsibility ,  a belief, a memory. Participating in him is not only a competition, but also a process of working together under a team.In this experience, I feel the deep friendship between my teammates.
