We know that we cannot solve the problems well which related to human development only by research. With the help of experts’ power, we can make it more professional and more in-depth. Therefore, we have built a ‘Global League of Professors’ to guide our projects. So we contacted with experts from several countries and universities all over the world about plants or environment by emails, videos and face to face interview, More importantly, our project has been widely concerned in the academic community with the help of their contacts and resources.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/HP/Gold_Integrated">Click here for more details about our human practice.</A></P><P class="sub-title"><SPAN>☑</SPAN> Improve a previous part or project</P><P>We have constructed two <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2286006">BBa_K2286006</A>  and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2286008">BBa_K2286008</A>  parts as the improvement of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1199044">BBa_K1199044</A>.

To achieve our iGEM ecosphere, we went to several schools first. We exchanged little handmade plant printing bags with pupils, made micro landscapes of domestic waste with middle school students, and held a brainstorming about synthetic biology in middle school. We guided young people to understand synthetic biology, so that they would become the industry's reserve talent. Meanwhile, we organized an exhibition with Southwest Union and mobilized college students to help us dig up soil samples. Even more, we helped SiCAU build their team. Under our influence, more and more students have joined iGEM. We communicated with many professionals who are in our ecosphere. They referred to a common problem, laboratory safety, which lacks a uniform safety standard in basic biology labs in China. So we made China's first iGEM laboratory safety video and comics. We hope the ecosphere can develop with a medium. Even if the competition is over, it will continue to output influence, and continue to promote synthetic biology. So we designed an easy-to-understand turn-based board game based on synthetic biology, Gene Card. It becomes popular in China during a short time and turn it into a lot of people's biological enlightenment game teaching aid.</P><P class="sub-title"><SPAN>☑</SPAN> Best Integrated Human Practices</P><P>More than engagement, we integrated supporting research in our human practice.

The efficiency of multi-enzyme processes can be enhanced by optimization of the stoichiometry of the biocatalysts. Dynamics research has been a hot topic，however the dynamics of the multi-enzyme system is complex. We built a mathematical model, and the enzyme stoichiometry of each pathway was optimized. Mathematical modeling and one-pot multienzyme experiments provided detailed insights into pathway dynamics, enabled the selection of a suitable engineered enzyme, and optimal ratios of enzymes. According to the modeling results, and combining the character of plants, we constructed different plasmids. Then some parameters were adjusted for the best fitting with our experimental data. The validated model was used to quantitatively describe the kinetic limitations of currently available enzyme variants and predict improvements required for further pathway optimization. We used the model to guide the design, and found an optimal strategy to improve project conversion efficiency.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Model">Click here for modeling.</A></P><P class="sub-title"><SPAN>☑</SPAN> Best Plant Synthetic Biology</P><P>Our team produced a Super Tobacco which could degrade 1,2,3-TCP into glycerol this year. We introduced three key enzymes, DhaA31, HheC-W249P, EchA into tobacco by Agrobacterium mediated transformation with the application of synthetic biology of plants. In order to obtain better degradation efficiency of TCP by enriching these three enzymes at the root of tobacco, we also used a plant root specific expression promoter YK10 to replace the constitutive promoter CaMV35s. At the same time, a gene encoding the expression of cytokinin, CKX3, which could improve the biomass of roots as well as a plant cell wall localization signal peptide AO-S were also introduced into tobacco. All the genes we used have been codon-optimized for dicotyledonous plants and were submitted as BioBricks to iGEM Registry. Our results provided a potential approach for degrading 1,2,3-TCP by plants and we hoped that our Biobricks could be helpful to other iGEMers who worked with synthetic biology of plants in the future!<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UESTC-China/Plant">Click here for plant.</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
