Enzyme Assay
1. Plant Genomic DNA Extraction
Reaction proceeded in 200 mM Tris-SO4 buffer (pH 8.5) at 37°C. 1,2,3-TCP, 2,3-DCP, ECH , CPD, GDL were quantified by a gas chromatograph Fuli GC System 9750 equipped with a capillary column ZB-FFAP 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm (Phenomenex, USA). Glycerol was quantified by a gas chromatograph Fuli GC System 9790Ⅱ equipped with DB-5 column (L60 m×i.d. 0.25 mm and df 0.25 m thin coating film) (Supelco, Bellefonate, PA, USA).
Detection of 1,2,3-TCP, 2,3-DCP, ECH, CPD, GDL
Sample preparation:
Samples (0.25 mL) were collected from the reaction mixture, extracted with 0.5 mL of ethyl acetate and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate(12000×g, 90s).
Gas chromatography analysis:
Aliquots (2 μL) were injected into the GC with an injector temperature of 220°C. The operating column temperature was 100°C. The temperature of the detector was 280°C.
The concentration of the products were determined by GC under the following conditions: 100 °C for 7min, 15 °C/min to 220°C, and 15 min at 220 °C.
Detection of glycerol
Sample preparation:
One hundred microliters of the fluid sample and 50 μL of 1,2,3-butanetriol internal standard (100 μg/mL) were mixed and lyophilized. Then, the dried sample was homogeneously mixed with 200 μL of TMSIM and 50 μL of acetonitrile through ultrasonication. The mixture was placed in a 60 ◦C water bath for 45 min to perform the pre-column derivatization. The reaction solvent was then evaporated using a vacuum evaporator. The dried residue was dissolved in 100 μL of hexane.
Gas chromatography analysis:
The GC(Fuli 9790Ⅱ) was equipped with a DB-5 column (L60 m×i.d. 0.25 mm and df 0.25 m thin coating film) (Supelco, Bellefonate, PA, USA). Nitrogen was the carrier gas. The injection port temperature was set at 280 ◦C. The oven temperature was programmed from 100 to 250 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C/min and was held at the final temperature for 15 min. The glycerol concentration was calculated using a calibration curve of the peak area ratios of different quantities of glycerol standard to the consistent quantity of the added internal standard.
2. Protein expression
The recombinant strain E. coli MC1061, carrying either pBADDhaA31, pBADEchA, pBADHheC-WT or pBADHheC-mutant gene, was incubated overnight at 30 °C in 500 ml LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.05% (w/v) L-arabinose to reach an OD600 of 1.7 to 2.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000×g, 15 min) at 4 °C and washed once with 50 mM Tris-SO4 buffer (pH 8.0), then centrifuge(8000×g, 10min). The concentrations of proteins were measured using Bradford’s method.
3. Enzyme activity assay
Reaction proceeded in 5 ml 50 mM Tris-SO4 buffer (pH = 8.0) at 37°C, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of a certain amount of enzyme. Samples (0.25 ml each) were taken periodically from the reaction mixture and immediately added into 0.9 ml reagent I [30 mM NH4Fe(SO4)2 in 1 M HNO3] to stop the reaction, after which 0.1 ml reagent II [saturated solution of Hg(SCN)2 in absolute ethanol] was added. The absorbance of the mixture at 460 nm was measured on a UV spectrometer.
