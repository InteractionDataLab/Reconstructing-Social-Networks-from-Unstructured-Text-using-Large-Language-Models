To know common pesticide contamination and public biosecurity awareness, we sent three kinds of customized questionnaires to different people. The questionnaires made us know the TCP，which is harmful. Subsequently, we learned about the presence of a large number of TCP by detecting soil from soil survey. We know that we cannot solve the problems well which related to human development only by research. With the help of experts’ power, we can make it more professional and more in-depth. Therefore, we have built a ‘Global League of Professors’ to guide our projects. So we contacted with experts from several countries and universities all over the world about plants or environment by emails, videos and face to face interview, More importantly, our project has been widely concerned in the academic community with the help of their contacts and resources. </P></DIV><DIV id="Diversity-survey"><H2>Diversity survey</H2><P class="sub-title">☁ Questionnaire for industrial and agricultural producers</P><P>We interviewed the main potential producers of pollution sources: factories and farmland, and sent them some questionnaires to try to understand whether there could be TCP residues in plant waste and pesticides. After the investigation, we talked to them, listened to their views on soil pollution, and taught farmers some basic ways to prevent excessive use of land and prevent pollution.</P><P class="mid">Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that peasants use the most pesticides as insecticide.</P><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#one">Click here to see more !</BUTTON><P class="sub-title">☁ Questionnaire for local residents</P><P>Ordinary local residents are the most vulnerable population to soil pollution. Their living conditions and their attitudes are a matter of great concern to us. Before we identified the project theme, we investigated the environmental concerns of the public and collected their opinions towards synthetic biology. Combined with the work that iGEM had done a few years ago, we found that soil contamination was a widespread problem that had not yet be well addressed.</P><P class="mid">Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that there is no correct understanding of biosafety.</P><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#two">Click here to see more !</BUTTON><P class="sub-title">☁ Questionnaires distributed all over China</P><P>Hundreds of volunteers distributed a total of 500 questionnaires throughout the country, and we analyzed those questionnaires from different areas and accumulated most valuable information and statistics.</P><P class="mid">Analysis: We found from this questionnaire that half of the people agreed with the plants to solve the soil.</P><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#three">Click here to see more !</BUTTON></DIV><DIV id="experts"><H2>Connection with experts</H2><P>Soil pollution is a widespread problem. To solve the problem, we can not only rely on ourselves unilaterally, so we need to get elites from each aspect of society involved. Therefore, we interviewed experts around the world in the field of biotechnology and environment, hoping that they can bring us some useful advice. And we leave our footprints throughout the world map to build a comprehensive and holistic view. </P><P class="sub-title">☁ New York University, Professor Christine A.
