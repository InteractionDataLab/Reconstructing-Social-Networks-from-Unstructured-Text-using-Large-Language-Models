In our experiments, we hope that according to the related research of enzyme kinetic engineering, building a suitable mathematical model to characterize TCP and glycerol the time-varying theoretical curve evaluates our actual measured values and finds the interaction of the three foreign genes at the expression level.

Three parameter settings for the model are listed in Table 1. The first setting was based on kinetic parameters of the three enzymes under the same experimental reaction conditions. But there were some differences in terms of reaction time required for reaching the equilibrium. Kinetic parameters of an individual enzyme may not be the same as its apparent catalytic activity in the mixture of multiple enzymes. The first set of parameters need be adjusted for the best fitting. Among a number of parameters tested, it was found out that adjusting one kinetic parameters. Simulation curves based on the secend set of data exhibited the best fitting (Fig. 1). </P><P class="mid">Fig.1 (A) Simulation modeling and experimental results of the synthesis of GLY from TCP.

At present, there are many studies related to DhA, and DhA31 is already available the highest activity of the mutant, so the value of

We define the k<SPAN class="subScript">cat</SPAN> when the reaction completion time is not greater than 110% of the minimum time to completion of the reaction for finding the optimal mutant.

Because each enzymatic reaction is reversible, the overall reaction could reach the equilibria when the reaction time is long enough. We defined the time when glycerinum concentration reached 90% of the equilibrium concentration for calculating the volumetric productivity. The simulation curve of GLY loading (Fig. 2A) indicates that the critical DhA31 loading is approximately 0.50 U/mL.</P><P>Below this concentration, decreasing DhA31 loading greatly decreases the volumetric productivity; beyond this concentration, increasing DhA31 loading only slightly promotes the productivity. Similarly, the critical loading of HheC and EchA were estimated to be 1.00 U/mL and 1.50 U/mL, respectively (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the optimal enzyme loading ratio of Dha31:HheC:EchA is 0.5:1.0:1.5. Experiment at this enzyme ratio was conducted to validate the model prediction. As shown in Fig. 2B, the simulation curves of TCP, intermediates and the glycerinum fit well with experimental data, indicating the validity of the model. At this enzyme ratio, reaction time to reach 90% of the glycerinum equilibrium was decreased from 30 to 15 h.</P><P class="mid">Fig. 2 (A) Predictive simulation for the effects of enzyme loading on the synthesis of glycerinum in ….，(B) Smulation modeling of the synthesis of glycerinum in …..，</P></DIV><DIV id="Summary"><H2>Summary</H2><P>We developed the mathematical model of the three-chain reaction by the kinetic study of the enzyme. We predict the changes in the concentration of substrate TCP, each intermediate product, and glycerol over time. Then we get the catalytic constant of the enzyme through a lot of experiments. We use these constant to predict the ideal concentration curve, and compared with the experimental data, we found that we can get a high degree of fitting. We decided to improve the HheC's catalytic constant of the enzyme by analyzing and testing the final decision. We found that the greater the k value, the smaller the effect on the glycerol production curve. We predicted the correlation curves of various mutants, and finally chose the HheC-W249P mutant to construct the vector. Then we predict the optimal enzyme ratio of 1: 2: 4, so although EchA is expressed in the plant, we still construct the gene, hoping to let the plant overexpress the enzyme to a certain extent, Compared to the rate at which TCP degrades to glycerol.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
