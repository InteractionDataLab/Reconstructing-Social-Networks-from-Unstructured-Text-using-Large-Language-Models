We think that the best way to teach is to play with edutainment, so we want students to learn knowledge while playing knowledge is a more efficient way.</P><P class="subHead"><B> Extension： </B></P><P>In the CCIC, we introduced Gene Card to all China iGEM team, and gave some teams a Chinese version of Gene Card for the memorial, hope they give us some feedback. Which is worth mentioning, CCIC invited guest, Zhang Haoqian , the CTO OF Beijing Bluepha Microbial Technology Company, praised our card game on twitter.</P><P>We entered the major middle schools in Chengdu and introduced our cards to them and organized some card games. The students gave us feedback and showed a strong interest in playing cards.</P><P>In the UESTC school 61st anniversary, Innovative Entrepreneurship Week ,we made the cards as part of our show, introduced to all UESTC students and leaders, many students have great interest in playing it, and asked the price because they would like to buy a set of cards, we gave them for free.</P><P class="subHead"><B> Future planning:</B></P><P>We want to promote Gene card, so that school students can learn more knowledge through the form of entertainment, Our primary intention is to cooperate with the national primary and secondary schools, made Gene Card as biological learning aids into the campus, let the traditional biology class more lively and interesting, and more extensive publicity of synthetic biology.</P><P>Chick here to see our card!</P></DIV><DIV id="Interact-with-Students"><DIV class="title"><H1>Interact with Students</H1></DIV><P>In China, students only learn biology since high school. We hope to reduce this standard, let the junior middle school students even primary school students to participate in the activities of biology learning, and the environmental protection theme is blended in among them, let the junior students experience the fun of life in the activity.</P><P class="subHead"><B> Primary school: </B></P><P>UESTC-China hosted a lab Open Day event called &quot;A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH SCIENCE&quot; which attracted 20+ students and 10+ parents.</P><P class="subHead"><B> Junior middle school：</B></P><P>We are in Sichuan province Puyang middle school held a theme of &quot;synthetic biology and environmental protection&quot;, a total of more than 300 students and more than a dozen teachers involved, we caught that some of students in the activities of synthetic biology has bright idea.</P><P class="subHead"><B> High school：</B></P><P>We have invited more than 10 junior high school students affiliated to the University of Electronic Science and Technology in UESTC campus participated in an interesting environmental activities, the students played a whimsy, hands of the carton, takeaway plastic meal Box has been transformed, made an incredible microlandscape. We also invited them to experience the Gene Card, and they also made some suggestions for our tour.</P></DIV><DIV id="Library-Exhibition"><DIV class="title"><H1>Library Exhibition</H1></DIV><P>In China, many people of synthetic biology (GM) has a very one-sided understanding and prejudice, their understanding is still limited to the potential risk of genetically modified food, but did not see the benefits of synthetic biology. So the four teams together, held the &quot;synthetic biology and human&quot; is the theme of the exhibition at the Chengdu city library, answered the questions from the citizens of GM, changed their view for it. But for a small number of people, they still believe that we are preaching a dangerous, non proven field, Changing their one-sided ideas is what our propaganda means.</P></DIV><DIV id="Safety-Tips"><DIV class="title"><H1>Interesting Safety Tips</H1></DIV><P>Laboratory safety specification is we focus on the problem, now many laboratories have ignored the importance of laboratory safety, it will cause damage to laboratory personnel safety, so China iGEMer together, ready to shoot a series of laboratory safety education video, UESTC - China is responsible for the laboratory use and processing part of the tool. </P><P>More vivid and more attractive safety propaganda form is our goal, UESTC - China's men drew a series of comics, to use in various exhibitions and publicity, but also they uploaded to Wechat platform, won many people's thumb up</P><P class="subHead"><B> Show our project</B></P><P>Frequently, UESTC-China players often receive a popular question: what do you do? Explained to some of my friends several times, we found that a single language doesn't make them work and can’t show the significance of our understanding very clear, so we decided to shoot a group of US propaganda of the video, and they uploaded to our personal homepage, like comics, also gain a lot of praise.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
