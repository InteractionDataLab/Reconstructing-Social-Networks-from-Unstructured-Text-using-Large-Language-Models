In China, when people think of synthetic biology, the potential risk of genetically modified food rather than the benefits of synthetic biology comes to their minds. . It’s hard to change this kind of stereotype or prejudice. So there are four teams which held the activity named "Synthetic Biology and Human" at the Chengdu city library. They answered the questions concerning transgenosis from citizens, and intended to change people’s views. However, a small number of people still believe that we are preaching a dangerous, unproved technology. Changing their one-sided ideas is what we strive to accomplish.
CCiC
This year we have also participated in the CCIC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee), and communicated with other iGEM teams from all over China.
Demonstrate our project
More often than not, UESTC-China iGEMers are asked a question: what do you do? After explained to some of our friends several times, we found that one single sentence can’t clearly show the significance of our project. So we recorded a music video called Believer, to better elaborate on our projects and teams. Our MV has gotten more than 1000 hits on video websites.

Videos about lab safety
We are concerned about the daily safety of laboratories which are consistently ignored by many. China iGEMers from 11 universities posted a series of lab safety education videos and received millions of view on major video sites. UESTC - China abides by the laboratory safety codes in a strict manner.
