Team Leader
Binglin Liu is the team leader. As a team leader, he was responsible for the coordination of the team, and supervised experimental details to promote the experimental process. The role he played in the experiment was mainly to finish the design, construction and verification of vectors. At the meantime, he contacted with bio companies to buy related reagents.
Plasmids Construction
Licong He , Jianzhe Yang and Demin Xu were mainly responsible for plasmids construction. They constructed all the plasmids needed for the project, which were transformated into tobacco by agrobacterium. They also constructed biological bricks. In addition, Licong He completed the construction of the mutants and biological bricks of the mutants.
Plant Tissue Culture
Ang Chen and Wei Liu were mainly responsible for plant tissue culture and agrobacterium-mediated tobacco transformation. They tried hard to make the plant in good condition and kept the providing of the plant material. After vector construction, they begun to transform these vectors to the plants and screened out positive plants. They also made the hydroponics to get data for detecting the conversion of TCP to GLY in vivo. By the way, the cooperation with Zhejiang University was done by them.
Positive Detection
Mengyao Li was mainly responsible for positive detection including extracting the genomic DNA or RNA of NT, and reversing transcription. Also she did partial enzyme assay to support data for modeling.
Enzyme Assay
Tingting Dong, Yuhong Wang and Demin Xu were mainly responsible for enzyme assay. They detected the multi-enzyme conversion of TCP in transgenic tobacco by gas chromatograph, and used the leaves of transgenic tobacco to detect enzymes activity in vitro. The method of hydroponics was also used to detect the conversion of TCP to GLY in vivo.
Human Practices
Jianzhe Yang, Qing Li, Yuhao Wang and Xilin Suo were mainly responsible for human practices.
They had made the following contributions ：
Support project： They carried out a variety of questionnaires and soil surveys for different groups of people throughout the country to pave the way for our project.
Engagement： They had a bunch of interesting synthetic biology activities, including creating a game to attract the students’ interests of biological.  They wanted citizens to popularize common sense of synthetic biology to eliminate some misunderstandings, and combined many universities to solve the problems that was hardly solved by themselves and guided some schools to join the ranks of iGEM, so that the iGEM team was huger.
Modeling
Lei Li was mainly responsible for modeling. According to the related research of enzyme kinetic engineering, he built a suitable mathematical model. Combined with a large number of experiments by the various catalytic constant of the enzyme, he got a high degree of fitting model curve. Through the model, he analyzed the mutants with the best reaction rate, obtained the optimum enzyme ratio by the model analysis, and improved the design and the conversion efficiency of glycerol.
Art Design
Lei Li, Jiayi Yin and Licong He were mainly responsible for art design. As art designers, they focused on cooperation and contacted with Human Practice, WiKi and experiment. Their work included the posters and PPTs required for the Southwest Alliance meeting, as well as HP-related gene card design, the planning of the safety comic book, the production of the poster, the various aspects of the road map and the production of illustrations, the design of the page design and illustrations of WiKi, as well as the PPT and poster design required for the reply.
Wiki
Yupei Yang and Changhao Li were mainly responsible for the establishment of our WiKi page. During the whole project, they warmly cooperated with art designers and designed a set of WiKi style. They were in charge of coding and debugging. Meanwhile, they collected project content from other members and delivered it to the website and ensured complete display of Wiki.
Advisor
Qian Liao
She gave us some instructions to optimize the experimental conditions for enzyme assay. At the same time ,she gave us much theoretical guidance to gas chromatograph analysis and taught us how to use the gas chromatograph
Instructors
Yong Zhang
He was one of our instructors. He guided us to design the whole project and helped us to check construction strategy whether it’s feasible. Especially, he gave us very professional guidance on molecular cloning. He also helped us to comb the passway and analysed the result. What’s more, he gave some useful suggestions on wiki and presentation.
Lixia Tang
She was one of our instructors. She gave us some guidance on modeling. She also gave us a hand on experiment of protein expression and detection of enzyme activity. In addition, she helped us to make the data analysis. Moreover, she came up with a series of valuable advices about the design of wiki and ppt.
Xuelian Zheng
She was one of our instructors. She gave us a lot of suggestions in details during the process of design and experiments. She helped our team leader to coordinate the team works and had communication with each member friendly to appease our tension. She also raised some idea about the style of our wiki, poster, banner and so on.

Experiment equipment support
Thanks to SFRI (Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agriculture science) for giving us support on Microplate Reader.
Human practices support
Thanks to Professor Sui (Professor Senfang Sui, Tsinghua University) for providing some instructive thoughts to us: 1. Probably because our protein expression is too low, the protein can’t be polymerized to form tetraploid , and can’t be detected; 2.Page electrophoresis can be used to determine whether the product is a monomer or a four polymer.
Thanks to Researcher Sun (Researcher Sun xubo researcher, Shaanxi Institute of soil engineering) for Providing us with important background support.
Thanks to Professor Yin (Professor Yin Huabing , University of Glasgow) for solving the important problem in our project.
Thanks to Professor Rushlow (Professor Christine A. Rushlow , New York University ) for giving us some suggestions.
