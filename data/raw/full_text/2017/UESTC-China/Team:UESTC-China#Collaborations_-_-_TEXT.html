Overview
This summer,we collaborated with two 2017 iGEM teams.We have been mentoring a new team, SiCAU-China.We helped ZJU-China detect the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma on the process of Phytophthora infestaning tobacco. SiCAU-China helped us build a expression vector. ZJU-China assisted us with the detection of the TCP(trichlorophenol) remnant in soil. Besides, we did a favor of constructing iGEM teams for Chengdu NO.4 High School and Chengdu Huaxi High School (University of Electronic Science and Technology secondary school). With our help, it’s likely that they will establish their own iGEM team next year.

SiCAU-China (Sichuan Agricultural University)：
SiCAU-China participates in the competition for the first time this year, so our collaboration with them focus on their team construction. click here to see more details: https://2017.igem.org/Team:SiCAU-China/Collaborations#UESTC-China
We lacked wild type of enzyme as comparison to meet the bronze  standard. We chosed to mutate mutant enzymes to wild type again. So they helped  us build the expression vector using the method of overlap  pcr.

ZJU-China (Zhejiang University)：
In order to help ZJU-China( Zhejiang University) detect the inhibitory effect of Trichoderma on the process of Phytophthora making inroads into tobacco, we did a lot of work as follows:
Respectively inoculated Phytophthora and Trichoderma into tissue culture tobacco with differentiated root, stem and leaf.
Specific method of inoculation: dig a some amount of medium (about 0.5cmX0.5cm), then use about 6ml up water to rinse its mycelia and spores, finally take 1ml solution from it, then pour it into the tissue culture bottle which with tobacco.
Trichoderma, Phytophthora, Trichoderma and Phytophthora, the control (up water) four groups inoculated at the same time, each with three repetitions. After inoculation, these plants were placed at 25℃ in incubator. We took photos everyday from different but fixed angles at 10:00 and 22:00 to record their growth status and health condition. We feed back the state of the plants regularly. After 15 days, we can saw these plants changed obviously. On the 30th day, we took them out of the bottles, got their fresh weight, then put into the dryer 105℃ for 0.5h.80℃ for 10h to get their dry weight. click here to see more details: https://2017.igem.org/Team:ZJU-China/Collaborations#uestc
Since we focus on the treatment of environment pollution, they helped us detect the TCP(trichlorophenol) remnant in soil by HPLC. There graph of the result can help us prove our achievement in the project.

Chengdu NO.4 High School & Chengdu Huaxi High School
Chengdu NO.4 High School and Chengdu Huaxi High School are interested in iGEM, so we combined with our experience and gave them recommendation of laboratory construction, equipment procurement, operational guidance and so on. With our help, it’s likely that they will establish an iGEM team next year.
