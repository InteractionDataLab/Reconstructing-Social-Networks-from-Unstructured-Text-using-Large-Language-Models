Sunday 7/2
Dina, Najla and Maya discussed lab space, reagents and work time, as well as future meetings:
Main Lab Space: 2033
Days and Times: based on experiments and is specific to each group, need to inform Bernadette beforehand
Regents: all reagents needed for the next two weeks are available, need to know more about SRB.
iGEM group meetings will be held on Sundays: update logs during the weekend, present work on Sunday for the whole team
Monday 7/3
Dina:
Email Dr. Vincent with updates
Re-read protocols, and write them by hand into lab notebook for next day

Prepared LB-Agar Chloramphenicol plates
Protocol:
Work on presentation for tomorrow's team meeting

Sunday 7/9
DspB Lab:
Meeting with  Dr. Vincent: changed protocol for the preparation of competent cells  as Cheryl mentioned in her email, need to use ultra competent cells (from Dr. Ihab's lab) → will start next week
Biofilm Lab:
Meeting with Bernadette and Maya to discuss materials and applinces being used in the lab for Biofilm Production.
Meeting with Professor Vincent to discuss how to proceed with porject:
96 well plates.
Add samples of SRB directly onto the wells (no inoculation); see if media is required for biofilm formation.
Possible simulation using appratus in lab (Bioflux 2000; https://bioflux.fluxionbio.com/microbiology )
To do:
Write up protocol for biofilm production on plastic pipe.
SRB media recipe (just in case wemay need to use it)
Appratus set up
Monday 7/10

Skype meeting with Pittsburgh for collaboration
Thursday 7/13
Interlab:
Competent cells test: there was no growth on any of the plates except for tiny colonies on the 100 pb/µL plate. Another method to prepare competent DH5α cells should be utilized.
Meeting to discuss Wiki with Yasmin
Biofilm lab:
Plated flouresent DH5α were incoulated on LB Ampicilin/Arabinose broth on 50 ml kleftt flask; left over 2 days in shaker at 37°C.
Sunday 7/16
Biofilm lab:
Using spechtophotometer, OD of inoculated cultre was found to be ~ 375. 3 dilutions were made at 7.5X, 13X and  26X. Dilutions and culture were left to incubate overnight in the air shaker at 37°C.
Monday 7/17
DspB Lab:
Obtain cells from Dr. Ihab lab, alongside the protocol
Cells from competent cell test grew after ≈ 5 days
Biofilm Lab:
Dilutions and original culture in broth were checked under UV and no fluorescence was found. Plated GFP-DH5α cells  were found to be fluorescent. Cultures in broth were scrapped and new LB Ampicilin/Arabinose broth was planned to be made.
Tuesday 7/14
Biofilm Lab:
LB Ampicilin/Arabinose broth was made.
DspB Lab:
Prepared more Chl LB plates for transformations
Sunday 7/23
DspB Lab:
Transform DspB (BBa_K1659200 | Kit plate 7 | well 15C) into ultra competent cells
Biofilm Lab:
Inoculate GFP-DH5α cells in 50 ml LB Amp/Arab broth in 150 ml Kelft flask. Left in shaker at 37 overnight to culture.
Tuesday 7/25
DspB Lab:
Transformation of DspB (BBa_K1659200 | Kit plate 7 | well 15C) into ultra competent cells.
Result: three colonies observed on LB Chl plate, no red fluorescence.
Biofilm Lab:
Dilute by 10-fold GFP-DH5α culture and plate in 96 well plate. Left to incubate over 2 days.
Sunday 7/16
Biofilm lab:
Using spechtophotometer, OD of inoculated cultre was found to be ~ 375. 3 dilutions were made at 7.5X, 13X and  26X. Dilutions and culture were left to incubate overnight in the air shaker at 37°C.
Thursday 7/27
Biofilm Lab:
GFP-DH5α biofilm were shown on 96 well plate.
Sunday 7/30
DspB Lab:
Overnight culture of DspB plate (from fridge) into LB Chl media, picked two colonies and left overnight shaking at 37˚C.
Monday 7/31
DspB Lab:
Mini prep to extract DspB (BBa_K1659200 | Kit plate 7 | well 15C) plasmid DNA.
Agarose mini-gel run of DspB plasmid to check size: successful transformation as the size was ≈ 3Kb as expected for DspB plasmid
Tuesday 8/15
DspB Lab:
Plated the remaining ultra competent cells ≈ 20 µLon LB plate to make more ultra-competent cells
Plated 50 µL of Saad's prepared DH5 Alpha on LB plate to make more competent cells
Transformation of DspB-DspA (BBa_K1659211 | Kit plate 7 | well 15I ) into LB-Chl plate
Need to do this for gene expression: DspB-DspA contained in the pSB1C3 backbone, was extracted via Miniprep. The NcoI restriction site was introduced upstream of each of our gene sequences (except BBa_K1659501 and BBa_K1659601) via PCR to facilitate their insertion into the arabinose-inducible pBAD/HisB commercial expression vector, and the insert-containing expression vectors were subsequently cloned separately into the standard laboratory E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 as well as a chemotaxis knockout strain E. coli RP437 ∆FliC.
