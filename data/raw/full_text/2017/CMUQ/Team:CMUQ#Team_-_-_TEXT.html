Dr. Anette Vincent
Co-Advisor
Dr. Vincent obtained her BSc and PhD degrees in Biochemistry from the National University of Singapore and is currently an Assistant Teaching Professor and Program Director of the Biological Sciences program at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar. Being a true blue Singaporean, she enjoys eating and cooking. If there was time for sports, football and netball are the sports of choice. Her scientific research focuses on the isolation and characterization of bacteriophages as an alternative to biocides/ antibiotics to combat pathogenic bacteria in the environment. Her group isolates undiscovered bacteriophages from the environment (sand, soil, wastewater) and purify these viruses against host bacterial species related to disease causing or bioremediation associated species. Through the use of next-generation sequencing techniques and computational biology tools, her group aims to elucidate the microbiome and bacteriophages from the environment with hopes to combat pathogenic bacteria from the environment
Cheryl Telmer
Co-Advisor
Major: Biological Sciences
As a Research Biologist at Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh we are developing fluorescent  and bioluminescent sensors for live-cell imaging of protein localization and dynamics of cell structure and function. Collaborative research projects with Dr. Miskov-Zivanov and her lab at the University of Pittsburgh, as part of DARPA's Big Mechanism program,are directed towards the design of a system for automated reading of scientific literature and assembly of causal, explanatory models of the dynamics of signaling pathways in cancer.
