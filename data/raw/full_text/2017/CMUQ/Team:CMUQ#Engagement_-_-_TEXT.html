Outreach
Our project was presented to Qatar Academy 10th grade students. In the beginning of the presentation, we introduced iGEM and gave a brief description including the possibility of high school students participating in such a prestigious competition. Then, background information on genetic engineering was briefly given. We walked them through the analysis of our project step by step leading to the issue and then asking them about their thoughts on possible solutions. The students were actively engaged and proposed a lot of creative ideas that were then discussed among each other. Finally, we introduced our proposed solution for this issue.
