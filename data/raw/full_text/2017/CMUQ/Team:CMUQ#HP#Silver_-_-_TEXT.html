We have presented our project to a variety of expert audiences in Doha, including petroleum engineers, Environmental engineers. In addition, we also intend to present it to people from diverse academic backgrounds.
The following is a responses that we have received from an expert.
"The idea of using bacteria to act as bacterial concentrations detectors, while also targeting the harmful bacteria is incredible. However, if this project goes in the long run, then you must also expand it by considering other factors involved in Microbial Induced Corrosion.", Mr. Ahmed Ali Johar (Chief Projects and Procurement Officer at WOQOD)
We would like to Thank all the experts for their cooperations and we intend to present our Human Practices in detail in our presentation.
