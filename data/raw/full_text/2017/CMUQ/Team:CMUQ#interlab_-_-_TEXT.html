Once dissolved, dispense 500 µL aliquots into 1.5ml eppendorf tubes, THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-CHILLED ON ICE.
Put on dry ice for 1.5 min before placing them in the -80˚C freezer
D2: Competent Cell Test
Introduction
The kit includes three vials of purified plasmid DNA from BBa_J04450 (RFP construct) in plasmid backbone pSB1C3.  Each vial contains 50 µL of DNA at a different concentration: 100 pg/µL, 50 pg/µL, 10 pg/µL. Perform transformations with each of these to determine how efficient your competent cells are.
Protocols adapted from: Here
Materials
DH5α cells (2013 Genetics lab stock)
70% ethanol
Paper towels
Lab marker / Sharpie
1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
Container for ice + ice
Competent cell aliquot(s)
Competent Cell Test Kit
Agar plates with chloramphenicol
42°C Waterbath (or hot water source and thermometer)
37°C Incubators (oven and shaker)
SOC media
Sterile glass beads or sterile cell spreader
Pipettor + tips
Procedure
Estimated time: 30 minutes active, 1.5 hours incubation
Clean your working area by wiping down with 70% ethanol.
Thaw competent cells on ice. Label one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each transformation and then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.
Do triplicates (3 each) of each concentration if possible, so you can calculate an average colony yield.
Spin down the DNA tubes from the Competent Cell Test Kit/Transformation Efficiency Kit to collect all of the DNA into the bottom of each tube prior to use. A quick spin of 20-30 seconds at 8,000-10,000 rpm will be sufficient. Note: There should be 50 µL of DNA in each tube sent in the Kit.
Pipet 1 µL of DNA into each micro centrifuge tube.
Pipet 50 µL of competent cells into each tube. Flick the tube gently with your finger to mix.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.  Pre-heat waterbath now to 42°C. Otherwise, hot water and an accurate thermometer works, too!
Heat-shock the cells by placing into the waterbath for 45 seconds (no longer than 1 min). Be careful to keep the lids of the tubes above the water level, and keep the ice close by.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 950 µL of SOC media per tube, and incubate at 37°C for 1 hour shaking at 200-300rpm. (Added floating boats and taped to the rack in the shaker), Prepare the agar plates during this time: label them and prepare spreader
Spin down the tubes at 10,000 rpm for 30 sec
Discard supernatant
Resuspend in 100 µL SOC and vortex to mix
Pipet 50 µL from each tube onto the appropriate plate, and spread the mixture evenly across the plate. Incubate at 37°C overnight or approximately 16 hours. Position the plates with the agar side at the top, and the lid at the bottom.
Next Day
Count the number of colonies on a light field or a dark background, such as a lab bench. Use the following equation to calculate your competent cell efficiency. If you've done triplicates of each sample, use the average cell colony count in the calculation.
Efficiency (in cfu/µg) = [colonies on plate (cfu) / Amount of DNA plated (ng)] x 1000 (ng/µg)
*Note: The measurement "Amount of DNA plated" refers to how much DNA was plated onto each agar plate, not the total amount of DNA used per transformation. You can calculate this number using the following equation:
Amount of DNA plated (ng) = Volume DNA added (1 µL) x concentration of DNA (refer to vial, convert to ng/µL) x [volume plated (100 µL) / total reaction volume (1000 µL)]
Results
Competent cells should have an efficiency of 1.5x10^8 to 6x10^8 cfu/µg DNA, where "cfu" means "colony-forming unit" and is a measurement of cells.
Here are some sample results:
DNA concentration 10 pg/µL                  50 pg/µL                     100 pg/µL
# of colonies                 280 - 360                 500 - 1000+                      1000+

TRANFORMATION PROTOCOL USED:
Resuspend DNA in selected wells in the Distribution Kit with 10µl dH20. Pipet up and down several times, let sit for a few minutes. Resuspension will be red from cresol red dye.
Label 1.5ml tubes with part name or well location. Fill lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5ml tubes (one tube for each transformation, including your control) in a floating foam tube rack.
Thaw competent cells on ice: This may take 10-15min for a 260µl stock. Dispose of unused competent cells. Do not refreeze unused thawed cells, as it will drastically reduce transformation efficiency.
Pipet 1 µL of DNA into each micro centrifuge tube.
Pipette 50µl of competent cells into 1.5ml tube: 50µl in a 1.5ml tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5ml tube for your control.
Pipette 1µl of resuspended DNA into 1.5ml tube: Pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
Pipette 1µl of control DNA into 2ml tube: Pipette 1µl of 10pg/µl control into your control transformation. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice.
Close 1.5ml tubes, incubate on ice for 30min: Tubes may be gently agitated/flicked to mix solution, but return to ice immediately.
Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 45 sec: 1.5ml tubes should be in a floating foam tube rack. Place in water bath to ensure the bottoms of the tubes are submerged. Timing is critical.
Incubate on ice for 5min: Return transformation tubes to ice bucket.
Pipette 950µl SOC media to each transformation: SOC should be stored at 4°C, but can be warmed to room temperature before use. Check for contamination.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hours, shaking at 220rpm
Pipette 100µL of each transformation onto petri plates Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
Day 3 : Cell growth, sampling, and assay
Set your instrument to read OD600 (as OD calibration setting)
Measure OD600 of the overnight cultures
Record data in your notebook
Import data into Excel ( Dilution Calculation) Sheet_1 provided
Dilute the cultures to a target OD 600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel ( Dilution Calculation ) Sheet_1) in  12 m l LB medium + Chloramphenicol
in 50 mL falcon tube (amber, or covered with foil to block light).
Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Take 500 μL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation. (At each time point, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a total of 16 samples per time point)
Place samples on ice.
At the end of sampling point you need to measure your samples (OD and Fl measurement), see the below for details.
Record data in your notebook
Import data into Excel ( cell measurement tab ) Sheet_1 provided
Measurement:
It is important that you use the same instrument settings that you used when measuring the fluorescein standard curve.  This includes using the sample volume (100 ul) you used for the fluorescein measurement.
Samples should be laid out according to Fig. 2. Pipette 100 μl of each sample into each well. Replicate samples of colony #1 should be pipetted into wells in rows A, B, C and D. Replicate samples of colony #2 should be pipetted into wells in rows E, F, G and H. Set the instrument settings as those that gave the best results in your calibration curves (no measurements off scale). If necessary you can test more than one of the previously calibrated settings to get the best data (no measurements off scale).
Hint:
No measurement off scale means the data you get does not out of range of your calibration curve.
Layout for Abs600 and Fluorescence measurement:
At the end of the experiment, you should have four plates to read. Each plate should be set up as shown below. You will have one plate for each time point: 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours.
