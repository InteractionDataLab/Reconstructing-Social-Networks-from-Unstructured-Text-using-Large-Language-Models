Working With Our Neighbors
Overview
Army West Point
Our team had a video conference with team Cadets2Vets in late June. During the video conference we were able to discuss a few issues that the Army team was having with their project. Due to our teams past experience we were able to not only give advice, but we were also able to correct some of the minor issues they were having with their project. We were also able to give insight as to how to prepare for the jamboree and what they should expect.
Airforce
Our team also had a video conference with the Air force team in late June. We mainly discussed the interlab studies with this team. At this point in the summer our team was able to complete the majority of the interlab study, so we gave them a few suggestions. We were also able to answer a few questions regarding the project as a whole. As a team sponsored by a secure laboratory, it becomes difficult in some aspects for the team that are taken for granted by other non-military teams. For example, our team and the air force team was restricted in the ability to take pictures in the lab and even to bring our work with us at the end of the day. This was due to the level of security that was apparent at these military research facilities. As an iGEM veteran, our team was able to give them key advice on how to get around some of these restrictions.
NRL
We were fortunate enough to collaborate with the Naval Research lab to debunk a few misconceptions the civilian population might have about the use of synthetic biology in the military. We were able to contribute to a podcast that will be available on the NRL website sometime in November. In this podcast, we talk about the military and their use of synthetic biology, why as Midshipmen and Future officers in the Navy and Marine Corps it is important to be knowledgeable in these biological advancements.
