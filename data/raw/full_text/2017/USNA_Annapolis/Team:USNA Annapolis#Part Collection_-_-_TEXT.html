Project Overview
Editing the Human Microbiome: Preventing Aerosolized Peptide Proteins
In The Beginning...
This is where we can talk about how the beginnings of the project started, the crew that was involved, and all of that jazz. Include hyperlinks here when names are mentioned, that would be a cool little feature for our website. Also, we can include hyperlinks to part of our interlab if it has any kind of relation. Also, we can change the background photo here from the DNA strand thing to something a little different like a series of pipes or something.
This is just some extra space that happens to be around if we need to use it.
Applications
The protein within the plasmid backbone of bacteria natural to the human microbiome could be used as a therapeutic drug to protect people from possible toxicants in the environment by sensing their harmful effects within biofilms and host cells or as a therapeutic drug to enhance someone’s natural microbiome by beneficial ionic responses with biofilm formation. For example, it could be taken and used to coat the insides of the respiratory tract to detect changes and prevent unregulated ion channels. This in turn could prevent serious bodily harm with minimal disturbance of ion balance/ biofilms and  could enhance microbiome response overall.
Protective biofilms throughout your body
Bacteria communicate with each other and the host cells
Create a sensor for ions for cell to cell communications in a medically relevant way
Out on the battlefield and expect to be exposed
What’s the response from the respiratory tract
Cell-cell communication within biofilms and with the host using ions within the human body
Risks
Our modified organism could pose the risk of environmental release, if applied to the human body. We will need to engineer in a kill-switch mechanism, or another self-destruct mechanism to control unintended proliferation.
