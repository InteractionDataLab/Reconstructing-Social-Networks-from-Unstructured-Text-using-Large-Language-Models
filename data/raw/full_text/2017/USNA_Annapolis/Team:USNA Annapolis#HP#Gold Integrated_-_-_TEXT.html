Biology and the Military
CDR Yasuda and our team discussed the harsh facts in the field of synthetic biology as it relates to the military, in that, one could engineer a biological organism for nefarious purposes. While many advances in synthetic biology have been focused on the positives such as, improving upon pre-existing shortcomings occurring in nature, some minds may focus on the fact that bad people could use synthetic biology techniques for nefarious purposes. He agreed with us that there is a misconception among the civilian population on how the military actually uses these biological advances. It is important to note that the military is using synthetic biology to defend our sailors and marines from harmful substances and not the otherway around.
