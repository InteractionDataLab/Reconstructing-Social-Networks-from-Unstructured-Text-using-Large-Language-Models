Trish Zulueta
Trish is a second-year biochemistry major interested in studying epigenetics and synthetic biology. She enjoys making music, working with awesome iGEM teammates, and the beautiful transformative power of Zumba (an ancient art)!
Aman Folami Reese
Aman is a second-year Molecular Engineering major looking to deconstruct the universe. He really enjoys shaking it in Zumba and giving out unsolicited information about random things. His interest include yoga, discovering new and obscure music, and the majority of anything food related.
Janice Chen
Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, Janice Chen is a sophomore attending University of Chicago. She plans to major in Biological Sciences with an specialization in Microbiology. Her current interests include volunteering with the Chinese-American Community, participating in Zumba classes with her fellow iGem team members, and walking along the beach on a wonderful day.
Linnea Lungstrom
Born in Chicago and raised in Minnesota, Linnea Lungstrom is a second-year Biological Sciences major at the University of Chicago.  She wants to specialize in genetics, but constantly fights an internal struggle on the topic of being a pre-med.  She loves volunteering for Peer Health Exchange, falling during Zumba classes with her amazing iGem team members, playing fetch with her dog, hammocking with her cat and cheering on the Cubs at Wrigley Field.
Allison Scott
Allison is a third year biology major at the University of Chicago. She is interested in pursuing a PhD in plant pathology after she finishes her undergraduate degree. She loves camping, hiking, and horseback riding, but hates the beach.
Steve DvorkinSteve is a Biological Sciences major and Junior attending the University of Chicago. His academic interests include molecular/synthetic biology, immunology, neuroscience, and psychology. He enjoys reading, playing music, and crafting Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. He's really proud of his primers, theyâ€™re like his children.
Vera Beilinson
Vera is a second year majoring in computational and applied math. Having spent months in South Africa rehabilitating orphaned baboons, she plans on using her skills to help the environment. Aside from being the web developer for Gene Hackers, Vera is also a calculus TA, cheerleader, and sailer.
Benjamin Glick
Benjamin Glick is a Professor of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology at the University of Chicago. He served as an invaluable resource to the Genehackers team during our experimental stage. Professor Glick received his B.A Neuroscience and Mathematics at Amherst College, and he then received his Ph.D in Biochemistry at Stanford University. The Glick lab specializes in ER-to-Golgi transport and the processes that generate Golgi stacks.
