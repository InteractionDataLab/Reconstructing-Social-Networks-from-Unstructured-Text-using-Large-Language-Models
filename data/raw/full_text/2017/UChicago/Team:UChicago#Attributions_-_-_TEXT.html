Special Thanks
GeneHackers members completed all of the wetlab work, research designs, and project documentation with supervision, feedback and advice from Professor Benjamin Glick (our PI); Jason Casler, Kasey Day, and DJ (our graduate student advisors); Steve Dvorkin and Allison Scott (Co-Presidents of GeneHackers, not on the summer team). GeneHackers members also built our wiki page and assembled our Jamboree poster and presentation with assistance from those mentioned above.
We used laboratory protocols developed by the GeneHackers team as well as by iGEM and the Glick laboratory.
The University of Chicago Office of Research Safety provided us with online biosafety training.
DNA sequencing was performed for us by UChicagoâ€™s Comprehensive Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility.
DNA was synthesized for us by IDT and Genscript.
Much thanks to the Glick lab for allowing us to use their laboratory space and equipment during the summer.
