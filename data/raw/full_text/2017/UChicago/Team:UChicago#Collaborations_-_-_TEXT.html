PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT
Over the summer, our iGEM team started corresponding with the Washington University in St. Louis team. We decided to collaborate with one another by testing both of our projects at the same time.
The WashU team is comparing the “effectiveness of several genes on the level of UV radiation tolerance in E. coli”. They are using four genes that provide UV resistance: uvsE, Dsup, phrAC and BCP. This October, they mailed us these four plasmids so we could put them into our chromosome-integrating plasmids (then transform them into yeast).
In our collaboration, we gave the WashU team advice in the building of their UV radiation machine. While we were unable to test their genes this year, we hope to continue our collaboration and further characterize their parts.
