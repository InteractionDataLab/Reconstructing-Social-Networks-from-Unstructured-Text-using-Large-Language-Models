Over the course of the project, we developed and tested three different versions of our hardware device. V1.0 (Lionel), V2.0 (Ludwig). V3.0 (Loki). We briefly describe these devices, and provide information as to their purpose and usage, as well as design and assembly files - ultimately enabling future recapitulation of our work. Furthermore, we demonstrate how we incorporated user feedback as we progressed along our project - notably in the case of the design for V4.0 (Lancelot). In conjunction with our human practices initiative, we had the opportunity to interview various stakeholders and ask for feedback regarding our hardware, and about how our design could be altered in order to integrate it into gene editing applications.</P><H3>General criteria considered when designing our devices</H3><UL class="bullets"><LI>A device that would deliver solely blue light at wavelength 465nm</LI><LI>A device that would insulate against ambient light and therefore minimize experimental error.</LI><LI>

V1.0 LIONEL is a simple solution to the need for a proof-of-concept device, and requires around 1-2 hours to make, and costs around $15(CAD). Lionel has been constructed onto a lightweight styrofoam rack, with a simple circuit built incorporating a 9V battery and LEDs with a breadboard. For the desired number of LEDs, circular holes were created at the bottom of the styrofoam rack in order to leave space for the LEDs to be inserted so that light could be delivered from below the tubes. The device is turned on and off by manually connecting the circuit, and samples must be covered in tinfoil in order to insulate them from ambient light and prevent LOV activity outside of experimental parameters. As can be seen from x, the device can be secured to an orbital shaker using a coil.</P><H3>List of Materials</H3><UL class="bullets"><LI>Styrofoam tube rack</LI><LI>Breadboard</LI><LI>Resistors</LI><LI>9V battery</LI><LI>Battery clip</LI><LI>Tape</LI><LI>LEDs  (465nm)</LI><LI>Aluminum foil</LI></UL><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1: (a) Top view of Lionel in action.

(a) shows the design of one level for a 12 wellplate. (b) Shows complete internal structure. (c) Shows the final enclosure, minus sliding panel and circuit.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>V4.0 Lancelot is a conceptual design intended to be compatible with gene editing applications in mammalian cells. When designing our CRISPR switch, we considered that the ultimate downstream application of such a tool would necessitate a re-design of our hardware, ensuring that our tool could be integrated into the target environment seamlessly. Throughout our interview series that constituted a part of our integrated human practices initiative, we consulted with stakeholders and received feedback on the design of previous versions of our hardware, with the aim to identify the features of a device that would make them compatible with mammalian gene editing applications.</P><P>Building off of V2.0 Ludwig and v3.0 Loki, we determined that various criteria of such a device were already being met - notably, our device was already compatible with various incubators commonly used for mammalian gene editing, and therefore certain needs (such as maintaining a sterile environment, regulating CO2 levels) were already being met.</P><P>Our stakeholders noted that while v3.0 Loki could also be used for mammalian gene editing applications, v2.0 Ludwig would be less useful, as 15ml tubes are not commonly employed when culturing or testing mammalian cells. The main criteria that inspired the design of v4.0 Lancelot was a need for a device that could be compatible with certain plate formats (either 6, 12, 24, or 96 well plates). As can be seen from the figure, Lancelot is compatible with 12 plate format, however we note that altering the design to 6 or 24 well plates is not difficult should the need arise.</P><P>Similar to v2.0 Ludwig and v3.0 Loki, v4.0 Lancelot would be cut from acrylic and light-proofed using tape. LEDs at the specific wavelength of LacILOV (465nm) are wired at the bottom, and would be controlled using an arduino microcontroller, with a simple user interface akin to prior versions. The plate would slide into the slot between dividers at the top and bottom, which would serve to isolate the light produced by LEDs to the well of the user’s choosing. The dividers therefore allow the user to confidently include samples that are meant to be kept in the dark into their experimental design. Similar to v3.0 Loki, v4.0 Lancelot would include a sliding panel that is kept secure by 3D printed hinges (not shown in figure). Ultimately, based from the feedback we received from our advisors, if constructed v4.0 Lancelot would serve as a valuable device that would aid the transition of LacILOV, and tools such as our switch, into mammalian gene editing applications.</P><P><A class="dashed" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/7e/T--Toronto--2017_lancelot.zip">Download Link for V4.0 Lancelot (STLs, Arduino Code)</A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="block sidebar"><DIV id="sidebar-box"><H3>Contents</H3><H3>Related Pages</H3><DIV class="sidebar-minibox"><UL><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Description">Description</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Design">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Results">Results</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section bg-black"><DIV class="container footer row"><DIV class="block content"><H3 class="white">General Pages</H3><UL><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto">Home</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Description">Description</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Team">Team</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Attributions">Attributions</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Collaborations">Collaborations</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Safety">Safety</A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="block content"><H3 class="white">Wet Lab</H3><UL><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Design">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Parts">Parts</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Hardware">Hardware</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Experiments">Experiments</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Notebook">Notebook</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/InterLab">InterLab</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Results">Results</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Demonstrate">Demonstrate</A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="block content"><H3 class="white">Dry Lab</H3><UL><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/ODE">ODE</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Analysis">Analysis</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Protein-Modelling">Protein Modelling</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Model">Model</A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="block content"><H3 class="white">Human Practices</H3><UL><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Interviews">Interviews</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Genetic_Code_Workshop">Genetic Code Workshop</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Podcast">Podcast</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Icon-a-thon">Icon-a-thon</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Guide">Guide</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/HP/Silver">HP/Silver</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/HP/Gold_Integrated">HP/Gold Integrated</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Toronto/Engagement">Engagement</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container footer-bottom row"><DIV class="block content"><P>iGEM Toronto</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
