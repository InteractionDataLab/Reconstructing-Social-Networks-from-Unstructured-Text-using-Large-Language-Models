Dry Lab
Ordinary Differential Equations
Capturing the dynamics of construct developed in the Wet Lab to further characterize its behaviour with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).

Analysis
Using Mathworks Simulink package, we ran multiple simulations to obtain a clear picture of how our system behaves. Then with R we leverage the data from Wet Lab to derive key parameters.

Modelling
We modeled LacILOV’s protein structure, which exposed undesirable interactions between the linker region and the functional domains. We then mutated the linker computationally to devise substitutions to improve LacILOV’s sensitivity to light.
