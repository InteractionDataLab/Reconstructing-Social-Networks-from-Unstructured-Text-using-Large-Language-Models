Safety
Safety is the number one priority
General Lab Safety
Before starting the project, our team completed the biosafety and the biosecurity trainings provided by the University of Toronto Biosafety office, and our project supervisor, Dr. Radhakrishnan Mahadevan. The training modules completed include lab access and rules, biosafety levels and equipment, emergency procedures etc.
Overall, our team adhered to the Canadian Biosafety Standards and Guidelines. [1] The biosafety of our lab was overseen by the University's Institutional Biosafety Committee, with administrative and technical support provided by the Biosafety Team in the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.
