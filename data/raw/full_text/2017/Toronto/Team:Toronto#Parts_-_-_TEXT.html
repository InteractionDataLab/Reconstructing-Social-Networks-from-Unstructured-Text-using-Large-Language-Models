LacILOV
BBa_K2469001
Basic
728
A fusion protein of the light, oxygen and voltage-sensitive domain of the Avena Sativa phototropin 1 (LOV2) and the LacI domain. This transcriptional regulator represses promoters under control of LacI. It is speculated that in the presence of blue light, LacILOV dissociates, causing it to unbind from DNA and allow transcription. In the absence of light, the protein dimerizes and binds to the promoter of lac operon, inhibiting the transcription of downstream genes.
