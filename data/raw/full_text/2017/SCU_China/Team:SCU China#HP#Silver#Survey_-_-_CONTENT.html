                                        connection with the vast public as well as the society. According to our shared
                                        daily experience, nowadays many people have trouble with sleeping, one of the
                                        most
                                        important and dominant, yet mysterious activity in our life. For the youth,
                                        social
                                        pressure brought by both work and family may lead to irregular sleeping time or

                                        or awakening easily – problems involving sleeping has become more and more
                                        common.      However, in order to determine more
                                        precisely
                                        the current sleeping conditions of the
                                        public and to evaluate more objectively about the people’s knowledge on
                                        melatonin –
                                        the core of our project, surveys are to be made. Though there are surveys on
                                        people’s sleeping quality made by CDC 1, The Sleep Council of the UK 2 and China
                                        Sleep Research Association 3 etc., the data are always too generalized and from

                                        few years ago; more importantly, there’s no existing research on the public’s
                                        awareness and acceptance of melatonin.      Therefore, our main focus in this survey is
                                        to
                                        answer 1) how is people’s sleeping
                                        quality, 2) what are the common problems that stalls people from sleeping. For
                                        the
                                        special groups that will go for night shifts, we also seek to know 3) frequency

                                        practicality of our project, we also investigated 4) how people regulate their
                                        sleep
                                        and the acceptance, usage of sleeping pills and 5) how are the understanding and
                                        acceptance of melatonin of both groups who have regular schedules and who have

                                        sleeping quality and mental state etc., the best way is to directly listen to

                                        people and ask them about their feeling. In this survey, we designed two

                                        sleeping conditions and to evaluate more
                                        objectively about the knowledge on melatonin of both the groups having normal
                                        schedules and having night shifts, we conducted two questionnaire survey
                                        targeting the two groups, respectively, and we get a deeper understanding of our
                                        questions.      Considering the people’s sleeping quality,
                                        the data apparently show that most
                                        people do not meet the healthy sleep time standard (≥ 8 hours). Besides the
                                        common sleep problems like going to bed too late or not having enough time to
                                        sleep, people suffer from other problems that affect their sleep quality like
                                        feeling difficult to fall asleep or easy to be waken up. The population in China
                                        is large, so the absolute number of people who have trouble with sleeping is
                                        enormous which makes this no trivial issue. As stated above in the Results
                                        section, many dominating sleeping problems result from the disrupted circadian
                                        clock, whose symptoms could be eased by taking exogenous melatonin.      As for the awareness of sleeping, we regard
                                        most of our respondents lack
                                        sufficient knowledge, which is reflected by their ways of regulating sleep and
                                        improving sleep quality – the methods are indeed traditional, but they have no
                                        apparent effect and easily falls into the range of placebo. To sleep better,
                                        know more about sleep first; science popularizing sessions and activities can
                                        serve as very good ways to arouse public attention and improve public awareness.      For the people who goes for night shifts,
                                        such as servicemen, flight attendance
                                        and medical staffs, most of our respondents go for more than 5 night shifts
                                        every month on average and have a much shorter sleep when they go off duty;
                                        their sleeping quality is more severely affected than the normal people, as
                                        indicated by both the objective statistics and subjective evaluation. What’s
                                        more, we also discovered that the older the more likely that one would go for
                                        night shifts (see Supplementary Material); the adjusting capability of circadian
                                        rhythm declines as aging, which enforced the negative effects of night
                                        shifts.      There are people who uses sleeping pills to
                                        regulate their sleep, and most of
                                        them uses traditional tablets like Barbital and Diazepam. The public showed
                                        widespread ignorance on the new medicine of melatonin, and many are suspicious
                                        about its effect. The people having night shifts accept melatonin more, and many
                                        are willing to try it. This inspires us that we still have to publicize
                                        melatonin more so more people could get known of its positive effects and
                                        benefit from it.      Though our survey would be more objective
                                        when conducted on a larger sample, we
                                        still regard the data and results valid and could be used to guide our
                                        project.

                                        influence our sleep? As there are so many different claims about this question,
                                        we decided to interview professors of West China sleeping center as an authority
                                        to confirm the effects that melatonin has on sleep. The sleeping center once
                                        carried on a project about developing a melatonin sustained release tablets.
                                        Also, it has done lots of other researches on melatonin. Thus, we believed West
                                        China sleeping center would give us the authoritative answer we want. With the
                                        help of team “SCU-WestChina”, we got in touch with Professor Tang Xiangdong and

                                        potential use of melatonin as a common
                                        medicine for sleep disorder. As Doctor Zhang mentioned, melatonin, with a short
                                        half-life, is more appropriate for sleep disorder due to smaller 'hangover'
                                        effects on the following morning. And previous studies indicate that patients
                                        are unlikely to develop dependence and tolerance on melatonin. Doctor Zhang
                                        emphasized that our project, using microorganism to produce melatonin in
                                        intestine, is more economical compared with chemical method. So we were
                                        convinced that our project is possible to generate economic benefits in the
                                        future.      Additionally, with the help of Doctor Zhang,
                                        we found there were so many things
                                        to do in order to optimize our project. For safety purposes, we were recommended
                                        to use a safer bacterial strain in the final products. What’s more, Doctor Zhang
                                        explained sleep associated neural circuits to us, which enlightened us to
                                        consider the relationship of melatonin expression and sleep associated neural
                                        circuits or other neural activities.

                                        gave a presentation on their projects. Some of these projects illustrate how
                                        melatonin worked in our sleeping process. We have learned a lot about most

                                        as well as safety and potential market value of melatonin, we sent emails to
                                        consult a staff member of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).      From this online interview, we have learnt that there are specific criterions
                                        for different health products. The test always includes pesticide effect,
                                        physicochemical properties and bacteria levels. Generally, products without high
                                        purity have difficulties in passing the test, and melatonin in the market was
                                        produced by chemical synthesis, whose major problem is that by-products produced
                                        in chemical production and those catalysts are toxic. Thus, biosynthesis of
                                        melatonin in our project will be of great practical application value. However,
                                        the existing drugs made from bacteria are used to improve digest ability merely.
                                        So it is uncertain whether our final products can appear on the market or not.
                                        But we are inspired to consider a safer bacteria strain used in our project in
                                        terms of present microbial products in the future.      In addition, the staff member of CFDA mentioned that melatonin has a high pass
                                        rate in the test, which convinced us of the potential usage of our expected
                                        products. Also, we have learnt that people having special work often take
                                        melatonin health products regularly. Hence, it is necessary to research and
                                        develop a more efficient melatonin health product.
