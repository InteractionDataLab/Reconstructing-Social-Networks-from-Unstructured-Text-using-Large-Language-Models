                                    had done, what challenges they had met, what we could do to help them, and what they
                                    could do to help us.

                                    “SCU-WestChina” showed their project “Blocking Urate Storm in the Blood” of that
                                    day, in which they wanted to apply attenuated Salmonella typhimurium in their
                                    dialysis-like device. In the meeting, team “TMMU-China” and we both raised the
                                    question – why use Salmonella typhimurium, a kind of pathogenic bacteria, instead of
                                    a kind of probiotic bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis or Bacillus subtilis, which
                                    may reduce their workload and enhance biosafety. After their comprehensive
                                    consideration, they adopted our suggestion. Nevertheless, when team “SCU-WestChina”
                                    showed that they would measure the absolute strength of the constitutive promoter
                                    family (including BBa_J23100, etc.) to meet the need for their modeling, we
                                    suggested that they can try to measure it with RiboJ, a ribozyme which self cleaves,
                                    removing the upstream region, most importantly the 5’ untranslated region. Because
                                    according to 2016 William and Mary’s results, RiboJ can eliminate the effect of
                                    different coding sequence on the gene expression dynamics, we thought it may
                                    effectively improve the reliability of “SCU-WestChina”’s measurement and modeling.
                                    And then, our advice was integrated with SCU-WestChina’s measurement. What’s more,
                                    we were inspired by their modeling of constitutive promoter family to make our
                                    modeling of enzyme kinetics by ourselves, in order to achieve more efficient
                                    production of melatonin with reasonable formula of enzymes.</P><DIV class="scu_hp_image_single2"><P class="scu_img_index"> Fig.3 </P></DIV><P class="scu_content_p">       At that time, we still had
                                    3 alternative projects, one of which is about oral vaccine of rabies. After our
                                    presentation of our three candidate projects, instructor of Team “TMMU-China”, a
                                    professor with vast experience in immunology research, reminded us that such
                                    immunology experiments are extremely time-consuming and the results of such
                                    experiments usually are non-predictable, which may be exceedingly hard to finish the
                                    project of oral vaccine rabies in no more than 3 months. Comparing this project to
                                    our other two projects and considering his advice carefully, we gave up this project
                                    and chose the project, “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli”, ultimately.      On the other hand, communication and
                                    collaboration of iSWU was not only at the
                                    meet-up, but also before and after the meeting.      Before the iSWU meet-up, team “SiCAU-China”, a
                                    new iGEM team, contacted with us for
                                    some parts in 2016 DNA distribution to prepare for their preliminary experiments.
                                    And we took those plasmids to them at the meetup. Caused by our carelessness, we put
                                    the LUDOX in the -20 degrees centigrade as we did last year, leading to all of LUDOX
                                    in 2017 kit precipitating. However, we wanted to participate in this year’s InterLab
                                    study, which should use LUDOX as materials. Thus, we sought help in the Wechat group
                                    of “iSWU”; thankfully, team “SiCAU-China” provided us with LUDOX in their
                                    measurement kit immediately, which is vital for us to finish our InterLab study.      We really enjoyed ourselves communicating with
                                    so many other iGEMers and developed a
                                    lot of new ideas about our project. The iSWU provide a communication platform and
                                    collaboration opportunities for iGEMers in Southwest union,which is good for
                                    improving the iGEM project and giving a new sight. At the same time, the union is
                                    propitious to the development of iGEM in southwest China.We are looking forward to
                                    the coming of more new friends.

                                        concentration of fluorescein was high. We told them it might be the result of

                                        Coincidently, we found that project of team “Peking” this year has close
                                        relation to repressilator, which is vital to our project. Thus, our two teams
                                        had a deep communication about the design and related experiments of
                                        repressilator. What’s more, after CCiC, we still stayed in contact. And once we
                                        turned to them for ΔclpXP E.coli strain, they mailed it to us, which really did
                                        us a great favor.
                                        In CCiC, we showed our project in many ways, by speech, by poster, by
                                        introduction…. And so did other teams. So that, we could learn from other teams
                                        how to present our project better and make it more attractive.
                                        Generally speaking, CCiC is an excellent opportunity for us to communicate with
                                        other iGEMers and improve our project. What’s more, it have greatly promoted the
                                        development of synthetic biology and iGEM in China.
