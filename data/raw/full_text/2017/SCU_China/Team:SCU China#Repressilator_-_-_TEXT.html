OVERVIEW
Repressilator
1.Background
      Repressilator is a tripartite device                                             consisting of 3 repressors that can                                             form a closed negative feedback loop and generate periodically oscillation.                                             It is artificially designed and put into E.coli for functional tests which                                             was proved for successful oscillation in vivo. Well-defined repressilator is                                             thought to possess the precision that rivals nature systems which can be put                                             into various practical application.
2.Aim
Our manipulations on repressilator are as follows:
1) We want to determine the period of solitary repressilator or coupled one or in different strains in our laboratory condition via triple reporters on utilized plasmid pLPT107.
2) IPTG is added to primarily synchronized the colony and we planned to verify this effect.
3) Instead of inviting engineered E.coli into living organism, we propose to validate the integration condition of engineered E.coli into artificial intestinal juice.
4) Build clpXP knock-out MC4100 strain to guarantee more stable oscillation period.
3.Achievement
1) Constructed bacteria strains obeyed a 2 hour                                                 period in experimental                                                 condition.
2) iPTG addition could help direct a more                                                 robust synchronization in colony                                                 by amplify the oscillating amplitude.
3) Engineered strains could colonize stably                                                 in artificial intestinal fluid                                                 and the oscillation pattern kept uniformity as in culture media.
4) We successfully knocked out clpXP gene in                                                 position, however residual of                                                 pKD46 made our modified strain fail to select for ampicillin resistance                                                 of                                                 pLPT107.

Repressilator Coupled with Quorum Sensing
1. Background
Quorum sensing (QS) is a well-known natural system of prokaryotes in order                                             to sense the population density with in a community. Recently, increasing                                             researches begin paying close attention to QS system for extended use. QS                                             can build connections among population in not only quorum density but also                                             other information of intracellular status if coupled with signals from                                             another system, which makes it a feasible and convenient tool for                                             intercellular communication.
2. Aim
Quorum sensing is first added into our circuit to solve three main problems:
1) synchronize the repressilator coherently to achieve a precise population scale oscillation.
2) send and modulate periodic signal with enzyme (COMT) expression and  coupling melatonin synthesis.
2. Achievement
1) Optimize the modelling work in 2000 and                                                     complete design 4p0, 3p1 system.
2) Confirm quorum sensing in our circuit.
3) Successfully build the                                                     represillator-combined QS circuit. And cell B in 4p0 system.

RBS Modification
1.Background
      Modeling results of repressilator                                             indicated that faster translation is                                             helpful to the period elongation, which is necessary to mimic the process of                                             melatonin production in human. Translation initiation is the rate-limiting                                             step of translation. Its rate is determined by multiple molecular                                             interactions, including the hybridization of the 16S rRNA to the RBS                                             sequence. Thus, we can change the translation rate via the modification of                                             RBS.
2. Aim
1) We want to improve the translation rate of                                                     the original device (BBa_I13521) by modifing its ribosome binding site.
2) We want to confirm the methods of RBS                                                     prediction and plasmid construction could be credible.
3. Achievement
1) We have designed 3 synthetic RBS with                                                     different strength by RBS Calculator.
2) We have replaced the RBS in the original                                                     reporter part (BBa_I13521).
3) We have measured the strength of our                                                     designed RBS, and confirmed the increase of translation rate.
4) We have confirmed that the methods we used were credible.
