Quorum Sensing(QS)
01  Background
      Quorum sensing, or the                                     control of gene expression in response to cell density, is used by both                                     gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to regulate a variety of physiological and                                     chemical functions. In all cases, quorum sensing involves the production and                                     detection of extracellular signalling molecules called autoinducers. While universal                                     signalling themes exist, variations in the design of the extracellular signals, the                                     signal detection apparatuses, and the biochemical mechanisms of signal relay have allowed quorum sensing systems to be exquisitely adapted for their varied uses,                                     enabling bacteria to architect complex community structures. [2]
02  Design
      Quorum sensing is first integrated into our                                     circuit to solve three main problems:                                     1. The plasmid (pLPT107) we get is totally 9800bp three reporters (CFP/YFP/RFP)                                     contained and if we insert the four melatonin synthases (5800bp) into pLPT107, the                                     whole plasmid will ultimately reach 15600bp which is too big to transform                                     efficiently into bacteria.
2. Three repressors, four enzymes and at least one reporter give the cell such a                                     heavy protein synthesis pressure. And it may greatly influence the growth rate of                                     E.coli. So it is better to divide two system into two cells and combine each other                                     with inner-related QS.
3. A more regular and precise oscillating pattern still could not be obtained in our                                     previous part. So QS have been settled on as a cell-cell communication pathway to                                     urge the bacteria synchronize in a coherent oscillatory state, according to a                                     computational modeling work in 2000[1].                                     It is predicted that diverse and noisy community of such genetic oscillators interacting through a quorum-sensing mechanism could self-synchronize in a robust                                     way, leading to a substantially improved global rhythmicity in the system.
      To illustrate the QS function in synchronizing                                     repressilator network, we used three GIF to help understand this process and                                     relative logic.
GIF1. Normal repressilator without QS
      As shown in the curves, the concentration of                                     three repressors varies alternatively                                     and the peak for each one is followed by the peak of the other one that repress it.                                     So in the time scale if taking TetR into account at the very beginning, the adjacent                                     peak must belong to LacI because just LacI inhibits the expression of TetR and once                                     TetR protein concentration decreases, it indicts that increasing LacI protein level                                     has exceeded the pLac promoter threshold and tetR gene has been repressed. In other                                     words TetR decrease because LacI increase and this logical order are able to be                                     transferred to the concentration peak order in time scale. This logic is applicable for all three repressors because they are logically symmetry.
GIF.2 AHL synthesis period
      The ultimate QS circuit is pCI LuxI-J23106                                     LuxR-pTet/Lux pR Hybrid promoter CI as shown in part2. And LuxI (controlled by pCI                                     promoter) is expressed when CI lambda repressor concentration is low enough                                     (threshold) and this situation only appear when cellular TetR concentration is over                                     threshold/TetR dominant in a oscillating period. Then LuxI will catalyze AHL                                     synthesis and AHL can defuse freely in and out of the cell as a small nonpolar                                     molecule.
GIF.3 Synchronous repressilator with QS
      Part 3 displays the impact of quorum sensing on                                     repressilator. LuxR is constitutively expressed in the cell and in the early                                     nonsynchronous stage different cells may produce AHL at different phase so Quorum                                     Sensing especially in some limited area could initiate at any time corresponding to                                     any repressilator phase and may have various impact. According to our design                                     pTet/Lux pR hybrid promoter should have a basic property that once TetR protein                                     concentration exceeds threshold downstream CI transcription will be inhibited no                                     matter QS happen or not. This property remove the QS impact on repressilator’s TetR                                     dominant stage. As for CI dominant phase the actual effective period is between TetR                                     concentration early increasing state to peak (accurately shortly before peak because                                     central dogma lead to a time delay, which means although gene is repressed but                                     protein concentration still increase for the mRNA remaining) and if additive CI is                                     expressed the whole CI dominant phase will not elongate for the reason that CI                                     protein half-life is determined by itself.
      Summarily, the QS have the most obvious impact                                     on LacI rapid increasing phase in one                                     oscillating period. Because at this period of time if QS activate additive CI                                     expression, LacI gene will be repressed simultaneously and quickly ‘jump’ to CI                                     dominant phase after a short period of time. Comparing with normal repressilator                                     circuit, QS inserted one give the coherent a only LacI phase shift every QS happens, which render those bacteria ‘chase’ to achieve a much more synchronous stage.
      Based on this modelling work, two circuit named                                     4p0＆3p1 are designed to provide a theoretically feasible solution and achieve the                                     ultimate macroscopic, population-scale oscillation. Both two plans comprise two                                     parts—cell A and cell B which include repressilator plus quorum sensing system and                                     synthases system respectively. The Major difference between our design and that in                                     the paper is we choose CI-lambda to control the expression of LuxI (AHL synthase)                                     and pTet-LuxpR hybrid promoter (BBa_K176000) for QS CI repressor, because pLac                                     (LacO1 promoter) exists leak expression phenomenon.
Fig.2a 3p1 circuit
      In “4p0” system, luxI gene of the “enzyme cell”                                     is replaced by COMT                                     (rate-controlling enzyme of melatonin synthesis pathway) gene. Therefore, with high                                     level of repressor TetR in “repressilator cells”, COMT will be expressed in “enzyme                                     cells”. In this way, QS circuit can transfer and modulate the rhythmic signal from                                     “repressilator cells” to “enzyme cells” via AHL concentration fluctuation and then                                     ‘enzyme cells’ receive the signal and modulate the COMT expression with periodical                                     pattern. In this system QS functions not only as ‘synchronizor’ but also ‘modulator’                                     assist the whole working steadily and efficiently.
Fig.2a 4p0 circuit
      Cell A-Repressilator cell For “repressilator cells”, circuit can be seen as two system (QS and Repressilator)                                     inner-related with each other via pCI controlled LuxI and additive hybrid promoter                                     induced CI lamba. pCI-LuxI is thought as the Repressilator output/QS input, matching                                     with QS output/Repressilator input to form a bistable system, and simultaneously                                     negative feedback pattern in QS circuit increases the potential balance or synchrony                                     of whole system.
      Cell B-Enzyme cell Two similar gene circuit consists of following parts-constitutively expressed luxR,                                     tetR (+LVA tag target for its quick degradation) controlled by luxpL promoter,                                     fluorescent protein mOrange controlled by pTet promoter (These three are identical                                     for both) and luxI under the control of pTet promoter just for 3p1 comparing to COMT                                     just for 4p0. The whole circuit is encoded on pSB1C3 plasmid in Escherichia coli                                     strain BL21/DHL708 which are used to express enzymes in melatonin synthesis pathway.
      When the level of repressor TetR is high, the                                     expression of CI is inhibited, which                                     contribute to the expression of LuxI catalyzing the synthesis of acyl-homoserine                                     lactone (AHL), a signaling molecules in bacterial quorum sensing. Subsequently, AHL                                     starts to defuse and accumulate in bacterial population as a small molecule. When                                     the amount of AHL reach the threshold, bacterial quorum sensing in both cells are                                     initiated rapidly. In this circumstance, constitutively expressed LuxR can interact                                     with AHL and then have conformational changes for binding to and inhibit/activate                                     luxpL/R promoter. As a consequence, in the cell B the amount of TetR (+LVA tagged)                                     repressors expressed will fall down quickly and then the following pTet promoter                                     will be activated, while in the cell A this impact on the pTet/LuxpR hybrid promoter                                     are not determined by effective LuxR (binding AHL) but dominantly by inner cell TetR repressor’s concentration. In other words, although quorum sensing has initiated if                                     the number of the TetR repressors are still high enough (over the threshold) the                                     hybrid promoter will ultimately maintain in a repressed state.                                     In “3p1” system, this gene circuit is used for accumulate AHL in bacterial                                     population more quickly. Mathematical and computational predictions have suggested                                     that the oscillation is much more stable and regular if the amount of AHL is large                                     enough. When the level of repressor TetR is high in “repressilator cells”, LuxI will                                     be expressed in “enzyme cells” which contribute to the synthesis of AHL. On this                                     occasion, both “repressilator cells” and “enzyme cells” produce AHL in bacterial                                     population. As a result, it will take less time to reach stable stage, with                                     fluorescent protein mOrange indicting whether the circuit works as expected. And we                                     rename QS system ‘synchronizor’.

3.1 Quorum sensing basic property
     To confirm QS function                                     in architect cell-cell communication we build LuxpR-GFP-constitutive (J23106)                                     LuxR-pSB1C3, pTet-LuxI/pCI-LuxI-pSB1C3 and pTet/LuxpR hybrid promoter-J23106                                     LuxR-J23106 TetR-pSB1C3 via co-culture and additive AHL. pTet-LuxI/pCI-LuxI-pSB1C3                                     are exclusively built and tested because they can constitutive or semi-constitutive                                     express LuxI(AHL synthase) when the TetR/CI-Lambda repressor are not added in and                                     both are key components for QS modulator system in 3p1/4p0 circuit. All circuits                                     referring to are transformed into E.coli DHL708 and BL21 simultaneously for the                                     reason that four melatonin synthase are designed to express in BL21 or DHL708 and                                     pTet/LuxpR hybrid promoter-Lambda as the QS output versus repressilator input have                                     to be confirmed in DHL708. Function of LuxR transcriptional activator (Lux pR) is                                     confirmed in both GFP reporter and hybrid promoter-RFP circuits after co-culture                                     with DHL708/BL21 pTet-LuxI/pCI-LuxI for about 13 hours. Several nutrition and                                     culture conditions (M9/LB/artificial intestinal fluid) are set to explore the QS                                     threshold in different milieu, especially artificial intestinal fluid are used to                                     mimic the QS in the intestine. pCI-LuxI and Hybrid promoter-J23106 LuxR-J23106 TetR                                     (known as UHP) are co-cultured in same wells of a 96-well plate with formula 8uL                                     pCI-LuxI DHL708 bacteria liquid culture/ 8uL UHP bacteria liquid culture/ 134 uL                                     corresponding blank culture medium and UHP DHL708 used in this section is                                     conditioned with 80 ng/mL ATc 4 hours before measurement( aTc+ indicted in the                                     figure). Continuous incubation in plate reader for 37 degree Celsius and measure RFP                                     fluorescence (580/630 nm) every 15 mins. Supplementary blank mediums are added in                                     the measurement process because culture medium is evaporating in 37℃ incubation and                                     the bacteria are diluted after this, shown as black arrow in the figure. As Figure                                     3a,b, indicts, the OD is about 0.1 at the 0 time point, while the fluorescence/OD                                     (means the relative RFP protein concentration in cell unit) start at a low level                                     about 8000 A.U. per OD. It is obvious that fluorescence for all four groups begin                                     increase exponentially at about 60-75mins latter with the OD600 reaching 0.2. As for                                     pTet-LuxI/UHP-aTc+ groups pTet-LuxI BL21 are also designed to co-culture with                                     UHP-aTc+ DHL708 because pTet-LuxI is necessary in 3p1 cell B. Slightly different                                     from pCI-LuxI/UHP-aTc+ groups, data exhibits that mainly after 135mins groups begin                                     early exponential phase, with OD600 reaching 0.25-0.3.

BL21 growths slower than DHL708 so its OD                                     threshold for QS may be 0.25-0.3.

As indicted, 5ug/mL AHL start to have obvious                                         transcriptional activation phenomenon.comparing to the negtive control, which                                         may suggest that the threshold AHL concentration for QS is between 3ug/mL to                                         5ug/mL

3.3 iPTG imitation
      According to the computational modelling                                     results, we find QS system function like iPTG synchronize in the early state                                     (video), which all accelerate the oscillating period for those in LacI dominant                                     period but not in the rest (TetR＆CI). So during a few following generations this                                     pattern will assist the coherent to achieve self-sychrony. And to imitate this                                     process different concentration(100uM/250uM/500uM/1000uM) of iPTG is added in the                                     culture M9 medium and use to incubate the DHL708+pLPT107.       We measure this oscillation pattern and period                                     during whole project totally for                                     three times and all shown in Figure 5. At the first time, we dilute the bacteria                                     every 60-90 minutes to maintain the coherent OD600 into the 0.2-0.5 interval to keep                                     it in growth exponential phase and we get the oscillating period for about 2 hours,                                     seriously it is really a little bit short and not so convincing because we do not                                     valuate the influence the dilution work to the data accuracy and maybe the                                     2-hour-period result from the dilution. For the second time we continuous 37℃                                     incubate the bacteria into plate reader for 10 hours and acquire each data point per                                     30mins, but as indicts the so called period become much more irregular. More data                                     points are needed to do further analysis, so we have our third                                     measurement—continuous incubate 13 hours and gain each point for 15mins, however,                                     still similar pattern. In our modelling work, we analyze this phenomenon and give a                                     reasonable explanation that the coherent are not well synchronized just via iPTG so                                     we hope after QS system is inserted into the repressilator, the oscillation could be                                     urged into a much more steadily synchronous stage.

04  future
1. Repeat DHL708ΔclpXP and MC4100 repressilator measurement for more than 30 hours to                                 confirm oscillation.
2. Insert QS circuit (pCI LuxI-J23106 LuxR-pTet/LuxpR hybrid promoter Lambda) into                                 repressiltor pLPT107 by replacing mCFP and mKate2 reporter as indicted in fig2 and                                 measure the oscillation pattern of this optimized one (period ＆ regular or not).
3. Repeat pTet/LuxpR hybrid promoter confirmation work.
