OVERVIEW
Huge scale of our experimental design based firmly on                                         modelling results, for instance, the optimal proportioning of synthetase, the                                         modification on repressilator and so on.Modelling instruction pulled through the                                         whole project for less defect trials and more efficient variable adjustment.

1.Why we did this model?
1) Synthetic genetic circuits work                                                     comparatively to a higher degree resemble electric circuits. In                                                     especial, repressilator is not only an artificial system which                                                     kinetic parameters and stability of the system remain to be                                                     determined, but also a dynamic and complicated loop that has those intrinsic regulation on its components themselves. So we need to                                                     connect it smoothly with Melatonin sybthesis.
2) Human work and rest time is about 24 hours,                                                     which is quite beyond the results shown in the reference. So we                                                     ought to elongate its period as long as possible.
3) We have no reason to believe that cells’                                                     repressilator will start to work at the same time. So in a cluster                                                     of cells, generally, the time to reach expression peak value is                                                     different from each other, and we can easily imagine that the                                                     average expression of cells must be a random noise. The only                                                     solution to this is to find a way to synchronize their oscillation                                                     and make sure they are stable.
2.How was our model constructed?
1) We derived the system step by step with                                                     ordinary differential equations. Secondly, we added quorum sensing                                                     part to the original equations.
2) We estimated the diffusion time to analyze                                                     the behavior of quasi-steady-state. With the derivations above, we                                                     got the final equations to describe our system.
3) Different situations of delayed system were                                                     analyzed by changing the strength of quorum sensing.
4) A numerical simulation of 900 cells was ran                                                     to see the expression of Melatonin by linking it with CFP comparing                                                     our experimental result.
3.What did the modeling tell us?
Problem(1) is related to our modeling part of                                                     Melatonin. It can give us a                                                     possible way to make sure the concentration of NAS is stable.                                                     Problem(2) is                                                     simple. According to the modeling result, we just need to decrease                                                     protein                                                     lifetime or increase mRNA lifetime. Approximately, we may be able to                                                     elongate the period to 1.5-3 hours. Furthermore, if we can have 4 to                                                     5 times                                                     mRNA lifetime, we may hopefully reach 12 hours. As for problem(3),                                                     we would                                                     have to enhance the strength of quorum sensing. A simple way is just                                                     to make                                                     those cells feel a crowded environment.

Melatonin

1.Why we did this model?
1） Extra energy consumption of heterologous                                                     expression is not conducive to cell growth, which may lead to                                                     unpredictable sideeffects. Therefore, we ought to select the best                                                     promoter combination so that we could make best use of E.coli’s                                                     energy consumption to make sure cells won’t be so ‘tired’.
2） Different promoters come with different rate                                                     parameters. Supposing that we measured all kinds of combination, we                                                     would be able to see different production rate of N-acetylserotonin.                                                     Only in this way, a complex enzyme reaction system can have a                                                     cost-effective production rate.
2.How was our model constructed?
1) We introduced traditional Michaelis-Menten                                                     theory.
2) It’s poor when it is applied on a complex                                                     enzyme reaction system since the by-production’s starting                                                     concentration is zero instead of several magnitudes larger than the                                                     enzyme.
3) We improved the theory by making the                                                     reaction fully reversible. The comparison in our modeling showed the                                                     difference.
4) We even figured out a possible way to                                                     measure the relative rate parameters in each reaction, since our new                                                     theory require much more parameters than the traditional theory. At                                                     last, a numerical ideal result is shown.
3.What did the modeling tell us?
The modeling part tells us the possible result                                                     of the complex enzyme reactions in cellA. Apparently, numerically                                                     solving a 12-dimension enzyme equations’ result is far better than                                                     traditional Michaelis-Menten equations. With different promoters, To                                                     be honest, some parameters are still hard to measure, but we believe                                                     that we would get the result of different kind of promoter                                                     combination if we successfully measured those parameters.

RBS Modification
1.Why we did this model?
1) Modeling results of repressilator indicated                                                     that faster translation is helpful to the period elongation, which                                                     is necessary to mimic the process of melatonin production in human.
2) RBS sequence is a main determinant of                                                     translation rate, so we decided to design some RBS with higher                                                     strength.
3) Random mutation of RBS will generate a huge                                                     library, which will increase our workload grandly with numbers of                                                     useless mutations.
4) Bioinformatics method can predict the                                                     sequence                                                     of a synthetic RBS with a target translation initiation rate on a                                                     proportional scale, without too many experiments.
2.How was our model constructed?
1) We designed our RBS via the RBS calculator                                                     tools (https://salislab.net/software/doForwardRBS).
2) The RBS Calculator is based on the theory                                                     that build on previous work that characterized the free energies of                                                     key molecular interactions involved in translation initiation and on                                                     measurements of the sequence-dependent energetic changes that occur                                                     during RNA folding and hybridization.
3.What did the modeling tell us?
We designed a set of RBS with different                                                     strength of predicted translation rate, and chose three of them,                                                     named P1, P2, P3, which were predicted to be 5、10、50 times stronger                                                     than B0034 respectively. And then, we did some experiments for                                                     characterization.
