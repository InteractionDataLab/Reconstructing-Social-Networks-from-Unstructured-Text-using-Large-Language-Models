02  Detail of Methods
Details of Transformation
Aquae sterilisata was used to dissolve the DNA powder in kit.                                 After the certain DNA was dissolved, it was kept in -20 degrees centigrade fridge, as                                 well as the DNA powder. When we prepared transformation experiment, competent cells and                                 the DNA was taken out and defrosted on the ice. Mixture of DNA and competent cells was                                 done out of the biosafety cabinet while adding of liquid LB was in it. Solid LB                                 contained 2% agar and chloramphenicol was added before making plates. Parafilm was used                                 to prevent the fast evaporation of plates in incubator.
Details of Measurement
      When we did the measurement. The cabinet was shined                                 by ultraviolet before start for 30 minutes. One person (name C for convenience) took                                 500μl from each culture tube to a EP tube, then gave it to one person out of the cabinet                                 (name B) to test the original OD600. Then, C prepared enough 50ml tubes with 12ml liquid                                 LB in it (chloramphenicol preadded), and B calculated the dilution way according to the                                 excel provided on official website. When the calculation was done, C piped out certain                                 volume of LB and added bacterial culture, then shook to mix and took 500μl as the sample                                 of 0 hour. After the first sampling, we took out the culture from incubator (220rpm,                                 37℃) every 2 hours, with the first sampling time denoting 0 hour.
      Plates with black frame and transparent, flat bottom                                 were used to do the measurement. Since we did the experiment many times resulting from                                 some accidents, we recycled the plates. Plates were cleaned by distilled water and 75%                                 ethanol. Plate reader and relative software was manipulated by a teacher due to the                                 requirement of the lab.
Details of Preservation and Verification
      After picking up single colonies, the plates were                                 kept in -4 degrees centigrade fridge.                                 Bacterial glycerol stocks were prepared with the final glycerol concentration being 25%.
      When we decided to use them, we first re-activated                                 them by plate streaking, then picked                                 single colonies for subsequent work. Sequencing using prime VF2 and VR was done by                                 sending bacterial culture to Chengdu Tsingke zixi Limited Company. Sequencing results                                 were aligned with sequences in iGEM Registry and all of them were right.

      We did the measurement for                                 several times after transformation. Since some mistake occurred at the beginning, we only uploaded the data of the last                                 measurement. Here we show our result in figure 1, 2, 3, 4, representing for the                                 fluorescein standard curve, curve of OD600, fluorescent strength and μM fluorescein per                                 OD600 respectively. Data were calculated in the excel provided by iGEM official website.                                 Blank control had been considered before plotting.

NC and PC means the negative control and positive control respectively. Biological                                     replicates were considered together and error bar shows the standard error of all                                     the eight replicates.

Biological replicates were considered together and error bar shows the standard                                     error of all the eight replicates.

Biological replicates were considered together and error bar shows the standard                                     error of all the eight replicates.
      According to these figures, we can conclude that in the aspect of                                 promoter strength, J23101 is greater than J23106 and J23106 is greater than J23117, and                                 in the aspect of RBS strength, B0034 is greater than J364100 (Figure 3, 4). Difference                                 in RBS strength may be related to the length of spacer between SD sequence in RBS and                                 start codon. We can also see that the growth of D1 and D4 were relatively influenced                                 (Figure 2), suggesting J23101 may have a negative effect on bacterial growth, though the                                 protein expression is relatively high.
04  Acknowledgement and Collaboration
      Caused by our carelessness, we put the Ludox in the -20 degrees                                 centigrade and all of them precipitated. Here we sincerely acknowledge team                                 “SiCAU-China” to provide us extra Ludox.       We sincerely gratitude the work done by some freshmen, Caiqin Wang, Tian Liu, Chenming                                 Zhang, Yuanhan Yang, Yanling Zhong, Changhe Li (names listed in no particular order), in                                 InterLab study.       We helped Team SCU-WestChina by giving them some of our bacterial glycerol stocks, and                                 their feedback showed that our transformation was successful.       When we plotted the standard curve, we found that the fluorescent strength seemed lower                                 than expected when fluorescence concentration is very high. Thus, we described this                                 phenomenon in the WeChat group of iSWU for some suggestion. Thankfully, student leader                                 of team “SiCAU-China” told us that that may be caused by the inner filter effect; that                                 is to say, when the concentration of fluorescence is very high, the excitation light                                 cannot fully excited all of them, causing the decrease of fluorescent strength. We also                                 shared this point in CCiC (Central China iGEM Consortium).
