                                scientific fields. It is more and more difficult to finish a research project by
                                individual group of researchers. As for us, helps from other iGEM teams were vital to
                                our project improvement, experiments and human practices. In the other hand, we tried
                                our best to gave support to those iGEMers in need as well.
                                This year, there are totally 5 iGEM teams, SCU-WestChina, Peking, SiCAU-China,
                                TMMU_China and Purdue collaborated with SCU_China, either through one directional help

                                variable. The details of our collaboration are listed below:
