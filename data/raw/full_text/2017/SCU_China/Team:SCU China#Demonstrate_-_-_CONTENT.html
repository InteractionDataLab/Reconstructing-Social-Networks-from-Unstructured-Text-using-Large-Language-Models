                                with team “Purdue”, we knew that they prepare to do an in vitro colonization assay to
                                see if their genetically modified E. coli could survive in the target place. Inspired by
                                their thought, we also designed a series of in vitro experiments in order to investigate
                                if our constructed bacteria could survive in gastrointestinal tract.

                                designed. One of them is to
                                investigate if our genetically modified E. coli could adapt the physical environment of
                                gastrointestinal tract. We cultured the bacteria in artificial gastral juice and
                                intestinal juice, plotted the growth curve and compared with strains cultured in LB.
                                Another part is to test if our bacteria had the ability to compete with the native
                                microbiota in gastrointestinal tract. Based on such an idea, we obtain the feces of mice
                                from College of Pharmacy in our university and coculture them under different
                                conditions. Competent cells of MC4100 were made based on TSS method and transformed by
                                KCM transformation method (see notebook in detail).      Main materials used in these experiments are shown

                                colonies were picked based on colony color. Liquid culture was made and incubated
                                overnight. After incubation for about 12~16h, culture was sampled and original OD600 was
                                measured. Then culture was diluted until OD600 = 0.02, which relied on calculation excel
                                of InterLab measurement offered on official website. 1mL Diluted culture was allocated
                                into a 10mL tube mixed with 1mL artificial gastral juice or intestinal juice. Nine
                                identical tubes were prepared to do the test at an interval of 3 hours from time 0 to
                                time 24 hours. Three biological replicates were made and growth curves were plotted

                                relatively better than DH5 alpha in pure LB. Compared with culture in pure LB, it is
                                easy to see that the growth of constructed strain will be influenced in either
                                artificial gastral juice or artificial intestinal juice. We can also get the conclusion
                                that MC4100 is more sensitive to artificial gastral juicy rather than intestinal juice,
                                probably suggesting its vulnerability to acidic environment. In general, our data shows
                                that the constructed bacteria can survive in an environment mimicking gastrointestinal
                                tract to some extent, though their growth will be affected.</P><DIV class="scu_acma_subtitle">2.2 Coculture with microbiota in mice feces</DIV><P class="scu_content_p">      Feces of mice were obtained from College of Pharmacy

                                exposure to atmosphere dramatically accelerated the growth of some bacteria which grew
                                worse in gastrointestinal tract with few air. Probably coculture in an anaerobic
