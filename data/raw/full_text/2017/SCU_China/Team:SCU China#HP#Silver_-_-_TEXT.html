OVERVIEW
"Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work."
——————————————— Peter Carr, Director of Judging
      Our project this year originated from a real social issue in our life, and we dedicated to ensure that “Our projects are safe, responsible and good for the world.”
      In pursuit of that goal, Human Practice connects us with the society and maps our research to the real world.                                         Our Human Practices could be further divided into 3 Acts: Survey (about the real world scenario and interviews with experts), Meet-ups (communicating with other iGEMers), Engagement (science popularizing [sessions]). Next, we invite you to join us and learn more about how our work affects the world, and how the world affects our work.

Questionnaires
      This year, we conducted a random questionnaire and a non-random questionnaire to investigate the realities of the public’s and a particular population’s sleep status and acceptance degree of melatonin. According to the results of these questionnaires, we realized that the sleep problem has been a common problem in the modern society, and it’s high time to solve this problem and promote the public awareness of healthy sleep. In addition, melatonin could be a hit into the market with proper conduct propaganda, and the particular population who often worked the night shift may be our major potential customer. "learn more…"

      We interviewed a researcher, Dr.Zhang, who works in West China Sleep Medicine Center to do some research about melatonin and sleep, to confirm how much would melatonin help for our sleep. And he also gave us some advice on project design. In order to know the safety and the market value of melatonin, we sent an email to Mr.Lan, who works in Chongqing Food and Drug Administration.

CCiC
      To communicate with other iGEM teams and get more reliable resources, we attended 2017 Conference of China                                             iGEMer Community (CCiC) hosted by team “FAFU-China” in Fuzhou. In this meet-up, we knew what others had focused on,                                             what they had done and what they could do to help us.                                             On the other hand, we also provided them with some suggestions which might give them a hand. "learn more…"
