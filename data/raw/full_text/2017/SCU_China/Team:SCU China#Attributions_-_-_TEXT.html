      Sincere thanks to all those who                                 have helped us over this year, not                                 only for helping on the project, but also for experiencing an unforgettable journey                                 together. Here we describe what we have done by ourselves this year and what was done by                                 others in detail.
  SCU_China in 2017 iGEM
      We started to prepare for                                     2017 iGEM a few weeks after the 2016 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group                                     leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short                                     training lasting for almost one week in winter holiday with the help of our                                     instructors. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the                                     training. Several reserved projects were chosen and being considered carefully in                                     Spring semester. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several                                     times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project                                     frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as                                     previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.
     Details of our winter training will also be introduced                                     to you here.
     Winter training was held a few days after Fall                                     semester. In a training lasting for                                     one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related                                     to molecular biology and synthetic biology. Laboratory safety will also be                                     emphasized. Our primary PI Dr. Nianhui Zhang will lead students to do some basic                                     experiments. Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students                                     in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is                                     not obligated to reserved team members. Though our materials are not available to                                     all students in our college, people who are not in our reserved team but want to                                     participate the training is welcomed. Training material is totally available to                                     them, too. Students will be grouped before the training, including people who are                                     not in our reserved team. Brainstorms were held every night based on groups. On the                                     last day, we will hold project defense to show our primary ideas about project.
