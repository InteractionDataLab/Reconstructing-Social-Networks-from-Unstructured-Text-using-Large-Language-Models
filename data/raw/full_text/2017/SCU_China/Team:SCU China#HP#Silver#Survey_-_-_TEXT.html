01.  Questionnairs
      Our team has always                                         focused on solving the existing issue seen in the society, and we value our                                         connection with the vast public as well as the society. According to our shared                                         daily experience, nowadays many people have trouble with sleeping, one of the most                                         important and dominant, yet mysterious activity in our life. For the youth,                                         social                                         pressure brought by both work and family may lead to irregular sleeping time or                                         even                                         sleeping disorder, while many elders also suffer from difficulty in falling                                         asleep                                         or awakening easily – problems involving sleeping has become more and more                                         common.
      However, in order to determine more                                         precisely                                         the current sleeping conditions of the                                         public and to evaluate more objectively about the people’s knowledge on                                         melatonin –                                         the core of our project, surveys are to be made. Though there are surveys on                                         people’s sleeping quality made by CDC 1, The Sleep Council of the UK 2 and China                                         Sleep Research Association 3 etc., the data are always too generalized and from                                         a                                         few years ago; more importantly, there’s no existing research on the public’s                                         awareness and acceptance of melatonin.
      Therefore, our main focus in this survey is                                         to                                         answer 1) how is people’s sleeping                                         quality, 2) what are the common problems that stalls people from sleeping. For the                                         special groups that will go for night shifts, we also seek to know 3) frequency                                         of                                         their night shifts and the effect of night shifts on their sleep. To access the                                         practicality of our project, we also investigated 4) how people regulate their                                         sleep                                         and the acceptance, usage of sleeping pills and 5) how are the understanding and                                         acceptance of melatonin of both groups who have regular schedules and who have                                         night                                         shifts.
1.1 Methodology
      We choose                                         questionnaire                                         survey as our investigating method, because to know about subjective issues like                                         sleeping quality and mental state etc., the best way is to directly listen to                                         the                                         people and ask them about their feeling. In this survey, we designed two                                         different                                         questionnaires for different targeting groups: one is for the vast public with                                         normal day/night schedule, while the other is for the groups who are requested                                         to go for night shifts – from the first questionnaire we expect to know the general                                         situation, while through the second questionnaire we could learn more about the                                         living, sleeping and demand of the people with reversed night/light-rest/work                                         periods.
      Sleeping is obviously a universal activity;                                         so for the first questionnaire aiming at                                         the common individuals, we distributed the questionnaire via the Internet and                                         encouraged people to forward our questionnaire through the social network to                                         reach                                         as much population as possible – largely, we regard the respondents are chosen                                         by                                         random sampling. For the second questionnaire, we randomly choose the                                         individuals                                         from groups that would have night shifts as our interviewee, for instance the                                         servicemen who would go for night watch and the flight attendance as well as                                         doctors                                         and nurses who would work at night occasionally by their schedule. After careful                                         assessment, we regard our samples could represent the general condition and view                                         of                                         the public as well as those of the groups with night shifts.
1.2 Results
      For Questionnaire 1, 442 questionnaires are                                         retrieved and for Questionnaire 2, 77                                         questionnaires are retrieved (for gender, age and job distribution of the                                         respondents, see Supplementary Materials).

1.2.2 Problem in Sleeping

      Surprisingly, 93% of the respondents admit                                         that they have been troubled by                                         problems related to sleep. Among the commonly reported problems, “Find it                                         difficult to fall asleep”, “Be weaken up easily” and “Feel hot” rank the first                                         three, where the first two might resulted from shift or disorder in circadian                                         rhythm.

Fig 9. The subjective evaluation of night shifts’                                             effect on sleep
      Among the 77 respondents, about two thirds                                         of them would go on night shifts for                                         no less than 5 times every month on average (for age and job distribution, see                                         Supplementary Materials). What’s more, according to our interview, most of them                                         are not always work at night, which means they also have to always adjust their                                         sleeping time; this would easily lead to disordered circadian rhythm as well as                                         endocrine dyscrasia, where melatonin could be of great help on easing the                                         symptoms. As for the sleeping time after being on night shift, only about 30%                                         percent of people sleep more than 8 hours while 42% people sleep less than 5                                         hours, which shows the great impact on being on night shifts on sleep; moreover,                                         on a subjective evaluation of how being on night shifts affects their sleep, only 26% people think that night shifts affect their sleep a little or not at                                         all, which corresponds to the objective statistics.
1.2.3 Regulating Sleep and Sleeping Pills
Fig 10. Ways to regulate sleep

      People use a variety of methods to help them                                         falling asleep and sleep better,                                         while 15.64% of the respondents report that they use sleeping pills to assist                                         their sleep. Other methods might finally falling into the range of sheer                                         self-comfort. However, among the mostly used methods, approaches like “Watch TV”                                         and “Play on the phone” may disrupt sleep even more due to the shortwave light                                         the screens emit. Among the sleeping pill using individuals, only about one                                         third uses melatonin (age and job distribution could be find in the                                         Supplementary Material) while the others use traditional medicines.
1.2.4 Understanding and Acceptance of Melatonin
Fig 12. Ways to improve sleeping quality of the                                             groups with night shifts
      For the people who have night shifts, about                                         half of them choose to sleep more                                         after being on night shift to ease the influence. There are still many ones                                         choose to use diazepam, and in this survey only one person uses melatonin.
Understanding and Acceptance of Melatonin

Fig 14. Acceptance of melatonin of the people with                                             night shifts
      Not so surprisingly, over two third of the                                         people we investigated showed no                                         acknowledgement of melatonin, while 24% of the people have heard of melatonin                                         but not sure about its usage and only 8% know its curative effect. When asked                                         whether they will try melatonin, 50% of the people who go for night shifts state                                         that they don’t need medicine and 39% of them keep cautious and want to learn                                         more; distrust is also seen where 3% of the respondents regard melatonin is not                                         reliable. Only 8% percent of the night shift groups say that they would try                                         melatonin. Obviously, more toil must be committed to educate the people about                                         melatonin.
1.3 Conclusion & Discussion
      To determine more precisely the current                                         sleeping conditions and to evaluate more                                         objectively about the knowledge on melatonin of both the groups having normal                                         schedules and having night shifts, we conducted two questionnaire survey targeting the two groups, respectively, and we get a deeper understanding of our                                         questions.
      Considering the people’s sleeping quality,                                         the data apparently show that most                                         people do not meet the healthy sleep time standard (≥ 8 hours). Besides the                                         common sleep problems like going to bed too late or not having enough time to                                         sleep, people suffer from other problems that affect their sleep quality like                                         feeling difficult to fall asleep or easy to be waken up. The population in China                                         is large, so the absolute number of people who have trouble with sleeping is                                         enormous which makes this no trivial issue. As stated above in the Results                                         section, many dominating sleeping problems result from the disrupted circadian                                         clock, whose symptoms could be eased by taking exogenous melatonin.
      As for the awareness of sleeping, we regard                                         most of our respondents lack                                         sufficient knowledge, which is reflected by their ways of regulating sleep and                                         improving sleep quality – the methods are indeed traditional, but they have no                                         apparent effect and easily falls into the range of placebo. To sleep better,                                         know more about sleep first; science popularizing sessions and activities can                                         serve as very good ways to arouse public attention and improve public awareness.
      For the people who goes for night shifts,                                         such as servicemen, flight attendance                                         and medical staffs, most of our respondents go for more than 5 night shifts                                         every month on average and have a much shorter sleep when they go off duty;                                         their sleeping quality is more severely affected than the normal people, as                                         indicated by both the objective statistics and subjective evaluation. What’s                                         more, we also discovered that the older the more likely that one would go for                                         night shifts (see Supplementary Material); the adjusting capability of circadian                                         rhythm declines as aging, which enforced the negative effects of night                                         shifts.
      There are people who uses sleeping pills to                                         regulate their sleep, and most of                                         them uses traditional tablets like Barbital and Diazepam. The public showed                                         widespread ignorance on the new medicine of melatonin, and many are suspicious                                         about its effect. The people having night shifts accept melatonin more, and many                                         are willing to try it. This inspires us that we still have to publicize                                         melatonin more so more people could get known of its positive effects and                                         benefit from it.
      Though our survey would be more objective when conducted on a larger sample, we                                         still regard the data and results valid and could be used to guide our                                         project.

02  Consulting With Experts
2.1 Sleep Medical Center, West China Hospital
      Melatonin, the protagonist of our project,                                         turns out to be a mild and efficient medication in treatment of sleep disorder. But in what extant would melatonin                                         influence our sleep? As there are so many different claims about this question,                                         we decided to interview professors of West China sleeping center as an authority                                         to confirm the effects that melatonin has on sleep. The sleeping center once                                         carried on a project about developing a melatonin sustained release tablets.                                         Also, it has done lots of other researches on melatonin. Thus, we believed West                                         China sleeping center would give us the authoritative answer we want. With the                                         help of team “SCU-WestChina”, we got in touch with Professor Tang Xiangdong and                                         his postdoctor Doctor Zhang Ye from the sleeping center.
Fig. 1 We had a face to face conversation with Dr.                                             Zhang on efficacy of melatonin as well as our project at West China                                             hospital’s sleeping center.
      After we interviewed them about sleep                                         disorder treatment and our project design,                                         we improved our understanding about our project deeply.
Fig. 2 After our interview, we are greeted for Dr.                                             Zhang to share his rest time to talk with us.
      Firstly, we were more confident about the                                         potential use of melatonin as a common                                         medicine for sleep disorder. As Doctor Zhang mentioned, melatonin, with a short                                         half-life, is more appropriate for sleep disorder due to smaller 'hangover'                                         effects on the following morning. And previous studies indicate that patients                                         are unlikely to develop dependence and tolerance on melatonin. Doctor Zhang                                         emphasized that our project, using microorganism to produce melatonin in                                         intestine, is more economical compared with chemical method. So we were                                         convinced that our project is possible to generate economic benefits in the                                         future.
      Additionally, with the help of Doctor Zhang,                                         we found there were so many things                                         to do in order to optimize our project. For safety purposes, we were recommended                                         to use a safer bacterial strain in the final products. What’s more, Doctor Zhang                                         explained sleep associated neural circuits to us, which enlightened us to                                         consider the relationship of melatonin expression and sleep associated neural                                         circuits or other neural activities.

      Furthermore, we were honored to be invited                                         to the fourth China Sleep Research                                         Association Youth Academic Forum and Sichuan Medical Association Sixth Session                                         of Sleep Medicine academic conference. Lots of professors in Sichuan province                                         gave a presentation on their projects. Some of these projects illustrate how                                         melatonin worked in our sleeping process. We have learned a lot about most                                         recent melatonin research.  Attending the conference, we realized some of the                                         points we didn't consider before. We are supposed to adjust the rhythmic                                         expression in Escherichia to human's bio-clock.
      Thanks to advice from Professor Tang                                         Xiangdong and Doctor Zhang Ye, we completed                                         our project more excellently.

2.2 CFDA
      In order to learn more about the supervision standards of health-care products                                         as well as safety and potential market value of melatonin, we sent emails to                                         consult a staff member of China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).
      From this online interview, we have learnt that there are specific criterions                                         for different health products. The test always includes pesticide effect,                                         physicochemical properties and bacteria levels. Generally, products without high                                         purity have difficulties in passing the test, and melatonin in the market was                                         produced by chemical synthesis, whose major problem is that by-products produced                                         in chemical production and those catalysts are toxic. Thus, biosynthesis of                                         melatonin in our project will be of great practical application value. However,                                         the existing drugs made from bacteria are used to improve digest ability merely.                                         So it is uncertain whether our final products can appear on the market or not.                                         But we are inspired to consider a safer bacteria strain used in our project in                                         terms of present microbial products in the future.
      In addition, the staff member of CFDA mentioned that melatonin has a high pass                                         rate in the test, which convinced us of the potential usage of our expected                                         products. Also, we have learnt that people having special work often take                                         melatonin health products regularly. Hence, it is necessary to research and                                         develop a more efficient melatonin health product.
