                                    2017 iGEM a few weeks after the 2016 iGEM. Team leader, vice team leader and group
                                    leaders and reserved team members were determined at that time. We held a short
                                    training lasting for almost one week in winter holiday with the help of our
                                    instructors. Brainstorms were held to come up with our new project during the
                                    training. Several reserved projects were chosen and being considered carefully in
                                    Spring semester. During the Spring semester, we held project analysis for several
                                    times to learn from other teams. ACMA was successfully held as well. General project
                                    frame was determined in May with the help of our teachers, advisors, as well as
                                    previous iGEMers. Experiments were done from July to October.     Details of our winter training will also be introduced
                                    to you here.     Winter training was held a few days after Fall
                                    semester. In a training lasting for
                                    one week, teachers and speakers will present the basic ideas and knowledge related
                                    to molecular biology and synthetic biology. Laboratory safety will also be
                                    emphasized. Our primary PI Dr. Nianhui Zhang will lead students to do some basic
                                    experiments. Timetable of this year’s winter training is shown in figure 1. Students
                                    in winter training mainly are reserved team member selected before. The training is
                                    not obligated to reserved team members. Though our materials are not available to
                                    all students in our college, people who are not in our reserved team but want to
                                    participate the training is welcomed. Training material is totally available to
                                    them, too. Students will be grouped before the training, including people who are
                                    not in our reserved team. Brainstorms were held every night based on groups. On the
                                    last day, we will hold project defense to show our primary ideas about project.
