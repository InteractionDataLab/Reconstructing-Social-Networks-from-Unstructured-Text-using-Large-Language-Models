Improvement
       We have improved the                                 function of two existing part this year.
      One is BBa_I13521 , whose RBS was be                                 submitted by the designed RBS. The new parts                                 ( BBa_K2276007 , BBa_K2276008 , especially BBa_K2276010 ) improved the                                 translation rate of                                 the original part.so that the properties of BBa_I13521 as a reporter device could be improved with higher or slower sensitivity.
       Modeling details about it in our wiki , Experimental details about it in our wiki .
    The other is BBa_E2050 , which only contains a                                 CDS of mOrange. In order to make it                                 expressed in E.coli, we added pTetR promotor( BBa_R0040 ), RBS( BBa_B0034 ) and double                                 terminators( BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012 ) to it, constructing a                                 new reporter part                                 ( BBa_K2276009 ).
