Collaborations
      Nowadays, collaboration between                                 researchers plays a critical role in the process of making important breakthroughs in                                 scientific fields. It is more and more difficult to finish a research project by                                 individual group of researchers. As for us, helps from other iGEM teams were vital to                                 our project improvement, experiments and human practices. In the other hand, we tried                                 our best to gave support to those iGEMers in need as well.                                 This year, there are totally 5 iGEM teams, SCU-WestChina, Peking, SiCAU-China,                                 TMMU_China and Purdue collaborated with SCU_China, either through one directional help                                 or mutual collaboration between each other. The formats of our collaboration are                                 variable. The details of our collaboration are listed below:
01.  SCU-WestChina
      As two teams from one                                     university, we collaborated with Team SCU-WestChina closely and in depth in                                     different aspects such as team building, project design, experiment and human                                     practice etc.
Registration
      SCU-WestChina is the newly-formed and the second                                     team in Sichuan University, and                                     with our help they got the “Multiple Team Discount” when registered.
Project Desgin
RiboJ
      SCU-WestChina is the newly-formed and the second                                     team in Sichuan University, and                                     with our help they got the “Multiple Team Discount” when registered.
Experiments
Materials
      Because SCU-WestChina didn’t have the 96-well                                     plate with black background for fluorescence measurement and trypsin for artificial                                     intestine fluid, which we happened to have some surplus, thus we provided them with                                     these materials for experiment.
Microplate Reader
      Because of regulations of microplate readers in                                     College of Life Sciences, SCU, we cannot do continuous measurement in our                                     laboratory. We asked SCU-WestChina for help and they found us a reader which could                                     do continuous measurement in State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy (SKLB), SCU and we                                     finished our measurement there.                                     e. We shared the laboratory with SCU-WestChina when SKLB experienced sudden power                                     failure.
RED
      SCU-WestChina generously gave us the verified                                     pKD46 plasmid for RED.
Human Practices
Sleep Medicine Center, West China Hospital
      This year, our project is closely related to                                     melatonin and sleep; to obtain the real clinic data and the views from the doctors,                                     we hoped to contact with the doctors from Center of Sleep Disorder in West China                                     Hospital, SCU. Considering that the members of SCU-WestChina were more familiar with                                     the doctors than us, we asked for help and they reached the doctors first and got                                     the contact information for us, so that we could complete the following work like                                     interview etc.
iSWU 2017
      We attended the iSWU 2017 conference held by                                     SCU-WestChina, and we discussed about each other’s project and gave suggestions on                                     possible manipulation and optimization of the projects.
ACMA 2017
      Team SCU-WestChina attended ACMA 2017 held by                                     us. In this competition, they assist                                     us doing some work. During the Academic Salon, the leader of SCU-WestChina presented                                     the projects from Vilnius-Lithuania 2016 and Groningen 2012 and answered questions                                     from the candidates. He also shared the techniques could be used in project                                     construction and design. In the pre-thesis defense, he also served as one of the                                     judges – he graded, commented and questioned.
Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
      We collaborated with Team SCU-WestChina,                                     TMMU-China and UESTC-China and completed                                     the themed exhibition on “Transgene and Human Health” held by Chengdu Library. More                                     in the library exhibition part in Human Practice.
02.   Peking
      At the end of August, we discovered that the                                     plasmid pLPT107 couldn’t be transformed                                     into our own knockout strain. Then, we asked Team Peking, whose project was also                                     related to repressilator, for help. Team Peking immediately shared the knockout                                     strain they acquired from the authors with us. What’s more, we had intense and deep                                     discussions on the usage and verification of the strain.
03.   SiCAU-China
a.Parts in 2016 DNA distribution
      Before the iSWU meet-up, team “SiCAU-China”,                                     a new iGEM team, contacted with us for some parts in 2016 DNA distribution to                                     prepare for their preliminary experiments. And we took those plasmids to them at the                                     meetup.
b.LUDOX
      Caused by our carelessness, we put the LUDOX                                     in the -20 degrees centigrade as we did last year, leading to all of LUDOX in 2017                                     kit precipitating. However, we wanted to participate in this year’s InterLab study,                                     which should use LUDOX as materials. Thus, we sought help in the Wechat group of                                     “iSWU”; thankfully, team “SiCAU-China” provided us with LUDOX in their measurement                                     kit immediately, which is vital for us to finish our InterLab study.
04.   TMMU-China
      The suggestions from the instructors of                                     TMMU-China made us realize that our initial design of rabies vaccine through mouth                                     would face great uncertainty and difficulty, and drove us to choose “Rhythmic                                     Production of Melatonin in E.coli” as our final project.
05.   Purdue
a. Project Discussion
      We had video chat with team “Purdue” to                                     introduce our respective projects. In this video chat, their real condition                                     simulation inspired us to do some experiments to simulate growth conditions in the                                     environment of gut.
b. Wiki Design
      We gave some suggestions for wiki design to                                     them.
