01  Background
      Repressilator is the                                     necessary                                     and basic part of our project, which ‘grant’ the four melatonin-synthetic enzymes                                     (actually COMT) periodically expression pattern.
      Repressilator was first construct by Michael B.                                     Elowitz & Stanislas Leibler in 2000. As                                     a well-characterized synthetic circuit, it is designed to help understand naturally                                     occurring oscillating networks and remarkably precise and robust dynamics shown in                                     many                                     biological systems, for example, the circadian clock.                                     Just like the name ‘repressilator’ indicate, the circuit actually is built from the                                     combination of (three) transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any                                     natural biological clock, they inhibit mutually to achieve an oscillating pattern,                                     (A B                                     C A); in other words, each of the downstream gene is controlled by the previous                                     repressors. The protein half life of the repressors and the induction threshold of                                     the                                     promoter mainly contribute to the oscillating pattern and period.
      In the original ones the reporter is built in                                     another plasmid and co-transform into the                                     E.coli. pSC101 is choosed for the backbone because of its low replicating number. In                                     2016 researchers do some modification work for the both plasmid and E.coli starin.                                     Reporters are inserted into the repressilator plasmid and fuction simutanously as                                     trition sponge because triple reporters have exactly the same promoters of                                     repressors                                     elongating the period of reaching induction threshold for the repressors and                                     diluting                                     repressor effective concentration referring to the number of proteins binding with                                     the                                     operator sequence in the promoter.(Fig1)
Figure1. (a) Original repressilator and (b)optimised                                         pLPT107                                         .
      To some extent, original repressilator can                                     exhibit a                                     wide range of dynamical features                                     but often with lower accuracy, especially obvious unsynchrony and phase drift. In                                     2016,                                     researchers modified the original one and rebuilt a triple reporter repressilator                                     without repressor degradation (E.coli proteaseΔclpXP strains) and with titration                                     sponge.                                     It was reported that cells could display macroscopic, population-scale oscillations                                     and                                     shew a typical 14 generation cyclic period without cell–cell communication. In other                                     words they can synchronize automatically in a liquid culture and maintain it after                                     proper (1mM) iPTG induction, which provides a theoretically feasible design to                                     combine the oscillating network with melatonin synthesis via TetR controlled promoter of key                                     enzyme COMT. Thus, in this part, we design a lot of experiments to verify the                                     repressilator basic properties in different conditions and try to acquire a more                                     precise                                     and regular oscillating pattern as the origin of the periodic signal.

2.1 Repressilator basic properties and optimization
     We bought well-construct                                     commercialized plasmid pLPT107 (as reported in the paper) (Fig1)and transformed it                                     into                                     E.coli MC4100 and DHL708ΔclpXP strain (received from team “Peking”, more details                                     about                                     knock-out are listed at the end) (both are LacI knocked out) respectively to test                                     the                                     function of protease for oscillating period and phase drift, because protease                                     knocking-out may have some potential influence on the enzyme activity and kinetics                                     of                                     whole four-enzyme system due to the protein half-life changes and it is better not                                     to                                     use this strain in enzyme expression if not necessary. The real-time fluorescence                                     intensity of all three reporters CFP (400/476nm) YFP(480/530nm) RFP(590/630nm) is                                     measured by 37℃ culturing the strains in 96-well plate in plate reader. And every                                     90mins                                     bacteria is diluted to OD0.1-0.2 to keep in early exponential phase. We calculate                                     the                                     fluorescence intensity/OD600 in the figure to represent the fluorescence protein                                     concentration in a single unit such as one E.coli cell. And our results shows that                                     strains obey a 120min long oscillating period, whileΔclpXP strain exhibits a more                                     regular oscillating pattern than its counterpart, whereas it is quite confused that                                     the                                     period is such short and DHL708ΔclpXP only differ with MC4100 in amplitude not in                                     the                                     period length which is inconsistent with the paper (Fig 2). However DHL708 exhibits                                     colony ring-structure comparing to MC4100 (Fig3), and all indicts that protease                                     knocked-out strain is necessary for following experiments to achieve a much more                                     regular                                     cyclic pattern.

The                                     major difference between protease clpXP knout-out and normal MC4100 is MC4100                                     shows                                     a higher and more irregular oscillating amplitude especially at the                                     begin(0-200min)                                     and at the end (1500-1675min). (c), and for RFP both strains oscillates in a                                     similar                                     low level 100-300 A.U./OD 1300mins before, but after 1300min the fluorescence                                     intensity of MC4100 increase obviously and even reaches 5000 A.U./OD in the                                     following 300min which cannot be illustrated reasonably.

The                                         images are acquired using Leica microscopy and solid culture medium are                                         conditioned                                         on the slides for bacterial colony incubation and image acquisition.
      To optimize the oscillating period, we try to                                     add                                     additive iPTG in the measuring process                                     to urge the cell synchronize under the outer ‘pressure’. And different concentration                                     of                                     iPTG is added into the dilution M9 medium to achieve ultimate 100/250/500/1000μM. We                                     find that additive iPTG could help to synchronize in a more robust way by amplify                                     the                                     oscillating amplitude, in other word the fluorescence intensity changes more                                     rapidly.Another finding is that with the iPTG concentration increase, the induction effect increase firstly and then decrease and 500uM iPTG is the best.                                      (Fig 4)

      Generally, the periods of synthetic circuits                                     depend                                     on so many different parameters that                                     change with conditions, as conditions change, the plasmid copy numbers, RNA                                     degradation,                                     gene expression, and cell volume change in non-trivial ways, making it robust                                     relative                                     to internal physiological time scales such as the generation times. So we utilized                                     different culture conditions (measured by additive LB ratio-5% 10% 20% 40%, higher                                     ratio                                     means richer nutrition) to test whether cyclic period will change with the                                     increase/decrease of the nutrition and on the other hand try to get a longer                                     oscillating                                     period. Because we do hope this period could be adjusted closer to human circadian                                     clock                                     (12 hours) so we can express melatonin in this pattern to imitate the natural                                     process.                                     (Fig 5) MC4100 and DHL708ΔclpXP continuously incubate in 37 ℃ plate reader in                                     different M9 culture medium and RFP fluorescence is measured in these conditions. Oscillating                                     pattern do not exhibit significant difference among various M9 medium for                                     DHL708ΔclpXP,                                     which indicts that culture conditions, especially nutrition, have no obvious                                     influence                                     on oscillation. And it is possible for us to rhythmic express our melatonin synthase                                     in                                     the E.coli and keep a regular period.

Influence of nutrition for oscillation. a b,                                         MC4100                                         and DHL708ΔclpXP continuously incubate in 37 ℃ plate reader in different M9                                         culture                                         medium (5% 10% 20% 40% LB additive) and RFP fluorescence is measured in these                                         conditions. As additive LB ratio increase, MC4100 exhibits higher and higher                                         fluorescence intensity per OD600 whereas DHL708ΔclpXP keep in a stable state and                                         appear no significant differences among each group.
      Next, in order to investigate whether the                                     strains or                                     bacteria have possibility to                                     colonize into the gut environment and change their oscillating period, artificial                                     intestinal fluid (formula in method) was applied to substitute the normal culture                                     medium                                     and different ratio of LB was added to mimic the various nutrition state for a                                     person in                                     a day (Empty to Full).As Fig 6a indicts both MC4100 and DHL708 are able to colonize                                     stably in the artificial intestinal fluid and Fig6b suggests that both strains can                                     maintain their oscillating period in artificial intestinal fluid while DHL708ΔclpXP                                     could keep a much better regularity in various nutritional intestinal fluid                                     simultaneously.

      The OD of all experimental groups increase                                     exclusively relative to different culture                                     conditions, as indicts, absolute LB and intestinal fluid represent the fastest and                                     slowest growth rate respectively and DHL708ΔclpXP cells generally possess a slower                                     growth rate referring to its counterparts during the whole measurement. b, both                                     strains                                     can maintain their oscillating period in artificial intestinal fluid while                                     DHL708ΔclpXP                                     could keep a much better regularity in various nutritional intestinal fluid                                     simultaneously. On the other perspective, the nutrition of the fluid nearly exhibit                                     no                                     obvious impact on oscillation, no matter period and pattern.
2.2 Protease knock-out for MC4100 and DHL708ΔclpXP strain
      ClpXP protein is a protease which can recognize                                     ssrA                                     tag, a degradation tag, and target the attached protein for destruction, belonging to the heat shock protein Hsp100                                     family.
      As the first repressilator reported in 2000,                                     ssrA tag is added to repressors in                                     repressilator in order to bring the effective repressor protein lifetimes to that of                                     mRNA.
      However, the research in 2016 showed that the                                     ssrA                                     tag induced ‘retroactivity’ effects                                     on oscillations owing to competition for shared proteases, and removing this                                     interference created very regular oscillations, with longer periods.
      Hence we decide to knock out the clpXP to                                     create                                     a                                     more regular oscillation with                                     longer periods.
      Because the pKD3 plasmid we have was wrong, we                                     use                                     one part of Red recombination system.                                     The biggest difference between our method and the traditional method is that our PCR                                     production doesn’t have FRT site so we don’t need to transform the pCP20 plasmid                                     into                                     the bacterial to remove the reporter gene. Our RED recombination system utilize the                                     pKD46 plasmid to express three proteins: Exo can produce 3’-overhang, Bet can induce                                     two                                     single strand DNA molecule becoming double strand DNA and Gam can inhibit the                                     function                                     of RecBCD protein. The pKD46 plasmid is then transformed into E.coli, with these                                     three                                     proteins expressing under the induction of L-Arabinose. Then the PCR production of                                     reporter gene, Kanamycin resistance gene, which is flanked by two 57bp homologous                                     arm of                                     clpXP, is transformed into the bacteria expressiong Exo, Bet and Gam by                                     electroporation,                                     leading to the substitution of Kanamycin resistance gene for clpXP. Finally, the                                     pKD46                                     plasmid will be lost by high temperature culture, and the ΔclpXP E.coli is screened                                     by                                     Kanamycin.(Fig 7)
Fig.7 The schematic diagram of clpXP knock-out process.
      Because our reporter gene is Kanamycin                                     resistance                                     gene, the bacteria is plated on the                                     solid medium contained Kanamycin. The number of colonies between experimental group                                     is                                     much larger than that of the control group, which is E.coli with pKD46 without the                                     insert bringing in the homology arms. The experimental group is cultured in liquid                                     media and then used as template of PCR to confirm the recombination colonies. And then                                     colony                                     PCR is used to confirm the result of recombination. The PCR products from                                     recombination                                     colonies are below 2kb, while the products from wild type is about 2kb. Then we                                     optimized the PCR reaction and sequenced the product from recombination colonies,                                     whose                                     result indicts that we have successfully knocked out the clpXP gene.

a,The electrophoresis                                     result of PCR production of adding homologous arm to K resistance gene. The result                                     of PCR was accordance with the anticipated objective strap size (1157bp).
b, The                                     result of single bacteria colony PCR after optimization. It’s clear that the length                                     of PCR production is less than 2kb.
c, The result of single bacteria colony PCR                                     after                                     optimization. It’s clear that the length of PCR production is less than 2kb.
d,                                     The                                     result of single bacteria colony PCR. The 12 lane is negative control which                                     undergoes the PCR without template. The 13 lane is positive control using the wild                                     type bacteria as template.
e, The recombination colony is obviously lower than                                     2000bp and has non-specific band at 1000bp. The wild type’s specific band is at                                     2000bp and the non-specific band is at 700bp.
      We have did a lot of experiments to knock out                                     the clpXP, and However, the ΔclpXP MC4100                                     stain that has been knocked out by ourselves still has ampicillin resistance, which                                     may                                     be caused by partial remaining of pKD46. Therefore, the plasmid pLPT107 with                                     ampicillin                                     resistance gene cannot be transformed into the ΔclpXP MC4100 stain efficiently;                                     thus, we                                     turn to team "Peking" for help immediately. Great acknowledgement for they sending                                     their                                     ΔclpXP strain (from author 2) to us and sharing their experience. We use the primer                                     designed in the paper to confirm protease is well knocked out.
