                                    are complex dynamic systems, and they can describe the interaction of gene
                                    expression of living cells. When designing novel system of wanted function, the
                                    intrinsic stabilization and regulation of kinetics activity could determine the
                                    outcome of the design, which highlight the crucial role of mathematical and physical
                                    modelling. Many works have been done to analyze the behavior of synthetic
                                    oscillators. The most well-known synthetic oscillator is the repressilator, which
                                    was the first one to be achieved with experiment by Elowitz&amp;Leibler in 2000[7].
                                    Their realized synthetic oscillation in one cell. In 2016, Potvin-Trottier and his
                                    coworker successfully measured the repressilator functioning features in a cluster
                                    of cells[16]. However, in order to enhance the synchronization in a population of
                                    cells, in our project, we coupled quorum sensing system with repressilator to
                                    synchronize repressilators oscillation pattern. In addition, to measure the time to
                                    reach quasi-steady-state, we included the delay time τ into the equations since time
                                    delays are omnipresent in actual complex systems[5][13][15]. The equations that we
                                    use to describe this behavior of the system are ordinary differential equations
                                    (ODE) and delay differential equations (DDE). At last, the model is shown below.

                                        reason is that it actually requires quite a lot of steps to produce a functional

                                        quorum sensing becomes less effective. The phase lag of different cells will not
                                        decrease like the original equations in chapter 1.4, and fluctuation of
                                        concentration is everywhere. The phase lag brought by delay time will hamper the
                                        synchronization because the cell only feels the extracellular AI a moment ago.
                                        Although the result is less satisfying, but our new equations (1.18) is at least
                                        closer to the real situation. On the other hand, if we make the period of

                                        already got a basic image of the behavior of the repressilator. Aiming to make
                                        our project more reliable, we need to control the period of oscillation. In our
                                        project, we intend to make the production of Melatonin follow people’s
                                        biological clock. Nevertheless, according to the results in chapter 1.6, the
                                        period with β=1.0 is around 12 times mRNA lifetime, which yields around 1 hour
                                        if we set mRNA lifetime equals to 5 minutes. Unfortunately, this is still hard
                                        to reach our design. Therefore, we are going to analyze the controlling
                                        parameters of period. Apparently, β is the marked parameter. The other
                                        parameters like α₀, n, κ andη mainly affect the expressing strength
                                        (concentration of peak value), while β can change the period of proteins. So, we

                                            longer with the decrease of β. However, longer period comes along with
                                            unsteadiness. We can see that if we set β&lt;0.2, the system won’t even
                                            oscillates (some of the cell). We can set β<SUB>min<SUB>=0.2 as the critical value.
                                            Below β<SUB>min<SUB>, where mRNA decay rate is 5 times as much as the protein decay
                                            rate, we’d better avoid that if we want our Melatonin produce steadily.
                                            Approximately, we can make our mRNA decay a little bit faster like 2 to 4
                                            times will be good. The period will increase roughly from one hour to 1.5
                                            hours and 3 hours. Objectively speaking, this is still not up to standard.
                                            But at least we can figure out other ways to increase mRNA lifetime. If we
                                            can lengthen the mRNA lifetime to 4 times as much as the original one, we

                                            average protein CI in every cell. The results are in Fig.14.

                                            in Fig.16. There are three groups of figures. The left images are
                                            arrayplots. Each pixel represents a cell and the intensity of the
                                            fluorescence or concentration of Melatonin is represented as green color.
                                            The Right images are the average intensity or concentration of Melatonin.

                                            Fig.16. The result of the simulation. (a) represents Q=0.6, β=1 with
                                            no-delay quorum sensing. We can see that it is a good result because almost
                                            all the cells are oscillating at the same time. The average intensity is
                                            also quite like a single situation we discussed before. (b) represents
                                            Q=0.8, β=0.5 with delayed-quorum sensing. The peak value decreased a lot,
                                            but we still can see small oscillation from the right image. (c) represents
                                            Q=0.8, β=0.35 with delayed quorum sensing. It seems to be a poor result
                                            since there are barely no synchronization and they are oscillating to the
                                            peak value one another. The average intensity will be like a random noise.
                                            In fact, some of our experiments also have similar result like (c), where
                                            the data we get seems to be a random noise.

                                </DIV><DIV><P class="scu_content_p">      So far, our modeling shows that with high Q
                                        value (means high cell density for quorum sensing) the concentration of the
                                        target protein or Melatonin will oscillate even there is fluctuation and time
                                        delay to the system. To be honest, it’s hard to judge the reliability of the
                                        modeling of repressilator, and some of the parameters we used may not be that
                                        accurate due to the fluctuations of the cells’ physical property. Biology system
                                        is complex, and we still have much room to improve our model like considering
                                        the concentration impact of cell division[1][8] or introducing stochastic
                                        differential equations[5]. However, we do have the confidence that our modeling
                                        can be an effective and reasonable reference to design our project or similar
                                        projects.
