Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli
SCU_China
      Nowadays, insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders are increasingly plaguing                                     individuals' daily life. The circadian rhythm in human is predominantly under the                                     regulation of melatonin, a hormone produced by pineal gland periodically in                                     accordance with day-and-night photoperiod. This year we wanted to use engineered E.coli to mimic this process in human as a promising dosing machine. We proposed to construct the melatonin biosynthesis pathway in E.coli to produce melatonin, and                                     simultaneously couple this process with optimized repressilator, a synthetic genetic                                     oscillator with higher precision and stability, to magnify the function of repressilator and render melatonin production resemble mammalian periodicity in E.coli.
1. Our human practices were integrated to the whole process, which made us                                         complete                                         the project better.
2. We improved two previous part BBa_I13521 and BBa_E2050 and our BioBrick work                                         well                                         in lab condition.
3. Our experimental design based on modelling results, such as the optimal                                         proportioning of synthetase.
4. Engineered E.coli is cultured with artificial gastrointestinal juices and gut                                         flora to validate the substantial integration and survival condition based on                                         the                                         consideration for better safety and higher efficiency.
1. There are 4 new BioBrick parts in our project as follow, BBa_K2276001,                                         BBa_K2276003, BBa_K2276004 and BBa_K2206005.
2. We collaborated with SCU-WestChina and SiCAU-China in experiments and human                                         practice, received key assists from Peking University and offered wiki design                                         suggestions to team Purdue.
3. We consulted experts of China Food and Drug Administration and West China                                         Sleeping Centre for both experimental designs and safety problems. Also, we                                         collected and analyzed convincing datas from our survey.
1. We constructed a team successfully, sharing not only academic knowledge but                                         also                                         life experiences with each other.
2.We received many kindly help from surroundings, including our college,                                         instructor, experts in various fields, friendly fraternal teams and so on.We                                         have clearly acknowledged their works.
3. We managed to meet all the Deliverables standards.
4. We participated in the Interlab Measurement Study.
