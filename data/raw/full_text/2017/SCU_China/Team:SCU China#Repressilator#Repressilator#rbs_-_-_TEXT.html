RBS Modification
01 Design
      Because we want to mimic the process of melatonin                                 production in human, we need to                                 elongate the period cycle of repressilator. According to the modeling results of                                 repressilator, faster translation is helpful to the period elongation; thus, a strong                                 ribosome binding site may be required. Then, we scanned the iGEM registry, finding that                                 we only have a small number of ribosome binding sites whose strengths have been                                 determined. Therefore, we decided to modify an existing RBS in iGEM registry by                                 ourselves to obtain a series of stronger ribosome binding sites.
      Random mutation of RBS will generate a huge library,                                 which will increase our workload                                 grandly with numbers of useless mutations. Thus, we turned to a bioinformatics method to                                 predict the sequence of a synthetic RBS with a target translation initiation rate on a                                 proportional scale. We designed our RBS via the modeling in the website                                 (https://salislab.net/software/doForwardRBS)1, which was based on the theory that build                                 on previous work that characterized the free energies of key molecular interactions                                 involved in translation initiation and on measurements of the sequence-dependent                                 energetic changes that occur during RNA folding and hybridization.1
      According to the modeling results of RBS                                 modification, we chose three designed RBS,                                 whose translation rate is predicted to be stronger than the original part: BBa_B0034.                                 The existing Part (BBa_I13521) is a reporter device constitute of TetR repressible                                 promoter (BBa_R0040), RBS (BBa_B0034), mRFP1 (BBa_E1010) and double terminator                                 (BBa_B0015). In our project, we managed to alternate the RBS region with our designed                                 RBS and to construct new part named Part:BBa_K2276007,Part:BBa_K2276008,                                 Part:BBa_K2276010 separately.
02 Results
      According to the mathematical modeling result of RBS                                 prediction by the RBS Calculator,                                 the predicted translation initiation rate of BBa_B0034 was 2297.59au. And we chose three                                 designed RBS，which was predicted to be 5、10、50 times stronger than B0034，and was                                 separately designated as P1, P2,P3.

Table 1. Table of designed synthetic RBS. “Relative                                     prediction strength” was the the ratio of the predicted translation initiation rate                                     the synthetic sequence to the predicted translation initiation rate BBa_B0034.
      Then, we constructed the plasmid containing pTet,                                 synthetic RBS, CDS of mRFP and double                                 terminator. (Fig.1) The only difference between the different constructed plasmids and                                 the pSB1C3-BBa_I13521 plasmid is RBS.(Fig.2) And these plasmids were characterized via                                 sequencing.

      Next, we measured the fluorescence intensity and the absorption the absorption value in OD600nm of these cultures with different plasmids according to the following methods:
      1. Streaked the plate with Bacterial Glycerol containing the constructed plasmid.
      2. Picked single clones from the plate and incubate overnight
      3. 12ml tubes containing 1ml liquid LB was inoculated with the overnight cultures using                                 a 1:100 dilution.
      4. Tested the fluoresce strength every 2 hours after inoculation sampled from different                                 tubes via plate reader.
      We can see that those strains have similar growth pattern，which indicated that the                                 fluorescence discrepancy had nothing to do with the quantity of the bacteria and the                                 growth conditions. (Fig.3)

      And the fluorecent measurement results showed that synthetic RBS P1 and P3 were obviously strong than RBS BBa_B0034. (Fig.4) In addition, we calculated the relative RBS strength via dividing (fluorescence intensity/ OD 600) by (fluorescence intensity of B0034). And this result further illustrated that the synthetic RBS (P1 and P3), especially P3, had obviously higher RBS strength than B0034; that is, the function of the original part (BBa_I13521) was indeed improved by us. (Fig.5)The drop at 16hours of P3 strain may result from the self-quenching which will happen when the concentration is too high. The cause may be the overlap of the emission spectrum and the absorb spectrum or the interaction between stimulated molecule. (Fig.4)(Fig.5)
      However, the experimental results of synthetic RBS P2 was not consistent with the prediction results; that is, the synthetic RBS P2 was weaken than the original RBS. In addition, the relative strength of these three synthetic RBS were less than the prediction results (Fig.5). Nevertheless, the qualitative results was consistent between RBS prediction results and experimental results in most cases. Thus, the results convinced us that the design method was reliable so that we can anticipate if we apply the method in our project, and we could increase the translation rate of interested protein and elongate the periodic cycle.
