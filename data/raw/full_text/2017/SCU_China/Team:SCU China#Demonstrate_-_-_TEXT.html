      During the communication                                 with team “Purdue”, we knew that they prepare to do an in vitro colonization assay to                                 see if their genetically modified E. coli could survive in the target place. Inspired by                                 their thought, we also designed a series of in vitro experiments in order to investigate                                 if our constructed bacteria could survive in gastrointestinal tract.
01  Materials
      Two parts of experiments were                                 designed. One of them is to                                 investigate if our genetically modified E. coli could adapt the physical environment of                                 gastrointestinal tract. We cultured the bacteria in artificial gastral juice and                                 intestinal juice, plotted the growth curve and compared with strains cultured in LB.                                 Another part is to test if our bacteria had the ability to compete with the native                                 microbiota in gastrointestinal tract. Based on such an idea, we obtain the feces of mice                                 from College of Pharmacy in our university and coculture them under different                                 conditions. Competent cells of MC4100 were made based on TSS method and transformed by                                 KCM transformation method (see notebook in detail).
      Main materials used in these experiments are shown                                 in Table 1. Related equipment is                                 similar to InterLab study and is not shown here, with acidimeter (LEICI PHSJ-3F) and                                 balance being the additional ones.

2.1 Growth in mimic physical environment
      Firstly, we prepared                                 competent cells of MC4100 based on TSS                                 method and transformed competent cells with plasmid bearing BBa_J04450 by KCM                                 transformation method.
      Artificial gastral juice and intestinal juice were                                 prepared according to the literature                                 (Table 2). Due to our constructions were in different strains, we tested the growth                                 condition of them respectively. mRFP (BBa_J04450) was used as reporter.
      We first transformed the competent DH5 alpha and                                 MC4100 with plasmid provided in                                 Competent Cell Kit, cultivated them under 37 degrees centigrade overnight. Then single                                 colonies were picked based on colony color. Liquid culture was made and incubated                                 overnight. After incubation for about 12~16h, culture was sampled and original OD600 was                                 measured. Then culture was diluted until OD600 = 0.02, which relied on calculation excel                                 of InterLab measurement offered on official website. 1mL Diluted culture was allocated                                 into a 10mL tube mixed with 1mL artificial gastral juice or intestinal juice. Nine                                 identical tubes were prepared to do the test at an interval of 3 hours from time 0 to                                 time 24 hours. Three biological replicates were made and growth curves were plotted                                 after measurement. A control group cultivated in 2mL LB was manipulated in the same way.                                 Corresponding concentration of Chloromycetin was premixed in the culture medium.
Figure 1. Growth curve in 2mL LB / 10mL Tube                                     Error bars were plotted based on three biological replicants.
Figure 2. Growth Curve in 1ml AG +1ml LB / 10ml Tube                                     AG is short for artificial gastral juice. Error bars were plotted based on three                                     biological replicants.
Figure 3. Growth Curve in 1ml AI +1ml LB / 10ml Tube                                     AI is short for artificial intestinal juice. Error bars were plotted based on three                                     biological replicants.
      According to our results, strain MC4100 grows                                 relatively better than DH5 alpha in pure LB. Compared with culture in pure LB, it is                                 easy to see that the growth of constructed strain will be influenced in either                                 artificial gastral juice or artificial intestinal juice. We can also get the conclusion                                 that MC4100 is more sensitive to artificial gastral juicy rather than intestinal juice,                                 probably suggesting its vulnerability to acidic environment. In general, our data shows                                 that the constructed bacteria can survive in an environment mimicking gastrointestinal                                 tract to some extent, though their growth will be affected.
2.2 Coculture with microbiota in mice feces
      Feces of mice were obtained from College of Pharmacy                                 with the help                                 of Qian Jiang (see attribution). 0.25g feces were dissolved in 2mL LB medium with no                                 antibiotic and cultured overnight. Strains mentioned before were cultured with                                 corresponding antibiotics. After incubating for about 14h, Feces cultures were then                                 filtered by normal filter paper (not filters with diameter equaling to 0.2 micron) to                                 get supernatant. OD600 of Supernatant as well as constructed strain cultures were                                 measured later. Based on measurement result, cultures were diluted to OD600 = 0.02                                 according to calculation excel provided on official website. Supernatant and bacteria                                 culture were than mixed in various ratio. Mixtures were cultured in either artificial                                 gastral juice or intestinal juice overnight. Then we did gradient dilution to the                                 culture and spread them on plates with no antibiotic. Plates were incubated under 37                                 degrees centigrade and observed after 2 days.

Coculture in artificial intestinal juice                                     Vertical coordinate shows the ratio of constructed strains to feces microbiota.                                     Horizontal coordinate shows the dilution gradient of culture.                                     Left panel: DH5 alpha, right panel: MC4100
Figure 5. Coculture in artificial intestinal juice                                     Vertical coordinate shows the ratio of constructed strains to feces microbiota.                                     Horizontal coordinate shows the dilution gradient of culture.                                     Left panel: DH5 alpha, right panel: MC4100
      We sadly found that except the                                 positive control (ratio 1:0 in figure 4, 5), none of experimental plate became even                                 reddish, not to say become as red as positive control after incubation for 2 days. Maybe                                 exposure to atmosphere dramatically accelerated the growth of some bacteria which grew                                 worse in gastrointestinal tract with few air. Probably coculture in an anaerobic                                 environment may provide different result.
