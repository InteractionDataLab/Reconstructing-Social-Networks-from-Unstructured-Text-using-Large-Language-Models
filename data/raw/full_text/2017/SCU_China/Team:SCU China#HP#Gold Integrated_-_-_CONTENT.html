                                    authorities as well as collaborating with other iGEM teams.      We initiated <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCU_China/HP/Silver/Survey#questionnairs">a field survey </A>on the sleeping
                                    quality and solutions Human Practice-Survey-Questionnairs to sleeping issues on the
                                    streets and via the Web. The questionnaire used in the survey contains questions
                                    considering sleeping quality of both groups having regular timetable and working at
                                    night, respectively, and the questions on solving sleeping problems and views on
                                    using medicine to improve sleeping quality. The result shows that a large portion of
                                    interviewees had sleeping problems, some of which suffered from severe symptoms;
                                    however, few figured out a way to tackle with the issues. Meanwhile, when it comes
                                    to the medicine, basic acknowledgement of traditional benzodiazepines medicines was
                                    observed, but seldom do people know about the medicine of melatonin.      To conclude, according to the survey, we regard
                                    it
                                    very meaningful and prospective
                                    to employ the synthetic biology approaches to present new solutions to the issues
                                    considering sleeping. With this knowledge as assurance, we began our design on the
                                    project tackling sleeping problems.      While we find the project on melatonin more
                                    interesting and promising, the<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCU_China/HP/Silver/Meetup#iSWU"> iSWU
                                        conference </A>led us to our final
                                    decision. iSWU is the organization consisting of all the iGEM team in the southwest
                                    of China, providing us the platform to share with each other our projects and
                                    thoughts on synthetic biology. At the conference, all of the teams introduced their
                                    project prototype and made comments on others’ designs. At the meeting, a professor
                                    from TMMU with rich experience in immunology suggested that if we do the project
                                    about the rabies vaccine, unpreventable immunology experiments would cost a lot of
                                    time and the results would be highly unpredictable as well – in a word, it would be
                                    very difficult to complete all the experiments within three months’ time. The new
                                    information tilts the balance one step more.      After carefully evaluating the advice from other
                                    team and comparing the two
                                    projects, we chose “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli” because it was more
                                    practical with more predictable result

                                </P><DIV class="scu_sub_title"><I>02.</I>  Improvement</DIV><DIV><P class="scu_content_p">      After determining the project, we found that
                                        there
                                        were many problems remained to solve. Therefore, we consulted teachers and
                                        experts from Sleep Medical Center, <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCU_China/HP/Silver/Survey#sleep_center">West

                                        What’s more, we also
                                        communicated with other iGEM teams via Skype.      During the interview with the Sleep Medical
                                        Center faculties, the professors
                                        described the mechanism of melatonin in detail as well as melatonin’s advantages
                                        over other drugs, which gave us a whole new view on melatonin. They also
                                        emphasized what to focus during the research, such as the safety issues emerged
                                        when we tried to produce E.coli strains secreting melatonin in human body, the
                                        dedicate relationship between the circadian rhythm of melatonin production and
                                        sleep related neural circuits and possible test on mouse in vivo. At the same
                                        time, to our delight the professors highly appreciated the practicality and
                                        novelty of our project. During the interview with the experts of CFDA, we got
                                        known of the national standards on melatonin in Mainland China, which drove us
                                        to focus more on legal issues and safety considerations.
                                              We had video chat with Team Purdue to
                                        introduce our respective projects. In this
                                        video chat, their real condition simulation experiments inspired us to do some
                                        experiments to simulate growth conditions in the environment of gut. In
                                        addition, we were inspired by team “SCU-WestChina”’s modeling of constitutive
                                        promoter family to make our modeling of enzyme kinetics by ourselves, in order
                                        to achieve more efficient production of melatonin with reasonable formula of
                                        enzymes.
                                              With the help of the Sleep Medical Center,
                                        CFDA and other iGEM teams, we finally
                                        arrived at the complete project design and improvement.

                                        encountered many problems as well; luckily,
                                        most of them were solved with our toil and others’ assistance.      SCAU-China provided LUDOX in the measurement
                                        kit, which turned out to be crucial
                                        in our InterLab experiments.      Limited to the rules of using plate reader
                                        in our public lab, we cannot use the
                                        plate reader in our public lab for continuous kinetic measurement of
                                        repressilator over 8h. Thankfully, Team “SCU-WestChina” provided us plate reader
                                        “Biotek Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader” in their lab to finish such
                                        experiments.      During CCiC, we learned that the project of
                                        the iGEM team of Peking University
                                        was closely related to repressilator as well, so we exchanged our experience on
                                        repressilator and maintained constant communication since. After the conference,
                                        we found in our experiment that the plasmid pLPT107 cannot be transformed into
                                        the ΔclpXPMC4100 stain that was knocked out by ourselves; thus, we turned to
                                        team &quot;Peking&quot; immediately. Gratefully, they sent their ΔclpXP strain to us
                                        immediately and shared their experience with us. This helped us a lot in keeping
                                        our schedule.      In all of the above mentioned survey,
                                        interview, study and communication, we
                                        obtained information and assistance that pushed us forward and enabled us to
                                        complete our project step by step. Finally, through our own hard work and the
                                        generous help of others, we finished a thorough, complete project with practical
                                        value.
