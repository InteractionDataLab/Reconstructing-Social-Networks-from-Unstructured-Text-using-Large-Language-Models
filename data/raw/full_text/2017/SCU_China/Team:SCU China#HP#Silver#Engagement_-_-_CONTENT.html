                                    trusteeship school in local area to organize a
                                    community class for children to introduce our iGEM team and knowledge about sleep.
                                    As the project of our
                                    team this year is to regularly express the melatonin in the intestine environment,
                                    our project is closely
                                    related to sleep. According to the results of our survey, most people don't pay much
                                    attention to their sleeping
                                    quality, or their ways of sleep regulating is not scientific. Their knowledge about
                                    sleep needs to be strengthened,
                                    and we believe that teaching children sleep is an important way to solve this social
                                    problem. Thus, we stressed the
                                    importance of sleep, and informed them when is the best time to sleep as well as how
                                    long they need to sleep per day.
                                </P><DIV><P class="scu_content_p">     The children in trusteeship school are all devoted
                                        into our class. Actually, some of them has considerate confusion about sleep,
                                        but they did not have much chance to access the knowledge about this area. They
                                        asked why we will dream and why our eyes will
                                        move when we sleep. In order to let student fully understand what we taught to
                                        them, we have arranged a schedule of our activities.     At the beginning, we separated all the students in
                                        two groups. During our activities, we had lots of questions for the students,
                                        which group’s answer was right, we gave them one point. At the end of all of our
                                        activities, we awarded the higher group’s students
                                        a peppermint.     And then came to the first activity. The name of
                                        the activity was “how long will you sleep”. The aim of the activity was to
                                        know most student how long would they sleep and then gave them some advice. We
                                        offered the students the opportunity to discuss
                                        how long will they sleep at their age is most reasonable. Then two groups of
                                        students told us how long and why. Their answers were
                                        literally convincing. At last we drew the conclusion that how long should a
                                        person sleep varies from different ages.
                                    </P></DIV><DIV><P class="scu_content_p">     The second activity was that our team member
                                        organized a game which can help children strongly remember what is the best time
                                        to go to sleep. The rule of the game was a little bit like musical chair. We
                                        just replaced the music into slogan “It’s 10 o’clock”. There was a research
                                        showed 10 o’clock in the evening is the best time to sleep. Thus we made
                                        students enforce their sensitive to “10 o’clock”.
                                             The third activity was a team member telling
                                        students what is a sleep pattern. The sleep pattern was told in a understandable
                                        way by describing a boy’s sleep process. Students asked a lot of meaningful
                                        question such as why we dream. We told them there was two period of our sleeping
                                        process: one is rapid eye movement, the other one is non-rapid eye movement. I
                                        believe they fully understand the two periods.
                                    </P></DIV><DIV><P class="scu_content_p">     The last activity was a game to made a clock by
                                        the cardboard. We would like to let the students arrange their time of the day.
                                             The class attracted many children and their
                                        parents. In the class, kids gained knowledge about sleep, understood the
                                        importance of sleep and let the kids know how to reasonably arrange their daily
                                        schedule. After the class, the parents and the children asked lots of questions
                                        related to scientific sleep. Our team members explained to them patiently.
                                             No doubt that sleep is a significant part of our
                                        daily life. Thus, we hoped to do our bits to raise the children’s awareness
                                        about the sleep and encourage them to be curious in our project, particularly
                                        when our project is so close to everyone’s daily life.

                                        from the Internet convince them that transgenosis is extremely harmful to human.
                                        As many Chinese don't have objective an understanding about transgenic
                                        technology, we think it's our duty to publicize correct concepts about it. It's
                                        also a good chance to collaborate with other teams and develop our own project.
                                        Coming up with an idea that hold a scientific exhibition, iGEM team
                                        SCU_WestChina contacted other teams involving TMMU_China, UESTC_China, and us to
                                        make an exhibition together about transgenic technology. We aimed to make the
                                        visitors understand what is transgenic technology and get some advice about our
                                        project from the visitors.     Eventually, SCU_WestChina got in touch with Chengdu Library successfully.
                                        Chengdu Library is a leading city center library in west China, receiving 1,010
                                        million readers in 2016. After several conferences with other three teams, we
                                        chose &quot;genetic modification and health&quot; as the theme of the exhibition. And then
                                        we discussed the content of this exhibition and designed the posters together.
                                        The exhibition was composed of four parts: disease treatment,
                                        biopharmaceuticals, disease detection, and environmental management. Each team
                                        was responsible for one part. And teams from Sichuan University and team from
                                        the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China completed forewords
                                        and conclusion respectively. We printed the posters a week ahead of the
                                        exhibition, and laid them out in Chengdu Library one day in advance. The
                                        exhibition lasted for 7 days. On the first day, the four teams went to the
                                        library early to distribute leaflets and small gifts to the public in the rest
                                        areas and outside the library. We introduced our theme to those readers,
                                        answered their questions, had discussions with them on genetic modification, and
                                        collected suggestions from them. The audience was very absorbed, and many said
                                        they had a more objective and comprehensive understanding about genetic
                                        modification, which makes us feel very rewarding. The four teams worked on the
                                        maintenance, publicity and explanation of the exhibition for the following days,
                                        and removed the posters and cleared the exhibition hall together on the last
                                        day.     The library exhibition achieved our expectation. Lots of visitors said they
                                        obtain much knowledge about transgenic technology from this exhibition. For
                                        example, people used to see chemicals produced through transgenic technology as
                                        a kind of toxin. But now, they know that the chemical nature of these products
                                        doesn’t change. With our explanation, many visitors removed their prejudice and
                                        misunderstanding about transgenic technology.     In the library exhibition, we cooperated with other three teams very well. The
                                        team SCU_WestChina contacted the Chengdu library and told them our thoughts
                                        about the exhibition. And we four teams made the posters which were very
                                        important in the library exhibition together. As we divided the theme into four
                                        sections, each team was responsible for one poster. In order to make the poster
                                        more clear and intelligible, besides responsible team, other three teams also
                                        participated in discussion and gave their suggestions about the content of the
                                        poster. In addition, when we had difficulties in explaining our project and
                                        ideas to publics, members of other teams came to help us immediately. If we
                                        hadn't cooperated with each other, this exhibition would not have succeeded. It
                                        was a fantastic and impressive collaboration which we would never forget.
                                        This exhibition was also a wonderful chance for us to put what we learnt in
                                        classrooms into society. Except doing experiments in the lab, it’s our duty to
                                        introduce the knowledge about biology and biotechnology to public as well.
                                        Through this activity, we did our bits to make public understand what is
                                        transgenic technology clearly.
                                    </P><P class="scu_content_p">     It’s also very important that we got many suggestions about our project from the
                                        public who visited the exhibition. We found that most people hesitated when
                                        talking about taking bacteria as medicine. So we considered to use a more safe
                                        bacterial stain as final product after we constructed the whole circuit in E.
                                        coli successfully. In addition, we found that many people worry about the amount
                                        of melatonin produced by bacteria in intestine. Therefore, it is necessary to
                                        test melatonin level in animal model carefully. These suggestions and feedback
                                        were helpful for us to improve our project. They make us understood public
                                        opinion, so we can develop our project in the aspect of drug shape, mode of
                                        administration and so on in the future work.

                                    Application: Human /Animal Health in September and October. The competition included
                                    the first oral defense and the final. Three of the team members, student team leader
                                    of team “SCU-WestChina”, and two advisors of our association were present as judging
                                    panel.     This competition required contestants participate in
                                    the competition in groups. And
                                    each group should design their project about Human /Animal Health. Then the groups
                                    took part in the defense to present their project. Finally, based on their project
                                    feasibility, creativity, safety and so on, the groups were awarded different prizes.     After the first oral defense, 7 teams were chosen to
                                    attend the final. The final was
                                    held in the one of the largest classroom in Jiang’an Campus of Sichuan University.
                                    More than 10 professors attended as judges. After the final defence, one gold award,
                                    two silver awards and three bronze awards were issued.

                                        identifies host cells by binding the surface glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 receptors
                                        on
                                        the surface of CD4+T lymphocytes. Cyanovirin-N(CV-N) is a protein which can bind
                                        nearly irreversibly to gp120 and changes its conformation, so HIV has no chance
                                        to
                                        bond to CD4 receptors. But this bonding only happens during the early time of
                                        HIV
                                        infection.     We intend to transfer the gene that expresses the
                                        CD4 protein into Lactobacillus
                                        plantarum and transfer CV-N gene into the downstream of Luxs-mediated quorum
                                        sensing
                                        system originally existing in lactobacillus plantarum. When HIV enters the human
                                        body, it will be bond to the engineering bacteria to form a mass complex, which
                                        will
                                        lead to increase of the local density of the engineering bacteria to the
                                        threshold
                                        value of the quorum sensing system. As a consequence, engineering bacteria can
                                        secret the CV-N protein immediately.

                                        However, this new therapy has not been applied clinically due to the excessive
                                        host specificity of natural bacteriophage. In response to this problem, we use
                                        site-specific recombination to widen the host range of Streptococcus pneumoniae
                                        phage Cp-1, making it infectious to <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> and <I>Haemophilus

                        Based on
                        the fact that Pichia pastoris contains acetyl coenzyme A

                        using the strong promoter and gene mutation, we can increase
                        the yield of
                        epothilone and promote the conversion of other types of

                        only achieve the high yield of epothilone B, but lay the

                                        insecticidal agent against
                                        cockroaches, which is also destructive to other arthropods
                                        but harmless to
                                        humans and animals. Spores were collected by two-phase
                                        liquid-solid method and
                                        then made into sporopollen. The PLGA is then used to make
                                        porous particles,
                                        mixed with sporopollen, and then compressed into two fluted
                                        blocks. Then the two
                                        pieces are combined together to form a maze, where
                                        aggregation pheromone
                                        targeted cockroaches is put in to attract cockroaches. As
                                        soon as a cockroach
                                        touches the maze, it gets infected with spores and ends up
                                        dying. Spores grow
                                        into bacteria and will be released in the colony of
                                        cockroaches causing more
                                        cockroaches to die. In order to improve the insecticidal
                                        effect, we have made a
                                        modification of the <I>Beauveria bassiana</I>: we have
                                        imported the fusion protein gene
                                        with protease, chitinase and chitin binding domain of
                                        cockroach and tps1 gene
                                        associated with trehalose metabolism. And then integrate
                                        them into the host
                                        genome, in order to enhance the virulence and and resistance
