                                mysterious yet important activity in our life – it costs us 25 years in average
                                lifetime. However, the quality of sleeping and the habit of sleeping are largely ignored
                                in public awareness. According to the surveys, about one third of the adults in the US
                                sleep less than the suggested 7 hours per day<SUP>1</SUP>.; in the UK, 32% people admit
                                that they
                                sleep poorly and 14% have used OTC (over-the-counter) remedies<SUP>2</SUP>. It seems
                                that young
                                people suffer more from sleeping issues: according to a survey on people under 44 in
                                China, only one in ten interviewees say that they can sleep through the night, and 91.4%
                                say that they do not feel relaxed and energetic after sleep <SUP>3</SUP>.      A CDC report states that the ratio of suffering
                                depression or heart attack in short sleep group (&lt;7 hours) is about 1.5 times of that of
                                the sufficient sleep group, and insufficient sleep would also lead to the increased risk
                                in having stroke, cancer and diabetes, etc<SUP>4</SUP>. Sleep is important, but it is
                                of unaware
                                importance.
                                      Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland
                                and controlled by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) whose endogenous rhythm is entrained
                                to the light/night period. Melatonin carries the information about daily light/dark
                                cycle and spread that message to the whole body through bloodstream. According to the
                                previous research, melatonin not only plays as a very robust biochemical signal of night
                                to synchronize the circadian rhythms, it may also take part in the regulation of human
                                seasonal rhythms, immune function, antioxidative defenses, hemostasis and glucose
                                regulation etc. The regulating system of melatonin is complex, and the physiological
                                function of melatonin is of great variety.
                                      Since melatonin is a hormone secreted by our body
                                naturally and has close liaison with sleeping, it becomes an ideal drug of regulating
                                sleep and tackling sleeping disorders. However, nowadays most of the melatonin is
                                chemically synthesized, which employs complex steps yet obtains low yield, bringing the
                                side effects of hazardous co-products, as well as low energy efficiency <SUP>5</SUP>.
                                Biosynthesis
                                of melatonin would avoid the production of toxic compounds and reduce the possible
                                pollution; also, the great compatibility with human body enables long-term effect and
                                easy modulation. Thus, we tried to build the E. coli that could synthesis melatonin, and
                                coupling it with repressilator to achieve periodic production and secretion of melatonin
                                in human body.

                                from tryptophan needs 4 kinds of reaction, including 5-hydroxylation, decarboxylation,
                                acetylation and transmethylation. However, the sequence of these four kinds of reaction
                                differs in different species. Based on the previous study of serotonin production from
                                tryptophan <SUP>6</SUP> and melatonin synthesis from serotonin<SUP>7</SUP>. we chose to
                                apply the biosynthesis
                                pathway of melatonin in Figure1 in our project. At first, tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC)
                                catalyzes tryptophan into tryptamine. Next, tryptamine is converted into serotonin by
                                tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H). And then, serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) catalyzes
                                serotonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS) followed by the action of caffeic acid
                                O-methyltransferase (COMT), resulting in the synthesis of O-methylated NAS, also known
                                as melatonin

                                produce enough melatonin periodically? Firstly, in order to couple the biosynthesis of
                                melatonin with repressilator, the last enzyme, COMT, is under the regulation of promoter
                                pTetR, a key part in the repressilator. In this case, the expression of COMT only occurs
                                during the period when the inhibition of TetR is lifted, and melatonin can be produced
                                periodically. Secondly, we want to use mathematical modelling to obtain the optimal
                                ratio of the four enzymes with a higher yield of N-acetylserotonin (NAS), and to choose
                                the combination of the constitutive promoters for expressions of the first three enzymes
                                based on this modeling result. This could reduce the extra energy consumption caused by
                                excessive exogenous protein expression as well as the impact on basic growth metabolism
                                of cells, and accumulate enough NAS. (Fig.2)

                                indicated that T5H might not be expressed successfully in E.coli, because the target
