01.  Project Determination
      Our team has always focused                                     on                                     solving the existing issue seen in the society, and we value our connection with the                                     vast public as well as our counterparts. For the year of 2017, we picked up two                                     candidate projects – both of which were trying to provide possible solutions to                                     present-day issues – one was “Rabies Vaccine Taken by Mouth” and the other was                                     “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E. coli”. We always want to be of help of our world; so before making the final choice, we looked carefully into the potential                                     social and scientific value of both projects, by means of initiating field survey,                                     interview professors and experts from universities and authorities as well as                                     collaborating with other iGEM teams.
      Our team has always focused on solving the                                     existing                                     issue seen in the society, and                                     we value our connection with the vast public as well as our counterparts. For the                                     year of 2017, we picked up two candidate projects – both of which were trying to                                     provide possible solutions to present-day issues – one was “Rabies Vaccine Taken by                                     Mouth” and the other was “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E. coli”. We always                                     want to be of help of our world; so before making the final choice, we looked                                     carefully into the potential social and scientific value of both projects, by means                                     of initiating field survey, interview professors and experts from universities and                                     authorities as well as collaborating with other iGEM teams.
      We initiated a field survey on the sleeping                                     quality and solutions Human Practice-Survey-Questionnairs to sleeping issues on the                                     streets and via the Web. The questionnaire used in the survey contains questions considering sleeping quality of both groups having regular timetable and working at                                     night, respectively, and the questions on solving sleeping problems and views on                                     using medicine to improve sleeping quality. The result shows that a large portion of                                     interviewees had sleeping problems, some of which suffered from severe symptoms;                                     however, few figured out a way to tackle with the issues. Meanwhile, when it comes                                     to the medicine, basic acknowledgement of traditional benzodiazepines medicines was                                     observed, but seldom do people know about the medicine of melatonin.
      To conclude, according to the survey, we regard                                     it                                     very meaningful and prospective                                     to employ the synthetic biology approaches to present new solutions to the issues                                     considering sleeping. With this knowledge as assurance, we began our design on the                                     project tackling sleeping problems.
      While we find the project on melatonin more                                     interesting and promising, the iSWU                                         conference led us to our final                                     decision. iSWU is the organization consisting of all the iGEM team in the southwest                                     of China, providing us the platform to share with each other our projects and                                     thoughts on synthetic biology. At the conference, all of the teams introduced their                                     project prototype and made comments on others’ designs. At the meeting, a professor                                     from TMMU with rich experience in immunology suggested that if we do the project                                     about the rabies vaccine, unpreventable immunology experiments would cost a lot of                                     time and the results would be highly unpredictable as well – in a word, it would be                                     very difficult to complete all the experiments within three months’ time. The new                                     information tilts the balance one step more.
      After carefully evaluating the advice from other                                     team and comparing the two                                     projects, we chose “Rhythmic Production of Melatonin in E.coli” because it was more                                     practical with more predictable result
02.  Improvement
      After determining the project, we found that                                         there                                         were many problems remained to solve. Therefore, we consulted teachers and                                         experts from Sleep Medical Center, West                                         China Hospital and China                                         Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) .                                         What’s more, we also                                         communicated with other iGEM teams via Skype.
      During the interview with the Sleep Medical                                         Center faculties, the professors                                         described the mechanism of melatonin in detail as well as melatonin’s advantages                                         over other drugs, which gave us a whole new view on melatonin. They also                                         emphasized what to focus during the research, such as the safety issues emerged                                         when we tried to produce E.coli strains secreting melatonin in human body, the                                         dedicate relationship between the circadian rhythm of melatonin production and                                         sleep related neural circuits and possible test on mouse in vivo. At the same                                         time, to our delight the professors highly appreciated the practicality and                                         novelty of our project. During the interview with the experts of CFDA, we got                                         known of the national standards on melatonin in Mainland China, which drove us                                         to focus more on legal issues and safety considerations.
      We had video chat with Team Purdue to                                         introduce our respective projects. In this                                         video chat, their real condition simulation experiments inspired us to do some                                         experiments to simulate growth conditions in the environment of gut. In                                         addition, we were inspired by team “SCU-WestChina”’s modeling of constitutive                                         promoter family to make our modeling of enzyme kinetics by ourselves, in order                                         to achieve more efficient production of melatonin with reasonable formula of                                         enzymes.
      With the help of the Sleep Medical Center,                                         CFDA and other iGEM teams, we finally                                         arrived at the complete project design and improvement.
03.  Experiments
      During the following experiments, we                                         encountered many problems as well; luckily,                                         most of them were solved with our toil and others’ assistance.
      SCAU-China provided LUDOX in the measurement                                         kit, which turned out to be crucial                                         in our InterLab experiments.
      Limited to the rules of using plate reader                                         in our public lab, we cannot use the                                         plate reader in our public lab for continuous kinetic measurement of repressilator over 8h. Thankfully, Team “SCU-WestChina” provided us plate reader                                         “Biotek Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader” in their lab to finish such                                         experiments.
      During CCiC, we learned that the project of                                         the iGEM team of Peking University                                         was closely related to repressilator as well, so we exchanged our experience on                                         repressilator and maintained constant communication since. After the conference,                                         we found in our experiment that the plasmid pLPT107 cannot be transformed into                                         the ΔclpXPMC4100 stain that was knocked out by ourselves; thus, we turned to                                         team "Peking" immediately. Gratefully, they sent their ΔclpXP strain to us                                         immediately and shared their experience with us. This helped us a lot in keeping                                         our schedule.
      In all of the above mentioned survey,                                         interview, study and communication, we                                         obtained information and assistance that pushed us forward and enabled us to                                         complete our project step by step. Finally, through our own hard work and the                                         generous help of others, we finished a thorough, complete project with practical                                         value.
