2.1  Introduction
      Given that the extra energy                                     consumption of heterologous expression is not conducive to cell growth, we do not                                     want to allow all the expression of first three enzymes to be controlled by strong                                     promoters. Instead, we want to use mathematical modelling to obtain the optimal                                     proportion of enzymes with a higher yield of NAS, and to select the appropriate                                     combination of constitutive promoters according to the modeling results.                                     In a plan of our project, there are two kinds of cells in our design. The first                                     cells can express the first three enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of melatonin,                                     including TDC, T5H and SNAT. Thus, in this kind of cells, tryptophan is catalyzed                                     into tryptamine by TDC; next, tryptamine is converted into serotonin by T5H;                                     sequentially, N-acetylserotonin (NAS) is synthesized from serotonin by SNAT. The                                     last enzyme of this biosynthesis pathway, COMT which catalyze NAS to melatonin, is                                     expressed in the second cell. The function of each cell is shown in Fig.1.
Fig.1. This figure shows the design of our project. Cell A                                         contains 3 process of enzyme catalysis, and Cell B contains the last part of                                         synthesizing Melatonin.
      When it comes to the field of enzyme kinetic,                                     the most famous theory to describe the                                     behavior of enzyme reaction must be the Michaelis-Menten theory. In the following                                     chapters, we will start with traditional M-M theory. However, we will modify this                                     theory since it’s far from reliable when it comes to a complex reaction system. The                                     reasons and results will be shown in the following chapters.
2.2   Overview of Traditional                                     Michaelis-Menten Theory
      Before the improved version, let’s take a                                         quick look at the traditional one. In 1913, Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten                                         proposed a mathematical model of the reaction. It involves an enzyme, E, binding                                         to a substrate, S, to form a complex, ES, which in turn releases a product, P,                                         regenerating the original enzyme. This may be represented schematically as:
      Where k1 (forward rate),k 2 (reverse rate),                                         and k3 (catalytic rate) denote the rate constants, the double arrows                                         between S       (substrate) and ES (enzyme-substrate                                         complex) represents the fact that                                         enzyme-substrate binding is a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation of P (product).
      By applying the law of mass action (the rate                                         of a reaction is proportional to                                         the product of the concentrations of the reactants), we can write down four                                         non-linear ordinary differential equations and a conservation condition.
      Here, CE, CE0,                                         CS, CES and CP represent the                                         concentration of enzyme, total enzyme, substrate, the complex, and the product,                                         respectively. To solve these equations, the traditional way here is to apply                                         quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) that we assume the substrate is in                                         instantaneous chemical equilibrium with the complex. Therefore, we can let                                         equation (2.4) equals to 0 as:
      Therefore, we get the reaction velocity:
      Where
      Kcat the turn-over number is the                                         maximum                                         number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per                                         second. The Michaelis constant KM is the CS at which the reaction rate is at                                         half-maximum. Thus, the concentration of production will be
      Both parameters can be measured by measuring                                         a single enzyme reaction with Lineweaver-Burk plot. The idea is to rewrite the                                         equation as:
      With equation (2.11) and experimental data,                                         we can easily get the parameters of                                         the system by fitting the slope, y-intercept and x-intercept. The y-intercept of                                         this graph is equivalent to the inverse of Vmax. The x-intercept of                                         this graph                                         represents -1/KM. However, we can only get 2 values from the                                         Lineweaver-Burk                                         plot, which is not enough to determine this system. The system contains 3                                         parameters, and 2 equations cannot help us solve the value of k1,                                         k-1 and k2.
2.3  Derivation of Reversible                                     M-M Theory
      Traditional M-M Theory seems OK on a                                             single enzyme reaction. However, the whole theory fails on complex enzyme                                             reaction system.
      Why is that? Let’s take a look back at                                             the very basic assumptions of M-M                                             Theory first. One of the basic assumption is that the concentration                                             of                                             substrate is much larger than the concentration of enzyme, which yields                                             CS>>CE. Therefore, the complex can quickly enter the steady state                                             quickly                                             enough for us to omit the variation of the complex and use the equation                                             (2.7).
      Hence, what is the restriction of                                             traditional M-M Theory? In a complex                                             enzyme reaction, things are different. This restriction might be OK during                                             the first enzyme reaction of TDC, but it will be poor in the reaction of T5H                                             and more poor in the reaction of SNAT. The substrate of the                                             intermediate                                             product Tryptamine and Serotonin is zero while the whole reaction                                             starts.                                             Therefore, we cannot use the M-M theory on a complex system.
      How do we fix this? Our method is to                                             abandon this irreversibility character                                             of the traditional M-M Theory by adding the reversibility between the                                             product and the complex. We can rewrite the equation (2.1) as:
      The difference between equation (2.1)                                             and (2.12) lies in the parameter k-2. This parameter may be small but                                             crucial to the limitation of reaction velocity. Then we can rewrite the                                             equation system (2.2-2.5) as
      Although we cannot get a simple                                             expression like equation (2.11) but we can numerically solve the equation                                             system. Here, as is shown in Fig.2. we can see the dynamical difference                                             between equations (2.2-2.5) and equations (2.14-2.17).
Fig.2. Here is the difference of two kinds of                                                 model. Both the lines are the concentration of the product P. The yellow                                                 line represents the result of equation (2.11) and the blue line is the                                                 result of numerically solving the equations (2.14-2.17). It’s obvious to                                                 find out that the traditional function means the product will linearly                                                 increase without limit. In real situation, it is absolutely not. The                                                 concentration of product won’t be larger than the initial concentration                                                 of substrate and the velocity will decrease as time pass by. Therefore,                                                 in our project, we use the reversible M-M equations. The parameters are                                                 chosen as CS0=5, CE0=1, k1,                                                 k-1, k2 and k-2 all equals to 0.1 for                                                 simplicity.
2.4   Reversible M-M Theory in Complex                                     Enzyme System
      The chapter 2.3 analyzed                                     the dynamical character of 2 kinds of                                     equations, but that only applies on single-enzyme situation. The reaction in cell A contains 3 enzymes. How do we model this complex enzyme reaction system? In fact,                                     our idea is to firstly write down the system as Fig.3. With Fig.3, we know how to                                     list our equations.
Fig.3. This is the whole reaction system in cell A. E1,                                         E2 and E3 are the TDC, T5H and SNAT. S is the substrate Tryptophan.                                         P1, P2 and P3 are the Tryptamine, Serotonin and N-acetyl Serotonin. ESi with                                         i=1,2,3                                         represents the enzyme complex. We assume that there is no other inhibition                                         between Pi with Ej (i≠j). Therefore, we totally have 12                                         parameters to be                                         measured. Note that the main difference with single-enzyme equations is that                                         P1 is involved in the reaction with E2 and P2 is involved in                                         the reaction with                                         E3
      Following chapter 2.3, we can easily derive the                                     equations as
      To solve the equations above, we need to get                                     the                                     kinetic constant k in every step of reaction. But how to determine the different                                     parameters? Lineweaver-Burk plot can only yields 2 equations, whereas we have 4                                     parameters in a single reaction step. Given this situation, we figured out a                                     unique                                     way to measure it. The key to the problem is to draw Lineweaver-Burk plot                                     forwadly                                     and reversely. That is to say, we can reverse the role of S and P, since every                                     enzyme reaction is a reversible reaction. Then, we can get the equation (2.19):
      Beyond (2.19), we can even include the                                     chemical                                     equilibrium constant equation (2.20)
      In this way, we could be able to determine                                     the                                     whole parameters in one enzyme reaction instead of reduce the equation just to                                     get a                                     simple but not practical equation (2.8). Also, we get an extra equation (2.20)                                     to                                     test the result of our experiment.       Aiming to measure the relative parameters                                     (there                                     are totally 12 parameters in this                                     complex system), our team measured the activity of enzymes in vivo                                     quantitatively.                                     Honestly, the result is not satisfying, but we strongly believe that our method                                     is                                     still applicable given enough time and energy. Hence, we would show the                                     numerical                                     result Fig.4. with equation (2.18), and the parameters are set optionally.                                     Still,                                     it’s good way to see the advantages of reversible M-M theory in complex                                     system.scientific supports, bacterial species and other available                                     resources.
Fig.4.The Blue line represents Tryptamine, the orange                                         line                                         represents Serotonin and the green line represents the N-acetylserotonin                                         that is                                         what we want in the final step of cell A. The parameters are ki=1mmol/L                                         (i=1,2,3…12 except i=4,i=8,i=12) and k4=0.1mmol/L, k8=0.2mmol/L,                                         k12=0.3mmol/L.                                         They are all chosen optionally, but the model itself is still general.
2.5  Summary
      With all the above mentioned, we believe                                     that we have derived a unique way of modeling a complex enzyme system.                                     Although                                     the relative parameters are sometime hard to measure (especially reversely                                     measure the reaction), but it still is a much more accurate and effective                                     way                                     compared with traditional way. Besides, there are still some more details to                                     add                                     to the model. For instance, enzymes won’t diffuse through cell membrane, but Tryptamine, Serotonin and NAS do. Therefore, if we add some diffusion terms                                     in                                     equation (2.18) like what we did in the modeling of repressilator, maybe we                                     will                                     get some interesting results. All in all, we hope our work can be helpful in                                     relative enzyme reaction system in cells.
