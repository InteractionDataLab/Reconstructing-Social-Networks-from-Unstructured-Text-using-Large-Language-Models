01  Background
      Sleeping is one of the most                                 mysterious yet important activity in our life – it costs us 25 years in average                                 lifetime. However, the quality of sleeping and the habit of sleeping are largely ignored                                 in public awareness. According to the surveys, about one third of the adults in the US                                 sleep less than the suggested 7 hours per day1.; in the UK, 32% people admit                                 that they                                 sleep poorly and 14% have used OTC (over-the-counter) remedies2. It seems                                 that young                                 people suffer more from sleeping issues: according to a survey on people under 44 in                                 China, only one in ten interviewees say that they can sleep through the night, and 91.4%                                 say that they do not feel relaxed and energetic after sleep 3.
      A CDC report states that the ratio of suffering                                 depression or heart attack in short sleep group (<7 hours) is about 1.5 times of that of                                 the sufficient sleep group, and insufficient sleep would also lead to the increased risk                                 in having stroke, cancer and diabetes, etc4. Sleep is important, but it is                                 of unaware                                 importance.
      Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland                                 and controlled by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) whose endogenous rhythm is entrained                                 to the light/night period. Melatonin carries the information about daily light/dark                                 cycle and spread that message to the whole body through bloodstream. According to the                                 previous research, melatonin not only plays as a very robust biochemical signal of night                                 to synchronize the circadian rhythms, it may also take part in the regulation of human                                 seasonal rhythms, immune function, antioxidative defenses, hemostasis and glucose                                 regulation etc. The regulating system of melatonin is complex, and the physiological                                 function of melatonin is of great variety.
      Since melatonin is a hormone secreted by our body                                 naturally and has close liaison with sleeping, it becomes an ideal drug of regulating                                 sleep and tackling sleeping disorders. However, nowadays most of the melatonin is                                 chemically synthesized, which employs complex steps yet obtains low yield, bringing the                                 side effects of hazardous co-products, as well as low energy efficiency 5.                                 Biosynthesis                                 of melatonin would avoid the production of toxic compounds and reduce the possible                                 pollution; also, the great compatibility with human body enables long-term effect and                                 easy modulation. Thus, we tried to build the E. coli that could synthesis melatonin, and                                 coupling it with repressilator to achieve periodic production and secretion of melatonin                                 in human body.
02  Design
     The biosynthesis of melatonin                                 from tryptophan needs 4 kinds of reaction, including 5-hydroxylation, decarboxylation,                                 acetylation and transmethylation. However, the sequence of these four kinds of reaction                                 differs in different species. Based on the previous study of serotonin production from                                 tryptophan 6 and melatonin synthesis from serotonin7. we chose to                                 apply the biosynthesis                                 pathway of melatonin in Figure1 in our project. At first, tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC)                                 catalyzes tryptophan into tryptamine. Next, tryptamine is converted into serotonin by                                 tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H). And then, serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) catalyzes                                 serotonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS) followed by the action of caffeic acid                                 O-methyltransferase (COMT), resulting in the synthesis of O-methylated NAS, also known                                 as melatonin

      Then, how do we get these four enzymes expressed to                                 produce enough melatonin periodically? Firstly, in order to couple the biosynthesis of                                 melatonin with repressilator, the last enzyme, COMT, is under the regulation of promoter                                 pTetR, a key part in the repressilator. In this case, the expression of COMT only occurs                                 during the period when the inhibition of TetR is lifted, and melatonin can be produced                                 periodically. Secondly, we want to use mathematical modelling to obtain the optimal                                 ratio of the four enzymes with a higher yield of N-acetylserotonin (NAS), and to choose                                 the combination of the constitutive promoters for expressions of the first three enzymes                                 based on this modeling result. This could reduce the extra energy consumption caused by excessive exogenous protein expression as well as the impact on basic growth metabolism                                 of cells, and accumulate enough NAS.

03  Results
To facilitate purification and expression identification, we                                 assembled the coding sequence of each enzyme with pET15b containing an N-6x His tag, and                                 results of colony PCR and sequencing demonstrated that we successfully constructed                                 these plasmids.(Fig.1)

      We purified these four enzymes                                 by affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA Resin and concentrated the purified protein with                                 superfiltration tubes to determine whether these four enzymes were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) respectively. And the results showed that TDC, SNAT and COMT has been                                 expressed successfully under the regulation of promoter pT7 in BL21(DE3). (Fig.4)                                 However, T5H seemed not to be expressed successfully. Thus, we used western blot to                                 further confirm the expression of T5H. Sadly, the results of western blot analysis                                 indicated that T5H might not be expressed successfully in E.coli, because the target                                 band (~70kDa) of T5H existed not only in the line1 (20x concentrated T5H purified by                                 affinity chromatography) and line 2(supernatant of cell lysate (E.coli with                                 pET15b-T5H)), but also in the negative control line 3(supernatant of cell lysate (E.coli                                 without pET15b-T5H)).(Fig.5) In addition, there existed a light target band in the line                                 7(Fig.6), and a obvious band in the line 1 and line 3 respectively. the SDS-PAGE result                                 indicated that pSB1C3-pTet-COMT could be expressed in E,coli, but most expressed protein                                 were insoluble. This may be caused by constitutive overexpression with a high amount,                                 which showed the need of modeling to determine a optimize proportion of enzymes to some                                 extent.(Fig.6)

      To verify the biological                                 function of these four enzymes expressed in E.coli, we used high performance liquid                                 chromatography (HPLC) to analyze tryptophan, tryptamine, serotonin, NAS and melatonin                                 content in extracellular medium fraction of E.coli containing these plasmids                                 respectively and wild-type E.coli BL21(DE3). Tryptophan, tryptamine, serotonin                                 (5-hydroxyltryptamine, 5-HT), NAS and melatonin were identified on the basis of                                 retention times related to standard sample. Content was determined by integrating peak                                 areas and converted to concentration. According to the retention time of the standard                                 sample mix of tryptophan and tryptamine, tryptamine compound of extracellular medium                                 from culture of E.coli containing pET15b-TDC was confirmed, which meant TDC expressed in                                 E.coli could function properly.(Fig. 7) Likewise, the biological function of SNAT and                                 COMT expressed in E.coli were confirmed as well. However, the function of T5H could not                                 be verified by us again, because the retention time of 5-HT was similar to a peak of                                 something unknown existed in extracellular medium fraction of E.coli’s culture.
