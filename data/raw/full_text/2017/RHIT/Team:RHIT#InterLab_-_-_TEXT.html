The Interlaboratory Measurement Study was an aspect of iGEM that seeks to standardize and improve measurement in the synthetic biology community. In 2017, the interlab study centered upon comparing fluorescence data over a broad range of locations, laboratories and equipment.. Participating iGEM teams were tasked with measuring GFP fluorescence from constructed testing devices in the parts distribution and collecting a fluorescein standard curve.
To measure the fluorescence and absorbance of our assays, plate readers at the university - Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology were used. Two separate plate readers were necessary:  a BioTek EL808 plate reader was used obtain absorbance measurements with Gen5 software, and the SpectraMax Gemini XS plate reader to measure the fluorescence with Softmax Pro 4.6. OD630 measurements were substituted for OD600 due to limitations in resources- no plate reader was available with the filter for OD600 measurements. All fluorescence measurements were taken with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm.
