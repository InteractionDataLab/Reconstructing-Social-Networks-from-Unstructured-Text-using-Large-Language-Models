China science and technology museum
Tinme: 2017.08.20
Personnel: Liang Ying, Xiang Zifan, Qiu Yaoyang, Zhao Mayang, Zhang Qiang, Jiang Hao, Liu Xinyu
   The members of BIT went to China Science and Technology museum for public random-interviews, synthetic speech, and micro-fluidic chip displaying. The members made folding papers and 3 posters to help public understand contents that we try to explain.

   There are more than 1,500 people that came across the exhibition booth, about 1000 visitors browsed posters. Moreover, the team members explained what synthetic biology was and how to use bio-chip to complete research to 300 persons or so. And then randomly interviewed more than 20 people. Here are some photos and video.

Middle school
Tinme: 2017.09.29
Place: Beijing Liangxiang Hope middle school
Personnel: Ma Yidong, A Yiman, Liu Xinyu, Zhu Yuqing, Peng Zhao
   The team went to Beijing Liangxiang Hope middle school. Due to the lack of instrument. Students there barely have chance to understand biology. They just get information from books. They do not know much about biology, Or in another word. They seems have no interest in biology. What we want to do is to show the beauty of biology and the creativity of synthetic biology to them, and help them understand lives in an interesting way.

   First, students were noisy, they just did their own things, as the members of BIT continued to explain synthetic biology and biological chips. They became more concentrated on class, more and more students revel in synthetic biology, they began to think about the use of synthetic biology, even asked us something about synthetic biology experiment. They also talked about their ideas such as regeneration of human limbs, changes in sweetness of vegetables, and the integration of multiple biological genes on the same organism. Although these ideas may not be able to achieve, they have the willingness to use synthetic biology to solve problems. That’s why we do practice like this.
 
 
High school
Tinme: 2017.10.25
Place: High School Affiliated to Beijing Institute of Technology
Personnel: Xiang Zifan, Zhang Shuyuan, Qiu Yaoyang, Liang Ying, Zhang Qiang
   The High School Affiliated to BIT is a school with advanced equipment, and some big laboratories. In order to make its students know about college life and stud, team BIT connected with High School Affiliated to BIT to develop an event to introduce the synthetic biology, the related professional and the process of scientific research to students.

   Some members of BIT went to the high School Affiliated to BIT and gave a small speech. About 50 students participated in the event. They recorded carefully and asked questions actively. They are interested in synthetic biology and are full of expectations for college life.
 
 
Collage
Tinme: 2017.9.12
Place: Beijing Institute of Technology
Personnel： Li Anyi, Wang Wenjia, Liu Xinyu, Wang Xiaoli, Yang Binkai, Xiang Zifan, Lu Shuyu, Ma Yidong, Peng Zhao, Liu Linshan
   The Team BIT planed a speech of synthetic biology seminar to the whole freshmen of The School of Life Science. Our team first introduced the main content of the iGEM competition, then gave a more detailed explanation of synthetic biology, and also carried out the exchange of experience and part of the project.

Public Engagement
Questionnaires
   The team release a Chinese version questionnaire on the internet, and we get 338 responses. People who completed this questionnaire are form different regions and different groups. With their help, we know the generally thought of different people in China, help us filled our story.

   Besides, we remake our questionnaire in English and release it as well. Than we got 13 responses.
 
 
Interview
Tinme: 2017.08.20
Place: China science and technology museum
Personnel: Zhao Mayang, Zhang Qiang, Jiang Hao, Liu Xinyu
   However, the online questionnaire is mostly completed by people from 15-35. So, in order to understand people's thought in different ages .we did a face-to-face interview towards visitors in China Science and Technology Museum. We interviewed 15 people in total elders, middle-aged people and college students are included. We get some great feedback.

BIT_Figure 10_Interviews in campus
   During the interview, we knew most college students are somewhat over-positive about their physical situation.
   So, back to school, we did a interview again. This time we interviewed 6 students and 3 school hospital workers, From our analysis the health consciousness of students are relatively weak. That also warn us that we need to make some changes
 
   This time, we got the most responses and useful advice ever. It is a breakthrough for our team. With the globalization of the world, we are trying to involve more people in our project. Next year, we will trying to make bigger plans and trying to be more considerate.
