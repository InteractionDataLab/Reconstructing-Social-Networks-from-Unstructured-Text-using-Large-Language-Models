Model
As for the meaning of the model, on the one hand our model can guide our team project, theoretically put forward the most scientific and reasonable program, and bring us inspiration to solve a variety of problems encountered in the work, which ensure the success of our project to achieve. On the other hand, The model can theoretically prove the feasibility and advantage of our project with the proving of Experiments, and fully expound our project.
What did our model achieve?
1. By establishing a mathematical model to describe the biochemical reaction process, the feasibility of the experimental target is verified.
2. We put forward the model that characterizes the Target detectors with easily detectable substances by using biosensors.
3. our project is intended to do the ultimate. Based on this ultimate goal, we need that there is a linear relationship between the direct test object and the target test object. So, we demonstrate and filter the tested substances that apply to our project through modeling.
4. We use the laws of mass action, Milwaukee equation, Hill law and parameter relationship analysis, etc, to predict the results of biochemical reactions under different initial conditions, and achieve the purpose of the experimental guidance.
5. We put forward to build dual fluorescent systems, in which two fluorescent proteins were introduced. We use the ratio of the two fluorescence values as the output signal, which play a role in the amplification of the input signal.
6. We analyzed the promoter activity. And we evaluated and guided our gene line design.
7. We use the law of mass action, Milwaukee equation, Hill law and parameter relationship analysis, etc., to predict the results of different initial conditions of biochemical reactions, to achieve the purpose of the experimental guide.
What were we modeling?
Our modeling is dedicated to verifying the feasibility of the experiment and guide our experiment.Our modeling will be divided into two large parts,namely Model of Biosensor and Model of Bioamplifier respectively.On the one hand, the modeling work of sensing part has an important guiding significance to biosensor experimental work and the whole project principle design. We have theoretically put forward the scientific and reasonable scheme, and have set out a goal and standard for other work in the team. project's design is based on insight we have gained from modeling. On the other hand, we have made an assessment of the whole of our project. As a project located in the diagnosis category, we use the model to predict the linear relationship between the material concentration, which is a good proof of our project is feasible, and has obvious advantages -- template.
