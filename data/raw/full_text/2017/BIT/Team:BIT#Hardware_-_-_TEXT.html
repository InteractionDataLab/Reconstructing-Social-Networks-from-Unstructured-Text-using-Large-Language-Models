This year we focused on JACOBâ€™s advantage of portability, efficiency and accessibility. The using of microfluidics chip achieves JACOB portability and efficiency, device makes JACOB roboticized, affordable and interface-friendly. Hardware, completing the conversion from fluorescence signal to electrical ones, was divided into two main functional modules: microfluidics chip and detecting system. Microfluidics chip, as the carrier of bead-aptamer complexes and E.coli, bead-aptamer complexes can detect cancer markers (AFP). Microfluidics chip guaranteed the fluorescent transformation while detecting system achieved the ultimate goal of cancer early screening. Our device is controlled via a serial screen, it achieves temperature control, detection of two kind of fluorescent protein and push liquid in the microfluidic chip, efficient and easy to control.
