Safety of experimental materials
1. Engineering bacteria: the use of the project for the lysine-deficient Escherichia coli, in the absence of lysine environment can not grow, it will not affect the environment;
2.Part: all bio-brick used in the line from the iGEM official plasmid plate provided in the plasmid;
3. Chemical reagents: All chemical reagents used in the project are laboratory reagents, there is no toxicity than the laboratory prescribed reagents, there is no flammable and explosive reagents;
4. Equipment: all the damage to the instruments are clearly classified by a dedicated person in charge of a unified recovery, sharp items can be put into the recycling container after packaging;
5. Waste: whether it is solid or liquid reagents, have a special waste liquid tank recycling;
