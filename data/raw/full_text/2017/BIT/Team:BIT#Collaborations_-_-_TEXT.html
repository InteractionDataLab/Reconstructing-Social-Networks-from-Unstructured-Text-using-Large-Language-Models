Collaborations
Team BIT have a collabrotion with 6 teams in all，here we thanks for iGEM teams XMU-China, NAU-CHINA, SZU-China, BIT-China, Fudan, CCU-Taiwan, without their help we cannot realize the results and make such a great progress. Wish we can have further connection.
1.iGEM_BIT&CCU_Taiwan
 
 
a.
We have had connection with Team CCU_Taiwan since last 2016 iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference. From last winter vacation, we discussed on the project’s track, method of detection and deliverables for Headquarters. We also had a video conference with SKYPE in August and both of two teams gave advice to each other after the presentation. Wish we can have a great meeting in Jamboree. Here is the link to their wiki .
  
2.iGEM_BIT&SZU-China
 
 
a.
This year Team BIT have the collaboration with SZU-China in three stages: 1. Two teams had a meet in BIT with visiting of laboratory, introduction of project and the advice change which gives a lot of helps on both two projects. 2.Team BIT was invited to join the corridor building by SZU-China where we can discuss online with different teams.3. SZU-China gave a support to BIT for building the wiki.Here is the link to their wiki .
  
3.iGEM_BIT&XMU-China
 
 
a.
This year Team BIT have the collaboration with XMU-China in three stages: 1. Two teams had a meet in CCIC and discussed about the idea of designing microfluidic-chip. 2 In order to make more teams worldwide can use microfluidic-chip and freeze - dried bacteria experiment in their projects. BIT and XMU-China made the protocols together.Here is the link to the PROTOCOL .3. For the scalable of the project we sent the microfluidic-chip to each other and do the experiment on the chips to prove the function.Here is the link to the their wiki .
  
4.iGEM_BIT&NAU-CHINA
 
 
a.
This year Team NAU-CHINA’s project is using bio-sensor to detection the toxin of the food. They want to use the microfluidic-chip and optical detection system to make the project achievable. Team BIT designed the device for them and also help them know about the microfluidic-chip, For return NAU-CHINA give the help on the gene knockout. Thanks a lot and here is the link to the their wiki .
  
5.iGEM_BIT&iGEM_Fudan
 
 
a.
With the collaboration of Team Fudan, we both focused on the detection of human hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). After the discussion of Fudan we improve a lot on our own project. We also shared JACOB to them, as return they talked about the GPC3 for us which are all used for early detection.Here is the link to the their wiki .
  
6.iGEM_BIT&BIT-China
 
 
a.
Team BIT and BIT-China two teams have carried on several communications about the project, daily works, the experimental processing and iGEM matters this year. We also take the improvement and optimization of experimental skills and experimental methods. Establishing the international Human Practice alliance with other schools around the world, and expanding the international communication among the iGEM teams.Here is the link to their wiki .
