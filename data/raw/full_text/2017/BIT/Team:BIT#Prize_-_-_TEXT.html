Prize
This year Team BIT makes great efforts and have a try to make the project be realized on demonstrate. In the meanwhile we have achieved the criterion of five iGEM Prizes : Integrated Human Practices, Education and Public Engagement, Entrepreneurship, Hardware and Best New Composite Part. Now here are the details for these Prizes.
Based on JACOB, iGEM_BIT opened a platform at China Science and Technology Museum for ordinary communities to understand synthetic biology and microfluidic chip. And a survey had been made to over 300 foreigners. We also discussed with middle students deeply and visited three industries and two healthcare centers for our project.For details please refer to Wiki Page. Click Here to see the Engagement.
JACOB is offering a new interaction between healthcare and patients, which allows treatments to be concentrated on early detection and precaution. It will improve the cure rate and be a financial relief, so that less conflicts will arise between patients and hospitals. These advantages make JACOB an awesome tool.

JACOB’s portability, efficiency and accessibility are built upon effectual inter-disciplinary applications of synthetic biology and hardware engineering. It can simplify the sample inputs, recognize GFP and RFP simultaneously and sustain a consistent environment for host bacteria E.coli. Overall, JACOB’s core is a creative and evolvable artboard for future practices. Click Here .
We recharacterized JACOB commercially based on investigations of the market and process of industrialization, in perspectives of consumers, commercial companies, and hospitals. There is a big market of household-level warning-diagnostic tools for serious diseases, just like JACOB. We are currently planning to resolve mass productions jointly cooperating with other institutes or capitals. Click Here to see the Entrepreneurship.
We modified and refined the previous part: J37032 , and created our new part: K2305004 ,its' fluorescent expression was eighty times higher than the previous part.Here is the link to the Composite_Part .
To facilitate early diagnosis, we contrived a biosensor of onset-pathological biomarkers with high sensitivity, affordability, and analyte modifiability. Here are three highlights: first, biosensor (aptamer) is able to be artificially designed aimed at target biomarker; second, bioamplifier (gene knock-out, strong promoter, cycle amplifier and dual-fluorescence) realizes improvement of signal to noise ratio; third, micro-fluidic chip and fluorescence detector make it possible that the assay can work in practical.
