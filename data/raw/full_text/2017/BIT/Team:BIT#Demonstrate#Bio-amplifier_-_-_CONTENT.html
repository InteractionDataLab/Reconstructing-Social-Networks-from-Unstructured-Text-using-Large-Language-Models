Before that, we have to make sure that the growth of wild type E.coli has no connection with lysine concentration. Part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K876070">BBa_K876070</A> was transformed into wild type E.coli to test its OD600 and GFP fluorescence every hour with microplate reader. Lysine was added in increments of 0.5ug/mL to establish a range of 0-3ug/mL. It shows that the growth of wild type E.coli has no connection with lysine concentration. From this, we can say that it’s necessary for E.coli ΔLysA to be the signal receiver of lysine.

To solve this problem and make sure that our own-designed circuit works well, we need to test the effect of the strong promoter, cyclic amplifier and dual fluorescence system respectively. The verified experiments are as follows. 
</P></DIV><DIV id="fh5co-blog"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row animate-box"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center fh5co-heading"><H2>2.1 Strong Promoter</H2><P>  To confirm that the strong constitutive promoter can induce plux promoter, we designed the biobrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2305004">BBa_K2305004</A>. The purpose of this biobrick is to produce as much green fluorescence as possible by inducing the induced promoter plux, to ensure a stronger expression in E.coli.
</P><P> We added a strong promoter on the basis of the previous part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J37032">BBa_J37032</A>. Parts from <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23100">BBa_J23100</A> to <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23119">BBa_J23119</A> are a family of constitutive promoter parts isolated from a small combinatorial library. With the addition of the strong constitutive promoter upstream the plux, we hope the plux promoter can be induced and therefore express more GFP. As the figure shows, in the first eight hours the OD600 value grew well, and the new part reached a higher GFP expression in E.coli than the previous part. Importantly, the new part has amplified the expression of GFP for more than 10 times. So we can say that with the existence of the strong constitutive promoter, the expression of GFP has been amplified. So it’s effective for us to put plux promoter upstream the route, in other to amplify the detecting signal.

On the contrary, the expression and the fluorescence intensity of the RFP are inhibited.

</CENTER><P>  To test the effect of the dual reporter fluorescence, the genetic circuits we designed are as shown. The pbad is a promoter induced by L-arabinose. We simulate the response of E.coli ΔLysA to the lysine concentration with the response of pbad promoter to the L-arabinose concentration. With the increase of the lysine concentration, the transcriptional efficiency of the pbad increases, therefore the expression of the lacl and GFP will also increase. On the contrary, the expression of RFP is low, because LacI can inhibit the plac promoter. Then we use the GFP/RFP fluorescence intensity ratio to represent the concentration of the L-arabinose. And we have worked out the relationship of the GFP expression of  <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K584000">BBa_K584000</A> and the L-arabinose concentration, as well as the connection between the fluorescence ratio of the  <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2305002">BBa_K2305002</A> and the L-arabinose concentration, in order to verify that the dual reporter fluorescence can improve the sensitivity of our detection.

</CENTER><P> The result is as follows. We built a relationship between the OD600 and the lysine concentration, the GFP and RFP fluorescence ratio respectively. Then we fitted the curve and found that in the third hour, we can get the best linear relation between the GFP and RFP fluorescence ratio and the lysine concentration. The R2 we got was 0.9984. Therefore we chose the third hour to be the time for detecting. The figure is as shown. Then we calculated the LOD(limit of detection). We plug three times of the error into the equation in the third hour, and got the LOD to be 0.000178 ug/ml lysine.

Discussion</H2><P> Since the GFP and RFP fluorescence ratio can hardly improve the sensitivity of the detection, we decided to use another way to make the dual fluorescence system effective. For BBa_K584000, we devised the growth rate of the GFP fluorescence by the amount of the bacteria, to get a curve about GFP-producing speed of every bacteria. The variate &quot;a&quot; is the amount of the bacteria in 100ul when the OD600 is about 0.1. We assumed the &quot;a&quot; to be 2000. For BBa_K2305002, we calculated the derivative of the GFP and RFP fluorescence respectively, and made a curve of the growth rate of its ratio. The L-arabinose was added 30ul in 7ml LB medium. The part with the dual fluorescence system can react the L-arabinose signal more quickly. Through comparison, we can say that the dual fluorescence system has a higher sensitivity and amplification factor than the part without the dual fluorescence system.
