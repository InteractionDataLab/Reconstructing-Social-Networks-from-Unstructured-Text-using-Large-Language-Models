With the existence of one molecules contains an amine and the other contains a carboxylate group, amino and carboxyl groups condensates can be formed using EDC.N-substituted carbodiimides can react with carboxylic acids to form highly reactive, o-acylisourea intermediates.This active species then can react with sulfo-NHS to form the carbonyl compound with ester functional group ,which can continue reacting with a nucleophile such as a primary amine to form an amide bond. Sulfo-NHS esters are hydrophilic reactive groups that couple rapidly with amines on target molecules.

It can be found that the nucleo plasmic relation of the BOC-Lys is 373.2497, the complementary strand is 901.5145 and the coupling product is 1766.0513. In order to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results, infrared spectroscopy detection was additionally used. The results shown in Figure 3.

The idea of replacing AFP with a single lysine has been achieved to some extent, but the experimental results show that if only one to one ratio is replaced, 0-3μg / ml has a linear relationship. In order to be able to reduce the detection limit, the project intended to use 10 lysine-formed lysine polypeptide chain instead of a single lysine coupled to the complementary chain. The advantages are as follows:
       1.In theory, the detection limit can be reduced to one-tenth of the previous.
         2. Trypsin acting on the lysine polypeptide chain is much more efficient than the usual amino and carboxyl groups formed by the amide bond .
 <SPAN class="lead">  <FONT size="3">iii.Coupling the carboxyl group with the amino group by coupling the mercapto group with the amino group</FONT></SPAN>
In the course of the experiment, we found that in the process of deprotection of TFA, a part of the lysine with a successful ligation resulted in the breakage of the amide bond, which resulted in a decrease in the coupling product and an increase in the cost of the whole experiment and production. This condition is not very stable. Therefore, the project is intended to use mercapto and amino coupling, can enhance the coupling.The stability of the fruit, and the lysine connection is more simple.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="fh5co-started"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row animate-box"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center fh5co-heading"><H2>Contact Us!</H2><P><CENTER>Please keep reading if you want to contact us.</CENTER></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER id="fh5co-footer" role="contentinfo"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row row-pb-md"><DIV class="col-md-4 fh5co-widget"><H4>BIT</H4><P>It's an excellent Team with thoughtful persons full of funs to the academic</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-2 col-md-push-1 fh5co-widget"><H4>Links</H4><UL class="fh5co-footer-links"><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BIT">Home</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BIT/Team">Team</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BIT/achievement">Achievement</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BIT/Notebook">Notebook</A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 col-md-push-1 fh5co-widget"><H4>Contact Information</H4><UL class="fh5co-footer-links"><LI><A href="">Beijing Institute of Technology No.5 Yard,Zhong Guan Cun South Street Haidian District, Beijing, CHINA</A></LI><LI><A href="">Wechat:iGEM_BIT</A></LI><LI><A href="">igem_bit@outlook.com</A></LI><LI><A href="">Facebook:iGEM_BIT</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
