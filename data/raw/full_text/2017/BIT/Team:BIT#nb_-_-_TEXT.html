March:
  
i. Week 1-2 (2017.03.04-2017.03.17)
    After discussion, the main goal of our project was to detect cancer of the liver by using small molecule
ii. Week 3 (2017.03.18-2017.03.24)
    After reviewing the literature, we chose lysine as our small molecule and chose lysine-deficient E.coli as our bacteria.
iii.  week 4 (2017.03.25-2017.03.31)
    We chose our main experimental method.
 
April:
  
i. Week 5 (2017.04.01-2017.04.07)
    We listed the plasmids we might use, designed the gene lines, began to construct our part.
ii.  Week 6 2017.04.08-2017.04.14)
    We constructed our first part BBa_K2305008.
iii. Week 7 (2017.04.15-2017.04.21)
    We constructed our part BBa_K2305011、BBa_K2305012 and BBa_K2305003、BBa_K2305002.
iv.    Week 8 (2017.04.22-2017.04.28)
    We import BBa_K876070 to E.coli, detect the growth and fluorescence curve of E.coil under various lysine concentration.
 
May:
  
i. Week 9 (2017.04.29-2017.05.05)
    We constructed BBa_K2305009、BBa_K2305010.
ii.  Week 10 (2017.05.06-2017.05.12)
    We constructed BBa_K2305014、BBa_K2305015、BBa_K2305016.
iii. Week 11 (2017.05.13-2017.05.19)
    We constructed BBa_K2305007、BBa_K2305006.
iv.    Week 12 (2017.05.20-2017.05.26)
    We constructed BBa_K2305016、BBa_K2305005.
v.     Week 13 (2017.05.27-2017.06.02)
    We constructed BBa_K2305004、BBa_K2305013.
 
June:
  
i. Week 14 (2017.06.03-2017.06.09)
    We begin to detect the growth and fluorescence curve of E.coil which imported our plasmids.
ii.  Week 15-17 (2017.06.10-2017.06.30)
    We have achieved the detection of the growth and fluoresence curve of E.coli imported our plasmids.
 
July:
  
i. Week 18 (2017.07.01-2017.07.07)
    We tried to knock out the lysa gene in E.coli by λRed recombination system.
ii.  Week 19 ( 2017.07.08-2017.07.14)
    We discussed about the problems we met in the gene-knocked.
iii. Week 20-21 (2017.07.15-2017.07.28)
    We learned how to produce competent cells and produced enough cells..
 
August:
  
i. Week 22-23 (2017.07.29-2017.08.16)
    We import some plasmids we constructed to lysine-deficinent E.coli.
ii.  Week 24-25 (  2017.08.12-2017.08.25)
    We detect the growth and fluorescence curve of lysine-deficinent E.coli we had imported our plasmids.
iii. Week 26 (2017.08.26-2017.09.01)
    To achieve the standard of silver medal, we sorted out 19 parts completed in totally.
 
September:
  
i. Week 27-28 (2017.09.02-2017.09.15)
    To reach the gold medal, we worked hard to improve an existing BioBrick, iGEM12_UT_Dallas’s BioBrick(BBa_K876070) and iGEM2006_Imperial’s BioBrick(BBa_J37032)
ii.  Week 29-30 (  2017.09.16-2017.09.29)
    To achieve the standard of the copper medal, we have improved the characterizations of BBa_I13973、BBa_I6088、BBa_K584000、BBa_K876070
 
October:
  
i. Week 31-32 (2017.09.30-2017.10.13)
    We sorted out our results and steps of the experiment.
ii.  Week 33-34 (2017.10.14-2017.10.31)
    We freeze-dried our plasmids and mailed it to IGEM, and then finished our wiki.
