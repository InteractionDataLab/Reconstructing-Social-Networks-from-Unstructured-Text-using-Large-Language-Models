The structure printed by 3D printer is used for fixing individual components.The microcontroller is responsible for controlling of the work of the various components,passing information to the serial port, processing the data of the detection.The serial screen is responsible for displaying the test results, and providing the human-computer interaction platform.The microfluidic chip is used as a platform for the entire reaction, and the detection is also done directly on it.Temperature control module and peristaltic pump assist microfluidic chip to achieve it’s function.The confocal detection of optical path is used to detect the fluorescence intensity.Here we will introduce their function one by one.               
  </P><DIV class="row"><H2>I Temperature control module</H2><P> Temperature control module provide constant temperature environment in the chip for two reasons:1. E.coil need constant temperature environment when they restore activity from freeze-dried state;2. E. coli have the best growth and metabolism state in constant temperature environment. </P><P><FONT size="4">1.1 Design:</FONT></P><P>  Temperature control module consists of alumina ceramic, heating film, temperature controller and its support control module composed of four parts. Alumina ceramic is the basis of the microfluidics chip, the microfluidics chip is made of alumina ceramic. The temperature controller controls the heating and stopping of the heater through the temperature controller's temperature sensor. The temperature controller should adjust the desired temperature in advance in the digital display. When used, place the microfluidics chip on the heater. The alumina ceramic allows the microfluidics chip to be heated evenly. Temperature control module base is made of nylon 3D printing, can be a good chimney heating chip and chip, while a certain extent to prevent microfluidics chip heat loss.</P><P><FONT size="4">1.2 Material:</FONT></P><P>  Alumina ceramic piece’s thermal conductivity is 23W/(m^2*K), and the size is 45 * 30 mm. Heating piece’s rated voltage is 5V, the power is 10W, and the size is 40 x 40mm. Temperature sensor’s accuracy is 0.1 ° C.</P><P><FONT size="4">1.3Working Process:</FONT></P><P>   Its working process is very simple:When the chip temperature is higher than 37 degrees, the control module control the heating piece to stop heating;when the temperature is higher than 37 degrees, the heating piece works again. </P></DIV><H2>II Peristaltic pump</H2><P><FONT size="4">2.1Design:</FONT></P><P>  The injection and the flow of liquid in the chip is achieved through the negative pressure produced by the peristaltic pump.Peristaltic pump suck the air inside the chip, so that the air pressure inside the chip will be less than atmospheric pressure.That’s how the negative pressure is produced.Under the negative pressure,the liquid will flows into the chip.What’s more,the flow rate can be determined by controlling the pumping speed of the peristaltic pump, and the liquid inflow volume can be controlled by controlling the pumping time.Through the experiment we found that the best speed of liquid flow is 37uL/min(Experiment can be found in 'Demonstrate').And the pumping time can be set on the serial screen. </P><P><FONT size="4">2.2Materials:</FONT></P><P> This year we choose peristaltic pump of model S100-2B + TH10B.This type of peristaltic pump has long service life and is small in size and cheap in price.  </P><H2>III Confocal detection of optical path</H2><P><FONT size="4">3.1Design:</FONT></P><P> In order to detect the intensity of GFP and RFP that produced by E.coli, we designed a dual optical path confocal fluorescence detection device.This is our optical path diagram, we used two high-power LED, four filters, five convergence lens, three long-shaped two-color lens and two photoelectric sensor OPT101.      </P><P><FONT size="4">3.2Materials:</FONT></P><P> This year we chose GFPmut3b,its excitation peak is 501nm, and emission peak is 511nm. And we also choose mRFP1, its excitation peak is 584nm, and emission peak is 607nm.Based on their information and the experimental data we obtained, we chose light sources and other optical components. Such as light source’s excitation peaks are 490nm and 585nm.For further details on other optical components, you can see  at the 'Component Information Table'. </P><P><FONT size="4">3.3Working Process:</FONT></P><P> First, the LED emits a laser with a peak of 490nm.Through the reflection of the dichroic mirror and the focus of the converging lens, the laser will forces on chamber II.The GFP in E. coli will be stimulated to produce green fluorescence with a peak of 511 nm.Fluorescence will eventually focus on OPT101.Similarly, red fluorescence will be detected by OPT101 in the same process.Through the photoelectric sensor OPT101, the optical signal will becom1e electrical signal, then it will be converted into digital signals through AD acquisition board.After that,it will be passed to the micro controller for analysis.</P><H2>Ⅳ Operation</H2><P> As shown in figure,while detecting,a user mainly need to finish sampling,injecting and connecting process.The specific reacting and optical detecting process is automatic,which can be operated simply on serial screen.Also,we designed concise UI on serial screen for users:    </P><P> As can be seen above,our UI offered brief guidance to users,making sure users can easily finish a detection.</P><DIV class="row"><H3><B>Demonstrate</B></H3>  <H3>1.Optical part</H3><P><FONT size="4"> Introduction </FONT></P><P> On the one hand, our chip is the carrier of biological reactions, on the other hand, the chip is also our optical detection platform.The object we are going to detect is GFP and RFP. The detection principle is using a certain wavelength of light through the chip to stimulate the GFP and RFP in the chamber and detecting the light intensity emitted by GFP and RFP.In this way,we can characterize the amount of fluorescent protein produced by engineering bacteria.Thus the relationship between the reaction of engineering bacteria and the light intensity was established.  So the upper part of the chip will not only through the instrument from the excitation light, but also through the emission light from the engineering bacteria. If the chip has a poor transmittance, both the excitation light and light will be seriously attenuated.Thus it will affect the detection accuracy.</P> <P><FONT size="4">Experiments</FONT></P><P> We used NOA81 as the material of our chip.
