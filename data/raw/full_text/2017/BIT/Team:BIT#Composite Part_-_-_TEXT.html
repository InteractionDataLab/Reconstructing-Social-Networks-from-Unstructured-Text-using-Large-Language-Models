Apply for Best Composite Part
This year we design our whole part including strong promoter, Cyclic Amplifier and Dual Reporter fluorescence, We also building 19 new composite parts and we choose the best functional part to apply for this prize.
The BBa_K2305004 is strong constitutive promoter pcat and plux promoter with GFP, we increase the value of fluorescence above 10 times to the normal plux promoter with GFP. For the results of the characterizations please click BBa_2305004 .
Modeling of Promoter Start Efficiency for Complex Part
The expression formula of promoter activity was constructed by Hill equation. β1 is the maximum starting ability of the promoter (generally set to 1), M1 is the amount of leakage of the promoter, SluxR is the amount of regulation factor, kd is the SluxR value when the model change trend is changed:
Among them, according to the database in the official website of igem , we can know the value of some parameters: the maximum capacity of start-up promoterβ1 = 0.6; the amount of the leakage of promoter M1 = 0; n1 = 2.
So we put these known parameters into the equation and get the value of kd at equal distances: 50,100,150,200, finally draw a rough image:
