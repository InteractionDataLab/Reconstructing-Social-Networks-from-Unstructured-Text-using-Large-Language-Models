The members made folding papers and 3 posters to help public understand contents that we try to explain.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 1_posters</H4><H4>BIT_Figure 2_folding paper</H4><P>   There are more than 1,500 people that came across the exhibition booth, about 1000 visitors browsed posters. Moreover, the team members explained what synthetic biology was and how to use bio-chip to complete research to 300 persons or so. And then randomly interviewed more than 20 people. Here are some photos and video.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 3_photos with some interviewers and kids</H4><H4>BIT_Figure 4_ Micro-fluidic chip displaying and explaining</H4><P> </P><P> </P><H3>Middle school</H3><P>Tinme: 2017.09.29Place: Beijing Liangxiang Hope middle school

Students there barely have chance to understand biology. They just get information from books. They do not know much about biology, Or in another word. They seems have no interest in biology. What we want to do is to show the beauty of biology and the creativity of synthetic biology to them, and help them understand lives in an interesting way.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 5_Group photos and students</H4><P>   First, students were noisy, they just did their own things, as the members of BIT continued to explain synthetic biology and biological chips. They became more concentrated on class, more and more students revel in synthetic biology, they began to think about the use of synthetic biology, even asked us something about synthetic biology experiment. They also talked about their ideas such as regeneration of human limbs, changes in sweetness of vegetables, and the integration of multiple biological genes on the same organism. Although these ideas may not be able to achieve, they have the willingness to use synthetic biology to solve problems. That’s why we do practice like this.</P><P> </P><P> </P><H3>High school</H3><P>Tinme: 2017.10.25Place: High School Affiliated to Beijing Institute of Technology
                                       Personnel: Xiang Zifan, Zhang Shuyuan, Qiu Yaoyang, Liang Ying, Zhang Qiang</P><P>   The High School Affiliated to BIT is a school with advanced equipment, and some big laboratories. In order to make its students know about college life and stud, team BIT connected with High School Affiliated to BIT to develop an event to introduce the synthetic biology, the related professional and the process of scientific research to students.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 6_Group photos with high school students</H4><P>   Some members of BIT went to the high School Affiliated to BIT and gave a small speech. About 50 students participated in the event. They recorded carefully and asked questions actively. They are interested in synthetic biology and are full of expectations for college life.</P><P> </P><P> </P><H3>Collage</H3><P>Tinme: 2017.9.12Place: Beijing Institute of TechnologyPersonnel： Li Anyi, Wang Wenjia, Liu Xinyu, Wang Xiaoli, Yang Binkai, Xiang Zifan, Lu Shuyu, Ma Yidong, Peng Zhao, Liu Linshan</P><P>   The Team BIT planed a speech of synthetic biology seminar to the whole freshmen of The School of Life Science. Our team first introduced the main content of the iGEM competition, then gave a more detailed explanation of synthetic biology, and also carried out the exchange of experience and part of the project.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 7_Speech in campus</H4><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><H2>Public Engagement</H2><H3>Questionnaires</H3><P>   The team release a Chinese version questionnaire on the internet, and we get 338 responses. People who completed this questionnaire are form different regions and different groups. With their help, we know the generally thought of different people in China, help us filled our story.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 8_ Where the questionnaires come from</H4><P>   Besides, we remake our questionnaire in English and release it as well. Than we got 13 responses. </P><P> </P><P> </P><H3>Interview</H3><P>Tinme: 2017.08.20Place: China science and technology museum
                                       Personnel: Zhao Mayang, Zhang Qiang, Jiang Hao, Liu Xinyu</P><P>   However, the online questionnaire is mostly completed by people from 15-35. So, in order to understand people's thought in different ages .we did a face-to-face interview towards visitors in China Science and Technology Museum. We interviewed 15 people in total elders, middle-aged people and college students are included. We get some great feedback.</P><H4>BIT_Figure 9_Interviews in China science and technology museum</H4><P> </P><P>Tinme: 2017.08.20Place: China science and technology museum

This time we interviewed 6 students and 3 school hospital workers, From our analysis the health consciousness of students are relatively weak. That also warn us that we need to make some changes</P><P> </P><H4>   This time, we got the most responses and useful advice ever. It is a breakthrough for our team. With the globalization of the world, we are trying to involve more people in our project. Next year, we will trying to make bigger plans and trying to be more considerate.</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="fh5co-started"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row animate-box"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center fh5co-heading"><CENTER><H2>Hire Us!</H2></CENTER><P>Facilis ipsum reprehenderit nemo molestias.
