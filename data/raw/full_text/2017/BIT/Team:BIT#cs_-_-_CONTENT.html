When a cancer patient is cured by taxol treatment fortunately, it should be owed to taxol's interaction with microtubule in dynamic growth process. So it's significant to explore principles of this process. We established a series of math works to clarify mechanisms of microtubule dilution system. Then we got data from wet parts of our project. Our model predicts observed data and phenomenon. In conclusion, we have presented a model that utilizes basic kinetics and it has been proved by experimental observations. We can use it to predict results in other conditions for guidance.</P><P>What we have done to analyze the dynamic process can be divided into three steps.</P><FIGURE class="text-center"><FIGCAPTION>       Fig.1 Our process

Then we presented two differential equations model. One is an original differential equation model that can predict taxol’s influence on amount of microtubule. The other is a partial differential equation model expounding analytic solution. Since it’s hard to understand if someone lacks of necessary math skills, we build a program in MATLAB<SUP>@</SUP> to visualize the kinetics in microtubule disaggregation.</P><DIV id="fh5co-blog"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row animate-box"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center fh5co-heading"><H2>Market Analysis</H2><DIV class="my-banner" id="top"><CENTER>&lt; img src=&quot;https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/b/b3/BIT_Figure_MEDAL_wwj.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;</CENTER></DIV><SECTION class="content_container" id="mytop"><DIV class="section-upline cd-section" id="Bronze"><H1 class="title-h1"><CENTER>MEDAL</CENTER></H1><P>This year, the final goal of iGEM_Bit team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB—essentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections—to ordinary communities. 
Our plan is to commercialize JACOB to provide warnings for potential disease and develop a self-sustaining facility for production and further research.
From market analysis, we concluded the prominent advantages of JACOB and focused on those to provide more competitive products; from direct interaction with commercial industries, we optimized JACOB's operability and compatibility with the market.

Comments: </SPAN>   Comparing to technology equipped by clinics and hospitals, The use of adjustable aptamer and genetic modified microbes made JACOB more economical, adaptable, and stable. The integration of automated proceeding made JACOB more user-friendly and portable. JACOB does not need professional physicians reading results, behaving like glucose meter but less risky. In China it is likely to be deployed in units of household or local communities. Similarly, for United States the Food and Drug Administration classified the core mechanism of JACOB as Class I medical device (if designed to not detecting cancer biomarkers), means no premarketing control is required. It is worth noting though, Chinese in vitro diagnostic market is relatively new and have few competitors. Those few players can no longer support the concrete increasing demand for medical cares. Chinese government had ratified a great number of acts as well as guidelines and simplified documents examining and approval process to encourage innovation in the field of medical devices, which offers our team a great market environment. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="第一段"><DIV class="row animate-box"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center fh5co-heading"><H2>Wireframe Connects the Underlying Conceptual Structure</H2><P>In market analysis we had solved many issues regarding our project background, but also generated more questions about operability.

Small Scale Trial</SPAN>    a.	Duration: About half year
                          b.	We will choose the production method for JACOB, e.g. as we learned from 永翰星港, the &quot;filtration&quot; of aptamers are still expensive, but aptamers synthesis is more economical. Nine sets of known aptamer (90np, 15 microliter, 100nmol/L) costs only about $135, and every set is sufficient for 250 microfluidic chips.   
c.	During this phase we also need to rule out unknown influences on the device caused by switching to new assembly conditions, such as switching to fermentation flask instead of tightly controlled experiment chamber. 
   
d.	During this phase preserving microbes will greatly affect the cost of production, and affordability is one of the most important characteristics of JACOB.<SPAN class="label-warning">2.	Medium Scale Trial</SPAN>   
a.	Duration: 4-5 months   
b.	When the production of microfluidic chip is resolved, how to prepare it for using will be on the agenda. Currently the chip we used for final packaging needs to be soaked in ethyl alcohol and acetone for about one hour, which pose a question for mass production. </P></DIV><P>We asked 博奥 mainly on how to control the cost of microfluidic chip production¬. From their experience we found that chips cost much more in the early development, but its cost diminishes quickly in later stages when mass production is reached, ranging from $0.1 to few dollars. However, there exist a conflict of material. In the iGEM version we picked optical cement instead of PMDS for its advantages of adequate solidification speed, feasibility, bio-inertia, and precision of altitude. However, PMDS production industries are much more matured. There is currently no companies offering mass production of optical cement microfluidic chips. Thus, we must decide the better material.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></CENTER></CENTER></DIV><DIV id="fh5co-started"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row animate-box"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 text-center fh5co-heading"><H2>Hire Us!</H2><P>Facilis ipsum reprehenderit nemo molestias.
