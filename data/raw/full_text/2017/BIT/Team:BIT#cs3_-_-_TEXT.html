Market Analysis
This year, the final goal of iGEM_Bit team is to provide the potential versatility, precision, and affordability of JACOB—essentially a representation of modularized biomarker detections—to ordinary communities.  Our plan is to commercialize JACOB to provide warnings for potential disease and develop a self-sustaining facility for production and further research. From market analysis, we concluded the prominent advantages of JACOB and focused on those to provide more competitive products; from direct interaction with commercial industries, we optimized JACOB's operability and compatibility with the market.
