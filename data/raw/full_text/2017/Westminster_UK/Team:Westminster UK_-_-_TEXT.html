Engineering of N-Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL) genes in the quorum-sensing     of Pseudomonas
Hundreds of millions of patients every year acquire an infection from their     healthcare setting, according to the World Health Organisation. Treating     these nosocomial infections is complicated by antibiotic resistance; there     has been a rapid increase of multidrug resistance (MDR) bacteria, including     strains of the gram-negative genera, Pseudomonas and Escherichia.     Opportunistic Pseudomonas are responsible for 10% of all global hospital     acquired infections which cause disease in immuno-deficient individuals. In     cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is estimated to colonise the lungs     of 50-90% of patients. A major contributor to bacterial antibiotic     resistance is the aggregation of bacteria to form biofilms. Bacteria within     biofilms communicate with each other through the release of chemicals, such     as N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), these quorum-sensing molecules are     essential to biofilm formation. This project will aim to develop strategies     to inhibit biofilm formation by targeting the specific genes responsible     for AHL regulation; ppuR, ppuI and RsaL in Pseudomonas putida. This     project has a vast range of potential therapeutic applications such as     development of biocontainment devices against MDR bacteria. This project     will provide a fundamental contribution to understanding and combating     antibiotic resistance with applications for treating nosocomical infections
