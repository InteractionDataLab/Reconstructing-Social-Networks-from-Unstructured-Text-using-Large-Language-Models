<h1> <b>Assaying Competency of E.coli competent cells (Round 1)     - failed attempt of transformation </h1> </b>
<li>Serial dilute DNA given by Sarah: serial dilute 6 times             to change concentration from micrograms/microL to picograms/microL             - 45 microL of water + 5 microL of DNA.</li>
<li>Transform 100 microL competent cells with.</li>
2 x 20 picograms of DNA (2 microL)
2 x 100 picograms of DNA (10 microL)
3.<li> Add 900 microL of LB media to all four .</li>
4. <li>Incubate 60min at 37 degrees C.</li>
5. <li>Plate 100 microL of 20 picograms and 100 picograms on     LB+kanamycin plates.</li>
Plate 800 microL of 20 picograms and 100 picograms on LB+kanamycin     plates.</li>
6.<li> Incubate plates at 37 degrees C overnight.</li>
NB: Cells did not grow at all. Initially thought it was either 1) pb during     transformation, or 2) cells are not competent. It turned out that we hadn’t     even done a transformation procedure - the above protocol is a recap of     transformation. </p>

NOTE: No growth at all: 1) the cells were not competent, 2) PLates have too     much antibiotic or wrong antibiotic.
<h1> <b>Biofilm culture part 1 (Round 1) </h1> </b>
<li>Inoculate Pseudomonas putida in 3-to-5-ml culture and             incubate at 30/37 degrees overnight..</li>
27/07/17.

<h1> <b>Biofilm culture part 2 (Round 1) </h1> </b>
<li>Dilute culture 1:100 in LB broth (1 mL culture + 100 mL             broth). .</li>
<li>Pipet 100 μl of diluted culture into each of four wells             in a fresh microtiter plate which has not been tissue culture             treated. .</li>
<li>Cover plate and incubate at 30/37 degrees 24 hours/48             hours..</li>
We are going to make 2 plates - 1 round bottomed and 1 flat bottomed.     Reason being that round-bottomed might not work/incompatible with plate     reader but if it does, uni has plenty of them that no one uses. </p>

<h1> <b>Biofilm Culture part 3 (Round 1) </h1> </b>
<li>Set up four small trays in a series and add 1 to 2 inches             of tap water to the last three. The first tray is used to collect             waste, while the others are used to wash the assay             plates..</li>
<li>Remove planktonic bacteria from each microtiter dish by             briskly shaking the dish out over the waste tray. To wash wells,             submerge plate in the first water tray and then vigorously shake             out the liquid over the waste tray. Replace water when it becomes             cloudy..</li>
<li>Add 125 μl of 0.1% crystal violet solution to each well.             Stain 10 min at room temperature..</li>
<li>Shake each microtiter dish out over the waste tray to             remove the crystal violet solution. Wash dishes successively in             each of the next two water trays, and shake out as much liquid as             possible after each wash. .</li>
<li>Invert each microtiter dish and vigorously tap on paper             towels to remove any excess liquid. Allow plates to air-dry. At             this stage, the staining is stable and the dried plates may be             stored at room temperature for at least several weeks..</li>
<li>Add 200 μl of 30% acetic acid (or another appropriate             solvent) to each stained well. Allow dye to solubilize by covering             plates and incubating 10 to 15 min at room temperature.             .</li>
<li>Briefly mix the contents of each well by pipetting, and             then transfer 125 μl of the crystal violet/acetic acid solution             from each well to a separate well in an optically clear flat-bottom             96-well plate. Measure the optical density (OD) of each of these             125-μl samples at a wave-length of 500 to 600 nm. .</li>
<li>Diluted 60% acetic acid to get 30% acetic acid: 30mL             acetic acid + 30mL water.</li>
