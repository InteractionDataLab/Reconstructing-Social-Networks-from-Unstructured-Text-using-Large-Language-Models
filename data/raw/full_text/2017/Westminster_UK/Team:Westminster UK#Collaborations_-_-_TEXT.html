18th August-19th August UK meetup 2017
Although the two days were predominantly meant for meeting other teams, talking about topics within the field of synthetic biology and practicing our poster / powerpoint presentations, there were lots of opportunities for teams to say "we need help with modelling" or "is anyone an engineer?". This allowed some of the problems raised were solved to be solved there and then, whilst there were plenty of opportunities for other collaborations to be formed with invited teams The meetup was the perfect opportunity for teams to troubleshoot their projects and gain invaluable advice from peers. Also the debating session made all team members think about the ethics and safety of the field, which could apply to integrated human practices.
27th September 2017 InterLab
As part of their Interlab study, the City of London School high school team had to quantify the fluorescence of their samples, and lacking the equipment in their laboratory, were invited by us to Cavendish campus and we provided their results for them. We also practiced presenting our presentations in front of academics from both institutions as well as their team helping our team create our model and wiki.
