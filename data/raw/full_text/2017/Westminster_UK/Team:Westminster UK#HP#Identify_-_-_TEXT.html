A SALIENT DEFINITION OF BIOFILMS OFFERED BY DONLAN AND COSTERTON         (2002):
“a microbially derived sessile community characterized by cells that         are irreversibly attached to a substratum or interface or to each         other, embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that         they have produced, and exhibit an altered phenotype with respect to         growth rate and gene transcription.”
The formation of biofilms on abiotic and biotic surface has a global effect     on our society. Two main victims of this can effect; One is medicine and     the second is dentistry. For example biofilms constitute for hospital     acquired infections – causing around 300,000 cases of hospital acquired     infections- this costs the national health service approximately £1 billion     a year. Bacteria constituting biofilms have the ability to be less     defensive against host defences than are planktonic forms of the same     microorganisms. Subsequent infection with caused by biofilms can manifest     in many clinical challenges, such as uncultivable species, chronic     inflammation, impaired wound healing, and spread of infection. You may     think, why? This is because medical devices such as catheters, pacemakers,     vascular prostheses regardless of their sophistication ae susceptible to     colonization of bacterial species.
In relation to dentistry biofilms can also increase the risk of HAIs.     Biofilms are the main culprit in etiopathogenesis of dental caries and     periodontal disease. Though uncalcified biofilms can be removed by     professional in the dental discipline, however these biofilms can mature     within hours and have the potential to calcify into dental calculus making     their removal difficult. Hence, these biofilms pose a great challenge to     the dental clinician in the control and eradication of biofilm-associated     diseases.
However, we as a team wanted to go further than, this. Rather than relying     on only research we get enthused with local communities and rather than     imaging our project contribute positively, we wanted to gain first hand     knowledge from disciplines from the front line. Therefore, we went with a     simple strategy.
Our strategy:
We know from literature that dentistry and medicine are highly targeted     fields by biofilms. However, we wanted to know the how’s, the when’s the     what’s. Moreover, we wanted to keep it simple but constructive, in this way     it would allow us to accurately understand different problems of each     aspect thoroughly.
1. How biofilms effect the healthcare community?
2. What strategies are already in place to reduce effects of biofilms?
3. How our project will circumvent these issues caused by biofilms?
4. Any suggestions to facilitate improvement in relation to our project
