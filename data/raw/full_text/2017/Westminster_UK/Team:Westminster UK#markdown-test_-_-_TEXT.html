To consider with SPION-loaded polymersomes.
Important Material Properties
Biomaterial Design Considerations.
Bio... inertness, resorbability, bioactivity, functionalisation, (inflammation, immune response, toxicity)
Topography / Surface Chemistry of a changeable structure? How to attach?
What are the adsorbtion / degradation mechanisms for the polymers and NPs. Byproducts?
Micro polymersome properties vs Nano SPION properties.
Cellular interaction (and functionalisation?) wrt physical / chemical attributes and biofunctionalisation? Surface patterning?
