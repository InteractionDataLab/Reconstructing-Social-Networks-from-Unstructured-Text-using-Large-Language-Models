    The annual University of Westminster iGEM science4U took place this year
    with 230 students (year 5 and 6) from 14 primary schools invited to partake
    in a day of presentations! We had puzzles and games prepared while we
    engaged with students about the realities and possibilities of synthetic
    biology. We found that the students were actually very open minded about
    the topic whereas the teachers bought more into stereotypes such as
    genetically modified virus bombs!
 </P><P align="center"><STRONG><U>New Scientist convention Thursday 28 September 2017</U></STRONG></P><P>
    Having heard of the New Scientist expo coming to ExCel centre this fall,
    the team decided that it would be a fantastic opportunity to join and share
    our project as well as talk about antibiotic resistance to the engaged
    public! The team were very excited to visit the exhibition and talk about
    our projects, we also ran into Warwick iGEM and exchanged project ideas
    (and stress!)
</P><P align="center"><STRONG><U>Biology week</U></STRONG></P><P>
    On the week of the 16<SUP>th</SUP> October, our team decided to join a
    group of academics to talk about biology as well as our project to
    university students. We also decided to use this as an opportunity to talk
    about iGEM in order to entice more students to join!</P><P><STRONG><U>Antibiotics unearthed talk on 25<SUP>th</SUP> October 2017</U></STRONG></P><P>
    Antibiotics unearthed is a public engagement project as well as a tool set
    out by the Microbiology society in order to develop new antibiotics. We
    were invited by Dr Linda Percy in order to give a brief talk about our
    project to a cohort of students. We also talked about what iGEM was and
    promoted the competition as a fantastic opportunity for students to engage
    in.</P><P align="center"><STRONG><U>Engagement</U></STRONG></P><P>
    During our project, we also decided also grow our media presence and thus
    invested time to try increase our social media presence. The official
    Bio-busters twitter and Instagram pages in particular were constantly
    updated.</P><P>
    Our social media activity also caught the attention of academics early on
    and thus allowed us to build up our team’s reservoir of contacts! We also
    got into contact with the university press and became published on the main
    page!</P><P>

    In order for us to assess the public perception of Synthetic Biology, we
    decided to hand out surveys on regents street and oxford street and
    collected the data. The results were somewhat surprising.</P><P>
    We found that although 78.6% of the 250 interviewed were aware of the term
    antibiotic resistance, data unfortunately showed that only 35.9% of people
    adhered to their recommended dose. Human error in terms of forgetfulness
    seemed t be a major cause of people forgetting to finish off their course.</P><P align="center"><STRONG>iGEM 2017 </STRONG></P><P>
    We are part of the university of Westminster iGEM 2017 team. The goal of
    this opinion poll is to gather public views on topics regarding our
    project. Our project is based on synthetic biology and genetic engineering,
    and we’d like to you opinions on certain topics surrounding our field of
    research.
