        A SALIENT DEFINITION OF BIOFILMS OFFERED BY DONLAN AND COSTERTON
        (2002):
    </STRONG></P><P><STRONG>
        “a microbially derived sessile community characterized by cells that
        are irreversibly attached to a substratum or interface or to each
        other, embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that
        they have produced, and exhibit an altered phenotype with respect to
        growth rate and gene transcription.”
    </STRONG></P><P>
    The formation of biofilms on abiotic and biotic surface has a global effect
    on our society. Two main victims of this can effect; One is medicine and
    the second is dentistry. For example biofilms constitute for hospital
    acquired infections – causing around 300,000 cases of hospital acquired
    infections- this costs the national health service approximately £1 billion
    a year. Bacteria constituting biofilms have the ability to be less
    defensive against host defences than are planktonic forms of the same
    microorganisms. Subsequent infection with caused by biofilms can manifest
    in many clinical challenges, such as uncultivable species, chronic
    inflammation, impaired wound healing, and spread of infection. You may
    think, why? This is because medical devices such as catheters, pacemakers,
    vascular prostheses regardless of their sophistication ae susceptible to
    colonization of bacterial species.
</P><P>
    In relation to dentistry biofilms can also increase the risk of HAIs.
    Biofilms are the main culprit in etiopathogenesis of dental caries and
    periodontal disease. Though uncalcified biofilms can be removed by
    professional in the dental discipline, however these biofilms can mature
    within hours and have the potential to calcify into dental calculus making
    their removal difficult. Hence, these biofilms pose a great challenge to
    the dental clinician in the control and eradication of biofilm-associated
    diseases.
</P><P>
    However, we as a team wanted to go further than, this. Rather than relying
    on only research we get enthused with local communities and rather than
    imaging our project contribute positively, we wanted to gain first hand
    knowledge from disciplines from the front line. Therefore, we went with a
    simple strategy.
</P><P><STRONG><U>Our strategy:</U></STRONG></P><P>
    We know from literature that dentistry and medicine are highly targeted
    fields by biofilms. However, we wanted to know the how’s, the when’s the
    what’s. Moreover, we wanted to keep it simple but constructive, in this way
    it would allow us to accurately understand different problems of each
    aspect thoroughly.
</P><P>
    1. How biofilms effect the healthcare community?
</P><P>
    2. What strategies are already in place to reduce effects of biofilms?
</P><P>
    3. How our project will circumvent these issues caused by biofilms?
</P><P>
    4. Any suggestions to facilitate improvement in relation to our project
