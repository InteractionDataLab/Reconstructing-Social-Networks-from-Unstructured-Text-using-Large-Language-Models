Science 4U 14th April
The annual University of Westminster iGEM science4U took place this year     with 230 students (year 5 and 6) from 14 primary schools invited to partake     in a day of presentations! We had puzzles and games prepared while we     engaged with students about the realities and possibilities of synthetic     biology. We found that the students were actually very open minded about     the topic whereas the teachers bought more into stereotypes such as     genetically modified virus bombs!
New Scientist convention Thursday 28 September 2017
Having heard of the New Scientist expo coming to ExCel centre this fall,     the team decided that it would be a fantastic opportunity to join and share     our project as well as talk about antibiotic resistance to the engaged     public! The team were very excited to visit the exhibition and talk about     our projects, we also ran into Warwick iGEM and exchanged project ideas     (and stress!)
Biology week
On the week of the 16th October, our team decided to join a     group of academics to talk about biology as well as our project to     university students. We also decided to use this as an opportunity to talk     about iGEM in order to entice more students to join!
Antibiotics unearthed talk on 25th October 2017
Antibiotics unearthed is a public engagement project as well as a tool set     out by the Microbiology society in order to develop new antibiotics. We     were invited by Dr Linda Percy in order to give a brief talk about our     project to a cohort of students. We also talked about what iGEM was and     promoted the competition as a fantastic opportunity for students to engage     in.
Engagement
During our project, we also decided also grow our media presence and thus     invested time to try increase our social media presence. The official     Bio-busters twitter and Instagram pages in particular were constantly     updated.
Our social media activity also caught the attention of academics early on     and thus allowed us to build up our team’s reservoir of contacts! We also     got into contact with the university press and became published on the main     page!

Public Surveys
In order for us to assess the public perception of Synthetic Biology, we     decided to hand out surveys on regents street and oxford street and     collected the data. The results were somewhat surprising.
We found that although 78.6% of the 250 interviewed were aware of the term     antibiotic resistance, data unfortunately showed that only 35.9% of people     adhered to their recommended dose. Human error in terms of forgetfulness     seemed t be a major cause of people forgetting to finish off their course.
iGEM 2017
We are part of the university of Westminster iGEM 2017 team. The goal of     this opinion poll is to gather public views on topics regarding our     project. Our project is based on synthetic biology and genetic engineering,     and we’d like to you opinions on certain topics surrounding our field of     research.
Please tick the appropriate answers, and fill in answers in the spaces         provided where appropriate.
