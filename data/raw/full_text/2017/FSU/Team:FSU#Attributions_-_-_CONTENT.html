Hopefully we will have 32 constructs for testing.

At the beginning of the 2017 Spring semester, he recruited iGEM members and advisors. After forming this team, he helped generate the team structure and workflow with the elected leaders, and continued showing support throughout the summer with candid feedback and supporting the fundraising effort. As we began to develop a solution to Celiac Disease, he performed a talk at one of FSU iGEM’s first public engagement activity with Moonshot Night. Now, as we are wrapping up our research, he has still been supporting the team by adding the parts to the registry, shipping out parts, and developing the skeleton of our wiki so that we can more easily learn and interact with the HTML code. Overall, he gave us candid feedback to better develop our deliverables and our workflow throughout this project.</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H2>EmilyPritchard</H2><H3>Secondary PI</H3><P>
         Emily Pritchard is the co-PI for the FSU iGEM team alongside Cesar. At the beginning of this project, she was instrumental in developing the leaders of our team by discussing project management and connecting them with Robert Potts. She was instrumental in recruiting Erin Smyth, our designer for the team that is responsible for all the cartoon's on the poster and presentation. She assisted in fundraising on FSU campus and is a big reason we are able to come to the iGEM Jamboree. As a member of the Moonshot Florida Board of Directors, she helped organize iGEM’s first public engagement activity with Moonshot Night. While Savannah Shewan was leading the conversation in the discussion room, Emily was overseeing Cesar's talk. Additionally she helped organize the public engagement with an elementary classroom (where her son learns!) and helped us get our book into print. Near the end of our project, she developed a template for our pdf documents on the wiki and even helped formatting some of those documents. Overall, she gave us candid feedback to better develop our deliverables and our workflow throughout this project.

         Jonathan Dennis is the Molecular Biology advisor for the team, but when we started this project we soon realized we didn't have a place to conduct our research. In response, he let us set up our experiments in his lab and even gave us his resources to conduct the research. More than just giving us his space, he continued to be a mentor for our Create team and taught them the techniques to use in the lab, helped us buy lab resources through VWR, and assisted in designing the analytic assays that we used.

        Michael Blaber is the protein engineering advisor for the team. At the beginning of the project, we came up with the three-module system and even decided on what proteins to use on the membrane, but the main issue was that these proteins were too large. He helped us refine our solution by using a truncated protein (keeping only the extracellular part). After this key suggestion early in the project, he continued to give feedback on our progress and helped us troubleshoot problems.

         Robert Potts was our project management advisor who was recruited by Emily Pritchard. While we were still developing our team structure and workflow, he gave a lecture on the fundamentals of project management to the leaders of our team. This led to us developing a team charter, a plan for the summer work, and a division of labor into our three workgroups.
