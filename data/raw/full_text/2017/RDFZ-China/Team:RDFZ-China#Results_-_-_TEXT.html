Achievements
We have successful results:
We helped to generate the data for the Interlab study this year.
We isolated two full-length genes - sfp and YerP from our Bacillus subtilis strain and successfully processed them into biobricks, and the sequencing results are positive.
We ligated lmrA into pHT01, a dual host, expression vector for Bacillus subtilis, and the sequencing result is positive. We measured the growth curve for our strain and tested two different transformation protocols.
We assembled our surfactin-producing operon by overlap extension PCR, and the sequencing results are positive.
We constructed a mathematical model and applied various estimations and confirmed parameters to obtain useful predictions.
We designed and constructed a sprinkler model that can be used to spray bacterial suspensions for bioremediation.
We adapted a protocol to measure leaching efficiency of different eluents in the soil quantitatively.
But we also have unsuccessful results:
We failed to ligate many of our biobricks into pSB1C3 at various times, which may be due to low ligation efficiency in our lab.
We didn’t do much characterization for our parts.
We didn’t have time to test for surfactin production by our engineered strain.
We didn’t construct our designed integration vector for B. subtilis, although we had prepared the fragments for Gibson assembly.
We had a difficult time of transforming B. subtilis in our lab, and we once contaminated the competent cells.
Future Plans
We will complete the construction of our integration vector and surfactin-producing operon.
We will test for the efficiency of surfactin production by analytical methods.
We will refine our protocol for testing leaching efficiency and test our strain’s ability to emulsify the oil.
We will analyze the eluate to see if the microbiome degrades the hydrocarbons.
We will deposit our strain in a real-world contamination zone and see if it works.
We will continue to analyze possible interactions between lmrA and surfactin as its substrate; then we will find mutated variants that could export surfactin more efficiently.
