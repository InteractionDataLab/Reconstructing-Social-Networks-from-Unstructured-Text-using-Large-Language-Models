Who are we?
We are Grade 11 and 12 students from the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, RDFZ! With high interest in and great passion for biology, especially synthetic biology, we participate in iGEM this year for the first time, representing our school. Our team is not only great at English, capable of communicate with other scholars globally, but also knowledgeable regards to synthetic biology. Top candidates in British Biology Olympiad and USA Biology Olympiad are in our team; as brilliant as our students, our instructors are highly trained, responsible and experienced, providing us important guidance technically during the project and sharing their unique experience with us to improve our experiments as well as managing the whole project.
