Week 1:  24/04/2017-30/04/2017
-The 2017 University of Sydney iGEM team met up for the first time (on a     public holiday)
-The project was introduced to us by our PI Nick Coleman as well as team     member Alex Kelly, who introduced the project to Nick at a BioFoundry     meeting.
Week 2:  1/05/2017-7/05/2017
Project design:
•This week the team discussed various insulin analogues on the market as     well as a new type of analogue which is starting to appear in the     literature. This ‘Single chain insulin’ keeps the C-peptide incorporated,     resulting in greater stability.
•We also discussed various expression systems for expressing our insulin.     Steph suggested expressing insulin in yeast. This was thought to be too     difficult as no one had much experience working with yeast.
•Alex referred to several scientific papers that summarised the expression     of insulin in the periplasm of E.coli - allowing for simpler purification     of insulin. He also suggested purification using a His-tag fused to the     protein.
•Various assays to test our insulin were compared. We compared antibody     assays (ELISA), cell culture glucose uptake assays, and an alternative C.     elegans assay where the bioactivity of the insulin can be monitored through     phenotype.
•The team agreed that we wanted to stay away from mice convulsion assays     due to ethical reasons.
Week 3:  8/05/2017-14/05/2017
Project design:
•This week, lead by our team legal expert Steph, the team looked at various     patented single chain and other insulin analogues and summarised their     features. We also looked through the patents for each of these insulins and     to determine which features are covered in the patent.
•We also discussed expression systems for our insulin analogues. Steph     suggested using Bacillus subtilis to secrete our insulin if the protein was     fused to a secretion tag.
-
Wet Lab:
•This week our PI Nick inducted us into the lab. He introduced us to the     other Honours and PhD students in the lab. We also met our team advisor     Mark.
Week 4:  15/05/2017-21/05/2017
Project design:
•Each member of the team received a free SnapGene license
•Our Secondary PI and protein expert, Jacqui Matthews, helped us design our     own single chain insulin analogue which we called Winsulin.
•The team narrowed down our research on insulin analogues and expression     and finalised which parts we plan to submit into the registry and/or     express.
•We planned to express 3 different insulins: Human Proinsulin, a single     chain insulin found in a paper called SCI-57, and our own single chain     insulin Winsulin.
•We plan to express each of these insulins in the cytoplasm of E. coli, the     periplasm of E. coli and to be secreted by Bacillus subtilis.
•Our parts each included a 6x His tag for purification. Insulins that will     be expressed in the periplasm will have an Ecotin ‘periplasmic-expression’     tag, and insulins that will be to be secreted will be fused to a YncM     ‘Bacillus-secretion’ tag.
•This leaves 9 parts to be designed and synthesised. As a team of 8, each     team member was assigned a part. Our lab guru Jamie was assigned two of     these gBlocks to design as he was especially enthusiastic.
•We hope to order them next week.
Week 5:  22/05/2017-28/05/2017
Project design:
•The team worked really hard last week to finalise our gBlock parts. Rough     draft of the parts were made. Unfortunately, these still needed work. The     team spent the week fixing up the minor details such as codon optimisation     for E. coli and Bacillus subtilis and restriction enzyme recognition sites     in our gBlocks.
Education and Public Engagement:
•Courtney started up our team social media pages (Facebook, Twitter, and     Instagram) as well as our team email.
•The team agreed to participate in National Science Week at the Australian     Museum later in the year in cooperation with BioFoundry.
•Fortnightly Skype meeting with Open Insulin Team!
Week 6:  29/05/2017-04/06/2017
Project design:
•Our PI Nick suggested designing our own E.coli/Bacillus shuttle     replicative expression vector. However, we do not think that we will have     time to construct it. This could be a plasmid we design for future USYD     iGEM teams to construct.
•Instead due to time constraints, our B.subtilis expression vector ended up     being an integrative plasmid called pUS258, designed by Yanwei - a PhD     student in our lab. Nick decided to use pET15b as our expression vector in     E. coli.
Human practices:
•The team explored various human practices approaches for the project,     including researching various charity organisations that focus on insulin     accessibility that we could get in contact with over the course of the     project.
•Emaleen suggested Health Action International and the 100 Campaign.
•Alex suggested getting in contact with Insulin for Life.
•Courtney suggested contacting the Australian government to discuss the     Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which currently covers most of the insulin     costs in Australia.
Week 7:  05/06/2017-11/06/2017
Project design:
•This week Alex prepared a flow chart as an overview of our project. This     can be seen below.
•Steph brought forward the idea of testing the functionality of our insulin     using adipocyte cells in a glucose uptake assay and consulted a few insulin     experts in other labs.
-
Human practices:
•Sent emails to Health Action international and the World Health     Organisation in attempts to hear their opinions on insulin inaccessibility     world wide.
•Fortnightly Skype meeting with Open Insulin Team!
Week 8:  12/06/2017-18/06/2017
Project design:
•This week we finally placed the order with IDT for synthesis of our     designed gBlocks!
Wet lab:
•This week we finally got started in the wet lab. With gBlocks still on     the way, the 8 of us spent time making up the essential media needed for     future lab work.
•This included LOTS of LB broth, LB Agar, M9 minimal media, RF1 and RF2     etc.
Week 9:  19/06/2017-25/06/2017
Wet lab:
•Erica and Emaleen did plasmid preps on JM109 cells which contained our     expression vector pET15b.
•Jamie and Steph digested the pET15b stock and ran it on an agarose gel in     order to quantify the concentration.
Human practices:
•Fortnightly Skype meeting with Open Insulin Team! We were getting excited     to show them our first results.
Week 10:  26/06/2017-02/07/2017
Wet lab:
•Our gBlocks finally arrived!!!
•Alex and Jamie digested our pSB1C3 stock and ligated the cytoplasmic and     Ecotin-tagged gBlocks into them.
•Erica, Courtney and Grace transformed these vectors into TOP10 E.coli     cells – colonies grew for each of the transformations.
Week 11:  03/07/2017-9/07/2017
This was the start of our winter break – however, the team took advantage     of the break and planned to get a lot of lab work done.
Wet lab:
•Grace and Emaleen performed a screening colony PCR on the transformations     from last week for verification.
•Ruby and Courtney ligated our Bacillus secretion gBlocks (YncM tagged)     into pSB1C3.
•Before transforming these vectors into TOP10 E.coli, we had to make a new     batch of these cells competent. Alex was in charge of this.
Week 12:  10/07/2017-16/07/2017
Wet lab:
•Jamie redid the colony screening PCR on the TOP10 E.coli transformed with     our cloned pSB1C3 vectors from last week in order to get a clearer gel. The     results showed that Cytoplasmic Winsulin, Ecotin Winsulin and Ecotin     Proinsulin in pSB1C3 need to be retransformed into TOP10 E.coli.
•Steph transformed the pSB1C3 vectors with the YncM gBlocks inserted last     week into TOP10 E.coli. These transformations did not work and we believe     that it is due to a problem with the ligation of the gBlock into pSB1C3.
Week 13:  17/07/2017-23/07/2017
Wet lab:
•Jamie redid the ligation of the YncM gBlocks into pSB1C3 and transformed     these vectors into TOP10 E.coli.
•Cytoplasmic Winsulin, Ecotin Winsulin and Ecotin Proinsulin were     re-ligated into in pSB1C3 and transformed into TOP10 E.coli by Ruby. Ecotin     Proinsulin and Ecotin Winsulin still didn’t appear positive on the agarose     gel.
•Steph did plasmid preps on TOP10 E.coli transformed with pSB1C3::RFP to     regenerate our stock of this plasmid
Week 14:  24/07/2017-30/07/2017
Wet Lab:
•Erica and Alex reattempted transforming pSB1C3::Ecotin Proinsulin and     pSB1C3::Ecotin Winsulin. These transformations worked!
Week 15:  31/07/2017-06/08/2017
•This week was the first week of semester 2 and the team were all back from     holidays and ready to continue work both in and out of the lab.
Wet lab:
•We received the WB800 strain of Bacillus subtilis which has 8 proteases     knocked out. This was kindly donated to us by Sui-Lam Wang’s lab from the     University of Calgary, Canada.
•Now that it appears that all 9 gBlocks in pSB1C3 have been transformed     into TOP10 E.coli, Steph and Emaleen performed a colony screening PCR on a     few colonies of each transformation to verify presence of the gBlock.
•Alex and Grace cloned all 9 Ecotin and Cytoplasmic gBlocks into pET15b.
Human practices:
•Courtney emailed Insulin for Life for more detail on what they do and what     they perceive to be the biggest problems contributing to insulin     inaccessibility.
•Fortnightly Skype meeting with Open Insulin Team started back up again! We     had some excellent progress to show them.
Week 16:  07/08/2017-13/08/2017
Lab work:
•Based on the colony PCRs from last week, Emaleen and Steph performed     plasmid preps on those TOP10 E.coli which showed a positive result in the     colony PCR last week.
Human practices:
•Dr David Beran from Health Action International replied to our email     asking for further information on the current issues with insulin     accessibility. Alex organised a time to skype him later this month.
-
Education and Public Engagement:
•Grace wrote up an Insulin Accessibility Survey and made it public on our     social media and the iGEM collaborations page.
•The team took shifts at the Joint Academic Microbiology Seminars (JAMS)     stall at the Australian Museum for National Science week.
Week 17:  14/08/2017-20/08/2017
Wet lab:
•Emaleen, Ruby and Grace performed double digests on the prepped pSB1C3     plasmids using the restriction enzymes EcoRI and Pst1. They then ran them     on an agarose gel to confirm that the plasmid contained an insert before     sending the plasmids off for sequencing. This had to repeated many times     until we finally got a good gel.
•Erica transformed the Ecotin and Cytoplasmic gBlocks that were ligated     into pET15b in Week 13 into pET15b. These transformations were successful.
•Steph and Courtney performed colony screening PCRs on these pET15b     transformations. Bands were not correct size
Education and Public Engagement:
•On the 18th of August, Steph participated in a webinar over Skype hosted     by the Uppsala iGEM team. In this webinar, five teams discussed the ethics     behind intellectual property and open-source science within the context of     the iGEM competition.
•The team continued doing shifts at the JAMS stall at the Australian Museum     for National Science week.
Human practices:
•Fortnightly Skype meeting with Open Insulin Team – this time joined by our     new collaborator in Ghent!
Week 18:  21/08/2017-27/08/2017
Wet Lab:
•Emaleen and Jamie amplified the gBlock insert in these prepped plasmids.     The gel showed correct bands following the double digest and PCR with high     fidelity polymerase, so they were finally sent off for sequencing. We will     need to re-ligate the other inserts in to pSB1C3 (AGAIN!)
•pSB1C3::Ecotin Proinsulin and pSB1C3::Cytoplasmic Proinsulin came back     with good sequencing results and these parts are now ready for submission     into the parts registry!!
•Alex and Courtney did plasmid preps on the positive TOP10 E. coli pET15b     transformations from the colony PCR performed last week.
Education and public engagement:
•The team set up a microbiology stand at the University of Sydney Open Day     where we spoke to future students about our experience doing science     degrees.
Human practices:
•Organised a Skype call with Dr David Beran on the 30th August
•This week we received advice from the university that we were at risk of     infringing patents if we went on to express SCI-57 and Winsulin. We     scrapped any work that had been done with these gBlocks.
•Steph came up with a design for ‘Winsulin 2.0’ that would not infringe any     patents. It was based on the design of Prof. Peter Arvan from the     University of Michigan. We contacted him and he gave us permission to     continue working with the sequence for Winsulin 2.0 in an open-source     setting as he had no patent claims on it.
•Courtney contacted a patent attorney, Len Mancini, who works at Maxwell's     for advice about our newly designed Winsulin 2.0.
Week 19: 28/08/2017-03/09/2017
Wet lab:
•We performed double digests on the prepped pET15b plasmids from last week     to verify insertion. We amplified the inserts of plasmids which, according     to our double digests, contained the correctly sized inserts. These     amplified inserts were then sent off for sequencing.
•In the meantime, we transformed the pET15b plasmids into BL21 cells to     start expression. These transformations were unsuccessful and will need to     be done again.
•
Human Practice:
•Alex Skyped Dr David Beran from Health Action International to discuss the     ACCISS reports and his research on insulin accessibility. It was an     extremely productive and informative discussion.
Week 20:  4/09/2017-10/09/2017
Wet lab:
•Sequencing from last week was entirely bad quality. We determined to send     off PCRs rather than whole plasmid, so Jamie amplified the inserts in the     pET15b vector and sent them off for sequencing again.
•Courtney also redid the transformations of pET15b-gBlock into BL21, as     they didn’t work last week. This time we finally got some successfully     transformed cells!
•Emaleen performed colony PCR on these transformants and correctly sized     bands were seen. We hope to start induction next week.
Education and Public Engagement:
•Courtney, Grace, Emaleen and Jamie gave a talk about iGEM and our project     at an event hosted by the USYD Biomod team. These excellent scientists are     entered in the Biomod competition which focuses on biomolecular design.
Week 21:  11/09/2017-17/09/2017
Wet Lab:
•Alex made competent DH5α cells to use in the Interlab study.
•Erica started transforming the test constructs into DH5α and performing     colony PCRs on them for verification of transformation
•Emaleen amplified the YncM proinsulin gBlock cloned into pSB1C3 for     sequencing
•We received new primers that bind either side of the gBlock inserts in     pET15b.
•Alex did IPTG induction on BL21 cells transformed with pET15b containing     Ecotin and Cytoplasmic gBlocks.
-
Human Practices:
•Len Mancini, the patent attorney Courtney contacted a few weeks ago has     agreed to assist us with looking through patents and our Winsulin 2.0     sequence
•Courtney called Neil from Insulin for Life to discuss what goes on behind     the scenes at their organisation and to learn about the struggles of     sending insulin to impoverished countries with poor distribution systems.
Week 22:  18/09/2017-24/09/2017
Wet Lab:
•Erica and Emaleen finalised the transformation of Interlab study test and     control plasmids into DH5α cells and performed a colony PCR to verify this     transformation
•Jamie sent off pSB1C3::YncM Proinsulin for sequencing to verify the insert
Education and public engagement:
•The team attended the Synthetic Biology Australasia conference and Emaleen and Jamie gave a short presentation on our project
Week 23:  25/09/2017-1/10/2017
Wet lab:
•Emaleen and Erica performed the fluorescence and OD600 readings on the     cells for the Interlab study and submitted last minute on Friday!
•Courtney and Alex cloned Ecotin-Winsulin 2.0, YncM-Winsulin 2.0 and     Cytoplasmic-Winsulin 2.0 into pSB1C3 and transformed them into E.coli     TOP10, while simultaneously performing the ligation into pET15b.
•Steph and Grace transformed pET15B::Cytoplasmic-Winsulin 2.0 and     pET15b::Ecotin-Winsulin 2.0 into TOP10 E. coli.
•We ordered precast SDS-PAGE gels as our own gel casting skills left a lot     to be desired.
Week 24:  2/10/2017-8/10/2017
Wet lab:
•Erica and Alex performed colony PCRs on the pSB1C3 and pET15b plasmids     transformed into TOP10 E.coli last week.
•Many many gels were run and eventually we saw at least one positive result     for each colony PCR. Below is just two of these gels loaded with the PCRs     performed on the pET15b with Ecotin proinsulin inserted
Week 25:  9/10/2017-15/10/2017
Wet lab:
•Jamie sent some pSB1C3 submission vectors, some pET15b E. coli expression     vectors, and the pUS258 B. subtilis expression vectors off to sequencing to     verify correct gBlock insertion. Got verification of correct insertion so     that we can progress with submission into the parts registry and also     verification that we have the correct inserts in our expression vectors.
•Alex performed autoinduction on our BL21 cells transformed with our pET15b     expression vectors with with our Cytoplasmic and Ecotin gBlock inserts.
•He then did periplasmic chloroform extraction for the cells transformed     with the Ecotin constructs and cytoplasmic extraction for those with the     cytoplasmic constructs and ran them on an SDS-PAGE gel. We did not get     conclusive results from this method, partly due to a disputable negative     control. Will go back to IPTG induction.
Human Practices:
•Grace, Alex and Emaleen met with USYD bioethics expert Dr Narcyz Ghinea     who specialises in the ethics behind high cost medicines. We discussed     issues with how medicines are priced and the costs of going through     clinical trials.
Education and Public Involvement:
•We were visited in the lab by a group of year 10 girls from Mt St     Benedicts school. Our PI Nick spoke to them about microbes in our     environment and Ruby, Grace and Emaleen taught them how to gram stain and     use a microscope.
Week 26:  16/10/2017-22/10/2017
Wet lab:
•Emaleen and Grace made competent B. subtilis WB800 cells.
•Erica transformed our bacillus expression vectors pUS258::Yncm-Winsulin     and pUS258::Yncm-Proinsulin into our competent WB800 B. subtilis cells.     These transformants were patched to a starch plate to identify where the     gene had been correctly integrated into the genome:
WB800 pUS258::YncM proinsulin
WB800 pUS258::YncM Winsulin
•Erica and Jamie transformed our sequence verified pET15B with Ecotin     tagged gBlocks into E.coli expression vectors into BL21.
•We decided to express the cytoplasmic gBlocks in the SHUFFLE strain as     this strain will aid in the folding of cytoplasmic proteins.
•Alex and Courtney IPTG induced transformed B. subtilis and E.coli cells     transformed with our pET15B and pUS258 expression vectors. Grace and Alex     extracted the proteins and His-tag purified them, then and ran non-His tag     purified and His-tag purified samples on SDS-page gels. This didn’t give     any indication of protein expression. Alex and Grace then ran whole cell     lysates of these induced cells on a gel. It was still difficult to see     whether any protein expression has been induced
Week 27: 23/10/2017-29/10/2017
Wet Lab:
•Grace continued to run SDS-PAGE gels on our induced cell lysates for     insulin detection.
•We received the last of the sequencing data which correctly verified our     gBlocks were correctly inserted into pSB1C3.
•Jamie did one final double digest for our parts and found that 5/6 of them     were able to be submitted. YncM proinsulin could not be submitted as the     double digest resulted in multiple bands. The parts were sent off on the     27th of October.
•Jamie, Emaleen, Ruby and Steph performed an ELISA and glucose uptake assay     on our cell lysates.
•The sandwich ELISA test detected insulin in the induced cell lysates     expressing parts Cytoplasmic Proinsulin, Ecotin Winsulin, Cytoplasmic     Winsulin and YncM Winsulin. The visible colours that appeared at the end of     this ELISA was single handedly the most exciting moment of this project.
•The Glucose uptake assay showed some increased activity, however we were     hesitant to draw a strong conclusion from this before showing to some     experts.
Integrated Human practices/Entrepreneurship:
•The team met with Mike Nicholls at the USYD start up hub Incubate as well     as Main Sequence Ventures to discuss the future of our project.
