This variant has undergone site directed mutagenesis to increase the folding rate of the chromoprotein and enhance the blue colour. We are taking advantage of this protein to enable blue-white screening without the need for adding X-gal to the plates. Cloning with the two multiple cloning sites that flank SF AmilCP-6 essentially swaps it with the insert to leave the recombinant bacteria white rather than blue. </H4></DIV></DIV></DIV><PRE>&lt;trackmarker markerclass=&quot;markerhover&quot; style=&quot;fill:rgba(0,0,128,.4)&quot; start=&quot;482&quot; end=&quot;567&quot; wadjust=&quot;8&quot; vadjust=&quot;-4&quot; markerclick=&quot;markerClick($event, $marker)&quot;&gt;&lt;markerlabel labelclass=&quot;markerlabel&quot; text=&quot;LEUII&quot; style=&quot;fill:#fff;font-weight:700&quot; &gt;&lt;/markerlabel&gt;&lt;/trackmarker&gt;</PRE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
