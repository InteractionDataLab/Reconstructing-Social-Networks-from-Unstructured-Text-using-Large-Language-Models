Firstly, Human insulin purification takes a long time and, depending on the method used, can be very expensive. We investigated alternatives to this process, and we came up with a few expression systems that could be used to improve the folding of insulin inside Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Secondly, insulin is currently stored at 4°C to preserve its activity. Keeping insulin at this temperature in cold storage chains while it’s being transported is incredibly difficult. This is especially so in lower economic countries, where we hope our insulin will be able to be sold. 
So we thought, what if we <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/Design">designed our own, single chain, open source insulin</A> that is also thermostable?

				Hi! As a part of the not-for-profit group <A href="https://www.insulinforlife.org/">Insulin for Life</A>, I currently work to export insulin from Australia to all corners of the globe. We haven’t had any issues with the activity of the insulin we distribute, even though we don’t use any cold chain transportation.

Endocrinologists are hesitant to put their patients on biosimilars because they can never be taken off that specific biosimilar. Generally, if a person is taken off one insulin biosimilar and put on a different analogue, they will suffer from an allergic reaction to the new insulin!

                Well we’d better make sure that our insulin is classified as an analogue, not a biosimilar. Unfortunately, Human Insulin will be classified as a biosimilar, but we have designed it to be exactly the same as the human form. Since there aren’t any ‘other’ bits on Human insulin like His-tags or TEV digestion sites, we hypothesise that there will be no adverse reactions or allergies brought on by Human Insulin.

                Would you like some quick tips on how to figure out if you will be free to market the insulin you have developed.

				Yes please! We have designed a single chain insulin with a 12 amino acid length linker between the A and B chains, and have made no changes to the human insulin A chain. We have added a glycine to the B chain, as this immensely increases stability.

				The main thing you need to read when looking at a patent to begin with is the claims. If you read a claim, and your proposed product falls within the scope of any single claim, then you would infringe the patent (and could be open to a law suit). However, if your product doesn’t fall within the scope of that claim you would not infringe.  One thing to be aware of, howwver, is that “patents” are published at the application stage and also again after they are granted. If they are granted at all. So the first thing you do is check the status of the application at the time it was published. If it was just an application, then the claims may be broader than what would ultimately issue from the Patent Office, or indeed, no claims may gain aceptance and the application may lapse. If you fall within a claim of an application its best to dig deeper and see if the patent is likely to be granted by getting any available examination reports for that application, or any foreign equivalent identified through patent family searches. Its not a quick and easy job!

				– If I were you, I’d consider all the insulins on the market, taking a particular focus on Single Chain Insulins. We already know that the human insulin hormone itself is off patent, but you may want to check that subsequent patents on methods of manufacture or particular formulations or compositions weren’t granted and are still active today. Checking process patents in general, especially for your Bacillus expression system, would be important too. Patents for processes and advanced compositions are generally patented by the original owners as a way to extend the monopoly over their product.

				We definitely need to design our insulin after we check all of the relevant patents for single chain insulins. Expression systems and methodology should then follow. How long would it take, and about how much would it cost for your firm to investigate this for us?

 				Investigating whether a product is  able to marketed legally is a very time intense process invoving muliple searches and months of analysis. The whole process genrally is conducted over multiple years  (to account for the patent black spot – 18 months in which applications remained unpublished) and cost over $100,000 if many aspect of the product need to be cleared.

                Hey, also don't forget there are also different types of insulin and we need them for different things - so their actual physiological effect is really important. I’ve used both before but am currently using short acting only with my insulin pump.

				Wow, that’s so helpful! Since you can’t have the same insulin being short AND long acting, its good to aim to create an insulin that’s one or the other. Ruby will be able to do some cool <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/Model">modelling</A> to predict whether our Winsulin will be short-acting or long-acting so we can see which areas would most benefit from our insulin.

				</DIV><DIV class="interlude"><SPAN>Ultimately, we have two insulin products. Our first insulin, Human Insulin, will be exactly the same as the one we produce in our human beta cells. Our other insulin, our newly designed insulin Winsulin, will have the same A and B chains as Human Insulin, but contains a smaller, 12 amino acid length C peptide linker. From our predictive modelling, we predict the Winsulin will be a short acting insulin. We also believe that our Winsulin will not fall into the ‘biosimilar’ category, as it is not simply an adaptation on a current market therapy, but an entirely new design altogether. </SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content" id="please" align="center"><H2>Our Final Project Design</H2><H4>As you can see, developing human insulin as a therapy became a lot more operational and useful following the discussions with Neil, which showed that insulins do not need to be refrigerated to maintain levels of activity.

But ultimately, with the blessings of Dr Peter Arvan, we were able to develop our own Single Chain Insulin, and Len Mancini was able to confirm that our optimised Winsulin is in fact outside of all patent claims.</H4></DIV><DIV class="row" align="center"><DIV class="content" id="please"><CENTER><H1>Applied Design</H1></CENTER></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content" id="please" align="center"><H2>Our Original Applied Design</H2><H4>As technology is evolving faster than therapies can develop, we originally wanted to design an insulin pump to go along with our Single Chain Insulin.

            	Guys, that’s a great idea, but we have GMPs for a reason. Safety is more paramount than simply meeting demand. Regulating something like that would be way more of a nightmare than it’s worth.

                Yeah, we guess you’re right. Recombinant methods of production of an open source insulin seems like our best option moving forward. Market hurdles included! We should probably investigate how an open-source business would function though with a few more experts.

We also decided to model the activity of our Winsulin to determine what kind of insulin it is. This will also be important information for future endeavours. Furthermore, we became a little more comfortable with the idea of going open source with our Winsulin also. However, these talks also demonstrated that raising the initial capital for manufacturing plants may be a little difficult given the start up costs, specifically Good Manufacturing Practice approvals.</H4></DIV><DIV class="row" align="center"><DIV class="content" id="please"><CENTER><H1>Entrepreneurship</H1></CENTER></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content" id="please" align="center"><H2>Our Original Entrepreneurship Plan</H2><H4>Originally, we were full steam ahead on the open source direction.

            	In order to make a global impact, you really need to build a business around your products, patents and all. Raising funds will be a lot easier when you start a start-up in conjunction with us, as many businesses with much less appeal have made millions of dollars after just a few years here.

                Wow that’s amazing! It would definitely be easier to raise the funds as a company.  Much of the price of insulin comes from manufacturers and patent holders adding huge mark ups on the product that the governments and consumers then must face. If we were to design a business, obviously we wouldn’t impose those kinds of mark ups.

            	Hey guys, slow down a little. Discovering promising compounds is only one step in the process. It is the in-human trials that are needed to convince regulators the drug should be registered that is the real challenge for open source drug development. How are you going to fund that? If you want to get a drug to market entirely open-source without industry involvement you will probably need to consider “open source clinical trials”, and organise a network of people that are willing to do the necessarily research on a non-profit basis.

                We hadn’t considered that. I guess that we need to think about all the potential options for funding that doesn’t necessarily involve us making it directly to fund the project.

            	You should also start thinking about how the initial manufacturing plant begins. If I were you, I’d find a country that has a high demand for insulin and is currently very undersupplied. Build your plant there, following the regulatory guidelines required for that country. Once your Human Insulin production starts making a profit, you can begin phasing in your Winsulin. Get Winsulin off the ground with your human insulin production.

 				This might be a nice way to start. We currently have a large amount of processes that we have to go through in order to transport insulin from one country to another. Custom imports are different between countries, some of which are time and resource intensive to manoeuvre through. Localising your operation in one location may be a better way of organising this before expanding.

            We have had huge demand for insulin in Tanzania in Africa. Their diabetic population is quite large and is expected to grow significantly as better diagnostic tools are implemented, as estimated 2/3rds of their diabetic population are currently undiagnosed in Africa alone. The South East Asian, and Pacific rim regions also need to be closely monitored.

            	So, maybe Tanzania or somewhere similar would work? You should strongly consider forming a start-up, and withhold Winsulin from the open source sphere to pursue this. Global impacts require profit margins and intellectual protection.

Although, these discussions really made us question as to whether the Open Source option really was our best option, especially noting the clinical trial costs and manufacturing barriers to enter the market. Following this discussion, we decided to explore the viability of open-source insulin, comparing them to the standard business model - including the costs / barriers of entry that were involved. The summary of our research can be found on <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/Entrepreneurship">our Entrepreneurship Page</A>. Our decision came down to the open source method to continue with the international collaborations we have developed throughout the year. Further research is also required to determine just how applicable our Winsulin is as a therapeutic agent, so keeping the research open to the international community means theres more opportunity for this research to occur. Since our project began as an open source collaboration with <A href="http://openinsulin.org/">Open Insulin</A>, we decided to continue sharing the work we have done on both human insulin and Winsulin.</H4></DIV><DIV class="container_babe-fluid"><DIV class="row content" id="please" align="center"><H1>Profiles</H1></DIV><DIV class="row content" id="please" align="center"><DIV class="col-xs-6"><H1 href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/nicholas.coleman.php">Dr Nicholas Coleman</H1><H4>Our PI and primary mentor, was the first to instigate the project through his relationships with members of Biofoundry.
