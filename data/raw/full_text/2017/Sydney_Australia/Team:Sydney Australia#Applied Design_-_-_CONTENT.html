For type I diabetics, who must take insulin every day to survive, and roughly 30% of type II diabetics, this issue constrains their quality of life. Worse still, diagnosis of diabetes is on the rise. Currently 92% of the insulin market is produced by 3 pharmaceutical companies. In economics, this kind of market share is called an oligopoly. In these kinds of markets, generic or biosimilar insulins have a hard time breaking through, simply due to the enormity of market share that the other three own. To make things just a little more difficult, clinical trial expenses and regulatory licensing means that very few small to medium sized manufacturing plants can enter the market. Because of these constraints, the insulin market has spiraled out, and as such, insulin is largely unaffordable and inaccessible across the board.</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="content" id="please" align="center"><H1>Potential Solutions</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="please" align="center"><DIV class="content"><DIV class="col-xs-4"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-6"><DIV class="small"><H6 style="font-size:1.5vw"><B>1.

Recently, there has been a calling for an open source insulin pump which is universal to all insulins. [1] Furthermore, continuous glucose monitoring in the cloud has recently become an open source system, could be integrated in with the insulin pump to remove the day-to-day stress of blood-sugar control.[2]

This could fall under a normal grant scheme, or through newly designed investment schemes for insulin specifically. This could be further enhanced by creating investment initiative programs, such as ‘matching’ any investment an ‘Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient’ manufacturing plant makes. Currently the expense to get a manufacturing facility GMP approved is prohibitive for small-medium sized business, and a major dissuader for large corporations. The Indian government has done an excellent job of lowering this barrier to entry without compromising on product safety.[5]
In addition, the expense of operating in the American market results in pharmaceutical companies ameliorating these expenses across global sales, resulting in a far higher global price. Medical advertising reform in the USA/Europe would significantly reduce the price burden on the international market. 
The managers of pharmaceutical benefits schemes can decide how large portions of the market directs its spending. Companies go to significant advertising expense to ensure their analogue is purchased in bulk. Insulin expenses are a public burden as well as an individual financial burden. By directing spending towards regular insulin/ open-source analogues, this public burden can be reduced. [6]

Importantly, in improving the situation of inaccessible insulin to different countries, public investment appears to be the most effective and efficient way of reducing costs to diabetics. Although this method is clearly beyond our reach and relies on governmental reform; we investigated the role of current government practices in insulin subsidisation from different demographics. The full analysis of how different government schemes (as in 6 of the potential solutions graphs) is below on the clickable world map.
Focusing more on solutions which are accessible to us, we thus prioritised an open-source business model that aligned with an overarching aim of maintaining an international collaboration and keeping our data and findings free to be used. </H4><H4>To see the full thought process taken to reach the conclusion we have, please visit our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sydney_Australia/HP/Gold_Integrated">Integrated Human Practices Page</A>. Various stakeholders invested great time to help guide us towards our solution: </H4><H3>Open Source Insulin Producing Bacteria with simplifed purification</H3><H4>An overall theme from above is simple upfront costs. The best way for us to help in reducing these costs is not so much approaching it through an avenue that tries to remove those costs all together, but in a way where we provide a cheaper alternative once certain costs are made. For example, rather than going through the litigation process of reducing the costs of Good Manufacturing Practice approval processes, or by investing into creating a new trading platform for public investment, we are providing a simple to produce insulin for up and running manufacturing plants to take on, or for manufacturing plants to be developed to produce these insulins. 
We have specifically designed our expression systems such that there are three locations where the insulin will be accumulated. In E coli, we have insulin being accumulated in the cytoplasm and periplasm. In Bacillus, we hope to be able to purify straight from the media from secretory accumulation of Insulin. Through these methods we should be able to compare easily which worked, and which didn’t, and then the associated purification methods which simplified the process. 
Furthermore, we have designed our own single chain insulin to help remove a lot of the post-purification methods associated with getting insulin into its active form. A series of di-sulphide bonds make it quite difficult to fold properly within bacterial cells. On top of that, for Proinsulin to become Insulin,  the C-chain must be removed. So, we’ve designed a single chain insulin with a small C chain linker which doesn’t need to be removed, and should also position the A and B chains more favorably to form the di-sulphides correctly.  
Our solution is  by no means in isolation of other options also. Further down the track, following scaling up our production schemes, considerable efforts will be put into developing an open source pump to go alongside the insulins we have developed. Further efforts will then be put on to manufacturing contracts with medium-large scale plants to start pumping insulin out globally. On the side, efforts will also be put towards developing a gene therapy to ultimately cure diabetes in the mean time.

We took data from government sources which outlined how much they subsidised an insulin vial, and insulin prices of one specific analogue were found in each respective country. Household income distributions were also collated from government statistical departments. Major difficulties were found in collecting data, especially in countries that do not publicise income distributions. Insulin prices were also hard to find, which we attributed to the fact that its a prescribed item.  
Our results found that even without insurance coverage, Australians were able to afford insulin across more income percentiles than Americans. In Australia however, all residents are able to receive subsidised insulin. This takes all insulin prices down to just $AUD25 per month. In the USA by contrast however, you must be aligned with a certain insurance company which subsidises the insulin brand you require. Therefore, insurance premiums and rates must be paid in order to subsidise insulin. Due to the amount of variability in insurance premiums, no per month cost could be determined for US residents.

Enormous effort and expense is required in order to gain marketing traction with the medical advisory boards that direct spending within the industry. While not technically corruption, this market inefficiency accounts for an enormous portion of the pharmaceutical cost equation - expenses that must be made up for through increased prices. 	The Insulin Analogue/ Biosimilar market is just one example of how this artificial price can negatively affect patients.
Gabriella is allergic to the kind of insulin her insurer covers at a $25 out-of-pocket cost. She can only take Apidra, but her insurance only covers 25 percent of the price, leaving the family to pay hundreds of dollars a month they can't afford.[13]
Even considering the low minimum wage - $25 a vial is an affordable shelf price for Regular Human Insulin, so the USA gets a pass on this one. The NBC article also describes ‘black market’ trading of insulin vials, however this is just further evidence of market inefficiencies creating artificial price rises. Certain insurance companies will only cover certain insulin analogues, and consumers must turn to the internet to find an affordable alternative if an allergy prevents them from using the single subsidised brand. This has little in common with the true black-market insulin available on websites such as AliBaba which comes from anonymous suppliers and may be a sole lifeline for individuals in developing nations. 
It is difficult to estimate the spillover effect of the USA’s bloated pharmaceutical industry on the global price of insulin. Certainly, it is the same three companies supplying the majority of the world. They will naturally attempt to spread the incidence of their costs in America, despite the significantly lower purchasing power of these international customers. Coupled with a lack of institutional insurance or pharmaceutical benefits schemes, these secondary markets struggle to meet their national demand for insulin analogues.
Potentially as a consequence of this demand deficiency, Regular Human Insulin is routinely undersupplied in the global market. One would typically expect generic manufacturers to meet this lack, however sufficient supply has not manifested itself in most countries.[14]
    </H4></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-6"><H4><B>Figure 3.</B>Pharmaceutical companies find themselves in a prisoner’s dilemma, common in oligopoly markets. Opting to increase advertising expense prompts competitors to do the same, resulting in little change in market share. However failing to respond to competitors’ can lead to a significant loss in market share. Generally the only way to rectify this without industry collusion is through government intervention with legislation that caps advertising expenditure.[15]
</H4><H4><B>Figure 4.</B>It is fair to say that corporations should be able to recuperate R&amp;D costs through an exclusionary patent that provides the holder with a temporary monopoly. Unfortunately, the convoluted American medical system can increase this cost by an order of magnitude or more. It is incorrect to blame the pharmaceutical companies for this situation - as they are merely individual agents attempting to maximise their profits in a limited market. The only solution is market reform.[16]

However unlike the USA, Canada has a public health care system.
Despite this, 57% of Canadians do not follow their doctor prescribed therapy because they cannot afford medications, devices and supplies. There is a high variability in out-of-pocket expenses across the nation, with different jurisdictions offering different subsidies based upon income level. The highest burden of Diabetes rests on the lowest income Canadians, which the study recommends reforming; “People with type 2 diabetes with incomes of $30,000 pay more as a percentage of both their annual and family income than those who earn $43,000 and $75,000.” [27]</H4><H4><B>Figure 10.</B>The Canadian government’s report recommends rapid reform of the Diabetes rebates - and unlike it’s developing counterparts, has the public finance to carry this out.  However, throwing more money at the problem without tackling upstream inefficiencies in manufacturing/distribution will not solve the problem. [27]
    An alternative, fiscally-efficient methodology would be to invest public finances in local insulin manufacturing facilities. The lack of intellectual property protection on Regular Human Insulin would allow for the Canadian government to limit the effect of the supply constraint, while boosting local industry and reducing out-of-pocket costs for Diabetics. </H4></DIV><DIV class="col-xs-6"><H4><B>Figure 11.</B>The burden of Diabetes disease management rests most heavily on the poorest Canadians, costing an average of 17.7% of individual income for those who earn less than CA$15,000 (with an insulin pump). On Prince Edward Island (PEI), poor citizens can expect to fork over nearly 40% of their individual income to pay for diabetes management with a pump. Comparing this with 10% of income on PEI for management without a pump elucidates a major challenge faced by low-income Diabetics in developed nations.  Extensive advertising expense is paid to educate health professionals and advertise to the decision makers in government to ensure the status-quo is advanced insulin pumps that only function with an expensive insulin analogue. 
Better control of blood-glucose and a low-input regime should not be locked behind a paywall that excludes the majority of Diabetics on the planet. There exists here an excellent opportunity for open-source science to provide an insulin pump that provides CGMitC (continuous glucose monitoring in the cloud) and is capable of dispensing a variety of Regular and Analogue Human Insulins.

Socialisation of the health care expense reduces the cost burden to the individual, and also creates a clear image of the “societal cost of Diabetes.” Rather than extensively examine the shelf prices of insulin in various EU countries, it is more important to observe the public expense that Diabetes treatment incurs. Pharmaceutical benefit schemes will often offer only one insulin brand, greatly increasing the taxation burden due to the non-competitive market. Furthermore, a lack of competitive pressure can keep prices artificially high, beyond the reach of poorer nations.[25]<UL><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">Survey Quotes:[10]</LI><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">France:“There is no insulin shortage in France despite many patients so I guess it's not hard to obtain it”</LI><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">Netherlands:“I have no problems getting insulin, getting enough test strips to measure blood sugar levels is way more expensive”</LI><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">Spain: “The doctor gives us prescriptions for a year and we simply have to go to the pharmacy to pick them up. $17 euros a month”</LI><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">Denmark: “It is very easy, Danish hospital system.</LI><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">Denmark: “It is easy because we live in Denmark = Novo Nordisk and good health care”</LI><LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">Germany: “For free with a prescription in a pharmacy (paid by health insurance)”</LI></UL></H4><H4><B>Figure 8.</B>There is a high variability in the treatment cost of diabetes even within the European economic zone.

The rapid growth in the insulin market can be attributed to improved healthcare, diabetes awareness and the changing lifestyle conditions associated with prosperity. Further directed national investment could set the Chinese market on the path towards insulin independence, and eventually China may become a net exporter of the drug.[17]</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content-IND"><CENTER><H2>India - Developing Nation, Very High Public Healthcare Expenditure</H2></CENTER><DIV class="row" id="please"><DIV clas="col-xs-6"><H4>Insulin in India is heavily subsidised by the government, however this comes with a significant drawback.  The public burden for insulin subsidies in 2016 was 4.7x the allocated budget and growing at a rate of 20-30% per year.  
Brand name insulin is virtually unaffordable for the majority of the 60+ million diabetics in India. [20]
Of the government response, a study by the Lancet says; &quot;Substantial attention has been given to the issue of access to medicines for communicable diseases; however, access to essential medicines for diabetes, especially insulin, has had insufficient focus.&quot; [20]
Advertising to doctors by major pharmaceutical companies encourages the use of a multiple-insulin regime, despite the additional expense this engenders.

One possible strategy for protecting and encouraging local industry would be to set a maximum price on insulin within the Indian market. 
As described by Wockhardt Chairman Habil Khorakiwala;<I>“Domestic companies make investments in the country and build facilities and the government is favouring multinationals by giving a higher price to imported products. They are enjoying huge premiums.&quot;</I>[22]

When available, the subsidised price is 500 Philippine Pesos (~$US10). For many in the market, this simply hasn’t been an option until now. It is likely the government can’t afford the expense to expand access. Otherwise more work needs to be done to raise awareness of the program and the possibility of switching insulins. [23]
The Philippines is expected to have one of the highest rates of newly diagnosed diabetics by 2025, prompting the government to investigate further options. The national insurance system does not allow comprehensive coverage of diabetes management, is only limited to certain household members, and provides limited medication coverage. “Out-of-pocket” health care continues to be the main mechanism of patient–doctor relationship and compensation.[23]
Metformin and sulfonylureas are the most commonly prescribed medications due to their availability and cheaper cost. SciLin R is an available generic from Singapore, but at $262 yearly expense - it is far from the price of generics in other countries.[21] <I>“Even if I have work, it's really a burden for me to buy Insulin because it is indeed very costly. Imagine Lantus Solostar 3mL Pen costs around 850+ pesos and I consume it for only 6 days, Humalog 3mL cartridge I consume for about 10 days that costs 800+ pesos. If I'm going to sum all my expenses on medicines and syringes alone it will cost me around 6,000 pesos a month, that's roughly half of what I am getting from my job, and I still need to pay for the house rent, water, electric and telephone bills and of course my son's therapy and food. I haven't included the cost of blood glucose strips yet, that's gonna be around 5,000 pesos if you test pre and post meals in a month. For an average earner like me, it's gonna be a challenge on how to budget my monthly salary with everything that's coming my way. No wonder some people give up and die from diabetes complications, especially the poor that can't afford to pay for Insulin to live.”</I>[24]<I>“Humulin N is 1,345 pesos in Drugstores and I got it for 413.40 pesos only because of the Insulin Access Program of DOH.

Crucial medications such as insulin are transported to the Central Medical Store, where they are distributed to those who can afford treatment or are lucky enough to come under the umbrella of a charitable organisation. [29]<LI style="font-family:'Quicksand';color:#3e3f3f;">“ Ludovic Festo, the young man being treated for diabetes at Mwananyamala Hospital, pays 10 000 Tanzanian shillings (US$ 5) a fortnight for his insulin</LI>
Diet and lifestyle changes are major contributing factors to the rise in diabetes prevalence inside the nation, but so is greater awareness and improved diagnosis. Dr Mavura Nurdin, head of the Diabetes clinic, says; 
“We have 7 000 patients at Mwananyamala Hospital alone. We don’t always have enough medicines for all of them, so when we run out, we tell the patients they need to go and buy their insulin in a pharmacy, and pay the full price.” [29] 
The Tanzanian government is currently working to implement a national healthcare system that takes contributions from citizens relative to their personal income. Ideally this would reduce dependence on other nations, but it will not affect the local price of insulin. [29] 
Another problem stems from ‘counterfeit’ insulin (and other medications), as it can make the patient even more sick and directs them away from actual medication. The lack of government resources to invest in large-scale manufacturing makes Tanzania an ideal location to attempt the ‘bathtub insulin’ business model - however, as discussed elsewhere, this would be a regulatory nightmare.
Once again, the burden of action lies upon the Developed world to introduce efficiency into the manufacturing chain of this essential medication.

Insulin administration supplies and Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (US$696.78 per patient, per year) accounted for 52.82% of these total costs.” [30] Furthermore, the one Brazilian respondent to our survey stated; [10]<I>“No estado onde moro no Brasil o acesso público ao medicamento é relativamente fácil.

To save money, these individuals may use their supplies inappropriately (e.g. they may reuse disposable supplies, use lower doses of medication or perform SMBG less often than recommended by clinical diabetes monitoring and treatment guidelines).”  [30] In addition, the authors suggest another very real danger implicit in patient’s spending so much on supplies; “more money is being spent on SMBG supplies than on physician and dietitian consultations and nurse counselling. These findings point to the need to pay greater, more logistical and financial attention to the integral health assistance model, which involves investing in a multidisciplinary team and focusing on health education and on the rational and effective use of the procedures and technologies available.”  [30] High insulin costs don’t just undermine the ability of diabetics to treat their condition, they also undermine the very medical industry that attempts to protect those with Diabetes.</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content-AUS"><CENTER><H2>Australia - Developed Nation, High Public Healthcare Expenditure</H2></CENTER><DIV class="row" id="please"><DIV class="col-xs-6"><H4>Australia has one of the world’s most well funded ‘Pharmaceutical Benefit Schemes’ - which ensures cheap medication at the cost of an exacerbated tax burden due to the non-competitive market.

Similar to Australia, NZ’s PHARMAC is a pharmaceutical benefit scheme that reimburses a significant portion of medication cost to the consumer - shifting the cost to the taxpayer. 
In a statement inviting public comment on the usage of biosimilars, PHARMAC notes the advantage they might provide: “Biosimilar competition for insulin glargine presents PHARMAC with an opportunity to reduce the costs of insulin glargine and improve health outcomes for New Zealanders.” 
Figure 12: While the cost per vial of Insulin glargine to PHARMAC is not readily available, the use of biosimilars can offer the New Zealand Government a significant reduction in expenditure.
