BASIC PARTS
Our basic parts are the fundamental bricks that make up our composite parts, and include regulatory regiongs such as an efficient ribosome binding site, tags for modifying production of proteins of interest, such as affinity chromatography tags and tags for a variety of translocations within various cell types. They also contain the primary protein coding regions that we studied in this project – Human Proinsulin (BBa_K2417006) and Winsulin (BBa_K2417007) .

PART NAME
SOURCE
DESCRIPTION
 
 
BBa_K2417004
 
Glycine Glycine Serine (x4) Linker Motif A
 
 
Designed
·      Linker motif used   to provide spacer region
·      Used to expose   affinity purification tags such as 6x His tag
·      Serine and glycine   used as they are small and flexible
 
 
 
BBa_K2417006
 
 
Human Proinsulin Coding Sequence
 
 
 
Humans
·      Coding sequence for   human proinsulin, sourced from NCIB
·      Consists of A, B   and C chains, but C-peptide is cleaved out
·      Contains 3 disulphide bonds
·      Contains arginine   residues adjacent to C-peptide to allow cleavage
 
 
BBa_K2417007
 
Winsulin - Single Chain Insulin Analogue
 
 
Designed
·      Consists of short linker peptide instead of C-peptide
·      Does not require cleavage therefore simplifies production procedures
·      Linker peptide raises pI of insulin analogue (long lasting after administration)
·      Increased thermostability (based on other single chain insulin analogues tested)
 
 
BBa_K2417008
 
6x Poly-Histidine Tag codon optimized for use in E. coli
Designed (optimized for use in Escherichia coli)
·      Codon optimized for use in E. coli
·      Used to immobilize ions on a chromatography affinity column (nickel, cobalt or copper)
·      Small, and easy to add to the ends of proteins of interest
BBa_K2417009
Extended ribosome binding site
 
 
T7 major capsid protein
·      High ribosomal recruitment efficiency
·      Sourced from the pET15b vectors
 
 
BBa_K2417010
 
 
Ecotin Periplasmic Signal Peptide
 
 
Escherichia coli
·      Small periplasmic, homodimeric protein
·      Upon fusion to N-terminus of protein will translocate protein to periplasm of E. coli
·      Periplasm is an oxidative environment ideal for protein folding, and simplifies extraction due to eliminating the need for purifying inclusion bodies from the cytoplasm
·      Periplasm has reduced proteases
 
BBa_K2417011
 
 
YncM Bacillus Secretion Peptide
 
 
Bacillus subtilis
·      Can be fused to the   N-terminus of proteins to induce secretion to the surrounding media wheN proteins are expressed in Bacillus subtilis
·      Eliminates many   steps in the purification process
 
 
BBa_K2417012
 
 
 
TEV Protease Cleavage Sequence
 
 
N/A
 
 
·      Sequence for which TEV protease is specific to
·      Can be added between protein of interest and peptides that require removal, such as purification tags
 
 
BBa_K2417013
 
Glycine Glycine Serine (x4) Linker
Motif   B
 
 
Designed
·      Linker motif used   to provide spacer region
·      Used to expose   affinity purification tags such as 6x His tag
·      Serine and glycine   used as they are small and flexible
