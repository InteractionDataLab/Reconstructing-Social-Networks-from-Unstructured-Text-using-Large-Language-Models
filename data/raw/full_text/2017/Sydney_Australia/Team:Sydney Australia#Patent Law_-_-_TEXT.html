Aim
In constructing the sequence of a single chain insulin we had to ensure that our sequence was not under any existing patents so that we could submit our sequence into the Open Source iGEM registry. With a bit of help from Maxwell Lawyers we went through several single chain insulin patents, method patents and existing patents for current insulin dispensing devices/therapeutics using the FDA orange book. The goal was to make sure our work did not come under any existing patents so we would not infringe any ownership rights.
Importantly, we recognise the difficulty of being thorough with all existing patents and the content provided is not intended to be legal advice and should not be used as such. To determine whether you are infringing a patent; the best course of action is to seek a qualified patent lawyer.
To examine the way we approached patents - please click on the links below for easy navigation to each section.
How to read a patent
After our chat with Uppsala (check it out in collaborations ), our team realised that patents are a very poorly understood area, particularly for young aspiring scientists with new and challenging ideas.
With a resident legal student in our team - we created a quick checklist on How to read a patent
KEY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Patents give an exclusive commercial right to the invention aka. a monopoly
2. The "claims" of a patent, detail what is covered by the patent.
3. If it is NOT in the patent; it is NOT patentable.
And it is with this checklist that we approached the analysis of a wide range of patents below.
1. Single Chain Insulin Patents
Although our team attempted to be thorough, we recognise that not all patents can be checked. However, we targeted patents with the greatest relevance to avoid legal suits that may arise. Our primary concern was single chain insulin patents since they have only been recently explored in greater depth and quoted to have benefits like enhanced thermostability. As these single chain insulins are likely to be the next insulin product in the market, we wanted to create one, outside the scope of existing patents, to characterise and compare our product.
Importantly there is an exception in patents for research purposes. This means that if the work you performed is for research purposes only, you do not infringe the relevant patent. You cannot however, submit the part into the open source registry or try and commercialise it. As we are submitting 'Winsulin,' our single chain insulin, it must not be patented.

2. Method Patents
In looking at patents, we first considered looking at different methods of production – particularly whether or not Bacillus secretory methods are patented for insulin production.
From a preliminary search, Bacillus secretion has been previously patented however most are now expired. If it is possible to find a patent using the same method of production as a previously patented product, it will not infringe anyone elses intellectual property.

CLAIMS
 
COMPARISON WITH OUR METHOD
Y/N
 
Status: EXPIRED. Now this   patent has expired. Importantly – it   covers our
project as we have a heterologous protein being attached via a secretion tag   to the actual plasmid vector design.
 
Y
 
A method for producing a   heterologous protein in a bacterial host cell such that the protein is   exported from the host cell into the culture medium, the method comprising   culturing in a bacterial culture medium a genetically engineered bacterial   strain containing a fusion DNA sequence which comprises a first nucleotide   sequence encoding at least an N-terminal portion of a flagellin protein native to the bacterial host cell species and a second nucleotide   sequence encoding the heterologous protein, said first nucleotide sequence   being linked via its 3' terminus to the 5' terminus of the second DNA   sequence and said fusion DNA sequence being operatively linked to an   expression control sequence and wherein said N-terminal portion results in   the export of said heterologous protein.
 
 
 
 
Our plasmid falls directly   into this means of production. As this patent has since expired and we fall   under it – the   methods that are encoded are free to be used and thus not for law suit.

CLAIMS
 
 
COMPARISON WITH OUR METHOD
 
Y/N
 
Status: EXPIRED
The expiry date of this patent   is extremely critical as it patents the production of proteins in a Bacillus   cell with multiple gene knockouts. Importantly, the strain used by us, WB800   contains 8 protease knockouts and thus falls within the scope of this patent.   As the patent has expired –this   means of production is available for use.
 
Y
 
Claim 1
A Bacillus cell   characterised in containing a mutation in the epr gene,   said epr gene encoding a protein   comprising the amino acid sequence of Figure 6 or an evolutionary homologue   thereof of other Bacillus species, having protease activity, said   mutation resulting in inhibition of the production by said cell of proteolytically active epr gene   product.
 
We have a mutation in the epr gene in WB800, which renders the EPR protein inactive   such that it does not have a proteolytically active epr gene product
Y
Claim 16
A method for producing a   heterologous polypeptide in a Bacillus cell, characterised in   comprising: introducing into said cell a gene encoding said heterologous   polypeptide, modified to be expressed in said cell,   said Bacillus cell containing mutations in the apr and npr genes,   and further containing mutations in one or more of the genes encoding the Epr protease, RP-I, or RP-II, said Epr,   RP-I and RP-II comprising the amino acid sequences set out in Figures 6, 10   and 14 respectively, or evolutionary homologues thereof of   other Bacillus species, having protease activity, wherein said   mutation results in the inhibition of the production by said cell of proteolytically active Epr protease, RP-I or RP-II.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have a mutation in aprE and nprE and also epr and thus fall   within this claim.

July 3rd, 2001
 
CLAIMS
 
COMPARISON WITH OUR METHOD
Y/N
 
1.     A method for producing a   polypeptide, comprising:
2.   
 
(a) cultivating   a Bacillus cell in a medium conducive for the production of the   polypeptide, wherein the Bacillus cell comprises a nucleic acid   construct comprising a tandem promoter in which each promoter sequence of the   tandem promoter is operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding the   polypeptide, wherein the tandem promoter comprises promoters selected from   the group consisting of the amyL promoter, amyQ promoter, aprH promoter, cryIIIA promoter, subtilisin Carlsberg gene promoter, and consensus promoters of the amyL promoter, amyQ promoter, aprH promoter, cryIIIA promoter, and subtilisin Carlsberg gene promoter having the sequence TTGACA for the “_35” region   and TATAAT for the “_10” region; and
(b) isolating the polypeptide   from the cultivation medium.
 
 
 
We do not have a tandem   promoter series, therefore we fall outside of this   claim.
 
We are also using the … promoter, which is not listed there.
 
We will be cultivating the   medium for polypeptide isolation however.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
N
 
11. A method for producing a   polypeptide, comprising:
(a) cultivating   a Bacillus cell in a medium conducive for the   production of the polypeptide, wherein the Bacillus cell   comprises a nucleic acid construct comprising
(i)   a consensus promoter obtained from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase   gene (amy Q)   or Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase gene (amy E) having the sequence TTGACA for the “_35” region and TATAAT for the “_10” region operably linked to a single copy of a nucleic acid   sequence encoding the polypeptide and
(ii) an mRNA   processing/stabilizing sequence located downstream of the consensus promoter   and upstream of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide; and
(b) isolating the polypeptide   from the cultivation medium.
 
 
 
Arguable – how to define whether the medium we will use will   be ‘conductive’ or not is vague.
 
We are not using a consensus   promoter from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, but are   using the Bacillus subtilis strain. The promoter we have selected is p-Spac
 
We also do not have an mRNA   processing or stabilising sequence in our gblock.
We are isolating our   polypeptide from the cultivation medium.

3. Orange Book/FDA
We also considered patents without single chain insulin to identify whether existing commercial / FDA products involved patented methods eg. storage etc., that may be broad enough to include insulin analogues like Winsulin.
Looking through the Orange Book, a drug database showing all products that have been approved -  including their therapeutic equivalences, our team searched through all 101 entries that involved insulin to determine whether or not we would fall under a patent here.
Search Method
All 101 patents were collated it in an excel data table (right: screenshot of excel data sheet) and formatted with Y/N based on their expiry date. We then picked out all the patents (green) in force and ordered them by their relevant associated patents and their associated claims.
Patent Categories
1. Sequence
2. Device
3. Preparation / Storage
Interestingly, most of the patents for insulin that are still in force, surround the physical devices which are used to inject the insulin eg. automatic injection devices, or alternatively means of storage. This is unsurprising as insulin as a therapeutic has been around for over 50 years.

Biosynthetic osteogenic proteins and   osteogenic devices containing them
both devices and the actual materials - these materials have a   specific sequence and conformation to induce endochondral bone formation when   disposed within a matrix. Own insulin is not synthesised to have that purpose   and although it does have six cysteine residues – the patent covers a very specific   sequence that is longer than our product. Furthermore this patent is only relevant to a pair of polypeptides which is unlikely our   single chain, Winsulin.

The sequence claimed in this patent consists   of Asp(B28) human insulin which we don’t have. Furthermore, it involves the   actual preparation of the “insulin with glycerol and or mannitol and 5-100mM   of a halogen, including chloride and specifically NaCl.”
 
Whilst these are not relevant to us in the   present stages of our projects – they have implications on how we plan to   store the insulin in the future

Similar to above – this involves a storage   patent where a specific human insulin construct (glargine),is preserved in polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80; with at least one preservative and water and a specific acidic pH.
 
Again, this is an important consideration when   it comes to the long term storage of our insulin and   its preparation.

Insulin preparations, which do not contain any zinc or   only a small quantity of zinc and which have an improved stability
 
A formulation comprising at least one   insulin analog; at least one surfactant; optionally   at least one preservative; and optionally at least one of an isotonicizing agent, a buffer, and an excipient, wherein   the pharmaceutical formulation is free from or contains less than 0.4% by   weight of zinc based on the insulin content of the formulation.
 
Importantly, our insulin (at the stage of   our experimental work are currently left in storage buffer

STABLE INSULIN FORMULATIONS
The stable insulin formulation claimed by   this patent involves claim for a stable insulin solution with a
i) physiologically tolerated buffer from the group   of TRIS and arginine, and a
ii) monomeric insulin analogue with human insulin that has a modified B28   position and a modified B29 lysine or proline.
 
Our sequence does not fall under these   requirements in terms of modification and this patent thus would not affect   us
