    •This week the team discussed various insulin analogues on the market as
    well as a new type of analogue which is starting to appear in the
    literature. This ‘Single chain insulin’ keeps the C-peptide incorporated,
    resulting in greater stability.
</DIV><DIV>
    •We also discussed various expression systems for expressing our insulin.
    Steph suggested expressing insulin in yeast. This was thought to be too
    difficult as no one had much experience working with yeast.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Alex referred to several scientific papers that summarised the expression
    of insulin in the periplasm of E.coli - allowing for simpler purification
    of insulin. He also suggested purification using a His-tag fused to the
    protein.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Various assays to test our insulin were compared. We compared antibody
    assays (ELISA), cell culture glucose uptake assays, and an alternative C.
    elegans assay where the bioactivity of the insulin can be monitored through
    phenotype.
</DIV><DIV>
    •The team agreed that we wanted to stay away from mice convulsion assays
    due to ethical reasons.

    •This week, lead by our team legal expert Steph, the team looked at various
    patented single chain and other insulin analogues and summarised their
    features. We also looked through the patents for each of these insulins and
    to determine which features are covered in the patent.
</DIV><DIV>
    •We also discussed expression systems for our insulin analogues. Steph
    suggested using Bacillus subtilis to secrete our insulin if the protein was
    fused to a secretion tag.

</P><DIV>
    •Each member of the team received a free SnapGene license
</DIV><DIV>
    •Our Secondary PI and protein expert, Jacqui Matthews, helped us design our
    own single chain insulin analogue which we called Winsulin.
</DIV><DIV>
    •The team narrowed down our research on insulin analogues and expression
    and finalised which parts we plan to submit into the registry and/or
    express.
</DIV><DIV>
    •We planned to express 3 different insulins: Human Proinsulin, a single
    chain insulin found in a paper called SCI-57, and our own single chain
    insulin Winsulin.
</DIV><DIV>
    •We plan to express each of these insulins in the cytoplasm of E. coli, the
    periplasm of E. coli and to be secreted by Bacillus subtilis.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Our parts each included a 6x His tag for purification. Insulins that will
    be expressed in the periplasm will have an Ecotin ‘periplasmic-expression’
    tag, and insulins that will be to be secreted will be fused to a YncM
    ‘Bacillus-secretion’ tag.
</DIV><DIV>
    •This leaves 9 parts to be designed and synthesised. As a team of 8, each
    team member was assigned a part. Our lab guru Jamie was assigned two of
    these gBlocks to design as he was especially enthusiastic.
</DIV><DIV>
    •We hope to order them next week.

    •The team worked really hard last week to finalise our gBlock parts. Rough

    for E. coli and Bacillus subtilis and restriction enzyme recognition sites
    in our gBlocks.

    •Our PI Nick suggested designing our own E.coli/Bacillus shuttle
    replicative expression vector. However, we do not think that we will have
    time to construct it. This could be a plasmid we design for future USYD
    iGEM teams to construct.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Instead due to time constraints, our B.subtilis expression vector ended up
    being an integrative plasmid called pUS258, designed by Yanwei - a PhD
    student in our lab. Nick decided to use pET15b as our expression vector in
    E. coli.
</DIV><P style="font-family:'Quicksand';font-size:20px;color:#3e3f3f;">
    Human practices:
</P><DIV>
    •The team explored various human practices approaches for the project,
    including researching various charity organisations that focus on insulin
    accessibility that we could get in contact with over the course of the
    project.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Emaleen suggested Health Action International and the 100 Campaign.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Alex suggested getting in contact with Insulin for Life.

    •Courtney suggested contacting the Australian government to discuss the
    Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which currently covers most of the insulin
    costs in Australia.

    •On the 18th of August, Steph participated in a webinar over Skype hosted
    by the Uppsala iGEM team. In this webinar, five teams discussed the ethics
    behind intellectual property and open-source science within the context of
    the iGEM competition.

    •The team continued doing shifts at the JAMS stall at the Australian Museum
    for National Science week.

    •Emaleen and Jamie amplified the gBlock insert in these prepped plasmids.
    The gel showed correct bands following the double digest and PCR with high
    fidelity polymerase, so they were finally sent off for sequencing. We will
    need to re-ligate the other inserts in to pSB1C3 (AGAIN!)
</DIV><DIV>
    •pSB1C3::Ecotin Proinsulin and pSB1C3::Cytoplasmic Proinsulin came back
    with good sequencing results and these parts are now ready for submission

    •Organised a Skype call with Dr David Beran on the 30th August
</DIV><DIV>
    •This week we received advice from the university that we were at risk of
    infringing patents if we went on to express SCI-57 and Winsulin. We
    scrapped any work that had been done with these gBlocks.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Steph came up with a design for ‘Winsulin 2.0’ that would not infringe any
    patents. It was based on the design of Prof. Peter Arvan from the
    University of Michigan. We contacted him and he gave us permission to
    continue working with the sequence for Winsulin 2.0 in an open-source
    setting as he had no patent claims on it.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Courtney contacted a patent attorney, Len Mancini, who works at Maxwell's
    for advice about our newly designed Winsulin 2.0.

    •We performed double digests on the prepped pET15b plasmids from last week
    to verify insertion. We amplified the inserts of plasmids which, according
    to our double digests, contained the correctly sized inserts. These
    amplified inserts were then sent off for sequencing.
</DIV><DIV>
    •In the meantime, we transformed the pET15b plasmids into BL21 cells to
    start expression. These transformations were unsuccessful and will need to
    be done again.

    •Sequencing from last week was entirely bad quality. We determined to send
    off PCRs rather than whole plasmid, so Jamie amplified the inserts in the
    pET15b vector and sent them off for sequencing again.
</DIV><DIV>
    •Courtney also redid the transformations of pET15b-gBlock into BL21, as
    they didn’t work last week. This time we finally got some successfully
    transformed cells!

    •Emaleen performed colony PCR on these transformants and correctly sized
