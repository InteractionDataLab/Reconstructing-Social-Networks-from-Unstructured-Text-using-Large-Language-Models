COMPOSITE PARTS
All of our gold, silver and bronze winning parts are composite parts, consisting of a multitude of basic parts
The complete sequences and characteristics of these basic parts are linked on the Parts Registry pages of our composite parts which are linked in each table.
Best Composite Part
Our best compsite part is our Winsulin (BBa_K2417005) as this part is designed by us (with the help of Peter Arvan and his laboratory) and is also open-source. This part is a single chain insulin which means that there is no extra processing step that must occur to make it functional such as the need to cleave the c peptide in proinsulin to make it functional insulin. This simplifies the production of this insulin. Single-chained insulins are also considered to have greater stability compared to human insulin and other analogues and would therefore be preferable. The Winsulin is also fused to a YncM secretion tag. This tag means that it can be secreted out into the medium that the B.subtillis cells are growing in and would therefore eliminate the extra time consuming and costly step of needing to extract intracellular protein. The His-tag would then allow you to easily purify the Winsulin from the medium with ease.

KEY FEATURES
WHY IS IT GOLD?
YncM-Winsulin
BBa_K2417005
 
Bacillus subtilis (YncM secretion tag)
 
 
Novel short chain insulin   analogue (Winsulin) with a 12AA linker
(-QRGGGSGGGQRR-)
 
YncM secretion tag to   translocate protein into media
 
N-terminal 6x His Tag   purification
 
4x GSS flexible linker
 
TEV protease cleavage site
 
Extended ribosome binding site
 
 
 
We   demonstrated that it works:
·      We tested it in   insulin-sensitive cell lines and saw an increase in glycogen synthesis and   glucose oxidation above basal levels, proving its bioactivity
·      We showed via an   ELISA assay that whilst the cell lysate did not contain Winsulin,   the media in which the cells were growing did. Therefore the YncM secretion tag worked as expected
 
The   results for these assays can be found here
Ecotin-Proinsulin
BBa_K2417000
 
E. Coli (Ecotin tag)
 
 
 
Human proinsulin
 
N-terminal Ecotin tag for targeting proteins to the periplasm
 
N-terminal 6x His tag
 
4x GGS flexible linker
 
Trypsin protease cleavage site   for His-tag and C-peptide cleavage
 
Extended ribosomal binding   site
 
We   improved previous parts:
BBa_M39904 and BBa_M1877 by:
 
Completing their sequence
 
Adding a periplasmic   transporter tag (for more efficient folding in an oxidative environment)
 
Adding an efficient ribosomal binding   site
 
Adding an N-terminal His tag   for purification
 
We   demonstrated that it works:
·      By testing it   insulin-sensitive cell lines and saw an increase in glycogen synthesis and   glucose oxidation above basal levels, therefore proving its bioactivity
