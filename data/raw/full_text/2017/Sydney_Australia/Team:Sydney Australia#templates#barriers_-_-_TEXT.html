Barriers to Entry
Barriers
Click on the Segments in the Pie Chart to learn about the barriers to enter the insulin market.
Technical Barriers to Entry
In the current manufacturing world, recombinant methods are seen as difficult and time intensive. As a result of this, many avoid using recombinant technologies for therapeutic production regimes.
Legal Barriers to Entry
It took our iGEM team a full couple of months before we were comfortable to say that we had a new insulin to add to the market. We were also able to utilize expertise to navigate through the legal sphere, which greatly aided our process. In general though, due to the number of analogue insulins under patent, its very difficult to ‘create’ a new insulin.
Market Barriers to Entry
Every 5 years, the Australian governments Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme undergoes negotiation with the respective manufacturing plants and suppliers to discuss price points for that period.
This system ultimately favours highly established, elite market players with the market scale to supply an entire region.
Cost Barriers to Entry
When people say ‘nothing comes cheap,’ they’re really talking about drug development. To say its expensive really undermines the meaning of expensive. Clinical trials generally cost around US$1 Billion to start with. Production plants for insulin manufacturing can fall anywhere between US$100-$500M, and then a license can cost up to another US$100M. Understandably, these costs limit majority of the wishful market entrants.
