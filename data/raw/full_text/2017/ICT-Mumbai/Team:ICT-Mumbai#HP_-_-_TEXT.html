Overview
From the time we decided to take on the issue of ammonia removal from the environment, our sights were set on designing a portable machine that could harbor our engineered bacteria. We aspire to use this device chiefly for deodorization of public washrooms. Insights from industry experts, academia, our peers and public opinion have played a huge role in shaping up our idea.
Have a look at what we have done by clicking on the buttons below:
Current solutions
Before embarking on our pursuit, we first analysed the current solutions that are available for deodorization of toilets and their short-comings. A summary of our findings is given below:
1) Perfume or Naptha balls: This is the most commonly used method for tackling toilet odour. Perfumes used may vary in price from affordable deodorants to high-end fragrances while naptha balls are usually cheap. They just offer a band- aid solution and tend to fade away with time.
2) Water-less toilets: Water-less toilets though proven to provide odorless sanitation and capable of saving water, come at a steep price. Majority of today's washrooms cannot be upgraded into a water-less facility without making drastic changes, thus limiting its usage.
3) Bioblocks: Bioblocks provide a bio-response that is, they release benevolent bacteria every time they come in contact with urine. The bacteria prevent odour formation in addition to release of a fine fragrance. Their only limitation is the fact that they need to be replaced every few days, making them inconvenient.
Public and educational outreach
Science is all about curiosity and kids are known to be very curious! Hence, sparking scientific curiosity amongst kids has been over main focus. We are thankful to Sparsha Charitable Trust for giving us the opportunity to interact with kids from K. D. Vidyalaya school. In our interactive sessions, we tried our best to convey the sense of biotechnology beginning right from explaining what a cell is, to giving day-to- day examples such as bread, ethanol, and curd production by microbes. This went a long way in clearing a common misconception amongst them that all microorganisms are bad. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the session and we were satisfied that we could introduce them to biotechnology and convert them into science enthusiasts.
Expert advice
In order to make our device suitable for practical use in public washrooms, we consulted Sulabh International, an NGO behind the ‘Sulabh Sanitation Movement’ who have built 1.5 million household toilets & 54 million government toilets around India. According to Mr. Nirmal Singh, President of Sulabh International, Mumbai the device under design by us could one day be used in public washrooms provided it is economically feasible. From above interaction, we got an idea of how public toilets are being maintained and this motivated us to make this process easier and economical.
Survey
Q: Status of these toilets?
Q: Do you use them?
Q: Does public toilet smell deter you from using them?
Q: If we could come up with a solution that eliminates this odor, would you use these toilets?
