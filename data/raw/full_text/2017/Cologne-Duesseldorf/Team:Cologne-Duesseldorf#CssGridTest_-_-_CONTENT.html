          the biggest challenges humanity faces. Their creation is therefore one of the major
          goals in synthetic biology. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in the last
          decade, however, the creation of a fully synthetic cell is yet a milestone to reach for.

          A common approach tries to build up artificial cells from scratch, whereas we want to
          start by engineering artificial compartments through orthogonalization. For designing
          these new compartments we plan to establish an open source toolbox accessible to
          the community at large. This will make it possible to boot up a compartment perfectly
          tailored for a specific application, which will enable cheaper and more efficient
          production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, or high value chemicals.

          By integrating enzymes or biosynthetic pathways into semi-permeable organelles we
          gain higher concentrations of enzymes and metabolites and provide a basis for the
          ideal operation of specialized enzymes. Furthermore, toxic or unstable intermediates
          can be sustained and naturally incompatible reactions can take place
          simultaneously.
          We have chosen yeast peroxisomes as our chassis for designing this synthetic organelle, which are very resistant, have a useful import mechanism and are expendable under optimal conditions.</P></DIV><DIV class="footer"><H1>Footer</H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
