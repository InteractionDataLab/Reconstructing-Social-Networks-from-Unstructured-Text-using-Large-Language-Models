Designing a Customizable Synthetic Cell Compartment Toolbox
Have you ever looked at an airplane and thought about how intricately each part has to be designed to fit into the overall machine?   Engineers have long used the technique of designing, testing and redesigning components of larger machines in order to improve them. Because they understand every detail of the machine they are able to accurately predict the behavior of each part. This has lead to the development of ever-more useful tools.
Every Biologist dreams of being able to utilize this process with the same efficiency. They spend a whole lot of time planning the part and its function in the respective organism. Then they integrate the part and find out that it either doesn't work, kills the cell, or causes unexpected reations. This is because most of the time the organism is not completely understood and there is interference with some part of the natural metabolism. Our aim is to solve this problem! Our team, "artico", which stands for artificial compartments, has created a fully customizable cell compartment toolbox which can be used to create a reaction room inside a cell tailored exactly to the user's needs. Our compartment can import proteins specifically chosen by the user, change its luminal environment as well as its size, and secrete its content to the extracellular medium. It can be used for a wide variety of purposes, be it basic research, compartmentation of toxic metabolic pathways, or even more exotic functions such as in vivo protein crystallization.

Collaboration
We were delighted to meet other teams and collaborate in order to achieve our goals
Human Practices
One of the most valuable experiences of the competition was sharing our project and acquired knowledge with the public . We highly enjoyed inspired conversations about ethical and societal aspects of synthetic biology, organizing our own SynBio conference , and starting a worldwide postcard campaign !
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
In addition to engaging with the public, we expanded our Human Practices by investigating both ethical and scientific issues, opportunities and limitations of our projects. Meeting experts from both international laboratories and companies as well as representatives from ethical references centers, we were happy to integrate their valuable feedback into our lab work!
Model your project
Prior to conducting experiments about enabling full control over the peroxisomal protein import we predicted the structure for the yeast peroxisomal matrix import protein using AMBER and VMD. Additionally, we modeled the nootkatone pathway to optimize our proof-of-concept and show the advantages of cellular compartmentation using python.

Results
Achieved
We were able to design and successfully test an orthogonal peroxisomal protein import mechanism for peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae
By decorating the peroxisomes with the v-SNARE Snc1 we successfully secreted their entire contents
With two different sensors we were able to efficiently measure the pH and the redox potential inside our yeast peroxisomes
Via fluorescence microscopy we verified that the integration of new membrane proteins into the peroxisomal membrane is possible
By successfully translocating the required enzymes for the metabolic pathways of Nootkatone and Violacein into the peroxisome and actually synthesizing the latter, we developed a proof of concept for our toolbox
We successfully implemented a way of customizing the size and number of the peroxisomes into our toolbox
With a high throughput assay we characterized the import efficiency of different PTS2 sequences
To get a better understanding of possible problems and pitfalls of our metabolic engineering concepts we extensively modeled the whole nootkatone pathway and the benefits of it being translocated inside our compartment
For our planned optogenetic experiments we designed an affordable lightbox which can easily be assembled in a short time
All our excellent results can be combined into a highly variable compartment toolbox for designing artificial compartments based on the peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae with an enormous range of applications
