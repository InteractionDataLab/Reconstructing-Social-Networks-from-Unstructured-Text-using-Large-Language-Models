We are proud to improve roGFP(BBa_K1093013) of Team iGEM13_Warsaw with our part (BBa_K2271024).  In order to use the redox sensing in vivo sensor we optimized it for our application in yeast. Carboxyl terminal fusion of the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) resulted in small areas with high fluorescence intensity inside the cell - proven to be peroxisomes . In contrast, cytosolic fluorescence was nearly silenced. The Pex5 receptor recognizes the signaling tag PTS1 and ensures the import into the peroxisome, which is shown in the following figure.
Right: localisation of roGFP2 into the peroxisomes, Left: wild type control
Expression of our level2 plasmids containing both, a sensor and peroxin13 mRuby, a peroxisomal marker, showed co-localization which leaded to yellow spots in merged channels et al., (2009) .
Right: peroxin13-mruby and cytosolic expressed roGFP2, Left: PTS1 tagged roGFP2 co-localized with peroxin13-mruby
We successfully validated roGFP2 and conducted calibration and in vivo measurements.
