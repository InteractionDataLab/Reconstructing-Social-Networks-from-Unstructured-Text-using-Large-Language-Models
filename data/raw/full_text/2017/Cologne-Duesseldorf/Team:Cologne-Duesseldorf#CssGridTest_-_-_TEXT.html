Designing a Customizable Synthetic Cell Compartment Toolbox
Synthetic organisms provide a wide range of applications with the potential to tackle           the biggest challenges humanity faces. Their creation is therefore one of the major           goals in synthetic biology. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in the last           decade, however, the creation of a fully synthetic cell is yet a milestone to reach for.            A common approach tries to build up artificial cells from scratch, whereas we want to           start by engineering artificial compartments through orthogonalization. For designing           these new compartments we plan to establish an open source toolbox accessible to           the community at large. This will make it possible to boot up a compartment perfectly           tailored for a specific application, which will enable cheaper and more efficient           production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, or high value chemicals.            By integrating enzymes or biosynthetic pathways into semi-permeable organelles we           gain higher concentrations of enzymes and metabolites and provide a basis for the           ideal operation of specialized enzymes. Furthermore, toxic or unstable intermediates           can be sustained and naturally incompatible reactions can take place           simultaneously.           We have chosen yeast peroxisomes as our chassis for designing this synthetic organelle, which are very resistant, have a useful import mechanism and are expendable under optimal conditions.
