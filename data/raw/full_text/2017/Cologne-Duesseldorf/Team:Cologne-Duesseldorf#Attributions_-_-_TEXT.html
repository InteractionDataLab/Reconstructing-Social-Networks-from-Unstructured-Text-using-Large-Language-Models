This year’s iGEM competition has been an exhilarating, instructive and absolutely nerve-wracking experience. A team of 24 students from two different cities got together to create a new milestone in synthetic biology. At the end of this year we are happy and more than proud to look back at everything we have achieved as a team. However, none of this would have been even imaginable without the amazing support of all the people who accompanied us throughout this year. Therefore, we are dedicating this part of our wiki to all the special people who helped us realize our project, no matter if it was with their technical support and knowledge, infrastructure, or organization.

Help and Support
Principle Investigators
Prof Dr. Matias Zurbriggen (Institute for Synthetic Biology, HHU), our primary PI, who supported our team in getting started this year and helped us find a suitable and realizable topic. Furthermore, he provided us with theoretical knowledge and valuable input regarding our project during weekly meetings with our three team representatives. He also provided us with chemicals and consumables, whenever something was missing in our lab.
Prof. Dr. Gunther Döhlemann (Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology, UzK), one of our secondary PIs, who provided our team in Cologne with a lab to work in as well as equipment and consumables. Furthermore, we would like to thank all members of the institute for their assistance with experiments.
Prof. Dr. Andreas Weber (Institute for Plant Biochemistry, HHU), our secondary PI from Duesseldorf. For the second time he was a great mentor and contact person for many aspects of our project. He played a big role in helping us find our topic, supported us with valuable theoretical knowledge as well as organizational issues, especially regarding the planning and implementation of our SynBio conference.
Organization
Dr. Martin Mauve (Dean, HHU) for providing our team with a common room to work in. Furthermore he approved a generous financial grant from the Heinrich Heine University.
Brigitte Haumann (CEPLAS, HHU) for being our team’s guardian angel. She helped us with the entire organization of the project outside of lab, including fundraising and financial administration, registration, booking flights (and amending the booking multiple times) and a lot more. Most of all we would like to thank her for her moral support and her undying iGEM spirit.
Dr. Stefanie Zeretzke (UzK) for administering the project in Cologne, including dealing with all bureaucratic problems, finances and general administration.
Infrastructure
Prof. Dr. Markus Pauly (Institute for Plant Cell and Biotechnology, HHU) provided our team with an entire lab in Duesseldorf. Furthermore he more than generously supported us with all the equipment and consumables we needed for our work.
Prof. Dr. Stanislav Kopriva (Botanical Institute, UzK) supported the team with work space in his laboratory as well as chemicals and equipment.
Prof. Dr. Michael Feldbrügge (Institute for Microbiology, HHU) for his general advice and for constantly providing us with lab equipment whenever required.
Prof. Dr. Ilka Axmann (Institute for Synthetic Microbiology, HHU) for her help in building the new iGEM team and choosing this year’s research topic.
Prof. Dr. Peter Westhoff (Vice President for Research and Technology Transfer, HHU) for generously providing us with fund to get set up for this year's competition.
Prof. Dr. Lutz Schmitt (Institute for Biochemistry, HHU) for his generous financial support.
Prof. Dr. Thomas Klein (Institute for Genetics, HHU) for providing us with a dark room for our optogenetics experiments.
Prof. Dr. Thomas Langer (Institute for Genetics, UZK) for providing us with funds to set up the laboratory in Cologne.
Technical Advice
Dr. Nicole Linka (Institute for Plant Biochemistry, HHU) for her invaluable advice on working with peroxisomes. She invested a lot of time and effort into sharing her knowledge and pushing our project forward.
Prof. Dr. Ralf Erdmann (Systems Biochemistry, Ruhr University Bochum) and his colleagues for taking the time to introduce us to working with peroxisomes and providing us with knockout strains we needed for our project.
Jun.-Prof. Dr. Oliver Ebenhöh (Institute for Quantitative Biology, HHU), MSc. Nima Saadat (Institute for Quantitative Biology, HHU) and Prof. Dr. Holger Gohlke (Institute for Pharmaceutical Chemistry, HHU) supported both, our modeling and hardware teams with expertise and materials, especially in 3D printing and modeling.
