More specifically, we found some interesting features about crocodiles antimicrobial peptides because they have a wide range of action, efficiently killing all kinds of bacteria.</P><H2>February 16th</H2><P>After focusing on them, the next question was to find whether they were safe for humans. 
      </P><P>
After verifying this important characteristic, we came up with a first device idea, a concrete application for our idea. It is a <B>bacteria-containing-bandage</B> able to produce the peptides. A great advantage would be for it to produce the peptides only upon detection of a pathogen to avoid the overproduction of them. Thus the idea would be to design a bacteria able to <B>detect and kill a pathogen</B>.</P><H2>March 9th</H2><P>Another problem appears: this kind of bandage has already been made in a previous iGEM competition, we need to find a more innovative solution.

Thus we chose this bacterium as our pathogen of interest. Bacteria can be detected by other ones thanks to the quorum sensing machinery. The combination of the needs of a prokaryotic detector and an eukaryote producer led us to a major innovation, the creation of an <B>eukaryote-prokaryote</B> communication to create a <B>multimicrobial system</B>. This synthetic communication does not exist in nature and made us wonder about our responsibility creating such a system. We had  a deeper understanding in our reflexion about the implications of creating a new type of collaboration.</P><H2>April 6th</H2><P>Our idea was to create a device shaped like a cocktail shaker, containing engineered microorganisms system.

Thus this population knows the symptoms and reacts to the first ones. The infected patients immediately seek the care of NGOs. These NGOs are then able to cure them quite efficiently and to curate the infected well. Some people still die from cholera when they are particularly old or young, or when it takes them too long to reach help. </P><P>After these explanations it appeared clear that <B>no diagnostic system</B> is required. Furthermore, large-scale water treatment installations already exist in cities and our solution wouldn’t be competitive. A <B>small, portable, convenient device</B> seemed more relevant, to treat water in remote areas. </P><P>Finally she said that the population takes all the measures to prevent the tourists from being infected to avoid a negative publicity, this <B>called our project aiming for tourists into question.</B></P></SECTION><SECTION id="step-4" class="step-descr"><H1>4 - Contextual setting on the cholera living cycle</H1><H2>June 20th</H2><P>

He depicts us a worrying situation in Africa : nowadays, epidemic peaks are frequent during the dry season, while it was unthinkable few years ago. This situation is alarming because NGOs can’t predict when epidemy will occurs, that makes more and more difficult the management of the disease outbreak. Multiplying <B>prevention activities</B> on hygiene, NGOs are trying to stop the epidemic has its origin. In the case of an endemic country, NGOs use to come every rainy season : all the villages are attached to a health center, but the personal representative came rarely into remote areas because of the <B>lack of personal</B>. In the case of emergency, NGOs sometimes uses small water stations near rivers. </P><UL><LI>Advices about our project Croc’n cholera</LI></UL><P> As the DWB regional manager we’ve meet, Alama pointed out that the best way to fight against a cholera epidemic is by <B>giving to the population the mean to prevent themselves</B> against the disease at home. In this matter, our device Croc’n cholera is a good system to treat water. </P><P>Alama told us that NGOs won’t distribute GMOs products because when NGOs will have no control on <B>potential misuse of the population</B>, for example it will be problematic if people discarded the membrane containing GMOs anywhere. So if we want to use this system in the real life, it would be necessary to educate the population on what kind of product it is and how to use it.

This is associated with a higher concern about this problematic for people over 30.  People are ok with the use of GMOs to treat water, especially the ones with a scientific background, which underlines that education is of the essence in the GMOs perception by the general public. The survey also provides interesting elements about the design our device, and subsequently, of our global strategy (from GMOs use to merchandizing).
