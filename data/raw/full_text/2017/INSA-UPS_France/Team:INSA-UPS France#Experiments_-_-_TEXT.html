Experiments Overview
This Realisations section describes all our wet lab work, based on our strategy. We divided this section into the Clonings page and the Results page : the first shows how we integrated the parts of our Design into our chassis, and the second shows the experiments we did to further validate their functionnality. Both are presented for each of our eight modules:
1 - Mimicking Vibrio sp. presence with an engineered E. coli 
We engineered here E. coli to mimic for safety reason the presence of Vibrio species.
Cloning: successful
Validation: in progress
2 - E. coli producing C8-CAI-1 molecules can be sensed by V. harveyi 
In this module, we created synthetic communication between our engineered E. coli and V. harveyi.
Cloning: No cloning for this module
Validation: successful
3 - Modification of V. harveyi to detect both C8-CAI-1 and CAI-1
Here, we present our first effective modification of V. harveyi and its perspectives for the project.
Cloning: successful
Integration in chassis: not done yet
Validation: in progress
4 - Establishing production of diacetyl to establish communication between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
This module is dedicated to the production of diacetyl by bacteria, as a signal relay toward yeast.
Cloning: successful
Integration in chassis: in progress
Validation: in progress
5 - Diacetyl detection by Pichia pastoris 
This presents are modification and first assays to engineered P. pastoris for diacetyl detection.
Cloning: successful
Integration in chassis: successful
Validation: successful
6 - P. pastoris is able to produce functional antimicrobial peptides
Finally, this module described the efficiency of a yeast-produced crocodile AMP on V. harveyi.
Cloning: successful
Integration in chassis: successful
Validation: successful
7 - Co-cultivate P. pastoris and V. harveyi  is possible
Toward a realistic solution, we tested here how to co-culture our microbial consortium.
Validation: successful
8 - Membrane permeability assay
We assessed the capacity of our microorganism-impermeable materials to let AMP go through.
Validation: successful
