What if they could communicate?
The living world offers a lot of possibilities, but their use is still limited in synthetic biology.
Our idea is about taking advantages of the characteristics of single microorganisms by making them communicate with each other to get the appropriate response.
Our proof of concept : a fight against cholera
V. cholerae is responsible for cholera, a disease that contaminates water and affects people in developing countries, war zones and natural disaster zones.
Our project is about creating a multi organisms system which is able to sense and wipe cholera out in contaminated water.
