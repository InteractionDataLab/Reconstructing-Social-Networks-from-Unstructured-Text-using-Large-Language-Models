        For the nine of us, iGEM is the biggest project we’ve ever been part of. Yet, as dedicated and hard-working as we are, our Croc’n Cholera project wouldn’t have been possible without all the help we received. We feel blessed thinking to all of the people that advised, supported and believed in us, whenever we needed help (some of them literally came at our rescue!). We believe that talking to so much people from so many backgrounds really represents the iGEM spirit. Let’s call this our personal little reward.  
      </P><P>
        For all of you who helped us throughout this awesome adventure, thank you very much!
      </P></SECTION><SECTION><H1>General acknowledgments</H1><P>
        First and foremost, we want thank our amazing PIs and all of our instructors who followed us relentlessly from the beginning to end : brainstorming, designing, experimenting, writing, presenting,... Basically all the aspects of our project!
      </P><UL><LI><B>Stéphanie Heux</B></LI><LI><B>Brice Enjalbert</B></LI><LI><B>Pierre Millard</B></LI><LI><B>Régis Faure</B></LI><LI><B>Anthony Henras</B></LI><LI><B>Yves Roméo</B></LI><LI><B>Florence Bordes</B></LI><LI><B>Cédric Montanier</B></LI><LI><B>Marie-Pierre Escudié</B></LI><LI><B>Yoann Louis</B></LI></UL><P>
        When you work on a scientific project, it’s better if you can go and experiment in a lab... We would like to thank the <B>Biochemical Engineering Department of INSA Toulouse</B> for letting us use the their labs the whole summer, with all the basic equipments.  
      </P><P>
        Basic equipments are awesome, high tech ones are even better! That’s why, we want to thank the <B>LISBP</B>, along with the <B>MétaToul</B> and <B>GeT-Biopuce</B> technological platforms for letting use their efficient (and expensive!) technological resources : NMR analysis, nano-dropping, lyophilizer, etc. 
      </P><P>
        For the same reasons, we want to thank the <B>LBME</B> for letting us use their lab for some important experiments (RTq PCR is the best!).
      </P><P>
        Finally, we would like to thank those who was here before us, members of the <B>2016 iGEM Toulouse Team</B>, for advising us with their own experience.
      </P></SECTION><SECTION><H1>Wet Lab helps</H1><P>
        The first to enter the show is <B>Sylvie Cancel</B>, one of the Biochemical Engineering Department technicians of INSA Toulouse. Her help was incommensurable in the lab. She always tried to fix every little problems that we had. Also, we would like to thank her colleague <B>Yves Dutruy</B> for his help about basic equipments.
      </P><P>
        We couldn’t work on vibrios without contacting <B>Bassler Labs</B>. We would like to thank them for kindly giving us two strains of <I>Vibrio harveyi</I> : the WT BB120 and the mutant JMH626.
      </P><P>
        Thanks to a conference on <I>Pichia pastoris</I>, we come to know <B>Diethart Matanovich</B>. Many thanks to him for all the advice he gave us on this lovely yeast.        
      </P><P>
        Also, we want to thank <B>Marc Carnicer Heras</B> for giving us one of his strains of <I>P. pastoris</I> (SMD1168).
      </P><P>
        You don’t transform <I>V. harveyi</I>, you conjugate it. We want to thank <B>Céline Loot</B> for advising us with conjugation mysteries. 
      </P><P>
        On the same topic, <B>Matthieu Arlat</B> was also a great help. Many thanks for his help on conjugation protocol and for giving us conjugation plasmids : (pBBR1MCS-4, pBBR1MCS-5) and for the <I>E. coli</I> helper strain containing pRK2073. 
      </P><P>
        And as we needed to work on <I>E. coli</I> first, thanks to <B>Sylvie Reverchon</B> for giving us the plasmid pBR322.
      </P><P>
        We want to thank all the researchers, technicians, PhD students of the LISBP, who helped us during our experimentations:

        </LI><LI><B>Mickaël Dinclaux</B> for giving us 1000X M9 salts aliquots, we couldn’t make some as good as yours.
        </LI><LI><B>Mickaël Castelain</B> and <B>Nicolas Dietrich</B> or helping us dealing with diffusion experiments with our prototype, scientific field remaining quite a mystery for us.
        </LI><LI><B>Sandrine Laguerre</B>, our own goddess of statistic, who helped to pull relevant data out from our survey.
        </LI></UL></SECTION><SECTION><H1>Humans Practices Supports</H1><P>To begin with, we want to thank two amazing people for their deep involvement in our human practices strategy: </P><UL><LI><B>

          Marie Pierre Escudié</B> who knows how to use her great human sciences knowledge to build strong integrated human practices analysis. Did you know that ethic and matrix could be used in the same sentence?</LI></UL><P>
        Then, we want to thank members of the NGOs Doctors without Border and Unicef. Thanks to the help of <B>Claire Salvador</B>, <B>Francisco Luquero</B> and <B>Alama Keita</B>, we’ve been able to fully understand the current situation of the fight against cholera.
