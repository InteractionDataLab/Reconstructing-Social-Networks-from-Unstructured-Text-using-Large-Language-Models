Model driven optimization
Our mathematical model was usefull to modify different parts for the project, following an iterative approach. Predictive results of modeling were used in our wet lab strategy (see Choice of the best antimicrobial peptide), and, in turn, experimental results helped us to improve the model (see Experimental results for modeling). Finally, modeling was an efficient tool for rational design of the device, as data from modeling were essential for this aspect of the project (see Device design).
