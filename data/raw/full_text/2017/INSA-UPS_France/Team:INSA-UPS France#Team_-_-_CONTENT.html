          With her incredible amount of knowledge in biology, Margaux is the one who first lead us through the crocodile’s world. She is the ears and voice of the team, always cheerful when a skype is planned with another team… and very calm in front of communication technology mysteries (“Can you hear us??”). Last but not least, Margaux is definitely the queen of the cell schemes on the wiki!

          Leïla studies biological engineering at INSA Toulouse. Think about her as a real biology lover, singing lullaby to her transformants and amazed by organisms as weird as <I>Crepidula fornicata</I>. Straightforward, she will always tell you what’s in her mind, but without changing her usual calm voice. One last thing: don’t even think disturbing her during her daily nap after lunch ;)

Léo hasn’t slept since the 25th of January, official date of the team creation. While he feeds us with tofu, we are all getting a hard time to feed him data for his modelisation.

          Able to stay amazed 5 minutes in front of fungi growing on a petri dish, Marie is especially in love with <I>Deinococcus radiodurans</I>. Besides, she is a true hard-worker, she already stayed in the lab until the night (midnight?) to transform her cells. She is our public engagement enthusiast, always coming up with original ideas to show that microbiology is a fun field!

          Téo is our lab director, meaning that he supervises the experiments! Need any advice? Come talk to him, he will help you with his great lab experience. Always singing, smiling and believing in our cloning strategies, he is the optimistic strength we needed in our team… except the tragic day when he spill all his miniprep tubes.

          In the lab, Margaux never goes anywhere without her notebook, writing everything in it. Her personal globetrotting experience was a great help to organize our trip to Boston: Airbnb and Air France have no secrets for her! She is also our reference for the ravishing tongue of Shakespeare, she will be fluent in no time.

          Anna builds the wiki with a lot of hard work, strong efficiency and a great sense of design, fueling herself with her secret coffee recipe. Even if she is an informatician, she fell in love with minipreps, analytical digestions and agarose gels, and became a great molecular biologist! She even integrated the biologist’s humor, and always finds a way to refer to an enzyme or a plasmid. Now, she can switch from one field to the other as easily as on her rollerskates.

          He works hard with treasury and sponsoring to fund our project, and suffer chronic heart failures whenever he hears: “we need to buy another enzyme”. He is also our hero: with him, our lab stays a clean and tidy place! He comes to master our vintage autoclave pretty well. We’re still trying to locate his home, somehow lost in the countryside...

          Paul is responsible of Integrated Human Practices and Registry. Usually located in the ethidium bromide room, being in contact with this dangerous molecule gave him supernatural powers: he has successful cloning with strange methods, and has a special talent for ethical considerations. Ethidium bromide also transformed him into a fun facts machine, but these facts will be kept confidential...

His precious help in model and experiments during the project could be sponsored by his local bakery, because he ate one &quot;religieuse au chocolat&quot; (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/c/ca/T--INSA-UPS_France--Religieuse.jpg">a french pastry</A>) during each iGEM meeting, which led to more than thirty pastries for <I>Croc'n Cholera</I>!

Florence was the first to gain from the students the name of &quot;tata flo&quot; (means aunty flo) this kind of surname gained a great popularity during the 3 month of experiments. Thanks you Tata Flo &lt;3

In particular, he is interested to better understand how spatial proximity and modularity within enzymes impact hydrolysis of such complex polysaccharides.
Cedric’s presence on iGEM meeting is correlated with an extension about 30% of the time of discussion.
