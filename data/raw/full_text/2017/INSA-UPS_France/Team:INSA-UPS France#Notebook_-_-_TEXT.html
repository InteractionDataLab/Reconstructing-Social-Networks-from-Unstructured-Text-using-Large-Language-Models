Week 3
Our team was being recruited. Nothing happened this week!
Week 4
01-25: Kick Off Meeting
Gathering the team members and distribute the tasks... The adventure begins!
Week 5
01-30: 2th brainstorming: on the track of crocodile antimicrobial peptides...
We’ve took charge of differents accounts of the association (facebook, twitter, email, bank account, google drive…), and made a listing of 45 potential subjects for the competition.
Week 6
02-06: 3th brainstorming meeting
We’ve selected 17 subjects that we considered the most originals, the most feasible, and the most interesting. We’ve imagined to make a dressing against nosocomial infections containing bacteria that produces antimicrobial peptides from crocodile. We’ve read that crocodile peptides are not toxic for humans at microbicide quantity.
Week 7
02-16: 4th brainstorming
Only 7 subjects left! To make a safe device, we’ve thought of switch on the dressing by using spores that can be activated with the temperature.
02-13 to 02-17: Training course for INSA students at LISBP with our instructor Brice Enjalbert
Week 8
02-23: 5th brainstorming
We made a list of our public engagement events. For our subject, we’ve focused our research on the originality, and we’ve noted that a similar dressing has already been made by an iGEM team before. So we imagined the use of anticoagulant molecules in the dressing. We’ve thought of a bandage for pets.
Week 9
03-02: 6th brainstorming
We’ve analysed the 7 subjects, and we’ve noted some technical issues. For the “crocodile peptides project”, we’ve raised several questions : what organisme should we use to produce antimicrobial peptides? We need to find an organism which is not susceptible to their antimicrobial activity. We need to use a special membrane to contain GMOs inside the dressing and not directly in contact to the skin.
Week 10
03-05: Team building at the restaurant
Our team met for the first time outside the INSA buildings and shared a delicious korean meal after brainstorming the whole afternoon!
03-09: 7th brainstorming meeting
We’ve voted for our 4 favourite subjects : “crocodile antimicrobial peptides”, “bioluminescent living board”, “expiration pastille”, and “colourful cellular cycle”.
Week 11
03-12: Brainstorming in a café
03-14: 8th brainstorming
The problem of originality persists for the application: what about a suture thread? For the peptide-producer microorganism, a yeast could be a good solution because the antimicrobial activity of our peptide is bacterial-specific. For the activation of the peptide production, we’ve thought about lyophilisating the engineered yeast.
Week 12
03-21: 9th brainstorming
In view of what has already been done in iGEM for  detection of quorum sensing molecules, it seems that we’ll need a bacteria to detect other quorum sensing molecules because it’s difficult to express a prokaryotic membrane-receptor into a yeast. So we’ve imagined a system with a prokaryote that detect a quorum sensing signal from a pathogenic bacteria, and that triggers peptide production by a yeast.
Week 13
03-26: Brainstorming in a café
03-30: 10th brainstorming
A second device is born: a shaker containing our too organisms (prokaryote-detector and yeast-peptide-producer) to detect and kill Vibrio cholerae in the water. We had a idea for our public engagement project: creating a pedagogic card game about microbiology. MicrobioWorld conception is in process...
Week 14
04-06: 11th brainstorming
Dropping of the first device because ALS detection of one single Staphylococcus aureus is going to be difficult. In contrary, Vibrio cholerae produces a high quantity of CAI-1, a specific quorum sensing molecule, at pathogenic quantity.
04-07: choice of the subject
We’ve finally choose to work on cholera water treatment using a prokaryotic-eukaryotic communication.
Week 15
04-13: 12th brainstorming
Actual solution to fight against cholera are not sufficient to prevent great epidemics, we need to contact NGOs to benefit from their experience of the field of a cholera epidemy. For the proof of concept, we need to find an effective cholera detector, and a good peptide producer. The detector bacteria could be E. coli, or maybe V. harveyi, that already possess the quorum sensing receptor of CAI-1, and all the proteins to do the phosphorylation cascade in response of CAI-1.
04-10 to 04-14 Training course for the UPS students at LBME with our instructors Anthony Henras and Yves Romeo
Week 16
04-19: Meeting with Marc Lemonnier, CEO of Antabio
We met Marc Lemonnier, founding CEO of ANTABIO: a start-up that develops novel therapies to treat drug-resistant infections by the most critical Gram-negative pathogens. This was our first meeting within the Entrepreneurship part of the project. The aim was to learn about the approach to follow to start a business and to have a first external opinion regarding the integration of our biological system into the market. You can read the result of his testimony here.
04-20: 13th brainstorming
We’ve found a company called “Sunwaterlife” that work on water treatment by filtrating water in Toulouse. We’ve planned to meet them to take advices from their experience, and ask if they could help us to build our device to contain GMMs into a membrane to avoid their dispersion into the environment. For the peptide-producer yeast, we’ve selected Pichia pastoris, famous for it’s capacity of fast production of proteins. To make a communication between our two organisms, we’ve thought of using diacetyl: our detector organism produces diacetyl in response of CAI-1 detection, that triggers AMP by P. pastoris.
Week 17
04-23: First drafts of Sobki, our mascot!
04-25:
Following our appointment with Marc Lemonnier, we began to think about a device so that our system could treat the water in a tank for villagers or the water of a flask for the tourists. The challenge is to confine the microorganisms so that they do not go into the water.
04-26: 14th brainstorming
For safety reasons we can’t use V. cholerae for our proof of concept, and we can’t use any gene from that bacteria. As V. harveyi is genetically close to V. cholerae but not pathogenic for human, we can use it’s quorum sensing molecule, the C8-CAI-1 that looks very much as the CAI-1, to mimic V. cholerae. Here, the idea is to engineer a bacteria to be a “cholerae-like bacteria” that produces a lot quorum sensing molecules to be detected by our detector V. harveyi.
04-27:
Téo and Margaux went to a conference about V. cholerae to learn more about genetics of that bacteria, and the main differences between V. cholerae and V. harveyi.
Week 18
05-02: 15th brainstorming
We need to evaluate the volume of water to treat. In the case of our device contain 1L water, it’s for only 1 person but we can imagine to treat a high volume for an entire village. We’ve prepared a list of questions to ask to NGOs to make a user friendly device.
05-07:
We’ve met 2 game designers and graphists students, Vincent and Julien, to help us in the conception of our card game about microbiology! They will make the graphism designs of our card game.
Week 19
05-11: 16th brainstorming
For the detection of diacetyl, we found the receptor Odr10, that activate the promoter pFUS for peptide production. For diacetyl production, the gene ALS is known to enhance diacetyl production, so we’ll need to express ALS gene in V. harveyi only when C8-CAI-1 is detected. This is complicated because the receptor of C8-CAI-1 induces a repression of the promoter pqrr4. We need to find a inhibitor regulation in our system.
05-13: Paul & Margaux officialy joined our team!
Week 20
05-17: 17th brainstorming
We planed to do NMR analysis to detect C8-CAI-1 and diacetyl for the proof of concept. We’ve asked to Bassler’s lab to give us 2 V. harveyi strains: a WT one, and the JMH626 strain deleted from the gene CqsA, which can’t produce C8-CAI-1 by itself. We’ll need that strain to detect C8-CAI-1 from our engineered “E. coli cholera-like”. Purified diacetyl has been commanded to do induction experiments on P. pastoris. We find the Tet on/ Tet off repression system for diacetyl production in response to C8-CAI-1.
05-18: iGEM distribution kit received
05-21 Sobki is born!
Week 21
We made a survey about cholera disease and about our project to know if people are aware of cholera epidemics in Africa and the existing solutions, and to know if people would be ready to use a device containing GMMs to treat the water they drink.
05-25: Parts design day at Brice's
Week 22
05-28: Official announcement of our subject
We officialy the subject of our project on social media!
05-30 and 31: Exposciences
We took part to “Exposciences” which is a scientific festival. During this event we made children extract banana DNA thanks to simple ingredients that they can find in their kitchen. We also discussed with them about microorganisms thanks to paper fortune teller and this support led them to be curious on the microscopic world around them.
06-01: Interventions in schools
The main goals of these interventions were the discovery of biology and research at school with two workshops: Microorganisms and their environment and growth of microorganisms on a Petri dish.
Experiments

Week 23
06-06: Meeting with the CEO of Sunwaterlife
We presented our project to Christophe Campéri-Ginestet who seems to be interested, especially by the detection function of V. cholerae. He would like to adapt it to the Sunwaterlife filters in order to have a direct colored response according to the water contamination. In addition, he would be willing to invest in our project in order to apply for JEI status (or “Young Innovative Enterprises” in english), a very interesting status for start-ups allowing them to have financial advantages. Besides, a collaboration is discussed so that Sunwaterlife provide us with their membranes, allowing us to confine our microorganisms within a device. He told us that he might be able to put us in touch with a UNICEF person in charge of cholera epidemics.
You can read the result of his testimony here.
06-08: 18th brainstorming
We’ve divided the subject in 3 modules. The “Quorum” module, with E. coli engineered to produce C8-CAI-1; the “Detection” module, with V. harveyi engineered to detect C8-CAI-1 and produce diacetyl in response; and the “Killing” module with P. pastoris engineered to detect diacetyl and produce crocodile AMP in response.
06-09: Intervention in school
The main goals of these interventions were the discovery of biology and research at school with two workshops: Microorganisms and their environment and growth of microorganisms on a Petri dish.

Digestion BamHI/NheI to check jmp62-YFP gel migration profile
Week 25
06-19: Meeting with Doctors Without Borders, regional manager
She explained that the detection of cholera in the patient is simple because the symptoms are known. She told us that our system would be more useful treating water tanks in villages far from cholera camps rather than tourists. Indeed, governments often hide epidemics from tourists and tourist places take enough precautions to avoid tourists’ contamination.
You can read the result of her testimony here.
06-23: Beginning of the marketing approach
A marketing approach has been initiated to study the strengths and weaknesses of our two potential products and to determine the approach to sell them. Thanks to a SWOT analysis on both products, we realized that the product to treat water in a flask is not adapted to the market. This product is therefore abandoned and we focus on a product that processes a larger volume of water, suitable for villagers in the affected countries.
06-22 Skype with NUS iGEM team
06-23: 20th brainstorming
Meeting with all the team members and supervisors and final choice of the global device purpose: made for people living in remote areas in Africa, which are far from NGOs camps and more vulnerable to a cholera epidemy.

Week 26
06-26: Skype with the iGEM team of Purdue
06-28: Meeting with the CEO of Sunwaterlife, building a collaboration
Really interested in the ability to detect V. cholerae in water, Christophe Campéri-Ginestet asked us to provide our bibliographic research and results at the end of the iGEM project. In addition, in exchange for our financial investment in our project, we have to fill out the JEI document which attests to our R&D activity for Sunwaterlife. He also put us in touch with Alama Keita, cholera leader of UNICEF in Niger. Finally, we talked to him about our product to contain our microorganisms. He helped us to design a cylindrical device whose sections would be these membranes to ensure GMMs containment.
You can read the result of his testimony here.
06-30: First steps of our ethical matrix
06-29: 21th brainstorming
We choose to made a Prezi for the presentation in Boston, the structure has been validated by instructors and students, and we made a first version of our poster for the meetup in Delft. Our wiki is online next day! Our survey has around 400 answers, so we can start analyses of results.
Experiments

Cloning
PCR of DsRed and YFP with primers containing restriction sites. PCR products for these genes have right size. PCR products are purified.
PCR of our parts (cOT2 ; leucrocine ; DNY15; Odr10) from IDT GBlocks. All PCRs succeeded.
cOT2 ; leucrocine ; DNY15 ; Odr10 were digested BamHI/BglII to be inserted in pPICZα.
Transformation of pPICZα-cOT2 ; pPICZα-leucrocine ; pPICZα-Odr10 and pPICZα-DNY15 in E. coli DH5α
Miniprep of liquid culture transformants
Digestion BmaHI/BglII to check the gel migration profile.
→ It appears that the plasmid was well digested but the insert does not appear. There is an intense band around 1300bp that might correspond to supercoiled plasmid. To conclude it seems like pPICZα closed itself without the insert: BamHI and BglII are compatibles.
New primers were ordered replace by PCR the BglII site by KpnI site to remove the possibility for the plasmid to close itself.
Week 27
07-06: 22th brainstorming
We’ve prepared some public engagement events for september : an exhibition at the campus science in Toulouse to showcase ancient iGEM Toulouse projects, and synthetic biology, a practical work in an high school, and we’ve planned to participate to the “European Researcher’s Night” with the LISBP by creating a game called “Possible or Impossible”, to open a dialogue about GMO legislation with people.
07-07: Delft European iGEM Meetup
Experiments
Cloning VhCqsA
Optimization of PCR cycle
Cloning of VhCqsA into pSB1C3 : positives clones grew 
Assembly of V. harveyi gene circuit : continuing the sub-cloning work
Assembly of V.harveyi gene circuit: Analysis of the transformants of V.harveyi module (attempt #1 and #2) by checking of the restriction map.
New attempt (attempt #3) to sub-clone Vh1, Vh2 and  Vh3 in their respective vector.  
Cloning
While waiting for the new primers, another try was made using for the ligation a 1:10 ratio (pPICZα:insert).
Transformants appeared in all plates except for Odr10.
Miniprep and digestions of transformants to check the gel migration profile.
We obtained 2 clones pPICZα-DNY15. The gel confirmed that D1 and D2 are clones with the entire plasmid pPICZa A open only in BamHI site with one insert in this site. D1 has the insert in the good direction and D2 has the insert in the opposite direction.
Clones D1 and D2 were stored in glycerol.
At the end of the week, PCR with new primers containing KpnI instead of BglII were made for all the parts (cOT2 ; leucrocine ; DNY15 ; Odr10). All the PCR worked perfectly, PCR tubes were pooled. Odr10 has secondary products which need gel extraction.
Digestion of plasmid and parts with KpnI and BamHI
Week 28
07-13: 23th brainstorming
Citation from Cédric : “we must be humble before molecular biology”. Our card game conception progressing well! We find a name : MicrobioWorld, and the main rules has been determined after several crazy gameplay!
07-14: Meeting with Doctors Without Borders, cholera specialist
Fransisco Luquero assured us that the current solutions (bleach, boil water) were not the most suitable to treat water from cholera. Our device could be interesting if it is suitable to treat several liters of water and even if it contains GMM, it could be easily accepted by the population as long as it does not change the color and taste of water.
Experiments
Assembly of V. harveyi gene circuit : continuing the sub-cloning work
Assembly of V.harveyi gene circuit: Analysis of the transformants of V.harveyi module (attempt #1 and #2) by checking of the restriction map.
New attempt (attempt #3) to sub-clone Vh1, Vh2 and  Vh3 in their respective vector.  
Cloning
Ligation and transformation of pPICZα-cOT2 ; pPICZα-leucrocine ; pPICZα-Odr10 and pPICZα-DNY15.
Miniprep of transformants and gel migration were made. The ladder was clear but there was no DNA on tranformants colums.
Nanodrop analysis showed that there was not enough DNA.
→ The hypothesis is that the liquid culture was too long so E. coli lost the plasmid.
Experiments with P. pastoris
We did plates of YPD with increasing concentration of zeocin to select P. pastoris clones which integrated the most copies of the construction.
Preparation of competent yeast (Pichia pastoris)
Digestion of D1 clone (pPICZα-DNY15) with HindIII to integrate the plasmid construction at the AOX1 promotor in P. pastoris genome.
Electroporation of competent yeast with the digested DNA.
Week 29
07-17: Model

07-20: 24th brainstorming
We’ve finished a first version of our presentation, which will be presented during the Parisian Meetup. The Matlab programming is done, the next step is to add values from bibliography.
07-20: First meeting with Pierre-Alain Hoffmann
We met Pierre-Alain Hoffmann, Deputy Director of CRITT Bio-Industries for the business plan elaboration. The knowledge in creation and development of companies of Pierre-Alain Hoffmann allowed us to understand the goal of a business plan. He accompanied us in this approach, explaining the points to be detailed in order to better integrate our system in the market.

This time lot of DNA was digested.
Several strategies were tried to obtain pPICZα-cOT2 ; pPICZα-leucrocine  and pPICZα-Odr10 with DHAα and XL1 Blue strains.
At the end of the week we got 2 clones of pPICZα-Odr10 in E. coli DHAα
Experiments with P. pastoris
The supernatant of P. pastoris containing the DNY15 gene was extracted and then concentrated via rotavapor and freeze-drying.

Cultures in BMMY adding methanol every 24h for 120h were made for both pAOX1-leucrocine and pAOX1-cOT2 P.pastoris clones. Half of each supernatant was stored at 4°C and the other half was evaporated to concentrate 10 times.
Week 39
09-27: 31th brainstorming
We’ve started to make rehearsals for the presentation in Boston.
09-29: European Researcher's Night
We’ve been to the European Researcher’s Night, a major scientific event that gather researchers and general public in a convivial atmosphere. In 2017, the topic of the event was “Impossible”. In order to follow this thematic, we chose to focus our workshop on the incredible features of biodiversity, how to use it in synthetic biology, and what are legal limits on GMO use in France.
Experiments
Observation by microscopy of V. harveyi (rfp) transformant
Ligation of pBBR1MCS-4 and Vh3 at 16°C overnight, and transformation in competent E. coli (Stellars)
New cytotoxicity tests on petri dishes were made with the leucrocine and cOT2 supernatants. This time with appropriate discs. Positive control did not work again.
New cytotoxicity tests on petri dishes were made but using pure chloramphenicol. A weak halo was seen. We found out that the V. harveyi strain we used to do cytotoxicity test was maybe! the JMH626 one which was chloramphenicol-resistant.
RT-PCR experiment was made.
To test the Odr10-RFP system and activate pFUS, nitrogen depletion cultures were done and two sources of nitrogen were tested: sulfate ammonium and glutamine. The fluorescence following was made in a plate reader.
New cytotoxicity tests on petri dishes were made starting from a fresh V. harveyi cuture. Leucrocine, cOT2 and D-NY15 (40g/L and 50g/L glucose) productions were tested. Halos are clearly visible for D-NY15 40g / L not concentrated and concentrated 10 times.
A 24 well plate was launched by adding leucrocine, cOT2 and D-NY15 supernatant to V. harveyi cultures in exponential phase.
Week 40
10-02: Meeting with Pierre-Alain Hoffmann, director of CRITT Bio-industries.
Between these two appointments, we have elaborated the business plan ourselves. Pierre-Alain Hoffmann read it and made a feed-back. He was pleased with our work, ensuring that some start-ups do not start their business with such a business plan.
10-05: 32th brainstorming
Rehearsals, and writing of different pages of the wiki.
10-04: High school practical work
