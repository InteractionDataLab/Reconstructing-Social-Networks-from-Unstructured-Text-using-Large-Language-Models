<partinfo>BBa_J04450</partinfo>: RFP coding device
Figure 1: BBa_J04450 biobrick conjugated in Vibrio harveyi.
BBa_J04450 was tested in the Vibrio harveyi background. The biobrick was cloned in a broad host range plasmid (pBBR1MCS-4) and conjugated into Vibrio harveyi to demonstrate the production of RFP in this chassis.

<partinfo>BBa_K431009</partinfo>: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (pGAP)
Figure 2: construction to characterized BBa_K431009.
In this part encoding sequence of D-NY15 was placed under the yeast constitutive promoter pGAP. This part was characterized by RT-qPCR.

<partinfo>BBa_K1800001</partinfo>: alpha factor secretion signal
Figure 3: construction to characterized BBa_K1800001.
The Î±-factor sequence contains a kozak region and a signal sequence to secrete the produced peptides. The functionality of the signal factor was investigated by demonstrating that AMP are present in the supernatant using a toxicity assay.

Pichia pastoris complete module with reporter gene : Odr-10 diacetyl receptor (<partinfo>BBa_K1072010</partinfo>), pFUS1 (<partinfo>BBa_K1072023</partinfo>)
This part includes Odr-10 receptor under the control of pGAP, a constitutive yeast promoter. When diacetyl binds to Odr-10 a cascade of activation of Ste proteins (endogenous to P. pastoris ) will lead to the binding of Ste12 on pFUS1 promoter, and the expression of RFP should be activated.
This system allowed to produce RFP in response to diacetyl.
This construction was cloned in pPICZalpha yeast vector.
