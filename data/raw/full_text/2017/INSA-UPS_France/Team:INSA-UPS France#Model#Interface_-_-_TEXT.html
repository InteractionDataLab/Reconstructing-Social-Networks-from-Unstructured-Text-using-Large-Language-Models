Model interface
When developing and analyzing our model, we noticed that a Matlab platform and significant knowledge in informatics and mathematics were needed to use the model, modify it, and run analyses. To make this accessible for everyone, we thus decided to develop a user-friendly web interface. The current interface, developed in Javascript, allows users to vizualize the system dynamics for different values of the two key parameters we have identified: the initial concentrations in Vibrio cholerae and Pichia pastoris.
This interface should work on computers, smartphones and tablets thanks to the use of responsive design technology (though this could not work optimally on all the systems). Future developments of the interface could be envisaged, such as adding other input parameters to tune. Overall, our first version remains an easy way to use our model, which can be exploited further in the “Application” part of our project.
You can easily play with our model below. Enjoy!
