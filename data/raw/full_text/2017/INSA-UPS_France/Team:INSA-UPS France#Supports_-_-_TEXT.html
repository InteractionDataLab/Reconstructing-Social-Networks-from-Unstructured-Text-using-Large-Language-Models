Our institutions
With its roots dating back to the former University of Toulouse, founded in 1229, Toulouse III – Université Paul Sabatier was officially created in 1969 by merging the former Faculties of Medecine, Pharmacy and Science. Today, the Toulouse III - Université Paul Sabatier is one of the leading universities in France, renowned for its scientific influence, the diversity of its laboratories, and the courses it offers in the fields of science, health, sport, technology and engineering.
With 14,000 alumni, INSA Toulouse is an international, multidisciplinary, state engineering school recognized for the excellence of its five-year curriculum. Created in 1963, it has made a priority out of developing its international dimension as INSA Toulouse has worked to attract many foreign students and developed international programs. Aside from training engineers, its mission includes developing ongoing training, scientific research as well as its valorization, which is why it offers research masters and PhDs.
INSA Lyon is a leading engineering school with strong humanist values that have formed the basis of its business model for more than 50 years. Created in 1957 by philosopher Gaston Berger and Rector Jean Capelle, INSA Lyon is the oldest and largest of the six schools making up the INSA Group. INSA engineers lead careers built around a logic of high adaptability, a pioneering approach to science and technology, and a strong sense of social responsibility. This hallmark of the INSA Lyon model is a living tribute to its two founders. It is to them that we owe the humanist commitment of the INSA schools, and their openness to different origins, cultures and social backgrounds.

LISBP (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologique et des Procédés)
LISBP is multidisciplinary (microbiology, biocatalysis, bioprocesses, separation techniques…); it works on uniting Systems Biology, Processes and Engineering, and has a triple engagement centred around Research, Training, and Transfer and Exploitation. With the ambitious aim of federating competence “from gene to process” while combining scientific excellence with economic and social pertinence, LISBP is crossing divisions, applying a multi scale strategy, and building networks in the local and international environment.
MetaToul (Plate-forme de Métabolomique et Fluxomique)
MetaToul is the Metabolomics and Fluxomics Platform of Genotoul, an organization that coordinates all life sciences research platforms in the Région Midi-Pyrénées. It brings together expertise and means (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS)) in the field of global analysis of metabolism. MetaToul provides to the scientific community the concepts, tools and methods related to these kind of analysis at the level of a biological system (cell, tissue, organism).
Toulouse White Biotechnology
Toulouse White Biotechnology (TWB) is a preindustrial demonstrator whose goal is to speed up the development of industrial biotechnology by facilitating exchanges between public research and industry. It contributes to the expansion of a bioeconomy based on the use of renewable carbon in the fields of chemistry, materials and energy.
By creating its partnership foundation in 2009, with the support of France's largest companies, INSA Lyon demonstrates the quality of relations it has developed over the years with its economic partners, and positions itself clearly in a strategy of corporate cooperation. From 2010, the INSA Lyon foundation and one of his main economic partners, the Biomerieux compagny, allows us to give life to our projects and to place us among the best competitors on the international scene of synthetic biology. So it is together again with theses unshakeable partners that we hope to reach the top of the podium in 2017.
