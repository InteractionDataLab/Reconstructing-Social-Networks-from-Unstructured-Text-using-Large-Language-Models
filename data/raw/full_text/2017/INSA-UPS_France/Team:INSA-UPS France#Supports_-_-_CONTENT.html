              With 14,000 alumni, <B>INSA Toulouse</B> is an international, multidisciplinary, state engineering school recognized for the excellence of its five-year curriculum. Created in 1963, it has made a priority out of developing its international dimension as INSA Toulouse has worked to attract many foreign students and developed international programs. Aside from training engineers, its mission includes developing ongoing training, scientific research as well as its valorization, which is why it offers research masters and PhDs.

Created in 1957 by philosopher Gaston Berger and Rector Jean Capelle, <B>INSA Lyon</B> is the oldest and largest of the six schools making up the INSA Group. INSA engineers lead careers built around a logic of high adaptability, a pioneering approach to science and technology, and a strong sense of social responsibility. This hallmark of the INSA Lyon model is a living tribute to its two founders. It is to them that we owe the humanist commitment of the INSA schools, and their openness to different origins, cultures and social backgrounds.
