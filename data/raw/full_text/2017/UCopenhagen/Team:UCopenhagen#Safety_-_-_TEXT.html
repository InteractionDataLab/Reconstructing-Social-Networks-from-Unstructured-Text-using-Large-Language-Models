Introduction
Human, animal and environmental safety considerations are prerequisite to commencing any legitimate science project. Working with genetically modified organisms involves advanced regulation owing to its political potency. The relatively recent emergence of synthetic biology and its revolutionary potential earns even more public scrutiny. Vigilant enforcement of safety best practices is critical to preventing avoidable public misconceptions.
Incell has received extensive safety training from the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. From the very beginning we integrated safety into the concept creation and experimental design. All decisions have been made in accordance with Danish, EU and WHO safety legislation (Retsinformation, 2009).

Laboratory work
All team members have completed laboratory safety training and are acquainted with regulations relevant to our work.
We are confident in our ability to prevent and respond to safety risks and adhere to all hygiene, clothing and behaviour requirements specific to the context of our work.
Waste disposal has been in accordance with all applicable regulation and legislation. Liquid GMO waste is autoclaved prior to disposal and plastic waste placed in appropriate bags labelled ‘Clinical risk waste’ before handling by the university.
Our model organisms and synthetic BioBricks pose zero risk to human health, fall within Risk Group 1 and do not require additional safety measures.
A complete and detailed account of our safety considerations and protocols can be found through the links below:
