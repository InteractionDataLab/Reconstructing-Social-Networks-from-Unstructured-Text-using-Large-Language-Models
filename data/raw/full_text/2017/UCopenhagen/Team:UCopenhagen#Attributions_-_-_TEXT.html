The team worked together to come up with the idea for the project, design and perform the laboratory experiments, write the funding applications, plan and do our human practice activities and code and write the wiki.
But we couldn’t have done it alone. The following lists all the people who has helped us, and how they have supported us.
General support Professor Sotirios Kampranis is our PI and helped us during the vital brainstorming process. He aided throughout the project with his expertise from the UCPH-course “Synthetic Biology”, which he teaches.
PhD Konstantinos Vanvitas was also deeply involved in converting our ideas into a project. Centre coordinator Nanna Heinz and PhD student Cecilie Hansen, who both previously have been involved in iGEM, also advised us throughout the project.
The team members of UCopenhagen team 2016 Cosmocrops advised us on the crucial initial steps of shaping a successful iGEM project.
Fundraising support Centre coordinator Nanna Heinz advised our funding team on how to approach companies professionally both verbally and in writing.
Laboratory support Immensely valuable support was provided by Postdoc Simon Dusséaux and Anastasia Anthanasakoglou who aided in protocol design as well as supervised our laboratory techniques.
Yeast work
Simon provided us a modification (AM94) of the yeast strain S288C.
Cells and vectors
Anastasia and Simon provided us several E.coli strains; mach1 for cloning,  BL21 competent cells for expression and MG1655 for amplification of genes from   gDNA. Anastasia also kindly provided the pRSET vector, the pET102 vector as well  as His antibodies.
Protocol design
Simon, Anastasia and Sotirios aided us thoroughly in protocol design and  experimental procedures.
Laboratory technician Lene Dansten runs the mandatory safety tours of the laboratories and also gives practical support to everyone at PLEN.
Difficult technique support
Associate Professor Henning Jørgensen in the Plant and Soil Science section at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences kindly allowed us access their HPLC-MS facilities.
PhD student Rasmus Dahl-Lassen and laboratory coordinator Anja Hect Ivø assisted in our HPLC-MS experiments and amino acid quantification analysis.
Postdoc Simon Dusséaux aided us in the use of the departments fluorescence microscope.
Wiki support
MSc in biology Oluf Sonne Georg with a talent in drawing and art design made most of our illustrations and all of our animations. He also gave us the tools and building blocks to create our poster.
Presentation coaching support
Annette Bjerre Ryhede from ARTIKULATION provided our presentation team her vital expertise on coaching and the art of presenting in front of a crowd.
Human Practices support
Nanna Heinz helped us gather our thoughts and plans for human practices and outreach.
NiC Journalist Torill Kornfeldt gave a presentation on communicating with media  and how to sell an iGEM project, which proved to be of great value in our  interaction with PharmaDanmark . A former iGEM’er from UCopenhagen, Will Wright, now involved in biotech business development, hosted a workshop on how to pitch business ideas.   Cand.phil Sune Holm gave a presentation on ethics in SynBio and provided important information on how to communicate science to the broad public.   PhD Konstantinos Vanvitas, Assoc. professor Chris Workman, PostDoc  James Behrendorff and Kenneth Jensen of Novozymes gave valuable  feedback to all teams during the judging of NiC.
Vartovs Videnskab The founders of Vartovs Videnskab Jamila Lilja and Anna Øhlenschlæger  kindly helped us establish a venue for our public presentation of our project, synthetic biology and helped us facilitate a public debate on synthetic biology.
As a part of our panel discussion Cand.phil Sune Holm and Postdoc Thomas Laursen participated were featured and they gave invaluable insights into ethical applications and democratic uses of synthetic biology. They also provided an introduction to the field of synthetic biology and its applications to our listeners.
Synapse - Life Science Connect The student driven life sciences organisation Synapse kindly featured us in their event “Synapse Lecture Session: synthetic biology”.
