Collaboration is a powerful driver of progress in science. To stand on the shoulders of giants is increasingly unrealistic in a globalised world where scientists work in ever more specialised areas and without geographic or language barriers.
For science to continue to benefit from globalisation, we must advance the axiom and seek to build a human pyramid from the shoulders before and around us. Collaboration and open source data are at the heart of iGEM and so too the heart of Incell.
Below we describe our most significant collaborations within the iGEM community. The symbiosis we strive for in our project has shone brightly through the partnerships established with teams around the world. Our story — and the stories of our friends — have been mutually shaped by the diversity of our shared experiences, knowledge and perspectives.

DTU Biobuilders’ BioBrick Weekend (February, 2017)
DTU-Denmark (Denmark)
SDU-Denmark (Denmark)
NTNU Trondheim (Norway)
Chalmers-Gothenburg (Sweden)
An inspiring and practical three-day introduction to iGEM hosted by our friends and closest neighbours. Workshops covered the structure of the competition, hands-on laboratory experience in BioBrick assembly and debate of the ethical considerations surrounding synthetic biology.

Nordic iGEM Conference (June, 2017)
DTU-Denmark (Denmark)
SDU-Denmark (Denmark)
Stockholm (Sweden)
Lund (Sweden)
Uppsala University (Sweden)
Chalmers-Gothenburg (Sweden)
Aalto-Helsinki (Finland)
In the tradition of the previous year’s winners hosting the following year’s conference, we had the pleasure to host teams from the Nordic region in Copenhagen. Teams had the opportunity to present their projects and receive questions and feedback from peers and judges. It was beneficial and a huge confidence boost for teams to be able to play with presentation strategy and get a feel for which parts of project stories gained traction and areas in need of development. All in a safe space in front of an audience of equals.

Incell podcast series (August–November, 2017)
Toronto (Canada)
REC-CHENNAI (India)
We have been and continue to be, very motivated in taking Incell beyond the lab. The Incell podcast series has enabled us to draw upon diverse scientific, non-scientific, cultural and environmental perspectives from around the world. Incell is an abstract, foundational science project and we felt it important for development to be in the spirit of the humanity we hope to serve. Collaborating with other teams from Canada and India enhanced our content, multiplied our audience and maximised the public outreach and human value of our work.

SDU Wiki writing workshop (August, 2017)
DTU-Denmark (Denmark)
SDU-Denmark (Denmark)
A brilliant day of workshops offering advice and inspiration for producing an effective and beautiful wiki. SDU are established leaders in producing exceptional iGEM wikis and their counsel proved indispensable when designing and creating our own. We added further value to the event — producing and sharing a video blog of the experience and take home messages with our social media network.
