Introduction
We participated in InterLitab, as we want to be contribute to the scientific progress made through this globe spanning project. In InterLab, 6 test devices are inserted in E.coli D5 α, and the growth and fluorescence is measured.
We used the following plasmids provided by iGEM HQ to transform E.coli:
Positive control
Negative control
Test Device 1: J23101+I13504
Test Device 2: J23106+I13504
Test Device 3: J23117+I13504
Test Device 4: J23101.BCD2.E0040.B0015
Test Device 5: J23106.BCD2.E0040.B0015
Test Device 6: J23117.BCD2.E0040.B0015
Calibrations
Before our measurements began, we performed some calibrations: First an OD600 reference point for our plate reader, performed with LUDOX according to the protocol. Here we found a correction factor which can be used to calculate OD from measured absorbance. Our correction fator is 3.11.
Secondly we made a fluorescence standard curve with a serial dilution of fluorescein (figure 1). We used the lower 5 data points to calculate a mean µM fluorescein pr a.u. We chose to use the lower concentration range due to two factors: 1) Linearity is better for the lower fluorescein concentrations, and 2) our measured data has a maximum fluorescence of 500, which makes it more important to have a good fit in the lower range.

Cell measurements
Two colonies from each transformation were picked, and grown in foil-covered 50 ml falcon tubes over night (18 hours).
Preparation OD was measured, and a dilution was calculated to achieve an OD of 0.02. Dilution calculations can be found in the table next to this. Here we used the calculated correction factor from our initial abs/OD calibration. From the absorption measurements taken at 0 hours, we see indications of pipetting errors, as the OD600 (average) ranges from 0.015 to 0.6 (table 1).

OD600
Cell growth stagnated between 4 and 6 hours. Cells transformed with Test Device 1 and 4 grew slower than the 6 other transformations, and even decreased in OD between 4 and 6 hours.
Figure 2 Fluorescence measurement in high-fluorescing samples (positive control and test devices 1, 2 and 4) over 6 hours.
Figure 3 OD measurements in low-fluorescing samples (negative control and test devides 3, 5 and 6) over 6 hours.
Fluorescence
Some transformed cells continue to increase fluorescence despite a decrease in OD in the same samples. Devices 3 and 6 are very close to the negative control in fluorescence.

Figure 5 Fluorescence measurements in low-fluorescing samples (negative control and test devides 3, 5 and 6) over 6 hours.
Conclusion
Our data indicate which plasmid elements induce the highest production of GFP.  Plasmids containing J23117 (Test devices 3 and 6) does not express fluorescence to a higher degree than the negative control. Plasmids with J23101 (Device 1 and 4) induced the highest fluorescence, and plasmids containing J23106 (Test devices 2 and 5) were somewhere in between. Combining the J23101 or J23106 with I13504 (Test devices 1-3) gave a higher fluorescence than adding BCD2.E0040.B0015 (Test devices 4-6).
These results are not reliable on their own, but will be more robust and reliable when combined with data from the other teams participating in the interlab study.
