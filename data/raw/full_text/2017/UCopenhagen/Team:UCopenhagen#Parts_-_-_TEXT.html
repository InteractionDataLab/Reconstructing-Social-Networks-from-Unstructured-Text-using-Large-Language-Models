Overview of our Biobricks
All our submitted Biobricks are listed on this page. Special attention should be directed to our two favorite parts:
BBa_K2455003 , a Cell-Penetrating USER Cassette, which is completely novel in iGEM. We believe this brick can benefit many iGEM teams in the years to come, as we have made it easy to insert any protein of interest in the USER casette. We have already used it ourselves, to create our second favorite part.
BBa_K2455002 , an improved version of the super yellow fluorescent protein BBa_K864100 that we believe fulfills the gold medal criteria to improve a previous part or project.
