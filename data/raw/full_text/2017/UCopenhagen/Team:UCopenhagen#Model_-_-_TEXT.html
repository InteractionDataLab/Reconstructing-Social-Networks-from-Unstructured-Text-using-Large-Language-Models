Introduction
The modelling part of IGEM Copenhagen 2017 simulates the behavior of the Number Control and Interdependency subprojects of our synthetic endosymbiosis. The modelling parameters are as far as possible based on experimental results and estimates.
The modelling was meant to serve 3 main tasks:
1)As an in silico representation of the combined host-endosymbiont system which we couldn’t physically create in the wet lab given the available amount of time and resources at our disposal.
2)As a way to predict parameter dependencies and feasibility of the real system and thus give inspiration to the design of wet lab experiments and future usages.
3)As a very simple software toolbox to be used in practical implementations of future synthetic endosymbiosis setups.
A total of 4 different models have been made and are described separately below. All parameters and sources can be found in Table 1.
Model 1
Model 2
Figure 3 : Interdependency host consumption versus symbiont production of tryptophan. The plots show the average number of endosymbionts needed pr host at different values of the two parameters. Left plot has a larger range of values than the right plot.
