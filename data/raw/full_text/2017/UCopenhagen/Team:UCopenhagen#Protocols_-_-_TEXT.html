To make sure we perform our experiments consistently, and that they can be reproduced by other scientists, we have written protocols for the experiments we have performed across the three subprojects. We have collected them all together below:
General (Used across subprojects)
Protocol for PCR
Protocol for gel electrophoresis
Protocol for plasmid purification
Protocol for DNA purification by gel extraction
Protocol for Mix&Go Transformation
Protocol for LB media
Protocol for Colony PCR
Protocol for DNA sequencing
Protocol for growth curves and OD600 measurements
Protocol for USER ligation
Protocol for USER linearization
Protocol for blunt ligation
Protocol for Restriction digestion
Protocol for transformation into BL21
Interdependency
Protocol for YNB media
Protocol for serial growth experiments
Protocol for HPLC-MS quantification of tryptophan
Number control
Protocol for gRNA seed sequence insertion
Protocol for Heat-shock transformation
Protocol for refined growth curve
Protein Import
Protocol for protein extraction and purification
Protocol for Western Blotting
Protocol for SDS page
