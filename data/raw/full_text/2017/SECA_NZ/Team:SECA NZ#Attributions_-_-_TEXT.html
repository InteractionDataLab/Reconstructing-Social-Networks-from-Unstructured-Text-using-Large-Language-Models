We would like to thank all of these people and organisations for their support
People
Professor Jo Putterill
Without Jo’s scientific guidance and lab space this project would have never occurred. Her vast knowledge of plant biology were vital to the lab team’s success.
Associate Professor Shaun Lott
Shaun has been involved with the team for the last two years. Without his administrative and laboratory support, this project would have never gotten off the ground.
Other Academics
We have recieved a tremendous amount of support from other academics around SBS and the Faculty of Science. We’d like to acknowledge Dr. Davide, Prof. Allan, Dr. Rattenbury, Dr. Lear, Dr. Domigan, Prof. Gerrard and all the other academics who have influenced our project in a positive way.
2016 UoA iGEM Students
Last year’s iGEM undergrad (now postgrad) and PhD students like Kyle, Frankie, Jess, and David, among many others, have given an enormous amount to the team in administrative, moral, and technical support.
Members of  Jo’s and Shaun’s Labs
Jason, Lulu, Mau, Geoffrey, Davide, Andrew, and Wendy, have been invaluable to our lab team sparing their time and experience to guide us through the research process. A special thanks must be extended to them.
Everyone Else
Over this year there have been far too many people to thank. To those who helped us in major ways and those who have helped in ways more subtle. You know who you are. Thank you.
