Frost resistant technology within frost intolerant crops
Every year, millions of dollars worth of produce is damaged or destroyed due to frost. Despite this, growers are left with costly, and often ineffective, methods to combat it.
We wanted to give plants the power to intrinsically stave off the cold. We hope, that as the world's population grows, our project becomes a part of using transgenic crops in sustainable, reliable food production.
This is the SECA NZ iGEM project for 2017.
