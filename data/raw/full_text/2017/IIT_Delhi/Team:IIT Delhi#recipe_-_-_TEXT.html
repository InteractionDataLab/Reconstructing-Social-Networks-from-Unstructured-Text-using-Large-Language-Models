A pinch of salt makes all the difference !!
Preparation of TAE buffer
     20x TAE buffer
80mL of 1M Tris solution
0.7264g of EDTANa2+ salt
2.284 mL glacial acetic acid
distilled H2O 100mL
Preparation of Ethidium Bromide(EtBr)
For the preparation of ethidium bromide adds 1 g of ethidium bromide to 100 ml of H2O.
Stir on a magnetic stirrer for several hours to ensure that the dye has dissolved.
Wrap the container in aluminum foil or transfer the 10 mg/ml solution to a dark bottle and store at room temperature.
Preparation of alkaline lysis solution I
50 mM glucose.
25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0).
10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0).
Prepare Solution I from standard stocks in batches of approx. 100 ml, sterilize by autoclaving and store at 4°C.
Preparation of alkaline lysis solution II (freshly prepared at room temperature)
0.2 N NaOH (freshly diluted from a 10 N stock).
(100ul SDS + 700ul mq + 200ul NaOH) 1% (w/v) SDS.
Preparation of alkaline lysis solution III
5 M potassium acetate, 60.0 ml
Glacial acetic acid, 11.5 ml
H2O, 28.5 ml
The resulting solution is 3 M with respect to potassium and 5 M with respect to acetate. Store the solution at 4°C and transfer it to an ice bucket just before use.
