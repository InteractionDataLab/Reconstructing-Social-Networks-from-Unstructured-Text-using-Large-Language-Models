The transcription and translation mechanism although theoretically processes, in practice it may not be as predicted. The model considered above (or in general  practice) considers abundance of cellular resources such as ribosomes, or amino acids to  carry out the function . In reality, the present quantity may not be sufficient to the facilitate smooth function of each individual biological processes. When we insert a synthetic  plasmid inside a cell, the host has to share the resources it suppose to use for cell growth  and other activities. One can model the competition of cellular processes as virtual induced negative feedback. Suppose, A and B are two mRNA require the ribosome and the  only available ribosome binds with A due to strong RBS in the sequence, then B wont be  translated to the protein form soon. These kind of behavior is known as post transcriptional control. There could be any possible combination of such competition behavior, as  a case study we are considering a competing between p1 and p4. Such competition introduced two implicit feedback to each other in the oscillator. The model of such dynamics  can be written as,
where the parameters are same as earlier. The model is simulated and response is as shown in figure below. Here, we observe an increase in period as expected. This is due to an additional delay involved for ribosome (or any other resource queuing). The competition of resource sharing may quench the oscillation if the delay is more than required. This is a preliminary step to understand how the resource may effect the ideal biomolecular system performance.
