Lack of digital responses in Synthetic Biology have inhibited the diverse potential that accompanies the digitization of biological circuits. This year we developed synthetic modules for signal processing in biological systems, in the form of elements of specialized logic gates based on transcriptional regulation. We moved from computationally demonstrating near digital logic gates with sharp responses, to more specialized collapsible and reconfigurable circuits which can perform various operations like developing square pulses. Further, to realize the aim of making a square wave generator, we engineered a five node repression based ring network to give digital oscillations. Quantitative computational modelling was used to tailor the cellular environment and observe period, steepness, noise and amplitude variations. Our project poses to be an integral element in genetic networks intended to solve scientific challenges for years to come, ranging from making light sensitive frequency modulators and bacterial memory storage systems.
