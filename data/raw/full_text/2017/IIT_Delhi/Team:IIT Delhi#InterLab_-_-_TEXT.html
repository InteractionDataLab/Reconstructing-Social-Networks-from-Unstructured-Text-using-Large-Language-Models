In order to obtain accurate measurements one has to calibrate relative measurements via an absolute standard set of measurements and the lack of such an absolute standard for most of the commonly used reporters in synthetic biology causes variations in the evaluation of the product. To cater to the need to find a standard set of measurement for GFP we participated in the InterLab Measurement Study and shared our results with iGEM along with hundreds of other teams across the globe.
We used black 96 well plate and Synergy H1 microplate reader for our measurements and followed all the protocols provided by iGEM as precisely as possible; the results of which are given below,
