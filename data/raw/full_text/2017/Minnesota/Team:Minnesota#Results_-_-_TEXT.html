We were able to successfully create the PurA part, BBa_K2375000. Additionally, we were able to codon optimize mCherry BBa_J06504 by removing the internal Ribosomal Binding Site. This part was called BBa_K2375001.
We spent a large majority of our time trying to optimize and create the FitD plasmid system. The Gibsonâ€™s Assembly failed multiple times due to nuclease contamination and simply the size of the gene that we were trying to create.
Additionally, we participated in the Interlab study, but we were unable to successfully transform the plasmids because we were given a chloramphenicol resistant E. coli strain.
However, upon beginning to work on our control systems, we had promising results, and we were able to create the PurA gene for use in our control systems.
Further work on this subject could be to continue creating the Purine Auxotropy system as well as experimenting with other auxotrophy and biocontrol systems.
