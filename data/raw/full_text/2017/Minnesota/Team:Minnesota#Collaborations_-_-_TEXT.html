The Minnesota iGEM team created a pamphlet that will contain a variety of safety systems for biocontainment that iGEM teams have made. Examples of safety systems include, but is not limited to, antibiotic resistance plasmids, auxotrophy systems, and kill switches. This is intended to be resource for the future if teams are or will be considering a hypothetical release of their project into the environment and want to study how the system will behave in an ecosystem. It is of the utmost importance to consider safety precautions and implement them into the project beforehand. A google submission form was added to the iGEM news board so that teams across the world could input how they plan on retaining the safety of their project.
We received feedback from three different iGEM teams; iGEM Linkoping Sweden, iGEM Bulgaria, and iGEM Groningen.
We thank all the teams that made this collaboration possible.
