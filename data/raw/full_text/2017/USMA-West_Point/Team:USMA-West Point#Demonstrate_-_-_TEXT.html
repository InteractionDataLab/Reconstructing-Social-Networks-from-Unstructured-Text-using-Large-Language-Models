Here dissected chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) were nucleofected with plasmid OR2W1. The neurons were infiltrated with which in the presence of calcium fluoresces. During an action potential, calcium enters the cell during depolarization which occurs when the ligand binds to the OR2W1 receptors. The change in fluorescence demonstrates the function of this device.
