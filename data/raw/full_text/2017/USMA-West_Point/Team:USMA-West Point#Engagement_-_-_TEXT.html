Public engagement
Public service comes in many forms at the US Military Academy, and presenting scientific work at conferences or to the public to educate, train, and inspire individuals is a core mission for the Cadets and Faculty.
Last year, the team presented work to a panel of military leaders at USMA for two preliminary events to attend an educational conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology known as the Solider Design Competition. One of the competitions was held on Facebook Live which was viewed by 26,000 people, and the cadets were asked live questions by viewers in the comments section.
Additionally, this team is composed primarily of Cadets from the United States Military Academy who are actively serving their country to be future Army leaders. The team has partnered with the Naval Research Laboratories to work with students from other universities who have assisted with this project. The Cadets are actively engaged in public awareness from the training and education they learn at the academy, and their nature besides research and education is to promote honorable living, character, and competence in the public domain.
