OR2W1 in pSB1C3
Part:BBa_K2222001
For the OR2W1 in pSB1C3 plasmid, one reaction used the BglII and PstI enzymes. The expected products for this reaction were two bands at 2.3kb and 0.8kb. Because the BglII site is unique to OR2W1 coding sequence, then only a single band at 2.2kb would be expected if the colony contained only the empty pSB1C3 plasmid. The second reaction used the MscI enzyme. The expected products for this reaction were also two bands at 1.9kb and 1.2kb. Because both the pSB1C3 plasmid and OR10G4 coding sequence each contain a single MscI site, then only a single band at 2.2kb would be expected if the colony contained only the empty pSB1C3 plasmid. As shown by the image of the gel with the restriction endonuclease reaction products, the band patterns reveal a colony containing the pSB1C3 plasmid with the OR2W1 coding sequence.
OR10G4 in pSB1C3
Part:BBa_K2222000
For the OR10G4 in pSB1C3 plasmid, one reaction used the EcoRI and BamHI enzymes. The expected products for this reaction were two bands at 2.3kb and 0.7kb. Because the BamHI site is unique to OR10G4 coding sequence, then only a single band at 2.2kb would be expected if the colony contained only the empty pSB1C3 plasmid. The second reaction used the BlpI and PstI enzymes. The expected products for this reaction were also two bands at 2.3kb and 0.7kb. Because the BlpI site is unique to OR10G4 coding sequence, then only a single band at 2.2kb would be expected if the colony contained only the empty pSB1C3 plasmid. As shown by the image of the gel with the restriction endonuclease reaction products, the band patterns reveal a colony contains the pSB1C3 plasmid with the OR10G4 coding sequence.
