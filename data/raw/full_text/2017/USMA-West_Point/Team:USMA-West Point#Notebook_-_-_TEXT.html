NOTEBOOK
Day to Day activity inside the lab
January 2017
Transformation of Bacteria Cells
OR vectors were purchased from OriGene and transfected into XL-10 Gold Ultracompetent cells by heat shocking at 42 degrees Celsius
Cells were cultured in LB broth to amplify vectors
DNA gels were run with specific restriction enzymes to determine multiple cloning sites
Participants
Dr. Alexander Mitropoulos, Dr. Ken Wickiser, Dr. Kamil Woronowicz, 2LT Dillon Macky, 2LT Ishmael Raheem, CDT Jason Hug, CDT Elizabeth Huuki, CDT Channah Mills, CDT Matthew McDonough, Isaac Dabkowski
February 2017
Western Blotting
HT-22 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with phosphate and protease inhibitors
Protein concentration was measured for each OR
Proteins were prepared with Laemmle sample buffer before loading into 4% Bis-Tris gels to measure protein purity and size
Participants
Dr. Alexander Mitropoulos, Dr. Ken Wickiser, Dr. Kamil Woronowicz, 2LT Dillon Macky, 2LT Ishmael Raheem, CDT Jason Hug, CDT Elizabeth Huuki, CDT Channah Mills, CDT Matthew McDonough, Isaac Dabkowski​
March 2017
Confocal Microscopy
HT-22 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunohistochemistry with antibodies responsible for individual OR binding followed by secondary antibodies for visualization
Participants
Dr. Alexander Mitropoulos, Dr. Ken Wickiser, Dr. Kamil Woronowicz, 2LT Dillon Macky, 2LT Ishmael Raheem, CDT Jason Hug, CDT Elizabeth Huuki, CDT Channah Mills, CDT Matthew McDonough, Isaac Dabkowski
April 2017
Action Potential Measurements
Nucleofected HT-22 cells were stimulated with individual odorants
The neurons generated action potentials that were measured via a microelectrode array
Participants
Dr. Alexander Mitropoulos, Dr. Ken Wickiser, Dr. Kamil Woronowicz, 2LT Dillon Macky, 2LT Ishmael Raheem, CDT Jason Hug, CDT Elizabeth Huuki, CDT Channah Mills, CDT Matthew McDonough, Isaac Dabkowski
May 2017
USMA Projects Day
Presented research at United States Military Academy Projects Day, a day where students present projects concerning research in various fields
Reports put together for eNOSE
Participants
Dr. Alexander Mitropoulos, Dr. Ken Wickiser, Dr. Kamil Woronowicz, 2LT Dillon Macky, 2LT Ishmael Raheem, CDT Jason Hug, CDT Elizabeth Huuki, CDT Channah Mills, CDT Matthew McDonough, Isaac Dabkowski
June 2017

September 2017
Interlab Protocol and iGEM Plasmid
Completed Interlab protocol and collected data
Developed iGEM plasmid by transfection and amplification
Ran gel of plasmids to evaluate
Participants
