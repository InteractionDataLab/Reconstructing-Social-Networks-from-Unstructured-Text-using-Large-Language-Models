Project
Current state-of-the-art inorganic hardware sensors for biological and chemical agent detection are highly tailored for specific chemicals and cannot be used to detect compounds outside of a highly defined analyte set. With the growing threat of chemical and biological warfare, new diseases, and food borne pathogens, there is an increased need for rapid and sensitive recognition to identify such agents. Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is a detailed and nuanced selection process that organisms employ to detect and discriminate thousands of possible odorants.
TEAM
Our team is a highly trained collection of Life Science Cadets from the United States Military Academy. We are leaders at West Point, and we plan to be leaders of science in synthetic biology.
PROJECT
Our project utilizes the natural genetic sequence of human olfactory receptors. These plasmid sequences are inserted into animal neurons and a measured action potential can be used to detect odorants for homeland security, medical, and other necessary applications.
DELIVERABLES
We accomplished the necessary requirements for the bronze and silver iGEM medals. Judge us for Gold. Click here to learn more.
