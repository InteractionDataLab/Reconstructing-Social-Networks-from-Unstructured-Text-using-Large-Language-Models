Experiments
PRotocols used for each step of the process
Methods
Transformation of bacterial cells
OR vectors were purchased from OriGene and used to transform XL-10 Gold Ultracompetent cells by heat shocking at 42 Â°C
Cells were cultured in LB broth to amplify vectors
DNA gels were run with specific restrion enzymes to determine multiple cloaning sites

Western Blotting
HT-22 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with phosphate and protease inhibitors
Protein concentration was measured for each OR
Proteins were prepared with Laemmli sample buffer before loading into 4% Bis-Tris gels to measure protein purity and size
Relevant documents
Western Blotting Protocol
Confocal Microscopy
HT-22 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunohistochemistry with antibodies responsible for individual OR binding  followed by secondary antibodies for visualization
Action Potential Measurements
Nucleofected HT-22 cells were stimulated with individual odorants
The neurons generated action potentials that were measured via a microelectrode array
