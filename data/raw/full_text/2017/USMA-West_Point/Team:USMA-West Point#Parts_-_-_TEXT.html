OR2W1 in pSB1C3
Part:BBa_K2222001
Human olfactory receptor, family 2, subfamily W, member 1 (OR2W1). Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome.
This is an OR sequence that responds to hexanol.
OR10G4 in pSB1C3
Part:BBa_K2222000
Human olfactory receptor, family 10, subfamily G, member 4 (OR10G4). Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome.
This is an OR sequence that responds to vanillin.
