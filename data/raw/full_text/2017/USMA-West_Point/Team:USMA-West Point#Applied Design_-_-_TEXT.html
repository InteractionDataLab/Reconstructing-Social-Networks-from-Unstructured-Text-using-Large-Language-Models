The team believes they have found a sustainable, sensitive method to detect a mixture of odorants from a small sample volume. The team has provided two sequences to produce odorant receptors in animal neurons that have been read on two different devices using fluorescence or field potential measurements and can be utilized with static or dynamic devices. This vision allows us to not only use receptors from the human genome but use receptors across the complete animal kingdom producing a device that expands upon any species’ current method of odorant detection. This vision allows us to identify all smells that have been selected throughout the entire animal kingdom and does not confusion perception with sensation. Better understanding this technology will allow the team to model specific odorant receptors that are presently unknown to detect odorants that currently do not have odorant receptors and are therefore “undetectable”.
