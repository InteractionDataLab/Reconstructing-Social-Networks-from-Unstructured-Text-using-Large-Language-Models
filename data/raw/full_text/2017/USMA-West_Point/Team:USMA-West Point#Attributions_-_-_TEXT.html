ATTRIBUTION
The eNOSE project has been in motion for several months now, and would not have gained as much momentum as it has without the generous help and mentoring from several individuals. In particular, the USMA-West Point team would like to formally thank:
DR. ALEX MITROPOULOS
PRIMARY PI
Dr. Mitropoulos has served as a crucial mentor to the team throughout the research process. He is truly the backbone of our group, and helps us balance time in the lab with our other Cadet activities. He continually goes above and beyond to explain to us the second and third order effects of our research. Without him, we could not be successful as a team.
DR. J.KEN WICKISER
PRIMARY PI
Dr. Wickiser was essential in getting USMA-West Point involved in the iGEM competition. Because of him, we are able to communicate the importance of our project on an international scale.
DR. RUSSEL K. PIRLO
sECONDARY PI
Dr. Pirlo was essential in designing one of the devices for the USMA-West Point iGEM team. He took on 4 Cadets who learned about interdisciplinary research at NRL for 3 weeks over the summer. He helped solidify parts of the project to enhance the device phase for this team.
DR. KAMIL WORONOWICZ
sECONDARY pi
Dr. Woronowicz was essential for the transformation of the first plasmid. He established the protocols for transfection and amplification of the plasmids.
DR. JOHN CAVE
instructor
Since being here, Dr. Cave has not only developed the team's ability to understand the theory behind eNOSE and the bioengineering associated with it, but also has taught us to predict results and question everything.
DR. JOEL GASTON
instructor
Dr. Gaston was a mentor and leader for the team of students and cadets at NRL to design the 3D printed parts for the field potential device.
The team would also like to thank the United States Military Academy Department of Chemistry and Life Science and the Naval Research Laboratory for using space in their labs
