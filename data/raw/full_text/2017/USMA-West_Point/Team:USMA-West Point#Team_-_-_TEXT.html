TEAM
Welcome to the United States Military Academy (USMA)- West Point iGEM Team. Our team is composed primarily of USMA Cadets and Professors with the assistance from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Our team is interdisciplinary and collaborative to successful produce our final product, an Electronic Nose.
CDT ZACH ANDERSEN
STUDENT LEADER
Zach is a 1st Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department with a focus in Life Science. While this is his first year on a research team, he hopes that his lab experience will be enhanced through classes at the Academy to provide benefit to the team.
CDT JASON HUG
STUDENT LEADER
Jason is a 1st Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department with a focus in Life Science. Jason has been a member of this research team for a full year and looks forward to using his knowledge and experience on the project to build and lead the "e-Nose" team of well-rounded individuals.
CDT ALANNA APPEL
STUDENT
Alanna is a 3rd Class Cadet at USMA in the Behavior and Life Science Department with a pre-Medicine track. She is new to research but looking forward to working on the project and gaining laboratory experience outside of class.
CDT PAYTON BOYLSON
STUDENT
Payton is a 3rd Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department. She spent 4 weeks as a USMA Liaison at NRL developing a new sensing system for the eNose Project. For this project she was amazed by the amount of engineering that was required in order to prepare experiments.
RAYONNA GORDON
STUDENT
Rayonna is a senior Biomedical Engineering major at North Carolina A&T State University who worked at the Naval Research Laboratory with several Cadets. Incorporating biology with engineering is what she aims to do as a career. This project has given her insight and helped develop her skills in combining biology with several different engineering disciplines.
CDT LIZ HUUKI
STUDENT
Liz is a 3rd Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department. For this project she has been working mainly with the individual plasmids, an aspect which really interests her and has helped her develop technical skills. She is very excited to be able to combine what she is learning in class with actual lab experience.
CDT KYLOR KIESEWETTER
STUDENT
Kylor is a 1st Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department with a focus in Life Science. Kylor has significant research experience on biomaterials. He hopes to add a unique perspective while providing his leadership capabilities.
CDT CHANNAH MILLS
STUDENT
Channah is a 3rd Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department with a focus in Chemical Engineering. For this project she has been working with the individual plasmids, an aspect which has helped her develop technical and laboratory skills by combining what she is learning in class with laboratory experience.
CDT MATT McDONOUGH
studenT
Matt is a 3rd Class Cadet at USMA in the Chemistry and Life Science Department with a focus in Life Science. He spent 4 weeks as a USMA Liaison at NRL developing a new sensing system for the eNose Project. He has worked mainly with the computer-aided design aspect of this project, but is looking forward to working on the bioengineering side of it.
WINSTON OU
studen
Winston is a Junior at the University of California, Berkeley studying Chemical Engineering. He worked at the Naval Research Laboratory with several cadets where he shared his experience with the team. He enjoys the engineering aspect of the project, particularly designing everything and seeing it come to fruition.
CDT JAMES PRUNESKI
student
James is a 2nd Class Cadet at USMA in the Mathematical Sciences Department with a focus in Life Science. He spent time last year observing this project, but is looking forward to helping out with it this year.
