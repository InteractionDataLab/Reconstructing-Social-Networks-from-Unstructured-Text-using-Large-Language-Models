eLECTRONIC NOSE
DETECTION THROUGH OLFACTION
ABOUT US
The Electronic Nose (eNose) is composed of 1st Class Cadets, 2nd Class Cadets, and 3rd Class Cadets in the Departments of Chemistry and Life Science and Department of Mathematical Sciences. We've partnered with scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) to develop a synthetic biology project to assist with the detection of aerosols and gases using a cell-based sensor.
Located in the scenic Hudson River Valley, only 50 miles north of New York City, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point is a four-year academic institution, a nationally-renowned historic site, and the oldest continuously occupied military post in America.
TEAM
Our team is a highly trained collection of Life Science Cadets from the United States Military Academy. We are leaders at West Point, and we plan to be leaders of science in synthetic biology.
PROJECT
Our project utilizes the natural genetic sequence of human olfactory receptors. These plasmid sequences are inserted into animal neurons and a measured action potential can be used to detect odorants for homeland security, medical, and other necessary applications.
DELIVERABLES
We accomplished the necessary requirements for the bronze and silver iGEM medals. Judge us for Gold. Click here to learn more.
