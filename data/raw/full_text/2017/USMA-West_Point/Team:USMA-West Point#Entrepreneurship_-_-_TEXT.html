"Taking an idea and bringing it to reality is challenging on a cadet schedule."
- USMA West Point iGEM Team
The team established a sub group of three Cadets who established a team to develop a business plan based on the current research. One of the Cadets took an Entrepreneurial Management course where he wrote an executive summary, a business model, and marketing strategy to design a competitive advantage given analyzed financial factors. To assist with the development of their plan, the team met and presented their idea to a panel of consultants from Bain and Company in New York City, NY where they were critiqued on their style and knowledge. After working with the consultants to improve their business model, the team presented at the 2017 Mid-Hudson Regional Business Plan Competition where they took First place in the Advanced Technology section. They proceeded to the New York State Business Plan Competition where they did not place.
