Collection of Parts
Here you can find our best collection of parts. We took five different fluorescent proteins (mVenus, sfGFP, mCerulean, mRFP and eYFP) and we split them to be used in Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) analysis. All these parts have been characterized and our Best Part is a practical application of split proteins, used in the visualization system of Mantis.
