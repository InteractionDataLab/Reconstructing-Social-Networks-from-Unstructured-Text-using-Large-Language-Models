This year's Wageningen iGEM team has been working hard and while doing so has kept the medal requirements in mind. Below each medal, a list can be found which completes the criteria that have to be met to earn the medals.
Advanced models were created and used to get insight into the quorum sensing and reporter system parts of our project.
Integrated Human Practices:
We consulted with experts from the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), the corporate Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics in Belgium, workers of the Médecines sans Frontières (MSF/Doctors without Borders) organization, a philosophy professor and many more. With the insights gained from experts in the field of diagnostics and people from MSF in Africa and Brazil we were able to improve the diagnostic device to suit the requirements of such a device. We were also able to take the biosafety aspect of our project into account and even consider the ethical dillemma's that arise when implementing a new diagnostic device.
We improved BioBricks BBa_I715022 & BBa_I715023 by changing the incorrect split site AA155 to the correct split site AA168 BBa_K2387055 .
During our project we demonstrated that Mantis is viable in blood serum dilutions, and that fluorescence can indeed be measured in blood serum.        Furthermore, we performed experiments to consistently air-dry our cells, and we combined several wet-lab project to perfect the functionality of Mantis.
Validated the functionality of the following submitted BioBricks:

We collaborated with the Utrecht and TU Delft iGEM teams to verify parts of our systems.
Organized and hosted the BeNeLux iGEM meet-up .
Participated and completed a RIVM project on biosafety , which was rewarded with a grant.
We thoroughly looked into the ethical aspects of implementing a new diagnostic.
Since biosafety is a concern when working with GMO's we looked into options of biocontainment and did a literature research on risk and safety assessment.
Registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and will attend the Giant Jamboree.
We met all deliverables requirements and submitted 36 new BioBricks .
Created an Attributions page with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.
We participated in the InterLab Measurement Study .
