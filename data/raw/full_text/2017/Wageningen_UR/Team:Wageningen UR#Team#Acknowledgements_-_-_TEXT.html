Laboratories of Microbiology (MIB) & Systems and Synthetic Biology (SSB)
The Mantis team would like to thank the MIB and SSB chair groups for their various contributions the past year: amongst them are making several work spaces available, allowing us to use their facilities and equipment and giving useful feedback during the Go/No-go presentations.
People that we would like to thank individually are prof. John van der Oost for giving us advice on the feasibility and design of our bacteria, Philippe Guilla Puylaert for introducing us to the building and giving the safety tour for our team members and Sjon Hendriks for installing our computers and solving the problems when something went awry. Furthermore, we want to give a huge shoutout to our technicians Tom Schonewille, Tom van de Weijer and Ton van Gelder, for ordering all our primers, chemicals and much more, in addition to giving us access to the -80 degrees repositories of both departments.
From the Department of Virology we would like to thank Corinne Geertsema for her work as technician during the time members were working at Virology and Tessy Hick, who generated Chikungunya spike proteins which were used in our project. Finally, dr. prof. Jan van Lent deserves our gratitude for his help with setting up the electron microscope.
We would also like to acknowledge the WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training on Human African Trypanosomiasis Diagnostics, in addition to the OIE Reference Laboratory for Surra. These institutions provided us the genomic DNA for the Trypanosoma brucei species, which was vital for our project.
