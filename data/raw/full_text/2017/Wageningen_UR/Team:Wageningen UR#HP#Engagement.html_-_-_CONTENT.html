                                Within iGEM Wageningen, we attach great value to involving the public in our project. This is why we involved in several educational projects, and presented our project at several conferences, meetings, and in multiple websites and magazines. In this way, we informed all the different target audiences, from children and citizins to students and scientists, about our project and synthetic biology in general. Moreover, we organised a Benelux iGEM meetup to connect all iGEM teams in the Netherlands and Belgium in a meaningful way. Information about this meetup can be found

                                We attach a great value to educating the public about genetic modification, in particular synthetic biology. This relatively new field in science raises many concerns when people are, for example, not educated properly about the opportunities, but also the risks, it raises.</P><P>During our other public engagement projects (see below) we engaged with the general public, informing them about our project and synthetic biology in general. However, in the activities listed below, we took it a step further, from informing to education and real personal engagement.

This is a biology competition for clever and talented secondary school students. In the international finals, this year in the United Kingdom, 4 students per country compete in this science olympiad. They are tested on their abilities to tackle biological problems and doing biological experiments. The aim is to promote science to talented young students and to stress the importance of biology in society. In the national finals at the 9th of June in Wageningen, twenty top-students of the Netherlands gathered for a week of science. We contributed to the NBO by educating the students in the field of DNA techniques and synthetic biology. A summary video of the whole NBO can be found <A href="https://www.biologieolympiade.nl/2017/terugblikfilm-eindronde-nbo-2017/" target="_blank">here</A>.</P><P>Before the lecture, they knew about Golden Rice and insulin production by microorganisms as the only examples in biotechnology. During the practicals on plant genetics, we gave a one-and-half hour lecture about current DNA techiniques and synthetic biology, followed by an exam of 10 closed and 2 open questions. This covered the basics of gene expression and plasmid assembly, as well as more complicated assembly methods and modification techniques. We introduced them into the field of synthetic biology, a subject that was new for most students. They learned about it, and had the opportunity to think about the rational and ethical issues. In this way, we involved these students into synthetic biology and our iGEM project, and we got input from the students into these fields.</P><P>The main findings can be found below. To summarize: after the lecture, the students saw the potential in synthetic biology to combat infectious diseases. However, it also raises some safety, ethical and biocontainment-related concerns. Following these findings, we worked on these issues. The outcome of this can be read on the
                                <MARK>Biosafety</MARK> page.

Here, we Snapchatted throughout our day. We showed the target audience, mostly secondary school students who are interested in the Wageningen University, what we do throughout the day, and that science is really versatile and interesting! In this way we not only promoted the Wageningen University, but also brought the iGEM competition under attention by these future scientists.</P></DIV><DIV class="Title"><H3>NEMO Kennislink</H3></DIV><DIV class="Textbox Title"><P><A href="https://www.nemokennislink.nl/" target="_blank">NEMO Kennislink</A>, an online magazine that focuses on making scientific news reachable to the general public, posted an article on iGEM and our project.

A Global One Health is a theme that reflects the interconnectedness and global nature of health care. More specifically, it focusses on interdisciplinary ways for controlling the risk of disease outbreaks and reduction of endemic infectious diseases. Not only for human healthcare, but also for food supply, hygiene, medicins, vaccins, vector control and crop protection. More about this initiative can be found <A href="http://www.wur.nl/en/About-Wageningen/Strategic-Plan/Global-One-Health.htm" target="_blank">here</A>.</P><P>For this initiative, we wrote a blog about the rise of infectious diseases, taking African Sleeping Sickness as an example for the problematic situations in tropical regions with regards to infectious diseases, and how there is a need for a new diagnostic device. Moreover, an infographic was made to visualise our device.</P><P>
