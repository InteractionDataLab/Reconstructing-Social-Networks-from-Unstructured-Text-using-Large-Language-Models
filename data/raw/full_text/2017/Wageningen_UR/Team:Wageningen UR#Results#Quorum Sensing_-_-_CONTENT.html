In a final state, all the cells in the medium will lysed allowing component A to B to interact and generate a fluorescent signal.</P><DIV class="Title"><H2>Introduction</H2></DIV><P>Mantis is a modular bacterial diagnostic device that will generate a visible fluorescent signal upon detection of viral antigens in blood samples from viral-infected patients. When quantifying fluorescence, a low signal-to-noise ratio hinders a proper understanding of the fluorescence detector. Therefore, it is necessary to both increase the sensitivity of the detection and decrease the background signal to allow for a higher accuracy and precision of the quantitative fluorescence measurements [1].
                        </P><P>While the fast Mantis reporter module (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Results/Cpx">Signal Transduction</A> and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Results/SpecificVisualization">Specific Visualization</A>) focuses on generating a signal in the shortest possible time, this project will focus on getting the most robust detection system. Due to the modular nature of Mantis, it is easy to swap out one system for the other, based on the requirements of the antigen we want to detect. For example, when highly contagious diseases are to be detected, a fast signal would be preferred. However, when the aim is to detect diseases that are not very contagious, but pose a large health risk if untreated, the least amount of false negatives is desired. 

                        </P><P>The robust Mantis reporter module is based on a spatially separated two-component system. For that, two bacterial cell populations (BCP) will be used, each expressing only one of the two components needed to generate the output signal. Both components will be isolated inside their own BCP so the fluorescent signal is not generated. The two components will only be able to interact with each other after both BCPs lyse, which will be biologically induced after sensing the antigen (Figure 1).

                            Together with a reduction of the background signal, a higher sensitivity of the system is desired. For that, a quorum sensing mechanism will be implemented in both BCPs so the signal output produced after the detection of the antigen is propagated to all the bacteria present, no matter if they are directly detecting the antigen or not (Figure 2).

                            </DIV></DIV><P>In conclusion, when the antigen is detected, a lytic mechanism triggers the lysis of both BCPs. This will allow the interaction of both interdependent components leading to the generation of a fluorescent signal. Provided that both components are separated by both bacterial cell membranes, the background signal is hypothesized to be reduced as the random interaction of those two components is expected to be lower than when present within the same BCP. Therefore, by reducing the background signal which could be generated by the random interaction of both components, the signal-to-noise ratio will be increased (Figure 3).

                                Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication system based on chemical molecules which allow bacteria to detect the presence of other bacteria. This mechanism allows bacteria to control gene expression in response to changes in bacteria concentration in the medium [1,4]. In many Gram-negative bacteria QS is mainly controlled by production and diffusion of Acylated Homoserine Lactone (AHL). AHL is able to freely diffuse from cell-to-cell. Once AHL is detected, it is able to trigger other bacteria to generate more AHL molecules, creating a positive feedback loop. Our quorum sensing mechanism (originating from <I>Vibrio fischeri</I>) is controlled by two proteins: LuxI (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0061">BBa_C0061</A>) and LuxR (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0062">BBa_C0062</A>). LuxR is a transcription factor that becomes active when complexed with AHL, leading to the transcription of genes placed under the pLux promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0062">BBa_R0062</A>) (Figure 4) [2].

                                In nature, the LuxR-AHL complex controls transcription of LuxI via a positive feedback loop which increases the AHL production. When the AHL concentration is high in the cell, dimerization with LuxR protein takes place in higher amounts [3]. Both LuxI and LuxR are expressed under the pLux promoter. However, LuxI is controlled by the Lux PR promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0062">BBa_R0062</A>) whose expression is upregulated by the LuxR complex and the LuxR gene is controlled by the reverse Lux PL promoter (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0063">BBa_R0063</A>) whose expression is downregulated by LuxR complex [4]. Both promoters are the same sequence but inverted, with one of them being upregulated by the LuxR complex while the other one is downregulated.

                                QS takes place in nature under high bacterial concentrations. However, in our case, the QS mechanism is desired to only become active after the detection of the antigen. For that, the quorum sensing system needs to be repressed in order to prevent it from auto-activating.

Therefore, in our system, when both AHL and LuxR are present in the cell, the dimer is formed and GFP is expressed as a reporter. Two negative controls were constructed to perform this experiment. Negative control 1 encodes only GFP under the pLux promoter and no LuxR nor LuxI (Figure A). Provided that no AHL nor LuxR will be generated, the formation of the [AHL-LuxR] dimer will not take place and no fluorescence will be generated. Negative control 2 encodes for GFP and LuxR under the pLux promoter but no LuxI (Figure A). In this case, as no AHL can be formed, the dimer wont be formed and therefore GFP can’t be generated.

LuxR encodes for a protein which dimerizes with AHL. Once the dimer is formed, the genes under the pLux promoter will be expressed, hence fluorescence is generated (Figure 5). It can be seen in the graph that negative control 1 is slightly more active, while the LuxR protein is not even in the cell. A possible explanation for this could be that the uncomplexed luxR has a repressing effect to some extent (Figure 5).

                                The robust Mantis reporter module aims to change the spontaneously activating quorum sensing system (Figure 5) into a system with proper antigen-dependent signaling behavior. To achieve this, the aiiA enzyme (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2387070">BBa_K2387070</A>) which catalyzes the degradation of N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), will be constitutively expressed.

Moreover, the lysis gene also removes the immunity protein from colicin protein, resulting in the activation of the endonuclease activity of colicin protein. In this case, the detachment of LysE7 from the Immunity protein is triggered, activating this the LysE7 endonuclease activity.

However, it was hypothesized that the only expression of E7 lysis gene (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K117000">BBa_K117000</A>) by <I>E. coli</I> DH5α , will cause partially lysis. The results indicated that E7 lysis protein might also have function in non-colicin-secreted strain of <I>E. coli</I> as the lysis was fully achieved after inducing the system (Figure 16) with L-Arabinose (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2387066">BBa_K2387066</A>). Future approaches could study the differences in the lytic effect by comparing the lysis achieved when inserting the pK317 plasmid which contains the entire LysE7 system and the inducible LysE7 system (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2387066">BBa_K2387066</A>).

T4 Holin effect is understandable as it makes the initial holes in the membrane and after holes are made in the membrane, T4 Endolysin is able to further increase bacterial membrane lysis breaking down the peptidoglycan layer [7]. 

                        </P><P>Based on the results, it was concluded that already low concentrations of L-Arabinose are able to induce a complete lysis of the bacterial cells (Figure 16). Either LysE7 system, T4 Endolysin + T4 Holin system or T4 Holin system alone could be implemented in the robust Mantis module (Figure 3). Based on the simplicity of the Inducible LysE7 system (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2387066">BBa_K2387066</A>) which only requires one gene to work compared with the double lytic casette (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2387079">BBa_K2387079</A>), this system (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2387066">BBa_K2387066</A>) was chosen when co-transforming strains in quenching experiments of the two interdependent components system

                            The final mechanism will be constituted by four modules (Figure 17) expressed by two different BCPs. Both BCPs will express the four modules, being all the modules the same except module 2 which will encode for component 1 in BCP1 and for component 2 in BCP2. In the system, aiiA will be constitutively expressed under no induction preventing quorum sensing from happening. In an induced state (antigen detected or L-Arabinose added to the medium), pBAD is activated leading to the expression of TetR which inhibits the expression of pTet resulting in the downregulation of aiiA. As a result, AHL degradation is decreased and the quorum sensing mechanism becomes active. The activation of the QS mechanisms leads to both the activation of the lytic mechanism as well as the activation of a positive feedback performed by the diffusion of AHL from cell-to-cell. In a final state, all the cells in the medium will lysed allowing component A to B to interact and generate a fluorescent signal.
