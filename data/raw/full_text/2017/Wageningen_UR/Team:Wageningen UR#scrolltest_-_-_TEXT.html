ODE model
The main goal of the simple model is to allow for a sampling of the parameter space of the kinetic rate constants of the model. To effectively do this, the biological picture has to be translated to mathematical equations. Furthermore, this model is more manageable and more straightforward to interpret when the number of kinetic parameters are low. To achieve this, the following assumptions have been made.
