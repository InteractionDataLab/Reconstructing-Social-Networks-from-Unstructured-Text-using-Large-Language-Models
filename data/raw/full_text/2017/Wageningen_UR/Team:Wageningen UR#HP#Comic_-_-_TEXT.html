Comic
The aim of this comic is to show people without a scientific background two different concepts around risk and safety in synthetic biology. First, not all genetically modified organisms are equally dangerous. Second, although the risk analysis of an organism might show that no dangerous effects are expected, it is important to consider the perception society has towards a new technology at the time safety measures are taken. This comic was shown in social engagement activities, such as the SynCity Festival and the RIVM Kennisparade , with good reception from the public. Click the image below to download the .pdf!
