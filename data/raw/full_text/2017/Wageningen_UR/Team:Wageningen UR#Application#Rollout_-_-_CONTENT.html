As shown on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Project" target="_blank">project page</A> there is a demand for accurate point-of-care diagnostics. But what steps need to be taken once it has been developed? How can you apply your diagnostic as efficiently as possible once an outbreak occurs? 

                            </P><P>In this roll-out plan, you will find a coherent summary of the best practices for implementing your novel diagnostic, and the current issues found in the field of point-of-care diagnostics. To find out about these problems, we talked to several renowned authorities with different expertises concerning diagnostics and epidemics and combined their insights into the following overview of how a roll-out plan for novel diagnostics could and should work. We were inspired by the thorough analysis of possible scenarios, such as those of <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris/Research#item-3https://2016.igem.org/Team:Pasteur_Paris/Research#item-3" target="_blank">iGEM Pasteur 2016</A>. Through this roll-out plan we aim to elaborate on their principle by incorporating our findings of the current practices. This way, we aim to help future iGEM teams by getting a clear overview of what human practices should be taken into account when designing and developing their new diagnostic.</P></DIV><SVG

                           The first signs of an epidemic are noticed, for example by an increase in the number of people showing certain symptoms in a certain area. Often, this is noticed by the local or national health centers.
                            When this is a new outbreak, little is known about the pathogen, vector, vector trajectory or the vulnerable target group. In the case of a re-emerging outbreak, these details are already familiar.

Develop the diagnostic</H2><P>When an official epidemic emerges, Mantis will be adapted to the new, spreading disease. During a new epidemic, the pathogen first has to be identified and isolated by authorized laboratories. The whole-cell biosensor can detect a pathogen by the antibody-like protein on its cell surface. This so-called ‘affinity body’ binds an antigen of the pathogen, whereafter the signalling system in the cell is activated, resulting in a detectable signal. The already made affinity body library, containing biosensors that theoretically can detect all possible pathogens, is screened for a suitable one for the new disease. This screening can be done within a few weeks. This selected sensor binds to the pathogen with the correct affinity and specificity. You can read <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Results/Affinity_Bodies"> here</A> how this screening is performed. That’s it! A new whole-cell diagnostic test is now made.
                        </P><P>After the Mantis biosensor is adapted to recognize the new pathogen, this initial strain will be shipped to the place where it is needed, for example to the central cell bank of a country. From there, the strain is maintained and used to grow the biosensor on a large scale. It can then be distributed accordingly to the remote areas. 
                        </P><P>When using the diagnostic test, the new cells are put into the Mantis device which gives a readout of the signal. This device contains, next to the disease-detecting cells, a negative control, and a positive control which detects IgG.

                                After the new Mantis biosensor is made, it is produced on large scale. The production of current diagnostic tests is mostly based on enzyme purification, which is costly in resources and time [1]. We learned from dr. Tatiana Mingote Ferreira de Azara, Health Surveillance Secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Health that the current production of diagnostic kits is not sufficient for the whole population of Brazil. A current bottleneck is thus the limited capacity of production, and not the costs. This means scale-up of the production process is an important factor to consider.</P><P>Since our biosensor does not need protein purification steps, this decreases its costs and production times. Hence, whole-cell biosensors are relatively easy and cheap to produce [2, 3]. For example, production and purification of antibodies can take up to 100 days [4], whereas a large batch of Mantis cells can be grown within a few days.

From there, the cells are grown in large culturing tanks, dried and aliquoted in vials, ready for transport to more rural medical facilities.

                            After production and preparation of Mantis from the central production plant, it has to reach the population residing in remote areas. After production and drying of the cells in health centers (see Step 3), the diagnostic is spread throughout the different tiers of the healthcare system [1] until reaching the local population. During the first-time distribution of Mantis in the area, the local facilities and field teams are supplied with both the Mantis device as well as the whole-cell Mantis biosensor. Owing to this model, only the biosensor itself needs to be shipped in subsequent rounds (aimed against the new disease), since the device is already present on-site.

                                            In Congo, health care starts in local health centres (centre-de-Sante) which have staff ranging from basic levels of training to full-fledged experts. Secondly, there are hospitals and clinics staffed by medical doctors, which often provide definitive treatment. Finally there is a national hospital in Kinshasa. During active case detection, mobile teams travel to urban neighbourhoods or villages in rural areas to test everyone. This is needed since 70% of the population lives in rural areas [2]. These mobile teams gather from a central point, e.g. local health centers, and go out with a four-wheel drive or motor bike for 20 days per month, testing around 6,000 people, depending on village sizes [3]. Mantis can be used for both passive case detection in local health centers with minimal facilities, as well as active screening by these mobile teams.</P><P>After independence of Congo in the 1960s, the healthcare system collapsed and the number of infected people increased significantly [4]. Although increasingly more effort is put into control of epidemics in Congo, the health system has collapsed again after recurrent political and social instability since the civil war (1997-2003). Some estimated 5 million deaths between 1997-2004 were attributable to treatable conditions. Currently, the Democratic Republic of Congo is war-torn between the governmental military and rebel groups. Medical Entomologist Jeanine Loonen told us that negotiation with all the involved parties is necessary to maintain a functional healthcare system and infrastructure in these areas.

                                            In the last decade the world's healthcare policy was focussed on the major infectious diseases HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, resulting in allocation of the funding for the goal of controlling these diseases [1]. Relatively unknown neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), like HAT, have been overlooked in financial support, partly due to their non-changing situation and seemingly low direct impact on population. Even though these NTDs are also in great need for funding, improving their situations is often more cost-effective and has added health benefits for the local society [2].

It could be, for example, disposed of incorrectly, causing damage to the environment. Furthermore, it could be used in unintended ways, such as for discriminatory purposes within a village. It is the responsibility of both the producer and end-user to avoid any misuse(s) of the device. To that end, the labels should include instructions on how to operate it, how to dispose of it and what kind of behaviour is not accepted (e.g. obligate people to submit to a diagnostic test). This is something we discovered during our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/HP/Ethics" target="_blank">ethics research</A>.</P><H4> Risks</H4><P>As Mantis is based on genetically modified bacteria, it is of the utmost importance to take measures that will avoid an accidental release of the bacteria into nature. How can this be done, when the developers are not the ones using the diagnostic in the field? Firstly, the healthcare personnel will be trained to correctly dispose the vials containing the bacteria. Secondly, a biocontainment mechanism will be implemented in the genetic material of the bacteria, which will prevent the uncontrolled spread of the bacteria in case of an accidental release. Finally, the risk of the bacteria affecting the environment in a detrimental way will be assessed beforehand, to determine that it fulfills the recommended standards. To learn more about biocontainment mechanisms and risk assessment, look on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Safety" target="_blank">biosafety page</A>.</P><H4> Autonomy of the patient</H4>
Even though we aim to keep all wishes of the patients into account when designing Mantis, we cannot influence whether they will use it or not. This is partly due to choices by health institutes that choose a specific diagnostic and due to the patient who can decide on being diagnosed or not. However, to what extent does this freedom of the patient go?

Depending on the status of a disease, however, local governments can take measures to separate a patient from healthy individuals. Nonetheless, this scenario is seldom applied, as the diseases for which these measures are allowed are extremely scarce in number. </LI></OL><P>Read our <B><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/HP/Ethics" target="_blank">ethics page</A></B> to see the complete story of how we came to these conclusions.</P></DIV><DIV id="Step9" class="Text-Box"><H2>Step 9.  Political impact on diagnostic availability</H2><P>In addition to approval of global healthcare organisations such as the FDA and WHO, implementation of a new diagnostic also requires governmental approval from the country it will be implemented in. This approval is based on trial results obtained during initial testing of the diagnostic during development. The specific requirements for a diagnostic to gain approval varies per country. Unfortunately, these regulations are lacking in strictness for a large number of countries. As a result, the wrong choice for diagnostics is easily made, resulting in costly mistakes in clinical decision making [1].  Especially in developing countries, these regulations are insufficient due to the absence of a qualitative good healthcare system. Mantis aims to improve this situation, by becoming an affordable alternative, while still retaining a high level of safety and well-documented regulation.</P><DIV class="Textbox Citations"><H5>References</H5><OL><LI>Peeling, R.

Treatment</H2><P>Once the tests have been performed, the group tested positively for the infections will be sent to the hospital for further testing and/or treatment. We found that this process could be improved in some situations. For example, the current tests for HAT are still troubled by a high false positive rate (up to 99%) and even false negatives [1]. This means that for all positively tested persons in a village, further testing is necessary through microscopic analysis on-site and extensive confirmation tests and staging in nearby hospitals. However, since many more patients are sent for further testing than is actually needed due to the false positive result of the screening test, this will increase costs for the involved NGO(s). According to dr. Philippe Büscher (Head of the Unit of Parasite Diagnostics, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp), the current treatment and healthcare costs are US$100-200 per patient. Therefore, by decreasing the number of false positives, a lot of money could be saved which can then be more efficiently spent to help those in need.</P><P>By making a more sensitive diagnostic test, we aim to reduce the number of false positives. Hereby, the costs for research, equipment and health care is also reduced, while still helping those in need!</P><DIV class="Textbox Citations"><H5>References</H5><OL><LI>Büscher, P., Cecchi, G., Jamonneau, V., &amp; Priotto, G.

Evaluation</H2><P>Diagnostic tests can be widely applied, e.g. for deciding on treatments for a patient, evaluating current interventions and for surveillance for disease presence (see below). However, this is not possible if the tool does not work properly! Not all diagnostic tests are suitable to be used in the field. To find out how the test can be best put into use, evaluation is necessary. Here, we address ‘outbreak-use’ diagnostics (OUDs), discuss the definition of an OUD and what its role is in tackling outbreaks of infectious diseases.</P><H4> Outbreak-use Diagnostics</H4><P>In the case of an emergency outbreak, the distribution of a safe and effective diagnostic to the patients in need is of the highest priority. Therefore a preliminary ‘outbreak-use’ diagnostic is developed and applied in the field as soon as possible [1]. This OUD is used to determine who is infected, how the disease is transmitted and how the disease is spreading. This data is of utmost importance for the development of containment strategies, and these can in turn be applied for limiting the number of casualties. </P><P>However, such a test has not gone through extensive performance trials yet. These trials would have taken valuable time during which the epidemic could have caused many victims.
Instead of figuring out all the best practices of the OUD during long clinical trials, the performance and main best practices are mainly discovered in the field in uncontrolled environments [1]. We learned that this is the scenario where Mantis can be applied best. </P><DIV class="expert-box"><H3 class="expert-name-left">Dr. Marianne van der Sande </H3><DIV class="expert-text-left"><DIV class="expert-title"><B> Head Epidemiology and Surveillance of Infective Diseases Center (EPI) and Center for Infectious Disease Control (CIb)</B></DIV><DIV class="expert-quote"><P><Q>A modular tool sees use when there is an outbreak of a pathogen where no convenient diagnostic already exists. The device should have advantages that make it attractive to use, for example cost-wise or through ease of use.</Q></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Through evaluation of these practices and the data on the health threat, diagnosis can be improved and the disease can be tackled more efficiently. Mantis facilitates collection and sharing of this data, by e.g. clear labeling and data storage on a SD card. See more on the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/Hardware" target="_blank">device page.</A> Gathering this test performance data also facilitates approval of the diagnostic for later use by the WHO [1]. </P><H4>Performance assessment of diagnostics</H4><P>How do you know if your OUD functions according to expectation? How can you ensure maximum specificity and robustness of your device? For this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines.</P><P>The basic requirements for a diagnostic test are collected in the ASSURED program (<B>A</B>ffordable, <B>S</B>ensitive, <B>S</B>pecific, <B>U</B>ser-friendly, <B>R</B>apid and robust, <B>E</B>quipment-free and <B>D</B>eliverable to end-users), developed by the WHO in 2003 [2]. If these criteria are met, the diagnostic can be applied for use in the local area. Performance tests are still required to improve its weak(er) points through a continuous feedback loop with the field team. A diagnostic test that would fit these demands would be of great value for neglected diseases like HAT [3].</P><DIV class="Textbox Citations"><H5>References</H5><OL><LI>WHO, <I>WHO to develop Essential Diagnostics List</I>, World Health Organization, 15 June 2017, www.who.int/medicines/news/2017/WHO_develop_essential_diagnostics_list/en/.</LI><LI>Cowan, Elliot P. <I>&quot;A framework for the assessment and implementation of diagnostics in outbreak situations.&quot;</I> African journal of laboratory medicine 5.3 (2016): 1-6.</LI><LI>Hannah Kettler, Karen White, Sarah Hawkes, <I>&quot;Mapping the landscape of diagnostics for     sexually transmitted infections&quot;</I> (2003)</LI></OL></DIV></DIV><DIV id="Step12" class="Text-Box"><H2>Step 12.  Monitoring</H2><P>Once an outbreak is over, one would conclude that the situation is relatively safe again and the danger of infection is minimized. However, the infective agent can always re-emerge and spread through the population again. To make sure these resurgences are noticed early on and handled quickly, detection kits are once again necessary. These are mainly used for ‘case finding’ in the population.</P><DIV class="expert-box"><H3 class="expert-name-left">Dr. Marianne van der Sande </H3><DIV class="expert-text-left"><DIV class="expert-title"><B> Head Epidemiology and Surveillance of Infective Diseases Center (EPI) and Center for Infectious Disease Control (CIb)</B></DIV><DIV class="expert-quote"><P><Q>After the big peak of the epidemiology, diagnostics are still applicable but only risk groups relevant for the disease will be diagnosed. This requires characterization of the disease.</Q></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>From dr. Marianne van der Sande we learned that it is hard to predict where an epidemic might reoccur. This is due to the fact that pathogens can have a diverse effect on each segregation of the human population, by the different genetic makeup of each different person and due to corresponding resistances.</P><P>When prevention of an outbreak is the goal of the diagnostic, the difficulty lies in funding. Preventing recurrence comes down to screening in the field with diagnostics which requires expertise and material over a long period. We learned from dr. Erwan Piriou that although plenty of funds become available for diagnosis and eventual medication when the epidemic is still relevant, it seems these funds are not available anymore once the danger has passed. This sadly results in recurring epidemics, which could have been prevented by more effective screening.</P><P>By building Mantis in a local community on low costs, and facilitating big data gathering, we hope to facilitate monitoring and make it more available for the public.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container-fluid FooterWrapper"><DIV class="FooterImage"><DIV class="col-lg-12 FooterMainColumn"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><DIV id="Footer"><P>iGEM Wageningen 2017.
