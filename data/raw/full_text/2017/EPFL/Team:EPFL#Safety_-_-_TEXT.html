Safety
Our lab is classified as a P1 as risk class, very little risk. However,    working in a laboratory means taking precautions. The first step towards good    lab safety are personal precautions such as wearing a closed lab coat, nitrile gloves    as well as safety goggles.   As we have been working with substances such as toluene    during the microfluidics experiments, it was important to wear double nitrile gloves    since toluene easily penetrates gloves. Manipulating such volatile substances is done    under a chemical fume hood. We start and end every experiment cleaning our bench with    alcohol (EtOH, 70%).
Every team member has followed a special biosafety training before starting to work in the lab.
