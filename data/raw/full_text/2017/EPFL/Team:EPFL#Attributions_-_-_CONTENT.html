    many decided to answer the call of what seemed to be the proposal of a great
    scientific and human venture. After a strict selection remained only nine immaculate
    souls; so the mystical core of the  iGEM EPFL 2017 team was formed. As soon as the members
    had obtained confirmation of their acceptation, brainstorming sessions were organised
    (as early as of February 2017) for several months in order to find a collectively
    acclaimed project. These meetings, coupled to extensive research on many cell-free papers,
    led us to focus on the usage of toehold switches and aptamers in cell lysates.
    From then on, the team quickly agreed to work on a biosensing device; thus our project <BIG>Aptasense</BIG> arose
    from the ashes. The iGEM EPFL 2017 team members interacted
    during the whole competition with many people affiliated to different scientific
    fields that contributed to shape the project into its final form. </P><H2 class="bottom-space top-space"><BIG>Team members</BIG></H2><H3>Lab work</H3><P>The whole team took part in either wet
    or dry lab sessions from February until
    the end of the competition. In order to optimize our work,
    several teams were formed:</P><P class="bottom-space top-space">The design of the parts was realised by
    <B>Lena, Lisa</B> and <B>Malek</B>.
    The publication of the parts in the correct plasmid backbone were realised by
    <B>Lena</B> and <B>Elia</B>.
    The work with aptamers was ensured by
    <B>Jonathan, Tim, Matteo</B> and <B>Felix</B>: <B>Tim</B> principally focused
    on running bead assays, whilst <B>Jonathan</B> and <B>Matteo</B> fabricated the
    very MITOMI chips they would later on use to perform their experiments with microfluidics,
    helped by <B>Felix</B> (who left in August but continued to perform the data
    analysis for the team).</P><P><B>Malek, Lena, Lisa</B> and <B>Elia</B>
    performed all research relative to cell lysates and toehold switches and were helped by <B>Natalija</B>
    in their investigation of toeholds.</P><P><B>Malek </B> and <B> Lisa</B> performed the trigger modularity experiments in PURE and cell lysates and tested the software output in vivo.

    </P><H3 class="bottom-space top-space">Software and wiki</H3><P>Everyone in the team participated in the
    writing of the texts for the wiki page of the team. The design of the logo was
    imagined by <B>Felix</B> and improved with the help of the rest of the team.</P><P><B>Lena</B> and <B>Tim</B> provided the
    MATLAB graphs sustaining capital information about our research. <B>Matteo</B>
    provided the R graphs for the binding saturation curves of the aptamers.</P><P><B>Matteo</B> and <B>Lena</B> facilitated
    the comprehension of the theory behind our manipulations by drawing complementary schemes.
    </P><P><B>Natalija</B> focused on building a solid foundation
    for our wiki page and on displaying all of our data on it; in addition to that,
    she managed to nearly single-handedly encode the
    toehold design program of the team and compute a novel toehold later proven functional.
    We thank <B>Prof. Dr. Alexander Green</B> for his feedback on the designed software.</P><H3 class="bottom-space top-space">Human practices &amp; Scientific outreach</H3><P>Many members of the team participated in several conventions
    and contributed to make the knowledge they acquired during the competition accessible
    to as many people as possible:</P><P><B>Malek</B> and <B> Lisa</B> joined a summer school in
    Davos, Switzerland, proposed by EPFL in which they presented the scientific investigation
    pursued in the lab.</P><P><B>Jonathan</B> and <B>Tim</B> represented iGEM EPFL 2017 in the
    iGEM European Meet-Up held in Delft, Netherlands.</P><P><B>Lena, Lisa</B> and <B>Felix</B> flew to Cambridge, Great Britain,
    in order to attend the Open Plant convention.</P><P><B>Elia</B> prepared the mini-kit, guaranteed its biological safety,
    its user-friendly facet, and wrote the associated protocols.</P><P><B>Jonathan</B> reached out to professors and administrators of
    distribution platforms in order to review and ensure the proper distribution of the kit after
    the end of the competition.</P><P><B>Elia</B> and <B>Tim</B> made contact with Medisupport in order to have inputs from the industry of diagnostics.</P><H3 class="bottom-space top-space">Collaborations</H3><P><B>Lena</B> was responsible for the numerous
    collaborations of the team with other iGEM teamslocated at different places across the world.</P><H2 class="bottom-space top-space"><BIG>Supervisors</BIG></H2><P><B>Prof. Dr. Sebastian Maerkl</B> and <B>Dr. Barbara Grisoni</B>, our two
    supervisors, stood by our side throughout the whole
    competition. They helped us with valuable advice, questioned and corrected our protocols
    and experiment designs when we didn't know what to do anymore. <B>Sebastian Maerkl</B>
    allowed the team to use all the equipment of the Laboratory of Biological Network characterization (LBNC)
    located at EPFL, which was crucial for our daily routine.</P><P> A huge thanks to our PhD advisors from Maerkl's lab, <B>Ekaterina Petrova</B> for all her advices on how to perform microfluidic assays, data analysis and on how to present our scientific data, <B>Zoe Swank</B> for helping us plot the graphs, providing counsel on MATLAB scripts and helping us manufacture the wafers we used for microfluidics assays, <B>Ivan Istomin</B> for his teaching of scientific rigorousness and how to make MITOMI chips, <B>Barbora Lavickova</B> for her vaste knowledge on cell-free expression systems, and <B> Gregoire Michielin</B> for all the help he provided on beads assays. They helped us with the countless problems we had in the lab along with a big support during the Wiki Freeze. 
We'd also like to thank the TAs for their generosity since we ended up using so much of their personal stashes that they have probably spent the last nine months eating plain pasta and 1 potato on special occasions.
