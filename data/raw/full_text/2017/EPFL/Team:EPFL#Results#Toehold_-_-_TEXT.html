Results
Over the summer, we went through a lot of experiments and generated many results.   The ones central to our project are analyzed below. Before we could start   experimenting with triggers and toeholds however, we had to learn a few things   about our cell-free reagents and how they are made. For this we got familiar with   making lysates and energy solution for cell-free extracts, as can be seen here . Once this basis was (somewhat) established,   we were able to go on with trigger/toehold reactions.
What was accomplished ?
In order to chronologically summarize our best accomplishments and discoveries    during the elaboration of our project before presenting our results, here is a list:
Testing RNA trigger with toehold in PURExpress, RNA titration.
Testing RNA trigger with toehold in lysate.
Successful α-complementation.
Testing toehold lacZalpha in lysate.
Testing short single stranded DNA triggers in lysate, short ssDNA titration
Testing short single stranded DNA triggers in lysate, long ssDNA titration
Testing aptamer trigger in PURE, aptamer trigger titration in PURExpress.
Testing aptamer trigger in lysate, aptamer trigger titration in lysate.
Successfully generating toeholds for Hepatitis C and testing them in our lysate.
In vitro transcription of trigger
In order to perform a toehold reaction, we first had to make the trigger.   To simulate the environment of viral RNA within a sample, an in vitro transcription was necessary to get the trigger as an RNA molecule. We consequently   purified the RNA trigger by LiCl2 precipitation   (see this protocol ).   The transcription product (both purified and unpurified) was then analyzed on   an Urea-PAGE gel.
Figure 1: Urea-PAGE gel of the in vitro transcription RNA product, RNA product of 391 base pairs and untranscribed DNA at 800 base pairs
We see the expected band of ~390 base pairs on the gel and can conclude that   we produced RNA trigger. The bands of the purified trigger are a lot fainter,   as expected.
Testing RNA trigger in PURE
Next we went on to test whether the transcribed RNA sequence would trigger the   toehold. For this we used in a first experiment a commercially available cell-free   synthesis system ( PURExpress , further simply called PURE).   The toehold was taken from the paper by Pardee et al 1 ,   number 27 from the B series. Reaction components were added as listed in the table   below and measured on a platereader at 37°C.

The toehold was triggered by the RNA trigger and beta-galactosidase expressed,   the solution in the tube changed colour from yellow to purple.
Testing RNA trigger in lysate
Upon those first encouraging results we decided to test the RNA trigger in our   own T7 M15 cell lysates to assess whether the switch works in our cell-free   expression system.
We incubated at 37°C the reactions listed in the tables below and recorded the   results after 1 hour of incubation:

Figure 3b: Toehold without RNA trigger cannot translate the lacZ gene downstream
In our self-made lysate the toehold was triggered by the RNA trigger and   beta-galactosidase expressed, the solution in the tube changed colour from   yellow to purple. This was a big result for us as it meant that we had   successfully repeated Pardee's 1 experiment!
Titration of RNA trigger
After successfully triggering the toehold in our cell-free lysates, we were   interested in the limit of detection of the RNA in our reaction i.e the minimal   quantity of RNA that would give us a colorimetric output detectable by eye.  To do so, we performed a titration of the in vitro transcribed RNA in PURE.

Figure 4b: End points measurements,taken after 6 hours of incubation
To summarize this result, we created the following titration curve :
Figure 5: RNA trigger titration curve in PURE
After assessing that the limit of detection was about 720 nm of RNA in this   experiment, we were interested in exploring this result and extrapolating it   to different nucleic triggers.
Alpha complementation
To get started, we first tried to prove that we can obtain a functional   beta-galactosidase starting from a T7 lacZ alpha DNA template added to the   T7 M15 lysate reaction.
Figure 6a: 1h incubation of T7 LacZalpha in T7 M15 lysate at 37°C
Figure 6b:1h incubation of no DNA control at 37°C
Testing LacZalpha toehold
After proving that alpha complementation worked in our cell-free platform,   we went on to test this concept for LacZ alpha contained in a toehold switch.
Figure 7:Left : Toehold lacZ alpha is triggered upon addition of the    ssDNA complementary sequence in T7 M15 lysate
Right : Toehold    LacZ alpha with no trigger added: the alpha part cannot be translated
We can see that the solution turned purple in the tube where trigger was added.   This means that a complete beta-galactosidase was present, indicating that the   toehold unfolded and LacZ alpha was translated.
Testing ssDNA triggers in lysate
Planning to use the toehold as signal relayer / signal transducer when an   aptamer pair detects a target protein, we wanted to have an idea on how a   single stranded DNA would interact with the toehold and quantify the detection   limits before exploring aptamer-toehold interactions.
To do so, we first tried to demonstrate that the toehold could be triggered by   single stranded DNA triggers of different lengths: a 36 base-pair single stranded   DNA (ssDNA short) which is exactly complementary to a sequence within the toehold   and a 90 base-pair single stranded DNA (ssDNA long) which has flanking bases   upstream and downstream of the complementary toehold sequence.

Figure 8c : Toehold remains folded when no trigger is added: beta-galactosidase is not expressed in T7M15 cell lysates
Titration of ssDNA short trigger in lysate
After showing that the single stranded DNA sequences triggered the toehold we   wanted to quantify the signal depending on the concentration of single stranded   DNA present in the sample.
We performed titrations of the single stranded DNA triggers in our own cell   lysates of T7M15 to assess the limit of detection of our system.
Figure 9a: ssDNA short titration in T7M15 cell lysates
Figure 9b: End points measurements after 6hours of incubation of ssDNA short and toehold at 37°C in T7M15 cell lysates
The signal was clearly different from the negative control for all of the   concentrations we tested. This implied that a concentration as little as   500nM is sufficient to trigger the toehold switch and produce the colour change.
Titration of ssDNA long trigger in lysate
The same titration experiment was performed to find the lowest trigger concentration   that could still achieve expression of beta-galactosidase.
Figure 10a: ssDNA long titration in T7M15 cell lysates
Figure 10b: End points measurements taken after 6hours
The results showed that the limit of detection of the ssDNA long trigger lies   at 2.5 µM. It suggested that the flanking bases upstream and downstream of the   ssDNA long sequence were interfering with the annealing of the trigger to the   toehold. This would then lead to lower sensitivity of the toehold in presence   of a trigger.
This presented a first insight into the fact that working with aptamers in   order to trigger the toehold may require higher aptamer concentrations,   because of the 3D conformation of the aptamer and the extra base pairs   upstream of the complementary sequence.
Zika 32B toehold
When the time came to start cloning, we wanted to test our cloning strategy   on another Zika toehold from Pardee's paper 1 .   We decided to go for the series B, number 32 toehold.
Figure 11: Expression of LacZ through Zika Toehold 32B in lysate
The 32B toehold expressed beta-galactosidase well and is in line with our   results found previously.
Aptamer trigger in PURE
After these encouraging results with using a single stranded DNA sequence as   a toehold trigger, we decided to use a ssDNA sequence bound to an aptamer for   our next experiment. We added the ssDNA short trigger sequence to one of the   aptamers used to detect our protein of interest.
This would give us first insight into how the detection scheme would work as a   whole, and whether the concentrations of aptamers needed to detect the target   protein would match that of trigger needed to unfold the toehold.
To answer those questions, we first performed an aptamer-trigger titration   in PURE.
Figure 12a: Aptamer-trigger titration in PURE
Figure 12b:End points measurements after 6 hours of incubation of aptamer-trigger and toehold at 37°C In PURE
Figure 13:Aptamer-trigger titration curve in PURE
The results above show that the limit of detection of aptamer trigger in PURE   is around 50 nM.
Titration of aptamer trigger in lysate
After those promising results, we performed the titration of the aptamer-trigger   in our T7M15 cell lysates to see if we could replicate similar results

Figure 14b: End points measurements were taken after 6 hours of incubation
The titration of aptamer trigger in T7M15 cell lysates showed that the limit   of detection was around 2.5 µM.
As a conclusion : We demonstrated that the toehold can be triggered by single   stranded DNA, RNA and aptamer triggers. We also characterized the limit of   detection of each trigger form.
Testing the softare : New Hepatitis C toeholds
Using the Toehold Designer, our software , we created four new toeholds   for Hepatitis C, genotype 1a. We decided to test our software for this particular   virus after having contacted professionals working   in the field as part of our Integrated Human Practices.
We performed the usual toehold reaction with those new toeholds : 10 µl reactions,   measuring absorbance at 595nm on a plate reader, at 37°C. Those reactions were all   set up as follows : 2.5 µl Energy Solution, 2.5 µl Buffer A, 2.5 µl lysate mix   (T7 M15 + Top10-GamS), as well as toehold (final concentration 4 nM), trigger    (final concentration 1 µM), substrate and water. Absorbance was measured on a   plate reader at 595nm and 37°C. Below: the four new toeholds compared and a   graph showing each toehold's efficiency separately.

All the toeholds generated by our software worked! A colour change visible by   eye was observed for every reaction. This result clearly demonstrated the   usefulness of our software and confirmed its efficiency. Shortly thereafter   we published the code to our software on GitHub to make it available to anyone   who wants to create new toehold switches!
