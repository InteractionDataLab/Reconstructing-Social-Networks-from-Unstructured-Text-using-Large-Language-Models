Our Contribution
We characterized the following parts in our self-made E. Coli lysates : BBa_E0040 and BBa_J64997 .
BBa_E0040 : Expression of GFP-mut3b in cell lysate
Cell-free GFP-mut3b synthesis was analyzed in self-made E. Coli lysate from strain BL21(DE3). Fluorescence was measured at 37°C for five hours on a plate reader. For details on how the lysate and the energy solution were made and which components went into the final reaction volume of 10uL, check out our protocols . Shown are three repeats with a negative control as well as a shaded error graph (control was subtracted) summarizing the result. GFP-mut3b expression yields high signals in lysate and thus is a good choice of reporter while working on a cell-free chassis. Saturation occurs after about five hours.

BBa_J64997 : Effect of a promoter on protein synthesis in cell-free expression systems
The T7 promoter was characterized in self-made E.Coli lysate from strain BL21(DE). Cell-free T7-GFP-mut3b versus GFP-mut3b (BBa_E0040) synthesis was analyzed. Fluorescence was measured at 37°C for five hours on a plate reader. For details on how the lysate and the energy solution were made and which components went into the final reaction volume of 10uL, check out our protocols . Shown are two times three repeats and a negative control, a shaded error graph (control was subtracted) and a bar plot summarizing the result.
GFP-mut3b expression cannot be dinstinguished from the no DNA control. T7-GFP-mut3b expression however is high. Saturation occurs after about five hours. Adding the T7 promoter in front of the GFP-mut3b enables transcription by the T7 polymerase, a much more efficient polymerase than the E.Coli polymerase found natively in E.Coli cells.
