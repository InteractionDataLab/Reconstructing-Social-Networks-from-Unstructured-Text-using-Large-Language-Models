Imaging on fluorescent microscope
Use the NIS program.
Align the chip on the microscope with the grid in the software. Make sure that every chip cell is in the field of view when selected from the grid in the software. Set the upper left chip cell as the reference point.
Choose the appropriate laser/channel for imaging.
Choose the exposure time in order to maximize the signal:noise ratio, not to saturate the camera, and not to photobleach the fluorophores.
Choose a filename.
Press “run now". The program should take an image of each cell in the chip.
When the image is created, select it and export it to a new folder using the “export ND document" option, under “export" in the “file » menu.
Select “mono image" and the name, then click “export ».
Open ImageJ. Go to “plugins", “stitching", “grid". Choose the grid size, no overlap, make sure “display fusion" is selected, and select the folder where you saved the image from the microscope. Choose a file name, but it must end in “xy{iii} ».
Once the stitched image is generated, scale it down by pressing ctrl-E.

Energy solution protocol
Materials
Procedure
Make amino acids stock solution
In one tube weigh each amino acid one by one using a small parafilm paper.
Add all the amino acids into the same tube apart from the tyrosine that should be added in a separate tube by itself.
To the first tube (amino acid – tyrosine ) add 500 ul of water in total: small volumes of water should be added periodically before adding the 500 ul total. After each addition check for the pH, it should be around 5-6. We can also add small volumes of KOH 1% (100 ul max) to dissolve the amino acids in the solution.
To the tyrosine only tube add 400 ul of water and 10 ul of KOH. Add those volume periodically while vortexing to help the amino acid dissolve in solution. The pH should be around 9.
Do not mix the two tubes together at this stage of the preparation to prevent precipitation.
Making energy solution
After preparing the amino acids, prepare the rest of the components by weighing each time the component in a tube and adding the amount of water listed in the table below. Vortex well so the component dissolves.
After weighing all the components, mix the amino acids and the rest of the solutions together, according to the table.

Bacteria growth
When working with bacteria, always work next to the flame to avoid contaminations and wear glasses when working with liquid nitrogen.
At 17h approximatively, add 5 ml of LB medium and antibiotics according to resistance’s cells to a tube and inoculate with a small amount of desired bacteria from the glycerol stock (pick by tip or inoculating loop). Put the top of the bottle of the LB and the cap under the flame to avoid contamination of LB medium (contaminate very easily).
Grow the culture overnight at 37°C, 200rpm, pay attention to keep the lid loose to allow for air exchange.
At 9h approximately, measure absorbance at 600 nm with 10X dilution of the culture (900 μl of LB + 100 μl of bacteria culture) in a plastic cuvette, OD600 should be around 4.
Add 1 ml overnight culture to 200 ml of LB medium and correct antibiotics in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask.
Incubate the culture for 2 hours at 37°C, 200 rpm (pay attention to the rpm setting – this speed is optimal for the growth).
Induce if necessary: 400 μl of 100 mM IPTG for T7 polymerase inducing; 5 ml of 10% arabinose for gamS inducing (under pBAD promoter).
Incubate again the culture for 2 hours at 37°C, 20 0rpm and measure absorbance, OD600 should be around 1.5 – 2.
Centrifugation and cleaning
Let the big centrifuge cool down to 4ºC (takes around 10 min).
Weigh one 50 ml falcon tube for one culture (clearly label the tube as well the cap).
Separate the grown culture to four 50 ml falcon tubes and spin at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min.
Keep the bacteria on ice as much as possible.
Discard the supernatant and add 10 ml of buffer A to the bacteria pellet, re-suspend the bacteria by pipetting or by vortexing and transfer all four parts to one tube, spin at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min.
Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 10 ml of buffer A, spin at 4000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min.
Re-do the washing step 6 one more times.

Sonication
Re-suspended the thawed bacteria based on their mass in buffer A by vortexing (1ml of buffer A + DTT per grams of thawed bacteria).
Keep the bacteria or lysate on ice as much as possible.
Aliquot 1 ml of re-suspended bacteria to a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube.
Place the tube in an ice bath (ice mixed with water) and place the sonicated tip inside the tube so it is immersed as much as possible in the liquid without touching the surface of the tube.
Sonicate with 50% amplitude and pulsing 10 s:10 s (energy : pause) until you reach 400 J (around 1 min and 24 s).
Separation
Let the small centrifuge cool down to 4ºC (takes around 20 min).
Centrifuge the lysed bacteria at 12000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min.
Transfer the supernatant (top layer) to a new tube. To prevent any transfer of bacteria debris, do not take all the lysate.
Place the lysate to an incubator at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 1h30 min, this run off reaction will lead to degradation of the rest of the DNA.
Centrifuge the run off reaction at 12000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube. As before, to prevent any transfer of bacteria debris, do not take all the lysate.
Aliquot the lysate to 0.5 ml microfuge tubes according to your needs (around 25 μl is recommended) and keep 1 μl of the lysate for the Bradford assay.
Flash freeze the aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C (wear glasses).
Bradford assay
Perform the Bradford assay to determine the protein concentration: dilute 1 μl of the lysate in 99 μl of buffer A
Mix 5 μl of the diluted lysate with 250 μl of the Bradford reagent.
Let the reaction incubate for 5 min
Measure the absorbance using the Nanodrop device, protein concentration should be between 400 and 800 μg/ml

For the control layer, 60 g of a 5:1 Sylgard mixture (50 g Part A:10 g Part B) is prepared, mixed for 1 minute at 2,000 rpm (~400 × g) and degassed for 2 minutes at 2,200 rpm (~440 × g) in a centrifugal mixer.
Prepare in a plastic cup, cover in parafilm, and launch centrifugal mixer (program is preset).
The mixture is poured onto the control layer mold and degassed in a vacuum desiccator for 10 min.
Pour as close to the mold as possible to avoid air bubbles.
For the flow layer, 21 g of a 20:1 Sylgard mixture (20 g Part A: 1 g Part B) is prepared, mixed for 1 minute at 2,000 rpm (~400 × g) and degassed for 2 minutes at 2,200 rpm (~440 × g) in a centrifugal mixer.
The mixture is spin coated onto the flow layer with:
15 seconds ramp, 2800 RPM, 30 seconds dwell
20 seconds ramp, 100 rpm, 1 second dwell
0.1 second ramp, 100 rpm, 0 dwell
After removing the control layer mold from the vacuum chamber any residual surface bubbles are destroyed by blowing on top of the PDMS layer. Any visible particles on top of the control channel grid are carefully removed by blowing on them with a pasteur pipette.
Both layers are cured in an oven for 20-30 minutes at 80°C.
Following polymerization, both molds are taken from the oven and allowed to cool for 5 minutes.
The control layer is then diced with a scalpel and holes (1–8 and B, S, C, O) are punched at the control input side using a hole puncher or a 21 gauge lure stub.
The channel side of the control layer is thoroughly cleaned with Scotch Magic Tape.
The cleaned control layer is then aligned to the flow layer on the stereomicroscope.
The device is bonded for 90 minutes at 80°C in an oven.
Bonded devices are removed from the oven and allowed to cool for 5 minutes.
Following the outline of the control layer each individual device is cut with a scalpel and peeled off the flow layer.
Holes are punched for the sample inlet and outlet (S1–S7 and O) using a hole puncher, and the chip is cut along the alignment crosses.
The flow channel side is cleaned thoroughly with tape before aligning the device to a spotted glass slide.
Flow mold is cleaned of any residual polymerized PDMS either by peeling off the thin layer of PDMS using a pair of tweezers or by an additional PDMS layer. For the latter, 11 g of a 10:1 Sylgard mixture (10 g Part A:1 g Part B) is mixed for 1 minute at 2,000 rpm (~400 × g), degassed for 2 minute at 2,200 rpm (~440 × g), poured on the flow mold cured in the oven for 30 minute at 80°C, and peeled off after cooling down to room temperature. The control mold is cleaned with a nitrogen air gun of any PDMS debris.

PAGE Urea gel
Materials
Urea (7M)
40% Acryl/Bisacryl
10x TBE (Tris/Borate/EDTA) buffer
Water (tap)
TEMED (Tetramethylethylenediamine)
30%(w/v) APS (Ammonium Persulfate)
Gel Cast
Incubator
SYBER_SAFE box
Gel red DNA stain (10’000x)
UV transilluminator
Mini-PROTEAN System
Procedure
Set up
Generally, we prepare more than one gel in case one leaks.
Make sure every component is washed and cleaned properly.
Beforehand, align the small glass and the bigger glass (the little one should face towards you) in the green clasps on an even surface.
Close the clasps to fixate the glasses and snap it into the big plastic stand (fits two gel next to each other).
Put the gel cast under the laminar hood.
Gel preparation
To prepare the gel add the following to a 50ml falcon tube (calculations for 2 gels):
6.72 g of 7M urea
5.3 ml of 40% Acryl/Bisacryl
1.4 ml of 10X TBE
1.4ml of water
5.6 μl of TEMED (will be added after microwave)
46.2 μl of 30%(w/v) APS
For a total volume of 14 ml.
Add everything expect the TEMED and the 30% APS and heat it up in the microwave for about 10 seconds (the tube should be clear).
TIP: let the tube in the microwave for 3-4 secondes, take it out and shake it again for 3-4 secondes.
Under the laminar hood
Add the TEMED second to last and the 30% APS last as the reaction starts quickly after you add those components.
Gently let the gel mixture flow between the two thin glasses. Add the gel comb. Nothing should spill down.
Let it solidify for about 5 minutes.
Unclip the gels from the clasps and gently.
Wash the glasses with water to remove the urea (make sure not to move the glasses, make sure that no water enter).
Put the glasses into the cassette (movable green sides to fixate the glasses securely).
N.B: If you are only running one gel, you should add a little plastic space holder so the space inside the cassette is safely closed.
Fill the inside of the cassette with 1X TBE Buffer. Nothing should leak.
Put the cassette into the big plastic container used to run the gel and fill this with 1X TBE buffer until the 2 gels mark.
Wash the wells with the 1xTBE buffer already in the gel cassette.
Let the gel pre run in the incubator for 1 to 2 hours at 300V. (Temperature of the gel should be between 40 and 60°C).
Sample preparation
In a 200 μl PCR tube, put 2 μl of the 2X RNA loading dye and 2 μl of the desired sample or ladder.
It helps to put some dye on the side of the gel (first and last well) to have the samples in between the dye as it protects the RNA.
Let the reaction run for 28 minutes at 300V.
Put 100 ml of 1x TBE buffer to the SYBER_SAFE box and add 10 μl of the gel red stain.
Wash the gel. Slowly take the glasses from the sides (be careful, it can break easily), remove the gel and place it in a plastic container.
Add 1x TBE buffer to wash it (shake for 2 minutes).
Rewash and reshake for another two minutes.
Place the gel inside the SYBER_SAFE box and let it shake for 30 minutes.

References to other protocols
Lysate protocol
Energy solution protocol
Buffer A protocol
Procedure
For 10 μl lysate reaction with linear DNA templates:
Configure the platereader program and start preheating the machine to 29°C. Usually, the platereader measure all the wells for 6 hours.
Prepare mastermix. For one reaction:
2.5 μl energy solution
2.5 μl lysate
2.5 μl buffer A
0.3 μl gamS
1.7 μl $H_2O$
Prepare a mixture of everything minus the DNA — if 10 reactions will be running, prepare a mixture that would give enough for 10.5 reactions to account for some pipetting errors (if different volumes/concentrations of DNA are added to each reaction then prepare a mixture of everything minus the DNA and the water).
Notes:
For different final concentrations of DNA, calculate new volume to be added and compensate by adding more or less $H_2O$ to make the final reaction volume equal to 10 μl
For reactions with plasmid DNA rather than linear templates, exclude the gamS and compensate with $H_2O$
In order to have cheaper experiment, instead of using gamS protein, use Top10-gamS cells lysate (Top10 cells transformed with gamS gene)
Aliquot 9.5 μl of mastermix in wells of the plate (Nunc 384) in one corner of the wells.
Add 0.5 μl of 100 nM DNA template (final concentration of DNA = 5 nM) to the other corner of the well.
Centrifuge the plate for a short time (30-60 seconds) to remove any bubbles and collect the solutions at the bottom of the wells.
Add 35 μl of wax to each well.
Centrifuge again.
Load the plate and start the platereader program.
