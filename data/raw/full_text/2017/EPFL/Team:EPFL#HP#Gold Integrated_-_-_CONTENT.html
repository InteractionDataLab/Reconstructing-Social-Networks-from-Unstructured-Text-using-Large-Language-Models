We took part in a one-day workshop to integrate cell-free biology in high school curricula. As a result, a complete ‘toolbox’, the<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:EPFL/HP/Mini-Kit"> Educational Cell-Free Mini-Kit</A>, that swiss high school teachers could include into their classes, was developed.  However, we have no knowledge and experience in curriculum organisation which is why we got in touch with several high school teachers. We introduced them to our project and our experimental mini-kit and asked them for feedback on how it could be improved. Based on their opinion we adapted and changed the Educational Cell-Free Mini-Kit (ECFK) so that it eventually could be included in the official high school curriculum in biology.</P><P><I>&quot;Votre projet me paraît passionnant et je serais très heureux de parler avec vous des implications et applications dans les classes.

			we reached out to EPFL's biosafety department to make sure we were complying with 
			national safety requirements. Stéphane Karlen, the main coordinator for biological 
			safety on campus, made a risk evaluation of the kit and concluded that the Cell-Free 
			Educational Mini-Kit does not represent a risk for the user or the environment.

			reaction components, ideal to show a range of biomolecular processes upon rehydration. 
			At the same time it is equipped with a detailed description of the experiments that 
			could be performed with it as well as suggestions as to which topics a biology teacher 
			could cover with them. The Cell-Free Educational Mini-Kit is a diverse toolbox suitable 
			for demonstrating biological principles to all age groups, as the teacher is free to 
			provide the students with an adequate background for their grade level. </P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><P> The Cell-Free Mini-Kit includes the material and experimental setup for the

			components needed for the Mini-Kit, in a sustainable way that will last 
			longer than just the duration of this year's iGEM project. It was clear 
			that after November 2017, our team would not have access to the lab spaces 
			anymore and we would therefore not be able to deliver components of the Cell-Free 
			Mini-Kit ourselves. We looked into more details for the following two solutions: 
			<UL style="list-style:disc"><LI>Having one of the labs at EPFL produce the lysate and energy solution 
					(for example within the scope of the laboratory initiation course for 
					second year students at the faculty of Life Sciences) </LI><LI>Contacting the company responsible for delivering laboratory material 
					 to the high schools directly</LI></UL></P><P> It was the second point that caught our attention after the meeting with the 
			teachers. They gave us the contacts of <A href="https://www.bioutils.ch/" target="_blank">BiOutils</A> 
			(french for bio-tools), whose mission it is to support the teaching of modern 
			biology at local high schools and supply them with the material and competences needed. 
			We have established a collaboration with BiOutils: we are at the moment in discussion with them and exchanging the protocols for 
			lysate production and energy solution, to see when and how it would be possible for
			them to produce all the components of the Cell-Free Mini-Kit on a larger scale and supply the 
		        high schools directly once the iGEM competition will be over. This solution is definitely the most satisfying 
		        as the Mini-Kit will enter a list of supported cantonal experiments for high 
		        schools and biology teachers in all of Geneva would be able to order it and use 
		 	it in their class.</P><P> We are very glad to have found such broad support and interest in the idea of 
			our Cell-Free Educational Mini-Kit and hope that it will become permanently 
			integrated in local high school curricula. <B>With the help of BiOutils, the Mini-Kit would be produced on a larger scale and will be accessible for every high school in the region. Its future use will be ensured even after the Jamboree and will create a long lasting impact on education.</B></P><H3><CENTER>How do you asure that it will be appropriate for students ?</CENTER></H3><P> Our interactions with the high school teachers were very valuable in order for us to 
			gather opinions and reactions towards the Mini-Kit we wanted to propose. After exchanging 
			the protocols with the teachers from Collège Calvin, they suggested to us that 
			lyophilisation of the components would not be needed, as they were equipped to 
			directly manipulate the solutions. They told us that it would be better for the 
			course since the students would be the ones pipetting the solutions and preparing 
			the mixtures and that it would make the Mini-Kit more interactive. We of course 
			agree with this statement and went on to modify our Cell-Free Educational Mini-Kit 
			protocols to include manipulation of the solutions directly and describe which amounts of reagents would be needed for delivery. Hence, after this discussion, we now propose two different kits: one lyophilised, to facilitate storage in high schools lacking the necessary facilities, and one non lyophilised, for high schools that have access to pipettes and adequate storage units. 
 We managed to include many other aspects of the teachers' feedback into our Minikit, although two of them persist until now: The central questions of each experiment might be a bit too easy for high school students and it would be great to have two versions of the instructions, one for the students and one for the teacher.</P><P> After the visit, the two teachers told us they were very eager to try out a test kit such as to integrate the kit before the end of the ongoing semester in February. We promised to provide them with five test kits as soon as we come back from the Giant Jamboree in Boston so that they could get started with experiments!</P><P> The company BiOutils wanted to know how the individual components could be 
			synthesized or produced, as they would be taking over this part for the high schools. 
			We quickly provided them with our detailed protocols on how to make lysate, which 
			cell lines are optimal for cell-free protein expression, how to prepare the energy 
			solution and which substrates and buffers are needed for the reactions.
		</P><P> After an hour-long conversation and several e-mails exchanged with the 
			<A href="https://www.ecolemoser.ch//" target="_blank">École Moser</A>in Geneva, 
			we had established that École Moser would like to include the Cell-Free Mini-Kit 
			in their curriculum but could only do so once the next academic year begins 
			(starting Summer 2018). They are also being supplied by BiOutils and asked us if 
			it were possible to expand the Mini-Kit with certain experiments for more advanced 
			biology courses. This suggestion was very welcome and we set out to write 
			a manual that may serve as a road-map for generating new Mini-Kit experiments. At the 
			moment we are discussing which experiments would be most useful and 
			how to realize those with the Mini-Kit.

		Medisupport, a laboratory group that performs a broad range of medical analyses 
		for hospitals and doctors' offices, servicing Switzerland in it's entirety. As they are

		came to EPFL to meet with one of our team members and discuss our diagnostics 
		tool in greater detail. After two hours of discussion, Medisupport told us they 
		would want to put us in contact with one of their geneticists. Hence, the 
		following week, we had a second meeting and they gave us more details about 
		the project's outlook and how it could be improved.</P><P>They found the general idea quite ambitious and new, which was one of our goals. 
		However, as they understand the world of diagnostics well they told us that it is 
		extremely difficult to implement a new tool because of the trust that we must have 
		in the results given by the diagnostic tool. Hence, it requires a vast series of 
		tests that we couldn’t achieve considering the time and ressources available. 
		Thus, one anther field to reach was the food industry as the testing methods are less developped. 
		Concerning the diagnostic field, Aptasense could have a future in liquid biopsy for 
		detecting tumoral DNA in blood or detecting bacterial markers/activity, considering that the methods 
		used nowadays are quite expensive. In conclusion, it was a great opportunity to meet with 
		them and to have the possibility to implement their advices.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
