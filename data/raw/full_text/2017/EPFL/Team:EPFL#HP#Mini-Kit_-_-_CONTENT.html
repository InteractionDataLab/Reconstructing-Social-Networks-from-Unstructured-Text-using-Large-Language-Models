		 the Cell-Free Mini Kit intended for demonstrations at local high schools. Furthermore, doing an educational 
                 kit relying on the cell-free technic for protein expression systems would offer the great advantage of cheap, 
                 simple experiences and the possibility to easily store the kit. Hence,in August, the team reached out to 
                 several high schools located nearby EPFL to ensure they had interests in our kit and that they would add it 
                 to their classes. A few days later we received encouraging responses from two high schools in Geneva, College 
		 Calvin and Ecole Moser, who told us to provide them with a more detailed proposal as soon as we would have it 
                 ready. </P><P>The ECFK consists of several tubes containing different lysate reaction components, ideal to show a range of biomolecular processes. There are two kits: one of them is freeze dried, which enables simpler manipulations and storage for high schools with low budget; the other one isn't freeze dried, which enables students to learn how to pipette correctly and perform more elaborate experiments. The mini kit also contains a detailed description of the experiments that can be performed with it as well as suggestions of topics (such as cell-free biology) that the teacher could find interesting to include in his biology lectures. In fact, the ECFK is a diverse toolbox suitable for the demonstration of biological principles to groups with basic knowledge in biology, as the teacher is free to provide the students with an adequate background for their grade level. </P><P>After having set our mind on what the Cell-Free Mini Kit should look like in the end, 
			we reached out to EPFL's biosafety department to make sure we were complying with 
			national safety requirements. Stéphane Karlen, the main coordinator for biological 
			safety on campus, made a risk evaluation of the kit and concluded that the Cell-Free 
			Educational Mini Kit didn't represent a risk for the user nor the environment.

		integration of the Cell-Free Educational Mini Kit in their high school's biology 
		curriculum. We gave them a live demonstration of the experiments provided by the 
		Mini Kit and discussed the impact it would have on the high school courses of their students. 
		The conversation was very interesting, as we were until that very moment not sure how well 
		the high school labs were equipped - would they have micro-pipets, -80°C freezers, 
		incubators? The teachers were glad to respond to all of our questions, were very 
		enthusiastic and already gave us a first feedback. In fact, instead of working with 
		freeze-dried components, they taught us that many high schools have the capacity to handle the components 
		in their fluid form as their labs have micro-pipets and access to -80°C freezers; we thus adapted our 
                protocols in order to render the mini kit suitable for such handling. We managed to include many other aspects of their feedback into our Minikit, although two of them persist until now: The central questions of each experiment might be a bit too easy for high school students and it would be great to have two versions of the instructions, one for the students and one for the teacher.</P><P><I>&quot;Votre projet me paraît passionnant et je serais très heureux de parler avec vous des implications et applications dans les classes.

			components needed for the Mini Kit for high schools in a sustainable way that would last 
			long after the end of iGEM 2017 competition. The team will indeed not have access to the lab spaces 
			anymore after November 2017 and will therefore not be able to manufacture and deliver components of 
                        the Cell-Free Mini Kit. We looked into more details for the following two solutions: 
			<UL style="list-style:disc"><LI>Having one of the labs at EPFL produce the lysate and energy solution; for example, as suggested by our supervisors themselves, within the scope of the laboratory initiation course for 
					second year students at the faculty of Life Sciences, which would have made our project worth of a whole set of in-lab practical sessions at EPFL</LI><LI>Contacting the company responsible for delivering laboratory materials 
					 to the high schools</LI></UL></P><P> The second point caught our attention after the meeting with the 
			teachers. They gave us the contacts of <A href="https://www.bioutils.ch/" target="_blank">BiOutils</A> 
-			(french for bio-tools), whose mission is to promote the teaching of modern 
			biology at local high schools and supply them with the required materials and competences. 
			We have established a collaboration with BiOutils: we currently are in contact with this platform and 
                        are exchanging protocols for lysate production and energy solution in order to make the
			to production and supply of all the components of the Cell-Free Mini Kit for high schools on a larger 
                        scale achievable once the iGEM competition will be over. This solution fits our expectancies for the 
                        mini kit in the most 
                        satisfactory way as it will then enter a list of supported cantonal experiments for high 
		        schools, and biology teachers of the whole Canton of Geneva would be able to order and use 
		 	the ECFK in their class.</P><FIGURE><P> We are very glad to have found such broad support and interest in the idea of 
			our Cell-Free Educational Mini Kit and continue to work in the hope that it will become permanently 
			integrated in local high school curricula. <B>With the help of BiOutils, the Mini Kit will be produced on a larger scale and will be accessible for every high school in the region. Its future use will be ensured after the Jamboree and will, so do we hope, create a long lasting impact on education by generating infatuation for little known science fields amongst high school students in addition to bringing cell-free biology into swiss educational systems.</B></P><H2 class="top-space bottom-space">Feedback</H2><P> Our interactions with the high school teachers were very valuable for us to 
			gather opinions and reactions in regard to the Mini Kit we wanted to propose. After exchanging 
			the protocols with the teachers from College Calvin, they suggested to us that 
			lyophilisation of the components would not be needed, as they were equipped to 
			directly manipulate the solutions. They told us that it would be better for the 
			course since the students would be the ones pipetting the solutions and preparing 
			the mixtures and that it would make the Mini Kit more interactive. We of course 
			agreed with this statement and went on to modify our Cell-Free Educational Mini Kit 
			protocols to include manipulation of the solutions directly and describe the amounts of reagents needed for delivery. Hence, after this discussion, we now propose two different kits: one lyophilised, enabling easy storage for low ressources high schools, and one non-lyophilised, for high schools that could have access to pipettes and adequate storage facilities for the kit. </P><P> After the visit, the two teachers told us they were very eager to try out a test-kit such as to integrate the kit before the current school high school semester ends in February. We promised to provide them with five test kits as soon as we would come back from the Giant Jamboree in Boston so that they could get started with experiments!
		</P><P> The company BiOutils wanted to know how the individual components could be 
			synthesized or produced, as they would taking over this part for the high schools. 
			We quickly provided them with our detailed protocols on how to make lysate, which 
			cell lines are optimal for cell-free protein expression, how to prepare the energy 
			solution and which substrates and buffers are needed for the reactions.
		</P><P> After an hour-long conversation and several e-mails exchanged with the 
			<A href="https://www.ecolemoser.ch//" target="_blank">Ecole Moser</A>in Geneva, 
			we had established that Ecole Moser would like to include the Cell-Free Mini Kit 
			in their curriculum but could only do so once the next academic year begins 
			(starting Summer 2018). They are also being supplied by BiOutils and asked us if 
			it were possible to expand the Mini Kit with certain experiments for more advanced 
			biology courses. This suggestion was very much welcomed by us and we set out to write 
			a manual that may serve as a roadmap for generating new mini kit experiments. At the 
			moment we are discussing with them the experiments of the mini kit they find most useful and the way 
                        to realise them.
