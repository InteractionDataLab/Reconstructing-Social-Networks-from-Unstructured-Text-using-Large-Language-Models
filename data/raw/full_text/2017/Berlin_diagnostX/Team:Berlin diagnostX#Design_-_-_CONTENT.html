depending on the presence or absence of specific trigger RNA. </P><P class="text-justify">They consist of:</P><OL><LI> a specific single-stranded toehold sequence</LI><LI> a ribosome-binding site (RBS)</LI><LI> a coding sequence for the reporter protein. </LI></OL><P class="text-justify">The reporter protein can only be produced if the toehold domain (recognition site) of the sensor has bound to its specific trigger RNA sequence. In absence of trigger RNA, the toehold switch forms a hairpin structure that prevents the ribosome from binding to the RBS, and thereby the translation (production of the reporter protein) can’t be initiated. </P><P class="text-justify">However, an RNA sensor alone is not sufficient for a screening test. Naked RNA cannot produce a protein nor induce a colour change – we thus relied on cell-free expression systems, a synthetic alternative to cell culture providing both easy handling as well as a controlled micro-environment for synthetic biology. </P><H5 class="text-center pb-1"><STRONG>Basics: Cell free expression system</STRONG></H5><P class="text-justify"> A cell free expression system is a system allowing for the production of protein using biological machinery without the use of living cells.

For this reason one of our main goals was to shed light into the transcriptome of T. solium with a special focus on T. solium eggs, which are excreted with stool and easily accessible for diagnosis.  
We reached this goal by obtaining raw RNAseq data of the whole worm from GEO database (GSM2227058) and mapped it against a published genome of T. solium (PRJNA170813). We identified 215 potential targets for sensor development by mapping the transcripts against tapeworms that our test should not detect (like T.asiatica and T.saginata)</P><P class="text-justify">&gt;&gt; Click on the picture to discover our targets on an interactive map!
Despite this first success we continued our efforts describe the transcriptome of eggs from T. solium for the first time, since RNA expression in eggs may differ from the whole organism.

Analysing existing toehold sensors to extract basic switch design </H5><P class="text-justify">Using recent publications on toehold switches [1, 2], a text editor (Sublime Text Editor) and the “Analysis” function of the NUPACK software, we identified the most promising basic structural units:</P><UL><LI>a 36-nt long recognition site of which the first 25 nucleotides are unpaired (toehold domain)</LI><LI>a 11-nt long bottom stem complementary to the toehold domain</LI><LI>a 5-nt long top stem complementary to the toehold domain</LI><LI>12-nt long hairpin loop containing the RBS (ribosomal binding site) and connecting the bottom &amp; top stem</LI><LI>3-nt long bulge containing the start-codon for the translation of the reporter protein (located between the top and bottom stem) </LI><LI>22-nt long linking sequence (consisting of a variable &amp; an invariable domain) attaching the reporter protein sequence (LacZ) to the bottom stem thus providing an open reading frame in combination with the 11-nt long bottom stem.</LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-5"><DIV class="col-6"><H5 class="igem_blue text-center pb-4">2. Optimizing the switch design </H5><P class="text-justify">We used the “Multitube-Design” function of the NUPACK software and optimized the secondary structure towards the desired “toehold structure”.

Automating the switch design </H5><P class="text-center">To compute an optimal toehold-sensor for each 36-nt long target RNA sequence, we wrote a Python-Script.

Selecting promising switches for screening</H5><P class="text-justify">The python script generates almost N possible sensors for a target sequence of length N, a number far too large be entirely synthesized and screened.  Thus, a selection step prior to in vitro testing of the sensors was introduced: We selected candidates by their normalized ensemble defect (NED). The NED is a parameter used by the NUPACK software and describes the difference between the most probable secondary structure of each sensor candidate and the desired secondary structure (classic toehold structure). </P></DIV><DIV class="col-6"><H5 class="igem_blue text-center pb-4">5. Optimizing switch selection </H5><P class="text-justify"> We improved selection step by adding further criteria, adapted from the original publication [1]: we considered not only the normalized ensemble defect (NED) but also the “single-strandedness” of both the toehold region and the target RNA. “Single-strandedness” describes the probabilities of finding unpaired nucleotides in a sequence of a given length. We established a scoring system rating each sensor candidate in terms of </P><OL><LI>The local single-strandedness of the target mRNA at the binding site.</LI><LI>The local single-strandedness of the toehold of the sensor</LI><LI>The normalized ensemble defect (NED) of the sensor</LI></OL><P class="text-justify">The score was calculated as follows:</P><P class="text-center"><B>Score = 5 * (1) + 4 * (2) + 3 * (3)</B></P><P class="text-justify">The sensors with the lowest score were then select as the most promising sensors for synthesis and screening.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" id="team1"><DIV class="col-12"><H3 class="text-center igem_blue mb-3">Team 1: Sensor Synthesis </H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-5"><DIV class="col-6"><H5 class="igem_blue text-center pb-4">Initial approach: Extension PCR</H5><P class="text-justify"><OL><LI>In a first step, the core sensor is amplified from a circular DNA template.</LI><LI>In two PCR-based steps, the recognition and hairpin region was attached to a LacZ reporter element, using primers specifically designed for each individual sensor.  <B>(P1 &amp; P2)</B></LI><LI>In a third PCR step, the sensors were purified and a t7 promoter region was added. <B>(P3)</B></LI></OL></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-5"><DIV class="col-6"><H5 class="igem_blue text-center pb-4">Optimization of the PCR protocol: Nested PCR </H5><P class="text-justify">The assembly of the RNA sensors via extension PCR usually requires two PCR steps in order to amplify the core sensor and furnish it with a LacZ reporter element.The approach of nested PCR can reduce this to one PCR cycle, reducing time and the amount of non-specific PCR products.

Establishing the CFE system: </H5><P class="text-justify">Using the published Zika Virus Sensor [1], we established a protocol to screen toehold sensors with a cell free expression system. Before adding the sensor to the expression system, it is mixed with chlorphenol-red – a yellow dye that in the presence of the enzyme beta-galactosidase changes its color to violet. During contact with a specific trigger RNA, the toehold sensor RNA unfolds and translates the sequence for beta-galactosidase into protein, leading to a color change from yellow to violet. Thus, we can analyze the efficiency of our sensors by the amount of color change in a defined time.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-5"><DIV class="col-6"><H5 class="igem_blue text-center pb-4">2. Screening of Tso_31 Sensors : </H5><P class="text-justify">We started our quest for a sensor specific for Taenia solium with sensors targeting the published T. solium antigen Tso_31 [3].

Optimizing CFE system using Zika sensor: </H5><P class="text-justify">We went back to an established toehold sensor (the aforementioned) Zika Virus sensor in order to improve experimental conditions. We tested several concentrations, different buffers as well as different temperatures and concluded that the ideal sensor concentration lies between 0.625 nM and 6.24 nM. In all further screenings, we used 3 nM – a concentration adequate for a novel, non-optimized sensor candidate.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-5"><DIV class="col-6"><H5 class="igem_blue text-center pb-4">4. Screening Tsm Sensors:</H5><P class="text-justify">We now had all parameters in place for a high-throughput screening of novel sensors.

Efforts to immobilize the CFE on membranes</H5><P class="text-justify">In order to use our testing device in the field, the CFE system needs to be transportable, storable and highly stable. We aimed to achieve this by freeze-drying the CFE system onto a cellulose membrane. The membrane-CFE complex would then be storable and could easily be resuspended with liquid whenever needed. By several optimization steps, we obtained a protocol which reduces non-specific interactions between CFE and membrane. We succeeded in freeze-drying and reactivating the complex.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row mt-5"><DIV class="col-12 summarybox p-4 "><H3 class="text-center mb-1"><STRONG>Summary</STRONG></H3><P class="text-justify">In order to develop a diagnostic tool for the tapeworm infection Taeniasis, we developed a pipeline that allowed for designing, synthesizing and testing any given sensor within 2 days. <STRONG>Step 1: In silico design</STRONG></P><UL><LI>Design of a toehold switch sensor specific to T. solium RNA</LI><LI>Generating primers necessary for switch synthesis</LI></UL><P class="text-justify"><STRONG>Step 2: DNA-Switch Synthesis</STRONG></P><UL><LI>By using extension PCR or nested PCR, the toehold switches were synthesized</LI><LI>Reporter gene (Beta-galactosidase) and T7 promoter were added to the sensor</LI></UL><P class="text-justify"><STRONG>Step 3: Sensor Screening</STRONG></P><UL><LI>Transcription of DNA sensor into RNA takes place in CFE system</LI><LI>Specific binding of RNA sensor to trigger RNA leads to translation of reporter gene in CFE system</LI><LI>By measuring absorption at 560 nm, color change was measured and enzymatic reaction quantified</LI></UL><P class="text-justify">Splitting the work into three teams enabled us to work continuously – trouble shooting in one team did not stall work in the other teams.

We thus investigated fixing the system onto cellulose membranes, making it storable, durable and easily transportable.
