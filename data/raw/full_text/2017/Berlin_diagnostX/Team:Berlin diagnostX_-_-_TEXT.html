The fight against T. solium
The worldwide fight against Taenia solium  (pork tapeworm) is facing three different challenges
HIGH PREVALENCE
Estimated billions are affected - the infection causing epilepsy, blindness and death
INSUFFICIENT DRUG DISTRIBUTION
Although affordable therapeutics exist, they don't reach patients in infectious hotspots
EXPENSIVE DIAGNOSTICS
No methods suited for field use are yet available preventing the identification of infectious hotspots
The vision of diagnost-x
Developing a low cost, easy-to-handle diagnostic test for infection with the tapeworm Taenia solium
Target Identification
We sequenced 96 million RNAs  and mapped them against about 12.000 Genes of T. saginata,  T. asiatica and T. solium. The expression level of unique RNAs was analyzed. We identified 215 unique, potential diagnost-x targets.
The colour intensity is proportional to the expression of each identified possible target.

Sensor Design
Based on the analysis of the build-plan of different published toehold sensors, our In Silico Team generated a first generation of switches. Further optimisation based on testing results let us to the establishment of our software for in silico design. Selected Switches were furthermore tested in the following testing pipeline.

Sensor Screening
The designed switches from the In Silico Team were assembled using Extension PCR. Assembled Sensors passed all through the standard screening in liquid phase.

Considerating future application from Day 1
Developing a diagnostic test needs careful consideration of the circumstances in which the toll will be used - therefore we spared no expense and investigated local circumstances in India.

Raising awareness for T. solium
Neglected Tropical Diseases have few platforms in the eastern world since they don't affect people directly. Our mission was to raise  awareness for NTDs and provide innovative impulses for the education of a new generation.
