To proof that the created sensors do not only work in a defined environment that only requires the sensor to distinguish between water, a single trigger RNA and a single unspecific RNA, we imitated the realistic working environment. We added a full transcriptome of tapeworm RNA to the sensor reaction. This mixture contained millions of different RNAs. Our sensors were still able to identify TSM target reliably.
