The Wise Guys
No Music – But Outstanding Scientific Supervision
Prof. Markus Schuelke, MD
Professor for Developmental Disorders of the Nervous System, Department of Neuropediatrics and NeuroCure Clinical Research Center, Charité Berlin
Laboratory PI and Supervisor of the iGEM team – interested in all aspects of human genetics, bioinformatics, and gene technology with a proclivity for Chinese characters and playing Spanish classical guitar if not in the lab.
I support the iGEM group because it is a pleasure to support and observe the future generation of scientists to unleash their creativity and team spirit to solve an urgent global health need.
Prof. Dr. Achim Kramer
Professor of Chronobiology at the Institute for Medical Immunology (IMI), Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin
Since 2007 Professor of Chronobiology at the Institute for Medical Immunology (IMI), Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin and head of the working Group for Chronobiology. His main areas of research cover the molecular basics of the circadian clockwork in mammals and their impact on physiological and behavioral processes. His working Group mainly focuses on the characterization of post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms essential for the dynamics ofcircadian oscillations and thereby for physiology and behavior.
Prof. Dr. med. Hans-Dieter Volk
Director of the Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin
Director of the "Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies"
Director of the Department of Immunology of the Labor Berlin-Charité Vivantes GmbH
His main areas of research are immunology and regenerative medicine. Taking a translational approach, Hans-Dieter Volk combines basic and clinical research in immunology. This has allowed him and his team to develop new diagnostic products and therapies for immune diseases, which are already on the market. His research work focuses on the development of biomarkers, transplantation immunology, the immunopathogenesis of virus infections of the herpes group of viruses, and the role of inhibitory cytokines and regulatory T cells. "I support the iGEM team because they showed remarkable efforts and self-initiative to solve a public health problem with new ideas."
