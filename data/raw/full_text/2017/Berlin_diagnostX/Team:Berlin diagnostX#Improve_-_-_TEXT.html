BBa_K1586003
The Exeter iGEM team worked in 2015 with toehold sensors as well. Since their switch was not characterised in vitro yet, we modified our trusted approach of testing toehold sensors to work with GFP. We modified our protocol in the following ways:
using black 384-well plates in our plate reader (Glomax Discover, Promega)
measuring fluorescence by excitation at 395nm and measuring emission at 509nm
using GFP with an appended T7-Promotor as positive control
Because the sensor was not available for order through iGEM, we ordered the sensor and its respective trigger RNA with an appended T7-Promotor for our experiments. You can find the ordered DNA Sequences at the registry
