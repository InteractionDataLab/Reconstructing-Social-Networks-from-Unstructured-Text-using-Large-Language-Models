Given enough time we could have built D.I.V.E.R.T. step by step: first finding a setting for efficient reverse transcription and reintegration prior to combining the optimized components and trying to translate the results to other host organisms in the end. Anyhow, we had to resort to a different strategy to get the most out of the time and resources we had to our hands by following both a scientific/systematic as well as a “hope for a lucky shot” approach. On the systematic side of things we wanted to lay a foundation for potential future work by trying to find decent priming conditions for reverse transcription with MMLV RT in <EM>E. coli</EM> (see <A href="#Priming" class="page-scroll">here</A>). In terms of reintegration we are confident that the well-established FLP/FRT-mediated recombination system would do the job. However, as mentioned in the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna/Description">theory section</A>, FRT sites are palindromic and form stable hairpins possibly impairing transcription (and reverse transcription). To assess the severity of this potential problem we conducted terminator strength measurements with an FRT site in sense and antisense orientation (see <A href="#FRT" class="page-scroll">here</A>).</P><P>Besides this more systematic approach we still wanted to take our chances by building a D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette as well as a helper construct (carrying the RT, FLP and the primer cassettes) according to the best of our knowledge and see whether it worked. We attempted to do this for both <EM>S. cerevisiae</EM> and <EM>E. coli. </EM>(see <A href="#DIVERT" class="page-scroll">here</A>)</P><P>As described in the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna/Description">theory section</A>, our proof of concept assay involves an intron oriented in antisense direction in perspective to the GOI and in sense direction in perspective to the retroelement that is only spliced out of the retroelement mRNA ultimately yielding selectable colonies. Since there is no splicing in prokaryotes we had to find and adopt a self-splicing ribozyme to implement this assay in <EM>E. coli</EM> (see <A href="#ribozyme" class="page-scroll">here</A>).</P><P>The proof of concept assay requires the D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette to be bidirectional (as an additional advantage this also prevents the RT from bumping into ribosomes in <EM>E. coli</EM>) resulting in a somewhat more intricate genetic construct (see <A href="#DIVERT" class="page-scroll">here</A>, figure 1) that would have been troublesome to create via classic cloning techniques and better suited for gene synthesis. As most regulatory sequences (promoters and terminators) available for <EM>S. cerevisiae</EM> are rather long (~ 200 to 750 bp) we turned to relatively recently published short synthetic regulatory elements<SUP>1–3</SUP> to keep the synthesized construct short. The synthetic galactose-inducible minimal promoter we used (sequence retrieved from <SUP>3</SUP>) was characterized and sent to iGEM to expand the range of inducible yeast promoters available in the registry (see <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna/Basic_Part">here</A>).</P><P>Details on the experiments conducted in the course of the generation of our CRISPR/Cas9 plug and play plasmids can be found <A href="#CRISPR" class="page-scroll">here</A>.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="DIVERT" class="container content-section text-center"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><H3>Our shot at D.I.v.e.r.t.</H3><P>As argued in the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna/Description">theory section</A> there are several options available for accomplishing the main processes necessary for completing the D.I.V.E.R.T. cycle (i.e. reverse transcription and recombination). Lacking the time to systematically optimize the different components we still wanted to try our luck by designing the system in a way that deemed most promising in the light of the information we had gathered during the planning phase. The experimental as well as genetic construct designs for yeast and <EM>E. coli</EM> are described below. For both hosts we chose to use RNA oligonucleotides transcribed <EM>in trans</EM> to prime reverse transcription and the FLP/FRT recombinase system for reintegration.</P><H4><I>E. Coli</I></H4><P><U>The plan</U>For our D.I.V.E.R.T. approach we planned on integrating 2 constructs into the <EM>E. coli</EM> chromosome: the D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette and a helper construct carrying the components required for reverse transcription and reintegration. Both integration cassettes were flanked with terminators to insulate them from nearby genomic transcription. As integration loci we picked IS6 from Bassalo et al.<SUP>4</SUP> for the D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette and <EM>lacZ</EM> for the helper construct. Homologies measured 200 bp per arm outside of which we placed BsmBI recognition sites for scarless release of the fragment to be integrated from the Golden Gate backbone it was constructed in.</P><P><U>Building the D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette</U></P><I><DIV style="font-size:80%;">Figure 1: Features of the <I>E. coli</I> D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette and proof of concept assay (T, P, PBS, RBS, FRT, ampR correspond to terminator, promoter, primer binding site, ribosomal binding site, FRT site, beta-lactamase)  
</DIV></I><P style="text-align: justify;">The proof of concept D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette for use in <EM>E. coli</EM> contains a beta-lactamase gene (referred to as <EM>amp<SUP>R</SUP></EM>) disrupted by a self-splicing intron in reverse orientation (<EM>Figure 1</EM>; details on intron design can be found <A href="#ribozyme" class="page-scroll">here</A>). Upon transcription from promoter 1 (P1) the mRNA carries <EM>amp<SUP>R</SUP></EM> in sense direction which leads to non‑functional protein as the ribozyme won’t splice due to being reversely oriented. Upon transcription from inducible promoter 2 (P2) the mRNA carries the beta-lactamase gene in antisense direction enabling the ribozyme to splice itself out. The spliced RNA should then be reverse transcribed and reintegrated into the genome replacing the original copy leading to functional beta-lactamase. Hence, only full completion of the D.I.V.E.R.T. cycle should yield ampicillin resistant cells. The D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette was synthesized as a single gBlock by IDT and inserted into a Backbone 3 of our Golden Gate standard (<A href="#BB3_02" class="bgscroll">BB3_02</A>). Instead of a GOI the gBlock contains a spacer sequence that can be replaced by any CDS in another Golden Gate reaction (with BpiI). Since the cassette was intended to be integrated we picked a strong constitutive promoter as P1 (BBa_J23100) to maintain high expression levels although the GOI would be present only in a single copy. However, all the backbones of our Golden Gate standard featured the high-copy pUC origin of replication leading to substantial stress on the cells during cloning of constructs containing strong constitutive promoters. To accommodate to this challenge we changed P1 to weaker BBa_23108 (<A href="#BB3_09" class="bgscroll">BB3_09</A>). Inserting the disrupted beta-lactamase gene with FRT sites at both ends (FRTwt upstream, FRT3<SUP>5</SUP> downstream) into BB3_09 gave <A href="#BB3_43" class="bgscroll"> BB3_43</A>. For P2 we selected a stronger version of the arabinose-inducible pBAD promoter (BBa_K206000).</P><P><U>Builing the helper construct</U></P><P style="text-align: justify;">The helper construct for <EM>E. coli</EM> (<A href="#BB3_01" class="bgscroll">BB3_01</A>) was to be created from 3 fragments:</P><P><UL class="ulclass"><LI>• gBlock 1: upstream <EM>lacZ </EM>homology, insulating terminators, cassette for transcription of primer 1</LI><LI>• <A href="#BB2_08" class="bgscroll"> BB2_08</A>: pBAD-RT-FLP. RT and FLP were obtained via IDT gBlocks, cloned into BB1s and combined to a bicistronic cassette using PCRs and Golden Gate.</LI><LI>• gBlock 2: cassette for transcription of primer 2, insulating terminators, downstream <EM>lacZ</EM> homology</LI></UL></P><P style="text-align: justify;">The design allowed for subsequent exchange of the primer cassettes using BpiI (primer 1) or AscI/AflII (primer 2). To ensure defined 3’ ends the primers were attached to the HDV self-cleaving ribozyme. The sequence was taken from Gao et al.<SUP>6</SUP></P><P style="text-align: justify;">To our surprise, we had a really hard time obtaining positive colonies in the final cloning step of <A href="#BB3_01" class="bgscroll">BB3_01</A>. After having tried everything in our repertoire (lower regeneration/cultivation temepratures, pre-ligation of the fragments prior to insertion into the isolated empty backbone) without success, subsequent investigations revealed that the primer+HDV expression cassettes – which were featuring BBa_J23102, another rather strong constitutive promoter – were quite toxic for<EM>E. coli.</EM> While showing reduced growth carrying plasmids with only one primer cassette, the cells would not grow at all when both cassettes were present on the same plasmid. Again we had to resort to a weaker promoter (also BBa_J23105) to obtain positive clones (<A href="#BB3_35" class="bgscroll">BB3_35</A>).</P><P><U>Ready for integration - but not ready to integrate</U></P><P style="text-align: justify;">With plasmids carrying both constructs at our hands we were set to finally integrate. However, our plug and play CRISPR/Cas9 was not (details in the <A href="#CRISPR" class="page-scroll">CRISPR section</A>). We had fatally underestimated the toxicity of leaky gene regulation when both the gene for Cas9 as well as for a functional sgRNA are present in the same cell. Hence, it took several generations of CRISPR plasmids to come up with a solution that was not too toxic for cells to grow in liquid culture but still lethal enough to screen for recombinants when induced.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">So, we had to set aside the idea of integration and started to think about trying plasmid‑borne D.I.V.E.R.T. We already had everything we needed on 2 plasmids, but those shared the same origin of replication potentially leading to plasmid loss or other adverse events. To tackle this problem we amplified the origin of pSIM5<SUP>7</SUP> (the only origin from another compatibility group available to as at the time; details on pSIM5 can be found in the <A href="#CRISPR" class="page-scroll">CRISPR section</A>) and used it to build another backbone that was employed in the “speziale” plasmid series.</P><P><U>The final test</U></P><P style="text-align: justify;">An overnight culture of <EM>E. coli</EM> DH10B carrying <A href="#BB3_35 Speziale" class="bgscroll"> BB3_35 Speziale</A> and <A href="#BB3_43" class="bgscroll"> BB3_43</A> was diluted to an OD of 1 and induced with 0.2 % arabinose. 100 µL of cells were plated on LB Amp<SUP>+</SUP> (100 µg/mL) after 6 and after 20 hours.

We intended to delete the generic URA3 gene of SC288 via integration of the helper construct to generate the auxotroph. This way we could apply positive selection<SUP>8</SUP> on the integration of the helper construct and create the auxotrophy we need for the D.I.V.E.R.T. assay, hence “killing two birds with one stone”. We disrupted our URA3 gene with an intron in reverse orientation, analogous to the self-splicing ribozyme in the D.I.V.E.R.T. assay for <EM>E. coli</EM>.</LI><LI>• To prevent the yeast cells from processing the primers like an mRNA we used the RNA polymerase III promoter from the snoRNA SNR52 gene and SUP4 terminator as described by DiCarlo et al. who applied those for transcription of their sgRNAs<SUP>9</SUP>.</LI><LI>• We used longer homology arms ranging from 500 to 800 bp out of which SmaI recognition sites were incorporated for linearization and release of the fragment up for integration.

Maybe the RNAP III promoter from SNR52 exhibits cryptic promoter activity in <EM>E. coli</EM> leading toxic effects of the transcribed RNAs. Remarkably, all constructs we had problems with expressed high levels of short RNAs carrying the HDV ribozyme. Anyhow, to deal with this problem we ordered new gBlocks featuring primer cassettes with pSynGal instead of pSNR52 but the first attempts also failed. We then realized that trying to resolve this mystery would not leave us with enough time to integrate twice and stopped working on our D.I.V.E.R.T. in yeast approach.

Nowadays markerless selection can be applied using CRISPR/Cas9, but there was no non-commercial plug and play solution available to us. So we decided to build our own CRISPR/Cas9 system.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">Most publications on CRISPR-enhanced chromosomal integration in <EM>E. coli</EM> (for example <SUP>4,12–18</SUP>) roughly follow the same procedure employing Cas9 and sgRNA on 2 different plasmids:</P><OL class="“ulclass“"><LI style="text-align: justify;">A recombination plasmid is transformed into the cells.</LI><LI style="text-align: justify;">The plasmid carrying Cas9 is transformed into the cells.</LI><LI style="text-align: justify;">The donor DNA as well as the plasmid carrying the sgRNA are electroporated into the cells.</LI><LI style="text-align: justify;">While regenerating, expression of the inducible component of CRISPR is activated.</LI><LI style="text-align: justify;">After regeneration cells are plated on selective agar for the gRNA vector.</LI><LI style="text-align: justify;">Colonies are screened for positive recombinants using colony PCR.</LI></OL><P style="text-align: justify;">We wondered whether it was possible to have sgRNA and Cas9 expression cassettes on the same plasmid to cut down from 3 to 2 transformations and decided to try. To provide convenient plasmid‑curing we used temperature sensitive replicons amplified from pSIM5 (pSC101, dependent on RepA) or pSIM9 (RK2/oriV, dependent on trfA) which we obtained from the Striedner group (see <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna/Attributions">attributions page</A>)<SUP>7</SUP>.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">As those origins confer low copy numbers<SUP>19–21</SUP> we at first reasoned that adding the regulatory protein to the plasmid might not be necessary and generated <A href="#C-PPP_01" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_01</A> (<U>C</U>RISPR <U>p</U>lug and <U>p</U>lay <U>p</U>lasmid) without araC in spite of using the (truncated) araBAD promoter to induce Cas9 (sgRNA was constitutively transcribed from BBa_J23100). We thought that leaky expression could not impose a problem as <EM>E. coli</EM> DH10B lacks AraC<SUP>22</SUP> which is necessary for even lowest levels of expression (<SUP>23</SUP> and the references therein) with the negative side effect that this would also render our plasmid useless for integration in an <EM>E. coli </EM>strain lacking <EM>araC</EM>. Anyhow, we were able to obtain colonies carrying <A href="#C-PPP_01" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_01</A>, but as soon as we inserted a target sequence into the sgRNA cassette the only positive clones that grew in liquid culture contained an indel in the target sequence indicating that cells with the correct target were killed by leaky expression.</P><P style="text-align: justify;"><A href="#C-PPP_04" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_04</A> also contained <EM>araC</EM>, however not in conjunction with full-length pBAD like <EM>in situ</EM> in wild type <EM>E. coli</EM> but as separate parts due to the modular assembly of the plasmid. Again, we were not able to obtain functional plasmid carrying an unmutated target sequence.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">To minimize background expression we exchanged the promoter of the sgRNA (BBa_J23100) with a shorter version of pBAD and additionally added a very weak constitutive promoter (BBa_J23109) directly after the sgRNA in reverse orientation to quench uninduced sgRNA levels with RNA interference yielding <A href="#C-PPP_07" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_07</A>. With this setup we finally obtained colonies carrying functional plasmids including the targeting sgRNAs. Using the RNAi approach we also created <A href="#C-PPP_10" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_10</A> additionally comprising all lambda Red functions offering the possibility to use one single plasmid for integration.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">When trying to integrate (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BOKU-Vienna/Protocol#CRISPR">protocol integration</A>) our <EM>E. coli </EM>D.I.V.E.R.T. cassette using cells carrying CPPP_09 (i.e. <A href="#C-PPP_07" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_07</A> targeting IS6) and pSIM9 or only CPPP_12 (i.e. <A href="#C-PPP_10" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_10</A> targeting IS6), however, yielded no positive recombinants out of 50 colonies tested. Apparently, CRISPR-mediated selection was not stringent enough which could be confirmed by lethality tests yielding unsatisfying ~ 10<SUP>-2</SUP> surviving cells for both plasmids. Lambda Red mediated dsDNA integration gives about 10<SUP>-4</SUP> positive recombinants per cell<SUP>7</SUP> requiring CRISPR induced lethality to be at least in the same range for efficient selection.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">With those results in mind we figured that arabinose induced sgRNA expression was too low to sufficiently overshoot RNA interference conferred by the antisense sgRNA transcribed from BBa_J23109. Moreover, we had been using a HDV ribozyme downstream of the sgRNA to provide a defined 3’ end which might not be necessary and could in fact even reduce efficiency as we did not incorporate flexible linker regions between the RNA structural elements (sgRNA scaffold, HDV ribozyme, terminator). Hence, we resolved to build a library of plasmids containing all meaningful combinations of</P><UL class="“ulclass“"><LI>• with/ without RNAi (using the even weaker constitutive antisense promoter BBa_J23103)</LI><LI>• with/ without HDV ribozyme</LI><LI>• with/ without lambda Red functions</LI></UL><P style="text-align: justify;">consisting of 8 plasmids (<A href="#C-PPP_13" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_13</A>–<A href="#C-PPP_34" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_34</A>).</P><P style="text-align: justify;">Around that time we also started to specifically search for single-plasmid <EM>E. coli</EM> CRISPR systems and found Zhao et al.<SUP>24</SUP> who reported that they similarly had had initial problems with leaky Cas9/sgRNA expression until they started using generic full-length pBAD + <EM>araC</EM> additionally applying further repression by growing cells on 1 % glucose. Adopting their strategy we created <A href="#C-PPP_37" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_37</A> and CPPP_39 (targeting IS6).</P><P style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, in the time available we were not able to generate all 8 plasmids of the library but only <A href="#C-PPP_22" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_22</A> and <A href="#C-PPP_28" class="bgscroll"> CPPP_28</A> (corresponding to CPPP_24 and CPPP_30 targeting IS6). Both plasmids showed adequate lethality about 10<SUP>-4</SUP>. To facilitate less laborious screening we constructed a fragment containing the IS6 homologies enclosing eGFP under control of the BBa_J23100 promoter which was used for integration by means of CPPP_39 + pSIM9, CPPP_24 and CPPP_30.</P><P style="text-align: justify;">No colonies obtained from the integration reactions showed fluorescence under blue light. We decided to nevertheless perform 40 colony PCRs (with primers binding on the chromosome just outside of the homology arms) per CRISPR plasmid since a single GFP copy might not produce enough protein to be detected with the naked eye. For CPPP_24 and CPPP_30 no positive clones were identified while CPPP_39 + pSIM9 yielded almost 10 % (3/40 colonies) recombinants <NOBR>(Figure 2).</NOBR></P><I><DIV style="font-size:80%;">Figure 2: Colony PCRs of our integration experiments.

For the proof of concept for D.I.V.E.R.T. an antibiotic resistance disrupted by a reversely oriented intron is required. While in yeast there are plenty of well-described introns to choose from, in <I>E. coli</I> information is rarer. However, scientists already discovered group I and group II introns working in prokaryotes as well. For example, the Tetrahymena group I intron, a self-splicing ribozyme, is proven to exhibit splicing activity <I>in vivo</I> in <I>E. coli</I> without the expression of additional factors<SUP>29</SUP>. In contrast to other self-splicing ribozymes the Tetrahymena group I intron is very well-described and can be engineered to cut itself scarlessly from any suitable sequence. For exact recognition of the splicing sites intron-exon pairing in the P1 and P10 (paired region 1 and 10) regions is necessary<SUP>30</SUP>. P1 determines the 5’ end of the self-splicing ribozyme and contains P1ex, which has considerable influence on splicing activity. P10 pairs with a sequence at the 5' end of the exon and therefore defines the 3’ end of the intron (<NOBR><I>Figure 5</I></NOBR>). Although P1 and P10 mark the opposite ends of the intron, they are both located in the same region and it is worth noticing that they can overlap.
</P><I><DIV style="font-size:80%;">Figure 5: Tetrahymena wt precursor mRNA. Exon bases are written in lowercase, the Tetrahymena group I intron bases in capital letters. A part of the P1 region is complementary to the 5’ exon sequence determining the 5’ end of the intron, whereas the P10 region is determining the 3’ end.
</DIV></I><P><U>Selection of an antibiotic resistance:</U>
For the Tetrahymena group I intron Guo et al. proposed in their publication<SUP>31</SUP> that the 5’ adjacent exon sequence of the mRNA should consist of 5'-CUCUCU-3'. Considering this and the requirement of the intron being on the antisense strand we were looking for an antibiotic resistance gene featuring 5'-AGAGAG-3' (reverse complementary to 5'-CUCUCU-3') somewhere in the CDS. We finally found a β-lactamase gene with a 5'-AGAGAA-3' sequence approximately in the middle of the gene<SUP>32</SUP>. By introducing a silent mutation (A357G) the desired 5’ adjacent exon sequence was obtained. Furthermore, a BsaI recognition site was silently mutated to comply with our Golden Gate-cloning standard.
</P><P><U>Design of the self-splicing ribozyme:</U>When engineering the Tetrahymena group I intron to splice itself from a foreign gene, the design of P1 and P10 is crucial to preserve self-splicing activity: The P10  region was exchanged for bases complementary to the 3’ adjacent exon sequence of the new β-lactamase gene. Because P1ex and P10 are overlapping, P1 was altered as well. Additionally, as Guo et al. suggest<SUP>31</SUP>, a non-complementary base pair was introduced in the P1ex sequence to promote splicing activity (<NOBR><I>Figure 6</I></NOBR>). </P><I><DIV style="font-size:80%;">Figure 6: Design of the precursor mRNA of the β-lactamase gene with the engineered Tetrahymena intron .

To test if the ampicillin resistance is still functional, this modified gene was cloned into an expression vector (<A href="#BB3_04" class="bgscroll">BB3_04</A>). After subsequent transformation into <I>E. Coli</I>, cells were plated on LB low salt agar with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. After an overnight incubation ampicillin resistant colonies were visible. For verification a colony was picked and its plasmid was purified and the insert sequenced.</P><DIV id="BB3_06" class="modalDialog "><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A></DIV></DIV><DIV id="BB3_04" class="modalDialog "><DIV><A href="#close" title="Close" class="close">X</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="References" class="container content-section text-center"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><H3>References</H3><P style="font-size:70%;">[1]: Guo Z, Sherman F.
