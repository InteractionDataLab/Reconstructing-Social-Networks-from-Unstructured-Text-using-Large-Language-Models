In the course of our project we were able to conduct experiments never done before. However, in order to do so a base of knowledge and resources is required. Fortunately we encountered many ambitious people who supported us. We want to thank them all for kindly helping us during our project.
• Diethard Mattanovich, Brigitte Gasser, Michael Sauer and Hans Marx: organization of the iGEM project
• Gabi Wilt ordered materials for our team
• Corinna Rebnegger helped us doing flow cytometric experiments for characterization of our pGAL syn
• Tom Gaßler advice on setting up our CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene integration in S. cerevisiae by supporting us with primers for assembling the specific sgRNAs
(adapted from Stovicek 2015).
• Martin Altvater: provided us with different plasmids for Saccharomyces cerevisiae ready for our Golden Gate system
• Jürgen Zanghellini supported us with modeling
• Florian Strobl advice and lab material
• Gerald Striedner and Esther Egger provided us with the pSIM 5 and pSIM 9 plasmids
• Franziska Doleschal organized our bank account and managed all our invoices
• Anna Gindl designed our Logo
• Nikolaus Huber helped us setting up the core code of our wiki page
• Sauer group provided us BB1_01 – BB1_08
• Mattanovich/ Gasser group provided us material, all empty BBs for the Golden Gate system and many protocols:
• Preparation chemical competent E. coli
• Transformation chemical competent E. coli
• Preparation of electro competent S. cerevisiae
• Transformation of electro competent S. cerevisiae
• mRNA extraction
• Bernd Albrecht helped us doing the RT screenings on the Flow cytometer, by setting up the right parameters.
• STV LBT helped us organizing the "Spritzerstand"
Furthermore, we want to thank Matthias Steiger, Alexandra Graf, Stefanie Wiesauer, Christiane Veit, Gordana Wozniak-Knopp, Siniša Petrik, Roland Prielhofer, Hannes Rußmayer, Michael Egermeier, Valeria Ellena, Lina Heistinger, Dominik Jeschek, Richard Zahrl, Ursula Kieswetter and many more!
