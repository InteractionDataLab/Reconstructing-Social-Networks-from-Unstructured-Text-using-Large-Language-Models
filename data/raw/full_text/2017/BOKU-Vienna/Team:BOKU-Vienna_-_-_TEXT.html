We are  proud  and  happy  to  say that we had the opportunity to attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston and that  our  efforts  were  rewarded  in form  of  a Silver  Medal! By participating in the iGEM competition we definitely learned a lot and are honored to be a part of the ever-growing synthetic biology community.
