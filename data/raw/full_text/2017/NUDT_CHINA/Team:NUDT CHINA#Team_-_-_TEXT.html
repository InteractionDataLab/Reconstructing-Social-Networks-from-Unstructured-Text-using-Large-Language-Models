My name is Chushu Zhu. I come from a beautiful city named Lishui, located in Zhejiang China. Frankly speaking, iGEM plays an indispensable role in my college life as it’s my third time to participate in it. However, I still feel a little nervous at the beginning because I am the team leader of NUDT_CHINA this year. Fortunately, I got a lot of encouragement from my lovely teammates, which is very helpful. Synthetic biology is so magical, and my teammates’ brilliant ideas win my great admiration as well. This project offers us a good chance to give full play to our creativity, intelligence and diligence.
My name is Chuanyang Liu, 21 years old, born in Suizhou, a small and beautiful city located in Hubei China. I major in chemistry. This is my first time to participate in iGEM. I think iGEM gives me a wonderful platform full of passion and creativity. It’s a marvelous experience to be a member of IGEM synthetic biology team. Students from various specialties cluster together for one purpose. we discuss together, brainstorm ideas together, learn experimental technology together and make progress together. Everyone in those days have learnt a lot from each other. I love IGEM, I love my team.
My name is Lijiao, He. I come from Yunnan, China, which is called the plant and animal kingdom. When I was a kid, I was curious about insects and flowers and thought that what led to the vitality of diversity. Out of favor of biology, I took part in IGEM. Over the past year, we have encountered a lot of difficulties, but never gave up. We actively communicated with other igem teams, carried out social practice and payed close attention to the new development of biological field,  I have not only learned a lot, but also made a lot of friends. More importantly, I am extremely pleased to be able to contribute to the world by my efforts.
Hi everyone,I’m one of the members frome team NUDT_CHINA ,Shan Huang .Since I’m a   junior student majoring in chemistry ,some specialized courses are related to biology ,which gives me a chance to learn the charm of bioscience .Out of our laboratory ,a lusty girl is my normal state .I’m risible and conversable ,I also have accomplishment in traditional instrument ,erhu ,which can cultivate my taste .I expect that I can play a positive role in my dear team.

I am Changsong Gao,21 years old, born in Henan province.I am currently a student at NUDT and major in biomedical engineering. In the past 1 years,I spend most of my time on lab. I have acquired basic knowledge of biology both in theory and in practice. My hobby is widespread,such as reading,listening to music, playing basketball. I always believe that one will easily lag behind unless he keeps on lab.I think my instructor will keep pushing me on experiment just like one of his dogs.
Hey，everybody！I am Ziyi Qiao. In NUDT_China team, I was a member of the HP group. Because of the favor of biology ,I joined this team,I am currently a jounior student in my university and major in Communication and Information Engineering. Thank iGEM for the platform they offer, which makes me get acquainted with the  knowledge of synbio and cytobiology and be familiar with many impressive young men. Keeping learning new things in these fields have given me great happiness. I love IGEM and I love my team.
I am Shi Haotian, a student from NUDT.Major in biology, I learn biology hard and look forward to improve my biology knowledge and experiment skill. I believe that biology technology will be of great importance in the future, so I want to contribute to the socity with what I learnt.Because I am interested in biology and want to develop practical ability, I took part in IGEM. In this year, I have spent time doing experiment as well as do some research on coasting. I think taking part in IGEM improve my biology knowledge as well as my ability to put my knowledge and practice together.

Hi, I’m Qijie Xu. Just like one year before, I hate sport as of old. Thanks to this, I am still fat like last year. It is the second year I take part in iGEM. I am really pleasure to be a part of NUDT_CHINA this team again.In this year, I mainly work in experiment. Although I had participated in iGEM last year, but it is the first year that I work for experiment group. By means of this year's experiment, I have learnt a lot. It also make me feel the happiness and agony of the lab-life.

In the home page I prefer the vivid demonstrating, however, in other parts I like the tidy and simple style for better reading.
Hello, i am Xiaoju Chang, a junior in physics. My main job in our team is to organize activities for HP, and i enjoy doing this. Meeting people and talk to them is a lucky thing!
My name is Zhang Herui, but calling me Candice is also acceptable. I'm a senior three student from the International Department in the First High School of Changsha. I am a passionate lover of biology; so I join NUDT_CHINA for iGEM as the only high school student in the team. During my high school years, I have been a member of the school Biology Olympiad training team, the first speaker in a debate team, a pianist on New Year party, and the liberto in a volleyball team. Usually, I'm amiable and caring, willing to help around. This is probably the core reason that I plan to take biomedical research or physician as my future career: in order to make tiny but worthwhile contributions in areas that intrigue me.
