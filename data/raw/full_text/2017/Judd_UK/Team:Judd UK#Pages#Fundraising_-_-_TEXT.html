Fundraising
To raise money for our project, we undertook a variety of fundraising activities. Firstly, we filmed a fundraising video that we posted and shared on a number of online platforms to spread the message of synthetic biology and iGEM whilst raising money for the team.

Three members of our student team, Alfie Scopes, Adam Fidler and Oli Prendergast as well as our PI, Mrs Andrews, ran the Tonbridge Half-Marathon with everyone completing it within 2 hours and 10 minutes! They all wore t-shirts that promoted our crowdfunding page for the run.
Finally, we held a 'Quiz Night for a cause' at our school in October. Over 100 students and parents attended and enjoy several rounds of a quiz that included a round of iGEM and synthetic biology inspired questions!  At the end of the night, we held a raffle where the prizes had been donated to the team from various shops around the area, including a Dyson vacuum cleaner. It was a exciting night for all as well as beneficial to our team's fundraising efforts.
