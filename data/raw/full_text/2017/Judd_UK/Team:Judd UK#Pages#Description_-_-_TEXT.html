Description
Over 2 billion people worldwide in both MEDCs and LEDCs are affected by anaemia; mainly infants and pregnant women. Iron deficiency symptoms include lethargy, heart conditions, pale skin, reduced cognitive ability and even death. Additionally, many countries give out iron tablets prophylactically to pregnant women and to children, whether they are anaemic or not (because anaemia is such an issue). Side effects of iron overdose are similarly harmful so to be able to home-test and know that iron supplements are not required would be extremely beneficial.
Our iGEM project is to create a home testing kit for detecting iron levels in saliva, which is strongly correlated with iron levels in the blood, to warn people with abnormal concentrations of this essential mineral. The kits will be in the form of slips of paper, which are cell-free systems. These include all the necessary cellular components in cell-free extracts and our genetic construct which are embedded into the paper and freeze-dried. They are easily stored and distributed at a stable room temperature and when necessary can be activated by rehydration. The current method for measuring iron is a full blood count which is expensive, time-consuming and often not available in less economically developed countries. Our test will be cheap and easy to use, making it a more efficient method of testing for iron.
In order to react to different iron levels, our construct will be promoted by the AceB gene, which can be regulated by FUR, a transcriptional repressor of genes involved in iron homeostasis. In the presence of Fe2+ ions, this protein dimerises which allows linkage to a FUR binding site to inhibit mRNA transcription of the downstream gene. To ensure an increase in iron leads to an increase in transcription we will use an inverter, which involves placing a LacI coding region downstream of the FUR regulated promoter. A second plasmid has a promoter that in the presence of LacI inhibits transcription of the chromoprotein coding region downstream. Therefore, in the presence of no iron the iron sensitive promoter allows LacI to be produced, which inhibits transcription of the amilCP chromoprotein on the second plasmid. However, in the presence of iron the iron sensitive promoter is inhibited so LacI is not produced and amilCP can be transcribed to produce a vibrant blue colour in response to iron. Different levels of iron will result in different levels of transcription of the chromoprotein so our device will be semi-quantitative. </br> <a href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Judd_UK/Achievements ">Jamboree Achievements</a>
