Firstly, we filmed a fundraising video that we posted and shared on a number of online platforms to spread the message of synthetic biology and iGEM whilst raising money for the team.</P><P>&lt;video id=&quot;my-video&quot; class=&quot;video-js&quot; controls preload=&quot;auto&quot; width=&quot;480px&quot; data-setup=&quot;{}&quot;&gt;</P><PRE>&lt;source src=&quot;<A rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/2/2c/Judd_UK_FundVid_Lowres.mp4">https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/2/2c/Judd_UK_FundVid_Lowres.mp4</A>&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;</PRE><P class="vjs-no-js">

They all wore t-shirts that promoted our crowdfunding page for the run.</P><P>Finally, we held a 'Quiz Night for a cause' at our school in October. Over 100 students and parents attended and enjoy several rounds of a quiz that included a round of iGEM and synthetic biology inspired questions! 
At the end of the night, we held a raffle where the prizes had been donated to the team from various shops around the area, including a Dyson vacuum cleaner. It was a exciting night for all as well as beneficial to our team's fundraising efforts.</P><P>&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;47%&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;right&quot; width=&quot;47%&quot;&gt;</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
