We decided to use the DH5-alpha strain of Escherichia coli as our chassis as that is from Risk Group 1, and all our parts are non-toxic to life. Our LacI protein is already commonly found in bacteria in small concentrations and our amilCP chromoprotein has little to no effect on the bacteria themselves, plants or humans. We also had very small concentrations of amilCP throughout our experiments and, in some cases, it was only produced in the presence of iron. We always worked in a BioSafety Level 1 laboratory at an open bench. 		</P><H2 id="Aseptic-technique-1"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Aseptic_technique">Aseptic technique</SPAN></H2><P>When working with live bacteria, it is important to have a Bunsen burner nearby on a strong flame to prevent contamination. This is because the Bunsen burner creates a convection current in the surrounding area which prevents any external bacteria from invading the workplace from above. We sterilised the work bench prior and after all experiments we did. Furthermore, we used our own autoclaving machine to sterilise all of our equipment so there was little waiting time as everything could be prepared the day before important experiments. 		</P><H2 id="Working-in-the-School-Lab-2"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Working_in_the_School_Lab">Working in the School Lab</SPAN></H2><P>As a state school, we do not have access to many labs and all the labs are also used for teaching purposes. Consequently, as a team, we had to find ways to combat this issue whilst prioritising safety in our work. 		</P><H3 id="Licensing-3"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Licensing">Licensing</SPAN></H3><P>Due to some strict laws and regulations surrounding genetic modification work in the UK, schools and institutions need a special clearance from the Health &amp; Safety Executive to work with genetically modified bacteria. Also, this issue was brought to light in the early days of our project, we thought that since we planned on using a cell free system, we would not be working with GM bacteria and so did not need to apply for such a license. However, we soon realised that we needed to work with an in vivo system, but we didn't have a clearance to do so. Normally, universities already have this clearance because it is in their specification to work with GM bacteria. The complete process of applying and paying for this clearance took a very long time, primarily because it was the summer season and so many people were on holiday. This stalled our lab work for a few weeks, but we did manage to overcome this hurdle and have succeeded with our practicals! 			</P><P>For more information on this clearance in the UK, visit: <A rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l29.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l29.htm</A></P><H3 id="Using-the-Laboratory-4"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Using_the_Laboratory">Using the Laboratory</SPAN></H3><P>Since we did not have our own designated lab and so had to occasionally store antibiotic and our bacteria on an agar plate in the lab fridge, we had to ensure that any students in the lab at the time were well informed about this so that no accidents should occur regardless of whether they were doing experiments or not.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
