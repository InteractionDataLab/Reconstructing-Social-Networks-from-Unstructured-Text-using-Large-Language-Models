Achievements
As the Judd iGEM team, we achieved a lot in Boston. We not only achieved a Silver medal in the competition, but also won the awards for best Public Engagement and Education and for best Model in the High School stream. Also, more importantly, we went to the Cheesecake Factory. Twice.
Jokes aside, we had a great time in Boston and brought the project we created to an international audience. We presented at the conference not only verbally but also in three one-hour poster sessions. Along the way we must have told hundreds of people, from many different continents, about IonIron.
We were privileged to represent our school in a field that we feel passionately about, and hope that our work will inspire the future generation of state school iGEM teams.
As this was Judd's first entry into iGEM, we were incredibly proud and surprised to find out that we had been awarded not one, but two prizes for the best project elements. Our team was awarded "Best Model" and "Best Education and Public Engagement" and nominated for best wiki.
Overall, our team won a silver medal at the iGEM 2017 Jamboree.
