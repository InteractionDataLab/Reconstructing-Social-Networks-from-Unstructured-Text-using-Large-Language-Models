Introducing the Iron Home Testing Kit
About Our School
The Judd School is a state school situated in the south east of England in West Kent. It has over 1,000 students with around 250 in the senior school. Itâ€™s from the senior school or sixth form that the team of 15 pupils was selected. This year is the first year Judd have ever entered a team into the IGEM competition. In addition to this, we are the first state school from Britain to complete what is required for the competition and one of only two British high schools to enter in 2017. As much as this is daunting, the team and two supporting staff, were extremely excited by the opportunities that IGEM provides and have gained valuable experience from participating.
Our Goal
The goal of our iGEM project is to create a home testing kit for detecting iron levels, to warn people with abnormal concentrations of this essential mineral. Over 2 billion people worldwide in both MEDCs and LEDCs are affected by anaemia; mainly infants and pregnant women. Iron deficiency symptoms include lethargy, heart conditions, pale skill and even reduced cognitive ability, so an easy way to test whether one has abnormal amounts of it would be greatly beneficial.
