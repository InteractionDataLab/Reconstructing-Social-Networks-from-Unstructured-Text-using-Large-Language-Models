Human Practices:
-We held a club called Bioblast to teach year 7s about synthetic biology. We also held a school assembly about iGem, detailing our work as a team and the purpose of iGem.
-Furthermore, we presented at two science conferences; one by Young Scientist’s Journal in Cambridge, and one local one, held by Tonbridge School, each of these detailing our project and the problems presented by iron deficiency and overdose. Click <a href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Judd_UK/HP/Silver ">here</a> to find out more about our human practices.
-Finally, some of the team presented at our school Biology Society, and the sporty ones among us ran the Tonbridge Half-Marathon to raise awareness of Synthetic Biology.
Gold
Integrated Human Practices:
- We gave a presentation at the school’s Medical Society detailing the problems surrounding iron deficiency and anaemia issues.
-We held an interview with a consultant haematologist at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in which we talked about the implications of our project, including the effects on healthcare in third-world countries and the health market worldwide.

Modelling
- Modelled our system using hill equations and used the model to find the best value for initial FUR concentration. Click <a href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Judd_UK/Model ">here</a> for more.
-Improve an existing part – we characterised and improved a part from Evry 2013, which used RFP as their end reporter, whereas we are using amilCP, a blue chromoprotein. This means that the colour change, or lack thereof, can be seen regardless of light conditions.
