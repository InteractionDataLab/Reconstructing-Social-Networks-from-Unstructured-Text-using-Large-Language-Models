The outline of their project was to design a capsule that releases an iron biosensor which would produce an iron chelator to reduce iron levels in the small intestine. Our construct was inspired by BBa_K1163102, BBa_K1163103 and BBa_J04450. We modified the protein that is control to amilCP thereby creating a new construct &amp; introducing further variability to characterised biobricks.</P><P>FeSO4 was used as the reactant as documented in the Evry team's notebook. We also use 50uL of FeSO4 but noticed that our bacteria stopped growing under 10mM concentrations. We therefore modified the concentration too.</P><H2 id="Kent-2017-iGEM-Team-1"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Kent_2017_iGEM_Team">Kent 2017 iGEM Team</SPAN></H2><P>The Kent 2017 iGEM Teams provided us with a space to work in and all the equipment necessary to complete the interlab studies.</P><P>Since we do not have plate readers we couldn't complete the interlab studies alone. The Kent team kindly completed the two days of preparation and growing the cultures for us. 2 members of our team, Mateo Hoare &amp; Nikita Shukan, also helped to prepare the fluorescein stock and dilution for the standard curve. [3 members of kent iGEM team] assisted our 2 team members in taking the readers using a plate reader. They helped us with our interlab using Kit Plate 6.</P><H2 id="CLSB-2017-iGEM-Team-2"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="CLSB_2017_iGEM_Team">CLSB 2017 iGEM Team</SPAN></H2><P>	Adam Jones and George Smith of the City of London School for Boys iGEM team gave an avid introduction to mathematical modelling, as well as advice along the way.</P><H2 id="Oxford-2017-iGEM-Team-3"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Oxford_2017_iGEM_Team">Oxford 2017 iGEM Team</SPAN></H2><P>Chun Ngai Au of the Oxford iGEM team directed the modelling team to the most appropriate model for our project and provided an explanation for the concepts, along with links and papers for further reading.</P><H2 id="Mrs-Prendergast-4"><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mrs._Prendergast">Mrs. Prendergast</SPAN></H2><P>Mrs Prendergast, Oli Prendergast's mother, has vast experience in fundraising and marketing.

This included: providing a freezer to store our competent cells at -80Â°C (equipment we did not have), transporting the cells to our lab and donating many of the reagents and other equipment such as tips, LB and antibiotics. Also the minipreps and gel electrophoresis was carried out in his lab due to our lack of equipment.
