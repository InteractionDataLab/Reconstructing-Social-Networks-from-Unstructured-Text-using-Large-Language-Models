Notebook
This notebook documents the lab work undertaken by team members of Judd UK, which occurred from September to October 2017.                  Prior to this lab work, the team spent all of April, May and June researching potential ideas for our project. We spent all of May investigating the production of Vitamin D3, before deciding that there were too many biological complications to undertake the project. We settled on iron testing in June, and then spent the following months fundraising before beginning lab work in September                  It does not record the details of the work carried out at the University of Kent, where we collaborated in September to transform some cells and to complete our interlab study. The bold type denotes the date of the work, and the present team member’s initials. All work was supervised by either Mrs. Andrews (HMA) or Dr. Courel (MFC)

Pelleting of test tubes:
We pelleted 5 of the tubes at 8am, 11am, 2pm, 5pm and 8pm. 
Each tube took four cycles of centrifuging for 3 minutes and removing the supernatant, because they now contained 6ml and the Eppendorfs only hold 1.5ml. 
We took pictures of the pellets formed, but unfortunately none of them had developed a blue colour. 
This means that the experiment was inconclusive as to whether our detector is working. 
We also ran three control test tubes, each with only plasmid 2 bacteria and with no iron, which were pelleted at 8am, 2pm and 8pm. 
These all showed strong blue colours, which is what we expected from plasmid 2 in all cases.

Mrs Andrews removed the pellets from yesterday from the Eppendorf tubes with cotton buds and placed them in a grid for easy viewing., (see picture)

This marks the end of our iGEM lab work, as we have run out of time. We would like to be able to run more tests with different setups, but as the wiki freeze is today, we would be unable to share our results. As such, the project ends here. Thank you for reading.
