To achieve the thought of blue-light-controlled self-lysis E.coli cells, we separated the whole system into two parts: the light-controlled system and the functional gene. The YF1-Fix blue light sensitive system had been chosen as our light-controlled system, and lysin is good as the functional gene. The way they work together has been shown in the short video.
These two parts were synthesized and tested separately. The light-controlled system was followed by eGFP as a reporter so that we could test its efficiency by testing the fluorescence intensity. As for the lytic effect of lysin, we used the colony counting method after dilution spreading.
