Silver Medal Criterion #2
Shanghai Jiao Tong University
SJU is experienced in iGEM competition, to better improve our project, we paid a visit to Shanghai Jiaotong University on 14th April 2017. On arrival, teacher Wang and students there greeted us warmly, and spared no effort to share us with their years’ experience, including the problem we might meet in visa, accommodation and tickets booking and they also advised us how to establish a spirit to unite teammates together. Then we presented our projects in turn and teacher Wang provided several valuable advice.
SJU also offered their help to our experiment by providing pBR322-dusk-mRFP2 and pBAD18-pFixK2 to us.
We would like to express our sincere appreciation to SJU’s constructive suggestions and plasmid, they did help us a lot.
Shenzhen University
Though it’s the first year that we’ve participated in iGEM, we tried to help other teams. We set a good relationship with Shenzhen University. We provided them with plasmid pP43NMK-PGA when they turned to us for help.
Our project didn’t go without difficulty, actually we failed several times in establishing the light-involved system. Knowing that, Huazhong Agricultural University has successfully transformed a related plasmid, we contacted with them immediately, fortunately they were warm-hearted, and send the plasmid to us without hesitation.
