ZJUT-China
IGEM
TEAM
ZJUT-CHINA was founded in December 2016 will be held in November this year on behalf of workers went to the United States in Boston iGEM final we use specific gene recombinant plasmid and its photosensitive protein into Escherichia coli gene expression in a given life special characteristic of Escherichia coli, which can cleavage at a specific wavelength of light irradiation to release the metabolites we need the.

★Xin Lu
Hi,my name is Xin Lu ,I am a student leader of ZJUT-CHINA team.Before joined in the IGEM,I do not konw the competition,and as I know the IGEM ,I think it is interesting.Because our university participated in the competition for the firs time,we have not experience enough, it is a big challenge for us.So we communicated with other IGEMer actively , and work hard,we are enjoying on it. In this group, I learned plenty of biological knowledge and improved some experiment skills,I am glad to join in it,and it is an unforgettable experience.
☆Geyi Wang
One of the students leader of ZJUT-China and our laboratory  subgroup. The one who came up with the idea of light-controlled self-lysis of E.coli cells. I have participated in the vast majority of experimental and wiki works. But HP work is the part which interests me most. I did gain something special from iGEM this time, something thought-provoking.  Always fix my eyes forward on what still can be changed.
Liyang Yu
Hi! I’m Liyang Yu. As an undergraduate student in Zhejiang University of Technology, majoring in Bioengineering. Being interested in synthetic biology, I enjoyed concentrating on doing experiment with my partners. In our team, I am responsible for building standard parts with another girl. Being in this competition is an unforgettable and significant experience in my college life.
Xiaojun Zheng
In charge of human practice, I carried out most of the communication and propaganda work, and wrote record essays to sum up the experience or for advertise. With reliable and enthusiastic personality, I am willing to fight to the last second to perfect the project.
Yisha Zhu
Hello. My name is Yisha Zhu, you can also call me Summery. I am 22 years old. I will graduate from Zhejiang University of Technology with my bachelor degree in the next year. My major is bioengineering. The iGEM is a organized, challenging competition for students in Synthetic Biology, therefore I came. This summer , I spend a lot of time to finish our project with the other partners. In iGEM-ZJUT, I work on the wet group. After several setbacks, we finally got the desired results. Now, I'm starting to look forward to our performance at the Giant Jamboree.
Jiahui Liu
Hello！I'm Jiahui Liu，21 years olds.I'm very glad to be here to introduce myself. My hometown is QuZhou，ZheJiang.Now I'm a junior in zhejiang university of techonology and major in biological engineering.     Actually I'm a quiet girl and always do some reading or see some movies on leisure time. Maybe we can share with each other.
Wei Zhang
I'm Wei Zhang from Zhe Jiang University of Technology.I'm a part of wet team which construct and modify the light-switchable system.To be honest,it is more difficult than I had thought to make the system works sensitively. Fortunately,through our parters hard-working,we finally make it!
Yuehao Gu
Hello, my name is Yuehao Gu. I’m an undergraduate student in Zhejiang University of Technology and my major is Bioengineering.It’s my pleasure to have a chance to participate in iGEM competition. Being curious about synthetic biology, I enjoyed the process enormously during discussing our research with my team member and also learned a lot form this research . In our team, I am responsible for human practice with several partners.It was an unforgettable experience in my life！
