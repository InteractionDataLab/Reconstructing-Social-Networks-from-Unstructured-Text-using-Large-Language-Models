International Genetically
Engineered Machine Competition
International Genetic Engineering Machine Competition (iGEM), known as the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition, founded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2003, developed into an international academic competition in 2005 and a top international academic competition in the field of synthetic biology. iGEM involves multidisciplinary, multidisciplinary, multidisciplinary iGEM teams that need to use standard biometric modules to build genetic loops and establish effective mathematical models to predict, manipulate, and measure sophisticated artificial artificial systems. Complete the game.

ZJUT - CHINA
We live with creativity
ZJUT - CHINA was founded in December 2016, will be held in November this year, went to the United States to participate in the Boston iGEM final.
We use a specific gene to construct a recombinant plasmid and transfer it to E. coli. The gene expresses the light-sensitive protein to give the specific life characteristics of Escherichia coli so that it can be cleaved at a specific wavelength of light, thereby releasing what we need metabolite.
