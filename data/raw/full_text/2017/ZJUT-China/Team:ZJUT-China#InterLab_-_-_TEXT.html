This year we took part in the InterLab Study.
Following the Protocols, we had tested the OD600 Reference point and fluorescein fluorescence standard curve before cell measurement. All information about the instrument had been recorded and the path length correction was turned off. The figure shows the series of standard curves we got. We chose the curve whose sensitivity volume is 6 for cells measurement.
Here shows the final result of our InterLab Study.
