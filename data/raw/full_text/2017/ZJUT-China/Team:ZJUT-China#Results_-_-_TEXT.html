Experiments
The functional gene lysin (BBa_K2277000) was tested using OD600 testing&dilution-spread method and works well.
The functional gene bcsB (BBa_K2277110) has been tested and being abandoned.
The reporter gene eGFP (BBa_K2277033) works well as reporter gene.
The new FixK2 promoter (BBa_K2277233) has improved the efficiency of the existing part BBa_K1065303.
The light-controlled part (BBa_K2277555) has been tested using eGFP as the reporter gene and works well.
The whole light-controlled lysis system (BBa_K2277666) is constructed successfully and was tested using OD600 testing.
The whole system’s constitution is shown in the picture.
Cells will self-lyse in the absence of blue light.
Device
Light Source
Light Intensity
When we were making the circuit boards using as the light source, function had a priority.According to the requirements of our cells culture, which is, a fixed wavelength of the blue light irradiation which could start our lysin gene.Therefore, in the process of experimental variables involved, we controlled the wavelength and strength of light source. Then we built bottom fixed wavelength light source in the completely dark black case. In order to control conveniently, we designed a multi paralleled DC circuit which was simple, stable and switchable. Battery powered LED lamps were chosen as the light source so that the device would be easy to carry out.

Light (circuit board) is fixed at the bottom, and the switch is fixed outside.When being used, the test tube should be placed from the top into the device, then cap the tube in order to make sure it’s completely opaque.
Modeling
Based on our experiments data and minimized stimulation device, we created a fermenter model of our light-induced self-lysis system. Our model informed the possible positions for company to input the light source. And it also provide cost budget in fermentation process for reference. This model, presenting below, consists of the ideal figure of fermenter and calculating process of the cost budget.
More details are in the Modeling Part.
