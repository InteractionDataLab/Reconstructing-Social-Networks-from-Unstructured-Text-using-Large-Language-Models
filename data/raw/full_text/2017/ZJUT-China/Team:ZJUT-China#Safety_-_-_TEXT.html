Safety
As a gesture to security, our team chose Escherichia coli as our object of the project. Lab coats, gloves and masks are enough for our project. The only problem we needs to pay attention to is that the gloves used in Gel Electrophoresis Room cannot be taken out because of the toxicity of nucleic acid dyes and TAE solution.
