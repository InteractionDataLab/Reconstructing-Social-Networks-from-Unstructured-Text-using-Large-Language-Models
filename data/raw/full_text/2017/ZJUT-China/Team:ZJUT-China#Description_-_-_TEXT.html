Conception
Nowadays intracellular products take up a great share o the market, and with the increase of people’s need, they will create a growing market value. But the way to extra the target products from inside of the cells has always been a problem. Chemical disruption ways will mix in new impurities which need to be separated later, and physical ways may bring high temperature leading to unstable products so they need chillers. Considering of  this problem, we came up with an idea that if cells could self-lyse under the  control of some convenient conditions provided by environment, for example, the light, because light serves as an excellent trigger to achieve precise control on synthetic systems as it can regulate in wavelength, timing, intensity and location. Based on this thought, the project showed in the video just came out. In particular, we focused on Escherichia coli in the project because it’s common used and easy to operate. The project may fit other bacteria in further study.
