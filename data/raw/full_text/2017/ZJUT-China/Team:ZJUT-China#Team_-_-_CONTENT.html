ZJUT-CHINA was founded in December 2016 will be held in November this year on behalf of workers went to the United States in Boston iGEM final we use specific gene recombinant plasmid and its photosensitive protein into Escherichia coli gene expression in a given life special characteristic of Escherichia coli, which can cleavage at a specific wavelength of light irradiation to release the metabolites we need the.

In this group, I learned plenty of biological knowledge and improved some experiment skills,I am glad to join in it,and it is an unforgettable experience.</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4>☆Geyi Wang</H4><P>One of the students leader of ZJUT-China and our laboratory  subgroup. The one who came up with the idea of light-controlled self-lysis of E.coli cells. I have participated in the vast majority of experimental and wiki works. But HP work is the part which interests me most. I did gain something special from iGEM this time, something thought-provoking. 
Always fix my eyes forward on what still can be changed.</P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H4>Liyang Yu</H4><P>Hi! I’m Liyang Yu. As an undergraduate student in Zhejiang University of Technology, majoring in Bioengineering. Being interested in synthetic biology, I enjoyed concentrating on doing experiment with my partners.

My name is Yisha Zhu, you can also call me Summery. I am 22 years old. I will graduate from Zhejiang University of Technology with my bachelor degree in the next year. My major is bioengineering. The iGEM is a organized, challenging competition for students in Synthetic Biology, therefore I came. This summer , I spend a lot of time to finish our project with the other partners. In iGEM-ZJUT, I work on the wet group. After several setbacks, we finally got the desired results. Now, I'm starting to look forward to our performance at the Giant Jamboree. </P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H4>Jiahui Liu</H4><P> Hello！I'm Jiahui Liu，21 years olds.I'm very glad to be here to introduce myself. My hometown is QuZhou，ZheJiang.Now I'm a junior in zhejiang university of techonology and major in biological engineering.
    Actually I'm a quiet girl and always do some reading or see some movies on leisure time. Maybe we can share with
each other. </P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H4>Wei Zhang</H4><P>I'm Wei Zhang from Zhe Jiang University of Technology.I'm a part of wet team which construct and modify the light-switchable system.To be honest,it is more difficult than I had thought to make the system works sensitively.
