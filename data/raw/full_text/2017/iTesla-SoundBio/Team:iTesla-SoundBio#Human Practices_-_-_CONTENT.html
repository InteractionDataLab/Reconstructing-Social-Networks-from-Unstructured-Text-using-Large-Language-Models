Our team fundraised on the <A href="https://fundly.com/help-launch-the-1st-high-school-igem-research-team-in-wa-team-itesla">Fundly page</A> and <A href="https://experiment.com/users/titeslasoundbio">Experiment.com</A> pages, raising over $3,700 in total. We also gave away souvenirs such as key chains as a friendly thank you to our donors of their impactful and generous contributions. During the process, we wanted to reach a wider audience, so we made a poster with a QR code to our (see figure below.</DIV><DIV><H1>Meeting a Young Scientist</H1><P>One of our group members, Joshua Argote-Medrano, used his trip to Bolivia as an opportunity to get young people interested in synthetic biology. Joshua gave several talks about our team, SoundBio Lab's role as a DIY biohacker space, and the intricacies of the iGEM competition. These talks were given at <I>Centro Boliviano Americano</I> (CBA), a national English-learning school in Bolivia, His presentations were both in English and Spanish, allowing to a reach a wide audience. He also spoke to secondary school children from <I>El Colegio Secundario San Agustin</I> in central city Cochabamba, Bolivia, about  multiple STEM fields to promote team-working skills and raise awareness about a rapidly expanding field. He worked closely with Dr. Gonzalo Argote Garcia, Ph.D, to organize the event. </P></DIV><DIV><H1>Community</H1>
In addition to serving international communities, iTesla-SoundBio also served its local community (Redmond, WA). At the Redmond City Library, we held an event highlighting our project and iGEM as a whole through interactive activities such as DNA extractions, pipetting practice, and learning about biohazard safety awareness  .</DIV><DIV><H1>Videos</H1><P>iTesla-SoundBio has a YouTube channel and an affiliated channel called The Genetics Lab.
