Description
This year we want to develop a pathogen-specific antibiotic to circumvent the possible establishment of resistance and side-effects during therapy.  We develop a novel sidechain for Clorobiocin via chemical synthesis and a newly designed enzyme expressed in Streptomyces.  This antibiotic will be used in toxicity assays in E. coli with novobiocin resistent gyrases, which could later be used in the treatment of MRSA.
