Collaborations
YouTube
Our team evolved the idea to create a YouTube channel. The purpose was to create and manage a YouTube platform on which collaborating teams could post different kinds of short videos such as lab tutorials and link them to their unique iGEM project. The videos promote the main idea and diversity of iGEM. We are very proud to announce that our collaboration partners come from 4 different continents and speak 6 different languages.
The YouTube channel is intended to reach out to everybody who is not yet aware of iGEM and its possibilities and will consequently encourage and inspire future iGEM teams. It works as a network and multiplies the range of iGEM teams’ social media presence.     You can find all videos here here .

Post Cards
The iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf started a campaign to promote synthetic biology in public by using self-designed postcards. The postcards are created individually by each team to illustrate their project briefly. A batch of each team’s postcard is exchanged so that every team can share postcards from all over the world.
The postcards are used to promote iGEM and the idea of international networking by handing them out at public events. Thus each individual postcard arrived somewhere else around the globe as a symbol of the international and public dimension of iGEM.
Laboratory collaboration: Efficacy spectrum
We want to thank iGEM Team Franconia for testing our produced antibiotic clorobiocin on C. glutamicum.  Their tests with our established protocol for agar diffusion assay and different antibiotic concentrations show that clorobiocin works as potent as Ampicillin on C.glutamicum strain 13032. These data provide information on inhibition of corynebacterium growth by aminocoumarins. They saw that  C.glutamicun strain 13032 is more sensitive to clorobiocin than our tested ΔTolC E.coli and the MIC is lower than 2.5 µg clorobiocin (s.c. 1 mg/ml). This is consistent with the fact that aminocoumarins work most efficient in gram-positive bacteria like Streptococci or Acinetobacter. These results provide additional information on the efficacy spectrum of aminocoumarins enlarging the range to Corynebacteria. Thank you Franconia for this fruitful collaboration.
