The product was stored in methanol at room temperature during this time, which might have reduced yield significantly.
 </LI><LI>Preparation for work in molecular biology lab (competent cells, media, agar-plates). Begin of cloning β-lactam-synthetases wild type (WT) and double mutant (DM) into pUWL. 

 </LI></UL><H2 id="August 2017" class="anchor">August 2017</H2><UL><LI>No success in purification of 3-(((1-carboxypropan-2-yl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. 
</LI><LI>Begin of cloning NovL, SimL, CouL and CloL into pUWL and pSB1C3. 
</LI><LI>The cloning of GyrB (<I>S.aureus</I>) plus Terminator BamHI/HindIII in pSB1C3 was started and finished successfully. Furthermore the GyrB (<I>E.coli</I>) was cloned into pSB4C5 under control of a arac-pBad promoter. 
</LI><LI>Additionally the Interlabstudy was carried out. </LI><LI>The work with <I>S. coelicolor</I> was started. Collection of spores from <I>S. coelicolor</I> M1146/Clo BG1 and Clo SA02 and inoculation of <I>S. coelicolor</I> M1146 / Clo BG1 for Clorobiocin production.</LI></UL><H2 id="September 2017" class="anchor">September 2017</H2><UL><LI>Extraction of Clorobiocin from <I>S. coelicolor</I> M1146 / Clo BG1.

</LI><LI>First feeding experiments of <I>S. coelicolor</I> M1156/Clo BG1, with unpurified 3-(((1-carboxypropan-2-yl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxybenzoic acid was started.

</LI><LI>Cloning of pRha (BBa_K914003) and RBS (BBa_B0034) into pSB1C3.
</LI><LI>Cloning of GyrB (<I>E.coli</I>) under control of an arac-pBad promoter into pSB1C3-pRha-RBS.
</LI><LI>Reordering of SHV and GyrA (<I>S. coelicolor</I>) gBlocks and cloning into pSB1C3. SHV cloning into pSB1C3 and pSB1C3-pRha-RBS worked immediately. 
</LI><LI>Cloning of BLS DM in pSB1C3 and BLS WT in pSB1C3-pRha-RBS. 
</LI><LI>Cloning of CloL and CouL into pSB1C3.
</LI><LI>Since cloning of BLS DM in pSB1C3 pRha-RBS did not work, it was cloned into pRha-RBS-pSB1K3 for test expression.  
</LI><LI>Agar diffusion test with different concentrations of Clorobiocin with XL-1 blue and TolC <I>E.coli</I> were done. Clorobiocin and wafers were sent to iGEM team Franconia for our collaboration.
</LI><LI>Test expression and purification of BLS WT and DM.
</LI><LI>First try to close the ring of our chemical synthesis <I>in vitro</I>.
