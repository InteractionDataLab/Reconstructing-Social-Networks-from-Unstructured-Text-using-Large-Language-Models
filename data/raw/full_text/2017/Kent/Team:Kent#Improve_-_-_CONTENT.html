variety of purposes. Our main objectives range from ‘near’ future, to ‘future’.</LABEL></HEADER><SECTION class="hull"><LABEL class="hull-title" for="cb1">Near Future</LABEL><DIV class="hull-content">Although the processes within the central dogma have been studied and thoroughly characterized,
recent studies suggest mRNA localization is a way of controlling and regulating protein production. ¹ This
mechanism appears to be similar to an induced suppressor that binds to DNA, thereby preventing its
transcription, except there are significantly more (regulating) factors involved. Unfortunately, our
knowledge is very limited as mRNA’s dynamic nature makes it significantly more difficult to study.
As our protein, LuCAS, has the ability to attach to, and track any RNA, given it has its complementary
crRNA sequence, the main objective is to track and investigate mRNA localization. LuCAS is sensitive and
selective to singular basepairs, making it a reliable tracking tool without altering the cell and its
intracellular function itself.

When making the LB we also made another litre batch and added 15g of agar extract to be able to
grow bacteria on plates.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="hull"><LABEL class="hull-title" for="cb2">Future</LABEL><DIV class="hull-content">In a variety of disease states, mRNA could be used as a ‘biomarker’ and therapeutic target. Oncogenes
for example, such as Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are often overexpressed early in cancers
and treatment courses based on the type of mutations causing the cancer have been shown to be
crucial to treatment success; in this case for example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal
antibodies. Tools like LuCAS could potentially quantify and elucidate hyperproliferation and even qualify
mRNA as therapeutic target to halt hyper proliferation of key ‘driver’ genes by targeting their mRNA.
Furthermore, monitoring mRNA expression in patients suffering chronic viral infections, such as HIV or
hepatitis B, can help pinpoint disease progression and aid in treatment path selection, as disease
progression varies individually. HIV genes can be classified in early and late expression, with their
detection of corresponding mRNA, via LuCAS, helping to narrow down the stage of disease.
The possible applications of LuCAS are many, as we simply propose a reliable and selective way to target
mRNA in vivo without altering cellular functions; be it for research, diagnostics or therapeutics.
~ LuCas is still a toddler and these are his first baby steps, we can’t wait to see him prosper and grow
into a young man that will change the world for the better</DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="hull"><LABEL class="hull-title" for="cb3">References</LABEL><DIV class="hull-content">Kejiou, N. S. and Palazzo, A. F. (2017), mRNA localization as a rheostat to regulate subcellular gene
