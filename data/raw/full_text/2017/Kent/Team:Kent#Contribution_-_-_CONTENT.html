He worked out the equations and created 3D pymol images of our system, and also helped out with the dry lab side of the project by helping at the bO!ng International Family Festival at the Gulbenkian, University of Kent. </DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="hull"><LABEL class="hull-title" for="cb3">Laulwa Al Salloum</LABEL><DIV class="hull-content">Laulwa, as part of the wet lab team, performed most experiments from transformations, competent cell production, microscope imagery, PCR and transfections. She did research for the project design and was one of the team members focussed on the interlab study. Lulu was also responsible for the Facebook page and kept an eye on the expenditures. She also helped at the bO!ng international family festival and was a key asset in regards to our collaboration, helping the Judd High School team complete their interlab study. She worked as a student ambassador during the two open days, in which she helped explain our project to potential university students.
