Tarek Asfour
Tarek contributed strongly in the development of our brand designs. He coded the website, designed and perfected the poster and has developed and was responsible for the Team Kent branded clothes. He also did about all the visual artifacts that can be found on our website and poster and the boing! fair. Tarek was crucial to the development of the wiki and designing all the graphics by hand that were used in public events, the wiki and the poster.
Abdul Chowdhury
Abdul developed and worked out all the mathematical modelling of our project. He worked out the equations and created 3D pymol images of our system, and also helped out with the dry lab side of the project by helping at the bO!ng International Family Festival at the Gulbenkian, University of Kent.
Laulwa Al Salloum
Laulwa, as part of the wet lab team, performed most experiments from transformations, competent cell production, microscope imagery, PCR and transfections. She did research for the project design and was one of the team members focussed on the interlab study. Lulu was also responsible for the Facebook page and kept an eye on the expenditures. She also helped at the bO!ng international family festival and was a key asset in regards to our collaboration, helping the Judd High School team complete their interlab study. She worked as a student ambassador during the two open days, in which she helped explain our project to potential university students.
Nina Grexova
Nina was part of the wet lab and research team and took part in most labwork. Her main contribution lies in PCR and ligation of gBLOCKS, cloning and the transgene design as well as the research when the project idea was developed. Apart from that Nina was responsible for the Instagram channel and worked out ideas for our presence at the bO!ng International Family Festival at the Gulbenkian, University of Kent. She worked as a student ambassador during an open day at the university, helping explain iGEM and our project to potential university students.
Ivy Cheung
Ivy was part of the dry lab team and took part in organisation of key public engagement events, such as the bO!ng International Family Festival at the Gulbenkian in the University of Kent. She also contributed to the poster design for the UK team meetup in August, at the University of Westminster.
Harman Sanghera
Harman was part of the dry lab team and was solely responsible for development of several flash game that will improve the function of our project to children and young adults. He also took part in several human practices events such as questionnaires at the fresher’s fayre, and helped design the team shirts. He also lended a hand in the wet lab when one or more team members were not present.
Dan Brunkow
Dan was part of the wet lab team, and was involved in most lab work. He contributed to most experiments such as transformations of cells, creation of competent cells, mammalian cell transfection, microscope imagery, and assisted with PCR reactions. He also aided in the interlab study and was also involved in the bO!ng Festival for the human practices side of the project, and ran the Twitter account. Dan was also responsible for contacting some sponsors, along with presenting at the summer student symposium at the University of Kent, explaining our project to 2nd year students at the university and working at the open days, talking to future university students about iGem and our project. He is one of the presenters in Boston.
Laurens Heling
Laurens was part of both the wet lab and the dry lab team, but had roles extending throughout the project. He took part in most experiments, from molecular biology techniques such as minipreps, transformations and digests to mammalian cell culture and microscopy and was also heavily involved in the interlab study. He was also a key asset to the team in terms of research for the project idea, primer and g-block design and PCR reactions. Laurens also aided in the dry lab side of the project through creation of a series of Vlogs that were uploaded onto the team’s youtube channel, as well as creation of questionnaires for the public engagement area. He also presented at the summer student symposium at the University of Kent, and worked at the open days, explaining to potential students about our project and iGem as a whole. He is one of the presenters in Boston.
