Assumptions
dCAS13-a enzyme is modelled as a sphere
The mRNA in the cytoplasm is stationary.
The dCas enzyme faces no other competition from other organelles or objects inside the cell.
All conditions in the cell is kept constant.
When the dead dCas13 binds to a mRNA molecule it stays bound to it.
Size of fibroblast is the actual size minus the nucleus.
