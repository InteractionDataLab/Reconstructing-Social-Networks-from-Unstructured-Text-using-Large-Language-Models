Technical services provided us with equipment and materials for use during our time in the lab for the duration of the project, and autoclaved our biological waste. They provided everything from petri dishes to ingredients to make things like gels and agar, and glassware that was essential to our lab work. Julian Cook, head of technical services, also gave us a safety induction before our lab work began.</TECHNICAL></LI><LI>Taylor Monaghan
Taylor is a PhD student at the University of Kent who aided us in learning basic molecular biology techniques, acting as our lab supervisor. He guided us on safety in the lab,= and used his experience in the lab to provide a vital assistance to our team.</LI><LI>Dr Rosalyn Masterton
    Dr Masterton kindly helped us with gaining understanding in molecular biology and cloning as well as offering us a sample of pcDNA 3.1 (+) mammalian vector for cloning our construct for imaging.</LI><LI>Dr Emma Mead
Dr Emma Mead assisted us with all the mammalian cell culturing procedures. She kindly offered us a sample of HEK293 cells and aided us in experiment design, passaging and transfection. She also advised us on future design tweaks and experiments     </LI><LI>Dr Alexandra Moores
Dr Alexandra Moores was our point of contact in Dr Neil Kadâ€™s lab for most procedures. She also advised us in the optimization of experiments and protocols to achieve better results</LI><LI>
Professor Mark Smales
    Professor Mark Smales offered lab space for mammalian cell culturing and the chemicals necessary for these experiments.</LI><LI>Dr Neil Kad
    Principal investigator and allowed us to work in his lab after we had to vacant the teaching lab space at the start of term.</LI><LI>Dr Peter Ellis
    Dr Peter Ellis was an advisor who helped us perfect our project design with his knowledge on genetics</LI><LI>Dr Wei-Feng Xue
    Dr Wei-Feng Xue used to be PI for iGEM teams of Kent in the past and advised us on the important points of iGEM and the requirements for the competition. </LI><LI>Dr Gary Robinson
    Dr Gary Robinson was an advisor who helped us looking at the business side of the project and helped us form the future aspects of our project. He also advised on the possibilities with the Addgene purchases.</LI><LI>Dr Richard Williamson
Dr Richard Williamson offered us a space to exhibit our project and ideas on the Open Day of the School of Biosciences where we could liaise with prospective undergraduate students.  </LI><LI>
Ian Brown
Ian helped us with setting up the microscope and taking photos of our cells. He also gave us insight of how we might improve our design to enhance picture quality under the microscope.</LI><LI>Snapgene
Snapgene provided us with sponsorship for a free license for their plasmid visualisation software, which was crucial to the design of our biobrick and visualising any restriction sites, helping us carry out both restriction digests, ligations, and Gibson Assembly reactions, proving fundamental to the running of our project.</LI><LI>Integrated DNA Technologies
For providing us with 20kB of free DNA synthesis which we thoroughly took use of.</LI><LI>School of Biosciences at the University of Kent
For allowing us to work in teaching lab 1 over the summer and providing us with the equipment and expertise to enable us to compete in the igem competition in the first place. </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
