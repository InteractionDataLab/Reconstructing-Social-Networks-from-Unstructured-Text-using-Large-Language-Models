Achievements
This page shows the criteria that TCFSH_Taiwan has achieved this year.
Bronze
Register and attend:
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Deliverables:
Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page
Attribution:
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. (See more in Attribution )
Contribution/Part:
Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project related to BioBricks. This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
We add more introduction to the part BBa_K115002. (See more here )
Silver
Validated Part/Validated Contribution:
Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part of your own design that is central to your project works as expected. Document the experimental characterization of this part on the Main Page of that Partâ€™s Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (following Registry submission guidelines).
According to BBa_C0171 , BBa_K1541017 and BB_K115002 , we can assume all of our biobrick can work properly and logically, and we conduct an experiment on K2383200 and K2383302.
Collaboration:
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.
Members of TCFSH_Taiwan have helped NCTU_Formosa with bi-directional problems. And NCTU_Formosa helped us to participate in iGEM this year.(See more in Collaboration )
Human Practices:
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfill this criteria.
We've interviewed professors in different field in order to make sure that our project is safe, responsible, and good for the world. (See more in Silver HP )
Gold
Integrated Human Practices:
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Members of TCFSH_Taiwan have interviewed logistics and a food company in order to gain some precious suggestions about our project. (See more in Integrated and Gold )
Improve a previous part or project:
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other.
We add a LVA tag after the cj-Blue in order to accelerate the degration of the choromoprotein. (See more in here )
Model our project:
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
Members of TCFSH_Taiwan has modeled different concentration used in our project. We can simply our modeling to anyone, even someone with a non-mathematical background. (See more in Modeling )
