Composite Parts
We have know the function of two basic parts, the cjBlue-LVA and LacI without LVA. Hence, we create biobrick using the basic parts we mentioned and other different parts which will be mentioned below.
Composite BBa_K2383100
We us the cjBlue_LVA in this part, and add UirR, UirS into it. The biobrick will be like:
R0011 (Promoter) + B0034 (RBS) +BBa_k2383001 + B0034 (RBS) +BBa_K1725420 (UirR) + BBa_K1725410 (UirS)
Composite BBa_K2383200
This is a RhlR Regulating system with RNA thermometer. The biobrick will be like:
J23101 (Promoter) + BBa_K115002 (RBS) + BBa_K115002 + BBa_C0171 (RhlR) + BBa_K1541017 (RhlI)
Composite BBa_K2383300
This is a Report system of UV and Temperature with LacI. The biobrick will be like:
B0010 + B0012 + BBa_K2383010 (LacI) + B0034 + BBa_I14017 (Rhl) + BBa_K1725400 (PlsiR) + B0034 + E1010 + B0034 BBa_K2383010 (LacI)
Composite BBa_K2383301
This is a Report system of UV with LacI. The biobrick will be like:
BBa_K1725400 (PlsiR) + B0034 + E1010 (RFP) + B0034 + BBa_K2383010
Composite BBa_K2383302
This is a Report system of Temperature with LacI. The biobrick will be like:
BBa_K1725400 (PlsiR) + B0034 + BBa_K592009 + B0034 + BBa_K2383010 (LacI) + B0010 + B0012
These are the composite parts we use in our project.
