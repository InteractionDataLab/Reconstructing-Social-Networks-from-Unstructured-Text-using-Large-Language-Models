Abstract
DETECOLI—a word we created by combining “detection” and “E. coli”—changes color in environments of excess sunlight or high temperatures. The detection should be visualized by discriminating the alteration of three chromoproteins (cjBlue, RFP, BFP) expressed by E. coli with the regulatory circuit of temperature and UV light. We aim to build up a quantitative experiment for observing the color of E. coli. For the practical application we aim to place E. coli on stickers and attach the stickers on the product before delivery, thus able to monitor the whole process of transportation. DETECOLI alerts consumers to possible deterioration or contamination by changing color, and serves as a guarantee of quality.
