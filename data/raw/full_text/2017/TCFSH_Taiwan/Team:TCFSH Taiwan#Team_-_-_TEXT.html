School Introduction
In 1915, under Japanese occupation, Taiwanese forefathers Lin Lie-tang, Lin Hsien-tang, Lin Hsiung-cheng, Tsai Lien-fang, and Ku Hsien-jung pooled resources and donated land to build the high school to educate Taiwanese students with a view to awakening Taiwanese people's nationalism and cultural senses. After the foundation of the school in 1915, it has undergone several changes in the name of the school. Not until the year 2000 did the school finally get the name it now adopts, National Taichung First Senior High School. There are now 75 classes, including 63 general classes, 3 classes of high achievement in math and science, 3 class of high achievement in language, and 3 art-oriented  classes.

Hi! I'm Bo-Ching, Wu, and I am in 11th grade now. I like science and music. Hope to see you at Jamboree!
Jason Yang
I am a grade 11 student. My favorite subject is biology, and I especially love neuroscience. The working of brain, the secret of thinking, the origin of emotion, the storage of memories……, each of them arouse my interest. The sport I like is playing table tennis and swimming. In my leisure time, I even watch top players playing table tennis on Youtube.
