We would like to thank the following individuals and departments for their help in making our project this year a success: We are the pioneering team from West Africa for iGEM, and we FULLY acknowledge that it would be near impossible without their help and expertise.
Kwadwo Akyea Mensah, for helping us with lab logistics.
Ruth Okunu, for assisting us in running gels and also helping us numerous times with Lab logistics.
Festus Kojo Acquah, for showing us how to use the plate reader for our interlab measurement study.
Dr. Linda Amoah, for providing us with guidance and information to help us on our project.
Prof. Ben Gyan, for helping us in coordinating student outreach
IDT for helping to provide us with the genetic sequences that we did not know of.
Christopher Zanu for assisting in coding the Attributions page.
Special thanks to the Noguchi Memorial Institute for providing us a laboratory to work with and aiding us in all the ensuing logistics. Not forgetting all the guidance and constructive critiques they provided that helped us on our project.
OUR DEEPEST THANKS GOES TO ALL OF YOU.
