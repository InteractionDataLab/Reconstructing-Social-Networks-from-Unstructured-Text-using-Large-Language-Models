JUDGING FORM
We would like to apologize for the issue of the parts being received on time but not being accepted, due to mislabeling of the package. At the time of shipment, the package was open, and the shipper has seen the contents and was told that contains DNA samples in a plate sample holder. However only the specification of the plate sample holder was included on the shipping documents. We take full responsibility for not being more diligent and checking all the shipping requirements. In an effort to correct, an additional sample has been labeled properly and has been shipped.
We humbly request that you would consider the miscommunication with the shipper and will still accept our submission for the medal criteria. Thank you for your consideration and time.
Parts
NowGFP-golB (FRET DONOR) This part is a composite part composed of a green fluorescent protein (NowGFP) and a golB protein along with its own constitutive promoter, RBS and terminator with a spacer between the two genes. This composite part serves as the donor part of the FRET mechanism employed in this project. With the golB binding to gold atoms and the NowGFP giving off fluorescence to excite acceptor proteins.
High Potential Iron Sulphur Protein (HiPiP)This part is a composite part composed of a green fluorescent protein (NowGFP) and a golB protein along with its own constitutive promoter, RBS and terminator with a spacer between the two genes. This composite part serves as the donor part of the FRET mechanism employed in this project. With the golB binding to gold atoms and the NowGFP giving off fluorescence to excite acceptor proteins.
pH resistance EcoliThis part is a composite part composed of a pH_resistance gene. With its own constitutive promoter, RBS and a double terminator, the part is designed for the E.coli to provide pH resistance to enable it to survive in the bio-mining environment
pH resistance EcoliThis part is composed of a High potential iron-sulphur protein (HiPIP) with its own constitutive Promoter, RBS and double terminator. This part in addition to the Tetrathionate Hydrolase part enable the bacteria (E.coli) to liberate the gold from its ore similar to the way the Acidithiobacillus Ferrooxidans achieves this goal.
