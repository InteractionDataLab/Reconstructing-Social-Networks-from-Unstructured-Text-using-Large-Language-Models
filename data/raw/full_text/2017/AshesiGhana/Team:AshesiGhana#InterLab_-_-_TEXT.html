Introduction The Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study seeks to establish a GFP measurement protocol which could be used by anyone with a plate reader in their labs anywhere in the world. This measurement is however based on engineering principles. The major question being answered by this activity is “How precise will the measurements be when fluorescence is measured all around the world using different instruments?”
Materials and Methods For this study, the team has been provided with a total of 8 plasmids containing all composite parts required to undertake this activity. In addition to the composite parts a measurement kit to enable the team generate and analyse standard curves necessary for the analysis was also provided. This approach standardizes some of the variables of this experiment.

The transformation protocol was adapted from the iGEM protocol, which can be found on this link . All of the devices were transformed and cultured in LB (Luria Bertani) media containing 25 mg/mL chloramphenicol.
Results The results of the Interlab Study were tabulated in the following link .
Team Experience Engaging in this inter-lab activity was exciting and insightful. Since this was the first time the team was participating in the IGEM competition we took it as an opportunity to engage in as many activities including this inter-lab to have a complete experience of the competition. Coming from diverse fields in engineering and computer science, we as a team took this as an opportunity to learn new things in the world of synthetic biology and we can confidently say we learnt a lot working on this inter-lab activity.
