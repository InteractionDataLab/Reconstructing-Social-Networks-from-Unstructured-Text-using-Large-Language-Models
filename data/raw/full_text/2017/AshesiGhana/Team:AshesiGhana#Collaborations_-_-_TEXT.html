DTU – Biobuilders
We collaborated with the DTU-Biobuilders team by providing them with the contact information of a prominent snake bites researcher in our country, called Dr. Opoku Manu, since their project is about snake bites.
Prior to providing the DTU-Biobuilders team with the contact information of this snake bites researcher, we spoke to him on the behalf of the team and explained to him the primary objective of their project and he was delighted to help.
In return, the DTU-Biobuilders team provided us with a lot of invaluable advice and guidance in our preparations for this year’s IGEM since they had already been to the Jamboree a couple of times and this was our first time.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
We responded to UNebraska-Lincoln’s collaboration request on the IGEM Team Collaborations page by participating in the survey they conducted about reducing methane production in cattle. By participating in this survey, we contributed to the research that was being conducted by the team.
Institut Pasteur
We responded to their collaboration request on the IGEM Team Collaborations page by participating in a survey about the state of the quality of air in our country. By participating in this survey, we contributed to a body of information which was vital to the success of their research.
