Makeshift Incubator
Faced with the need of an incubator but without the actual device. We decided to create a make shift incubator, which involved using a LEGO Mindstorm EV3 and robot-c to interface.
The rotor is attached to our tubes and shieled with aluminium. Watch the video below to see it in action.
The hardware itself uses something like a piston and flywheel configuration to shake the tubes which are mounted on the piston
