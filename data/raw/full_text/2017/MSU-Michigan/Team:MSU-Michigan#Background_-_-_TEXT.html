Biosensing Water Contaminants with Genetically Engineered Shewanella oneidensis MR-1
As one of the most important natural resources, the declining quality of fresh water is a world-wide issue. Pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and heavy metals are rarely monitored and the need to detect and remove these compounds in an inexpensive way is what motivates this project. The marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could be a part of the solution through its unique ability to interact with electronics. The Mtr pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 is an external electron transportation pathway that is able to transfer electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode, thus generating electric current that is utilized in bioelectrochemical systems. We are utilizing S. oneidensis MR-1 â–³MtrB, the MtrB gene is removed, to prevent electron flow to an outside source through this key protein. We are then inserting a plasmid into this strain that contains the MtrB gene under control of a promoter that activates transcription of the protein when induced by compounds such as pesticides and metals in the water. This will allow for controlled electrical expression that can be used in microbial fuel cells to create a biosensor for the detection of these compounds. This biosensor will then be engineered to be manufactured on a large scale to be used for research, education, humanitarian efforts and even consumer use. Although the proof of concept is currently tested in a single chambered bioelectrochemical system, an affordable and portable paper microbial fuel cell system is currently in development.
Why?
As a Michigan team, water quality is an issue that hits very close to home. The Flint Water Crisis gained national attention for the extremely elevated lead contamination in the drinking water. This crisis began in 2014, however the Flint residents are advised to continue using filtered or bottled water until the pipes are fully replaced by the year 2020. Another famous American case of poor water quality is the Hinkley groundwater contamination made public by Erin Brockovich in 1993.
Mtr Pathway
The mtrB pathway harnesses electrons through metabolized lactate and transports the energy from mtrA to mtrC which is then capable of donating the electron to an external acceptor molecule. MtrB is the bridge between mtrA and mtrC, allowing the contact necessary for electron transport. In the absence of mtrB, it is predicted that mtrA will no longer associate with mtrC and therefore will hinder the external electron transport pathway.
Mtr External Electron Transportation pathway in S. oneidensis MR-1 Lactate dehydrogenase metabolizes lactate to pyruvate, transferring the released electrons to a quinone cycle in the membrane. CymA, coordinated the transfer of electrons from the quinone pool to mtrA. MtrB facilitates the interaction between mtrA and mtrC as the electrons flow to mtrC where they are accepted by an external molecule.
