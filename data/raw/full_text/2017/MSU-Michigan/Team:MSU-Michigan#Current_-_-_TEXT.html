Current from Induction
deltamtrB_GFPmtrB Induced V Uninduced
Same full vector strain but induction at point shown displaying the actuality of IPTG inducing current increase. This shows the difference between background expression and actual induction very distinctly.
deltamtrB_GFPmtrB Induced V Uninduced
The earlier graph compared to the one above. Shows how viability of cells earlier on produces a larger current increase compared to background expression.
Multiple Strains
Induction occurring at around 22 hours showing a doubling in current. The background control strains are shown here which display how little current is produced when mtrB is not present.
