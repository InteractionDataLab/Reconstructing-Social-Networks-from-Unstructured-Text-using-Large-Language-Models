Modeling
We modelled the small single cell bioreactors on drawing programs before building many of them.  We made sure that they were cost effective and are reasonable to build.  A per unit cost is presented in full detail in the drop down list below where the final total cost is $7.43.  This does not include a way to measure the current, which would be about another $30.00 depending on which Arduino board (1,2,3) you purchase and how you set it up.  This would bring the total cost up to $37.43, which is well within reason for a system that can be reused and will detect harmful contaminants in water.  The cost of a drinking water test can range from $50-270.  While these tests can detect more contaminants than our system currently can it would only take more genetically engineered Shewanella in order to match the range of tests at a significantly more affordable price.
