IPTG Induction
IPTG Induction of various strains of Shewanella Oneidnensis.
M5 Media Fluorescence
Control (M5 Media only) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate.
mtrB Induction Fluorescence
Induction of mtrB gene (no GFP, no mtrB insert) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate. - Acts as a second control
mtrB_GFP Induction Fluorescence
Induction of mtrB_GFP strain (GFP, no mtrB insert) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate.  This is the highest because resources are not being directed toward the mtrB pathway, which is still removed
mrtB_GFP_mtrB Induction Fluorescence
Induction of mtrB_GFP_mtrB strain (GFP, mtrB insert) for proof of IPTG induction at different concentrations, measured by GFP fluorescence in a 96-well plate.
