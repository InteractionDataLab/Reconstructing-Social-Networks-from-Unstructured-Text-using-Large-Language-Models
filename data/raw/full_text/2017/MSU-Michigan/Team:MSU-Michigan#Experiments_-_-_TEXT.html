Growth Fluorescence
Growth Fluorescence
This procedure is to test the fluorescence of modified Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.
Grow overnight cultures of ∆mtrB, ∆mtrB prL814 and ∆mtrB prL814-mtrB in 5mL LB and add 5 μL of 1000X Spectinomycin to ∆mtrB prL814 and ∆mtrB prL814-mtrB.
Incubate at 30ºC and shaking at 275 rpm.
Spin down the overnight cultures at 10,000X g for 5 minutes and then discard the supernatant.
Re-suspend the cells in 1mL of M5 media with 1X Wolfe’s vitamins and minerals.
Check OD 600 on spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Part No: 2231000288-P17). Note: Blank spectrophotometer with M5 media.
Dilute the original culture re-suspension to an OD 600 of 0.1 using M5 media. Note: Use C 1 V 1 =C 2 V 2 to end up with a total OD 600 of 0.1 in a total volume of 5mL for each strain to have enough diluted culture to add to 96 well plate. Add 5μL of Spectinomycin to ∆mtrB prL814 and ∆mtrB prL814-mtrB
Pipet 100 μL of each strain and background M5 into 96 well plate (VWR, Part No: 82050- 052) such that 4 technical replicates of each strain and background M5 are obtained for the following concentrations of IPTG: 0 μM, 50 μM, 100 μM, 150 μM, 200 μM and 250 μM. Note: 250 μM determined to be beginning of saturation based on preliminary experiments.
Parafilm the plate to avoid condensation buildup.
Running the plate on a reader
Program software (Bio-Tek, Gen5 3.02) to measure OD 600 and Fluorescence simultaneously in plate reader (Bio-Tek, Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Reader).
Program following conditions: Set plate type to Greiner 96 Black Flat Bottom Fluotrac and check the use lid box. Set temperature to 30ºC and start kinetic (Run= 3:00:00, Interval= 0:15:00) with orbital shaking (Continuous, Orbital Frequency= 307 cpm, fast orbital speed) and reading OD 600 (Full plate, normal read speed, no pathlength correction) and reading GFP (Excitation= 485/20, Emission: 528/20, Optics position= top, Gain= 75, normal read speed, Read Height= 6.00mm). End this kinetic and insert a stop/resume pause step. Start a new kinetic (Run= 48:10:00, Interval= 0:15:00) with orbital shaking and reading OD 600 along with GFP under the same conditions as first kinetic. End this kinetic step. Note: Save this experiment as these conditions will be used throughout plate reader experiments.
Run the plate and once the pause step has been reached, remove the plate and induce with varying amounts of IPTG.
Resume running the next kinetic after the plate has been induced and run till completion.
Bioreactors Current Measurement
This procedure is to test the current output of modified Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.
Assembling Carbon Electrodes
Cut out a 25 x 25 mm piece of carbon felt (Alfa Aesar, Part No: 43200) with a razor  blade.
Insert 15 cm long titanium wire (Malin Co., .025 Titanium) horizontally through the felt, and bend in a loop back into the bottom of the electrode.
Apply carbon cement (Fluka Analytical, Part No: 09929-30G) to the wire, where it contacts the felt. Add Xylene (Jade Scientific, Part No: JS-X0250) and stir to ensure carbon cement remains in a liquid state.
Allow to dry for at least five hours under a fume hood.
Deoxidize by submerging in a container of dH 2 O and tap against a solid surface to remove trapped oxygen in the carbon felt. Further remove oxygen by purging the gas via pressurizing anaerobic chamber to 20psi then depressurizing (2X).
Stoppers
Drill a hole (0.5 in. (1.27 cm) diameter) through the rubber tapered round plug  (McMaster-Carr, trade size: #12) for the reference electrode.
Drill a hole (0.5 in. (1.27 cm) diameter) halfway through for the counter electrode  housing.  Note: Make sure to apply soap/water solution to stopper and inside drill bit to prevent clogging.
Remove the plunger and cut a 3 mL plastic syringe (BD, Part No: 309657) to size for the counter electrode housing. Add punctures throughout to allow release of hydrogen gas. Insert securely in the hole drilled halfway through the stopper. Note: Cut off needle side of syringe housing to allow prevent air pocket formation.
String titanium wire through the plastic housing for the counter electrode. Note: The end of the titanium wire should be in the middle of the plastic housing.
Insert a sterile 18 gauge needle (BD, Part No: 305196) through the rubber stopper and into the housing to allow for ventilation of hydrogen gas. Bend to the side and cover with foil.
Insert second sterile 18 gauge needle through stopper away from electrode connections for ventilation during autoclaving. Bend to side and cover with aluminum foil.
String the wire of the carbon felt electrode through the stopper.
Final assembly before autoclaving
Fill each Mason jar (Ball, Part No: 750097) with 125 mL of M5 media. Add stir bar   (McMaster-Carr, Part No: 5678K111).
Place assembled stopper into the jar. Ensure the electrode is completely submerged  in media.
Push a long sterile stainless steel needle (Part No: 5FTZ1) through the stopper for sampling and ensure it reaches down into the solution. Screw on a male luer cap (McMaster-Carr, Part No: 51525K371)
Insert a sterile 18 gauge needle that does not interfere with the other hardware for venting. Cover with foil. This needle will be used to inject various additives.  Note: [Place Figure 9 here]
Autoclave bioreactors in a liquid cycle for 35 minutes. Allow to cool before adding  vitamin/mineral solution and antibiotic.
Use the inserted 18 gauge needle to add up to total volume of 140 mL: 1.25 mL Wolfe's minerals, 1.25 mL of Wolfe’s vitamins (no riboflavin) and 12.5 mL of 200 mM lactate (carbon source).
Add 140 µL of Spectinomycin antibiotic to reactors with antibiotic resistant strains. Note: Antibiotics are prepared at 50mg/mL concentrations.
Oxidation the silver electrode
Cut a 6 cm long piece of silver wire (Sigma Aldrich, Part No: 265608) and insert through a rubber tapered round plug (McMaster-Carr, trade size: #C).
Add 1 g of KCl Crystal (J.T. Baker, Part No: 3040-05) to 50mL of dH 2 O in a small beaker.
Insert a carbon rod (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Part No: 70230), Ag/AgCl reference electrode (BASi, Part No: MF- 2052) and silver electrode into dilute KCl solution.
Connect white wire (REF 2) from potentiostat (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Part No: VMP3) to Ag/AgCl reference electrode, connect blue wire (REF 3) to a carbon rod and connect red wire (REF 1) to silver electrode.  Note: Connections should not touch inside beaker and alligator clips from potentiostat wires should not contact the solution.
Program EC-Lab software to the following settings: Set electrical potential (E we ) to - 0.200V (E i ) vs Ref. (Ag-AgCl), hold for 0.0 min (E i for t i ) and record every 1.00 sec (dt i ). Scan electrical potential (E we ) over time (dE/dt= 20.0mV/s) to vertex potential (E 1 = 0.400V vs Ref) then hold for 10.0 min (E 1 for t 1 ) and record every 1.00 sec (dt 1 ). Reverse scan electrical potential (E we ) to vertex potential (E 2 = 0.300V vs Ref) then hold for 0.0 min (E 2 for t 2 ) and record every 0.10 sec (dt 2 ). Measure current (<I>) over the last 50% of the step duration, record current (<I>) averaged over one voltage steps (N= 1), repeat cycle zero times (n c = 0) and record the first and every cycle for 2 cycles (n r = 2). Set sensitivity to specified settings (E Range= -10.0V; 10.0V). Leave current and bandwidth at default settings (I Range=Auto, Bandwidth= 5-medium).  Note: Save these settings as they will be used for every experiment.
Run these preprogrammed settings. Note: Wire should change to a brown/purple color when reduction is complete (~ 10 min.). Note: Placing the silver electrodes in concentrated household bleach for 30 min. also oxidizes them
To prepare the reference electrode
Combine 50 mL of dH 2 O and 0.75 g Bacto Agar (BD, Part No: 214010) in a 100 mL glass beaker, containing a small stir bar (McMaster-Carr, Part No: 5678K111).
On a heat/stir plate, stir (650 rpm) and heat (~300 ◦ C) until Agar dissolves and  solution appears clear Note: May have a slightly yellow tint.
Add KCl Crystal until saturated. Look for particles to start settling at the bottom (~ 23  g).
Pour the hot solution into a glass cylinder reference electrode (Custom made, dimensions: [Place Figure 10 here]), stoppered by 60 mm long Magnesia stick (Sigma Aldrich, Part No: 31408)) , filling it halfway. Insert a syringe with stainless steel needle (see 1.19) into the bottom and draw up any air before filling the cylinder.
Insert the reduced silver wire that is connected into the rubber stopper and create a  secure seal.
Wipe off any excess salt around the reference with water and Kim wipes.
Programming potentiostat:
Connect potentiostat to EC-Lab software.
Program EC-Lab to the following settings: Apply 0.200V (E i ) vs Ref. (Ag-AgCl) for the amount of run time desired (t i ). Leave limits at default settings (I max , I min = “pass” mA, (|ΔQ|> ΔQ M )= 0.0 mAh). Record data every second (dt a =1.00 s). Leave sensitivity at default settings (E Range= -2.5V; 2.5V). Leave current and bandwidth at default settings (I Range=Auto, Bandwidth= 5-medium).  Note: Save these setting because they will be used for every reactor over all experiments.
Running the bioreactors
Place bioreactors on a low profile magnetic stirrer (VWR, Part No: 10153-690),  careful to position stir bar to avoid damaging hardware.
Connect to potentiostat by attaching white wire (REF 2) to reference electrode, attach blue wire (REF 3) to counter electrode and attach red wire (REF 1) to carbon felt electrode.
Inspect the units for anything out of place or for bubbles in the counter electrode  housing. This will cause errors in potentiostat readings.
Turn on the stir plate and ensure the stir bars are stable. Run the reactors without  bacteria for at least 2 hours to obtain baseline values.
Inoculate with bacteria, dilute to an OD 600 of 0.01 () in a final volume of 140 mL. Note: C i , V i refer to initial concentration and initial volume, respectively. C f , V f refer to final concentration and final volume respectively.
Bacterial strains grown in the reactors include: ΔmtrB (negative control), ΔmtrB  prL814 (positive control) and ΔmtrB prL814-mtrB.
Allow growth in the bioreactor overnight. Use a syringe to remove 2 mL for sampling  to measure OD 600 and GFP fluorescence.
Induce with 200 µM concentration of 0.1M IPTG once current begins to decrease. Note: The 200 µM was determined to be optimal concentration based on previous preliminary experiments.
Disposal
Disconnect all leads from potentiostat.
Soak all parts in a diluted bleach solution for 30 minutes, wash with soap, and rinse  with dH2O.  Note: When removing glass reference housing from stopper use soap to avoid breaking housing.
Dispose of used carbon felt electrodes as biohazardous waste.
Allow all parts to dry for a minimum of 5 hours in a drying cabinet.
