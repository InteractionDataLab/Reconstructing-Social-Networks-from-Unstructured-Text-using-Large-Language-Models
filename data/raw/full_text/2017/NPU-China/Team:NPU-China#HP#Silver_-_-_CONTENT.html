                        Synthetic biology from the School of Astronautics, the school of Automation, and the School of Mechatronics
                        and Engineering and so on.</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H3>Laboratory---To offer more students access to the biology laboratory!

                    </H6><H4>We organized nearly 40 students to visit our lab and introduced all sorts of instruments to them at length.
                        The students are differentiated by various majors--Automation Engineering, Electronic Information
                        Science and Technology, Chemistry and so on. There is no escaping the fact that students from other
                        majors, constitute a large proportion of our team rather than those majoring in Biology.

                    </H6><H4>We had a discussion on our project's basis and innovation with leaders and teachers from our Life Science
                        Academy. Meanwhile, we asked them for the project’s novelty and environmental friendliness. Leaders
                        and teachers put forward the significance of innovation, inspiring us to create new things during
                        the project process and create new ideas. In addition, we got suggestions on the safety and environmental
                        protection during our experiments.

                    </H6><H4>To narrow the gap between the lab and the factory, we asked entrepreneurs for ideas about how to innovatively
                        and feasibly design our project, and they suggested that biosafety of our project should be more emphasized.
                        In August 2017, under the leadership of our teacher, some of our NPU-CHINA team members paid a visit to Xi'an Aerospace
                        Sanwo Chemical Co., Ltd based on the theme of &quot;Acrylic Application and Sustainable
                        Development&quot;. During the communication, we explained the concept of synthetic biology to the entrepreneurs. Meanwhile,
                        they advised that we could also show the biosafety of our project.

                        on synthetic biology related areas all gathered in FAFU Conference Center, having a wonderful
