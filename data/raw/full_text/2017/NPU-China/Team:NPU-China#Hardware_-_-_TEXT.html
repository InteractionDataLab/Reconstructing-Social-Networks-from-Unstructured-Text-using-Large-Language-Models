Protocols
The theme of our project this year is Manufacture, so we have been trying to contrive a series of hardwares                         to model the industrial production and enhance our method. However, the gap does exist between the                         reality and our expectation.
List of what we use
By listing the main items we have purchased and actually used, we hope to provide some experience and                         inspiration for the future teams wishing to have HW productions.
Hardware Design
Our system is mainly composed of two parts: reaction part and concentrated crystallization part. The                         overall idea is that the reaction part provides the bacteria with appropriate reaction temperature,                         adequate oxygen and the prevention of bacterial precipitation. After a certain period of time, the                         reaction solution will be transferred to the concentrated crystallization part, where the concentration                         of the production is increased by the reverse osmosis membrane; the temperature of the reaction                         solution is lowered by the device, and the acrylic acid is finally crystallized.
1）Reaction Part
The reaction part mainly uses miniature DC self-priming pump, foam machine, acrylic material container,                         aluminum hollow cylinder (built-in heating wire) and NTC thermistor temperature sensor.

Instruction：When the system starts, the pump will continue to pump the upper reaction solution, which                         will blend a large number of air bubbles after passing through the foam machine, and then will be pumped                         back from the bottom reaction container. Furthermore, since the reaction vessel is cylindrical and                         the bubbles are continuously rising, the purpose of stirring the reaction solution and providing                         sufficient air can be achieved. Simultaneously, with the help of the temperature sensor, the system                         will be able to control heating wire inside the aluminum alloy cylinder, so that the reaction solution                         can maintain a suitable temperature range. Also, the poor thermal conductivity of acrylic materials                         is conducive to insulation. (We had considered heating the air mixed with the reaction solution at                         the foaming machine so that the reaction solution pumped back to the reaction vessel would be blended                         with a large amount of hot air, which could replace the additional heating device, but due to the                         safety and energy efficiency, this thought was given up.)
2）Concentrated Crystallization Part
After the reaction has been performed for one cycle, the reaction part stops, and the reaction solution                         is thus introduced into the concentrated crystallization part and the work begins.
In this part we mainly use the acrylic material container, aluminum alloy cold source (including                         collection function), reverse osmosis membrane, pressure pump, temperature sensor, water level sensor                         and semiconductor cooling film, etc.

Instruction:Concentrated crystallization part is relatively independent. As long as the system detects                         that the internal water level is higher than the reverse osmosis membrane, the part will start to                         work. With the pressure pump and reverse osmosis membrane, the water of the reaction solution will                         be continuously extracted, which continues to improve the concentration of acrylic acid. And the                         semiconductor cooling film will help keep the solution temperature below the melting point                         of acrylic acid, which is 286K. After many rounds of cycles, acrylic acid crystals can be collected on the                         bottom cooling source (but mixed with engineered bacteria).
3）System Controlling
In order to keep as much as possible in line with the actual industrial production, our device involves                         a lot of electronic components, pumps, etc., so we designed a set of controlling procedures.
For the sake of our lack of experience and staff, we chose to master the Arduino controlling board due                         to its lower difficulty, which shortened our production time. In addition, we also use 1602LCD display,                         Relay module, NTC thermistor temperature sensor, adjustable DC power supply, semiconductor cooling                         film, arduino controlling panel, water level sensor, DuPont lines, LCD1602 LCD adapter board, Motor                         drive extension and so on.

Impression summary
Besides no relevant laboratory and company support, our staff is also scarce (the main staff is only                         one person). We had a difficult time accomplishing our initial HW work. So in this part, we hope to be able                         to provide a profound lesson.
Before the actual production and debugging, full consideration and deduction must be carried out.                         The delivery of the things bought often cost two or three days (In China, we mainly shop online,                         so the delivery time needs to be considered), and the purchase of goods may be inconsistent with what                         we wanted. Plus, the negligence of some important details may also lead to the purchase of wrong things,                         which will waste a lot of valuable time.
