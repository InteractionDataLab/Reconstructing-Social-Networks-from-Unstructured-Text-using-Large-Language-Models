We are introducing our project
We participated in the Forum on Life Science of Shaanxi University League on 3, June, 2017, where we                         introduced our project to other 4 universities in Shaanxi, including Xidian University, Northwest                         University, Northwest A&F University and Shaanxi Normal University. Our address has been acclaimed                         by the students, making more people privy to iGEM and provoke their great interest. We hold the firm                         belief that our Human practice has managed to accord our fraternal colleges that were not yet familiar                         with the rubrics or notions of iGEM with a brand-new horizon and platform, which is in perfect line                         with the tenet of globalization advancement of iGEM.
Simultaneously, precious advice from other universities has been obtained via the demonstration of our                         project. For instance, some students aroused puzzlement about our Mathematical Modeling and suggested                         that the closer relationship between the modeling and experiments be highly needed. Also, there were                         questions about the construction of our metabolic pathway in terms of production and feasibility.                         And all the questions raised have made us understand and then revamp our project in a more objective                         perspective.
