1.pSBC3-ADH1+gld+tGPD1
In this part, the promoter of gld is ADH1 promoter, and the terminator is tGPD1 terminator. ADH1 promoter is a kind of promoter which has strong expression and tGPD1 terminator is a terminator with rather strong                          expression ability. So they can both increase the expression of genes. At the same time they are constitutive                          promoters and terminators, which have the ability to integrate gene fragment, gld, into the chromosome of                          yeast, thereby reducing the burden of plasmid expression in yeast. We linked this part with part                         pSBC3-PGK1 + DAK + TPFK1 and the YCplac33 plasmid vector to form intact plasmid with URA deficient.
2.pSBC3-PGK1+DAK+TPFK1
In this part, the promoter of DAK is PGK1 promoter, and the terminator is TPFK1 terminator. PGK1 promoter                           is a kind of promoter which has strong expression and TPFK1 terminator is a terminator with rather strong                          expression ability. So they can both increase the expression of genes. At the same time they are constitutive                           promoters and terminators, which have the ability to integrate gene fragment, DAK, into the chromosome                          of yeast, thereby reducing the burden of plasmid expression in yeast. We linked this part with part                          pSBC3-ADH1+gld+tGPD1 and the YCplac33 plasmid vector to form intact plasmid with URA deficient.
pSBC3-ADH1+gld+tGPD1 & pSBC3-PGK1+DAK+TPFK1
The enzyme GlyDH (gld) and DAK can be efficiently expressed in the yeast cell, and the gene of the             enzyme GlyDH (gld) and DAK are integrated into the chromosome. In this pathway, GlyDH (Glycerol             dehydrogenase) can efficiently convert glycerol to DHA (1,3-Dihydroxyacetone), and then DAK             (Dihydroxyacetone kinase) phosphorylate DHA into DHAP, and then DHAP is catalyzed into acrylic acid             by ceaS2.
3.pSBC3-pTDH3+ceas2+tPFK1
In this part, the promoter of ceaS2 is pTDH3 promoter, and the terminator is tPFK1 terminator. pTDH3                           promoter is a kind of promoter which has strong expression and tPFK1 terminator is a terminator with                          rather strong expression ability. So they can both increase the expression of genes. At the same time they                            are constitutive promoters and terminators, which have the ability to integrate gene fragment, ceaS2, into                          the chromosome of yeast, thereby reducing the burden of plasmid expression in yeast. We linked this part                           with the YCplac33 plasmid vector to form intact plasmid with LEU deficient.
In the yeast cells, the enzyme ceaS2 can be efficiently expressed and the gene of ceas2 is integrated into             the chromosome. With the help of TPP (Thiamine pyrophosphate) and magnesium ions, ceaS2 can              catalyze the production of acrylic acid with DHAP (dihydroxy acetone phosphate) and G3P              (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ) as substrate.
4.pSBC3-TEF2+NOX+tRPS2
In this part, the promoter of NOX is TEF2 promoter, and the terminator is tRPS2 terminator. TEF2 promoter is              a kind of promoter which has strong expression and tRPS2 terminator is a terminator with rather strong              expression ability. So they can both increase the expression of genes. At the same time they are constitutive             promoters and terminators, which have the ability to integrate gene fragment, NOX, into the chromosome              of yeast, thereby reducing the burden of plasmid expression in yeast. We linked this part with part              pSBC3-pTDH3+ceas2+tPFK1and the YCplac33 plasmid vector to form intact plasmid with LEU deficient.
It can efficiently express the enzyme NOX in yeast and integrate NOX into the chromosome. Since GlyDH             is an NAD+ -dependent enzyme, NOX and CAT(which already exists in yeast) provide the required             reduction force for GLYDH through the two layers of substrate level cycle.
