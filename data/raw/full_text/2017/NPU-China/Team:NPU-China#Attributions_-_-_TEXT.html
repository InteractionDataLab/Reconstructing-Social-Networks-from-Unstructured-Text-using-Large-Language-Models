Our project is a team-work involving in 13 undergraduates divided into seven groups. Each group was responsible for one aspect such as WIKI construction, art design, wet-lab work, human practices and so on.
1.Team set-up and management
Zexun Wu set up the NPU-China 2017 team and serves as the captain and is in charge of accomplishment of the whole project.
Yun Liu is responsible for financial affairs.
2. Wet-lab work
Xin Hu, Qi Li, Zexun Wu,Yuan Zhang, Weifeng Lin,                      Xinhu and Qi Li are in charge of the plasmid construction, gene transformation and whole cell catalysis. They are also in charge of the gene knockout work in S. cerevisiae. Zexun Wu, Yun Liu, Weifeng Lin are in charge of gene knockout work in E.Coli and have done the work about HPLC and safety. Xin Hu is the general experiment leader of Wet-lab work too.
3．Hardware
WeiWei Qin is in chare of the design，construction of our hardware and Weifeng Lin helps him do some works at usual.
4. Art Design
Chenyuan Li is responsible for Art Designs including the designs for our team clothing, posters, banner, wiki.
5. Wiki
Yuhan Ke, Zexun Wu, Bingzhao Zhuo, Chenyuan Li worked to accomplish the design and construction of WIKI contents.
6. Human Practices
Zexun Wu is responsible for planning and organizing the HP including every social activities.
7. Modeling
Our metabolic flow model is finished by Weixu Wang in SCAU-China. Yutong Bai is responsible for translating them into English.

1. Special thanks
We are grateful to Bingzhao Zhuo, who helps us set-up a team and knock-out two genes in E.Coli at the beginning of our project. Our project was supported by grants from the                      Research Center for Ecology and Environmental Sciences of NPU, Tianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Siences, the College of Life Sciences.
2. Lab support
Our project was mainly conducted in TIB Yeast Genomic Engineering Lab and the lab of Research Center for Ecology and Environmental Sciences of NPU. These two laboratories are both leading research units focusing on synbio. Therefore, we can successfully carry out our experiments including knock out genes using CRISPR/Cas9 as well as the construction of plasmid and so on.
3. Human practices support
During the human practices, we received many help and assistances from people and organizations, such as the Xidian University(Holding the forum), Xi’an Aerospace Sunvalor Chemical CO., Ltd, FAFU-China(Holding the CCiC), SCUT-FSE-CHINA(collaborated with us on HP).
