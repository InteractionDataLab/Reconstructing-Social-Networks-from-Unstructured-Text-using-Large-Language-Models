Overview
The aim of the interlab this year was to explore--
"How close can the numbers be when fluorescence is measured all around the world?"
Participating in the interlab was a valuable experience, and it allowed us to make use of technology                         we had at our disposal that otherwise wasn’t relevant to our project. It added an extra dimension                         to our lab work, and was a lot of fun!
1. OD600 reference point
2. Fluorescein standard curve
3. Raw Plate Reader Measurements
Observation
1. It can be easily observed that Device1 and Device 4 didn’t grow after 6 hours. In fact, Device1 express high level of                             GFP after being cultured all night long.
2.In Fluorescein standard curve, it’s not linear when the concentration is high. But the Fluorescein                             in Raw Plate Reader Measurements doesn’t reach the the non-linear region so the standard curve                             is believable.
3. It was found there was great variation in readings when using different settings on the plate                             reader. Given that iGEM HQ has kept the protocol consistent, it is suggested that the desired                             plate reader settings are also specified to ensure consistency throughout the results.
4. The dilution forum provided by iGEM foundation is useful. After dilution, almost every OD600                             is around 0.04.
