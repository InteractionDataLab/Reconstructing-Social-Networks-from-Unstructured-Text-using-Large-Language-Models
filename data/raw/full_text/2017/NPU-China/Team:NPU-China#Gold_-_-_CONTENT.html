                Aerospace Sanwo Chemical Co., Ltd., Yanliang District, Xi’an, based on the the theme &quot;acrylic application
                and sustainable development”. Company technical leader Gao Jianbin warmly welcomed the arrival of our team,
                and then arranged for the visit, together with the Minister Gao Yuan, led us to visit the company's acrylic
                adhesive production department.
                 We firstly visited the factory's acrylic adhesive production department. After wearing the white coat and
                releasing the body static, we entered the workshop. We were surprised at the inside of the real factory,
                having witnessed a series of acrylic products that were only seen on the Internet. Also, we touched and got
                to understand the acrylic adhesive reactor on our own; entered the reaction controlling room, which truly
                offered us the sense of convenience that technology brings to us. Technical director Gao Jianbin told us
                that acrylic and acrylic monomer are together poured into the reactor. By adjusting the temperature, pressure
                and other reaction conditions, we can control the output of acrylic adhesive. Entering the production line
                on our own enabled us to grasp a better understanding of the operating mechanism and equipment.
                 It is worthwhile to mention that the company's acrylic adhesive production is up to about 5000t / year,
                ranking the leading position in the production of adhesives that are widely used in automotive insulation
                film, special tape, electronic protective film and other fields. And the adhesive applied in automotive insulation
                film accounts for nearly 60% of the market share, which indicates a broad prospect.
                 After the visit, the technical leader Gao Jianbin arranged for us to go to the conference room for a deeper
                talk. Team leader Wu Zexun briefed on the relevant knowledge of synthesis biology. And introduced to the
                company staff about our project --- the biological synthesis of acrylic acid based on the chassis organisms
                and glycerol, which appealed much to the company staff and was highly acclaimed. It’s known to us all that
                the current acrylic products mainly come from oil-related products, whose high energy consumption, heavy
                environmental pollution, lack of sustainability and other shortcomings will all be outshined by the merits
                of synthetic biology method.
                 We are delighted that the leaders Gao Jianbin and Luo Bao and Gao Yuan have offered us a load of inspirational
                ideas in practical application and factory operation. Some questions they raised haven’t been taken into
                our consideration in terms of economic efficiency and ultimate products. They suggested that, in addition
                to the points of green and sustainable development, we could also clarify the superiority of our project
                from the security aspect, which is the fundament of an enterprise. We were marveled that if we didn’t enter
                the factory in person, it would be almost impossible for us to explore more superiorities of our project.
                 We came into contact with a lot of practical knowledge at the meeting, which can never be learnt on the
                Internet or from books. Technical director Gao Jianbin also told us that acrylic acid is exceedingly broadly
                applied ranging from the phone scratch-resistant screen to the aircraft paint, according us with a more profound
                understanding of the application of acrylic acid.

                Jinshan campus. Nearly 50 iGEM college teams and high school teams from all over the country , non-participating
                teams and special guests and scholars working on synthetic biology related areas all gathered in FAFU Conference
                Center, conducting a wonderful talk about exchanges and sharing.
                 During the posters display and break, our project poster designed by Li Chenyuan, the art director, succeeded
                to attract numerous students and entrepreneurs. Zhuo Bingzhao, the team advisor, and the head of experiment
                Hu Xin explained at length about the contents and answered the questions and puzzlements from many iGEMers,
                which gained the “Best Poster” labelling.
                 We thus delivered a speech and introduction regarding our project.
                 During the wonderful 20 minutes, the team leader Wu Zexun expanded upon the project to the students and
                teachers present, Bluepha CEO Li Teng and iGEM HQ King L. Chow about the background of project, selection
                of chassis organisms, transformation of enzymes, reconstruction and optimization of metabolic pathway, modeling
                and the current experimental results. Team member Qin Weiwei and Zhang Jiani made a detailed introduction
                of Hardware and Human Practice respectively, which has obtained a wealth of questions and attention from
                the audience. The problems raised touch on many aspects, such as the principle and promotion of the enzyme
                transformation platform, the matching of production and industrialization, and the safety, inspiring us to
                bolster and enhance our project.
                 Simultaneously, we want to convey our acknowledgements to South China Agricultural University and University
                of Science and Technology from their devotion into our metabolic flux modeling.
