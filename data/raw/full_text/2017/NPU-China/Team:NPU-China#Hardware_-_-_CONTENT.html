                        to model the industrial production and enhance our method. However, the gap does exist between the
                        reality and our expectation.
                    </H4><H3 style="text-align:center">List of what we use</H3><H4>By listing the main items we have purchased and actually used, we hope to provide some experience and
                        inspiration for the future teams wishing to have HW productions.
                    </H4><H3 style="text-align:center">Hardware Design</H3><H4>Our system is mainly composed of two parts: reaction part and concentrated crystallization part. The
                        overall idea is that the reaction part provides the bacteria with appropriate reaction temperature,
                        adequate oxygen and the prevention of bacterial precipitation. After a certain period of time, the
                        reaction solution will be transferred to the concentrated crystallization part, where the concentration
                        of the production is increased by the reverse osmosis membrane; the temperature of the reaction
                        solution is lowered by the device, and the acrylic acid is finally crystallized.
                    </H4><H4>1）Reaction Part</H4><H4>The reaction part mainly uses miniature DC self-priming pump, foam machine, acrylic material container,
                        aluminum hollow cylinder (built-in heating wire) and NTC thermistor temperature sensor.
                    </H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:30px"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig1 Miniature DC self - priming pump</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig2 Hollow cylinder made of aluminum alloy</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:30px"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig3 Container made of Acrylics</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig4 3D design drawing Booster pump</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><H4>Instruction：When the system starts, the pump will continue to pump the upper reaction solution, which
                        will blend a large number of air bubbles after passing through the foam machine, and then will be pumped
                        back from the bottom reaction container. Furthermore, since the reaction vessel is cylindrical and
                        the bubbles are continuously rising, the purpose of stirring the reaction solution and providing
                        sufficient air can be achieved. Simultaneously, with the help of the temperature sensor, the system
                        will be able to control heating wire inside the aluminum alloy cylinder, so that the reaction solution
                        can maintain a suitable temperature range. Also, the poor thermal conductivity of acrylic materials
                        is conducive to insulation. (We had considered heating the air mixed with the reaction solution at
                        the foaming machine so that the reaction solution pumped back to the reaction vessel would be blended
                        with a large amount of hot air, which could replace the additional heating device, but due to the
                        safety and energy efficiency, this thought was given up.)
                    </H4><H4>2）Concentrated Crystallization Part</H4><H4>After the reaction has been performed for one cycle, the reaction part stops, and the reaction solution
                        is thus introduced into the concentrated crystallization part and the work begins.
                         In this part we mainly use the acrylic material container, aluminum alloy cold source (including
                        collection function), reverse osmosis membrane, pressure pump, temperature sensor, water level sensor
                        and semiconductor cooling film, etc.
                    </H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:30px"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig5 Container made of Acrylics</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig6 Cold source produced by aluminum alloy</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:30px"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig7 Reverse osmosis RO membrane andsemiconductor refrigeration chip</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><H4>Fig8 Booster pump</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:30px" align="center"><H4>Fig9 3D design drawing</H4></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><H4>Instruction:Concentrated crystallization part is relatively independent. As long as the system detects
                        that the internal water level is higher than the reverse osmosis membrane, the part will start to
                        work. With the pressure pump and reverse osmosis membrane, the water of the reaction solution will
                        be continuously extracted, which continues to improve the concentration of acrylic acid. And the
                        semiconductor cooling film will help keep the solution temperature below the melting point
                        of acrylic acid, which is 286K. After many rounds of cycles, acrylic acid crystals can be collected on the
                        bottom cooling source (but mixed with engineered bacteria).</H4><H4> 3）System Controlling</H4><DIV class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:10px"><H4> In order to keep as much as possible in line with the actual industrial production, our device involves
                        a lot of electronic components, pumps, etc., so we designed a set of controlling procedures.
                         For the sake of our lack of experience and staff, we chose to master the Arduino controlling board due
                        to its lower difficulty, which shortened our production time. In addition, we also use 1602LCD display,
                        Relay module, NTC thermistor temperature sensor, adjustable DC power supply, semiconductor cooling
                        film, arduino controlling panel, water level sensor, DuPont lines, LCD1602 LCD adapter board, Motor
                        drive extension and so on.
                         Here is our main program of the controlling system:<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/4/48/Main_program_of_the_controlling_system.docx">(DOWNLOAD HERE!)</A></H4><H3 style="text-align:center">Video</H3><H3 style="text-align:center">Impression summary</H3><H4>Besides no relevant laboratory and company support, our staff is also scarce (the main staff is only
                        one person). We had a difficult time accomplishing our initial HW work. So in this part, we hope to be able
                        to provide a profound lesson.
                         Before the actual production and debugging, full consideration and deduction must be carried out.
                        The delivery of the things bought often cost two or three days (In China, we mainly shop online,
                        so the delivery time needs to be considered), and the purchase of goods may be inconsistent with what
                        we wanted. Plus, the negligence of some important details may also lead to the purchase of wrong things,
                        which will waste a lot of valuable time.
                         If you want to know more or cooperate with us, welcome to contact us.
