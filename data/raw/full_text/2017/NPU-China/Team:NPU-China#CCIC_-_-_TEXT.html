On 28th August this year, the 4th CCiC managed to be held in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University                         FAFU, Jinshan campus. Nearly 50 iGEM college teams and high school teams from all over the country                         , non-participating teams and special guests and scholars working on synthetic biology related areas                         all gathered in FAFU Conference Center, conducting a wonderful talk about exchanges and sharing.
During the posters display and break, our project poster designed by Li Chenyuan, the art director,                         succeeded to attract numerous students and entrepreneurs. Zhuo Bingzhao, the team advisor, and the                         head of experiment Hu Xin explained at length about the contents and answered the questions and puzzlements                         from many iGEMers, which gained the “Best Poster” labelling.
We thus delivered a speech and introduction regarding our project.
During the wonderful 20 minutes, the team leader Wu Zexun expanded upon the project to the students                         and teachers present, Bluepha CEO Li Teng and iGEM HQ King L. Chow about the background of project,                         selection of chassis organisms, transformation of enzymes, reconstruction and optimization of metabolic                         pathway, modeling and the current experimental results. Team member Qin Weiwei and Zhang Jiani made                         a detailed introduction of Hardware and Human Practice respectively, which has obtained a wealth                         of questions and attention from the audience. The problems raised touch on many aspects, such as                         the principle and promotion of the enzyme transformation platform, the matching of production and                         industrialization, and the safety, inspiring us to bolster and enhance our project.
Simultaneously, we want to convey our acknowledgements to South China Agricultural University and                         University of Science and Technology from their devotion into our metabolic flux modeling.
