About NPU-China Team
Hey everyone! We are NPU-China consisting of 13 students studying anything from biology, chemical engineering, electronic                         information, mathmatics, aircraft design and so on. We are a fun-loving, cell-growing, biology-doing                         group of students that've all worked very hard this year to help further research in the field of                         Acrylic acid cell factory's construciotn. We are excited to show you what all we've done, but first                         meet the NPU-China family!

Zexun Wu
Hello！I am a junior student, majoring in biotechnology. It is my second time to join iGEM, and it’s my honour being students                             leader this year. I love talking with different people as well as the teamwork to overcome every                             challenge we face! In my spare time I love swimming(I am one of the school swimming team for                             1500m and 400m freestyle) and running!

Yuan Zhang
Hello！I am a junior student, majoring in electronic information engineering and minoring in biotechnology. It is my first                             time to join iGEM, work on experiments and data processing. I really enjoy it! When one loves                             science no service seems too hard.
Chenyuan Li
I am a student of biotechnology,in charge of art design work in the team. In the latter part of the task, my workload is                             much heavier than the previous period. But compared to the students responsible for the experiment,                             I have been very relaxed. Very grateful to the players for their understanding and support. Although                             I am very lacking in my expertise and ability, I will try to do a good job. Hope to get everyone's                             advice and guidance ~

I am a Mongolian, my chinese name is Yuhan Ke. I am a junior at NPU-China majoring in mathmatics. As one of the non-bio students.                             I am learning new things in the wet lab while spending the rest of time staring at my laptop                             doing wiki pages and trying to implement the complicated model that comes with all of our many                             parts. I am one of those people who really like to code, where my free time is spent reading,                             playing game, and eating delicious food.

Bingzhao Zhuo
Biosynthesis and iGEM have brought me really a lot, which have actually become my daily routine from the construction of                             NPU-China to now. As the advisor of NPU-China this year, the growth of new staff and their advancement                             of capability enhance the efficiency of our team and also surprised me. I like the feeling of                             mutual learning and enhancement. I will accompany the team all the time and I believe that tomorrow                             is another day.
