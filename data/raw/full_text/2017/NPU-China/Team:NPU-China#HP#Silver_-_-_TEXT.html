Lecture in the school-- To spread iGEM and get more students on board with us!
December 8, 2016.
Our team arranged a recruitment talk to the students, which appealed to a mountain of students fond of                         Synthetic biology from the School of Astronautics, the school of Automation, and the School of Mechatronics                         and Engineering and so on.
Laboratory---To offer more students access to the biology laboratory!
December 11, 2016.
We organized nearly 40 students to visit our lab and introduced all sorts of instruments to them at length.                         The students are differentiated by various majors--Automation Engineering, Electronic Information                         Science and Technology, Chemistry and so on. There is no escaping the fact that students from other                         majors, constitute a large proportion of our team rather than those majoring in Biology.
Council discussion
December 20, 2016.
We had a discussion on our project's basis and innovation with leaders and teachers from our Life Science                         Academy. Meanwhile, we asked them for the project’s novelty and environmental friendliness. Leaders                         and teachers put forward the significance of innovation, inspiring us to create new things during                         the project process and create new ideas. In addition, we got suggestions on the safety and environmental                         protection during our experiments.
To familiarize more students with iGEM
June 3, 2017.
We participated in the Forum of Life Science of Shaanxi University League, where we introduced our project                         to other 4 universities in Shaanxi, including Xidian University, Northwest University, Northwest                         A&F University and Shaanxi Normal University.

Joint talks from five universities
Aguest 1, 2017.
To promote each other to carry out the tasks we faced----communication and cooperation. During the summer's                         intense experimental mission, four members of our team went to Tianjin to exchange their views                         with four other college teams that participated in this year's iGEM competition.
Visit the factory
Aguest 4, 2017.
To narrow the gap between the lab and the factory, we asked entrepreneurs for ideas about how to innovatively                         and feasibly design our project, and they suggested that biosafety of our project should be more emphasized.                         In August 2017, under the leadership of our teacher, some of our NPU-CHINA team members paid a visit to Xi'an Aerospace                         Sanwo Chemical Co., Ltd based on the theme of "Acrylic Application and Sustainable                         Development". During the communication, we explained the concept of synthetic biology to the entrepreneurs. Meanwhile,                         they advised that we could also show the biosafety of our project.
Communication——CCiC
Aguest 26, 2017.
On 28th August this year, the 4th CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community) was successfully held in Fujian                         Agriculture and Forestry University (FAFU), Jinshan campus. Nearly 50 iGEM college teams and high school                         teams from all over the country , non-participating teams and special guests and scholars working                         on synthetic biology related areas all gathered in FAFU Conference Center, having a wonderful                         talk about exchanges and sharing.
