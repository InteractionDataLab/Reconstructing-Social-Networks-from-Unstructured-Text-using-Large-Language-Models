Our best basic part, ceaS2
CEAS, which is N2- (2-carboxyethyl) arginine synthase, is an enzyme in Streptomyces clavuligerus, EC                         2.5.1.66. CEAS is a TPP-related enzyme, can catalyze the condensation of D-G3P and L-Arg with the                         involvement of TPP and magnesium ions (thiamine pyrophosphate) to produce N2- (2-carboxyethyl) arginine,                         which will continue to participate in the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid as the first intermediate.
According to the earlier literature, CEAS (N2-(2-carboxyethyl) arginine synthase) was a synergistic                         effect of Ceas1 and Ceas, namely, N2- (2-carboxyethyl) arginine came from the condensation of G3P                         and L-Arg, which was catalyzed by Ceas1 and Ceas2. The process would be accompanied by the formation                         of acrylic acid[1]. But with the deepening of the study, Matthew E.C. Caines found that Ceas2 played                         the main role in the catalytic process. And they speculated the catalytic mechanism of Ceas2, as                         shown below [2].
How we use these basic parts?

We designed a GDC (GlyDH-DAK-Ceas2) pathway that could produce acrylic acid using glycerol. In this pathway,                      GlyDH (Glycerol dehydrogenase，BBa_K2347001) can efficiently convert glycerol to DHA (1,3-Dihydroxyacetone), and                      then DAK（Dihydroxyacetone kinase，BBa_K2347002） enzyme can phosphorylate  DHA to DHAP, and then the ceaS2 Enzyme                      BBa_K2347000）can make it into acrylic acid.
In addition, since GlyDH is  NAD + dependent,  in order to increase the supply of reducing force, we also                      added the NOX (NADH dehydrogenase, BBa_K2347003) and CAT (Catalase, BBa_K2347004) to this pathway, providing                      the reduction force for GlyDH through two layers of substrate.  Finally, we created the new combination of GNCDC                      (GlyDH-NOX-CAT-DAK-ceaS2) pathway using five enzymes from BBa_K2347000 to BBa_K2347004 to produce acrylic acid.
