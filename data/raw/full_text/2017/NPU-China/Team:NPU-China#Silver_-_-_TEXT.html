Lecture in the school-- To spread iGEM and get more students on board with us!
December 8, 2016.
Our team arranged a recruitment talk to the students, which appealed to a mountain of students fond of                         Synthetic biology from the School of Astronautics, the school of Automation, and the School of Mechatronics                         and Engineering and so on.
Laboratory---To offer more students access to the biology laboratory!
December 11, 2016.
We organized nearly 40 students to visit our lab and introduce all sorts of instruments to them at length.                         The students are differentiated by various majors--Automation Engineering, Electronic Information                         Science and Technology, Physics, Chemistry and so on. There is no escaping the fact that                         students from other majors constitute a large proportion                         of our team rather than those majoring in Biology, and their strong interest in biology accounts                         for their choice of joining us and ceaselessly brought surprise to the team utilizing their expertise,                         like our Hardware this year.
Communication---To make us more disciplined and efficient
December 20, 2016.
We had a tea party with the teachers from the School of Life Sciences, during which we expanded upon                         our project and schedule. Valuable comments have also been acquired from the teachers and they advised                         us to abide by the team regulations, which definitely culminate in the amounting efficiency of our                         experiments.
To familiarize more students with iGEM
June 3, 2017.
We participated in the Forum on Life Science of Shaanxi University League, where we introduced our project                         to other 4 universities in Shaanxi, including Xidian University, Northwest University, Northwest                         A&F University and Shaanxi Normal University.
