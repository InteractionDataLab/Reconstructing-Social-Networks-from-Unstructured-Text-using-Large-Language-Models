                        from the chemical synthesis goods. However, the environmental pollution and energy crises have also
                        forced people to find new solutions. Synthetic biology instructs us that we can introduce new chemical

                                        The first step of two-step oxidation of acrylic acid is propylene reacts with oxygen, producing acrolein. And then, acrolein
                                        reacts with oxygen, producing acrylic acid. The conversion rate is up to 90%. Chemical
                                        Formula (1) and (2) are showed below. This method is widely used in industry production

                                         The process of the oxidation method of the propylene is mentioned in the patent
                                        of the Japanese Catalyst Company in the 1880s. The reaction temperature of the first
                                        step is 320-330℃. If other additives such as W, Co, K, Si and O are added to the
                                        catalyst MoBiFe, the yield of acrolein can reach more than 90%. The reaction
                                        temperature of the second step is 210-255 ℃. The compositions of the catalyst are
                                        Mo, Bi, Fe, Co, K and O. The yield of acrylic acid can reach 97.5%. The yield
                                        of acrylic acid in the two-step oxidation process is much higher than that of the
                                        direct oxidation of propylene to produce acrylic acid. This is because the reaction
                                        temperature in the one-step process is 325-350 ° C, at which the conversion of propylene
                                        to acrolein is high. But acrolein and acrylic acid are further oxidized at that temperature. Therefore, to obtain higher yields of acrylic acid, control the reaction at
                                        different stages by controlling the temperature and changing the catalyst composition
                                        in the two-step method is more reasonable and more valuable. As the most widely used
                                        method in the industrial production of acrylic acid, oxidation of propylene has the
                                        advantages: high conversion efficiency and simple production process.

                        production of acrylic acid
                         Although this practice has many advantages, but the raw material depends heavily on the traditional

                        Therefore, it is imperative to develop renewable energy alternative to replace fossil energy to produce
                        acrylic acid in a greener way.

                                        So far, the researchers have found that certain microorganisms which contain nitrilase can catalyze the conversion of acrylonitrile
                                        to acrylic acid. Nitrilase can catalyze the nitrile compound directly to produce

                                        Just as its name implies, lactic acid dehydration pathway refers to a metabolic pathway using the dehydration of lactic acid
                                        to produce acrylic acid. Because the fermentation production process of lactic acid
                                        is very mature, so using the dehydration of lactic acid to produce acrylic acid has
                                        long been aroused the interest of the researchers.
                                        At present, the method mainly uses Clostridium propionicum as the starting strain.
                                        Specific metabolic pathway is shown in the following picture. Although the route is short,
                                        but there are still many problems when used in producing acrylic acid.
                                        As can be seen from the picture, metabolism of lactic acid is divided into the left
                                        side, the oxidation pathway and the right side, the reduction pathway. When Clostridium
                                        propionate uses lactic acid as a source of energy, one molecule of lactic acid produces
                                        one third of the molecule of acetic acid and 2/3 of the propionic acid. In the
                                        production process of acetic acid, there will be four electrons and 4 protons generate,
                                        as well as offering ATP for bacteria to grow. The acryloyl CoA in the reduction pathway
                                        receives electrons to produce propionyl CoA and finally generates propionic acid.

                                        Propionic acid oxidation pathway refers to Clostridium propionate use propionic acid as a substrate to produce acrylic acid
                                        under the aerobic conditions. It is speculated that Propionic acid oxidation pathway
                                        is the reverse pathways from lactic acid to propionic acid in Clostridium propionate,
                                        namely propionic acid to propionyl CoA, and then to acryloyl CoA , finally converted
                                        to acrylic acid. Propionic acid oxidation pathway has the same problem as lactate
                                        dehydration pathways, that is, need to add exogenous electron acceptor to achieve
                                        coenzyme regeneration, so that the entire cell system remained stable.

                                        Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is a sulfur metabolite synthesized in some higher plants in sea water, algae and marine
                                        microalgae. Some marine organisms such as bacteria, phytoplankton have DMSP
                                        lyase, which cleaves the DMSP into acrylate and dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which
                                        is also commonly found in Alcaligines faecalis, The route is shown in Figure 1.3.
                                        Extracellular DMSP is transported into the body by the carrier protein, be cleaved
                                        into acrylic acid and DMS by DMSP lyase. Acrylic acid is further reacted to form
                                        β-HP.
                                        The DMSP pathway is the only biological pathway that can directly produce acrylic
                                        acid. The DMSP lyase is the key enzymes, but it is not clear at present that there
                                        is no definite sequence of its genes. Therefore, research report about making use
                                        of or modifying DMSP pathway is rarely seen.

                        pathway , obscuration of the synthesis mechanism and low efficiency of the synthesis. How to build
                        a short and efficient acrylic acid biosynthetic pathway to achieve a highly efficient acrylic biosynthetic
                        factory is the very key to success! And this is also the entry point of our project this year.
                        <H3 style="text-align:center">Why we choose Glycerol as cabon source？</H3><H4>Glycerol is a simple polyol compound, which presents as viscous liquid at the room temperature. It is
                        colorless, tasteless and non-toxic. Glycerol is a by-product of the biodiesel manufacturing industry,
                        which once was a relatively scarce chemical raw material. With the rapid development of bio-diesel
                        manufacturing industry in recent years, the substantial increase of glycerol production has led to
                        the significantly lower price. Therefore, the use of glycerol as a raw material for microbial cell
                        factory to produce bulk chemicals has the advantage of being cheap and green, while it also allays
                        the pressure of dealing with the by-products waste in the production of biodiesel. In addition, compared
                        with glucose, xylose and other carbohydrate substrates, glycerol metabolism can produce higher reducing
                        power, making it the ideal carbon source for the fermentation synthesis in cell factory.
