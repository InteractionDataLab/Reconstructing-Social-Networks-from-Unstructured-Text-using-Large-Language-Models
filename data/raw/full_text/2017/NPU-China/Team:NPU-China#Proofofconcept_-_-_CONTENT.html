                        expression of ceaS2 protein by IPTG. Harnessing the His protein tag from the pET-28a plasmid skeleton,
                        we used the affinity chromatography nickel column to separate and purify the ceaS2 protein and identified
                        it by 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The results were as follows:</H4><H4> Purified ceaS2 after Ni-NTA affinity chromatography
                         (M, protein marker (from top to bottom is 25、35、48、63、75、100、135、180 kDa);Lane1, precipitation samples
                        in the cell lysates; 2, supernatant samples in the cell lysates; 3, supernatant flow through Ni-NTA
                        affinity chromatography; 4, 50 mM imidazole eluent; 5, 100 mM imidazole eluent; 6, 200 mM imidazole
                        eluent; 7, 300 mM imidazole eluent)
                         According to the information in the Uniprot database, the ceaS2 protein has 573 amino acids and
                        the molecular weight of the protein is 62.34 kDa. In Figure, electrophoretic display of recombinant
                        protein molecular weight is consistent with the theoretical molecular weight of the protein, which
                        leads to the conclusion that this is the expression of our target protein. The results show that
                        ceaS2 has good expression and high purity after Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.
                        </H4><H3>1.3 ceaS2 enzymatic reaction:</H3><H4>In order to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the experiment, we first examined the concentration
                        of the purified protein. Proteins were quantified using the Thermol Scientific BCA Protein Quantification
                        Kit. The standardized curve of protein concentration of OD562 interval measured.
                    </H4><H4><CENTER>Standardized curve of protein concentration</CENTER> The purified and quantified protein was used for enzymatic activity reaction. The control group
                        was not add ceaS2 enzyme, and the protein buffer was used to make up the volume. The reaction system
                        was mixed and reacted at 30 ° C for 10 h.
                    </H4><H3> 1.4 Determination of Acrylic Acid by Liquid Chromatography</H3><H4>
                      We used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the reaction solution. Determination conditions and parameters:
                        87H chromatographic column, 5 mM H2SO4 mobile phase, flow rate 0.6 mL / min, UV absorbance 210 nm.
                        Figure for the liquid phase determination results.
                    </H4><H4><CENTER>Identification function of ceaS2 by liquid chromatogram</CENTER> （The black line is acrylic acid standard, green line is control, blue line is reaction of D-G3P
                        as substrate, red line is reaction DHAP as substrate）
                         The liquid chromatogram results show that the acrylic acid standardized peak time was in 19.304
                        minutes presenting a single and satisfying peak shape. The samples in the control group did not correspond
                        with the treatment group. D-G3P and DHAP reaction group samples both had peaks, in line with the
                        standard sample of acrylic acid. Therefore, we can initially determine that ceas2 is able to catalyze
                        D-G3P and DHAP to generate acrylic acid.
                    </H4><H3>1.5 Determination of Acrylic Acid by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)</H3><H4>
                        For the reliable and persuasive results, we also carried out the determination of LC-MS samples. The results are shown below.
                        </H4><H4><CENTER>LC-MS of ceaS2 generated acrylic acid</CENTER> （From top to bottom is acrylic acid standard, control, ceas2 reaction by DHAP as substrate, secondary
                        mass spectrum of acrylic acid）
                         According to the liquid chromatogram, the control group had no peaks, and the retention time
                        and molecular weight of the sample group were consistent with the standard sample of acrylic acid.
                        Also, the molecular ion peaks and fragment ion peaks in the secondary mass spectrum of the sample
                        also fully demonstrated that ceas2 catalyzed DHAP or ceaS2 to produce the acrylic acid.
                        </H4><H2>2. GAACF 1.0: de novo synthesis of acrylic acid</H2><H3>2.1 A New Approach to Acrylic Biosynthesis</H3><H4> G3P are common secondary products of the E. coli central metabolic pathway. By introducing the ceaS2
                        enzyme directly into the chassis cells, we can construct a new pathway of acrylic biosynthesis based
                        on any carbon source. DHAP and G3P are the carbon flow nodes that E. coli glycerol metabolic pathway
                        must pass through, according to which we designed a new approach to acrylic acid biosynthesis based
                        on glycerol.
                         The new pathway, as shown below
                    </H4><H4><CENTER>The acrylic biosynthetic pathway based on E. coli glycerol aerobic metabolic pathway</CENTER> This new approach is the shortest compared to other known acrylic pathways, where only three enzymes
                        are needed to achieve the synthesis of acrylic acid from glycerol, so this pathway not merely has
                        a better malleability, but also a more promising development prospect.
                    </H4><H3> 2.2 Realization of de novo synthesis of acrylic acid</H3><H4> We use the whole cell catalytic method to verify whether the new pathway works in E.coli. After
                        inducing the expression of ceaS2 enzyme in E. coli, the reaction system was prepared and carried
                        out. The reaction solution was filtered and the acrylic acid content was determined by high performance
                        liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results are as follows:<CENTER>Primitive peak figure of liquid phase, with standard control sample. Shown as follows</CENTER><CENTER> Whole Cell Catalytic Acrylic de novo Synthesis of Liquid Chromatography</CENTER> From the peak chromatogram, it can be seen that the goal of de novo synthesis of acrylic acid from
                        the cells have been realized.
                         We have achieved the prototype of the glycerol-based acrylic cell factory based on the E. coli BL21
                        (DE3) strain as the chassis cell.
