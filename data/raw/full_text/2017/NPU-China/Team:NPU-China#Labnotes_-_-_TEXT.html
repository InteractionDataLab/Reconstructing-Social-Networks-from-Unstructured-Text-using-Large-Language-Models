We have compiled an account of everything that has happened in the lab over the summer. We are excited to show                     you how busy we have been in iGEM 2017! We believe that sharing our work flow will convey the passion and dedication                     of iGEM students all around the world, as we continuously push our limits to achieve high quality results.
