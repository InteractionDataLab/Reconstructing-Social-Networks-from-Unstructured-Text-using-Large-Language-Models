Content
Basic content, here texts are written.              General rules:             if html tags (the things starting with "<" and ending with ">") occur, the whole block in which they occur, have to be inside the following (replacing 'content')                               content                           Pages on the wiki can be edited or created by going the URL where the page shall be and choosing               wiki tools -> Edit/Create              Simply paste the text there and save the page.               Images can be uploaded by choosing 'upload files' under 'wiki tools'.             Filenames shall be               T--Heidelberg--Team_Heidelberg_2017_real-name.png              If a file was uploaded, a page showing the file occurs, click on 'original file' and take the URL you are getting to. This URL is the image URL used to embed the image.              An editor that matches braces is pretty useful. Check if the braces of main are close properly and the chances are good thta the page will work
