Demonstrate
Our project works
In vivo Evolution
Demonstration of our PREDCEL Toolbox:
Cytochrome engineering
We engineered the product specificity of cytochrome P450 1A2 using PREDCEL.
Protein Interaction
We used PREDCEL to evolve a split T7 polymerase towards improved auto-reassembly.
Optogenetics
We used light to control selection stringency during PREDCEL
In silico Evolution
Demonstration of our AiGEM Software:
Evolution of \(\beta\)-Lactamases
We observed a correlation of the measured \(\beta\)-lactamase activities with the protein label scores from AiGEM
Reprogramming of \(\beta\)-Glucoronidase
We used AiGEM to inform the design of a \(\beta\)-glucoronidase mutant with near-wildtype \(\beta\)-galactosidase activity.
Organosilicons
Demonstration of Carbon-Silicon-Bond formation:
Organosilicons
We used an engineered cytochrome to catalyze carbon-silicon bond formation in whole-cell extracts.
