Mutation rate estimation
Theory behind this model
The flow rate through the lagoons \(\Phi_{L}\) and the number of generations \(N_{G}\) are redudant. In the calculation, \(\Phi_{L}\) is prioritised, so set it to zero to use the number of generations for the calculation.
Consider \(L_{S}\) as the number of basepairs that is expected to be mutated. If a part of the sequence you are interested in, is highly conserved choose a lower \(L_{S}\).
Parameter Overview

Get your probabilities
Mutation rate \(r_{M} \:[bp/generation]\)
Flow rate Lagoon \(\Phi_{L} \: [Volumes/h]\)
Total time in lagoon \(t \: [h]\)
Number of generations  \(N_{g}\)
Length of sequence that can mutate \(L_{S} \: [bp]\)
Number of sequences that are sequenced \(N_{S}\)
Probability to get at least one mutated result  \(p(N_{M}>0) \)
Calculate
\(p_{m} =\) % (bp/bp).\(N_{M} =\) bp per sequence.The share of sequences that shows at least one mutation in \(L_{S}\) bp is \(p_{M}=\) % of sequences
