Notebook Database
Lab Documentation step by step
This notebook database downloads the tables chosen below. Because of our hardworking lab team, some of the tables are extraordinary large. Don't worry, theyre downloaded as compressed files and none is larger than 400 KB. But decompressing inflates them to up to 7 MB, showing them can take a while.
Competent Cells
Agarose Gels
Assemblies
Assembly Products
Cultures
Cycler Runs
Enzymes
Golden Gate
Ligations
Markers
PCR Products
PCRs
Plasmids
Plates
Primers
Purifications
Restrictions
Glycerol Stocks
Strains
Transformations
Every Restriction digest and PCR product that is run on an agarose gel is documented in this sheet. Every single lane is assigned its own ID. The result of the Gel can be documented here.
Every CPEC or Gibson Assembly reaction is documented in this sheet. Based on the information in about the resulting product in the assembly products sheet, detailed pipetting instructions are calculated.
Every CPEC or Gibson Assembly is documented here on a theoretical (sequence) level and is assigned an ID. The plasmid ID of the product and the purification IDs of the educts are required as input.
Every batch of competent cells is documented in this sheet and gets an ID.
Every bacterial culture is documented in this sheet and is asigned an ID.
Every cycler run is documented in this sheed and gets an ID.
For some reason some enzymes are documented in this sheet. Interestingly, they do NOT get a numerical ID
Every Golden Gate reaction is documented in this sheet. The resulting plasmid ID, the purification IDs of the educts and choosable reaction parameters are required as input. Detailed pipetting instructions are calculated.
Every Ligation reaction is documented in this sheet. The resulting plasmid ID, the purification IDs of the educts and choosable reaction parameters are required as input. Detailed pipetting instructions are calculated.
Rather useless sheet.
Every PCR product, defined by source sequence and Primer sequences is documented here on a theoretical (sequence) level and is assigned an ID. As a valuable control, the product sequence and recommended annealing temperature is calculated by this sheet.
Every PCR reaction is documented in this sheet. Detailed pipetting instructions are calculated based on standard protocols.
The sequence and name of every plasmid is assigned an ID by this sheet. Important: This is not the ID of a physical tube containing this plasmid.
Every LB-Agar plate that that was used for growth of colonies is documented in this sheed. As always, an ID is assigned.
The sequences and names (Unfortunately, the names are IDs. This is a bad idea) of all oligos are assigned an ID.
This sheet contains information about all DNA purifications from any source. The IDs assigned in this sheet reflect actual physical samples stored in the freezer.
Restriction digests are documented in this sheet.
Glycerol stocks are documented in this sheet and assigned an ID
E. coli strains are documented in this sheet and assigned an ID.
Transformations of either purified DNA, ligations, assemblies or Golden Gate reactions in competent E. coli cells are documented in this sheet.
