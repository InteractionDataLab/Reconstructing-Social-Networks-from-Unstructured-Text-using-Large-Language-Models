The essence of our work
We learned a lot, found new friends and had great fun over the summer. In addition, we...
Introduced a unique in vivo and in silico directed evolution interface as novel engineering paradigm to synthetic biology.
Developed PREDCEL, as simple, cheap and easy-to-implement PACE alternative.
Outlined a unique workflow for in vivo enzyme evolution based on computationally predicted riboswitches.
First iGEM team to use an engineered cytochrome to catalyze carbon-silicon bond formation in whole cell extracts.
Successfully integrated the feedback of experts and the broader public into our project design at diverse layers.
Frist iGEM team to apply deep learning to protein engineering.
Created and validated AiGEM, an intelligent software for generating protein functionality de novo.
Implemented SafetyNET to safeguard directed evolution experiments.

Bronze
Find a comprehensive compilation of sponsors, partners and scientific contributors on our Attributions page
We submitted 94 parts as part of our PREDCEL/PACE toolbox with the necessary documentation.
Find our results for the InterLab Measurement Study
We complied with all requirements and regulations set by the iGEM competition
We had a great summer and are very much looking forward to meet you at the Giant Jamboree
Silver
We experimentally validated that our BioBricks (e.g. BBa_K2398019 , BBa_K2398555 and BBa_K2398557 ) work as expected! Visit our toolbox collection for more than 90 parts
We collaborated with other iGEM teams from all over the world in a bi-directional and significant way. We initiated our own Heidelberg Interlab Study to validate our Mutagenesis Plasmids.
We critically thought about the impact of our project on society, environment and safety. To this end, we engaged with the public, experts and pupils.
Gold
We extended the Engineering Cycle for Foundational Advance projects by including sophisticated concepts for safety measures and the responsible use of new technologies.
We improved the function of an existing biobrick by calculated improved beta-lactamase variants in silico and evaluating the superior functionality in the wet lab.
We intensively modeled our PREDCEL experiments and provide web-based interactive tools that enable our users to model their own systems!
We developed PREDCEL as easy-to-handle and cheap PACE alternative. We demonstrate the feasibility of our technology by several applications including CYP1A2.
