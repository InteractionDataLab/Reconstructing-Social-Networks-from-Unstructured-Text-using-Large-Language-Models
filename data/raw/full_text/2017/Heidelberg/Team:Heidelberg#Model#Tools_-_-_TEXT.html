Modeling
Interactive tools
Interactive: Glucose Concentration
Model the glucose concentration to make sure mutagenesis plasmids are sufficiently induced to get optimal mutagenesis conditions for both PREDCEL and PACE.
Go Interactive
Interactive: Arabinose Concentration
Model the Arabinose concentration to make sure mutagenesis plasmids are sufficiently induced to get optimal mutagenesis conditions for both PREDCEL and PACE.
Go Interactive
Interactive: Mutation Rate Estimation
Estimate the number of mutated sequences in a PREDCEL or PACE experiment at a given point in time to check for the covered sequence space and to save time and money when sequencing.
Go Interactive
Interactive: Medium Consumption
Calculate the amount of medium needed for a PACE experiment, see how medium consumption can be reduced when experimental parameters are optimized.
Go Interactive
Interactive: Lagoon Contamination
Check if lagoons are vulnerable to contamination by microorganisms under given experimental conditions.
Go Interactive
Characterwise Diff-tool
Mark the differences in two aligned strings, case sensitive if needed.
