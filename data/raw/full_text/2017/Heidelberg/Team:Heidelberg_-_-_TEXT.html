Life shows an astonishing diversity and complexity, resulting from millions of years of random mutation and selection.
We, the iGEM Team Heidelberg ,
Accelerate Evolution
to drive Innovation for human benefit

Curious how?
To speed up and direct evolution, we use phage-assisted continuous evolution and our newly created & simple method called PREDCEL

No way to be fast enough without
Modeling
Learn how we optimized our experimental parameters using ODE models calibrated with wet lab data.
And the best: Our interactive models run entirely in your browser!
Still too slow? Meet our Artificial Intelligence for Genetic Evolution Mimicking,
AiGEM!
AiGEM comprises a deep neuronal network and accompanying genetic algorithm able to fast-forward directed evolution in silico

To make a difference, we need to consider the whole
Colorful Picture
Our integrated human practice activities helped us to make our technology safer and stimulate its responsible use , ideally to address urgent human needs.
Our Applications:
Evolving novel cytochromes with help of in silico predicted riboswitches , to enable fully biological production of organosilicons . Using PREDCEL, we engineered the product specificity of cytochrome P450 1A2 towards theophylline.
Now it’s on you. Our toolbox guide and RFC help you to get started.
Learn. Evolve. PREDCEL!
