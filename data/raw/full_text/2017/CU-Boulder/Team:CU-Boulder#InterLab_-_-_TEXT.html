Interlab
• InterLab •
This year our team decided to participate in the 2017 Interlab study, a multi-lab study in standardization for instrument measurements. More information can be found at the 2017 iGEM Website . Our interlab notebook can be found at here . Our instrument was a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader.
Many thanks to the Detweiler and Junge labs here at CU for providing some materials and equipment access without which we would not have been able to perform this protocol, and to our mentor Dr. Brian DeDecker for training on the plate reader.

• LUDOX & Standardization •
For these we required no deviations from the standard protocol. A small amount of pipetting error seems to have been present in the fluorescein measurements. We hope to minimize this in the cell protocol by using reverse pipetting. We believe our standard curves were linear enough to not require repeating, however.

Some changes were required to the protocol. We needed to use two sets of plates (clear and black-bottom) in order to get accurate measurements from our plate reader. Interestingly or unfortunately, our test device 3 did not seem to produce fluorescence. We are not sure if this is due to a malfunction of the part, but our plates certainly had resistance and there should have been no possibility of DNA contamination during transformation, so we are confident that these results are at least not a result of any simple mistake.
