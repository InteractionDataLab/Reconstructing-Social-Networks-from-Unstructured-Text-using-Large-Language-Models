Maxwell Saal
Class of 2017
Majors?
Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology, Biochemistry
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
I'm not much of a romantic, I guess. I'm content to be wherever I am, so long as there's good food, interesting things to do, and good people to be around. In that order, probably.
What got you interested in your program/major?
There are a lot of things that interest me. I love books, and the arts generally, and I've consumed a great deal of history in pursuit of answering whether we as society are really getting anywhere (side note: if we are, it's nowhere fast). But while humanities are fun, well.. learning how a set of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen atoms come together to produce complex new structures which get taken apart and put together all by doing nothing but taking advantage of laws of the universe.. it lights a different kind of fire.
A random fact about yourself?
I own a lot of nice socks.

Class of 2018
Majors?
Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology, Neurobiology
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
I would be riding my bike, skiing, or snuggling with my dog... But on a more serious note, I would         love to break stigma regarding mental health. My goal is to develop better drugs for depression, anxiety disorder, etc.         I could also see myself working for a suicide prevention/mental health awareness nonprofit.
What got you interested in your program/major?
The complexity of the brain is SO COOL. There are endless avenues for exploration and discovery.
A random fact about yourself?
I can eat more than you...
Andres Lau
Class of 2019
Majors?
Chemical & Biological Engineering
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
I would want to be an MMA fighter
What got you interested in your program/major?
I got interested in chemical and biological engineering because I thought I wanted to be a doctor, but then realized that I was more interested in making the medicine than prescribing the medicine. I wanted to become a pharmaceutical engineer because the world needs cures for countless diseases and I want to be a part of that.
A random fact about yourself?
I’m undefeated in Muay Thai and I’m in love with Simon
Su Sie Park
Class of 2018
Majors?
Chemical and Biological Engineering
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
I would like to be teaching children in rural area, or volunteering in 3rd world country during the day, and spending the weekends baking, cooking, and gardening.
What got you interested in your program/major?
A random fact about yourself?
I was born in Seoul South Korea, Finished my middle school and high school in the Philippines, and on my way to complete my college career in US.
Simon Kalmus
Class of 2019
Majors?
Chemical & Biological Engineering
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
Honestly, I'd probably still be tinkering away in the lab. Maybe a little bit of gardening and  back country camping to keep myself sane...
What got you interested in your program/major?
I had always been fascinated by complex systems and their behavior. This interest was accentuated by the interaction networks observed in cellular biology. Thinking about the potential applications of modern biotechnology is absolutely exhilarating!
A random fact about yourself?
Much to my mother's dismay... I hitchhiked from Colorado to California and back when I was 17 years old.
Madison Adamthwaite
Class of 2019
Majors?
Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
If I could be doing anything at this moment I would want to be on top of a mountain, enjoying the view, and eating a peanut butter sandwich.
What got you interested in your program/major?
I became interested in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology because I thought cell models/drawings looked pretty and interesting.
A random fact about yourself?
I have played piano for 15 years.
Suchita Lulla
Class of 2020
Majors?
Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology, Computer Science
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
If I could do anything I would probably be painting.
What got you interested in your program/major?
I got into MCDB because I read a book called Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters by Matt Ridley, and it hooked me on genetics. I got into Comp Sci because I had an amazing teacher in high school who made computer science fun and encouraged us to learn on our own.
A random fact about yourself?
I play violin and guitar.
Nathaniel Moore
Class of 2019
Majors?
Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology, Biochemistry
If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
I'd be skiing.
What got you interested in your program/major?
I just always loved biology, it's the coolest science out there.
A random fact about yourself?
I've never lived with any sort of pet before!

If you could be doing whatever your heart desired, what would it be?
I would like to travel to Italy and cook for a month. I love making pizza and all Italian food.
What got you interested in your program/major?
I had taken a Biotechnology in high school and failed terribly when I tried to make E. Coli glow. After that I rarely left the lab and now I want to engineer bacteria to create novel chemicals. Chemical and Biological Engineering looked like a good choice for me.
A random fact about yourself?
I like to play Dungeons & Dragons
