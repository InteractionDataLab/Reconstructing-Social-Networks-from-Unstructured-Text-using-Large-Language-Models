BBa_K2249001
This part is a fluorescent protein tagged with two peptide sequences: first, a EutC 1-19 tag that causes it to be sequestered inside EutS compartments (formed with BBa_K2129001 made by CU-Boulder 2016 team). Additionally it has a LVA protein degradation tag. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed that this tag causes degradation of the protein without EutS compartment expression, but does not degrade the fluorescent proteins inside the formed compartments.
BBa_K2249001
BBa_K2249000 with a luciferase fusion, with an HA tag added for purification purposes. We did not end up using this for data collection, but hypothetically it would have been used for an assay where the isolated compartments would have opened up in media containing luciferin, to see if the compartments functioned as an isolator and could be opened with light.
