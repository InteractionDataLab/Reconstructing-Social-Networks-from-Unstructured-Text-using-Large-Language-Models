Interlab
• InterLab •
This year our team decided to participate in the 2017 Interlab study, a multi-lab study in standardization for instrument measurements. More information can be found at the 2017 iGEM Website . Our interlab notebook can be found at here . Our instrument was a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader.
Many thanks to the Detweiler and Junge labs here at CU for providing some materials and equipment access without which we would not have been able to perform this protocol, and to our mentor Dr. Brian DeDecker for training on the plate reader.
