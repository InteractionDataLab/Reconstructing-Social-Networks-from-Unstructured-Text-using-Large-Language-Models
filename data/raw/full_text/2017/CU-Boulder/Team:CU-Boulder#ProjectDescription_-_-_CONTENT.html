Bacterial microcompartments are subcellular structures within microorganisms that function to either sequester harmful metabolic intermediates or concentrate critical substrates (1). Ethanolamine utilization (Eut) compartments are a form of subcellular microcompartment used by bacteria in order to sequester harmful intermediates of ethanolamine metabolism (1). These proteinaceous structures are formed from a series of structural proteins that have been named Eut S, M, N, L, and K (2). Research has shown that ectopic expression of the EutS protein from Salmonella enterica is sufficient to form microcompartments in Escherichia coli (3). Thus we sought to repurpose the EutS microcompartment system as a next-generation drug delivery mecchanism. 

In nature, the catalytic enzymes responsible for ethanolamine metabolism are localized and attached to EutS inside the microcompartment. The ethanolamine ammonia lyase, EutC, is incorporated inside EutS microcompartments through a targeting sequence contained within the first 19 amino acids (EutC1-19) (3) .Therefore, we can conceivably fuse EutC1-19 to any protein for incorporation in EutS microcompartments. Initially, our team proved this concept by fusing EutC1-19 to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EutC1-19-EGFP) and co-expressing EutC1-19-EGFP together with EutS resulting in the formation of green fluorescing microcompartments.

In order to give us remote control over the assembly and disassembly of our compartments, our team utilized the photoconvertible, non-canonical amino acid AzoBenzene. Azobenzene has been shown to undergo a steric shift from cis to trans under the stimulation of light at the wavelength of ~360 nm (6). We reasoned that if Azobenzene was substituted for residues that were critical for EutS oligomerization, then the photoconversion of Azobenzene from a cis- to trans-conformation would destabilize the microcompartment leading to cargo release. Using PyMOL to model EutS oligomers, we identified residues positioned along different protein-protein interfaces to substitute the Azobenzene group with the purpose of disrupting these interfaces when the Azobenzene is in a trans-conformation after exposure to ~360 nm light. We are able to precisely control the insertion of Azobenzene into EutS by mutating the target residue to an amber stop codon coupled with the exogenous expression of a modified tRNA transferase, which can recognize both the amber stop codon and Azobenzene (5).

In order to investigate the efficiency of our various point mutations, we cloned EutC1-19-FusionRed-LVA to be used as out reporter cargo. The LVA tag targets our cargo protein for degradation by cytosolic proteases. This ensures that any cargo not protected by microcompartments would be destroyed. Therefore, if Azobenzene has been inserted in a position that is critical to microcompartment stability, then stimulation of E. coli with 360 nm wavelength should lead to cargo release from microcompartments followed by cargo degradation and a decrease in red fluorescence. Confirmation of this mechanism was performed via fluorescent microscopy. 

The group also attached the fluorescent protein luciferase to the inside of our microcompartments. With the presence of its substrate molecule luciferin, luciferase will produce light. We placed isolated BMCs in solution with luciferin. Since the luciferase is unable to cross the BMC, there should be no luciferase activity. However, upon stimulation and disassembly of the microcompartments, the luciferin is now able to interact with the luciferase cargo. These results were confirmed via fluorescent microscopy.

Continuing our work with cargo modularity, the group attached the small protein Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF[Alpha]) to our EutS protein. TNF[Alpha] is a small signalling molecule that acts in mammalian populations to signal apoptosis. It is highly cytotoxic, therefore cell-specific targeting is vital to its potential use as a drug. By attaching TNF[Alpha] to the inside of our microcompartments, we could potentially control the locality of drug release, limiting the negative side effects of the drug outside of the location where it would be needed.
