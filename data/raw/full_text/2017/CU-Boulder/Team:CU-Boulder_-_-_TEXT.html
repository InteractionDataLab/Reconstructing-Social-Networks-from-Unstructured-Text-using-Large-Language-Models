Bacterial microcompartments are subcellular structures naturally produced by certain microbial populations...
These compartments act in nature to either localize and concentrate substrates, or to sequester harmful metabolic intermediates...
Our group has designed recombinant compartments in order to achieve remote control over the rapid assembly and dissasembly of the structures...
Using this method... Our compartments could potentially act as next-generation drug delivery systems, biosensors, or as a solution to sequester diffuse and harmful environmental toxins. Continue to our project description to learn more...
