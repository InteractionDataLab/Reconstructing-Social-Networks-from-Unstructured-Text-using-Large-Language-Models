Basic Part
To developed pHF10, we used the Santangelo lab derived pLC71  as a chassis and used restriction enzymes and ligation techniques to insert the limonene synthase gene. For submission of a new part. our plans were to use a similar technique as the one used for the plasmid, except with pSB1C3. However, we had difficulty removing the limonene synthase gene from pHF10. This may be due to how we inserted it into the plasmid originally, or a complication from switiching plasmids.
