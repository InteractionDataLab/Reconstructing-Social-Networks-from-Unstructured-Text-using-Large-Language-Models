Extraction for GC:
Synechocystis 2 mL aliquot extraction (Bligh & Dyer) 1 Last updated: 10/07/14 YE
Notes: This protocol was developed for 2 mL aliquots pulled from Synechocystis grown in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Procedure:
Thaw 2 mL frozen aliquot from -80 o C.
Add 200 µL of acetic acid. Vortex 10 sec.
Add 5 µL of 4g/L C15:0 FFA. Vortex 10 sec (use RPT plastic pipet tips).
Add 7.50mL of 1:2 CHCl 3 :MeOH. Vortex 10 sec.
Add 2.50mL of CHCl 3 . Vortex 10 sec.)
Add 2.50mL of HPLC H 2 O. Vortex 10 sec.
Leave in fume hood at room temperature overnight.
Pipet out bottom layer with a Pasteur pipette into 4mL glass tube with septum. (Recover ~80% of it. <5mL)
Evaporate all solvents under nitrogen (~1hr). Make sure samples are absolutely dry.
Resuspend samples in 300 µL Hexane (HPLC grade).
With a glass pipet, aliquot all samples into GC vials. Run sample on GC.
Store injected samples in -20 o C. They can be derivatized to FAME for analysis.
Notes:
The ideal solvent ratio (chloroform:Methanol:Water) before dilution (at step 4) is 1:2:0.8. The solvent ratio after dilution should be 2:2:1.8 (at step 6, after vortexing). After addition of solvent at step 5, there should be phase separation in the tube (top: organic layer, bottom: solvent layer). If phase separation not visible, add 200uL of CHCl 3 and vortex again. Addition of Acetic Acid acidifies the sample and causes for the conversion of Fatty Acid Soaps to their Free Fatty Acid form.
