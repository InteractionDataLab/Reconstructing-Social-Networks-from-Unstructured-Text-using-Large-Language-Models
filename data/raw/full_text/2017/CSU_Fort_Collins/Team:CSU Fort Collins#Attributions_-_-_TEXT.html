CSU’s synthetic biology club is an independent, volunteer organization.  New members were recruited in Febuary, with weekly meetings covering topics such as synthetic biology, Limonene, Thermococcus kodakarensis, and paper presentations.
A two day lab methods seminar was held in April taught by advisor Claudia Gentry-Weeks.
Laboratory work in the Santangelo lab started in May.
