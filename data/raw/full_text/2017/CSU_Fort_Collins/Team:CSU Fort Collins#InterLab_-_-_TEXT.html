Experimental Approach
The Interlab Study protocols for transformation and plate reader use that were followed came directly from the iGEM website.
Results
All of the test cultures, including the negative and positive control plates with growing colonies were given to us by the University of Colorado Boulder iGEM team. We were able to successfully grow up all of the cultures and take samples at the following time points: 0, 2, 4, and 6. After collecting all of these samples, we used a plate reader to measure the optical density of our cultures. Our plate reader was not able to read the fluorescence in the format the iGEM required. As a result of having equipment malfunction, we were not allowed to submit our data collectively with other iGEM teams that participated in the Interlab study.
