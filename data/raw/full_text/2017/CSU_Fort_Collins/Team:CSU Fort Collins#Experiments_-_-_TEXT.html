Recap.
7.7.2016
These are the sequences for the two C. Limon gene blocks that are being used for our current experiments:
Blue/White screening allowed colonies with the gene block to be isolated
From the first plate with the C. Limon gene block 1, 3 colonies were picked and the miniprep protocol from the lab was followed, these samples are listed as 1A, 1B, 1C from here on out.  The same goes for the second C. Limon gene, except one of the culture tubes was broken so there are only two samples 2B and 2C.
Nano Dropped each of the following samples to determine the DNA concentration: 1A, 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C. Also, performed digestion on the concentrated plasmid using the NEB protocol with adjusted amounts of each material.
The nanodrop results are listed below:
1A: 325.5 ng/uL
1B: 325.9 ng/uL
1C: 381.6 ng/uL
2B: 243.9 ng/uL
2C: 332.7 ng/uL
The 260/280 ratio for each measurement was around 1.83, which means that the DNA is pretty pure. After nano dropping each of the plasmids we used the following measurements for the digestion protocol:
For amount of DNA:
1A: 3.1uL
1B:2.1 uL
1C: 2.6 uL
2B: 4.1uL
2C: 3.0uL
10X Cutsmart:
5uL, making it 1X concentration
EcoR1:
1uL
Sterile DI Water:
1A: 40.9uL
1B: 40.9 uL
1C: 41.4 uL
2B: 39.9uL
2C: 41.0 uL
All of the reaction volumes came out to 50uL and were placed in the thermocycler following this program: 37°C for 1 hour and 30 minutes, then it is going to be heat inactivated at 65°C for 30 minutes, then held at 4°C until tomorrow.
7.10.16
Took digested plasmid from 7.8.16 and ran it through a gel with 1kb+ ladder to confirm that the plasmid had been cut in the correct place. Results are shown below, the order of the wells are:
LADDER
1A
1B
2A
2B
2C
There seem to be bands at around 4,000 base pairs, which matches up with the StrataClone Blunt PCR Cloning Vector pSC-B-amp/kan containing 4.3 kb
There are also bands around 1298 for 1B only, which is the correct number of bp’s for C.Limon 1, and there are also two bands for 2B and 2C at around 817 base pairs, confirming that the gene blocks were cut a out of the Strataclone vector at the correct spot
7.12.16

7.14.16
Performed mini-prep on the prepared cultures from the white colonies on blunt cloning plate for: 1B, 2B, 2C (all of the plasmids that had bands on the gel)
Received all four primers today and resuspended each so that the concentration was 100uM
We are going to perform PCR with the phusion enzyme to amplify the C. Sten g-blocks before we try Blunt Cloning
For all four of the primers, we created a 10uM concentration by diluting 1ul of primer with 9ul of sterile diH2O
Component: 50μl reaction
Molecular grade H2O: Added first. 32.5μL
5x GC Buffer: 10μL
10 mM dNTPs: 1.0μL
L. Synthase forward (10μM): 2.5μL
C. Sten 1 - Reverse (10μM): 2.5μL
C. Sten g-block 1: 1.0μL
Tom’s Phusion DNA polymerase: Added last. 0.5μL
Component: 50μl reaction
Molecular grade H2O: Added first. 32.5μL
5x GC Buffer: 10μL

Sten 2 - Forward (10μM): 2.5μL
Template DNA: 1.0μL
Tom’s Phusion DNA polymerase: Added last. 0.5μL
Ran the PCR reaction in the with Thermocycler Program as follows, for both of the C.Sten g-blocks
7.15.16
Sent in mini-prepped tubes containing Blunt cloning plasmid and C. Limon g-blocks  to quintarabio for sequencing results using the T3 and T7 primers that correspond with the blunt cloning kit primer binding sites, the concentrations for each of the g-blocks is listed below
1B-264.0ng/ml, 260/280-1.75
2B-338.0ng/ml, 260/280-1.78
2C-304.5ng/ml, 260/280-1.70
Ran the gel from the PCR performed on C. Sten 7.14.16 to see if the g-block was successfully amplified, results are shown below following this key: ladder, C. Sten 1, C. Sten 2, we are expecting 1198 bp’s for C.Sten 1, and 897 bp’s for C.Sten 2
It seems like the C. Sten 1 was unsuccessful, so we will instead perform a two step PCR corresponding to the table below, with adjusted temperatures and extension time, also we will use more of the Phusion enzyme, since it is not commercial grade
C. Sten 2 seems to have bands at around 897 base pairs, which is the correct number, but there also seems to be some other bands, so we will run another gel on 7.16.16 with the C.Sten 1 Two-step PCR product and also, the 41ul of the rest of the C.Sten PCR product from 7.14.16, then we will cut it from the gel and purify it if there are bands at around 1198 base pairs (did not do this)
C. Sten 1, 2-step PCR
7.16.16
Performed PCR on C. Sten 1 again, since gel did not have correct band
Ran a gel with the 41ul of the rest of PCR product from C.Sten 2 and ran PCR product from today, ladder, 6 wells filled with C.Sten 1, 41ul of C.Sten 2 in last well
It was a failure so we are going to reorder the limonene synthase forward primer, because the melting temp. was so high (77.8°C)
This is the new primer we ordered:
ATG CGC GTT GCG GCA GTC GAC (GC=66.7%, melting temp=71.3°C, bp=21)
We will perform the two-step PCR again with both gene blocks, once the new forward primer arrives
7.19.16
Results from quintarabio for 1B, 2B, 2C were received today, results are as follows:
1B non conclusive, T3 and T7 sequences did not align
2B seemed to have worked, picture of aligned sequences is shown below
2C had some alignment, but a few couple of mismatched base pairs that proved to have non silent mutations when put into the Expasy program
I aligned the second part of the g-block with a spliced sequence I created from the T3 sequence and the RC of the T7 sequence, this is the spliced sequence I used, the yellow highlighted area was the sequence chosen that splits the two gene blocks apart:
Strataclone T3 sequence through PCR product,green is T3 primer binding site  yellow is discrepancy in the spliced gene and the starting sequence in the strataclone vector

7.21.16
Sequencing results came in for miniprep done on 7.20 and I am thinking that the first gene block was inserted in a reverse orientation into the plasmid.
Same exact thing happened to the sequencing results from 7/15 for 1B, below is the C.Limon first part of the g-block aligned with the RC of the 1A spliced seq.
7.21.16
PCR with sten 1 & 2; This time, using the new forward primer.
I’m thinking we should nanodrop to check for amplification instead of running a gel as we can save more of our sample if the result is good. Also, the gel won’t tell us a concentration, and we already know the gene block is in the reaction mix. We need to check the concentration of DNA.
After confirming that the gene blocks have been amplified, we should try the PCR assembly protocol or infusion cloning. We need to put the gene blocks together.

Re-did the PCR on C.Sten 1 and 2 using this mixture protocol:
I had to dilute all four of the primers, 1:10 and I also dilute the 25mM dntps to 10mM 2:5
7.25.16
Ran a gel with the PCR products from 7.24, pic is shown below
1A and 2B off of Madeline’s master plate, ladder c.sten 1 and c.sten 2
Confirmed with Sharon that the orientation of the gene block in the strataclone vector does not matter, so in this case, we can move forward with experimentation with the first gene block (miniprep, phusion PCR)
7.29.16
Redid the PCR with a 66-70°C gradient, and started a culture with 1A and 2B from madeline’s master plate
Diluted the 4 C. sten primers to 10mM and dNTPs to 10mM

Performed the gel purification protocol from the lab, including the following changes:
Only did 1 membrane wash
Did not pre heat the elution buffer
Did the final elution with 15uL of the 10mM tris-HCL ph 8.8
Both parts of the gene block will be nanodropped tomorrow to see how high the concentration of DNA is
8.10.16
PCR with minipreped stataclone vector + insert from culture started on 7.29.16
We have 4 samples, 1A, 1B, 2B, 2C

We tried infusion cloning with C.sten 1 and 2 g-blocks, these were the ones that were not in the strataclone vector, so after PCR amplification and running a gel to confirm amplification, we attempted to just directly clone both g-blocks into the pLC71 vector
We used a 1:1:1 molar ratio for 1st g-block:2nd g-block:pLC71 and the values for each are shown below, keep in mind we had two PCR products for each g-block, so they are separated by eppendorf tube color, in this case we only used C.sten 1 blue and C.sten 2 yellow
C.Sten 1 blue: 1.36 uL
C. Sten 2 yellow: 1.02uL
pLC71:0.88uL, dilution- 2uL pLC71 + 2uL sterile H2O, this way we could use 1.8uL instead of 0.88 which is hard to achieve with a pipette
3.8uL of water
We did a negative control that contained everything listed above, except for the infusion mix
After following the Infusion protocol, we followed the Interlab transformation protocol, except we added 2 uL of the plasmid instead of 1uL, also when we plated after the outgrowth period, we use 50uL on one plate, and the rest on another plate, ~200uL

Nanodropping: C. Limon 1B & 2B in the strataclone vector
1B: 361.4 ng/μL 260/280: 1.84
2B: 368.9 ng/μL 260/280: 1.84
PCR:
M1V1 = M2V2
V1B = (2μL)(361.4 ng/μL) / (10ng/μL) = 72.28 μL
V1B = (2μL)(361.4ng/μL) / (10ng/μL) = 73.78 μL
So, to dilute the plasmids to 10 ng/μL..
1B: 2μL stock + 70.3μL dH2O
1B: 2μL stock + 71.8μL dH2O
Primers:
1B: Limonene Forward + C.limon1R
2B: C.limon2F + LSp2
We have 100μM primers, we want 10μM.
M1V1 = M2V2
V = (2μL)(100μM) / (10μM) = 20μL
So to dilute the primers…
2μL stock + 18μL dH2O

PCR failed. New idea; add DSMO (5% volume). Also try raising the annealing temperature.
Brett Burkart, an employee of the Santangelo lab, gave Casey this protocol for purifying PCR products.
PB buffer
Add 5x the volume of the combined PCR reactions.
Combined PCR reactions: 177µL
PB Buffer: 885µL
3M NaOAc pH 5.2
Add 1/100x the volume of the PCR reaction + PB buffer
Spin through column (may take two runs).
Discard flow through.
Load column with 750µL ethanol, spin.
Discard ethanol, spin 2 minutes to dry.
Label 1.7mL eppe.
Load 25µL 10mM tris HCl pH 8.5
Spin 2 mins. collect in labeled eppe.
Load 25µL 10mM tris HCl pH 8.5
Spin 2 mins. collect in same labeled eppe.
