In many cases, these illnesses go unreported, are unrecognized, or are asymptomatic, and can lead to many chronic conditions including kidney and liver failure, as well as cancer<SUB>2</SUB>. The problem is further exacerbated in developing nations where sanitary conditions are scarce and climates are far more conducive for bacterial growth.  

Thus, it has become necessary to create a cheap, effective, and mobile screening platform for simple detection of foodborne pathogens.  Escherichia coli represents a significant proportion of foodborne infections, and is frequently associated with multi-drug resistance<SUB>2</SUB>.  Thus the strain is a prime substrate for the development of a pre-emptive detection platform. 

Current detection methods for bacterial pathogens involve techniques that are financially costly and low-throughput, or otherwise require equipment that is not simple to carry around, sell at a department store, or acquire in the household <SUB>3</SUB>.  We propose a new cost-effective solution involving functional nucleic acids with the ability to cleave RNA in the presence of specific bacteria with the result of a detectable change in fluorescent signal.  There is much work describing the efficacy of the RNA-cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) in the detection of small molecules, peptides, and unique cells <SUB>4</SUB>.  RFDs have been developed and previously demonstrated to produce fluorescence specifically in the presence of small numbers of E. coli<SUB>5</SUB>.  The E.coli-sensitive RFD (RFD-EC1) is a long-term cost-effective product and therefore an ideal candidate for a common household bacterial screening platform. 

The following experiments thus focus on optimizing the application of RFD-EC1 in an agar plate-based assay for quick, user-friendly and sensitive detection of E. coli bacteria.
</P><H1>Timeline of Experiments</H1><H3>Fluorophore</H3><STRONG>May 23, 2017</STRONG><P>This experiment was one of the first to be completed by our team in the Li lab. That being said, the purpose of this experiment was to visualize the relative intensity of DNAzyme fluorescence without exposing it to E. coli. We tested a wide range of DNAzyme concentrations between 100-5000 uM, in a total volume of 10uL. After visualization under UV in Eppendorf tubes, we plated the DNAzyme so that we could see how it would affect our experiments.  The DNAzyme exhibits minimal self-cleavage in small amounts, however we needed larger amounts to detect plate fluorescence. This can become an issue if the fluorescence of the self-cleaved DNAzyme masks the fluorescence of our actual results. Our findings in this experiment led us to restrict DNAzyme usage to under 10uL of 1000uM DNAzyme.</P><H3>Medium Optimization: M9 vs LB (Luria Bertani)</H3><STRONG>June 12-13, 2017</STRONG><P>Throughout the initial experiments, we found that it was difficult to visualize the fluorescence of the DNAzyme responding to the E. coli due to the autofluorescence caused by the LB agar. This background fluorescence affected results both under UV light as well as Typhoon Imager images. In light of this, we decided to test M9 minimal media to reduce this background fluorescence issue. To compare the two media types, we created 60mm plates with both LB or M9 with differing volumes of media. The UV results were very astonishing in the magnitude of contrast between the fluorescence given off by these two media types. For all future experiments plates containing 2.5mL of M9 media were used. More experiments and optimization were then completed to ensure growth of multiple bacterial species upon the M9 media.</P><H3>Testing DNA Specificity</H3><STRONG>June 22-25, 217</STRONG><P>The DNAzyme itself cleaves specifically in the presence of E. coli K12 RNAse I protein, some of which can be found in the extracellular matrix. The purpose of conducting this experiment was to observe the contrast between the fluorescence of the DNAzyme when dropped on E. coli K12 colonies vs E. coli K12 delta RNAse I colonies, and to test both the specificity and the sensitivity of the DNAzyme. The bacteria was incubated overnight for 16 hours before 10pmol of DNAzyme was pipetted onto the colonies. After Typhoon imaging, we observed a substantial difference in fluorescence between E. coli K12 colonies and E. coli K12 delta RNAse colonies. </P><H3>Fluorescence Detecting Wavelength</H3><STRONG>July 25th, 2017</STRONG><P>We wanted to ensure that the wavelength of our measurements using the Typhoon imager were the best possible settings that would produce the most accurate results. Our DNAzyme utilizes fluorescein which has a peak excitation at 488nm and a peak emission at 526nm, but it was in our best interest to make sure that our settings while imaging were appropriate. A variety of wavelengths were tested (see image for details) and it was found that <STRONG>    nm</STRONG> was the best option.</P><H3>Bacterial Autofluorescence</H3><STRONG>August 20, 2017</STRONG><P>Bacterial autofluorescence also posed an issue as E. coli K12 itself fluorescences at a similar wavelength as the fluorophore, fluorescein. To address this problem we observed the autofluorescence produced by increasing amounts of bacteria. We plated 10^7, 10^5, 10^4, and 10^3 bacteria and incubated for 16 hours before imaging with UV light and the Typhoon imager. The results displayed helped in the next experiment which involved optimizing the bacterial cell number necessary to elicit a DNAzyme response but low enough to avoid major bacterial autofluorescence.</P><H3>DNAzyme Autofluorescence</H3><STRONG>August 21, 2017</STRONG><P>As it is difficult to view contrasting fluorescence, we worked to quantify and minimize the amount of autofluorescence produced from this DNAzyme.
4 eppendorf tubes were holding 5uL of DNAzyme diluted to different amounts (40pmol/5uL,30pmol/5uL, 20pmol/5uL, 10pmol/5uL). All tubes were then imaged to view the impact the amount of DNAzyme has on fluorescence.
Results show that difference in fluorescence is significant in tubes, but show differently when dropped onto plates as it spreads.</P><H3>Optimal Response</H3><STRONG>August 21, 2017</STRONG><P>Considering DNAzyme autofluorescence, we aimed to generate the optimal response for the DNAzyme to detect E. coli K12 while minimizing all autofluorescence.
5uL of 10-40pmol of DNAzyme was dropped onto quadrants on a plate with E. coli grown in increasing amount (10^3 to 10^7 cells/quandrant). Based on results, 10^4 cells with 40pmol of DNAzyme had the optimal response while accounting for background fluorescence. It was also noticed after August 21 that reaction buffer (2X SB) was not included for this experiment. As a result, experiments after August 21 do not include reaction buffer to obtain results.</P><H3>DNAzyme Specificity - 2X Selection Buffer Added</H3><STRONG>August 21, 2017</STRONG><P>After establishing what we thought to be the optimal amount of DNAzyme and bacterial cells, we wanted to verify the specificity of the DNAzyme solely for E. coli K12, and show the inability to cleave against other bacterial species. 10^4 cells of 6 different bacterial species were plated in separate quadrants and grown overnight. 40pmol of DNAzyme was then dropped on top along with reaction buffer.
Typhoon scans show DNAzyme fluoresces slightly stronger in the presence of E. coli compared to other species, but this difference is not significant enough. We hypothesized that the addition of selection buffer may cause premature cleavage.</P><H3>Tracking Fluorescence Over Time</H3><STRONG>August 21, 2017</STRONG><P>To quantify DNAzyme fluorescence over time and determine whether the addition of selection buffer impacts fluorescence results, 10^4 cells were spread and incubated for 16 hours and 40pmol of DNAzyme was dropped afterwards. Typhoon scans show that DNAzyme fluorescence fades after 2 hours and that selection buffer does not seem to make much difference in fluorescence when interacting with E. coli.</P><H3>Specificity Test - Without Selection Buffer</H3><STRONG>September 28, 2017</STRONG><P>After deciding to leave out selection buffer from plate experiments involving DNAzyme, we wanted to once again test  the specificity of the DNAzyme and supply appropriate measurements for data analysis. 10^4 cells of 6 bacterial types were dropped into separate quadrants then grown for 16 hours. 40pmol of DNAzyme was dropped afterwards onto the quadrants and examined. Under UV light, DNAzyme glows bright when dropped onto E. coli and appears to show no visible fluorescence with other species.</P><H1>Protocols</H1><DIV class="DropDown-menu"><A href="#" class="active">Home</A><A href="#TestingFluorescenceofBacterialPlates">Testing Fluorescence of Bacterial Plates </A><A href="#Fluorophore_Concentrations">Fluorophore Concentrations</A><A href="#Optimizing_Concentrations_Cleavage">Optimizing Concentrations &amp; Cleavage</A><A href="#M9_vs_LB_Autofluorescence_via_Agar_Thickness">M9 vs LB Autofluorescence via Agar Thickness</A><A href="#Cell_Detection_Using_DNAzyme_in_M9">Cell Detection Using DNAzyme in M9</A><A href="#Differing_[NaOH]_for_Positive_Control">Differing [NaOH] for Positive Control</A><A href="#Testing_DNAzyme_Sensitivity">Testing DNAzyme Sensitivity</A><A href="#DNAzyme_Specificity">DNAzyme Specificity</A><A href="#Bacterial_Mixture">Bacterial Mixture</A><A href="#Fluorescence_detecting_wavelength">Fluorescence detecting wavelength</A><A href="#Optimal_DNAzyme">Optimal DNAzyme Concentration</A><A href="#Quantifying_Autofluorescence">Quantifying Autofluorescence</A><A href="#Fluorescing_Colonies">Fluorescing Colonies</A><A href="#DNAzyme_Autofluorescence">DNAzyme Autofluorescence</A><A href="#New_DNAzyme_Stock">New DNAzyme Stock</A><A href="#Bacterial_Autofluorescence">Bacterial Autofluorescence</A><A href="#DNAzyme_Autofluorescence2">DNAzyme Autofluorescence</A><A href="#Optimal_Response2">Optimal Response</A><A href="#DNAzyme_Specificity">DNAzyme Specificity</A><A href="#Tracking_Fluorescence_Over_Time">Tracking Fluorescence Over Time</A><A href="#Experiments_Redone_Without_Selection_Buffer">Experiments Redone Without Selection Buffer</A><A href="#Enzyme_Kinetics_96_Well_Plate">Enzyme Kinetics &amp; 96 Well Plate</A><A href="#PNK_Step">PNK Step (T4 Polynucleotide Kinase)</A><A href="#Quantifying_DNA">Quantifying DNA</A></DIV><SECTION id="TestingFluorescenceofBacterialPlates"><H2>Testing Fluorescence of Bacterial Plates</H2><P><STRONG>Date:</STRONG> May 18 <STRONG>Reagents:</STRONG></P><UL><LI>3x DNAzyme stock: 13.35 uL (200nM final concentration)</LI><LI>2x Selection Buffer (150uL)</LI><LI>dH2O: 136.65uL</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Protocol:</STRONG></P><OL><LI>The DNAzyme stock solution above was assembled in an Eppendorf tube.</LI><LI>100 uL of DNAzyme stock solution was pipetted into Plates 1,2, and 3.

A denaturing PAGE (Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) gel is a common method for separating small &lt;500 nt nucleic acids. This gel contains high concentrations of urea as a denaturing agent. There are several methods available to visualize nucleic acids on PAGE gels, Radiolabeled nucleic acids can be visualized using film exposure or phosphor storage screens. Fluorescently modified nucleic acids can be visualized by fluorescence. Bands containing more than 300 ng of nucleic acids can be detected by UV shadow. Bands can be excised and nucleic acids extracted using Crush-Soak method.

Using binder clips, clamp the glass plate assembly to the top reservoir along the top two sides, the goal is to form a watertight seal between the reservoir gasket and the notched glass plate so as to allow buffer to enter the wells. </LI><LI>On a thick thickness, medium sized gel which McMaster iGEM is making, attach a metal cooling plate to the back of the glass plate assembly with 2 binder clips. </LI><LI>Add the minimum volume of 1X TBE buffer to the top and bottom reservoirs necessary to fill the well and contact the gel </LI><LI>TBE buffer stands for Tris/Borate/EDTA, the components from which it is made, and is a buffer solution used in protocols involving electrophoresis of nucleic acids.

Replug power supply after loading to let gel run.</LI><LI>Cover gel glass panes with a tin foil layer to protect DNA from UV degradation from light while running.</LI><LI>Let run for approximately 1 hour until the top yellow band visible to the naked eye reaches halfway point on the gel. </LI><H3>dPAGE Excision for DNA extraction</H3><OL><LI>With the notched plate facing up, remove the two spacers along the edges. With a thin spatula, carefully separate the top two glass plates, the gel will stay attached to one of the glass plates. Be careful not to rip the gel! 
With the gel facing up, lay a sheet of plastic wrap over the gel minimizing wrinkles and bubbles. </LI><LI>Grasping the plastic wrap and the glass plate underneath, flip the entire assembly over so the glass plate is facing up. </LI><LI>Lift one end of the glass plate slightly when carefully separating the gel from the glass plate with a thin spatula, proceed until the gel has completely separated from the glass plate. </LI><LI>Apply a second sheet of plastic film to the gel. </LI><LI>Trim the excess film. </LI><LI>Place a blade under the gel to provide sterile surface after wrapping both ends of gel with cellophane</LI><LI>Unclip bottom 2 clips from the gel electrophoresis machine, let the buffer drip down, then lay the glass pane horizontal</LI><LI>Take out teeth and black side stripes on either side, peel off one side of glass pane and cover that side with cellophane.</LI><LI>Flip over and do the same for the other side so the gel is fully wrapped in cellophane</LI><LI>Wrap the ends and edges of excess cellophane</LI><LI>Image gel using UV machine (for fluorescence) as well as a handheld UV 260 for DNA</LI><LI>Identify the band holding the “pure” DNAzyme under UV light. Try to minimize amount of time DNAzyme spends under UV light by quickly drawing a rectangle around the glowing top yellow band (there should be 2 bands) and excising outside of the UV light room. Too much UV light exposure can cause DNAzyme to mutate, impacting specificity.</LI><LI>Draw outline of the top yellow band during UV lighting to later excise and cut away using microblades</LI><LI>Cut using microblades through the cellophane, along the lines of the outline drawn earlier</LI><LI>Cut box into 3 even sections</LI><LI>Carefully peel back cellophane and deposit each gel square into an Eppendorf, folding it if need be</LI><LI>Crush gel square into a paste within each Eppendorf with a pipette tip or metal spatula.  Ensure no paste gets stuck within the tip or lost from the spatula and Eppendorf – wasted DNA</LI></OL><H3>Crush and soak DNA Extraction from Gel</H3><OL><LI>Elute with elution buffer (600 uL) for 20 minutes, spin and shake with shake machine</LI><LI>Take out of shaker and spin in mini-centrifuge until there is a visible divide between gel and supernatant liquid</LI><LI>Take out supernatant and put together in a different Eppendorf. Label as Supernatant 1 (IMPORTANT, THIS HOLDS DNAZYMES EXTRACTED FROM THE GEL)</LI><LI>Add 400 uL of elution buffer again to each gel only Eppendorf, shake again for 20 minutes and elute again by repeating steps 8.a to 8.b. Store in one Eppendorf if possible.</LI><LI>Now aliquot the supernatant Eppendorf into more Eppendorfs so that the optimal volume for each Eppendorf holds 400 uL of supernatant. If volume in each Eppendorf is not 400 uL, aliquot around 200 uL of volume into the remaining Eppendorf so that adding 1000 uL of ethanol will not overflow 1.5 mL Eppendorf volume capacities.</LI><LI>Add 10%* of the total volume of NaOAc to the eluted solution and then add 1000 uL of 100% ethanol add end. (Ex: so add 40 uL of NaOAc to 400 uL of elution buffer)</LI><LI>Freeze the solution tubes in -20 degrees Celsius freezer, put the tubes in the cold room with tin foil on top to block off light interfering with DNAzyme fluorescence for a minimum of 20 minutes (longer periods of time such as overnight may result in better yield).</LI><LI>Centrifuge @15000 RPM for 20 min. You should see clear-ish supernatant and at the bottom, orangey specks of solid DNAzyme pellet. These orange specks are now crucial to holding your DNAzyme… please do not lose!</LI><LI>Remove supernatant and to the pellet remaining in Eppendorf, add 500 uL of 70% ethanol. BE CAREFUL NOT TO REMOVE ANY OF THE PELLET ALONG WITH THE SUPERNATENT. CENTRIFUGE AGAIN IF PELLET GETS MIXED UP IN THE SUPERNATENT.</LI><LI>Centrifuge again for 10 min then remove supernatant, put pellet tube open in speed vacuum for 15 minutes for ethanol precipitation.</LI><LI>After ethanol precipitation, should have a dry visible pellet at the end of the Eppendorf tube.</LI><LI>Add 100 uL of H2O into each tube (and following the actions of 2.a and 2.b, one after one wash again – 50 uL wash then 50 uL H2O to wash again) to put all DNAzyme solutions into one Eppendorf</LI><LI>End should have 1 Eppendorf tube with ~90 uL of orangey fluid (DNAzymes)</LI><LI>Keep cool</LI></OL></PR><SECTION id="Quantifying_DNA"><H2>Quantifying DNA</H2><P>Use a spectrophotometer to meeasure the concentration and absorbance.
