Overview
The Interlab Study, developed by the Measurement Committee of iGEM as a way to standardize measurements for green fluorescent protein (GFP), tackles the foundational synthetic biology problem of a lack of reliable measurements for experiments. With an international standard set down, scientists can go beyond utilizing relativity comparisons for results, to conduct quantitative reproducibility studies across labs. This Interlab experiment, carried out by McMaster iGEM with plate readers, aims to produce comparable GFP measurements as a contribution for the international standardization of GFP values. The parts we used were BBA_J364000 (1), BBa_J364001 (2), BBa_J364002 (3), BBa_J36003 (4), BBa_J364004 (5), BBa_J364005 (6), and positive control BBa_120270 with negative control BBa_R0040. All parts were located in pSB1C3 plasmid and were modified for chloramphenicol resistance.

Protocol of Fluorescein Fluorescence Standard Curve
Materials:
Fluorescein
10 mL 1x PBS (phosphate buffered saline)
96 well plate, Corning 96 Flat Bottom black, clear bottom Polystyrol (COR96fb clear bottom)
Methods:
Spin down fluorescence stock tube until pellet is at bottom of tube
Resuspend 100 uM stock Fluorescein in 1 mL of 1x PBS to obtain 2x fluorescein stock solution.
Ensure that Fluorescein is properly dissolved.
Dilute 2x fluorescin stock solution with 1x PBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution. Resulting concentration of fluorescein stock solution should be 50 uM (otherwise known as 500 uL of 2x fluoresceine in 500 uL of 1x PBS that makes 1 mL of 50 uM of 1x fluorescein solution).
Prepare for serial dilutions across columns 1 to 11. Ensure column 12 has PBS buffer only.
Pipette 200 uL of 1x fluorescein stock into wells A1, B1, C1, D1.
Pipette 100 uL of PBS in wells A2, B2, C2, D2 ... A12, B12.
Transfer 100 uL of fluorescein stock solution from A1 to A2.
Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 uL into A3.
Mix A3 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 uL into A4.
Repeat 5c to 5e for A4, A5, A6.... to A11.
Mix A11 by pipetting up and down 3x and then transfer 100 uL into liquid waste. Ensure that A12 is PBS only
Repeat step 5 for columns B, C, and D.
Measure fluorescence of all samples in the plate reader (settings listed above in Plate Reader Setup menu).
Record data in Fluorescein Standard Curve excel sheet and graph.

Pick 2 colonies from each plate and inoculate on a 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol.
18 tubes of 5 mL LB with 5 uL of chloramphenicol (25 ug/mL)
Grow cells overnight for 16-18 hours at 37 degrees Celsius and at 220 rpm.
Measure cell growth with spectrophotometer:
Set spectrophotometer to read OD600.
Measure OD600 of overnight cultures (placed in 1 mL spectrophotometer cuvettes) after calibrating instrument with distilled H2O.
Record data and transfer data into the Dilution Calculation Sheet_1 provided by iGEM Headquarters.
Dilute all cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 12 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol in a 50 mL capacity Falcon Tube covered with aluminum foil to block light.
Incubate cultures at 37 degrees Celsius and at 220 rpm.
Take 500 uL samples of each of the cultures at 0 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours of incubation.
Total samples taken should be 16 samples, with 2 samples from each 8 devices at each time point.
Do not reuse samples
Place samples on ice in meantime while pipetting them into the plate to be measured.
When pipetting into the clear bottom plate to be measured by the TECAN Infinite M1000 plate reader using absorbance and fluorescence:
Pipette both samples into replicates of 4 each so that there are 4 wells, each filled with 100 uL, for each sample.
This totals to 8 wells of 100 uL per device.
Plate setup should look like
Measure with plate reader with both absorbance and fluorescence.
