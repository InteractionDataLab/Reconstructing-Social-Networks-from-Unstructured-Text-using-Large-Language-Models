DNAzyme Results
Fluorophore Concentrations Optimization
Goal: to find the range of visible fluorescence by DNAzymes under UV light.
10 uL of DNAzyme was dropped on each quadrant. Concentrations of the DNAzyme are illustrated on the images, in units of uM.
We've proved that our DNAzyme is functional in the fluorescence aspect and that it will show up visibly under UV light on the plate medium we hope for our prototype to be used in. We learned that the liquid DNA dropped sinks quickly into the plate's gel (composed of LB media). We also learned that liquid DNAzyme displayed in an Eppendorf tube is much more visible than DNAzyme dropped on LB medium.
Use of M9 Minimal Media vs. LB media and Optimizing Plate Medium Thicknesses
Goal was to find if LB medium or M9 Minimal Media was optimal for visibility of the DNAzyme on a plate-based medium, and which thickness of the gel would be most conducive for reducing background media autofluorescence interfering with DNAzyme-specific fluorescence.
Results: We found that M9 media was best for increased visibility of DNAzyme effects due to the increased contrast resulting from less media-originated autofluorescence. The optimal thickness of the gels for DNAzyme visibility was determined to be 1.2732 mm, with 1.088 mL poured in a small (33 mm diameter x 10 mm height) plate, and 2.5 mL poured in a larger (50 mm diameter, 10 mm height) plate.

Bacteria was streaked on each plate in respective quadrants and grown overnight.
The next morning, the DNAzymes were dropped onto the cells and the FDNA was dropped into the 3rd quadrant.
The M9 media is pH 8, 2.5 mL
