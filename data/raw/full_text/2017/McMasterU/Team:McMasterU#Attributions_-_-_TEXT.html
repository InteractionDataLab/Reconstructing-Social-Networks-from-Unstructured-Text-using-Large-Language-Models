Project support and advice
Project suppport and advice must be accredited to the mentors and department heads who facilitated the project design. Special thanks to Damian Tran, Tony Chen, Rayu Bhatt, Melodie Kim, Dhanyasri Maddiboina, and also to our wet lab members who have worked tirelessly throughout the summer to bring this project into reality: Julie Fothergill-Robinson, Audrey Jong, Jessica Chee, Neda Pirouzmand, Sean Leung and Angela Dong.
Fundraising help and advice
Karanbir Brar, Maxwell Ng, Yosef Ellenbogen, Murtuza Rajkotwala, Jinny Lee, Angela Dong, and the rest of the business development team have helped widely with garnering sponsorships both within and outside of the university and student union funds, reaching out to numerous community organizations.
Lab support
Lab support has been generously provided for by Dr. Yingfu Li in providing the primary lab for our summer epxeriments while Dr. Rosa da Silva provided the lab facilities for training of the wet lab members. Various graduate students working in the Li Lab at the time of our experimentation also provided valuable input and project mentorship. Such grad students include Dingran Chang, Jim Gu, Thomas Chang, Shahrzad and Wenqing.
Difficult technique support
Difficult technique support was carried out on the wet lab side by Dingran Chang in the ligation of the DNAzyme fluorophore. Difficult technique support was also carried out by Wenqing and Shahrzad for other wet lab projects, most notably for the development of the Tcdc plasmid.
Project advisor support
Project advisor support is credited to our advisor Tony He Tian Chen as well as to our wet lab mentor Damian Tran for their work on the design and troubleshooting of various aspects of the project.
Wiki support
Wiki support is credited to Ian Fare and Eva Liu, the dry lab heads, as well as to the dry lab team comprised of Maggie Hou, Siddarth Reed, Judy Chen, and Biren Dave. Contributions towards the entries in our wiki were donated from all members of the club.
Presentation coaching
Presentation coaching was done by Tony He Tian Chen, Jinny Lee, and non-club affiliated students of the McMaster health science faculty who provided feedback and advice on presentation style.
Human Practices support
Human practices was largely supported by the members of the human practices team (Fatima Sheikh, Krish Bilimoria, Christina Machon, Aline-Claire Huynh) led by former HP head Jinny Lee and current HP head Rachael Gregoris.
Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team.
