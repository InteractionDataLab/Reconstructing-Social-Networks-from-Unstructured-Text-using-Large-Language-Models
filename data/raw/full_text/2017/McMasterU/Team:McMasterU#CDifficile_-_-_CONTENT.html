This DNAzyme will be enriched from a combinatorial sequence library of around 10^15 single-stranded DNA with central random sequences. The DNAzyme will be selected using the 61-aa (NAP1) and 65-aa (NAP7) truncated variants of C. difficile TcdC (expressed in E. coli) as the target. This target was chosen because of its low identify ratio between wild type and pathogenic strains of C. difficile. An oligonucleotide containing a fluorophore-riboadenosine-quencher motif will be ligated to the random single-stranded DNA library. DNAzymes will be selected from the library based on their ability to cleave the riboadenosine in the presence of the TcdC variants specified above. Negative selection of the library will be performed sequentially in the presence of E. coli, wild type TcdC, and B. subtilis CEM. We have cloned NAP1, NAP7, and wild type TcdC into pET15 plasmids and are currently working on expressing the genes.</P><H2> Plasmid Design</H2><CENTER><P> Green light inducible plasmid </P><P> Red light inducible plasmid </P><P> Chromophore producing plasmid </P></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="band"><H2> Project Design</H2><H1>In-Vitro Selection</H1><P>Genetic evolution by natural selection has guided life as we know it through billions of years of Earth’s harshest environments, giving rise to millions of diverse and steadfast lifeforms that we see around us today.  In the lab, we can mimic this grandiose process to our advantage on a microscale using a technique called in-vitro selection<SUP>1</SUP>.  By following Darwin’s principles of natural selection in a controlled environment, it is possible to artificially evolve large groups of DNA molecules from randomness and select for those with useful functions.  This is done by exposing large, “random libraries” of short DNA strands to other molecules of interest, and removing the species in the pool that don’t react to them in the way we desire.  These reactions are observed on the macroscale using the tried and true technique of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on the radio-labelled, denatured (untied and linearized) DNA libraries after exposure.  In the end, an assortment of DNA molecules comprising of more than a quintillion random nucleotide sequences is reduced to a handful of highly specific, functional product species.</P><P>If selected successfully to process a substrate on que, these nucleic acids are called DNAzymes.  We work with DNAzymes that have been artificially selected to serve as a detection platform for E. coli, one of the most infamous antimicrobial drug-resistant strains of bacteria in the world<SUP>2,3</SUP>.  Our DNAzymes react in the presence of a cocktail of molecules radiated specifically from the extracellular matrix of the E. coli bacterium.  The ensuing process results in the cleavage of an RNA unit bridging a quencher-fluorophore DNA complex, resulting in the emission of a signature green glow.  In essence, we’ve used one of nature’s oldest solutions to generate something innovative, creative, and potentially revolutionary to the field of medical point-of-care testing.</P><H1>Compiled Protocols for TcdC Plasmids Design</H1><H2>I.
