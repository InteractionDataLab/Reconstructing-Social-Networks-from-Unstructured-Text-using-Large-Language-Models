The original project
            have been illustrated in the
            <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:HFUT-China/HP/Silver">silver page</A>. One of the highlights of our integrated human practice project is the VR-open day. After finishing
            the VR game, we decided to popularize it to the public. That’s how we came up with the idea of a VR open-day.
            Virtual reality (VR) is a cutting-edge visualization technology, an interactive 3-D dynamic vision and behavior
            simulation system that combines heterogeneous information. It can achieve really impressive effects when serving
            as a teaching tool, because people tend to accept graphically described things. We want to take the advantage
            of VR technology to help more people learn about Synthetic Biology in an interesting, easy-to-accept way. And at the meantime, we want people to know about our project through the game.

        </DIV></DIV><DIV style="margin-top: 60px;font-family: good;"><B><FONT color="#6f7c91" size="6px">About The Game</FONT></B></DIV><DIV class="p"><DIV class="q" style="line-height: 2.5;">First of all, here is a brief introduction of the game itself and its reward mechanism.
            The design of our rewarding mechanism is inspired by the main function of our system: searching. Trying to find
            useful information in a huge database is like searching for a needle in the ocean, which is arduous. We want
            to create an enjoyable moment for users when they really catch something.
            The award is designed as a “magnifier” floating in the air. By touching it, players can get the award which can
            automatically complete the unfinished gene chains in your container.
             Laymen like primary school students will be able to learn some basic knowledge on Synthetic Biology, such as
            the structure of parts, the concept of promoters and terminators, through collecting and assembling BioBricks
            repetitively.
            </DIV></DIV><DIV style="margin-top: 60px;font-family: good;"><B><FONT color="#6f7c91" size="6px">VR Open Day</FONT></B></DIV><DIV class="p"><DIV class="q" style="line-height: 2.5;">Actually, we split this part into three steps.
            Firstly, we invited our classmates who major in software engineering to try our game thinking that they could
            give some solid suggestions about the game and we could make the game more fun according to the advices. As a
            result, they gave high praise to the game uniformly, and also pointed out that the color didn’t perfectly match
            in the interface. According to their feedback, our designers changed the color and made it look more comfortable.
            Secondly, we invited some biologists to our lab to play the game and give us their professional ideas. They had
            fun playing it and thought it was a really good idea to conduct the popularization of biology through a VR game,
            which follows the trend of the times. Furthermore, they gave some advices about the biobricks. They thought biobricks
            shouldn’t be generated stochastically but should follow the real gene-formation rule. We thought it was really
            a good idea. With some tips in the game, players won’t feel too confused of the operation and can learn the gene
            rule at the meantime.
            Finally, we opened up our lab and welcomed students from all majors to play it. Players had a good time in our
            lab, especially freshmen and sophomores. They are curious and willing to learn about synthetic biology through
            playing our game. While they were playing the game, we also interviewed some of them about their comments about
            the game and how much they had learned about synthetic biology. There were a few students could even recall the
            detailed structure of a gene. Many players were confused of the symbols of &quot;magnifier&quot;. After listening to our explanation, they became more interested in our project. To conclude, what we have achieved have far surpassed what we had expected. We
            seemed to lead a synthetic biology heat in our school. Of course, this success owes much to the propaganda of
            the comers to our open day.
            </DIV></DIV><DIV style="margin-top: 60px;font-family: good;"><B><FONT color="#6f7c91" size="6px">Conclusion</FONT></B></DIV><DIV class="p"><DIV class="q" style="line-height: 2.5;">We achieved the combination of the fundamental concept of iGEM with the design game—creating new bioBricks using
            existing ones. Our game provides a simple and easy way for players who stay far away from Synthetic Biology for
            fear of its complexity and difficulty. Only with more and more people’s engagement can Synthetic Biology continue
            to flourish.
            As a simulation system, VR is updatable, which means the game can keep up with the times and maintain its freshness
            in this quickly changing world. We deeply hope VR could play a supporting role in the development of Synthetic
            Biology, as well as increase the happiness of all iGEM participants.

            2. How do you think of the design of this game?
            3. Have you known how to assemble a gene chain now?
            4. What advice can you give to us?
