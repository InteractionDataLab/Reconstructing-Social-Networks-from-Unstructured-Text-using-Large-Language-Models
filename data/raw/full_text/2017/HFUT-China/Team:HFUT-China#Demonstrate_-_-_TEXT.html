User Evaluation

It is a very good idea to have a searching engine for different projects, teams, biobricks,                                 etc. from previous years. It is effective – saves a lot of time which is very precious to                                 all of us. I liked design of user interface, especially the Gene Relationship part – quite                                 simple and elegant.

The first interface is a very simple search box, the color and composition are very comfortable.The                                 diagram in Gene relationship lists the relationship between the relevant biobricks, and directly                                 experiences its related relationship.In general, the function is very comprehensive, but                                 because of its comprehensive function, the function of its project may be too basic and there                                 is room for improvement.

The search engine BioDesigner Dolphin, is very powerful. This function is so great as there                                 have not been any search engine that is serve for iGEM competition especially.

The searching function for wiki is excellent!! It is really a comprehensive system and it                                 was collected into the list of favorite pages as soon as I opened it.

We are happy to try out the search engine made by team HFUT-China, it really gave us a great experience.                         By typing the keyword, selecting track and team categories, we can search the relevant teams’ information,                         including the team name, year, project introduction, awards, HP, part, or even links of related projects.                         It’s very convenient.
However, there are still some small problems about the page. Considering iGEM teams come from all                         over the world, we suggest adding a translate feature, putting some of the basic information out                         of the local dialect with the Google translation interface.
