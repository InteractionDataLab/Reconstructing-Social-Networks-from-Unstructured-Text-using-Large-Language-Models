BioDesigner Dolphin is devised as a software platform whose theme includes genetic engineering and synthetic biology. The             whole system can be described as three parts, which are information retrieval, parts design and VR Game for Synthetic             Biology.
Information Retrieval
First, we provide great convenience for iGEMers in information retrieval and reduce the difficulty of getting information             which lets participants get familiar with iGEM competition faster: the original information retrieval function             of iGEM can only search the team's wiki by year or team name. BioDesigner Dolphin, however, can search the content             of team wiki. We integrated the team information from 2004 to 2016, transformed it into the same format and made             classification. In addition to searching the corresponding wiki through keywords, users can further filter the             information based on the classification we give.
At the same time, BioDesigner Dolphin brings inspiration to iGEMers on BioBricks research: by using BioDesigner             Dolphin, iGEMers can search for the name of a BioBrick to get the wiki of the team that has used this BioBrick             and looking at what those teams did with the BioBrick. Therefore, BioDesigner Dolphin provides research directions             and inspiration for iGEMers.
Designing Parts
The designing BioBricks section lets users design their own gene chain by simply dragging and dropping BioBricks listed on             the left.
In order to help users design highly dependable and qualified gene chains, recommended BioBricks will also be             listed according to the existing BioBricks on the chain.
Recommendation function aims at recommending what the users might use in their design. Along with search function,             the design process will become more efficient. With Aprior and Markov algorithm, the program can find all the             parts that are related to the parts in users’ bological parts chain design. When users design their devices,             the software can make four kinds of recommendation according to the chosen biobrick-- the biobrick after or ahead             of it, the biobrick between the chosen one and the one after it, the biobrick between chosen and the one ahead             of it.
Visible interface is provided in this part, and the easy operation as well as the friendly environment of it             should not be neglected. With the designing function, participants can be worried no more about designing gene             chains.
VR Game for Synthetic Biology
In order to popularize Synthetic Biology and iGEM, we develop a wonderful VR game. Wearing VR glasses and holding handles,             players can experience an amazing and immersed trip in the game world. The basic idea of the game is collecting             BioBricks to form a gene chain. The whole gene chain will not be accomplished unless BioBricks are collected             in a certain order, which can be interpreted as biological feasibility of the gene chain. Virtual reality is             characterized by immersion, interaction and imagination. Players will obtain knowledge about Synthetic Biology             with happiness.
The three parts of our project mentioned above are devised to meet the demand of other teams and provide comprehensive,             convenient and high-quality services. With our system, the threshold of scientific research will lowered, and             Synthetic Biology is consequently further developed.
