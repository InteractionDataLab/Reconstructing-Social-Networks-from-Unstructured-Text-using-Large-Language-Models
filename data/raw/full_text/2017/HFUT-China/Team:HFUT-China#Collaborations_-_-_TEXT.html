We have a good time working with other teams this year ~ :p
1.University of Science and Technology of China : USTC
We went to the School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China(USTC) to meet up with USTC             and USTC-Software.
In their laboratory, the team members of USTC showed us the using methods of some biology experimental devices,             like centrifuge, shaker, PCR machine, electrophoresis bath, etc. We also learned how to use a pipette. Since             there is no wet lab in our schoole, this introduction gave us a clear recognition of how synthetic biology researchers             work, which make us more interested in synthetic biology.
To make our software more user-friendly, we asked how they would search for information once they had determined             the topic of their project. We introduced our project to them and asked for the most needed function or content             that they are expecting in our project. They have provided much information to us, which is really helpful.
The team leader of USTC interpreted the composition of gene chains for us and the process of assembling a gene             chain. Furthermore, they gave us some advice about the information we provided and thought it could bring a lot             convenience for them.
2.University of Science and Technology of China : USTC-Software
Since we both are software teams, we kept communicating with USTC-Software all along. We made a deal to test             and give feedback each other’s system after finishing it. They pointed out some defects existing in our system             in a professional view and we also made some changes according to it. In return, we tested their system and also             gave some suggestions.
3.Northeast Forestry University : NEFU_China
As software teams, we take advantage of our software techniques and provided support for their wiki, especially             the format of their wiki. In return, they helped us to test our software and gave us some suggestion. One of             the team members thought that the searching function for wiki is excellent!!
4.Ocean University of China : OUC-China
In the information era, it is almost impossible to achieve success through one’s personal effort, and synthetic             biology is without exception. To make our software better meet the requirement of synthetic biologists, we collaborate             with OCU-China.
We exchanged a lot of information. We consulted OUC about parts and biobricks, such as the difference between parts and biobricks. They also helped test our system and gave some suggestions. We gave them some teams that were considered similar to them according to our system and they gave us the feedback.What's more, they helped us test our software, too.
5.Lanzhou University : Lanzhou
We helped Lanzhou University with human practice project. They sent a questionnaire, titled “Present Situation             of iGEM Teams in Chinese Colleges and Universities”, and we provided information for them through a video meeting.             For more detailed information, you can visit Human Practice page of team Lanzhou.
Lanzhou University helped test our system and gave us many valuable suggestions, according to which we improved             our system.
6.Xiamen University : XMU
Xiamen University team tested our system and gave some detailed suggestions about our system. They expressed             appreciation for the fine-looking exterior as well as the pictures of the system. They also thought the information             we provided was of positive reference value to them and the function of designing gene chains was really convenient.
7.Nankai University : NKU
Team NKU tested our system and gave us valuable opinions. They affirmed the practicality and convenience of our             system and put forward some suggestions at the same time. They suggested adding a translate feature, putting             some of the basic information out of the local dialect with the Google translation interface to make our system             more user-friendly.
8. Technische Universitaet Darmstadt : TU_Darmstadt
It is really pleased to have TU Darmstadt test our software. As a wet team, they searched for teams similar to             themselves and get satisfied results. But they also pointed out that there were teams whose information was not             complete.
Furthermore, they used the “Project” function of our software. Some bugs were pointed out by them and they also             gave positive remarks about our idea and the other parts of the system.
9. University of Oslo, Norway : UiOslo_Norway
Dejana from UiOslo tried our system, and thought it was a very good idea to have a searching engine for different             projects, teams, biobricks, etc. in previous years. It is effective – saves a lot of time which is very precious             to all of us.
Dejana said: "Recommending semantically similar keywords to inspire further searching is great! I liked design             of user interface, especially the Gene Relationship part – quite simple and elegant."
