R1:Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
E1: We have been working on our project since this April and are going to attend the Giant Jamboree.
R2: Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page (section 4), except those that specifically                             mention parts.
E2: We have designed our wiki and poster; we are going to do presentation on the Giant Jamboree.                             Since we are software team, we do not handle any biological parts, nor do we submit sample. You                             can visit our safety form: Final Safety Form
R3: Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page                             must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others,                             including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists,                             and commercial services.
E3: Here is our team’s attribution page.
R4: Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project                             related to BioBricks. This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty                             to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
E4: One of the novel functions of our software is the information retrieval function. We integrated                             the team information from 2004 to 2016, and transformed it into the same format. By inputing                             the name of a BioBrick part, the user could get the integrated information of teams related to                             such part. It provides convenience to users in obtaining information and gives them inspiration for research. For more detailed information, you can visit Contribution page.
R1: Convince the judges that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc.) performs                             its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
E1: Unit test and functional test are done to ensure the reliability of our software. We calculated                             the recall ratio, and invited wet team to use our software.
R2: Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful                             way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate                             a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of                             any of these activities.
E2: We gave some technical support to Northeast Forestry University on their wiki, and invited many                             iGEM teams to use our software We tested the software developed by USTC-Software, offering them                             some suggestions and solutions to their bugs. For more detailed information, please visit Collaboration page.
R3: Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe,                             responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local,                             national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys                             will not fulfill this criteria.
E3: We have done the Human Practice. For more detailed information, please visit Human Practice page.
R1: Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated                             issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
E1: We released a VR shooting Game — gene war to popularize iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Wearing VR                             glasses and holding handles, players can experience an amazing and immersed trip in the game                             world and obtain knowledge about Synthetic Biology at the same time. For more detailed information,                             you can visit Integrated Human Practice page.
R2: Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create)                             and display your achievement on your wiki.
E2: We improved the software BioDesigner designed by HFUT-China-2016. For more detailed information,                             you can visit Improve page.
R3: Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you                             have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your                             team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
E3: We used TF-IDF model to excavate the keywords from documents and Latent Dirichlet Allocation                             (LDA) model to classify those documents. We also used Word2Vec to explore the semantic meaning                             for a word and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) to find the latent similarity between documents.                             For more detailed information, you can visit Model page.
R4: Convince the judges that your project works.
