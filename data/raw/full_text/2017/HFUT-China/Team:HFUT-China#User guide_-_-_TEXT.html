We made a video to show users how to operate in our system. This video can be found in "Demonstrate" page
Open your browser and input address http://bio.measurex.top and you will be redirected to our website.
You can find links to pages which have functions mentioned above.
If you want to go back to the main page, “BioDesigner Dolphin” button on the top-left of the page will                     lead you to it.
You can find buttons on the top-right which lead to the functions aforementioned along with the login                     and sign up buttons.

You can type in keywords in the search box on the main page. You can also select multiple tracks under                     the box, which means the system will only search for best matches under these certain tracks. Selecting                     no tracks means searching under all tracks. You will be redirected to another page when the search button                     is clicked, and results will be listed on it.
Search
You can find the search function on the main page. You don’t have to login when using this searching.                     Now, take the page below as an example:

We listed teams which best match the keywords along with their team name, type, keywords, awards, biobricks                     and summarized information. If you are looking for detailed information about a team, you can click on                     the team and the information will be shown.
We split the searching results into many pages in consideration of convenience. What’s more, a list of                     recommended keywords for the next search is provided, and you search for it by clicking on it.
After clicking on a team, you will go to a page like this:
In this page, detailed information are listed.
On the left side of this page, we set an information guide list to provide a direct link to the information                     you want.
Project
Click on the "Project" button, and you will go to this page:
1. Click on the “+” under “Project Editor” to create a project.
2. After creating your project, the name of the project will appear on the top-left on the page.
3. Then click on the “pencil” button under “Project Editor” can let you operate the project. Here create                     two devices for example. Click on the “pencil” again can disable the modification function.
4. Choose “1” under “project_1”, and click on the “Design” button, then you will be redirected to the                     design page.
You can drag biobricks from the left and drop them on the gene chain to assemble a gene chain. You can                     also search for biobricks using the search function located in the top-left of the page.
You can click the left button of your mouse to see the detailed information of biobricks, and the right                     button to choose to delete the biobrick (or drag the biobrick to the garbage can on the bottom-right                     of the page).
5. After designing, click on the “Project” button again, and choose “1” under “project_1”, and you can                     see the gene chain you just designed.
Gene Relationship
1. Click on the “Gene Relationship” button and you will see the page with gene relationships on it. System                     will allocate a gene to you randomly, and show its related genes. Click on any gene circles, and the                     related genes will be shown.
2. Click the left button of the mouse on the line between two genes, and the relationship between them                     will be shown. You also can see literatures or papers which contain this gene. Furthermore, you can get                     papers about this gene at NCBI.
System
1. Click on the “System” and you will see the system recommendation page. You can input keywords about                     chemical compounds at the search box on the top-left. Then you can click “+” at compounds that you are                     interested in.
2. Click on “You Tags”, you will see the compounds you just added. And click the “Run” button, you can                     see a relation graph between them.
Click on the nodes on the canvas, and the corresponding information of genes or compounds will be shown                     on the right. If you want to delete all of the compounds, you can click on “Tag” and then “Delete All”.
