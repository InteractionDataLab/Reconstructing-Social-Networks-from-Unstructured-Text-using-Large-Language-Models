Project Safety
We will use a conversation to prove that our software is safe ~ :)
Q & A
Q1: Who will use your product?
      What opinions do these people have about your project?
A1:Synthetic biologists who want to improve their working efficiency in labs and simplify the preparation procedure of their experiments.
Q2: Where will your product be used?
      On a farm, in a factory, inside human bodies, in the ocean?
A2:We can use the product in the lab.
Q3: If your product is successful, who will receive benefits and who will be harmed?
A3:The researchers whose assignment is scrutinizing large volumes of literature to find useful information for their project will receive benefits if our product is successful. This procedure can be done by our software. However, the software may replace some people`s work, which would lower their salary.
Q4: What happens when it's all used up? Will it be sterilized, discarded, or recycled?
A4:Software will never be used up.
Q5: Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?
A5:According to our investigation, there is currently no other software that aims at literature analysis, which is our new function this year.
Q6: Does your software allow users to submit new data into any public lists or databases?
      If so, do you check the new data for errors before allowing it to be written?
A6:No, we do not allow users to submit new data into any public lists or databases, like ncbi or iGEM website. Users can only submit their data to our own project database.
Q7: Are you using the iGEM Software repository at github.com/igemsoftware?
       If you have instead stored your code elsewhere, please explain where and why you have put it there.
       If your code is not in the iGEM repository, are you using any version control system such as Git, CVS, or SVN?
A7:Because it will be freer for us to design the software. What’s more, we can correct the errors which need specific permission more easily. We will submit the code to the iGEM Github Repository when we are about to accomplish the design progress. We use git as the version controlling system.
Q8: What is the URL or IP address where the user's private data is stored?
       Where is the physical computer or hard drive that contains the user's private data?
A8:When it comes to server, we use Cloud Host provided by safe and reliable host service providers, which are able to offer us security services on both hardware and system level. Unit test and system test will be done to ensure the security of our software.
Q9: What other actions do you take to enhance the security of your software?
A9:We do not open outside visit permission, which means the users’ information in the database can only be accessed locally. For more information, you can refer to our API document.
