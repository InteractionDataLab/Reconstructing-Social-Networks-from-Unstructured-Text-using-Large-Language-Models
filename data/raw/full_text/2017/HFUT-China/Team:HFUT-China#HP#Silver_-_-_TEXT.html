Human Practice
Idea
The main idea of our human practice project is to popularize iGEM and synthetic biology to outsiders. Let people             who have never stepped into synthetic biology get interested in and know about it. Many elements of the human practice game were inspired by the concept of our project--"search". And our human practice project is also an extension of our main project.
Initial plan
At first, we planned to develop a virtual laboratory. We have visited USTC team’s laboratory and let them show             us some professional equipment. Thanks to the enthusiastic receiving of USTC, we documented the equipment’s detailed             appearance and its usage in order to build the virtual model in the VR lab. Moreover, the plan of developing a virtual lab wonders away from our project.
Change of plan
Although we have come up with an excellent plan of the virtual lab, it wonders away from our initial idea. Few             people but biologists know about how to operate in the virtual lab. As for those who has never touched synthetic             biology, it is too difficult to play around in the virtual lab. Thus we would fail to generalize synthetic biology             to the non-professionals if we had kept the VR lab. Finally, we decided to change the plan and to develop a VR             game.
Gene War Game
The name of this game is VR Shooting - Gene War. Players are supposed to control a BioBrick container in their             hands to store gene chains and shoot bullets to attack the enemy in front of them. In the meantime players should             avoid being shot by bullets from enemies. There are a variety of enemies, whose blood volume, flying speed of             bullets, movement patterns and scores are different. In the fifth section, there is a “Final BOSS” which is quite             hard to deal with. A tool aiming at supplying blood for players is set in this game. A large number of BioBricks             are randomly generated around the player. When the BioBricks are touched by the handle, a system which provides             skills to players will start. The system will automatically select a suitable gene chain according to the gene             blocks being touched. To start the game and acquire special skills, player must touch the virtual promoter and             terminator, respectively. If players touch the wrong gene, the gene chains will be overloaded, which means they             are cleared and regenerated. Players are provided with four special skills: explosion (reduce the blood volume             of all enemies), blood supplement (return to full-blood status), no-enemy status and shooting speed acceleration. What's more, players will get extra rewards when they find symbols of "BioDesigner Dolphin".
After players complete the game, their duration time and scores acquired will be ranked on the leaderboard in             the main UI interface. What’s more, to make the game more interesting, there is also a rewarding mechanism. A             searching “magnifier” is randomly generated in the game, and by touching it, the gene chains will be instantly             filled and players can release the current skills.
