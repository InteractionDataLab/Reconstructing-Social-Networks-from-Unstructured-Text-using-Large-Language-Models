Hey there, iGEMers! Are you still looking for information of biobricks? Are you still having difficulty in finding                 references of former teams? Are you still feeling hard to design your biobricks? Don’t worry now,BioDesigner                 Dolphin can do this for you!
Why Biodesigner Dolphin?
First of all, let me tell you a story. Emma who is new to iGEM and her teammates are interested in social behaviors                 of bacteria, and they determined to build a system modeling human society to deal with grease existing in the                 polluted water. What they first thought about was the decomposition of grease. But to enrich their project, they                 wanted to know more about sewage treatment. So, they looked into wikis on the official website under “Environment” track, which was a long and exhausting process, and picked out some projects related to greas. Then it suddenly                 came to their minds that grease could be synthesized to biodiesel, which is typical of “Energy” track. And this                 means they would have to look into wikis again which made them feel really upset.
They thought of getting inspiration from Google. However, when they googled “grease”, they got this：
and this：
I think Emma won’t love Google anymore.
One of the highlights of this year’s BioDesigner Dolphin is that we expanded the teams provided by the official                 and added information retrieval for teams’ wikis. Take Emma and her teammates as an example. They don’t have                 to surf wikis under “Energy” and “Environment” any longer. What they should do is to type “grease” in the searching                 box of BioDesigner Dolphin and they will get what they want.
Furthermore, as a pure iGEM assistant software, BioDesigner Dolphin can provide information which is much cleaner                 and tidier than Google’s. Users don’t have to worry about advertisements and unrelated news. Actually, there                 are many search engines like BioDesigner Dolphin in other fields such as ncbi in medical research and so on. And the                 searching function of BioDesigner Dolphin is a proprietary searching engine designed for wikis of iGEM.
Applications of BioDesigner Dolphin
You are free to search for team and biobrick information. Searching for teams under certain tracks Participants or                 any combination of tracks is also available. You will only be shown teams which are under the selected tracks.                 Selecting no tracks means searching in all teams. What’s more, once a team is chosen, recommended teams, which                 is similar to this one, will appear on the right of the screen. The recommendation is based on how much two teams                 are related according to their content and themes.
Guess what, you will find a big surprise in the design panel of BioDesigner Dolphin, especially for those who have                 problem designing parts. In the designing panel, you can devise your own parts in three steps: Drag, and Drop,                 and Done. Once a part is selected, the detailed information will appear on the right. After a part is set, you                 will get recommended parts that are most likely to be added behind or ahead of this part.
