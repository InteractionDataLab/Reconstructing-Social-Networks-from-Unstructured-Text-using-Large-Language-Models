Xueyao Jiang
Team leader & Developer
I’m the team leader of HFUT-China. I mainly undertake the job of back-end development                                     and deployment of the project. iGEM gives me the chance to have my first try for a lot                                     of things and to be acquainted with my team members. Above all, BioDolphin makes me believe                                     that python is the best programming language ：)
Haoran Sha
Crawler & Background program
I’m so excited to take part in 2017 iGEM with my lovely team members. And I’m the Crawler                                     Man in the team. My main task is to design crawler programs for collecting data from                                     the Internet. It’s a memorable experience to work with my friends. LOVE YOU GUYS! I am                                     Crawler Man!

Wenyun Wang
Algorithm
I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science in HFUT. I am responsible                                     for the recommended algorithm design and data collecting. By the way, this is my first                                     time to take part in iGEM, and I am really happy about it.
Zufeng Ding
Algorithm
I am Zufeng Ding, a student from School of Software in HFUT. I am responsible for algorithm                                     and sometimes meeting recording in our iGEM team. I am grateful for the opportunity to                                     join the contest. In practice, I got to know more about coding and enjoyed spending time                                     working with the team.
Chuanneng Sun
Algorithm and Presentation
It is my great honor to attend 2017 iGEM with these guys. My main tasks are devising                                     algorithms as well as collecting and cleaning data with the others, which needs a lot                                     of brain work. I really cherish this opportunity that we can work together. And all of                                     us devoted much to it. Best wishes to our team.
Lujun Wang
Developer
Hi, guys! I am Lujun Wang and a junior student from School of Software in HFUT. I am                                     mainly in charge of demand survey and association with other teams. I am very happy to                                     join this contest. I believe that we are the best team.
Yue Gu
Human Practice
I am Yue Gu from School of Software in HFUT. I am responsible for realization of some                                     VR models. Through teamwork, I realized the importance of communication. I hope that                                     our team could achieve a good result in the contest!
Haonan Zhou
Human Practice
I am a member of the production team of our VR game: VR Shooting-The Gene War. My main                                     tasks are code implementation, scene construction and 3D modeling. There is no easy path                                     to turn imagination into reality and no one can achieve perfection with a first try.                                     Communication is the key to solve problems. I believe that only when we pay attention                                     to every detail could we make a satisfactory piece of work.
Xinchen Liu
Algorithm
I am Xinchen Liu from School of Software in HFUT. It is my pleasure to take part in 2017                                     iGEM with so many excellent partners. My work focuses on design of algorithms of natural                                     language process and processing codes programming. I am grateful that I can have such                                     a precious opportunity to learn so much about LDA and ML. Best wishes to our team.

I am Yang Liu from School of Software in HFUT. My main job is to develop some of the                                     front-end interfaces. I am very glad to join this group and contribute my own strength                                     to it. And I also benefited a lot from this process.
Kai Tong
Designer
As the designer of our iGEM team, I am very happy working with everyone. While working,                                     I can feel the team power. Though work is trivial, every day is still fulfilling to me.                                     During the process, I learned and tried to apply Axure. But my biggest gain is that I                                     started to know how to work with a team.
