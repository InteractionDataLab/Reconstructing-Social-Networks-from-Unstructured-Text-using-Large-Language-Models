BioDesigner is devised as a software platform whose theme includes genetic engineering and synthetic biology.        The whole system can be described as three parts, which are information retrieval, gene chain designing  BioBricks and popularization of Synthetic Biology.
Information Retrieval
First, we provide great convenience for iGEMers in information retrieval        and reduce the difficulty of getting information which lets participants get familiar with iGEM competition faster:        the original information retrieval function of iGEM can only search the team's wiki by year or team name.        BioDesigner, however, can search the content of team wiki.        We integrated the team information from 2004 to 2016, transformed it into the same format and made classification.        In addition to searching the corresponding wiki through keywords, users can further filter the information based on the classification we give.
At the same time, BioDesigner brings inspiration to iGEMers on BioBricks research:        by using BioDesigner, iGEMers can search for the name of a BioBrick to get the wiki of the team that        has used this BioBrick and looking at what those teams did with the BioBrick.        Therefore, BioDesigner provides research directions and inspiration for iGEMers.
Designing BioBricks
The designing BioBricks section lets users design their own gene chain by simply dragging and dropping BioBricks listed on the left.
In order to help users design highly dependable and qualified gene chains,              recommended BioBricks will also be listed according to the existing BioBricks on the chain.              Visible interface is provided in this part, and the easy operation as well as the friendly environment of it should not be neglected.              With the designing function, participants can be worried no more about designing gene chains.
Popularization of Synthetic Biology
In order to popularize Synthetic Biology and iGEM, we develop a wonderful VR game.              Wearing VR glasses and holding handles, players can experience an amazing and immersed trip in the game world.              The basic idea of the game is collecting BioBricks to form a gene chain.              The whole gene chain will not be accomplished unless BioBricks are collected in a certain order,              which can be interpreted as biological feasibility of the gene chain. Virtual reality is characterized by immersion,              interaction and imagination. Players will obtain knowledge about Synthetic Biology with happiness.
The three parts of our project mentioned above are devised to meet the demand of other teams and provide comprehensive,              convenient and high-quality services. With our system, the threshold of scientific research will lowered,              and Synthetic Biology is consequently further developed.
