Improvement
It is a great honor to attend the 2017 iGEM competition, and this is the fourth time that HFUT-Software attend             the competition. On the one hand, based on the project from last year’s work, we maintained the advantages of             it, and further perfected its user interface and function. On the other hand, to fulfill the variety needs of             users and to provide better services, we added a searching section to the original system, in which users can             search for detailed information and wiki of past teams, and it is also the highlight of our system this year.
First, let’s see the improvement of the previous system. It will be introduced as two parts—User Interface (UI)             and Function.
User Interface
Primarily, we modified the layout of some pages according to the feedbacks from users, in order to offer better             services. For instance, we replaced the former login page, which is unmatched with the basic style of the system,             with a simpler but suitable one. As for the reorganization of the design page, we not only beatify it, but modified             some interactive details. For example, we improved the smoothness of the dragging effect when adding a part to             the gene chain, and we appended “delete” at the menu when the right button of the mouse is pressed. Furthermore,             the trash can of the design page is also changed satisfy the harmony of the whole page.
What's more, in BioDesigner Coral, all of the funcitons require users to login first. But in BioDesigner Dolphin, except for "Project", the other three allow users to use without login.

Function
Secondly, the function of the former system is further perfected. We updated the parts recommendation function             to make it more reasonable. To be specific, suppose we have a gene chain, biobrick A→biobrick B→biobrick C→biobrick             D, and if the biobrick C is chosen, we can get recommended biobricks by clicking the corresponding option which             lies in the menu of the right button. “Recommend→front” means to recommend a part ahead of biobrick C, “recommend→back”             means to recommend a part behind biobrick C, “recommend→middle-front” means to recommend a part in the middle             of biobrick B and biobrick C, and “recommend→middle-back” means to recommend a part in the middle of biobrick             C and biobrick D.
Moreover, a novel function is added to the system—the wiki information retrieval function. Based on the idea             to let participants get familiar with iGEM competition faster, we integrated the team information from 2004 to             2016, and transformed it into the same format. In comparison with the information from the official resources,             users can obtain much more convenient services from our system, while the official information is complex and             might cause confusion to users. And the wiki of each team is of different style, which is hard for other participants             to search for interested information. Thus, it is not only convenience but also great efficiency that our system             can bring to users. What’s more, despite the listed searching results, we also present recommended teams which             are similar to the wanted team.

Having read the introduction of our system, are you now having a strong will to try it? So what are you waiting             for?
