Most of the work was made by the team but we would not come as far as we reached now without some help. We have formed mostly from junior Molecular Biology and Genetics students and we will not be able to achieve that process without assisting. We are glad to take the opportunity to acknowledge, learned to look from different perspectives and troubleshooting with the assistance of the people who formed us. We want to thank them all!
Principle Investigators
Urartu Şeker
Urartu Şeker is a principal investigator at Institute of Material Science and Nanotechnology in the Synthetic Biosystems Lab Group. His main research is the synthetic biology at the Bio-Nano interface. We thank to our main supervisor Asst. Prof. Şeker because of his team spirit to bond us together and always available for our questions. He have made such effort to build that team and has a huge influence on young brains to get involved in scientific projects.
Işık Yuluğ
Işık Yuluğ is a principal investigator at department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in the tumor suppressor genes. Her main research is transcriptional mapping of human chromosomes and molecular genetics and biology of inherited cancers. Assoc. Prof. Işık Yuluğ is the secondary supervisor and was always available for questions and help throughout the project.
Advisor
Musa Efe Işılak
Efe Işılak is a previous iGEM competitor and now doing  a master’s degree at UNAM. We thank to him for listening to us patiently  in our long meetings. He always comes up with solutions and his perspective enables us to learn doing trouble shooting.
Other Teams
Our team is inspired  from 2014 WHU China iGEM team when we are developing our biosensor. They designed the construct, one of the constructs we used. HxlR - pFor duplet to sense formaldehyde which has part number BBa_K1334002. However, when we built our construct from the kit we could not manage to obtain precise induction data. We designed our own HxlR - pFor duplet with a few differences and at the end we obtained positive induction datum. We thank to 2014 WHU China Team in order to improve our project and make us learn how to do troubleshooting.
Others
Recep Erdem Ahan
Recep Erdem Ahan is a MSc student of Asst. Prof. Urartu Şeker. He has a previous iGEM experience from ITU and he was also the supervisor of UNAMBG 2016 Team. He always played as a brain role in our team and always shared his ideas with us.
Nedim Hacıosmanoğlu
Nedim Hacıosmanoğlu is a MSc student of Asst. Prof. Urartu Şeker. He has a previous iGEM experience from ITU and he always shared his experiences with us. He helped us doing our modelling.
Kübra Özvural
Kübra Özvural is a junior student studying Chemistry in the Bilkent University. She designed our minimalist logo. Thanks to her!
Synthetic Biosystems Research Group
We thank to Synthetic Biosystems Research Group for their patience and always being available for our questions. Their different perspectives played a great role in forming our project.
Institute of Material Science and Nanotechnology
We thank to UNAM as they accepted us and treat as we are members of the Institute.
Bilkent University Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics
We thank to to all of our instructors to be available for our questions and fund us to attend to the competition. They also helped to share our survey in their channels.
Bilkent News
Bilkent News reserved a column for our project and explained what we are managing to do. We are thankful for Bilkent News family to spread our ideas through other people by using their newspaper.
Sponsors
We owe a thank to all our sponsors for contributing financially and supplying products necessary for our project. Without help, we would not be able to hold the Synthetic Biology conference and will not be able to obtain laboratory equipments. In this part, we want to introduce our sponsors and how they have helped us.
