Some great ideas had came up. Bacteria that give signal in the presence of methane, bacteria that adjusts acidity levels in stomach, and the bacteria being capable of vitamin synthesis were the good ones. But one day, we noticed that grieved cancer stories were common on the local primetime news. Most patients were complaining the invasiveness of the diagnosis process. And also most of them described it as painful, unpleasant and uncomfortable practices. </P><P>

So we started to search a bio solution for a noninvasive, painless and cheap cancer diagnosis. We interviewed with various patients and medical doctors. What we heard from them became our starting point. According to what we hear from people, a non-invasive method has to be developed. After an extensive article scan, we decided to do this project.</P><P class="quote">‘Early diagnosis is the cornerstone of a successful cancer treatment.
