We tried induction with 0.5 mM and 1 mM formaldehyde and uninduced by using three biological replicas. </P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Figure 1 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 16 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. Voc: formaldehyde.</P><P>The overnight measurement indicates that the error bars are almost equal or more than the fold change of the each induction. This inconsistency can also be seen from the uninduced and 0.5 mM bars. Uninduced bar is almost 5 times more than the induced one. In conclusion, induction of the part Bba_K1334002 with formaldehyde is inconsistent which prompts us to improve this part.</P><H3>HxlR/pFor Sensor Gradient aTc Induction</H3><P>In order to control the expression level of HxlR protein, gradient aTc concentrations are utilized since HxlR gene expression is regulated by the promoter pL(tetO) within the HxlR/pFor sensor. Thus, HxlR protein is produced upon the addition of aTc and the amount of HxlR protein produced is positively correlated with the aTc concentration. </P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Figure 2 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 2 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. “(-)” denotes no addition of formaldehyde and “(+)” denotes 1 mM formaldehyde addition.</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Figure 3 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 4 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. “(-)” denotes no addition of formaldehyde and “(+)” denotes 1 mM formaldehyde addition.</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Figure 4 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) 16 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated. “(-)” denotes no addition of formaldehyde and “(+)” denotes 1 mM formaldehyde addition.</P><P>Gradient aTc induction results illustrated that elevated GFP signal upon the addition of formaldehyde is more significant when aTc concentration is 25 ng/μl.</P><H3>Fluorescent and DIC Equipped Upright Microscope Results</H3><P>After we did our induction, we looked our cells under Fluorescent and DIC Equipped Upright Microscope whether we can observe GFP signal color which is supposed to seen green according to signal rate:</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Image 1. 40x zoom for 25ng/ul aTc concentration of HxlR construct after overnight measurement of  induction.</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Image 2. 40x zoom for 25ng/ul aTc and 1 mM VOC concentration of HxlR construct after overnight measurement of induction.</P><P>As it is seen from the images, comparison between them indicates that addition of VOC increases the green color density which refers that our formaldehyde biosensor is working.</P><H3>HxlR/pFor Sensor Gradient Formaldehyde Induction</H3><P>To determine the concentration of formaldehyde which would facilitate a higher fold change in GFP signal, gradient formaldehyde induction is performed. Since the most appropriate aTc concentration is determined in gradient aTc induction, all samples are initially induced with 25 ng/μl aTc. On the other hand, the least concentrated formaldehyde which provides a sufficient fold change, might be detected by gradient formaldehyde induction.</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size: 0.5em;">Figure 5 : Y axis corresponds to RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit)16 hours after formaldehyde addition and on the X axis sample groups are indicated.
