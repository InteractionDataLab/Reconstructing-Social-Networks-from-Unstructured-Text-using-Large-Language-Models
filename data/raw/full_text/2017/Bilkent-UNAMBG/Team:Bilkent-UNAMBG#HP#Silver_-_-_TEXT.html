For High School Students
While we were continuing our project, we  were excited to introduce our project to people as well. We have emailed schools near to our research center, and got their permission to present our project. We did not only visit schools to present our project, We introduce the area of synthetic biology and our department for the students who may be interested in Molecular Biology. By giving speeches in schools, we wanted them to know how synthetic biology can improve our daily life and make our world better. To familiarize students with the idea, we showed some examples of great synthetic biology works used in daily life.
We talked about Molecular Biology in general and what it is like to be studying Molecular Biology. We told them our experiences in the area so that they can decide thier profession with more knowledge. We had lots of fun while preparing presentations and while presenting them. We even had a chance to look at our project from a high school student’s point of view while answering questions.
