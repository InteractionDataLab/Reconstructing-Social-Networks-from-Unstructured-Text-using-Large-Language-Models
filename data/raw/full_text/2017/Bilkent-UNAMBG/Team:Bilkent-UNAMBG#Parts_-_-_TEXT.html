BBa_K2234011
Regulatory
AlkR-pAlkB from Acinetobacter baylyi: AlkR is the regulatory protein of Alk operon in Acinetobacter baylyi. This operon is responsible for mid-long chain alkane degredation. It activates the promoter of AlkB gene, named pAlkB.
1274
BBa_K2234012
Regulatory
HxlR- pFor from Bacillus Subtilis: HxlR is a regulatory protein from Bacillus subtilis that controls a formaldehyde sensitive operon. This part includes HxlR CDS and the promoter it regulates.

BBa_K2234022
Device
Cyclohexanone Sensor: produces with respect to cyclohexanone.
2298
BBa_K2234023
Composite
pChnB-sfGFP: produces sfGFP with respect to cyclohexanone.
1152
BBa_K2234024
Device
AlkR-pAlkB based long-mid chain alkane sensor: AlkR is the regulatory protein of Alk operon in Acinetobacter baylyi. This operon is responsible for mid-long chain alkane degredation. It activates the promoter of AlkB gene, named pAlkB. This part consists of AlkR CDS under a ATC inducible promoter and sfGFP under a AlkR regulated promoter.
2058
BBa_K2234025
Device
HxlR-pFor based formaldehyde sensor 1.1: HxlR is a regulatory protein from Bacillus subtilis that controls a formaldehyde sensitive operon. This part consists of HxlR under a ATC inducible promoter and sfGFP under a HxlR regulated promoter.
1431
BBa_K2234026
Device
MimR-pmimA based acetone sensor: MimR is under the control of a ATC inducible promoter. MimR activates transcription from pMimA promoter when acetone is present. Activated promoter results in sfGFP production.
