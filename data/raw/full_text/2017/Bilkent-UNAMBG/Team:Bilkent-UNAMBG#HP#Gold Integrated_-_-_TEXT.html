At the very beginning of our journey, we intensively brainstormed upon issues which we can solve by synthetic biology based on standard parts. Some great ideas had came up. Bacteria that give signal in the presence of methane, bacteria that adjusts acidity levels in stomach, and the bacteria being capable of vitamin synthesis were the good ones. But one day, we noticed that grieved cancer stories were common on the local primetime news. Most patients were complaining the invasiveness of the diagnosis process. And also most of them described it as painful, unpleasant and uncomfortable practices.
So we started to search a bio solution for a noninvasive, painless and cheap cancer diagnosis. We interviewed with various patients and medical doctors. What we heard from them became our starting point. According to what we hear from people, a non-invasive method has to be developed. After an extensive article scan, we decided to do this project.
‘Early diagnosis is the cornerstone of a successful cancer treatment. A kit based on the detection of volatile organic molecules can indeed change cancer statistics, especially in developing countries. Many patients are hindering their routine checks because they find the traditional diagnostic methods uncomfortable.’

‘An alive cancer sensor can ease the diagnosis process for medical personnel. It may be possible to see ahead quickly by the breath test without waiting for conventional assays’ results and appointment crowd of an hospital. Thus, patient lives can normalise in a shorter span of time.’
