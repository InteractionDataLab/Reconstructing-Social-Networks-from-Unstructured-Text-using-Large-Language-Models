Collaboration with iGEM Chalmers Gothenbourg
In July, requested for help from team iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg.Although we have some experience with using MATLAB, we are not modelling experts. We wanted to model our biosensor for detecting VOCs. Therefore, iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg provided support through skype-meetings. Together with iGEM Chalmers-Gothenburg, we conducted a survey covering the public opinion about a mass screening program in both Turkey and Sweden. The results from each country could then be compared to analyze differences in the public opinion about mass screening strategies and how this should be financed. The results of the survey can be found here .
