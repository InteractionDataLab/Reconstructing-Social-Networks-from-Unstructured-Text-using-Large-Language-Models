We have formed mostly from junior Molecular Biology and Genetics students and we will not be able to achieve that process without assisting. We are glad to take the opportunity to acknowledge, learned to look from different perspectives and troubleshooting with the assistance of the people who formed us. We want to thank them all!

Efe Işılak is a previous iGEM competitor and now doing  a master’s degree at UNAM. We thank to him for listening to us patiently  in our long meetings. He always comes up with solutions and his perspective enables us to learn doing trouble shooting. </P><H3>Other Teams</H3><P>
Our team is inspired  from 2014 WHU China iGEM team when we are developing our biosensor. They designed the construct, one of the constructs we used. HxlR - pFor duplet to sense formaldehyde which has part number BBa_K1334002. However, when we built our construct from the kit we could not manage to obtain precise induction data. We designed our own HxlR - pFor duplet with a few differences and at the end we obtained positive induction datum. We thank to 2014 WHU China Team in order to improve our project and make us learn how to do troubleshooting.</P><H3>Others</H3><P><B>Recep Erdem Ahan</B>
