Team VesiCure participated in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. The InterLab experiment aims to improve the measurement tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole by comparing GFP fluorescence in different labs using the same protocol, as established by iGEM headquarters. Our results were formally submitted and are summarized in our notebook below.
Results and Conclusions
As anticipated, our log-scale calibration curve was close to linear. The curve on the linear-scale curve (Figure 1) most likely indicates errors in pipetting, which will be accounted for by the iGEM measurement committee.
