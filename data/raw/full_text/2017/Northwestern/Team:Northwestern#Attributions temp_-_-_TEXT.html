We wholeheartedly thank all of the following individuals and institutions for their interest and contributions to the development of the "ENTER NAME". Their contributions to the project are commendable and we thank them for expanding pur sythetic biology toolbox
This years project was a continuation of 2016's iGEM project. We thank the 2016 members for their contribution and providing the springboard for us to make more headway
All lab work was completed on the Northwestern University Evanston campus by the members of Northwestern iGEM 2017 unless otherwise noted.
General Support
Our faculty advisers Dr.Joshua Leonard, Dr.Keith Tyo, and Dr. Danielle Tullman-Ereck talked us through our tedious brainstorming process and guided us as we worked towards our project vision. They also helped the iGEM members obtain grants for living in Evanston during the summer.
Our outstanding graduate student advisors Bradley Biggs, Chelsea (wong?), Bon Iguwasku, Patrick Donahue, and Peter Su , donated time to discuss our project with us and guide us through our lab experience. They also taught us various basic lab techniques, safety, and aided us in our independent work
Dr. John Mordacq, lab director and professor of Northwestern University’s Program in Biological Sciences, obligingly accommodated us with a lab space and necessary equipment for our summer experience

Technique and Troubleshooting
Thank you to all of the graduate students of the Leonard, Tyo, Jewett, and Bagheri labs who jumped on board to talk to us about our project and help us over the summer!
Bon Igwausku met with us almost every day to talk to us about our project progress and troubleshooting. Additionally, he came to our meetings and offed words of encouragement and recommendation.

Dr. Matthew DeLisa from Cornell University provided us with a hypervesicular strain of E. coli (JC8031) and a His-ClyA-GFP plasmid. The hypervesicular strain is sourced (with permission) from the lab of Dr. Roland Lloubes from the Institute of Microbiology of the Mediterranean.
The lab of Dr. Feng Zhang from the Broad Institute provided us with a plasmid for S. pyogenes Cas9.
Additional Support
Thank you to Dr. Danielle Tullman-Ercek, who advised us on effective periplasm-directing translocation pathways to utilize in our device construction.
Dr. London and Dr. Mendelson donated their time to answer our questions about the ethical administration of antibiotics despite high public demand for these drugs for our human practices research. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us.

Team Roles
Our team emphasizes the integration of skills in all aspect of the CRISPR Capsules project. From wet lab work to speaking at public events, each team member has experience in all fields. Though some of us certainly deem ourselves “specialized” in some tasks, we find that the overall contribution from the high-level development of the project to the technical details of lab troubleshooting constitutes efforts from each member of the team.
