Center for talent development
Northwestern holds academic enrichment camps, “Center for Talent Development (CTD)”, throughout the summer for K-12 grades. We got in touch with the teachers involved in CTD and made a presentation for a high school biotechnology class. Our team made a PowerPoint slide highlighting the basics of CRISPR/Cas9 and OMVs in relation to our project. Additionally, we created a jeopardy game at the end of the presentation to further engage the students.
Generally, the students seemed engaged and interested in our presentation. We noticed visible excitement when we talked about the future potential of genetic engineering, such as “designer babies” or making “super humans”.  Our results (see below: figure 3 and figure 4) from the pre and post survey of the activity show that overall, student’s knowledge of CRISPR/Cas9 increased as well as their interest in pursuing a career/higher education in science. The interest in wet lab work remained relatively the same.
