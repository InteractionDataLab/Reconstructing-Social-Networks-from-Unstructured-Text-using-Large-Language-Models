Lab practices
Our lab was a certified Biological Saftey Level 1 laboratory handling non-pathogenic organisms. We strove to follow standard microbiological practices and chemical procedures and protocols. Every wet-lab experiment was preformed wearing proper PPE (gloves, goggles, lab coats). All of our members received training covering: emergency procedures, disinfection,  sterilization, chemicals, fire and electrical safety etc. in June 2017.
