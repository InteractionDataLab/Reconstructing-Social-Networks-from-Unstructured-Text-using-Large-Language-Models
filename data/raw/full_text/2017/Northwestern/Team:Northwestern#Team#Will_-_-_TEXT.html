I am a second-year electrical engineering student interested in everything STEM related. Although I work in an astrophysics lab on campus, I’m excited to pursue my interest in synthetic biology and its applications through iGEM 2017. When I’m not working, I spend my time building rockets, beating my friends in FIFA, and rewatching the American Pie movies.
