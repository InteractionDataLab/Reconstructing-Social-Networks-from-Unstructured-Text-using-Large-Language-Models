Guide to the future
To gain a broader perspective of our research and itâ€™s place in the world, we used tools from the iGEM Guide to the Future website. SYNERGENE has compiled a list of activities to make iGEMers around the world think about ways their project might influence society as a whole. These tools allowed our team to identify the stakeholders and debate the positive and negative outcomes that this therapeutic could bring forward.
