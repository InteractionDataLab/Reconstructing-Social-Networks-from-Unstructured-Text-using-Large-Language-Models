Ayesha Rahman
I’m a junior studying Biomedical Engineering. I have had very little wet lab experience coming into iGEM, but I am always up for the challenge and excited to get my feet wet (see what I did there?). Genetic engineering fascinates me and I’m ready to take part in furthering the field. I’m from Chicago, born and bred, something I almost never fail to mention.When I find free time, I like to take pictures, watch Christopher Nolan movies, listen to rap and exploring the city.
