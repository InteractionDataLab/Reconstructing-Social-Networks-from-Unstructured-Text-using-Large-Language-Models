Team VesiCure collaborated with iGEM teams around the world by answering surveys, exchanging protocols  and participating in an international effort to spread awareness and make synthetic biology more popular.
Oxford University collaboration
The University of Oxford iGEM team also spent the summer working with outer membrane vesicles and constructing fusion peptides. By Skyping with their team, we discussed protocols on methods of purifying OMVs and exchanged ideas about mathematical modeling translocation pathways, protein size considerations for export and periplasmic targeting.
