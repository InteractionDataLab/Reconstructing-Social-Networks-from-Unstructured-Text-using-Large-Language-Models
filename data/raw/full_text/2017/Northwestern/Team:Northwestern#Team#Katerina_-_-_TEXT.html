Katerina Cheronis
I am a fourth-year Biomedical Engineering student hoping to pursue medical school following graduation. Having grown up in Athens, Greece scientific terminology does not intimidate me, although I still struggle to pronounce the most obscure names of bacteria. I am currently involved in imaging research for cancer diagnostics, but recently became fascinated by the field of synthetic biology and by how we can engineer bacteria to do the unimaginable. When not in lab, I’m probably reading mystery novels, solving Rubik’s cube puzzles or trying to improve my tennis serve.
