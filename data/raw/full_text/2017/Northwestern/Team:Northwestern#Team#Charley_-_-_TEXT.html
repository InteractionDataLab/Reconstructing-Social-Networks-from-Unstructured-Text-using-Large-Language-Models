Charley Rees
If you need any proof that irony is a fickle mistress, Charley is a local Evanston townie who grew up making fun of nerdy NU students. As a Wildcat, she spends her days as a mechanical engineering student who loves math and building things. Some of her many eclectic interests include product design, hydroponics, manufacturing, renewable energy, and why people are interested in the Kardashians. When Charley is not doing STEM related activities, you can find her at the beach, a Will Ferrel Movie, or doing a cheesy 90â€™s workout video.
