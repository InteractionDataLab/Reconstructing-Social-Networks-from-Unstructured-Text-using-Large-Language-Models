Jack Arnold
I am a third year undergraduate majoring in Chemical Engineering and pursuing a minor in chemistry and biotechnology. I have had little research experience thus far, but I am excited about expanding my skills as part of Northwesternâ€™s 2017 iGEM team. I plan to start research in a lab during fall quarter 2017, and plan to eventually pursue my PhD in chemical engineering with an emphasis on synthetic biology. My interests include rock climbing, photography, and baking various desserts that will knock your socks off. (I also like eating dinosaur egg oatmeal in the wilderness ^^).
