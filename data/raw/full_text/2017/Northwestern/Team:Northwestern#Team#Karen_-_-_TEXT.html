I’m a second-year chemical engineering student that will hopefully end up with a master’s in biotechnology. My first and last exposure to biology was in freshman year AP biology, but that was all I needed to dedicate my life to synthetic biology. I believe the key to healthcare is through genes, and I’ll be darned if I don’t find it. When I’m not struggling to understand things in the lab, I’m producing music for my brother’s friends, watching documentaries, or skyping my 4 pets/kids..
