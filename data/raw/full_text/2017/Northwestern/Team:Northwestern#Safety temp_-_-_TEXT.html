Saftey
Science innovation comes from the intersection of practical and theoretical application. Scientists have to consider the ethical implications of their work when solving the issues of today.
The 2017 NU iGEM team made safety a priority throughout the experience and considered ethics, public safety, and risks.
Safety concerns
In addition to completing iGEM's safety requirements through boot-camp training, every member of our team also had to go through Northwestern's safety modules, NSIS. Our team received safety advice from our professors and graduate students throughout our summer process. A variety of safety issues arise when considering packaging applications of genome editing proteins.
Cas9 issues
Off target effects are always a concern when working with gene editing. Undesirable DNA cleavage can cause fatal effects for a cell and negate the efficacy of treatment. However, the usage of OMV transport reduces off target effects as it ensures that uptake will only occur within a bacterial cell. Additionally, OMVs are preferable over viral transport due to OMVs ability to deliver whole proteins. Whole proteins are not incorporated in the host cell's genome, thereby minimizing off target risks.
Effective design of guide RNA (gRNA) will also minimize off target effects.
OMV Pathogenicity
Our team worried about potential adverse immune effects to a treatment formed from bacterial membranes. However, research has shown that the surface of OMVs can be modified with proteins so that it is not deleterious to mammalian immune systems 1 .
Malicious Intent
After our meeting with Special Agent Scott Maloch , the grim potential of biological terrorism came on our radar. Although our team aims to use OMVs to deliver therapies, they have the potential to deliver harmful chemicals in the body.
Real World Applications
Our treatment is designed to be an aid to conventional antibiotic treatment. Its usage is both relevant nationally and internationally as long as proper production, storage, and transportation guides are followed.
Safe Laboratory Practice
Our lab was a certified Biological Saftey Level 1 laboratory handling non-pathogenic organisms. We strove to follow standard microbiological practices and chemical procedures and protocols. Every wet-lab experiment was preformed with researchers wearing proper PPE and sterile  conditions.
