I’m a senior studying chemical engineering and pursuing a minor in biotechnology. My interest in research began after entering a biomedical research lab for the first time at the age of six (possibly illegally), on a trip with my mom to pick up my dad after work. After around 6 summers of derailing graduate students’ research on occasion, I’ve found my place in iGEM. I’m excited to see what research is ‘Really About’ and experience the inner workings of the entire research design process.   When I am able to escape tech, I can be found stuffing myself with ramen, taking creeper shots of dogs, and drinking copious amounts of milk tea.
