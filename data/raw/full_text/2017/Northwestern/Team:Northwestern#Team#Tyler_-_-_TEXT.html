Tyler Kramlich
I am a junior majoring in Chemical Engineering and Music Composition, and most of my research experience before iGEM was actually concentrated in ethnomusicology.  Even though I grew up in both Sweden and Germany, I went to Northwestern because of my interest in their Dual Degree program.  I have always been fascinated with research at the intersection of chemistry and biology, and I hope to one day obtain my PhD in a related field.
