            I am second year survivor and my name is Desislava Popova!
            In Bulgaria team I implement function of team leader and administrator.
            If you ask me why I like iGEM..it will take us a long time…so long short version was that I didn’t know anything in the beginning. Unexpectedly I discover world of synthetic biology and It wasn’t more that I ever imagine! It helped me grow not only in the field of biology but as a person.
            If you ask me why I did it I again.. I think I am pinch of sarcasm a little bit of masochist  with a pervert sense of biology.
            Other than that I define myself like passionate manga reader and anime fan!
            I hope we meet in the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

            Hello, I  am excited to be part of the second Bulgarian iGEM team, even remotely!!!
            I have obtained a BSc in Molecular Biology from Sofia University “St. Kliment Ohridski” (Bulgaria) and an MSc in Medical Biotechnologies from Wageningen University (The Netherlands). My journeys in the molecular biology and protein expression field began during my Master Thesis project and continue ever since.  I am currently an R&amp;D Scientist in a new product development group in one of the leading biotech companies in the world.  I love being on the frontline of the innovations and the work that allow us to advance science to levels never seen before.
