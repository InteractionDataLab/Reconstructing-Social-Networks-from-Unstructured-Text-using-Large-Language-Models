Fission festival 21.04.2017
Fission is an international science fair made by students of the American College of Sofia. The fair offers a chance for students to explore the scientific field beyond the classroom thanks to workshops and lectures held by scientist from prominent universities. This festival was held at the American College of Sofia where our team demonstrated an electrophoresis and explained its working mechanism, displayed different microscope slides, and briefed the students into the field of synthetic biology.
