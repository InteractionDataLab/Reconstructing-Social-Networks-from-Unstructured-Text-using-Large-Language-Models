Project Vyara
Vyara is a genetics student at University of Glasgow and another example of how inspiring we at iGEM Bulgaria can be. She showed a great deal of interest in the work of iGEM and the team behind it. Vyara sees iGEM not only as an opportunity for personal career growth but also as a step towards achieving her ambition to succeed in Bulgaria and contribute to the development of science in her home country. We gave her the opportunity to gain first-hand experience in the stages through which a project is created, i.e. from the scientific part and social campaigning, to raising funds and administrative work. It is safe to say we piqued her curiosity and she was left impressed by the model of the competition. Vyara shared with us her desire to one day help with the development of young, motivated and qualified people from our country.
