Sofia science festival 22.05.2017
It was a big social event at the Sofia Tech Park where a lot of children participated. We made presentations of our project and organized a workshop. We managed to show them DNA trough gel electrophoresis and show them the unique world of bacteria thanks to our microscopes. Through interesting assignments we managed to let them practice their newly found knowledge.
