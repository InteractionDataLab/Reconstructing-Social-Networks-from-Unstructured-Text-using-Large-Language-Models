“I, engineer” 06.04.2017
“I, engineer” was a social event at the Inter Expo Center featuring startups, lectures and competitions in the engineering field.  A lecture was held by our team captain Desislava Popova and instructor Slavil Peykov. They talked about the iGEM‘s leading projects and about the iGEM competition itself. We explained what iGEM is, what we’re doing, and what our goals are. We also gave a presentation on synthetic biology, aiming to evoke the interest of young people through explaining how the seemingly complicated science is affecting their own lives.
