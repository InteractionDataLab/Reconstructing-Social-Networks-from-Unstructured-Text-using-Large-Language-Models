Agar Art - Bulgaria
This year for a second time there was an Agar art competition held in Bulgaria. It was organized by BG Science Magazine and RIDACOM. The competition was about drawing with microorganisms on petri dish. Among the great number of participants and all their beautiful drawings our team leader Desislava Popova and her Octopus drawing won FIRST place in the competition. The awards were: necklace, a bank of growth medium (yeah!) and a cover photo for the latest issue.
First place in the competition Agar Art – Desislava Popova, iGEM Bulgaria 2017 for her work “Octopus”
