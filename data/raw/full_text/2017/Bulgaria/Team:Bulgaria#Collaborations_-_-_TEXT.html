Collaboration for silver medal
When we met so many difficulties with the site-specific genomic integration via the pOSIP plasmid collection, we looked for a possible collaboration partners among the other iGEM teams. We found the Edinburgh UG iGEM 2017 (SMORE). Our new friends were so kind to help us with sending new constructs for use in our genomic integration efforts. We obtained the Serine Integrase Bxb1 under T7 promoter and the recombineering plasmids pSIM7 and pSIM9, so now we have the so needed alternative methods of chromosomal integration in E. coli. We were able to help the SMORE team back with their human practices. To do so, we found students and engineers to answer their detailed skill-exchange questionnaire, giving a better understanding of communication between biologists and engineers.

Other collaborations
We participated in number of iGEM surveys in order to exchange both knowledge and experience.
One of the first surveys we took part in was submitted by the Minnesota team. It was a Biological Safety Collaboration Survey. The team was doing a booklet on different safety systems that they used to ensure the safety of the synthetic biology systems they were working on. They provided us with a form which we filled with our answers on topics such as potential hazards of our project and what precautions we are going to be put in place to avoid them. This survey was very useful and could help everyone considering a hypothetical release of GMOs in the future.
The UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team kindly sent us another survey which was also very interesting. It was about reducing methane emissions from cows. They were interested in what degree were we familiar with this problem and what are the ways it could be avoided. We filled the 10 questions hoping we contributed to their cause.
Our next filled survey was about Directed Evolution and Artificial Intelligence by the Heidelberg iGEM team. They wanted our opinion on different questions regarding their project. We found them very interesting and innovative. Our general opinion was in support of the directed evolution and artificial intelligence.
