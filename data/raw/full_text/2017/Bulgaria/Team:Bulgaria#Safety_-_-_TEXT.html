Collaborations Safety Attributions
- Who will use your product?
- Lab workers, scientists and students interested in in vivo random mutagenesis.
- Where will your product be used?
- Our system is planned to be used only in a lab environment.
- Is it safer, cheaper, or better than other technologies that do the same thing?
- Our strain is somehow similar to the Xl-1 Red but it definitely would be cheaper. Once obtained, out strain can be propagated in contrast to its commercial alternative. In addition you can control the mutagenesis via adding an inductor.
Used organism strains
- Escherichia coli - DH5α strain
- Escherichia coli - TOP10 strain
- Jun Lab strain (Addgene)
Potential risks
Our project poses the typical risks of working with a level 1 GMO.
Waste treatment
All biological materials or equipment that was used for handling are collected separately and autoclaved.
Emergency reaction:
If lab coats or clothes start burning - emergency showers.
If acids or other harmful liquids get into the eyes - eye showers.
If injuries occurred, treat them with first aid-kits, report the injury, and go to the hospital if necessary.
If solutions with GMO is running down the bench swap it and disinfect the place with NaClO (Belina)
Protective equipment
- Skin protection
- Eye protection
- Lab coats
- Safety glasses in special areas of the lab (should be used in other areas if necessary)
Other rules:
Do not work alone. There should be at least one person in the lab with you.
Do not pipette with your mouth.
Disinfect hands after contamination with GMOs.
Disinfect hands and wash them after working in the lab.
Do not eat, swallow, wash and snore with any chemicals.
Do not bring food, drinks, pets and snacks in the lab.
Be sure that you have informed the instructor of the next step of the experiment plan and gotten the permission of him.
Record the general nature of the work clearly in your lab journal.
