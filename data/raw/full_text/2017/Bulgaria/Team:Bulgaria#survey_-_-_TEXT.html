Survey
At the TechPark  we showed the public a part of our project and a couple of eye-catching experiments to spark the inner scientist in the younger audience. We also conducted a survey which had as a goal to understand how much Bulgarians are familiar with the synthetic biology field.
Everybody at this event knew about bacteria.
Synthetic biology is an unknown field to many.
