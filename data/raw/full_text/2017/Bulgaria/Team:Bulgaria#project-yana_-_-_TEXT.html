Project Yana
Yana is an ambitious young student at the American College of Sofia. We met her during one of our social events and it didn’t take long to notice her interest and desire to work in the field of science. Unfortunately, the lack of career opportunities in Bulgaria can often be disheartening even to the keenest enthusiasts. We decided to invite her to our laboratory and give her the opportunity to work on her own project with the support of other members of our team. She was extremely impressed by the facility, the level of work and more than anything by the tight-knit community that is iGEM Bulgaria. We are absolutely delighted to have been able to spark her interest and would love to one day welcome a person with such potential and desire to work in the field of synthetic biology to our ever-expanding iGEM family.
