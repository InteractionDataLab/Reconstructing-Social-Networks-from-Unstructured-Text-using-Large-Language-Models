Human Practices Silver
Primum non nocere
The motto of our Silver Human Practices campaign was one of the main bioethical principles - "Primum non nocere" ("First, do no harm"). In order to determine if our ACE OF BASE project is safe and responsible, we firs presented it in front of the Head of Genetics and Genomics Department in the University of Sofia. Having his positive comments, we got in touch with The Ministry of Environment and Water (they are responsible for all GMO issues here in Bulgaria). We started a collaboration with an inspector there and presented our project to him. Then he came on a special visit and personally checked all our working areas and protocols. It turn out that he is also a protein engineer with serious experience in different directed evolution strategies. So he was able to give us valuable recommendations and to reassure us that our project will do no harm to the environment if we work as requested by the rules.
Give a hand
The second part of our human practices was concentrated on giving a hand to young scientists. The opportunities for a lab internship here in Bulgaria are quite limited, so we  gave a chance to two young ladies (Vyara and Yana) to join the team and work with us without being part of iGEM Bulgaria 2017. They both did a great job and helped us with our projects. The have separated pages in our Wiki where you can see more info about them and what they did with our iGEM team.
