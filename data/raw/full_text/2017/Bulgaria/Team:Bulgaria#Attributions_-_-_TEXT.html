iGEM Bulgaria Team 2017
iGEM Bulgaria team members - all iGEM student members participated actively in the project design. Most of the lab work for both projects was done by them (some exceptions are described below). iGEM students were engaged in all social campaigns and activities described in this wiki. All project proposals and requests for financial support were initially written by the students. The wiki text was written by all students and all photos used are selected by them.
Team captain – our captain (Desislava Popova) is a member of the Board of directors of the iGEM Bulgaria nonprofit organization. She was additionally responsible for all our financial transactions and for our communication with different companies and organizations (except for Addgene). Our captain was the official face of the team and participated in number of interviews for different mediums. Desislava was also an important part in every project proposal and grant writing process.
Vyara Ganeva - as part of our social campaign Vyara helped the team with lab work in the initial stage of construct assembly and protocol optimization.
Yana Al-Hebri – as part of our social campaign Yana helped us a lot with proofreading the texts for our Wiki and for different grant and project proposals.
Instructors
Dr. Borislav Kirov – Dr. Kirov is the head of the iGEM Bulgaria nonprofit organization. He took care for all administrative issues regarding the iGEM laboratory. The communication with our hosts from Sofia Tech Park was carried out by him. He also participated in some of our social campaigns and convinced most of the other engineers to help us. Dr. Kirov was also important part in different project discussions and he took part in the wiki work with proofreading our texts.
Dr. Slavil Peykov – Dr. Peykov is a member of the Board of directors of the iGEM Bulgaria nonprofit organization. He was responsible for the lab supervision of the team. He participated actively in the project design and took care for the fine tuning of the gene engineering experiments (final approval of the primer design, choice of optimal cloning strategy and so on). Dr. Peykov did single demonstrations for every protocol used by the team. He was also responsible for all Addgene orders and participated in number of social event and campaigns. Dr. Peykov participated in the Wiki writing, project proposals writing and in the final presentation preparation.
Advisors
Maya Yovcheva – Maya works as Cell Biology Scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific. She supported the team with different kits, enzymes, LB media, other consumables and basic materials (everything we used from Thermo Fisher Scientific was delivered thanks to her). She also helped us with the preparation of our presentation for the Giant Jamboree.
Additional help
Prof. Vasil Galabov – Prof. Galabov is the head of the BioInfoTech lab (part of the Sofia Tech Park) that hosted the iGEM Bulgaria 2016 and 2017 teams. He also helped us a lot with design and building of lab equipment for our needs. He created the big blue-orange LED device for our optogenetically driven ROS induced mutagenesis approach.
Alex and Kamelia – Alex and Kamelia are the 3D printer specialists at the BioInfoTech laboratory. They helped our team with various 3D printing experiments like creation of electrophoresis equipment in different sizes. Alex and Kamelia also designed and built the portable blue LED device for our optogenetically driven ROS induced mutagenesis approach.
Yumit Ismailov – Yumit is a volunteer who helped us a lot with our Wiki. He did all the coding and the initial text plus photo upload.
