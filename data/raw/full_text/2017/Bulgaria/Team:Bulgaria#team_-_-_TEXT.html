Desislava Popova
Hi, iGEMers,             I am second year survivor and my name is Desislava Popova!             In Bulgaria team I implement function of team leader and administrator.             If you ask me why I like iGEM..it will take us a long time…so long short version was that I didn’t know anything in the beginning. Unexpectedly I discover world of synthetic biology and It wasn’t more that I ever imagine! It helped me grow not only in the field of biology but as a person.             If you ask me why I did it I again.. I think I am pinch of sarcasm a little bit of masochist  with a pervert sense of biology.             Other than that I define myself like passionate manga reader and anime fan!             I hope we meet in the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
Interests, hobbies, leisure time:
My passion is genetic engineering and synthetic biology and more precisely namely innovation and ingenuity that these studies provide - the ability to conquer the world through science.
Favourite lab equipment:
Microscope.
