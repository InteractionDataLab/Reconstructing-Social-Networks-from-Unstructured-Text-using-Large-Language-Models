Submitted parts
This year iGEM Bulgaria have submitted four new parts:
- gRNA expression vector for use with Cas9 or dCas9 - this part was created for gRNA expression in E. coli. To clone gRNAS into this vector you will need the Eco31I restriction enzyme. Each gRNA will require 2 oligos for cloning. Important: do not transfer this gRNA clonning cassette into pSB1A3! It will not function properly there since the beta-lactamase gene contains targen site for Eco31I.
- KillerOrange CDS - this is the coding sequence of KillerOrange. It was synthesized as a gBlock fragment by IDT. 5' end was codon optimized in order to remove a stable secondary structure that can affect primer design there.
- Mini Singlet Oxygen Generator (miniSOG) CDS - this is the coding sequence of miniSOG. This optical ROS generator is widely used due to its small sequence.
- Inverted INPUT TetR generator - this part is a modified and improved version of part BBa_K145201. Our new part has TetR with no protein degradation tag and moreover the entire part is inverted. This allows more strict control over a downstream Ptet promoter (especially on a high copy number vectors).
