Lab & Modelling Support
Dr Louise Brown - Organised and recruited the iGEM 2017 team at Macquarie. Handled our budgeting for the team, organising many sponsorship opportunities and steered us in the right direction on where our human practices should be headed.
Professor Robert Willows – Designed all the individual parts for our project and assisted us in complex laboratory techniques. Was an invaluable resource for any knowledge we required on all things related to our project and gave assistance in the modelling of our project.
Dr Edward Moh – Provided supervision and advisement to the team in the lab. Also provided helpful motivation to complete our project, and answered any questions we had on laboratory techniques or scientific concepts.
Dr Paul Jaschke – Gave advisement for experimental design and support towards the team. Assisted us in getting a place to present at the Synthetic Biology Australasia conference.
Michael Gibbs - Ran the iGEM boot camp getting us on track for success and supervised lab work, answering any questions we had while providing emotional support during stressful periods in the lab.
Thi Huynh – Gave constant support and laboratory resources while supervising and giving up her time for our team. Without her guidance our project would have been impossible.
Dominic Logel – Helped to oversee our team to guide us to the finish line in Boston with his firsthand experience of the iGEM competition.
Dr. Howard Lovatt, Team Leader of Electrical Machines at CSIRO - gave us feedback on our project, and advice on where our project may lead in the future.
