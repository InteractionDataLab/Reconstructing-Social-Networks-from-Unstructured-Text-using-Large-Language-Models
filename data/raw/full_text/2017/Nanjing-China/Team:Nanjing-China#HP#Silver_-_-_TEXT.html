In addition to the experimental part, we dedicate to  connecting our achievements with society.
In  April, we were invited by iGEM team in Nanjing Agricultural University to  attend a seminar, discussing the technology of synthetic biology and joining in  the professional lecture delivered by Professor Zhang Haoqian.
 
On 20th May 2017, we were honored to hold a great meeting themed on synthetic biology communication. We invited teams from seven top ranking universities in China, including Tsinghua,Tsinghua-A,SJTU, TJU,Tianjin and so on. We discussed how to enhance the cooperation and communication among teams in China. We also talked about several challenges that we encountered during the program.Meanwhile, we invited them to our labortory and introduced our advanced facilites to them. At the end of the meeting, all of us broadened our horizons and learned a lot from each other. Thanks to this meeting, the coperation of iGEM teams in China became more integated.
 
From 26th Aug to 28th Aug, the 4th CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community) was host in Fuzhou. Our team was honored to be invited. 49 iGem teams in China attend the meeting, and we had heated discussion about synthetic biology with each other. During the meeting, we demonstrated our project, from the design to the preliminary results. iGEMers from other teams spoke highly of our project, and they also put forward some constructive suggestions. We took their advice and tried to improve our project. We were happy to make friends with some iGEMers and we stayed in contact with each other even after the meeting, which contributes to integrated collaboration. CCiC is really a big event for iGEMers in China.
 
✎A questionnaire survey has also been  done to collect public ideas about our project.
We designed a questionnaire of the public opinions about the interior decoration air pollution caused by formaldehyde, which inspires us searching a better solution to it and making further progress.
Please go to the questionnaire page to see more information.
 
☣To meet the requirement of biosafty . We visited  AddiseoÒ (Blue Star ADISSEO Company) and investigated into the gas safety issue. What's more, we interviewed a chemistry professor, Yan Zhang to seek for advice to improve our design.
