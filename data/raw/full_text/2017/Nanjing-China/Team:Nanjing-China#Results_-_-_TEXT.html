In the part of lab work, we have designed three biosensor sequences and improved an old part, BBa_J23100. What's more, all the three designs have been demonstrated by us.
 
As  is shown in figure1, the whole sequence of our formaldehyde pathway is about 1500 base-pairs while the  vector is 2000 base-pairs. SDS-PAGE analysis(figure 2) also shows the expression of the  regulator, protein FRMR, around 15kd. Therefore, we moved forward to further  property study.

Figure3 illustrates the fluorescence intensity change induced by formaldehyde along with an interval of 2 hours. The peak value occurs after 6 hours, which means  the detecting results can be seen with naked-eyes after only 6 hours. As is shown in figure 4, compared to the blank control, experimental group with formaldehyde induction turns to pink apparently, meaning the designed reporter pathway has worked.

It is worth to be mentioned that the team OUC help us validate the result.
 
Moreover, in order to set up the corresponding relationship between the quantity of formaldehyde and the fluorescence value, we prepared a series of concentrations of formaldehyde(figure5a.). We found out that from the concentration of 300 micromole to 600 micromole, a preferable equation of linear regression could be obtained(figure5b.), which laid the cornerstone for creating precise and sensitive detecting devices.

Then we incubated our recombinant E. coli for more than 10 hours to test their reponse growth rates(figure 6a) and tolerance(figure 6b) to different concentrations of formaldehyde.

Finally, we tested the selectivity of our formaldehyde pathway by inducing the recombinant E. coli with acetaldehyde, DMSO and 6 other aldehydes. The results(figure 7) demonstrated good selsctivity of our recombinant plasmids.

We first analyzed the product by dual-enzyme digestion and electrophoresis(figure8). As can be seen, our hydrogen sulfide sensing sequence is over 3,000 base pairs.

Next, we conducted a plate sensitive assay to measure the S2– tolerance of E. coli cells with constructed probe pathway. All plates were incubated at 37℃ for 18 h before reading. No significant influence appeared to the growth of E. coli at a concentration lower than 10mmol/L.

Cells were then grown to midlog phase under aerobic conditions and 0 ~ 250 μM Na2S. Cells were harvest after 17h and assayed for fluorescence intensity. Error bars indicate SD of the mean.

Finally, we examined the plasmid's selectivity against SO42-, SO32- and 4 other chemical reagents(figure 11).

First  we succefully detected the  protein expression by SDS-Page(figure 12a) analysis and Western blot(figure 12b) analysis.

Fluorescence  intensity remains stationary when IPTG is added.               Whereas,  it increases in a low hydrogen atmosphere.              When  the amount of hydrogen goes to an even higher level, fluorescence intensity increases  apparently, meaning the designed report pathway  works as expected(figure 13).
