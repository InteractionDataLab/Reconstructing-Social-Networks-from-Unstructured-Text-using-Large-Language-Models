Model
We designed a questionnaire of the public opinions  about the interior decoration air pollution caused by formaldehyde, which  inspires us searching a better solution to it and making further progress.
1.Respondents
In  order to get a comprehensive knowledge of people's understanding about our  project, we collected a variety of respondents of different ages in different  education levels. Major respondents are students in universities, over 60%, and  undergraduates take up over 20% .
2.Occupation of respondents
Some  respondents majors in the life sciences both in application and theory taking  up 32%, and some respondents majors in the environmental sciences taking up  nearly 10% and the rest of them are from different fields.
3.Public cognition of formaldehyde harmness
Since formaldehyde has been the common  detrimental gas released form decorating materials and furniture, most people  are well aware of the harm of it and over 29% of respondents knows it in  explicit details.
4.Sources of formaldehyde
As for the producing source of the  formaldehyde, people hold very diverse views of it. 93% people think that it is  released from household products, such as glue, polishing agent and oil paint. Most  of people knows that building materials, synthetic wood products and some  medicine also produce formaldehyde. Least percentage of people knows that cigarette  smoke serves as an important pollution source as well.   
5.Formaldehyde detection
Although almost all respondents consider it  is necessary to detect formaldehyde in interior environment, they seldom detect  it by themselves because of lacking of professional device and methods.
6.Public cognition of the whole-cell system
As is shown to all, the whole-cell  detecting system seems to be a rather advanced and new way for the public, related  information is insufficient which shows our system presents a potential future  in China. People mostly concerns about the portability and safety of the  whole-cell system and they expect the system can perform not only specific to  the formaldehyde but also sensitive to a micro-scale amount. It would be more  satisfying if the system is easy to operate and cost a little. 84% people agree  that the whole-cell detecting system will be applied in the future and play a  more and more vital role in environmental protection.
