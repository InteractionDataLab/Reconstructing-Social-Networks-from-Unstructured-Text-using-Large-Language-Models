Due to their invisibility and perniciousness, detecting them  as specific and sensitive as possible is a must. However, traditional methods  have sort of drawbacks such as poor stability, susceptible to interference,  complicated to operate, expensive and so on. To solve the problems, we come up  with an idea about biosensor. By using biological components such as enzymes,  antibodies, sub-cellular components and microorganisms to obtain information,  we then build up a whole-cell system with these biosensors to detect out target  gases, which is exactly whole-cell sensor.
The detecting experiences a  series of links. First, the receptor of the cell receives certain extracellular  signals. Then through the signal transduction pathways, response element is  activated and induce the transcription of the reporter gene. At last, the  reporting protein is expressed and reflect the detecting outcome. The  whole-cell sensing systems have enormous potential and advantages in  application. Taking microorganism as biosensors’ carrier allows a rapid  proliferation which accommodates to the large-scale application. And their  portability permits the on-site monitoring. Concerning about the cost, they are  not only inexpensive but also easy to restore. Most importantly, thanks to the  Intracellular cascade reactions to magnify signals, the whole-cell sensing  systems demonstrate excellent specificity, sensitivity and stability, which are  the ultimate aims for detecting detrimental gases. So we can take advantage of  it to detect the three dangerous gases.
The three kind of dangerous  gas that we chose are hydrogen, formaldehyde and hydrogen formaldehyde.
Hydrogen, is not common in  our daily life. But it is likely to be leaked from chemical factory. Any spark  can induce terrifying explosion, which can expose great danger to the safety of  industry production.
Formaldehyde hides in every corner of our houses and has  pungent odor. It can usually discovered in decoration materials as well as  furniture, Besides, Illegal businessmen uses formaldehyde to improve the color  and taste of food. Formaldehyde is directly related to our health.
Hydrogen sulfide can also escape from the chemical factories like  hydrogen. But it is lethally toxic. In our daily life, It is often generated  from decayed food and is easily dissolved in water, which makes its pollution  area considerably large.
All of hydrogen,  formaldehyde and hydrogen formaldehyde are closely related to the industry and  our daily life. The use of sensor can help to issue an early warning once  there’s any leakage, thus preventing a large-scale leakage. Compared to the  traditional methods, whole-cell sensor has quite many advantages. It can be  portable, and easy to operate. It has the character of high stability and is unsusceptible  to interference. Besides, with the large supply and proliferation of the  bacteria, the whole-cell sensor can’t be too expensive, making it accessible to  ordinary people. With all the advantages, we believe our sensors make sense and  have a broad market prospect.
