Model
Our cell model examines the characteristics  of the FrmR and promotor PfrmAB regulatory pathways. By this  model, we predicted the behaviour of our biosensor under it’s designed  conditions. If this is consistent with the experimental observations, we can  confirm that the FrmR and promotor PfrmAB tuning networks  operate in the same way as originally assumed.[1]
The main modeling environment used in the project is  the MATLAB SimBiology toolkit, a plug-in designed for biology of computational  systems.The toolbox transforms the basic mathematics of system biology into a  graphical interface, making it an ideal choice for gene conditioning network  modeling. SimBiology will be used with deterministic differential equation  solver methods. In other words, each time the simulation is run, the  calculations are the same and give the same solution. This means that there is  no randomized result. In real life, the number has a certain degree of random  variation, which means a random model is useful. However, on the cell  population, these random variants yielded definitive results on average.

Our cellular model develops on the  characterization of the hoxBC-hoxJ and hoxA regulation pathway as well as predicting  the behavior of our Hydrogen biosensor under its designed conditions, through  which we can learn more details about the procession of hoxBC-hoxJ and hoxA regulation  pathway[1].
The main modelling environment utilized in  this project is the MATLAB SimBiology toolbox, a plugin designed specifically  for computational systems biology. SimBiology will be utilized with a  deterministic differential equation solver method. However in real life, there  is some degree of random variation in the quantities - this is where a  stochastic model would be useful. However, over a cell population these random  variations average out to give deterministic results.

The cellular model develops on the  characterization of the sqr and sqrR regulation pathway, aiming at  exploring the property of the designed H2S  detector system.
The main modeling environment utilized  in this project is the MATLAB SimBiology toolbox, a plugin designed  specifically for computational systems biology. SimBiology will be utilized  with a deterministic differential equation solver method. In real life, there  is random variation in quantities to some degree - this is where a stochastic model  would be useful. But these random variations can average out over a cell  population to give deterministic results.
