♠ We established Nanjing-China  2017 in March this year. Both the team leader and all team members are new  iGEMers, in which case great challenges were ahead of us. We determined that we  work on gas sensors and then read a lot of papers and conceived the outline of  our project.
♥ In April, we started synthesizing primers and genes with the help  of Sangon BiotechÒ and GenscriptÒ. We also made a proposal  within School of Life Science to secure funding and support.
♣ From May to  August, we were busy with lab work and optimizing experiments. At the end of  August, we sent 3 students to attend CCIC in Fuzhou, Fujian and asked iGEMers  from all over China to fill in our questionnaires so that we got to know what  they thought about our project.
♦ In September and October, we visited AddiseoÒ in Nanjing to learn  about biosafety issues, did all the other human practices and formed collaboration with team OUC-China. We also spread no effort in building wiki and modeling before November. We had been making beautiful  original design throughout the whole time. We were so lucky to have talented  and hard-working students to get everything neatly done before the Giant  Jamboree.
DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
1. Excise  the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean,  sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
2. Absorb  the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel  slice (tare with empty tube).
3. Add 3  volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
4.  Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating for 6-8 minutes). If  low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40℃. Intermittently vortexing every 2-3 minutes will do a lot of help to  accelerate the solubilization.
Note:  Buffer DE-A is red liquid, so you can observe the color to make sure the gel is  fully dissolved.
5. Add  0.5× Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B and mix. If the DNA fragment is less  than 400bp, supplement further with a 1×sample volume of isopropanol.
Note:  After the addition of DE-B, the solution should be in the uniform color of  yellow.
6. Place a  Miniprep column into a 2ml microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized  agarose from the step above into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1  minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
7. Return  the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 500ul of Buffer W1.  Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml  microfuge tube.
8. Return  the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2.  Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml  microfuge tube.
9．Place the Miniprep column back into the 2ml  microfuge tube. Add a second 700ul of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000×g for  1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
10. Place  the Miniprep column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000×g  for 1 minute.
 11. Transfer the Miniprep column into a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube  (provided). Add 50ul of ddH2O to the center of the membrane to elute the DNA.  Let it stand for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1  minute.
 Note: Pre-warm the ddH2O at 65℃ will generally improve  elution efficiency.
