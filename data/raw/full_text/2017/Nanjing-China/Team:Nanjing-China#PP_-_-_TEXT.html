In order to further extend the range and  improve the sensitivity of detection, we expect to enhance the expression of  SQR by substituting psqrR with pcons, the most  efficient promotor among the igem parts. By doing so, we ensure that there  is enough SQR in the system to oxidize even a small amount of S2- in  time.
We have replaced psqrR with BBa_J23100(pcons). Part BBa_J23100 can successfully start the expression of sqr. After the replacement, we have observed RFP response upon  inducing the new pathway with 100 μmol/L Na2S, which proves that the new pathway works.We are still measuring the strength of pcons against psqrR in the function Part BBa_K2257006 .
