Collaboration
We have formed online collaboration with NEFU since September. We informed each other about our progress and helped each other with experimental puzzles. Some of the problems we tackled together are listed as follows.
♝:We plasmid vector can't be cut.
♗:It may be because of the enzyme had losed potency :
Plasmid was contaminated with protein
The plasmid may be dissolved in a solution that inhibited the activity of the enzyme
♝:What should we do to link three parts efficiently?
♗:Use isocaudamer.
♝: What should we do when we we want to dye the sample by Comassie blue staining and WB.
♗:When you add the samlpe, you should pay attention to the amount of it. Measure the value of OD to get the concentration of the sample you need and then add the sample. When making up polyacrylamide agarose gel, wash and dry the holder. In that way, you can get the gel free of bubble.
