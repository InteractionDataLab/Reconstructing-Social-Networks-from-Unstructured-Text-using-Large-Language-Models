It relies on transcriptional repressor.

Protein FrmR acts as a regulator, it can form DNA-protein  cross-links with a special promotor PfrmAB to prevent activating downstream  gene transcription 
Formaldehyde is able to covalently modify protein FrmR,  inhibiting its function, so when formaldehyde exists, promotor PfrmAB is  capable of activating downstream gene transcription by the destruction of the  promoter PfrmAB- the protein FrmRcross-link.
Similar to the hydrogen sensor, we change the downstream gene  to RFP. Next, we ligated these elements successfully and finished the  constructor with the correct sequencing data.
As to the hydrogen sulfide sensor, we also designed a whole-cell biocatalytic system, displaying the concentration of hydrogen sulfide by the compound’s influence on specific genes’ expression in modified E.coli. Our idea is inspired from a type of bacterium that can live on sulfide.

The leading role in the system is a repressor protein called  sqrR. Itinhibits the expression of Sqr via its binding to the promoter region  of sqr. Sqr is a protein that  oxidizes minus-two-valent S to zero-valent S.With the presence of hydrogen  sulfide, the oxidized S can interact with the sqrR that is binding to the Psqr,  forming a tetrasulfide bond and terminating the inhibition.
In  our design, we use red fluorescent protein as the indicator.When hydrogen  sulfide exits, the gene transcription is activated, and the bacteria turns red.
This design is Inspired from Cupriavidusnecator H16.

Protein hoxB and hoxC   form a Heterodimeric core they acts as an hydrogen sensor in concert  with the histidine protein kinase HoxJ . This RH-HoxJ complex detects the  presence of hydrogen in the environment and transmits the signal to a response  regulator HoxA. The response regulator, HoxA, is active in its  non-phosphorylated form and inactivated by HoxJ-mediated phosphorylation. In  the hydrogen atmosphere, HoxA is unphosphorylated and interacts with a promotor  Phox, and it is capable of activating downstream gene transcription.
