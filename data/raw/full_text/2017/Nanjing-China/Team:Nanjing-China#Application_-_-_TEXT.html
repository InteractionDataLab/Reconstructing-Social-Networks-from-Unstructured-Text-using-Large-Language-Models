Application
In order to promote the application of the achievements, we have designed a portable device.After the dehydration and refrigeration, the bacteria can be stored and transferred easily so that the portable device is easy to use in our daily life. When needed, the bacteria can be recovered after the humidification and heating. Therefore, the whole system can work to detect the target gas. We have referred from the design in a paper, from which we have developed our own idea.
However, the components of the air are capricious and complex  so that a bio-chip which permits the use of numerous strains in one smaller  unit has surly promising prospect. With one single test, different bio-sensors  are activated specifically to show a greater amount of detecting information.  In that case, the bio-chip will accommodate to diverse environments by  high-throughput analysis.
F1. The device of whole-cell  gas sensors:
This device is  composed of two parts. One is the container, the other is the replaceable inner  core with recombinant Escherichia Coil inside. And the device’s side is  transparent, easy for user to observe the color change of bacteria liquid. Through  the air inlet pipe, we can pump the air into the cores using needle cylinder or  pump. We designed four separate parts with independent air inlet pipes and  stopcocks which make the parallel tests and negative control experiment  possible.
 
F2. The close-up  view of inner core, liquid inlet and microporous filter:
At the bottom of  inner core, there is a small hole connecting to the pipe which allows air to go  in. Besides, the hole is sealed by filter, and this can prevent the bacteria  from spreading. Similarly, the filter on the top of inner core allows us to  inject liquid such as alcohol which can kill the bacteria and be easily  accessed, as well as keep bacteria inside. In a word, this inner core is  completely sealed for bacteria and environment-friendly.
 
F3. The housing of  whole-cell gas sensors:
After using any of  the four inner cores, users can replace them with the new one. And the housing,  including pipe and pedestal, is reusable.
