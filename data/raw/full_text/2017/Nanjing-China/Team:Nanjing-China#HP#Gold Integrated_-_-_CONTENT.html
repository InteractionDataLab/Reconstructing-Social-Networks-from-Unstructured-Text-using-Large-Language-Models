We went there  with the purpose of carrying out on-site research on harmful gas safety. Three workers  of the company's security department were quite hospitable during the whole  reception. As we could see, the company's security measures were very strict, visitors  were required to register, change into the  labor security clothing  before visiting the plant, wear helmets and goggles and turn off the phone and all other electronic equipment.</P><P align="left">
        Firstly, we went to the  office area for interview. The main business of Blue Star ADISSEO covers the  development and production of methionine. The process involves a large quantity  of hydrogen sulfide so gas leakage detection is of great  importance. The whole plant has a total of more than 100 fixed hydrogen sulfide detectors, each of which can detect a radius of 5 meters. The maximum  allowable concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the air is 10 mg / m3. When  the concentration reaches 3 ppm (about 4.56 mg / m3), the fixed instrument will  issue an alarm while it will issue a high alarm with the concentration of 6  ppm.</P><P align="left">The company's security  department conducts an overall inspection of the 300 gas detectors, which  usually takes about two weeks. Every year, the company has to accept the  national compulsory security checks. Once the company meets the qualifications,  it will obtain the relevant certificates.</P><P align="left">
          The detector is made up of two parts, the  main body with a display panel and the sensor probe. The former one is of 6-7  thousand Yuan while the latter is of 3-4 thousand Yuan. As the hydrogen  sulfide and the electrolyte inside the sensor has an irreversible chemical  reaction, it needs a regular replacement. Its life can reach up to 3 years if no special circumstances occur. But the frequency of replacement might  be high where the leakage of hydrogen sulfide happens more easily. In addition,  the intelligent property of the instrument ensures that it will automatically  issue an alarm to remind the staff of replacing the probe when the sensor’s  life is less than 10%.</P><P>In addition to the hydrogen  sulfide detector around the device, whenever a leak or a suspected leakage  occurs, the relevant technical staff need to wear a respirator breathing mask and hold  a  portable detector into the field to find the leak point. At the  moment of interview, there were several portable detectors charigng in the office.  One of the workers volunteered to demonstrate the operation for us. (See video)</P><P align="left">Because the sensor is  affected by temperature, air pressure, gas flow rate and other factors,   sudden change of the weather (such as summer thunderstorms) may cause zero  drift resulting in false positives. At that point, the staff will decide  whether to evacuate based on the scene. If the alarm is true, workers will  quickly evacuate all the people to the upper area and then involve the  security sector personnel in. If the leakage is serious, the device will  automatically cut off all the reactions so that the root source of the  generation of hydrogen sulfide is cut off. If the device is due to the aging of  the tiny holes, the company will immediately invite the department of  maintenance to conduct the  emergency  plugging. And they will replace the whole pipe during the shutdown inpection  period annually.</P><P align="left">
          Under the guidance of the workers,  we participated a simple safety training. We put on a full set of labor security  clothing, wore reflective vests, helmets and goggles and visited the control  room and the device around the fixed sensor. It was really hot under the sun,  we were all sweaty wearing the clothes. Once thinking about the factory workers  who wear the clothes every day, we were really touched by their dedication to  their job.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="interview"><DIV class="word" align="left"><P>On September 27, three members of team Nanjing-China went to  interview professor Zhang yan in School of chemistry and chemical engineering  in Nanjing University , who focus on the design and construction of molecular  probes for molecular imaging.</P><P> </P><P>The students who were responsible for the formaldehyde probe  experiment first expressed the confusion about the linear relationship between  the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of formaldehyde aqueous  solution. Prof Zhang mentioned the measurement of  target protein and formaldehyde molecules  binding constants, and reminded us to make it clear the relationship between extracellular  formaldehyde concentration and intercellular formaldehyde concentration , so as  to know how much the effective combination of quantitative detection of  formaldehyde molecule and protein.</P><P> </P><P>Prof Zhang noted that the experimental environment was our solution,  but our goal was to detect gas content in the air, so she reminded us thinking how  to achieve gas enrichment to the solution. She said that chemical reactions were  often used to convert the detected substance into another one, but it was not  possible for us to specifically target formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, and  hydrogen. She then talked about another chemical method using a model substrate  so that in the bacterial culture environment with formaldehyde, we could  achieve high concentration of formaldehyde in the cell microenvironment. </P><P>Prof Zhang encouraged us not to focus too much on the whole cell  probe, but to think the concept of smart cell. She believed that even at this  stage of the physical and chemical probe occupying a strong market, we could  still prove that the whole cell sensing system was extremely advantageous.</P><P> </P><P>Next, we consulted Prof Zhang for the safety of experimental  operations. She reminded us that the operation must be completed in the  volatile solution in the fume hood; for the organic solution of different  concentration, we had to concern about cell tolerance and find the maximum  operating concentration from database to protect the safety of personnel.</P><P> </P><P>Prof Zhang said we had to know if the target gas metabolism pathway  of the cell itself interferes with our experiments. She agreed that hydrogen  sulfide and formaldehyde were  important  signaling molecules in organisms. If the target gas in cells is of a high  affinity, it is bound to have a certain impact on the results of our  experiment.</P><P> </P><P>Finally, we compared the similarities and differences of small chemical  molecules in traditional probe and Prof Zhang recognized the innovations and  challenges of our project and wished the experiments to achieve good results.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="video"><DIV align="center"><DIV class="word"><DIV align="left"><P align="left">Greatly inspired  from our trip to AddiseO and our interview with professor Yan Zhang, we have  designed and made a little film about the bio-safety measures in our lab. 
            Besides bacteria,  fluorescent dyes and UV light, we deal with formaldehyde and hydrogen every day,  which poses great threat to our safety. Therefore, it is of great importance to  conduct all the experiments under certain bio-safety norms which cater our  specific needs. 
            There are  altogether four parts in our film, including explanations of operations in the  super clean bench, in the fume chamber (formaldehyde-related), in the gas  chamber(hydrogen-related) as well as under the UV light.
            In this film, we  try to not only promote the bio-safety measures in our lab but also encourage  more teams to engage in this huge cause and find better solutions.</P><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV align="center"><DIV class="f"><DIV class="f-word"><P><STRONG><U>Address</U></STRONG></P><P>Life Science Department
