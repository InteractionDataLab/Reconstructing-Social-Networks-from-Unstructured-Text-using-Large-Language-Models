We are a group of Chinese students with  dreams and aims from Nanjing University. In 2017 we started our iGEM tour as  sophomores and seniors. Although at the beginning most of us were unfamiliar  with synthetic biology and related experimental skills in molecular biology, we  then made the decision to embrace this challenging but rewarding competition.
Our team is composed of students from Life  Science Department. Everyone have tried to make the most of talents in  ourselves to achieve innovations and render enhancements. Learning and  creativity are the best friends standing by us along this journey.
The iGEM competition is truly an  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get fully involved in scientific  research, from thinking a new idea, operating experiments, carrying out human  practices, designing wiki and posters and presenting our work completely at  last. There was a time we could still well remember when it became our daily  routine to meet with each other, brainstorming to polish our project. We have  harvest not only the satisfying outcome but also friendship and scientific  enthusiasm.
Other than every incredible team member,  we have also received amazing support from our advisors, instructors and  sponsors.
