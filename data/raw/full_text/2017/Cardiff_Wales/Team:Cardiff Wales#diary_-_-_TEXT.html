Review to do lists
Safety = Helen
Sequencing = Niall
Plants = Jade and Sarah
Stockroom = Emily, Ryan, and Thomas
Arranged lab and workspaces
Sorted pipette tips into boxes and autoclaved.
Made medium using 25 g/l LB broth. Made medium using 10g/L agar granulated (made up to 400ml water). Then autoclaved. Pyrex class will not smash, cools down quickly/till hand-hot.
Chloramphenicol + kanamycin resistance antibiotics: One medium had 100mg/ml kanamycin added (400microlitres to 400ml), the other had 34mg/ml chloramphenicol added (400microlitres to 400ml). Plated 19 plates of each.
Transferred tobacco plants (grown on 19/6) into new pots to prevent overcrowding.
Organised ourselves into 3 'teams':

Redid failed PCR from yesterday and ran on a gel - slightly more success (Primer dimers (probably) in 2 lanes).
Niall carried out the first part of 2 SOE-PCRs to convert target nucleotides for BsmBI digestion into non-target nucleotides through site directed mutagenesis. SOE-PCRs used to modify the P19 gene and LUCx5 gene.
Ran on gel - gDNA was poor so no bands.
Ryan: Performed plasmid minipreps according to QIAprep® Spin Miniprep Kit. Measured the concentrations of each of the DNA samples.
Digest and ligation using the P5B1C3g plasmid for golden gate cloning, using both TSHantag and TSHantag-his.

Ran gels with PDF1p, PR2p, GST6p, and WRKY30p, with gDNAs 2 and 3 (highest DNA concentration samples). All lanes were successful with no contamination, except WRKY which had no result except primer dimers.
Cut and digested the gels and purified DNAs - 3 test tubes each with either PDF, PR or GST promoter regions.
Measured concentrations of the promoter DNA.
Set up PCR of WRKY30p at different temperatures (gradient in the PCR machine). Temperatures 50, 53, 57, and 60 degrees.
Ran gels with 8 lanes (4 negative controls, and 4 with one of each of the WRKY temperatures)
All 4 samples had primer dimers but no amplified gDNA - conclusion = most likely primers are not specific enough to amplify gDNA

Redo TSH/H 3:1, TSH/H 5g, TSH 5:1 and biobrick controls for transformations.
Incubation over night
Made up agar plates inoculated with either chloramphenicol or chloramphenicol, X-gal and IPTG. Reducing the concentration of chloramphenicol from 34 to 17, and doubling the concentration of X-gal.

Team_Luc
Ran PCRs with WRKY at 52 and 56 degrees for primer annealing. With half and double primer concentration in each, to see if either would prevent primer dimers and allow annealing to DNA.
Ran gel and found only primer dimers in every sample. gDNA is fine because the positive control had its band.
WRKY primer is ineffective, so we must design another.
Plates again did not work. Put them in the incubator at 37 degrees.
Possible problems with chloramphenicol
Running PCR of TSH 5G and TSH10G colonies.

Human outreach aspects: producing a survey investigating people’s perspectives on producing a protein using tobacco plants to treat Grave’s Disease. Dewi put on twitter!! Also Skype call with Washington team to discuss collaborations.
Checked the plates grown overnight - B1 and B2 grew very well however the plates from the iGEM registry grew more slowly.
Cultures from the B1 and B2 plates were inoculated with kanamycin and left to grow over the weekend in a shaking incubator at 22 degrees.
The plants that were infiltrated on 12/07/2017 were prepared by grinding them in a pestle and mortar on ice with EZ extraction buffer, before centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 5 minutes. 1/10 the volume of buffer Z was then added to the supernatant liquid in a fume hood before placing them in the freezer.

Inspected colonies - all white with contamination, including the negative control - suspect the plates did not have Chloramphenicol or X-Gal.
Re-ran PCR of level 1 plasmid - no bands so must redo transformation.
Transformed more competent cells with the level 1 35S-XVE-NosT plasmid, as these had not grown at all. Incubate at 37 degrees overnight.
Recombine pGEM-EASY plasmid with PDF, PR, and GST. Geraint will try and transform some cells to see if these work, otherwise they will be transformed in the morning after 22 degree overnight incubation.

Addition of adenine to the g blocks by treating with taq. Must add taq to the Gblock before the normal reaction.
Ligation reaction to get the g blocks into the pGEM plasmid.
Transformations and the cells were left to grow overnight.
Biobrick Plates left to grow over the weekend at room temperature showed 1 white colonies on TSH 5:1.
Golden gate plates showed more success, with white colonies on TSH2, TSHH2.
The unsuccessful biobrick plates were incubated at 37 degrees to encourage growth.
Golden gate plates placed in fridge after incubation to help decipher the colouring of the colonies.
Possible reasons why: X-gal problems? No Chloramphenicol. Did it degrade? Negative control was white! Not good!
Still grew the plates in L
Human outreach: emailed ITV and BBC wales regarding project. Also contacted Wales Online. Contacted british association of endocrine and thyroid surgeons about helping us with clinical outreach. Also contacted British Thyroid Association about our project.

Level 0: All P19, LUCx5, PDF1, PR2, GST6 colonies taken from white colonies from previous day turned out to be blue on new plates.
Carried out another transformation using PDF, PR, GST, P19 and LUCx5 digests. After transformation, plated cells on old agar plates with IPTG, x-gal and Chl to grow over the weekend.
Level 1: Performed another level 1 digest with 35S, XVE and NOSt, transformed cells and grew over the weekend
WRKY: New primers proved successful - ran PCR products on gel and carried out DNA extraction from gel. Have now isolated WRKY promoter sequence.
Transformations using pGEM (TSH/TSHH) and gblock (TSH/TSHH), grew up the colonies over the weekend
More editing of survey - remove the section on Graves' disease
Valencia skype call for collaborations (look at last years valencia Wiki).
Get ready for talk on monday at 2 pm (what have we done so far).
Transformed competent cells in batch #2 and #3 with GFP (and without as a negative control) to test whether the new batch were more effective. These were left to grow on the bench over the weekend.
Spread colonies from the B2-1 plate onto two new plates (kan + rif) in order to grow over the weekend. B1-1 was not used as the colonies grew poorly over the two day period.

Level 0: Every colony white AGAIN - old plates may have had poor X-gal. Re-plating the transformed cells from 28/07/17 on fresh plates with functional x-gal to grow overnight.
Also re-plating 20 white colonies from P19, LUCx5, PDF, PR, GST on fresh plates to check for successfully transformed cells on plates from 28/07/17.
Level 1: No colony growth on plates from 28/07/17… Not sure why, could be that there isn’t enough pGB-a2 plasmid DNA (Ryan vortexed during the mini-prep protocol where he shouldn’t have), maybe kanamycin is killing all the cells?  - going to ask Geraint and then potentially do another digest.
WRKY: Set up a lvl 0 restriction digest, then transformed cells with product and grew overnight.
Prepping for 2pm talk (what is the project? What have we experienced in the practical work? Human outreach aspects?) Colonies grown over weekend from 28/0717
Successful transformants showing white colonies from TSHH pGEM, TSHH gblock and TSH gblock. No colonies were visible from TSH pGEM (plates: chl, x-gal, IPTG).
Grown on chl 300 ul LB broth and colonies.
Colony PCR of TSHH gblock (X), TSHH pGEM (Y), TSH gblock (Z).
Ran a gel using the PCR products.
Made more chloramphenicol 34 µg/ml plates.
Re-transformed the competent cells as was done on 28/7/17 as the negative plates had a lot of colonies on them. This could have been due to the plates used being fairly old. These new transformations were left to grow overnight at 37 degrees celsius.
Inoculated B2-1 with kanamycin and rif to grow overnight at 28 degrees celsius. In order to infiltrate tomorrow.

Inserted WRKY into pGEM plasmid. Transformed and grew cells - none grew.
Set up ligation of pGEM GST, PR, PDF plasmids into level 1 18J plasmid. Transformed cells and Grew cells on plates - some blue colonies, most plates with no growth.
Set up sequencing tubes of pGEM versions of PDF, PR, and GST - 50ng/ul in 15ul.
PCR:
Gel using PCR products from 31/07/17 inconclusive. No negative control used so bands could not be analysed.
Therefore, grew colonies from PCR products from 31/07. Only 2 white colonies (2 TSHH gblocks (9 + 10) transformed. 14 of the other colonies failed to transform, remaining blue in colour.
Following the transformations, a colony PCR was carried out (2 TSHH gblocks, one blue TSH pGEM, one negative (no DNA), positive control (plasmid)).
Ran a gel using the PCR products. No bands were present in the lanes representing the colonies.
Level 0 plasmid:
Using the level 0 plasmid completed a digest and ligation.
Increased BsmB1 volume from 0.5 ul to 1ul. Also increased T4 ligase from 0.5 ul to 1 ul.
Plates:
Made 16 Chl + x-gal + IPTG and 8 AMP + x-gal + IPTG plates 2 chl + x-gal + IPTG plates used to plate cells from the transformations using the digestion/ligation products from earlier in the day. The plates were grown overnight.
pGEM plates:
Original TSH pGEM and TSHH pGEM colonies grown, grown further on fresh AMP + x-gal + IPTG plates. 20 colonies from each plate grown on the 2 new plates.
Checked the transformations that were redone - they were successful with the negative control plates showing no colonies. #2 and #3 are approximately the same level of competency
The agrobacteria containing B2 were infiltrated into the tobacco leaves.

Performed BsMB1 digest at 55 degrees on all parts PDF, PR, GST, P19 and Luc. Left for two hours with mixture at 55 degrees.
Performed ligation separately at 16 degrees for 1 hour 45mins. Negative control had the ligase buffer but no insert.
Plated these plates on level 0 Chl plates and grew overnight. -ve control shared between no insert and no ligase.
Plates from transformation
Plates from 01/08/17 failed to transform. Current thought is that 55 degrees is too hot for the ligation to occur.
Therefore, digest and ligation carried out separately when investigating TSH and TSHH gblocks. Digest took place at 55 degrees for 2 hours using buffer 3.1 (10x) BSA, insert (TSH/TSHH gblock), BSMBI, water and P6-18J plasmid. A negative control was also included.
Ligation at 16 degrees for 2 hours using T4 ligase buffer, cut vector and insert TSH from original digest and T4 ligase enzyme. T4 ligase enzyme was not incorporated into the negative control.
Products of the digest and ligation then transformed and left to incubate overnight.
pGEM plates:
Colonies grown from original TSH/TSHH pGEM plates grown in broth and left overnight.
Designed the luciferin experiment for tomorrow.
Calculated the relevant concentration of buffer required for tomorrow.

Analysed plates: colonies on every plate including both sides of the negative control. Much more on TSH plates than promoter plates - I did not resuspend the cells efficiently?
Picked 5 colonies from each plate for colony PCRs. Grown in LChl for 3 hours.
Made another IPTG stock.
Digested WRKY at 55 degrees, then ligated at 16 degrees.
Created LChl plates with IPTG, and 2x X-Gal.
Transformed cells with WRKY digest/ligation product and plated on LChl, IPTG, 2x X-Gal plates.
Ran Gel with PCR product from promoter colonies.
TSH/H gblock transformations from 02/08 displayed both white and blue colonies after being left in fridge to develop colour. 2 negative controls (1 no ligase/1 no insert), both showed white and blue colonies. White transformants especially apparent on TSH no ligase control. The no insert control showed fewer colonies probably due to inadequate re-suspension.
Colonies grown underwent colony PCR in order to extract possible insert DNA.
pGEM minipreps:
Minipreps of TSH/H pGEM grown overnight.
1st minipreps were at 14 ug/nl and 13 ug/nl.
2nd miniprep concentrations were 27.55 TSH and 62.650 TSHH
Sent TSH/H pGEM vectors off for sequencing.
Made the buffer for the luciferin experiment - mes 50mM, EDTA 1mM, glucose 0.5%, DMSO 0.5%
Pipetted the buffer into the relevant wells then added the leaf disc cuttings. Luciferin was then added at either 1 or 0.5 mM to the relevant wells. The plate was left in the dark for 2 hours before testing on the imager.
1mM luciferin in sodium citrate solution was infiltrated into a whole leaf (control, concentration A or concentration B) in order to image whole leaf samples.

WRKY plates have colonies on them. Unclear whether they are blue or white so left over the weekend in the fridge to develop - will perform colony PCRs on monday.
Re-performed digest and ligation of PDF, PR, GST, P19, Luc. Digest at 55 degrees, then denatured at 80 degrees, then ligated at 16 degrees. Transformed cells but did not have time to incubate and plate cells, so left them at room temperature to incubate over the weekend. Plating first thing on monday.
3 white colonies on TSHH gblock plate and 1 on TSH gblocks. Colony PCR on these successful white colonies. Put fridge over the weekend.
Need to run a gel on monday and miniprep those that have the insert DNA
Also grew more colonies from original TSH/H gblock plates. Ready for miniprep on monday.
Digestion and ligation reactions using the biobrick plasmid and the TSH and TSHH gblocks.
Then transformations using the ligation reaction from earlier and plated out onto chloramphenicol plates.
Gel ran using the cut and uncut biobrick plasmid, there were no bands present.
Planned a repeat luciferin experiment for monday.
Performed a ligation digest of level 0 parts into a level 1 plasmid, which was left in the fridge over the weekend to transform on monday morning.

Streaked the transformed cells from separate digest and ligation of PDF, PR, GST, P19 and Luc. Growing overnight at 37 degrees.
Picked 12 colonies from WRKY plate (possible whites) and grew in 1ml LB with 1ul Chl (wrong measurement - got confused with transformations!) - growing for 20hours to make up for the additional volume.
Spoke with Jamie: is it worth forgetting the colony PCRs and doing diagnostic digests instead? Also isolate just the uncut plasmid and use that for transformations by digesting and extracting the now linear plasmid?
None of the biobrick colonies from Friday grew.
Additional colonies grown from original TSH gblock plates miniprepped before PCR.
Previous colony PCR’s unsuccessful due to base insertions. . Alternative strategy to miniprep before PCR procedures no working so hoping minipreps will help the PCR.
Carried out the luciferin experiment again and carried out the data analysis of it.
Transformed the level 1 ligation mix that was left over the weekend in the fridge. The bacteria were spread over 5 agar plates (kan,IPTG,X-gal) to give a better chance of growth. These plates were left overnight in the 37.

Screened for blue/white colonies on PDF, PR, GST, P19 and Luc plates. 9, 5, 1, 1 and 0 white colonies, respectively. Picked these cells and grown in 5ml of Chl broth instead of colony PCR due to the low results.
Performed colony PCRs of the 12 white WRKY colonies. Used the same colony twice with 58 and 59 primers and also with the WRKY-specific primers.
Transformed WRKY cells and grew on Chl, X-gal, IPTG plates.
Gel produced from miniprep PCR from 7/08 promising. Regrew remaining colonies overnight (7th/8th).
Mini-prepped these colonies for PCR.
PCR performed on the mini preps and then a gel was run using the PCR products.
White colonies were observed over the 5 level 1 plates that were left to grow overnight (approximately 30 individual white colonies).
Set up a colony PCR however the primers used were not correct. So 10 colonies were inoculated to grow overnight.

Presentation work
TSH6 and TSHH2:
Ran the gel from PCR reaction from 08/08. Both TSH6 and TSHH2 showed successful banding.
Set-up sequencing reactions for 10/08. Had to grow up more plasmid. These mini-prepped and sent off for sequencing tomorrow.
Digest:
Level one digest completed using BSA1, the digest included TSH/H, 35S or LexA and NosT. The digest was done at 37 degrees for 3 hours.
The enzymes were then heat inactivated at 80 degrees for 15 minutes.
T4 ligase was then added and the ligation reaction was done at 16 degrees overnight.
Mini-prepped 5 out of the 10 level 1 colonies grown overnight, resuspending them in 30 µl of Elution buffer.
These were then digested using BsmB1 before running them on a gel. This gel was very inconclusive, so this digest/gel will need to be redone.

Performed colony PCRs and analysed gels. Inconclusive results -  likely worked for P19 but not for GST -  hard to compare band sizes with LacZ as they are similar.
Sequenced PDF, PR, GST and P19 - GST ok, issues with the others.
Only those colonies miniprepped prior to PCR showed bands once the gel had been run.
Performed a digest on the biobrick containing the TSH to see if there were 2 bans on the gel, when we ran the gel there were no bands.
Level 1:
3LexA/4LexA/135S/35s plates showed both white and blue colonies. These growing in broth and Kan before PCR/miniprep procedures.
Performed colony PCR on white colonies, no bands.
Unable to do the procedures as the bacteria have not grown.
Inoculated broth with chl and IPTG to grow the level 0 NOS-T, 35s and Luc+ over the weekend at 22 degrees in the shaking incubator.

Transformation to compare #4 vs. #3 of competent cells. Left to grow overnight at 37 degrees.
Transformed 35S-OTMV from the iGEM registry (plate 6-14D) as there have been problems with the 35S that has been used. So this is to act as a backup if the level 1 reactions do not work. Left to grow overnight.
Re-ran the level 1 digest/gel as was done yesterday but we reduced the digest time to 17 minutes. The bands obtained looked more promising but there is still no correlation between all the different samples tested (there should be as they're all supposedly the same level 1 construct).
Inoculated tubes 1,2,3,5 of the old level 1 cultures again (35s,xve,nos-t) to mini prep tomorrow.

Level 1 cells had not grown enough so left again for another night.
Level0 p19 and LucX5 had white colonies, so they were picked and grown in broth overnight.
Checked plates from previous day: batch #4 of competent cells still grew on Cl plates, meaning they have developed Cl resistance (we’ve now thrown them away), and the 35S registry part plates failed to grow colonies
Re-did the level 1 reaction (cloning 35S, XVE and NosT into A1 plasmid): digested the plasmid, then added ligase - left at 16 degrees for 4 hours, then left at 4 degrees O/N
Started a culture of competent cells (from competent cell batch #3) to make competent cells up tomorrow

Looked at the plates from the previous day: the plates grown on Kanamycin had tiny colonies, so they were put back in the incubator, whilst the plates grown on Chloramphenicol had only 2 white colonies on WRKY/PDF and 1 white colony on PR/PDF - these white colonies were inoculated to grow O/N, and also picked into water to be used for colony PCR (primers 57 and 58). The rest of the level 0 plates (on Chloramphenicol) were put in the fridge in the hope that more white colonies might be seen.
Colony PCR: picked colonies into 20ul water, denatured at 95 degrees for 5 minutes, then took 2ul forward into a PCR reaction (94 degrees 20 seconds, 56 degrees 20 seconds, 72 degrees 2 minutes).

Picked level 1 colonies from GST, PR and PDF (supposed) level 1 plates, but the negative plate had some white colonies so the water we used was indeed contaminated. Picked and grew all white colonies to test them. If they are TSHH also then we will have to redo luc+ level 1s again!
Infiltrated the leaves with salicylic acid and/or ethanol at 5% each.
Emily set up PCR to isolate luc+ part with primers 22 and 23. This will isolate the luc+ from the spectinomycin plasmid to put into the pSB1C3g.
Ran Luc+ samples on gel and extracted the DNA.
Measured Luc+ DNA concentrations and set up digest for 30 minutes only due to time with 15minutes to denature. Ligated over the weekend (16 degrees for 4 hours and final hold 4 degrees).
Cut off infiltrated leaves and flash froze them. Stored at -80 degrees over the weekend.
Results of gel run on 31/08
64+65 = bands at 1800bp, however white colonies show bands at the same positions as the 35s TSH/TSHH minipreps. Also bands at 1000 bp
64+37 = bands visible even when 37 is specific to LexA promoter
44+65 = bands visible but same length as 64+65
Protocols write up
Transform 35S from the registry- grow it over the weekend.

A digest reaction was carried out using BsmbI, BSA, H20, level 0 pSBIC3, LUC+ NEB buffer 3.1. The digest reaction was left for 1.5 hours at 55 degrees. Following this, denaturation of the digest solution took place at 80 degrees for 15 min before inserting 2 ul T4 DNA ligase Buffer and 1 ul T4 DNA ligase for the ligation reaction to proceed at 16 degrees for 2 hours.

mini prepped PDF/PR/GST Luc+ lvl 1 colonies and PCR’d with forward primers for each promoter (45/47/49 respectively) and Luc+ reverse primer.
finished preparing leaf samples from yesterday.
grew up agro containing PDF:TSHH ready to infiltrate on thursday (hopefully JA will arrive).
Ran another PCR and gel with WRKY Luc+ samples and TSHH samples with primer 66 (WRKY forward) and primers 41 and 56 (Luc+ reverse and TSHH reverse, respectively). The previous one was not clear.
