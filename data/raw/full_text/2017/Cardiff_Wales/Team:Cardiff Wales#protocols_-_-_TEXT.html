Transformation of E. coli cells
To a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add 50 µl of competent cells to 10ul of DNA and leave on ice for 10 minutes. Heat shock at 42 °C for 1 min before putting the cells back on ice for 5 min. Following this, add 1 ml LB broth with no antibiotic before shaking in the incubator 1 hour at 37 °C. On a chloramphenicol, X-gal and IPTG plate, add 5-10 glass beads with 200 ul of cells and DNA from incubation. Shake the plates until the cells and DNA are equally distributed across the plate. Remove the beads and incubate the plate at 37°C overnight.
