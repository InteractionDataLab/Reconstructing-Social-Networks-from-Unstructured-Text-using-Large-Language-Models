Using Plant Synthetic Biology to generate therapeutics for treatment of thyroid disease.
The 2017 Cardiff-Wales project has dual aims.
Primarily we will develop tools for plant synthetic biology using the golden gate phytobricks standard. We will take previously characterized promotor elements that respond to a variety of environmental stimuli and move these into the phytobrick standard. These promotor elements will be used to generate TUs that drive reporter gene expression and will represent useful tools for future iGEM teams.
Secondly we will use these phytobricks to express the composite TSHantag protein, which is an antagonist for Graves Disease, caused by hyperthyroidism. The TSHantag has not previously been used as a therapeutic agent so we will use the tobacco gene expression system to produce high levels of the protein, which will then be tested in a human in vitro system by collaborators at the Cardiff University Medical School.
We have expertise using the tobacco expression system so will welcome collaborations with iGEM teams who wish to test the function of their proteins in plants!
This promises to be an exciting year of iGEM research!

Template documentation
Styling your wiki
You may style this page as you like or you can simply leave the style as it is. You can easily keep the styling and edit the content of these default wiki pages with your project information and completely fulfill the requirement to document your project.
While you may not win Best Wiki with this styling, your team is still eligible for all other awards. This default wiki meets the requirements, it improves navigability and ease of use for visitors, and you should not feel it is necessary to style beyond what has been provided.
Wiki template information
We have created these wiki template pages to help you get started and to help you think about how your team will be evaluated. You can find a list of all the pages tied to awards here at the Pages for awards link. You must edit these pages to be evaluated for medals and awards, but ultimately the design, layout, style and all other elements of your team wiki is up to you!
Editing your wiki
On this page you can document your project, introduce your team members, document your progress and share your iGEM experience with the rest of the world!

Tips
This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:
State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and how you plan to do this.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2017 calendar
Have lots of fun!

You can also view other team wikis for inspiration! Here are some examples:

Uploading pictures and files
You can upload your pictures and files to the iGEM 2017 server. Remember to keep all your pictures and files within your team's namespace or at least include your team's name in the file name.
When you upload, set the "Destination Filename" to
T--YourOfficialTeamName--NameOfFile.jpg. (If you don't do this, someone else might upload a different file with the same "Destination Filename", and your file would be erased!)
