Basic Parts used in our Project
Our team used several basic parts to create our gene constructs. Here is an overview  of all the individual parts that our team attempted to work with, each with a description of the part, its function, and what we did with them.
Unfortunately we did not add part information to our Judging Form , but our contributions are outlined below.

Summary
Length
BBa_K2404000
TSH
P10500
A gene that produces a protein which competitively inhibits TSH and auto-immune antibodies in Graves' disease. This variant does not have His-tags for purification
780bp
BBa_K2404001
TSHH
P10500
A gene that produces produces a protein which competitively inhibits TSH and auto-immune antibodies in Graves' disease. This variant does have His-tags for purification
832bp
BBa_K2404002
PDF1.2
P10500
An inducible promoter that responds to the presence of jasmonic acid in the cell
522bp
BBa_K2404003
PR2
P10500
An inducible promoter that responds to the presence of salicylic acid in the cell
519bp
BBa_K2404004
GST6
P10500
An inducible promoter that responds to the presence of salicylic acid in the cell
519bp
BBa_K2404005
WRKY30
P10500
An inducible promoter that responds to the presence of cellulose-derived oligomers
After submission to the registry we discovered that this promotor sequence was incorrect
507bp
BBa_K2404006
Luc+
P10500
A protein coding sequence of a gene that produces an enzyme which creates light when in the presence of its substrate, luciferin, which can be used to quantify gene expression. Prior to submission to the registry we discovered that this coding sequence was incorrect so it was not submitted. In order to generate the level 1 clones containing LUC+ ( BBa_K2404013 , BBa_K240414 ) we used a previously characterised LUC+ protein that is contained within a different (not P10500) level 0 plasmid
1653bp
BBa_P10401
NosT
P10500
A terminator from the nopaline synthase gene which is native to the Agrobacterium tumor-inducing plasmid pTiT37
285bp
BBa_P10000
LexA
P10500
An estradiol inducible promoter from the LexA gene which is native to Escherichia coli
362bp
BBa_P10003
35S-OTMV
P10500
A constitutive promoter, commonly used in genetic modification of organisms, which is native to the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus
1446bp
