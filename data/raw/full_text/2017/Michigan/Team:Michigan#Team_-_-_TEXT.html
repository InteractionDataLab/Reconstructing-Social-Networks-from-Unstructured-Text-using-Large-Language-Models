Akira Nishii is a sophomore studying chemical engineering and biochemistry at the University of Michigan. He strives to become a physician-scientist (MD-PhD) in the "near" future. Along with MSBT, he plans to conduct research on cancer immunotherapy of brain tumors (glioma) under Dr. Maria Castro and Dr. Pedro Lowenstein of the Department of Neurosurgery.
Maggie Braunreuther
Student Researcher
Maggie Braunreuther is a junior majoring in Chemical Engineering. She works in the Eniola Lab researching cell adhesion and drug delivery. Specifically, she investigates binding of vascular targeted drug carriers and their efficacy as a drug delivery method. Outside of the lab, she enjoys reading, good food, and traveling.
Erin Kokoszka
Student Researcher
Erin Kokoszka is a rising senior. She is studying Neuroscience and is planning on attending medical school. In the past she has worked in a biopsychology lab, investigating the mechanism and motivation for feeding in rats. She enjoys playing intramural sports and doing environmental service work in her free time.
Charlotte Blumrosen
Student Researcher
Charlotte Blumrosen is a senior from Paris, France studying Cellular and Molecular Biology with a minor in Medical Anthropology at the University of Michigan. She is currently studying Pulmonary Hypertension with the Michigan Clinical Outcome Research and Reporting Program. She is also currently applying to medical school in the hopes of becoming a surgeon.
Caleb Kaczmarek
Student Researcher
Caleb Kaczmarek is a junior in the University of Michigan's Cellular and Molecular Biology and Biomedical Engineering program with minors in Evolution, Ecology, & Biodiversity and Computer Science. As a member of Dr. Qiong Yang's lab in the Biophysics Department, he helps in research focused on kinases and mitosis' effects on embryonic development.
Naveen Jasti
Student Researcher
Naveen Jasti is a junior majoring in Cellular and Molecular Biology. He enjoys volunteering and conducting research on mobile elements in the human genome, and hopes to pursue an MD-PhD. On weekends and during evenings, he often gets lost in a book or plays pick up soccer.
Zoe Finer
Student Researcher
Zoe is a sophomore studying Public Health. In her free time she volunteers as a tutor for elementary students in Ann Arbor.
Nick Emery
Student Advisor
Nick Emery is a visiting researcher at Boston University in the labs of Dr. Douglas Densmore and Dr. Mary Dunlop. Currently working on mathematical modeling, automated design of repressor-based transcriptional logic circuits, and laboratory automation. Other research interests include cell-free synthetic biology, molecular diagnostics, and biochemistry.
Cristina Castillo
Student Advisor
Cristina Castillo is a recent graduate from the University of Michigan in Cell and Molecular Biology. She has been part of MSBT for three years now and is currently an advisor for the team.

Marcus Amerlaan
Faculty Advisor
Marc Ammerlaan is a lecturer in the Program in Biology. He has been an adviser to Michigan's iGEM team since 2010.
Anuj Kumar
Faculty Advisor
Dr. Kumar is a Professor in the department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology.  His research utilizes functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics to probe central signaling pathways underlying eukaryotic cell growth and function. In particular, Dr. Kumar’s work addresses a fundamental process wherein yeast cells undergo a dramatic change from a unicellular to a filamentous growth form. This growth transition is a critical determinant of fungal pathogenicity and also provides an excellent model regulatory network with relevance to ERK/MAPK signaling.
