*First of all, we must clarify a clerical mistake made on the judging form. We misread the  instructions and put the link of our new parts rather than the part we improved the function for which is part  BBa_K112806 to fulfill gold medal requirement #2.
Due to the fact that we could not find literature on the kinetics of interaction between these proteins we decided to attempt to characterize this aspect in our project. Since we decided on integrating holin and endolysin in our system, as outlined on our Project Design page, we looked to part BBa_K112805 that is part of the registry but had some major flaws. This is our improvement:
BBa_K2301000 T4 Holin:
We improved the function of part BBa_K112805 from UC Berkeley’s 2008 project by optimizing the codons for translation in E. coli using IDT’s codon optimization tool and by eliminating the illegal XbaI site that Imperial College London’s 2011 team found, making the part much easier for future iGEM teams to use. The changes we made were T358C, T556C, T563C, and T571C. We then had the gene synthesized by IDT and integrated it into our construct as outlined on our Experiments page.
