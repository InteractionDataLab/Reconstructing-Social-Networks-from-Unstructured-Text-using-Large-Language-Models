Wiki Collaboration
Learn more about our MSU Team wiki support
Michigan State’s iGEM team reached out to us after the conference that they hosted to ask for help putting some specific features into their wiki. We let them know which library was needed for a responsive animation, and helped test the design. The presentation of research cannot be overlooked, and we were happy to help Michigan State be satisfied with theirs!
Software Team - ProtoCat
Learn more about our work with Michigan's Software Team
We helped the University of Michigan’s Software iGEM team this year by testing their project, Protocat , which is a website that hosts user-submitted scientific protocols. We used several protocols from their website, testing the viability of the website and its user-friendliness. Michigan Software wants to provide a tool to make research simpler, and we--as a research student organization-- gave them feedback that we think will improve the experiences of people using that tool.
Midwest iGEM Conference

Michigan State University hosted a small conference for nearby iGEM teams on July 29, 2017. Four teams, University of Michigan Software, Carroll High School, Michigan State and our team, attended and each team presented their project design and their plans moving forward. We gave and received feedback regarding design components and potential experiments moving forward. This is AFRL Carroll High School’s first year as an iGEM member, and we gave them advice on how to best prepare for the competition.
