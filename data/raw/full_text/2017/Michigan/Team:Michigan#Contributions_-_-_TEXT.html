*First of all, we must clarify a clerical mistake made on the judging form. We misread the  instructions and put the link of our new parts rather than the part we improved the characterization for which is part  BBa_K112806 to fulfill bronze medal requirement #4.
Due to the fact that we could not find literature on the kinetics of interaction between these proteins we decided to attempt to characterize this aspect in our project. Since we decided on integrating holin and endolysin in our system, as outlined on our Project Description Page , we looked to the following part that is part of the registry but had some major flaws:
BBa_K2301001 T4 Endolysin: We improved the characterization part BBa_K112806 from UC Berkeley’s 2008 project by documenting its implementation into a temperature controlled genetic switch. We also optimized the codons for translation in E. coli using IDT’s codon optimization tool making it much easier for future iGEM teams to use. The changes we made were T508C and A511G. We characterized this gene under three different strength promoters.
We then had the gene synthesized by IDT and integrated it into our construct as outlined on our Experiments page .
