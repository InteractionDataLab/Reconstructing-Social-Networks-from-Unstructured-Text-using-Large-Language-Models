Students were responsible for every aspect of cloning, with troubleshooting help often drawn from our very resourceful mentors. The Interlab was conducted entirely by students, with troubleshooting help from Professor Ed Sander. The luciferase assays were done with equipment provided by Professor Craig Ellermeier, but the experiments were set up and conducted by students. DNA sequencing was prepared by students, with actual sequencing done at the Human Genetics Core (see below). All work was conducted with appropriate attention allocated to safety - personal protective equipment (gloves, goggles and lab coats) were work and a hood was utilized when necessary. The students really took responsibility for our project, with weekly meetings with the faculty and other consultations for troubleshooting when needed. We did not enlist the help of any companies or for-profit ventures for experiments.</P><H3 align="center">General Support</H3><P>The Iowa iGEM team is immensely grateful to their faculty advisors; Professors Jan Fassler, Craig Ellermeier, and Edward Sander, for crucial support throughout the entirety of the project - from conception to completion.</P><H3 align="center">Project Advice, Research Support, and Industrial Partners</H3><P>We appreciate the thoughtful discussion on ethics that Professor Lauris C. Kaldjian provided. Dr. Jacob Beal also provided critical feedback in the early stages of our project and Interlab work.</P><P>We are thankful to two research groups for their support of our project: For 3-HP responsive RFP plasmid from Dr. Naglis Malys and Erik Hanko ,The University of Nottingham. For recombinant 3-HP producing Bacillus strains from Dr. Ivan Mijakovic and Dr. Aida Kalantari, Chalmers University of Technology.</P><P>Regal Plastic, of Des Moines, Iowa, allowed us to tour their facility and visualize a fit for our project in industry. Also, a big thank you to LanzaTech for Skyping us and inviting us to tour their facility in Skokie, Illinois to see how our project could play a role in industrial synthetic biology applications.</P><H3 align="center">Core Services Utilized</H3><P>Thank you to the Iowa Institute of Human Genetics for sequencing services and the Roy J. Carver Center for Genomics for NanoDrop and other equipment services.</P><H3 align="center">And a Special Thank You to...</H3><P>Our generous donors who helped us reach and surpass our $3,000 goal! We canâ€™t thank you enough for giving to our project.</P><P>Adam Adnane, Seima Al-Momani, Abraham Arellano, Karlin Ariffin, Omar Aziz, Sue Bauer, Hunter Bell, David, Ema and David Caballero, Melissa Edwards, Ryan Edwards, DCI Engineers,

This is now changing! Our faculty mentors are now leading a course in synthetic biology methods, to begin next summer.</P><P>We began brainstorming our project in December 2016, but did not begin work until late May in the laboratory. Most of the early months consisted of fundraising, project brainstorming, and securing a lab space.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
