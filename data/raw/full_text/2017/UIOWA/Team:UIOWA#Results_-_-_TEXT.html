Our biobrick (mmsR/Pmmsa) is designed to luminesce, or emit off light, in the presence of 3HP. Induction of luminescence by 3HP is seen in Figure 2; all raw luminescence values divided by OD600 at then normalized to uninduced (0mM 3HP) values. However, induction only occurs when cells have been cultured in the presence of 3HP for 18 hours, and the growth curve in Figure 1 displays a dramatic lag in growth at 30mM and 40mM 3HP. Further investigation is needed to optimize the performance and design of our construct.
