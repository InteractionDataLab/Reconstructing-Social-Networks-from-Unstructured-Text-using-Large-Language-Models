BBa_K2427052 is our team's submitted basic part
3-HP responsive regulator and promoter
BBa_K2427052 codes for a MmsR, a Lys-family regulator, which is responsive to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). Addition of 3-HP to growth medium is taken up by E. coli, interacts with the MmsR regulator, and permits the accompanying promoter PmmsA to support transcription for downstream coding regions. This allows for inducible expression of proteins downstream from the MmsR-PmmsA system when 3-HP is added
