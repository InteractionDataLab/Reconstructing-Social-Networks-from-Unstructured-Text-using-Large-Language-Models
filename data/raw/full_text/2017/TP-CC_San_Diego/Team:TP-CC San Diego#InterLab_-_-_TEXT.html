Introduction
This year’s interlab study is intended to answer the main question of the relativity of fluorescence when measured at different parts of the world. To make this data more reliable, iGem has asked to test some RBS devices to make gene expression reliable and precise. For this year’s interlab study, TP-CC San Diego has decided to do the plate reader protocol along with transforming the plasmids from Kit 7.
Method
OD​600​ Reference point
Procedure:
Add 100 µl LUDOX into wells A1, B1, C1, D1 (or 1 mL LUDOX into cuvette)
Add 100 µl of H2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2 (or 1 mL H2O into cuvette)
Measure absorbance 600 nm of all samples in all standard measurement modes in instrument
Record the data in the table below or in your notebook
Import data into Excel (OD600 reference point tab)​ Sheet_1 provided
Prepare the fluorescein stock solution:
Procedure:
Spin down fluorescein stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube
Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 µM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of 1xPBS. [Note​: it is important that the fluorescein is properly dissolved. To check this, after the resuspension you should pipette up and down and examine the solution in the pipette tip – if any particulates are visible in the pipette tip continue to mix the solution until they disappear.]
Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution and resulting concentration of fluorescein stock solution 50 µM (500µL of 2x fluorescein in 500 µL 1x PBS will make 1 mL of 50 µM (1x) fluorescein solution.)

: Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate it on 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Set your instrument to read OD600 (as OD calibration setting)
Measure OD600 of the overnight cultures
Record data in your notebook
Import data into Excel (Dilution Calculation​) Sheet_1 provided
Dilute the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel (Dilution Calculation​) Sheet_1) in 12 m​l LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube (amber, or covered with foil to block light).
Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Take 500 µL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation. (At each time point, you will take a sample from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a total of 16 samples per time point)
Place samples on ice.
At the end of sampling point you need to measure your samples (OD and Fl measurement), see the below for details.
