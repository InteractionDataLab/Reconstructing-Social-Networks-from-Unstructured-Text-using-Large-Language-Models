DAY 1
SUMMARY of July 17th:
DNA extraction from GBM39 cells
Agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm DNA
DAY 2
SUMMARY of July 18th:
qPCR primer design and order
DAY 3
SUMMARY of July 21:
Primers arrived and diluted according to instructions
DAY 4
SUMMARY of August 1st:
qPCR for EGFR gene count and guide RNA design; placed order
DAY 5
SUMMARY of August 2nd:
Received oligos and diluted according to instruction.
DAY 6
SUMMARY of August 7th:
Digestion of lentiviral CRISPR plasmid
Gel purification digested plasmid using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and eluted in buffer EB
There should be two bands on the gel, one at 2kb which should not be purified. Purify only the larger band

SUMMARY of August 9th:
Anneal oligo pairs
Ligation and transformation
DAY 8
SUMMARY of August 10th:
No colonies grew on carb antibiotic plates
DAY 9
SUMMARY of August 11th:
Used same,remaining ligation reaction and transformed again onto carb antibiotic plates
DAY 10
SUMMARY of August 14th:
Inoculate comp cells
DAY 11
SUMMARY of August 15th:
Miniprep gRNA plasmids and sent in for sequencing
Start interlab study
Ludox Calibration
