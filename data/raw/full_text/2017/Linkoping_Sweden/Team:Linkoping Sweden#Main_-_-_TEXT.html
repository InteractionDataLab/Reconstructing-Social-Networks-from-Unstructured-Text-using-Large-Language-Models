About LiU iGEM:
LiU iGEM was founded in 2013 at Linköping University and has been active with different projects ever since. This year we are a group of 12 students participating, studying everything from mechanical technology to biology. The project this year aims to optimize the expression of the Alzheimer's peptides amyloid-beta and tau in Escherichia Coli. As it stands today these peptides aggregate during the synthesis which makes it difficult to get a clean product. The difficulties of synthesizing the peptides slow down the rate of research. We will study different chaperone system configurations and their role in the protein synthesis. The research will also include different parameters and their significance.
