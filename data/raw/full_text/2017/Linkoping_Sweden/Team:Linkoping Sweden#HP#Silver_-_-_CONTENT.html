disease. We are very proud of our project and eager to spread the word about our work, our
organization and the iGEM competition. Since we started this project we have joined several
events to get the knowledge of iGEM to spread. We have also been active on social media.
We have been posting pictures of the daily labwork and other events to get people interested
in our project.

LiU iGEM took the opportunity to tell them about our project and our organization. We gave a short presentation about iGEM and what we do. Thereafter we played either a game or told them a riddle.
				</P></ARTICLE></DIV><ARTICLE class="flex-text-100"><H3 class="bookmark-align" id="Linkoping_City_Festival"><I>Linköping City Festival</I></H3><P>
Every year our local town hosts a big city festival at the end of summer. The festival brings a lot of joy to both adults and kids. This year LiU iGEM decided to join the festival. Since our project focuses on Alzheimer’s disease we asked Linkoping dementia association if they wanted to join us at the festival. Together we rented a big tent for the last weekend of the festival. We had activities for all ages to reach out to as many people as possible. 
</P><P> For the younger crowd we had a mini-lab where the kids could try to grow their own colorful bacteria. We had prepared petri dishes filled with vegan strawberry jelly, some bacteria stock of colored water and of course the magical incubator. The kids got to use pipettes to dilute the bacteria stock in a test tube and then spread a few drops of their dilute on a jelly-plate. Then we put the plate in the incubator for a few seconds, when the plate came out it was covered with jelly beans which we called bacteria. We got a lot of surprised faces and laughs from both kids and their parents! They got even more shocked when we told them that the plate was edible. We used gelatin free jelly and jelly beans to make sure as many people as possible could participate in our activities. </P><P>At the festival we also lead an interactive lab with DNA purification from kiwifruit. This lab was more aimed for adults and it was very popular. Most of the people who joined in for this lab had no previous knowledge of this kind of biology, so this lab raised a lot of questions. It was a fantastic way to start conversations and to share information with the public. 

We made a <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Linkoping_Sweden/Collaborations">collaboration</A> with <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Valencia_UPV" target="_blank">Valencia UPV iGEM</A>, <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:AQA_Unesp" target="_blank">iGEM AQA_Unesp</A> and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SECA_NZ" target="_blank">SECA NZ iGEM</A> for this festival. They wrote us summaries of their projects for us to share. The public was very interested and amazed by all the things you could do with synthetic biology. Of course, the people thought it was a lot to take in and sometimes hard to understand. The teams had done an excellent job with simplifying their project description and we were ready to answer questions. A lot of interesting conversations came out of this collaboration and we are very grateful for Valencia UPV iGEM, iGEM AQA_Unesp and team SECA NZ iGEM for helping us out with this. </P><P>We learned a lot about Alzheimer’s this summer and we wanted to pass the information on. To do this in the best feasible way we made a quiz (data and corrext answers available <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Linkoping_Sweden/HP/Gold_Integrated">here</A> to find out what the public knew about the disease. The questions in our quiz are covering a broad spectrum of the general knowledge about Alzheimer’s.  We thought that when we knew what the public already knew and what they didn´t know we would decide what kind of information we wanted to promote on our website. We lounged the quiz at the festival and the Linkoping dementia association helped us to spread the word and to get people to answer. Since then we have had the link to the quiz up on our website and we have promoted the quiz on our Facebook page. 

							</P><H3 class="bookmark-align" id="International_Alzheimers_Day"><I>International Alzheimer's Day</I></H3><P>
The international Alzheimer’s day falls on September 21 and to acknowledge this day we
decided to visit one of our towns nursing homes specialized in elderly with Alzheimer’s disease. We
did this to get a better view of how people with different dementia diseases live and to see their
daily routine. Five of the members from our team met up and went to the nursing home. We were
greeted by one of the coordinators for the elderly care in Linkoping and she took the time to show us
around.

At this nursing home they had a spa were the elderly could take a bath, get their hair cut or get their
nails cut and painted.

Since patients with Alzheimer’s tend to get a loss in apatite they worked extra with that at this home.
They had a private cook who focused on making the food look extra tasty and putting some extra
thought in how they presented the food on the plates. They also had a routine of having some simple
gymnastics before lunch in the purpose of increasing the elderly’s apatite.

At Sandrinoparken the staff have a working approach called IBIC – Individual Need In Center (<I>Individens behov i centrum</I> in Swedish) – which
is a systematic way of working with person centered care. They make sure to put the individual
needs in center. The elderly staying here can decide what planned activities to attend or not and also
make requests for individual activities such as walks or spa-time.
							</P><H2>Media</H2><H3><I>Social Media</I></H3><P>By frequently updating our Facebook and Instagram account, we have allowed our followers to see how our work is proceeding. In our posts we showed different experiment from the lab. Our universe has created an Instagram account that is followed by a lot of the students and
lecturers. The purpose of this account is to let the universities different organizations to show
their work. This account gets occupied by a different society every week. We had this
Instagram account one week during the summer and will be occupying it again the week of
the jamboree in Boston. This has been a fantastic way for us to reach out to more students at
our university and to get the interest of iGEM to rise.
