Gold and Integrated Human Practices
LiU iGEM wants to see what the public know about Alzheimer's disease and dementia. We thereby created a quiz in Google Forms for the public to know what information we need to focus on for the public, so they learn new information.
A Swedish quiz was made for the Swedish public and an English version was made for the international audience. As of friday 22th September, 49 answered the swedish quiz and 28 answered the English quiz. The questions are available below including the correct answers. The Swedish answers are on the left and English answers are on the right. On mobile, the Swedish answers are above the English answers. Below most answers are some short comments of the answers given. Google Sheets was used to create the pictures of the quiz data.
The correct answers are shown in bold text.
Quick facts about Alzheimer's disease:
Around 60-70 % of people with dementia have Alzheimer’s disease.
Around 1 in 100 has Alzheimer’s disease in Sweden.
The cause of Alzheimer’s disease is formation of protein accumulations in the brain.
Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal disease.

Do you know or have known someone with dementia?
Yes, with Alzheimer's disease
Yes, with another dementia
No
Prefer not to say
A majority of the people answering the quiz know someone with some sort of dementia.
How many percent of people with dementia has Alzheimer's disease?
20-30%
40-50%
60-70%
Most people were underestimating the spread of Alzheimer’s disease within dementia.
How many people in Sweden has Alzheimer's disease? (There are about 10 million people living in Sweden)
25 000
100 000
150 000
A big majority of the Swedish answers were correct while 50 % of the international answers were correct. The incorrect international answers were mainly overestimating the amount of people with the disease.
What is this area of the brain called which is in charge of memory function?
Cerebellum
Hypothalamus
Hippocampus
The majority of the Swedish answers were incorrect, while a majority of the international answers were correct. This may be due to the Swedish average person that maybe doesn’t not know very much about the brain and its parts, while the international answers (if assumed to be mainly iGEM-participants or University students studying some biology) may explain the majority being correct.
What, except the memory, deteriorates in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease?
Motor skills, the ability to control movements
The language, the ability to form sentences
Sence, the sensitivity deteriorate
Both groups were correct. This may be due to knowledge of the course of the disease.
Are there any existing drugs against Alzheimer's disease?
No, there are no drugs available
Yes, curative drugs are available
Yes, inhibiting drugs are available
Yes, symptom inhibiting drugs are available
NOTE: Only three options were available to choose, option 3 was formulated incorrectly and was changed to option 4 which is the correct answer. This may have affected the answers.
While one of the provided answers were formulated incorrectly for a time in the quiz, this may not have affected the answers as the majority thought there were some sort of (symptom) inhibiting drug, while a few thought there were no drugs available. Also notice that no one answered that there is a curative drug available, which may also be a reason to support the (symptom) inhibiting answers.
What causes Alzheimer's disease?
Strongly increased cell division of the brain's nerve cells
Formation of fat accumulations in the brain
Formation of protein accumulations in the brain
The majority of the answers were correct. Some Swedish answers may have known the answer after we told them that at the City Festival event where they could answer the quiz.
How much of Sweden's total medical research funding goes to research for dementia diseases?
10%
20%
30%
The majority of the answers were correct.
Is Alzheimer's disease a fatal disease?
Yes
No
I don´t know
The majority were correct.
