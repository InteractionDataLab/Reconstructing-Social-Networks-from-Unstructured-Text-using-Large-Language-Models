Public Engagement
Public engagement has been an important part of this years project. It was important that the public got to know what we do, in a way that they can understand. This was done mainly during Linköping City Festival , where kids could try our mini-lab to get a understanding of how we work in the lab. We also showed the visitors how simple it is to extract the DNA from kiwi fruit with materials that are available at home, so everyone can do the same experiment.
During the festival, we also had our quiz about Alzheimer's disease available (also available from our Facebook-page and wiki) for the public, where they could try their knowledge about Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The results from the quiz is available here .
Another ways we interacted with the public were by visiting a nursing home specialized in elderly with Alzheimer’s disease during the International Alzheimer's Day .
All these events created a bridge between the general population and the scientific community that study Alzheimer’s disease and was greatly appreciated by everyone involved.
