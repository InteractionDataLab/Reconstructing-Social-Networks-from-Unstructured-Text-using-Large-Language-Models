We thereby created a quiz in Google Forms for the public to know what information we need to focus on for the public, so they learn new information.

A Swedish quiz was made for the Swedish public and an English version was made for the international audience. As of friday 22th September, 49 answered the swedish quiz and 28 answered the English quiz. The questions are available below including the correct answers. The Swedish answers are on the left and English answers are on the right. On mobile, the Swedish answers are above the English answers. Below most answers are some short comments of the answers given. Google Sheets was used to create the pictures of the quiz data.

The correct answers are shown in bold text.

Also notice that no one answered that there is a curative drug available, which may also be a reason to support the (symptom) inhibiting answers.</P></ARTICLE><ARTICLE class="flex-text-100"><H4>What causes Alzheimer's disease?
