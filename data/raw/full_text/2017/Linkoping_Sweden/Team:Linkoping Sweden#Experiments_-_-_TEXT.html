Experiments
The methods we used most during our laboratory work were New England BioLabs HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit and their instructions for restriction digest and DNA-ligation.
HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.
Set up the following reaction on ice:

If 2-3 fragments: Incubate sample at 50°C for 15 min. If 4-6 fragments: Incubate at 50°C for 60 min. Store sample on ice. Add 2 μl of assembled product to the competent cells. Mix gently by pipetting up and down. Incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat shock at 42°C for 30 sec. Incubate on ice for 2 min. Add 950 μl of room-temperature SOC media to the sample. Incubate on shake at 37°C for 60 min at 250 rpm. Warm selection plates to 37°C. Spread approximately 100 μl of the cells onto the plate and incubate at 37°C overnight. Don’t forget positive and negative control for plates.

*Thaw and resuspend T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer at room temperature.
Mix reaction gently by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly. For sticky ends: Incubate at 16°C overnight or at room temperature for 10 min. For blunt ends or single base overhangs: Incubate at 16°C overnight or at room temperature for 2 h. Heat inactivate at 65°C for 10 min. Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells.
Other methods
Gel electrophoresis with agarose.
Make 10X TAE Buffer Stock (1 liter): 48 g Tris-base 11 ml Acetate 20 ml 0,5M sodium EDTA 969 ml H20 1,5 g agarose is mixed with 100 ml of 1X TAE buffer (20 ml 10X TAE Stock + 180 ml H20). Heat in microwave to make solution homogeneous (don’t over boil). Cool solution down and then pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place. Mix samples with loading dye. Load samples and ladder to wells. Run at 90V for 80 min.

Dot-blot
For this we used Immun-StarTM AP Chemiluminescent Protein Detection Systems. Here is the instruction manual.
Lysis the bacteria with B-per Proper the membrane by soaking it with MeOH for some seconds and then put the membrane into the transfer buffer for 5 min. The membrane is then put on a filter paper which lays upon a sponge to create a transfersandwich. Transfer of proteins onto membranes and let it soak in. (if the membrane is dry, use MeOH to soak it) Soak the membrane with BSA in a bowl for 2 hours and place it on a rotating table at room temperature. Replace the BSA Blocking solution with primary antibodies. let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. Wash with deionised water. Do 3 washes with 30 ml TBST. Each wash will be incubated on a rotating table for 5 minutes. Apply secondary antibodies and let it sit 30 minutes on a rotating table for. Repeat the step with 3 washes. Do 2 washes with 30 ml TBS and let it sit on a rotating table for 5 minutes in room temperature. The membrane is covered with the substrate CDP-star chemiluminescent with enhancer. This activate the enzyme that is conjugated to the secondary antibodies. Take a picture with a CCD camera. These pictures will show the regions where the secondary antibodies have bound in. Here, the enzyme will cleave CDP-star chemiluminescent. When this happens photons will be emitted and registered by the camera.
