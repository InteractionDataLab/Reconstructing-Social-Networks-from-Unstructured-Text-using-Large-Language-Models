Team:HBUT-China/Integrated and Gold
Integrated and Gold HP
Up to now, we have investigated the public opinion about Nicke pollution and our project by questionnaires, propagated our project to the community by social activities and promoted education among students as is illustrated in Human Practices Silver. In order to get more ideas and information about our project and apply it to the current development, we conducted counselling with professors who gave us significant guidelines to our projects. These wonderful human practice experiences indeed benefit our project and we also spread the principles and ideas of our project to iGEMers all around China. Therefore, we think we are qualified for the Human Practices Gold Medal.
Consulting
During our project，we would consult professors about our project. We presented our project to them through PPT,and they would give us some advice on improving our project. For example,Prof.Dai suggested that we culture the bacteria for a longer time so that we can observe more things and get more data.
Learning
Considering that not all of our team members have a biology background,some of them are from other majors,therefore,we invited Prof.Deng to give lessons on synthetic biology to us all. We also invited students who are interested in synthetic biology as well as our project to join in the lessons and learn with us.
