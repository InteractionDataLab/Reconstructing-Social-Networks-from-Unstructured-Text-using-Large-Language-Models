In accordance with silver medal criteria #1, we have created, documented, and submitted a brand new biobrick part.This part is a composite part，in this part,there are two promoters,one is J23102,the other is Pncra.J23102 can regulate the expression of NcrB protein.When there isn’t any nickel ion,NcrB will sit on the site of Pncra,so the expression of RFP gene will be repressed.However,when nickel ion exists,it will bind to NcrB protein and change NcrB’s shape,so NcrB can no longer sit on the site of Pncra,then RFP can be expressed and we can detect it by the fluorescence spectrophotometer.
