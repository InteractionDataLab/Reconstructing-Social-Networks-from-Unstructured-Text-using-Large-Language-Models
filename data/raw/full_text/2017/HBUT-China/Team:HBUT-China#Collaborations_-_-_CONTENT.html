Since this is our first competition, they shared their experience with us.  They presented their last iGEM project to us to demonstrate the competition process, and also gave us useful suggestions on the construction of our wiki.</P><P>Because they are physically close to us, we were able to build a deep collaboration with them.  Very early in our project they supplied us with plasmid backbones and primers from the 2016 DNA Distribution Kit.  This enabled us to get started on our experiments before we received our 2017 Kit.  They made their plate reader available to us, collaborated with our interlab team, and helped us with procedures and with data comparison and analysis.</P><P>They also assisted us with modeling.  They helped us understand the SimBiology toolbox in MATLAB, and showed us how to use the computer for modeling.  They gave us the idea for the establishment of the dynamics model, and gave us a lot of advice about quasi-steady-state approximation and data analysis.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><P>copyright Â©  2017 IGEM-HBUT-China All rights reserved.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
