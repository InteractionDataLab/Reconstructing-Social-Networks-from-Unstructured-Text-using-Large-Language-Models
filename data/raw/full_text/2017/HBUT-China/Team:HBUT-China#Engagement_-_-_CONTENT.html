We introduced our project and the iGEM competition to people who came and wanted to know about our activities. We talked to them about Nickel pollution and told them the importance of protecting the environment. We also created a QQ chat group for the iGEM competition, and we put the QQ group number on the exhibition so that people interested in our project and the iGEM competition could join in the group and discuss questions.  </P><SMALL class="bigtitle">Member Recruitment</SMALL><P>OCT 13, 2017, was not an ordinary day; iGEM HBUT-China had successfully accomplished our recruitment mission for 2018's team. At that time, our team consisted of 16 members from different faculties, such as the School of Biological Engineering and Food Science, the School of Art and Design, the School of Scientists, and others, but we realized that it would not be enough for next year's team. We showed them our project and presented the iGEM competition through a PPT and our explanations. As a result, we found and recruited more people with hidden potential to join for next year. This formed our new team which has a greater diversity of cross-disciplinary professions than our present team. </P><SMALL class="bigtitle"> WeChat Official Account </SMALL><P>We created an official WeChat account to spread knowledge about synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, and to share moments of our work throughout our project. So far, we have attracted hundreds of subscribers. So we think we have fulfilled our goal of popularizing synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, and introducing our project to raise people’s awareness of pollution and the importance of protecting the environment.  </P><SMALL class="bigtitle">Questionnaires </SMALL><P>We took a poll to find out people’s opinion about heavy metal pollution. There were 140 people who took part in the questionnaire. Through this questionnaire, we found that people’s awareness to Nickel pollution was very low. And only a few people knew about biological methods to detect metal pollution. So now we think it is important for us to apply our project to daily life.</P><SMALL class="bigtitle">Learning</SMALL><P>Considering that not all of our team members have a biology background, some of them being from other majors, we therefore invited Prof. Deng to give lessons on synthetic biology to all of us. We also invited students who were interested in synthetic biology, as well as our project, to join in the lessons and learn with us.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><P>copyright ©  2017 IGEM-HBUT-China All rights reserved.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
