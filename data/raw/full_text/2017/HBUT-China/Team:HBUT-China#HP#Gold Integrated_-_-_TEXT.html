Integrated and Gold HP
So far, we have investigated the public opinion about Nickel pollution and our project through questionnaires, exposed our project to the community via social activities, and promoted awareness among students as we illustrated in Human Practices Silver. In order to obtain more ideas and information regarding our project, and apply it to its current development, we received counseling from professors who gave us important guidelines for our projects. These wonderful human practice experiences indeed benefited our project, and we were also able to spread the principles and ideas of our project to iGEMers all around China. Therefore, we think we are qualified for the Human Practices Gold Medal.
Consulting
During our project, we consulted our professors about our project. We presented our project to them using PPTs, and then they would give us advice on improving our project. For example, Prof. Dai suggested that we culture the bacteria for a longer time so that we can observe more things and obtain more data.
Learning
Considering that not all of our team members have a biology background, some of them being from other majors, we therefore invited Prof. Deng to give lessons on synthetic biology to all of us. We also invited students who were interested in synthetic biology, as well as our project, to join in the lessons and learn with us.
