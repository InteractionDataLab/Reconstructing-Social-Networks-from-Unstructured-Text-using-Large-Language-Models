Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to all engineering disciplines. The same holds true for synthetic biology, which has also been called engineering biology. However, the ability to repeat measurements in different labs has been difficult. So, through INTERLAB every team use the same exact protocol around the world to produce common, comparable units for measuring GFP with different plate readers.</P><P>This year, Interlab has provided a standard protocol for making measurements in a plate reader a flow cytometer. We are going to test some Regulatory and RBS devices (BCDs) that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable. All biobricks to be tested have been sent in plasmid form. An excel sheet has been provided, to facilitate ease of data processing.</P><SMALL class="bigtitle">PARTS</SMALL><P>We are provided with the eight plasmids containing the composite parts we will need for the Interlab Study. These plasmids include six test devices, along with two controls. For the six test devices, the GFP (E0040) and the terminator (B0010, BOO12) are common. They differ in promoter, which are J23101, J23106, J23117. The negative control only has RBS(R0040). The positive control has the other promoter (J23151) and terminator(B0032). The strength of the promoter or RBS can then be compared as it is directly proportional to the amount of fluorescence. </P><P class="imgdesc">table.1 parts of 8 biobricks</P><P class="imgdesc">Table2.variant RFP（au）</P><SMALL class="bigtitle">PROTOCOL</SMALL><P class="addbold">1.Making competent cells <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Competent_Cells">http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Competent_Cells</A></P><P>We tried twice then made competent cells with high transformation efficiency.</P><P class="imgdesc">Fig.1 1μL of 100pg/μL BBa-J04450 to transform the competent cells we made</P><P class="addbold">2.Resuspension of plasmid DNA</P><P>We resuspended DNA Distribution Kit well with 10μL dH2O, pipetted up and down several times, let it sit for a few minutes, and and the resuspension turned red.</P><P class="addbold">3.Transformation</P><P><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Transformation">http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Transformation</A></P><P>We did transformation four times because device1 was too difficult to transformhad difficulties transforming. We only produced one colony for the first three transformations. For the last transformation, we extended the heat shock to 90 seconds, successfully producing great colonies with device1. Stored all plates at 4℃ after picking a single colony.</P><P class="imgdesc">Fig.2 device1 culture after extending heat shock time to 90s</P><P class="addbold">4.Colony PCR</P><P>We picked a single colony from each plate and did a colony PCR to verify part size.
