Members
Zhengyang Chen
Hello everyone, I major in bioengineering and I am very interested in various directions of biology. I`m glad to be able to participate in this year's IGEM event and to carry out molecular biology experiments. In addition, I still like science fiction and FPS game, they are a big part of my life.
Tong Bian
Hello! I am a senior student of  bioengineering from HBUT-China. I have extensive  hobbies, for example, watching movies, listening music and reading books. I am very good at hosting. I take the responsibility of doing experiments.
Ting Hu
Hi, I am Hu Ting. As a student from Biomedical Engineering, I've always been hoping to invent something new to improve people's live condition. This year,by joining iGEM, I made my first attempt. I learnt lots of knowledge and made many good friends. I believe we can get good result with the efforts of all the team members.
Zhiyang Yao
Zhiyang has been studying bioengineering for two years. She is very interested in biology, and she thinks that genes, cells, individuals, and populations are very attractive. She hopes that her study will contribute to future biological research.
Xiangchen Liu
I am a sophomore and I major in biologic engineering. I joined the iGEM team because I thought it is fun and interesting to learn about a field outside of myself. In this team,I worked in lab group to detect OD value and fluorescence value. Then we collected these data for modeling group to draft the growth curve.
Ning Dai
I am a junior student majoring in bioengineering.I like synthetic biology because it's fascinating,and I also like travelling and playing the violin. I am responsible for the Interlab project.
Zhuyu Han
Hi,my English name.is Rosie .I am a sophomore student in Food Science and Engineering.In the HBUT-China,I am a member in the Interlab.As for my interests,I love animes、playing the guitar and Internet technology.
Wenwen Liu
Hello, my English name is Somi. I am easygoing and willing to make friends with   people all over the world. I am mainly in charge of interlab group in our project.
Chunli Peng
In the iGEM team, I am responsible for mathematical modeling and processing of biological data. In this process, I obtain the particular interest to hidden information in data. I believe that the application of math and computer methods in the field of synthetic biology is an exciting thing. So I wants to pursue a Master’s degree in data science or machine learning.
Xioapu Zhang
I am a member of modeling group.Since I am the only student who have a biological and mathematical background in this group,my basic responsibility is helping other members understand what the groups of experiment do,which is helpful for us to choose suitable models to analyze the data.
Tongyu Li
I am a member of the modeling group.I major in energy economics and I enjoy working with different professional people.I wish to set up models to describe and predict the biological reaction processes.
Yue Jiang
I am a sophomore student of science college. In my team, I was responsible for mathematical modeling with my teammates. I’m easygoing and always open my mind to others. I like to play sports and listen to music in my spare time. They make me relaxed . I'm willing to explore the hidden secrets behind the data, which is a great task. I hope our work will bring some application and reference to society.
Peining Fang
Hi! I am a senior in HBUT and I major in biological engineering. I am very excited to participate in the iGEM competition this year and I am mainly responsible for our wiki.
Qing Luo
I'm a senior from Hubei University of Technology and I feel honored to be part of the IGEM-HBUT team. For me, the accumulation of biological knowledge is limited to  high school, and I am glad to have the opportunity to learn more about it in college. I'm currently in charge of wiki page making. Because I like studying related knowledge.
Xiyu Huang
I am a freshman and I major in biotechnology in HBUT. I am glad to be part of this team. I work on the human practice in our team. I enjoy reading and learning new things.
