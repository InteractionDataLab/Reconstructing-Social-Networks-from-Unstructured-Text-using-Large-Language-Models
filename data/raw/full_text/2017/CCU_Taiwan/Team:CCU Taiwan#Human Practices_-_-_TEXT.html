Human practice Overview
In Taiwan, the health insurance system has always been a concerned issue. Not only it has the nature of insurance, but also the nature of social welfare. Therefore, we focused on how to sell our products under this national policy. So, we have done a lot of product surveys, oral status and condition survey, PMR(Potential Market Research) , online survey of Taiwan as well as foreign countries, to find out our market. In order to understand what our product condition in market, we conducted a product analysis, competitors analysis. Based on the analysis with existing products, we have built a start-up company's business model. We detailed to calculation of the first year of operating costs, and based on investigating information, we built a unique model of commercial sales, hoping to make it easier for users to access the product in their life.
