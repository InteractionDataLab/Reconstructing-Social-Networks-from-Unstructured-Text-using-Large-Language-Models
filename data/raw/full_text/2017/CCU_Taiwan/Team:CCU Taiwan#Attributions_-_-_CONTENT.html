Without the help of so many people so far, we won’t become who we are now.
Without these people supporting our dream, CCU_Taiwan would never have formed.
We are very grateful for your help, for what you did for us during this year. We believed your support will bring us success!

Q：Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course? When did you start this course?
A：As CCU_Taiwan formed the very first iGEM Team of National Chung Cheng University, things start to move, to change, gradually. Because of the formation of CCU_Taiwan, our school designed a whole new interdisciplinary course in 2017 summer. What’s more, two interdisciplinary projects were launched in the 2017 new school semester!
Q：When did you start your brain storming?
A：We started our brain storming from Oct of 2016, and we filter our ideas through the below thinking model:
What problem do we encounter by our side? -&gt; Is this problem already solved? -&gt; If not, it is because no one has done it or it is too difficult to solve? -&gt; Can we solve this problem? -&gt; Project determine!
Q：When did you start in the lab?
A：Our experiment training took place in Feb of 2017. And the actual project lab work started from Aug of 2017.
Q：When did you start working on your project?
A：Right after the project was determined in April, we started seeking the method to finish it. During this period, we managed to learn a lot of thing that is required (such as joining Taiwan MIT mini bootcamp to know more about entrepreneurship). We finished our gene design at July, and decided what software we had to build. We started rushing for our project in summer.</P></DIV></SECTION></ARTICLE></DIV></HEADER></ARTICLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
