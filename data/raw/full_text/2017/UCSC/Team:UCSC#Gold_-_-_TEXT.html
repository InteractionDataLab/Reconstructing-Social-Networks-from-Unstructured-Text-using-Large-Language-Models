GOLD REQUIREMENTS AND HOW WE MET THEM
As stated on the iGEM HP page:
<a href=" https://2017.igem.org/Human_Practices/How_to_Succeed "></a>
"Show us that your conversations with people outside the lab have influenced your project. We want to see how your iGEM project (lab design, parts selection/development, overall application, etc.) has evolved based on your Human Practices work. Think of the design/build/test/learn cycle of engineering."
