MODELING
Primary Investigators: Daniel
Secondary Investigators: Marissa, Tyler, Casidee, Evan, Khanh, McKenna, Tom, Xander, Brittney
Purpose: The purpose of modeling is to predict product yield, determine feasibility of our project, and potential ways to increase production.
J U N E
Researched nutritional information for spirulina and Synechococcus, finding many different micronutrient levels which needed to be sorted through for quality.
Investigated disease burden associated with vitamin B12, iron, iodine, and vitamin A deficiency
Determined feasibility of bio-enriching our organisms to have increased iron, iodine, and beta-carotene content.
Researched protein production rate of our model organisms by referencing growth optimization papers, finding that Synechococcus 7942 can reach maximum biomass of 1g/L in 7-10 days, while spirulina maximizes at 2g/L after approximately 15 days.
J U L Y
Determined the factors that most impacted cyanobacteria are temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron.
Put those factors into an equation matching the approximate growth rate of our organism, formated this in Javascript and plotted interactively using Highcharts.
Contacted Abraxis Bioscience about getting our samples tested, finding that it would cost around $500 per sample, projecting costs of getting our B12 conversion tested.
Found that chorismate products were primarily the aromatic amino acids, Phe, Trp, and Tyr by referencing the original NASA paper on pharmaceuticals in space.
A U G U S T
We found several different data sets with amino acid concentrations for spirulina and tried to average the most reliable sources to estimate our aromatic amino acid concentration. With these numbers, we found how many moles of chorismate are available to make acetaminophen, giving our absolute ceiling of production.
Designed a python program to analyze the genomic and ribosomal sequences of Synechococcus, processing the data to find percentages of amino acids and relying on a papers describing macronutrient ratios to estimate chorismate mols per gram.
This gave us another estimate of acetaminophen, assuming a quarter of the chorismate goes to acetaminophen.
S E P T E M B E R
To predict what proportion of our chorismate precursor would go to acetaminophen, we examined kinetic data, comparing KM ratios as an early estimate for how much of each product would be made.
Since no enzyme rates or quantities were available, we created a python program simulating the progress of each chorismate molecule along the metabolic pathway with and without our enzyme insertions.  We calibrated the python simulation to approximate actual percentages of rate times quantity of enzyme.
Calculated how much acetaminophen would be produced with the added genes, giving us another estimate using enzyme kinetics.
Reviewed the B12 pathway and read papers on conversion of bacterial form B12 to human-usable form.  Since 5,6-DMB has more than 100 times higher affinity for cobalamin than adenine, this means much of the bacterial B12 would be converted to human-usable.  With several references for inactive B12 in Spirulina, we got our first prediction of human-usable vitamin B12.
O C T O B E R
Found folate to be a well regulated pathway, ensuring that our organism wouldn’t be growth limited by folate deficiency.
Found that cobalt is a major limiting factor for cyanobacterial growth in the ocean, suggesting that cobalt supplementation could make a our organisms produce more human usable B12
More pathways research on PABA upregulation in E. coli. The research by Anderson et al encouraged us to pursue acetaminophen production in E. coli to provide evidence that our gene designs worked.
Discovered that our organism has the precursor anthranilate which can also be processed by our inserted gene 4ABH into acetaminophen. This precursor of tryptophan is one step closer to the acetaminophen end product and is more abundant than the folate precursor, giving us another estimate of acetaminophen production.

DWB3 AND DWB4 PLASMID CONSTRUCTION
Primary Investigators: Mark, Sara
Secondary Investigators: Alexander
Purpose: The goal of these experiments was to insert the bluB and nhoA gene blocks into pAM1573. These new plasmids will be referred to as DWB3 and DWB4 respectively.
J U L Y
Designed DWB3 and DWB4, as well as primers for linearization and sequencing. Ordered bluB and nhoA gene blocks, primers, and pAM1573.
A U G U S T
August 20 - The first step in constructing the DWB3 and DWB4 plasmids was linearizing pAM1573. This was done by performing PCR using primers that bound to positions 1,433bp and 1,710bp to create a 8,137bp PCR product. This was followed by a DpnI treatment to get rid of any methylated DNA (i.e. any circular plasmid that remained). To clean the PCR product we performed an ethanol precipitation.
August 23 - Performed a Gibson reaction using the bluB and nhoA gene blocks and then transformed DH5ɑ E. coli with it. The transformations were plated on LB + Chloramphenicol (170µg/mL) plates.
August 24 - There was colony growth and colony PCR showed band sizes larger than the PCR product of pAM1573 for two of the colonies (Figure 1). The colonies corresponding to lanes 5 and 9 were inoculated.
Figure 1: Colony PCR results of E. coli transformed with Gibson reaction plasmids. Lane 1: 2-log ladder. Lane 2: E. coli transformed with untreated DWB4. Lanes 3-7: E. coli transformed with untreated DWB3. Lanes 8-9: E. coli transformed with DpnI-treated DWB4. Lane 10: pAM1573 control. Lane 11: no template control.
August 24 - The inoculates corresponding to Figure 1 lanes 5 and 9 were mini-prepped and prepared for sequencing according to UC Berkeley’s sequencing specifications.
S E P T E M B E R
September 1 - After receiving failed sequencing results on DWB3 and DWB4 we became suspicious of our results. Additional PCR on minipreps from liquid innoculations of colonies 5 and 9 did not reflect our previous findings. This prompted us to perform more Gibson reactions and transformations.
September 5 -- 20 - We performed several Gibson reactions followed by E. coli transformations and consistently got no colony growth for the E. coli transformed with the Gibson reactions; meanwhile, the positive control (E. coli transformed with pAM1573) always showed growth. This led us to believe that the chloramphenicol resistance gene in DWB3 and DWB4 was somehow defective.
After taking a closer look at the sequence of pAM1573, we noticed that the terminators were incorrectly annotated in the reference maps AddGene makes available under “sequence information”; they were orientated in the wrong direction (Figure 2). Further exploration of the page identified the GenBank reference map underneath “Resource Information” contains the rrnB terminator labeled in the correct orientation.
Figure 2: Resolved annotation of pAM1573 (left) vs. AddGene “Full Sequences from Depository (1)” GenBank file that we used for reference (right). The rrnBT1 and rrnBT2 terminators are annotated in opposite directions. Both files are open source.
We believe our insert transcript was not terminated as expected since it was going in the opposite direction of the rrnB terminator, thus making a single transcript that included both our insert and CmR. This means that the transcript initiated at the AmpR promoter (at position 2,456bp) and ending at the rrnB terminator had complementarity to the transcript with our insert and CmR. It is possible that these two transcripts annealed to each other, resulting in double stranded RNA. Bacterial cells tend to destroy dsRNA longer than 30bp (since it signals a viral infection), thus destroying the transcript with CmR and causing the lack of colony growth of E. coli transformed with DWB3 and DWB4.
September 22 - To test our hypothesis of the destruction of CmR, we performed another Gibson and transformation, but this time we plated on LB + ampicillin plates (75µg/mL), since pAM1573 also has ampicillin resistance. There was colony growth on the plates containing transformed E. coli and no growth on the plate containing untransformed E. coli (i.e. E. coli without ampicillin resistance), suggesting our hypothesis was correct.
September 25 - Ordered new bluB and nhoA gene blocks containing a T0 terminator in the correct orientation.
O C T O B E R
October 7 - Performed a Gibson reaction using the new bluB and nhoA gene blocks and then transformed DH5ɑ E. coli with it. The transformations were plated on LB + Chloramphenicol (170µg/mL) plates.
October 8 - There was colony growth and colony PCR showed band sizes larger than the PCR product of pAM1573 with no insert, suggesting the Gibson reaction was successful (Figure 3). The colonies corresponding to lanes 6, 7, and 8 were inoculated.
Figure 3: Colony PCR of E. coli transformed with DWB3 (pAM1573 + bluB gene block containing T0 terminator) Gibson reaction. Lane 1: 2 log ladder. Lanes 2-5: colonies transformed with DWB4. Lanes 6-11: colonies transformed with DWB3. Lane 12: Negative control. Lane 13: PCR product of pAM1573 with no insert.
October 9 - The inoculates corresponding to Figure 3 lanes 6, 7, and 8 were mini-prepped and prepared for sequencing according to UC Berkeley’s sequencing specifications.
October 13 - Sequencing results were received and analyzed. The colony from Figure 3 lane 6 had the best results, with only one mutation (Figure 4). Unfortunately, this mutation was problematic because it occurred in sequence encoding the bluB B12 binding site (Figure 5).
To maximize our chances of obtaining an adequate DWB3 plasmid, we decided to perform another Gibson reaction as well as performing Q5 Site Directed Mutagenesis on the plasmid from the colony corresponding to lane 6.
Figure 4: SNP found in sequence of bluB insert at position 516 for colony corresponding to Figure 3 lane 6. The G to A mutation would result in amino acid change from Aspartate (negatively charged R group) to Arginine (positively charged R group).
Figure 5: Structure of protein encoded by bluB. The SNP present in the sequence from the colony corresponding to Figure 3 lane 6 was problematic because it occurred at the position encoding the B12 binding site, seen as the red spheres, and the change in amino acid charge would likely repel B12.
October 15 - Performed a Gibson and transformation the same way as was done on 10/7/17. Also, designed and ordered primers for Q5 site directed mutagenesis.
October 16 - There was colony growth for the transformation performed with the new Gibson reaction and colony PCR showed band sizes larger than the PCR product of pAM1573 with no insert (Figure 6), suggesting the Gibson reaction was successful. The colonies corresponding to lanes 2, 9, 10 and 13 were inoculated.
Figure 6: Colony PCR of E. coli transformed with new DWB3 and DWB4 (pAM1573 + gene blocks containing T0 terminator) Gibson reaction. Lane 1: 2 log ladder. Lanes 2-9: colonies transformed with DWB3. Lanes: 10-13: colonies transformed with DWB4. Lane 14: PCR product of pAM1573 with no insert.
October 17 - The inoculates corresponding to Figure 3 lanes 2, 9, 10, and 13 were mini-prepped and prepared for sequencing according to UC Berkeley’s sequencing specifications.
Performed Q5 Site directed mutagenesis on the plasmid from the colony corresponding to Figure 3 lane 6. This was used for transformation of E. coli.
October 18 - Sequencing results were received and analyzed. The colony from Figure 6 lane 9 had the best results for DWB3, with only one mutation (Figure 7). Fortunately, this mutation occurred in the rrnb terminator of the gene block insert, and thus the bluB transcript was unaffected. Both colonies for DWB4 had decent sequencing results (Figure 8). The colony corresponding to lane 10 only had one mutation, unfortunately since it was a deletion it would cause a frameshift. The colony corresponding to lane 13 showed several SNPs towards the end of the read, but fortunately they did not occur in the nhoA gene; also, the sequencing quality in this region was poor so it is possible that those SNPs are not actually there. These results show that DWB3 and DWB4 were successfully constructed.
The plates with E. coli transformed with the Q5 site directed mutagenesis reaction showed growth, but nothing was done with those colonies since the sequencing results showed that we had constructed an adequate DWB3 plasmid.
Figure 7: Sequencing result for the DWB3 colony corresponding to Figure 6 lane 9. SNP found in the sequence of the rrnb terminator of the bluB gene block insert. This mutation is unproblematic.

VERIFICATION OF 4ABH GENE ACTIVITY IN E. COLI
Primary Investigators: Tyler, Jet, Xander, Tom
Purpose: To confirm the design of the plasmid DWB2, specifically the function of the 4ABH gene, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli. However, since our gene block was codon optimized for S. elongatus PCC 7942, a Shine-Dalgarno sequence was inserted upstream of the 4ABH gene. The goal of this experiment was to verify the action of the 4-aminophenol production gene 4ABH as outlined in the Andersson patent.
