SAFETY
When choosing an organism to help us produce acetaminophen and vitamin B12 we sought out an FDA-approved microbe; however, we resorted to using a non-toxic cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942, as a model for Arthrospira platensis. A. platensis is a generally recognized as safe organism and our genes were chosen from bio-safety level 1 (BSL-1) organisms.
L A B SAFETY
Proper PPE for BSL-1 organisms are worn in our laboratory. Within the lab space, every person is expected to be wearing gloves, long pants, close-toed shoes, a lab coat, and protective goggles. All personnel also must be accompanied with one other person so that there is no one alone in lab.

VITAMIN B12
G E N E S U S E D:
I. ssuE --> produces FMN reductase
Organism: Synechoccocous elongatus strain PCC 7002
Biosafety Level I
The synthesis of 5,6-DMB first requires the presence of reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2). FMNH2 is reduced from flavin mononucleotide (FMN) by FMN reductase, which is encoded with the ssuE gene[19,20].
FMNH2 + NADP+ = FMN + NADPH
II. bluB --> 5,6-DMB synthase
Organism: Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021
Biosafety Level I
ACETAMINOPHEN
G E N E S U S E D:
I. 4ABH --> 4-aminophenol
Organism: Agaricus bisporus
Biosafety Level I
II. nhoA --> converts 4-aminophenol into acetaminophen
Organism: Escherichia coli
Biosafety Level I
