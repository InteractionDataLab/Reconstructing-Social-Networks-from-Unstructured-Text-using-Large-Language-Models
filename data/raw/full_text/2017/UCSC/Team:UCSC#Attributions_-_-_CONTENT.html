For the past four years, undergraduates at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) have participated in iGEM and that would be impossible without significant support. This year, the team is composed of students studying Bioengineering, Bioinformatics, Bioelectronics, Biochemistry, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental (MCD) Biology, and Chemical Engineering. This wide array of disciplines is crucial for the creative process behind using synthetic biology to advance solutions to problems. Modern engineering demands collaboration between individuals and pushes them to think critically and work efficiently. Through synthetic biology, the 2017 UCSC iGEM team is creating effective solutions and developing models for future success.</P></DIV></CENTER><DIV class="text-container"><H3>UCSC iGEM 2017</H3><P>Conducted project brainstorming, researched medicine production of essential medicines and supplements in cyanobacteria, researched causes for inadequate access to essential medicines and supplements, conducted modeling, conducted funding, designed parts and necessary primers,  conducted wet lab experiments and analysis, built the team wiki page, and conducted outreach events to educate and raise awareness about synthetic biology and the issue of inadequate access to essential medicines and supplements.</P><H3>Advisors</H3><DIV class="person"><B>Dr. David Bernick</B>, Assistant Adjunct Professor, University of California, Santa Cruz, Department of Biomolecular Engineering</DIV><P>Guided our team and offered valuable insight and advice through each stage of the project.
