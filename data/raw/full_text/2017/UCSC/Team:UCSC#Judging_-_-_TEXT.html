B R O N Z E REQUIREMENTS
Register for iGEM
We have registered for the iGEM Giant Jamboree and we look forward to presenting our project in Boston! We have had an amazing summer working together, collaborating with others, and reaching out to our community.
Meet all Competition Deliverables
Complete the Team Wiki
Hover over any tab in the navigation menu to learn more about our project. Or, browse our completely mobile-friendly wiki on your smartphone, tablet, or any other device! Just like the rest of our project, we always aim to improve accessibility.
Project Attributions
Check out our attributions page here to learn more about the help we received along the way!
Team Poster
We have created our project poster and will be presenting it at the Giant Jamboree.
Team Presentation
We look forward to presenting our project at the Giant Jamboree and showing how our team takes manufacturing where it has never been before.
Safety Form
With the submission of our safety form, we complete this competition deliverable. You can find our safety page here!
Judging Form
Our judging form has been submitted, and the breakdown of how we meet the medal requirements and project deliverables can be seen throughout this page. Here's a link to our Judging Form .
Registry Part Page
Our various registry parts have been fully documented and can be seen on our parts page here!
Sample Submission
DNA sequences of our parts have been submitted to the Registry to help make an even more comprehensive Registry Catalogue for next year.
Attribution
We couldnâ€™t have developed our project without the help of others. The work accomplished by ourselves and the work and support we received from others has been fully documented, and can be found on our attributions page here!
Contribution
This year, the UCSC iGEM team has contributed by participating in the InterLab study! You can see our results on our InterLab page here!
S I L V E R REQUIREMENTS
Validated Part
The validation of our own part is not only a fascinating component of our project, but is also crucial for the synthesis of acetaminophen. Take a look at how we validated our part in E. coli.
Collaboration
Collaboration between laboratories across the world will always be essential for advancements within the scientific community. Check out our collaborations page to learn more about how we worked with other iGEM teams.
Human Practices Silver
Engaging in our community and outreach to regions around the world dramatically shaped our project. Here at UC Santa Cruz, we care deeply about real world problems and what we can do to help. Take a look at the outreach we conducted.
G O L D REQUIREMENTS
Integrated Human Practices
We place an enormous emphasis on identifying real world problems before we delve into potential solutions using synthetic biology. Before we began our project, we conducted meaningful outreach to some remote locations around the world. With the information we received from multiple healthcare professionals, our project became focused on alleviating debilitating shortages in pharmaceuticals and dietary nutrients. Check out how human practices has been integrated into our project!
Demonstrate Our Work
It's not enough to only think of good ways to approach a solution to a widespread global problem -- you have to act on it too! We have gathered an enormous amount of data and demonstrated that our concept works when applied in a biological system. Check out how we demonstrated our work!
Improve a Previous Part
The tremendous registry of parts allowed us choose a part that, with some improvements, could serve a meaningful purpose in our project. The improved part has been documented and submitted to the parts registry page. Take a look at how we improved a previous part and used it as a means of detection.
Modeling
Modelling product yield is an integral component of our project. Without it, the applicability of our work becomes undermined. Modelling not only allows one to predict the yield of a desired product, but also to optimize growth conditions to maximize product yield within a given timeframe. Take a look at our modeling for acetaminophen and vitamin B12
