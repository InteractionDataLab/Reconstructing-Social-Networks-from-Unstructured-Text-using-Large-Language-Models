INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
Human practices is about understanding how our project and what we do affects the world, and how the word around us must dictate the focus of our work, and therefore our project. Integrating human practices into our work is essential, because it allows us to build and shape a relevant potential solution around a real problem.
To develop our idea, we first needed to ensure our solution would be beneficial to our intended recipients, while being specific enough to apply our knowledge of synthetic biology. We sought out widespread, real-world problems in order to take the first steps towards creating a healthier world.  Our project revolutionizes the current effort to alleviate shortages by allowing local professionals or healthcare volunteers to grow localized nutritional supplements and essential medicines with simple inputs of water, nitrogen, and saltsâ€”shifting the solution from global to local with biologically synthesized supplements and medicines of the future.
