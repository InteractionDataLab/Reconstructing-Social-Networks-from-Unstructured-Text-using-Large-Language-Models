ACETAMINOPHEN METABOLICS
"Antipyretic drugs, by being analgesics, reduce not only the fever but also the pain."
~Clinical Manual of Fever in Children
We aim to genetically modify S. elongatus PCC 7942 to produce acetaminophen, a common mild anesthetic and antipyretic recognized by the WHO as an essential medicine[1]. However, in many countries with lower regulations and faulty policies regarding drug manufacturing, acetaminophen can be synthesized with lethal toxins that result in hundreds of deaths worldwide[23].  Acetaminophen is often used in conjunction with opioid pain medications postoperatively to enhance pain relief, thus reducing reliance upon opioid pharmaceuticals[24].
Current  synthetic  biology  approach  to  manufacturing  acetaminophen  in E. coli [25, 26]. Genes 4ABH and nhoA were  inserted  to  synthesize  the  pathway  in  PCC  7942. The  gene  from A. bisporus, 4ABH, produces 4-aminophenol while the E. coli gene nhoA converts that 4-aminophenol to acetaminophen [25].
We are using a previously engineered pathway in E. coli as a model of acetaminophen biosynthesis to enhance PCC 7942[26, 25]. The pathway converts chorismate, an abundant amino acid precursor of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine, into acetaminophen with the addition ofthe 4ABH gene from A. bisporus, an edible mushroom, and nhoA from E. coli.
