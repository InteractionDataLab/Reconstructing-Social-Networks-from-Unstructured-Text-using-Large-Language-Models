Acetaminophen
To predict theoretical acetaminophen production, we calculated the amount of a precursor, chorismate, by quantifying its main products, the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.         Since no amino acid composition data was available for Synechococcus, we started by using literature data for similar cyanobacteria species Spirulina and Synechocystis and found that between one and 13.6 percent of amino acids were aromatics by mass, or between XX and YY molar percent.         To further verify our organism's amount of acetaminophen precursor, we ran both the genome and ribosomal protein sequences through a custom Python program converting codons to amino acids and calculating aromatic amino acid molar percentages which resulted in 9.3% and 5.14% respectively. (Equation/ table summing amino acids converting to molar percentage) Using our sequence generated median chorismate value of 9.3% and the assumption that our enzymes would take a third of the chorismate precursor, we got an estimate for acetaminophen concentration of between 17.5mg and 1.29 mg per gram dried biomass.         These numbers show that there is likely enough precursor and that acetaminophen production should be within a measurable range. (Equation producing acetaminophen)
