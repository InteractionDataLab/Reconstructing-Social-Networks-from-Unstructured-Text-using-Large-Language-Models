BBa_k2223000: 4abh
The 4abh gene, native to A. bisporus, allows the conversion of molecules like anthranilate and para-aminobenzoic acid to 4-aminophenol.
BBa_k2223001: nhoA
The nhoA gene is native to E. coli and allows for the conversion of 4-aminophenol to acetaminophen.
BBa_k2223002: ssuE
The enzyme created by the gene ssuE catalyzes activity that reduces the Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) by using NADH dehydrogenase as a reducing agent. This gene sequenced was optimized from S. elonagtus PCC 7002 sequence.
BBa_k2223003: bluB
The gene bluB encodes an enzyme that catalyzes an oxidized reaction that cleaves the reduced Flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) transforming to 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (5,6-DMB). The bluB sequence was optimized for PCC 7942 using the reference genome sequence from Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021.
BBa_k2223004: riboswitch
The riboswitch part contains a psbAI promoter which transcribes an mRNA strand consisting of a riboswitch and repressor gene, TetR. The riboswitch binds to vitamin B12 and regulates the expression of the downstream repressor gene. In the presence of vitamin B12, the riboswitch specifically anneals onto the cobalamin molecule inducing a conformational change within the mRNA sequestering the riboswitch binding site upstream of TetR. However, in the absence of vitamin B12, TetR is continuously expressed.
BBa_k2223005: riboswitch_reporter
The riboswitch_reporter part contains a psbAI promoter which transcribes an mRNA strand consisting of a Tet operator, TetO, upstream of the reporter gene, mRFP. The reporter is trans-regulated by a Tet repressor protein bound to the Tet operator hindering translation. In the presence of vitamin B12 the Tet systems renders useless thus, mRFP is expressed.
