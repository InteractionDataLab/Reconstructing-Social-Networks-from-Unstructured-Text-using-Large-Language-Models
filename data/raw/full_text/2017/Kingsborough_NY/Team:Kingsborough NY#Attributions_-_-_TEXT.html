The Grizzly Veterans (Original Members):
Name: Julian Zhao - The Mastermind
If you need a person who is a quick thinker and a fast learner, this is your guy. Give any messy, unorganized information to him, and he'll be able to target the important data that would lead to signficant outcomes.

The grumpy villain who is writing this. MUHAHAHAHA
Ever-present in the laboratory, she can explain any protocol forwards and backwards - and do so with different colored markers!

Presentation delivery
Name: Wendy Zhao - The Sweetheart of the Community
Wendy is one of the sweetest persons in the lab. She helps promoter our team in Kingsborough Community College, and was involved in helping our team present at Eco-Fest. Once she starts talking about our team/project you can see her passion - the audience sees it too, as she always can grab their interest!

Lab work (Support - saline experiments)
Presentation delivery
Name: Alex Dean - The Devilishily Proud Aries
In the lab, Alex is in his own element. If he looks super serious (and scary) it is  because he's thinking extremely hard. He is the type of person to think outside of protocols to get what needs to get done. He is very confident in what he does and has the talent to back it up.

New Recruits
Name: Antoine Cummins - The Promise Keeper
Antoine is a person that keeps his word. If he said that he'll meet you at 12:30 on a Wednesday, expect him to be there. He is honest and does not make any false promises. He is a hard worker and is always willing to learn.

Our Mentors
Name: Prof. Devin Camenares
He could do a little bit of everything - it's kinda scary! He was the primary mentor and gave a lot of technical advice, guidance and support. He helped guide our design of the project, and provided formatting help for the Wiki.
Name: Prof. Grace Axler-DiPerte
She gave us guidance and advice for the presentation and poster, and helped us format the poster for printing. She helped us keep track of deadlines, and always gave us support and encouragement.
Name: Prof. Sarwar Jahangir
His impressive moustache and grandfatherly wisdom gave us support and strenght during the tough times of Wiki freeze, and kept the lab open for us to complete our work (even at night!).
Special Thanks
The delta-tmRNA (ssrA::Kan-R) strain, used in the RFP characterization experiments, was a generous gift from Dr. Wali Karzai (Stony Brook)
