JUDGING FORM
Safety
Safety first! Synthetic biologists try to solve problems using biology - and can do so in new, innovative, and powerful ways. However, it is all moot if we create new problems in the process!
Safe Project Design
Our project was designed with safety in mind! If our intended project works, the bacteria should not be able to survive outside the confines of the lab
Safe Lab Work
We practiced safe lab work - gloves and lab coats were worn when appropriate (nearly always) and waste was disposed of appropriately
Our autoclave was used to prepare sterile media, sterilize instruments, and discard biological samples
Most of our work was performed in a Class-II Laminar Flow Hood - keeping our samples sterile, and preventing their spread within the room
Safe Shipment
Samples were shipped safely - samples were shipped in petri dishes or 96 well plates, either hand delivered or shipped via FedEx, wrapped in secondary containers/material (parafilm & saran wrap) and standard shipping evenlopes
