Collaboration with EpiphanyNYC
We collaborated with the nearby EpiphanyNYC team, located in Manhattan, New York City.
We sent EpiphanyNYC some DNA samples to quantify, since they have equipment we do not have access to that can accurately quantify the concentration of DNA. This will help validate our method for DNA quantification (a type of dot-blot technique using Ethidium Bromide) and test the standard curves we generated.
In return, we completed a survey for EpiphanyNYC on genetic safety.
