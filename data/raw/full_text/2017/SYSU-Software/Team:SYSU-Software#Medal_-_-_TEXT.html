Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
SYSU-Software Team has already registered in 2017 iGEM, all members work hard for the project and are well prepared for the incoming Giant Jamboree.
Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page (section 4), except those that specifically mention parts.
We’ve created a Team Wiki with beautiful design and web programming
Attributions page is on the Wiki page and all the work by team members or from other assistance were stated clearly.
Team Poster has already been printed, check it on Giant Jamboree
Team Presentation was well prepared, check it on Giant Jamboree
Safety Forms & Judging Form have been filled.
As a Software Team we don’t have new part for Registry and submission, hence no part page.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
The attribution of different part of our project is well demonstrated and the acknowledgement of help from others are also listed on the ATTRIBUTION page.
Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study.
As a Software Team, we are proud to be part of Interlab study, check INTERLAB page.
Or, document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project related to BioBricks. This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
Our project made it possible to combine two circuits together and build a model to predict its dynamic behaviour. This feature fit right with the engineering principle which iGEM advocates.
Convince the judges that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc.) performs its intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
The software we created are tested versatilely, including Wet-Lab validation and compatibility Testing. To ensure the circuits generated by our software will function as predict and the software is able to run on all platform. Check WET-LAB VALIDATION page.
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.
Check COLLABORATION page.
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfil these criteria.
This year, as we are working on our project, SYSU-Software sent a group of team members to Bio-Safety Committee office of Sun Yat-Sen University to consult the possible bio-threaten that might cause by our software and how to avoid. Therefore we developed a series of approaches preventing malicious people from creating something bad. Check SAFETY page for details.
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
Having received so many thoughts and suggestions from bio-safety and other fields, we found what our project S-Din should be improved and tried to integrate these details into S-Din design. We wrote a S-Din statement to remind users of their rights and responsibility of biosafety. We developed several functions to help users specify their ideas. We are also working on integrated database for better user experience. Check HUMAN PRACTICE/GOLD for details.
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
We construct two models in our project, i.e. Parts-Projects-Keywords Recommendation System and General Simulation System, both offering users insightful results with the help of Machine Learning and Mathematical Reasoning. As for the Recommendation System, we use techniques like Word2Vector, Random Walk, KD Tree, Collaborative Filtering, Network Analysis and so forth to explore the underlying structure of the complex relationship between Keywords and Genetic parts and offer an accurate recommendation to users based on some rigorous and comprehensive reasoning. The performance of our system is proven to be state of the art through thousands of rounds of successful tests and the positive responses from our collaborator HKUST. As for the General Simulation System, we construct a highly robust ODE system to characterize a wide range of genetic circuits created by the users arbitrarily, which can complete a rather difficult task since the variety of circuits.
Convince the judges that your project works.
The best way to prove a thing works is to use it by yourself, check S-Din and enjoy the convenience and swiftness brought by the best designed software ever in Synthetic Biology.
The features and details of S-Din are displayed on our Wiki page. How the software work? What makes it so great? What we’ve adopted to improve User experience? What more exciting features should you expect in the future? Check our project for all the details you want.
