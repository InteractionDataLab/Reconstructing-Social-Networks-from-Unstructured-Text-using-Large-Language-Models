          As a software team, we felt obligated to help other team with our expertise in software development and data processing. Besides, for experiments aspect, we thought we have plenty of experience to learn from others. Thus, we decided to join the community vigorously and reached out for 4 registered teams this year in traditional tracks: <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations#scut-china-a">SCUT-China_A</A>, <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations#nju-china">NJU-China</A>, <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations#hkust">Hong_Kong_HKUST</A>, and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations#sysu-china">SYSU-CHINA</A>. And we also worked with <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations#scau-china">SCAU-CHINA</A> who will participant iGEM next year (They conduct their project for two years) for holding a synthetic biology conference on their campus.

This year they use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow.

        At the very beginning of this year around the end of March, NJU-China got interested in weight -reducing drugs. They noticed that people may use various emojis when it comes to topics related to “losing weight”, “body weight”, “fat” on their microblog. Some people may be eager for practicing their body so a very positive emoji would be used on their microblog while others are totally opposite. Out of an objective perspective, some big data was needed to scope a general relationship between the three keywords and the emojis used by microblogers under the analysis of statistics. As a result, they reached out for us.
      </P><H4>Solution &amp; Results</H4><P>
        In this case, we built a python spider for them to extract big data to dig out the relationship between the three key words they wanted and emojis that people post on the social microblog media, specifically on WEIBO, in the last whole year (2016.1.1-2017.1.1). All the robot abstractor we built has been under the regulation of “<A href="http://weibo.com/signup/v5/protocol" target="_blank">Robots Protocol</A>” file stated by the official WEIBO company on their website.
      </P><P>
        After couple of online discussion, the total 17 emojis related to the three words on microblog database were classified into 5 sorts: “Happy”, “Sad”, “Upset”, “Helpless”, and “Others”.Two conclusions can be drawn from the data. First is that 53% of people tend to use negative emojis when they mentioned “losing weight”, “body weight” and “fat”, which reveals about half of the population dislike the process of losing weight. Second is that the emoji “crying” is the commonest emoji, about 17% among all types of emojis, when people’s microblogs contain words related to losing weight or fat. This conclusion reinforced the first conclusion that losing weight is actually a quite annoying process where half of our people may have trouble on different levels.
      </P><P>
        This background analysis laid a solid foundation on their project motivation this year. By confirming with positive relationship between bad emotions and loosing weight, they conducted a project for producing weight-reducing drugs by engineered organism which may greatly innovate the way we deal with the weight losing matter.

        Figure 1. Data analysis in pie chart. We can see from the chart that “crying” is the most mentioned words when it comes to losing weight.

        Figure 2. Another pie chart reveals that about half of the emojis are negative when it comes to the three words.

        During the collaboration, NJU-China tried our software when we released our origin version to them and gave us helpful feedbacks based on which we improved our UI and operating logic of design platform. Additionally, they also give us valuable advice on Interlab Study.

So we met together and collaborated with each other in Sep and Oct. </P><P class="center fig-ep">

      </P><H4>Solution &amp; Results</H4><P>
        Serving for the goal to help everyone who is interested in Synthetic Biology generating their idea rationally, we managed to provide a visualization tool for presenting the relationship between projects and hot topics. Each blue node stands for a topic key word and other nodes in different colors stands for team’s previous work in different tracks. Teams who shared the same key words of topic would be connected to the same blue node where the words of the topic will emerge above the node when it is single-clicked. It has the same operate logic when it comes to the teams’ nodes which will jump to their own wiki when clicked. The connection data was provided by HKUST.</P><P>
        This visualization tool can be tried on <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong_HKUST/Collaborations">HKUST’s wiki</A>. The code to utilize this function can be found on our github <A href="https://github.com/VinaLx/IGEM-graph" target="_blank">repo</A>.

        Our software focus on search and design which highly relies on users’ feedbacks. We asked HKUST to use the our software and got a positive feedback. They said they struggled a lot when they brain-stormed at first and found it’s hard to find the synthetic biology work with similar topic straightly and connectively, which is also why they want us to build a visualization tool for them, actually for the whole community. Besides, since the programmer in their team has a strong background in Computer Science, whom win the Gold Medal of International Olympiad in Informatics(IOI), we also discussed a lot on the backend and algorithm of our project, which turned out to be quite helpful for both of us. Besides, we also visit their lab and got some advice on the experiments implementation.</P><P class="center fig-ep">

        Figure 6. We visited their lab in HKUST and discussed about the experiments in Synthetic Biology, especially the Interlab Study and the main projects. Ideas of standardization and other engineering principles have been fully understood and applied by each team in the process of wet lab implementation. However, we also talked about the phenomena on regulation leaking and other unpredictable aspects in biology experiments where we encouraged each other for further research and study.

        It’s quite admiring for the outstanding performance of SCAU-CHINA last year in iGEM. This year, we are very pleasant to reach out to them and got several meet-ups during the whole year. We exchanged our ideas on plenty of aspects such as the importance and the tendency of Synthetic Biology, the experience on running a well-organized team and so on. We managed to collaborate on holding a synthetic biology meeting on their campus and introduced our software to the public. Additionally, we also visited their lab and guide them to tried our S-DIN project for search and design process. They shared the same concern with us on the information integration matter and gave us positive feedbacks on the user-friendliness aspect and our simulation functions. For their next year project, they said they will use our software for the pre-brainstorm inspiration and the design process in order to save plenty of time for detouring around aimlessly.
