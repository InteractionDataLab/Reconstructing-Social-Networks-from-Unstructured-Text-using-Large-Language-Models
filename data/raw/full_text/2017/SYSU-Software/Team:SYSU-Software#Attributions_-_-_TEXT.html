Synbio is just a S-Din away!
SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
Part of the team have worked together long before the initiation of the project. We held each otherâ€™s back, pushing our own limit to bringing every one of our imagination into reality. All the team members did their job perfectly with passions. Click Group Structure and Attribution in Project to find out how our team organized this year. Besides, we also want to appreciate the miscellaneous work done by our team members for our Journey planning and Financing .
Our team is financially under the support of School of Life Science, Sun Yat-Sen University. During the project, variety of institutions and individuals, not only our instructors and advisors, in and outside the School of Life Science have offered us plenty of assistance, here we present our sincerely gratitude to all these generous help.
