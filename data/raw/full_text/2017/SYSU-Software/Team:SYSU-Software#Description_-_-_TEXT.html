SYSU-Software
Description
iGEM has been doing well. Synthetic biology has also been developing fast. But this thriving field and community, and their merits and inspirations, still cannot be easily accessed and fully appreciated by all of their enthusiasts. Existing synthetic biology solutions, created and elucidated by veterans, have been proved extremely inspirational to any SynBio enthusiasts. They want to create projects applying synthetic biology and tackle with various problems on our planet. However, they are held back by the inefficiency of data archiving we currently have. Our project aims to bridge the gap. This web-based, manually and algorithmically curated archiving and searching platform is to integrate the ideas and solutions from all validated iGEM projects, and render them intuitively accessible to users. Core data will be presented in a standardly formatted interface, which enables efficient yet accurate information mining. Our users will be greatly inspired by many genius solutions targeting real-world challenges, and be able to bring forward their own fully-fledged concepts and practices. In addition to this archive and search engine, there is an integrated auxiliary tool for designing genetic pathways. Users can readily drag those biological parts mentioned in search results into this tool, modify and improve the pathway, to yield new pathways with aimed functions. Other integrated functional modules, including bookmarks, sharing, and smart recommendation, will also help to deliver great functionality as well as great user experience.
What should this page contain?
A clear and concise description of your project.
A detailed explanation of why your team chose to work on this particular project.
References and sources to document your research.
Use illustrations and other visual resources to explain your project.
Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
