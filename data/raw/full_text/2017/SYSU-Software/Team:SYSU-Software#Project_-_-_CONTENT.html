              This year, SYSU-Software is trying to ameliorate this situation in Synthetic Biology, exploring treasures buried in the ocean of projects.
            </P><P>
              To make a full use of our predecessors' geniuses and efforts in Synthetic Biology. We concluded two problems.

              iGEMers have been complaining that tackling obstacles in a project is doable, but deciding what to do is exasperating. Catching your muse is like grabbing swirling smoke. 
               We extend S-Din further, not only satisfying the need of starting a project but also guiding you to a clearer path.
               Therefore, the tree of words and interaction analysis are developed to inspire users. Part of the reasons we have made searching and designing seamlessly is to enable you to start designing once you catch your eureka moment.
               And here comes S-Din, to inspire you, to do more in Synthetic Biology.

We‘ve always wanted to make a difference in Synthetic Biology. With the help of our search engine, our users are able to examine previous projects and view at a different angle, and will be inspired by it. The gap between searching and designing are now gone. Once you catch the muse, your design can be done instantly.
            </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subsection design"><H4>Database</H4><DIV class="page-content"><DIV class="paragraph"><P>
              We collect data from many channels, most of the previous projects data and all of the Parts data come from the iGEM. Projects published in articles are collected on various synthetic biology Journals. Usage permissions are granted by the publication groups. 
            </P><P>
              All of these are stored in S-Din database so that we can satisfy the need of our users to design a Synthetic Biological project.
            </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subsection design"><H4>Specialty</H4><DIV class="page-content"><DIV class="paragraph"><P>
              Even though the exponential increase of published papers is a field-wide phenomenon no only limited in Biology, we try to provide an experimental and innovative solution specialized for Synthetic Biology instead of a general solution. S-Din is built specifically for Synthetic Biology, allowing you to view previous projects and work in a standardized manner. S-Din surpasses Google on the Specialty in Synthetic Biology, seamless searching and designing and its unique way to inspire users.  

            </P><P>
              When you search on S-Din , we provide network analysis services to help find your targets faster, and also try to inspire you. Once you find your preferred project, you are able to edit it simultaneously on our design platform. More parts can be added by the search tools provided on the left, or you can just drag in circuits that you bookmarked into your favorite before. The design can be uploaded, downloaded or shared for collaborations between different accounts. Once you finish the design, you can run simulation program to check if it works well and then export it as plasmid and we will generate the DNA sequence for synthesis.
            </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subsection design"><H4>Algorithm</H4><DIV class="page-content"><DIV class="paragraph"><P>
              The users of our software are all innovative researchers who are interested in utilizing Synthetic Biology to tackle many different real-world problems. The purpose of our system is to recommend the most related genetic parts to the users based on users' research interest detected by our system. 
            </P><P>
              The information we use to make recommendations is based on a database powered by NLP and Random Walk, which contains scores between each keyword and each genetic part. Formally, it is a matrix consisting of the number of keywords and the number of Parts. The element at the row and column is the score between the keyword and genetic Part that can reflect the connection between them. (Higher score suggests stronger connection).
            </P><P>
              The overall strategy of our system is Collaborative Filtering, i.e. we first search similar keywords in our database of the unknown word offered by users, then recommend genetic parts which are highly related to those keywords that are suggested for users.
            </P><P>
              How to find the most similar keywords in our dataset of a given unknown word in an accurate and efficient way? Here is our general solution: To quantify the semantic similarities between words accurately, we use techniques in Deep Learning to convert words into numerical vectors and the cosine similarities between each vector can represent the semantic similarities between words. To search the similar keyword efficiently, we use the KD Tree Algorithm, a speedy algorithm based on the binary tree, to implement the K Nearest Neighbors strategy.
            </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subsection design"><H4>Network Analysis</H4><DIV class="page-content"><H5>Search analysis</H5><DIV class="paragraph"><P>
              At scientific journals, keywords are often required for publishing articles. Keywords can be used for indexing or searching, and offer a faster way for readers to browse the content of a project and find their interests. 
            </P><P>In fact, in 2015, iGEM try to collect some <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Keywords" target="_blank">keywords</A> by asking teams to submit.
            </P><P>
              This year, a new data format is created and its keywords enable our network analysis. First, We used <A href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/" style="padding:0">Microsoft Text Analytics Service</A> to extract keywords from wiki texts of previous projects. Only the most frequently used keywords will be focused. By using machine learning, those keywords were converted to word vectors base on a semantic database. A network profiling relationship among keywords, projects and parts data is built and stored in the S-Din database. When searching, related information will be provided based on the network analysis, which would spark a brand new idea unexpectedly.
            </P></DIV><H5>Interaction analysis</H5><P>
            When you use interaction analysis for a Part on the design platform, any other parts or protein that might interact with the chosen part will be displayed and can be added to the platform. We had built an interaction database ourselves, the sources of data were iGEM Registry and STRING Database. Scores for parts come from the STRING Database.
          </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="subsection design"><H4>Simulation &amp; Plasmid Design</H4><DIV class="page-content"><P>
            S-Din allow our innovative users with fascinating idea to combine various genetic parts together to form a brand-new genetic circuits that may never exist before.To help them have a deeper understanding of how the genetic system that they created works, we construct an ODE system to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the genetic system mathematically. The main challenge of simulation is the uncertainty of genetic circuits since the users can construct them arbitrarily. Therefore we built a rather generic model capable of simulating various genetic circuits.
          </P><P>
          After your Design, you can choose to convert your circuits into Plasmids (Customizable) for further synthesis.

The bacteria had been broken by ultrasonic crusher, and then we used the OD588 to measure the concentration of the blue protein (Photo. 4).</P><DIV class="double-pic"><DIV class="pic"><P class="fig-ep center">Photo 3.

Expand the scale of our database.</H5><P>Projects in iGEM and literature field are grow at a remarkable speed, thus it's a responsible for us to update the data in our database regularly so that our users can catch the latest ideas and utilize into reproduction and testing. In next year, every team and publisher will be invited to redraw their genetic circuit on our design platform for seamless reutilization in future works, which is the most fastest and accurate way we can imagine for expanding the database. For display aspect, a wiki plug-in tool of S-Din will be developed so that all the teams next year can using the same editable tools in their wiki so that no more PS will be needed and also benefit us for gathering data from the first hand.</P><H5>2. Evaluating an uncarried-on project by Artificial Intelligence.</H5><P>In the future, we are going to adding a crowdsourcing feature in our software. To evaluate the project, a reliable auto-judging system will be created. The evaluation system will not only consist of simulation results but also variety of aspects that may affect the reliability of a project to function well (not only for Competition Awards but also for TRUE scientific &amp; social effect it has). Machine learning and other method in big data mining area will definitely be used in the coming feature.</P><H5>3. More validation experiments and feedbacks.</H5><P>According to basic principles of engineering, iteration of the design-test-redesign circle for a product could never be enough. More efficient and user friendly features will be added during our further human practice in Synthetic Biology field. In our human practice section, we have demonstrate how we gain the idea of S-Din and how we enhanced it during the summer. We will do the same job for future improvement of S-Din, to make S-Din more popular and well-featured.</P><H5>4. Dynamic data flow for synthetic biology.</H5><P>During the brain storm, we want to add the feature that can provide dynamic data (news, latest paper) which can automatically upgraded everyday. Due to the limitation of time, we didn't merge this function into our software. In the future, these feature will be also added.</P><H5>5. System optimization of the whole genome with the inserted circuits.</H5><P>As a software team in synthetic biology, we felt responsible to build a software that can truly utilize the power of computer and algorithm to manage synthetic biologists  to accomplish important and complexed tasks. After circuits getting used seamlessly from search results, an consideration of the genome level are going into our sight. As the electronic system, performance and connection can be optimized to a most efficient or robustest way. </P><P>S-Din is the first step of our ambition to solve real synthetic biology problem based on which further project will have a ground foundation of data collection.</P><P id="more">And more</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><DIV id="contact"><DIV id="contact-content"><DIV class="contact-item"><DIV class="contact-heading">contact</DIV><DIV class="contact-value">sysusoftware@126.com</DIV></DIV><DIV class="contact-item"><DIV class="contact-heading">address</DIV><DIV class="contact-value">135# Xin'gang Rd(W.)Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China</DIV></DIV><DIV class="contact-item"><DIV class="contact-heading">GET IN TOUCH</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
