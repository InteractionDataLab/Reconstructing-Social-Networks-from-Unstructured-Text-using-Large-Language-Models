SYSU-Software 2017
Overview
This year, 2017 SYSU-Software team members are up to 26 to satisfy the need of a grand project. Each one of them are the best of their own major. From sophomore to senior, the members come from school of Life Science, Date and Computer Science, Mathematics, Communication and Design, Electronics and Information Technology.
Our instructors Prof. Yang Jianhua and Prof. Ren Jian gave their professional advice on how to design a software and running a project. Other advisors and professors from Sun Yat-Sen University also offer precious suggestions. Our previous iGEM Team members showed their experience that help us a lot.
