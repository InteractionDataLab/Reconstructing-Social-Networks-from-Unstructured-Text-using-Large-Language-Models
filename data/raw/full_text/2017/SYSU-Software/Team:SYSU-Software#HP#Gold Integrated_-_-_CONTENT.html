or to overturn our hypothesis. Then we tried to integrate them into our final project in order to improve the project functions and user experience. </P><P>At the beginning of our project, in order to get answers to questions about user needs, safety, software regulations and legal issues, we conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. They gave us useful and significant suggestions (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Silver">Silver page</A>). We have considered all comments from professionals and integrated them into our design of S-Din (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated">Gold Integrated page</A>). We conducted further user interviews and user needs analysis, promoted S-Din and synthetic biology to the public (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Engagement">Public Engagement page</A>). </P><P>Please see our human practices highlights during the entire product development on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated">Gold and Integrated Human Practices page</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><SECTION class="plain" id="gold"><H2><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated">Gold</A></H2><DIV class="paragraph"><P>When designing the project we have come up with many fine details for the software.

In our &quot;Integrated Human Practices&quot; page, we'll show essential human practices work we have done around S-Din, including user needs analysis, function improvement for user feedback, product assessment, and public promotion.</P><H3>User needs analysis</H3><H4 id="nju-practice">Study the needs of other iGEM teams &amp; ordinary bio-lovers</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>In the discussion with SYSU-CHINA iGEM team and SCAU-China iGEM team, we reached an agreement that fragmented data makes it time-consuming and laborious to collect and reuse data. (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Silver">Silver page</A>)</P><P>Nowadays data or information online is abundant but scattered. Many people spend much time on integrating them by themselves. instead of spending more time on their ideas for their core work. </P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 13: How a man may assign his time in a project when getting integrated data by himself</P><P>In fact, this trouble is possible to be solved ---- by a dedicated software. If we could establish an integrated database, consisting of a unified standard of data composition and data format, we should find out the relationships among the data more easily. Besides, a data format standard makes it more convenient and engineering to store, reuse and combine the data. And engineering work is what computers are good at. </P><P>So our team desired to change the workflow into the figure below: </P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 14: How a man may assign his time in a project when getting integrated data with a dedicated software.</P><H4>Study the needs of ordinary bio-lovers</H4><P>At the same time, we chatted with some students who are interested in biology work. They told us: </P><P class="quote">&quot;We'll like the software if it shows details of each bio-project, in a way easy to understand.&quot;</P><P class="quote">&quot;It would be better if the software can provide a basic analysis of the work.&quot;</P><P class="quote">&quot;Could you develop a software which can recommend interesting projects of my own?&quot;</P><P class="quote">...</P><P>We found that the needs above are the most popular. To achieve these goals, an enough huge and integrated database is critical. Of course, mathematical algorithms should be equipped with our software. </P><H4>Studying the needs of biology labs</H4><P>During the summer, we visited several biology laboratories of Sun Yat-sen University. Researchers warmly greeted us. Thanks to Prof. Lu Yongjun's help, we finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory. Meanwhile, we chatted with the researchers and conducted a small survey of their project idea. </P><P>By talking with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project. </P><P><SPAN class="quote">“A good beginning is half done. That is to say, a good idea of a genetic circuit design is half done of the whole project.”</SPAN> A researcher named Dong told us. </P><P>Since ideas are so significant to a project, where do researchers' ideas usually come from? We did a small survey of researchers in several labs. </P><P class="fig-ep">Figure 15: The sources distribution of researchers' project idea.</P><P>From the figures above, we learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals ---- <SPAN class="bold">they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction.</SPAN> However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work. </P><P><SPAN class="quote">“We all hope to stand on shoulders of the giant, but it's hard at this stage to combine or transfer the senior's ideas in order to form my own ideas.”</SPAN> Researcher Dong said. </P><P>How to trigger one's inspiration? What if our software could help people with inspiration? This &quot;Inspiration&quot; inspires all of us. However, it is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure and specify. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software. </P><P>Thanks to the inspiration flashed across our mind, we decided to create an onomatopoeia &quot;S-Din&quot; as the name of our project and software, as it sounds like turning on a bulb. </P></DIV><H3>Needs &amp; Functions Integration</H3><P>Here are S-Din's core functions we developed for users' needs.</P><H4>Integrated database</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>In S-Din's database, we standardize a new data format for different types of data: parts, projects, keywords and papers.

Only 26 parts are tagged.
