or to overturn our hypothesis. Then we tried to integrate them into our final project in order to improve the project functions and user experience. </P><P>At the beginning of our project, in order to get answers to questions about user needs, safety, software regulations and legal issues, we conducted numerous interviews with professionals working in related fields. They gave us useful and significant suggestions (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Silver">Silver page</A>). We have considered all comments from professionals and integrated them into our design of S-Din (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated">Gold Integrated page</A>). We conducted further user interviews and user needs analysis, promoted S-Din and synthetic biology to the public (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Engagement">Public Engagement page</A>). </P><P>Please see our human practices highlights during the entire product development on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated">Gold and Integrated Human Practices page</A>.</P></DIV></DIV><SECTION class="plain" id="silver"><H2><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Silver">Silver</A></H2><DIV class="paragraph"><P>During the project, we brainstormed many aspects concerning our project. These aspects can be roughly divided into two basic problems:</P><OL style="font-size:1.3rem"><LI style="margin:1rem 0;"> What advantages will our project have to raise scientists’ ideas, which may lead to a wonderful genetic design? Or what to raise ordinary bio-lovers’ interest, which may attract them to learn more about synthetic biology?</LI><LI style="margin:1rem 0;">What impacts will our project have in different fields of society?</LI></OL><P>Through discussions, interviews with professionals or scholars in different fields, and searching related policies, we had a better awareness of our project in the context of scientific inspiration, societal attention, safety and security, and legal considerations. These inspirations help us improve our S-Din a lot.</P></DIV><H3>Interview with other iGEM teams and ordinary bio-lovers</H3><H4>Motivation</H4><P>Every product (including a software) is designed for users' needs. We hope to learn about what problems other iGEM teams meet and to analyze what they need to solve their problems. What’s more, the intention of ordinary amateurs is also supposed to be taken into account.</P><H4>Practices</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>This summer, we cooperated with SYSU-CHINA iGEM team in many activities in our campus. (See <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Collaborations">collaboration page</A>) We also exchanged our ideas on Synthetic Biology and iGEM frequently.</P><P>One day, we conducted a discussion among members from us, SYSU-CHINA and SCAU-China, with the topic of data collection and integration. All participants agreed that data and information online are so scattered that we have to spend much time on collecting it and reusing it. </P><P>SYSU-CHINA hoped to solve this problem and put the hope on us software team. We regarded the fragmented data as a problem, too. So we started to conduct further investigations and interviews on it. More details can be found on our<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated"> Integrated Human Practices page. </A></P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 1. The discussion among SYSU-CHINA, SCAU-China and SYSU-Software.</P><P>At the same time, we chatted with some students who are interested in biology work. They told us, “We’ll like the software if it shows details of each bio-project, in a way easy to understand.”</P></DIV><H4>Inspirations on our project</H4><P>From our investigations and interviews, we found that an integrated database is very important for an iGEM team, also for a research group. Our software is supposed to establish such a database in a standard and easy-to-understand format. It will save one's time, which enables one to focus on his project ideas.</P><H3>Studying the needs of biology labs</H3><H4>Motivation</H4><P>Apart from iGEM teams, biology labs and other biotechnology institutes have more rights to speak from a genetic circuit design in papers to a practical experiment protocol in labs. It is also very interesting and exciting to meet them who will be most likely to be affected by our project imagine.</P><H4>Practices</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>During the summer, we visited several biology laboratories of Sun Yat-sen University. Researchers warmly greeted us. Thanks to Prof. Lu Yongjun’s help, we finished our interlab task and wet-lab validation in his laboratory. </P><P class="fig-ep">Figure2: Our team member Wang Ziwei is introducing our project idea to researchers of LU laboratory.</P><P>By talking with researchers working in the lab, we were surprised that lack of ideas is one of the common problems when they work on a synthetic biology project.</P><P>Since ideas are so significant to a project, where do researchers’ ideas usually come from? We did a small survey of researchers in several labs. Check <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/HP/Gold_Integrated">Integrated Human Practices</A> page.</P><P>We learned that the majority of researchers’ idea source is professional research articles and journals, they work before, but a novel idea may arouse from them if the researcher reuses their essence and aims to an accessible direction. However, each paper usually describes its design in the author’s own style and standard, which is usually hard to understand and absorb its design ideas for one’s own creative work.</P></DIV><H4>Inspirations of our project</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>How to come up with an idea or to trigger one’s inspiration is a challenge for us, because “inspiration” is such an abstract concept, and is hard to measure. But hope is still alive: several related previous works may create a new idea. To find out related projects and to guide users to a clearer direction, are what we consider to achieve in our software. </P></DIV><H3>Learning related policies</H3><H4>Motivation</H4><P>To know more policies which may affect our project, and to discuss the questions we don't understand in policies.</P><H4>Practices</H4><P>We searched the related safety policies on iGEM website. We got together and discussed any problems if we couldn't understand the policies. Especially, we discussed the biosafety issues and different risk groups.</P><H4>Inspirations on our project</H4><P>The risk group of chassis is one of the safety standards to assess the chassis. Besides, whether a part is attached to &quot;Red Flag&quot; tag or not is another way iGEM uses. As an intact software for synthetic biology, S-Din should engage this function. </P><P class="fig-ep">Figure3: We are discussing biology safety.</P><H3>Consulting the Biosafety and Ethics Advisor</H3><H4>Motivation</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>How to guide the public attention to bioethics and biosafety is the urgent need before we design and develop our project. We are particularly concerned about one question:</P><P><B>What are biosafety risks easily ignored by us in a virtual genetic design in the computer?</B></P></DIV><H4>Practices</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>In September, our team visited Prof. He Zhumei, a biosafety advisor from Biosafety Committee of Sun Yat-sen University. He not only researches biology but also devotes to guiding the public to bioethics and biosafety.</P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 4: Prof. He Zhumei is explaining biosafety for us.</P><P>Prof. He was surprised by our visit. He said it was commendable for us to consult biosafety problems. Half an hour of happy communications, Prof. He patiently answered our confusion, and gives a lot of new aspects to think about the perspective of bioethics.</P><P>Prof. He emphasized the signification of biosafety awareness, and the real biosafety is supposed to be reflected in each step of the operation. As a development team for biology software, it is our responsibility to remind the users to follow safe and reliable design principles and to warn the users of dangerous operations. This proposal from Prof. He gave new inspiration to us.</P></DIV><H4>Inspirations on our project</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>After the consult to Prof. He, we realized that we have more responsibilities of biosafety warning and guiding. What’s more, it would be better if we establish a way of communication with users.

Although we’re non-profit all the time, we are still supposed to consider intellectual property issues.</P></DIV><H4>Practices</H4><DIV class="paragraph"><P>We consulted Prof. Li Yang on intellectual property issues. Prof. Li was from School of Law, Sun Yat-sen University, researching laws of intellectual property. We introduced the specifics of the literature citation to Prof. Li. He carefully helped us understand the citation terms and conditions, and explained how the paper license works. With his help, we make sure that we’re approval to use every paper and every iGEM project in our database.</P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 7: Photo with Prof. Li Yang.

From the original inspiration to the real software product, our software can't be born without continuous communication and timely feedback with public and all related fields. We are deeply impressed by the power of human practices. Although this version of S-Din is not perfect, we'll continue to create a better product.

Further, we should never “work behind closed doors” — though non-technical individuals may lack knowledge about synbio, they might provide us with many sparkling ideas and inspirations on our projects -- That's also S-Din's goal. More importantly, if our project is hardly understandable to the general public, then it cannot be a successful one. If we can establish a bi-directional communication with the public, we can get more feedback on our project and, based on the feedback, we can make our project more accessible not only to the scientists but also to the public.</P><H3>Biology Festival: introduction synthetic biology to public</H3><DIV class="paragraph"><P>Collaborated with SYSU_CHINA iGEM team, we held a parade in the campus to introduce synthetic biology to the public. Our audiences included students of life sciences and many other majors, teachers of different backgrounds, and residents in the campus who are neither students nor teachers. Our parade includes 2 parts: Design a circuit; Project sharing.</P><P>As for the “Design a Circuit” part, we designed a funny game. The participants were allowed to design gene circuit based on the genetic parts provided by us for specific purpose. At first, we thought this game would be very easy. All they need to do is just put the genetic parts in the right orders to complete a circuit. The situation, however, is quite different from what we expected. We explained to them what the promoter is, but it was so hard for them to understand, not to mention completing a circuit. Since most of the students lacked related knowledge, few students attended this game. And those who attended this game required a lot of hints to finish the circuit.</P><P>In terms of the “Project Sharing” part, we presented the project of 2015, CORE. We demonstrated the function of our software. They also gave us some suggestions.</P><P>&quot;Although I can't understand more about synthetic biology, I still feel very interested in your work and ideas.&quot; To our surprise, a student told us when the Biology Festival ended.</P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 20.Many people are attracted by our parade in Biology Festival. </P><P class="fig-ep center">Figure 21.Group photo with SYSU-CHINA.</P></DIV><H3>&quot;Bio-Lab Rescue&quot;: game promotion</H3><DIV class="paragraph"><P>In many people's eyes, synthetic biology is mysterious and hard to understand. We hope to change this situation. We think synthetic biology is also funny and easy to get close to ordinary people — if we integrate the principle of synbio into online games.</P><P>In the summer, our team designed and developed a game &quot;<A href="http://sdin.sysusoftware.info/game/">Bio-Lab Rescue</A>&quot;. We hope to spread synthetic biology in a funny way. And we promoted the game around our university, and posted its URL on social medias.</P><P class="fig-ep">Figure 22.Bio-Lab Rescue Game</P><DIV class="paragraph"><P>Obviously many students were attracted by the game. They were very excited and gave much advice to us about improving the game experience. When we asked the players if they realized the topic we wanted to tell them, a player said yes and described what he learned from our game, which encouraged us a lot. However, he is the minority who can understand the game. We should think more about the combination of knowledge and entertainment, and how to spread synthetic biology.</P></DIV></DIV><H3>Mini lectures for freshmen &amp; high school students</H3><DIV class="paragraph"><P>We held several mini lectures for freshmen and high school students. In these lectures, we introduced our project this year -- S-Din, as well as principles of synthetic biology. We received their remarks to our project. From communication with them, we found some previous defect of S-Din, and their views help us think more about the project and improve it.</P><P class="fig-ep">Figure 23.A mini lecture about iGEM projects for students of Guangzhou No. 2 Middle School.</P></DIV><H3>&quot;Synbio Summit&quot; with people from different fields</H3><DIV class="paragraph"><P>What would happen if people from different fields get together to talk about synthetic biology? We decided to have a try -- to hold &quot;Synbio Summit&quot;.</P><P>We invited guests majoring in sociology, computer science, environmental science, law and so on. At the beginnning of the summit, we introduced the basic concepts of synthetic biology, and express our previous thinking about what synbio will affect other fields. Participants were the first time to learn about synthetic biology, but they gave their opinions to us, including phrase, puzzles and worries after they realized what synbio may do with everyone's life. </P><P>For 1.5 hours, we talked about lots of topics around synthetic biology, including safety, societal effects, moral ethics and so on. We realized that we were not only the &quot;teacher&quot; in the field of synthetic biology, but also a humble student, for every field could teach us useful lessons.</P><P>Through communication, you'll know how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work.</P><P class="fig-ep">Figure 24: Participants are discussing in &quot;Synbio Summit&quot;. </P><P class="fig-ep">Figure 25: Synbio Summit. </P></DIV></SECTION><DIV id="contact"><DIV id="contact-content"><DIV class="contact-item"><DIV class="contact-heading">contact</DIV><DIV class="contact-value">sysusoftware@126.com</DIV></DIV><DIV class="contact-item"><DIV class="contact-heading">address</DIV><DIV class="contact-value">135# Xin'gang Rd(W.)Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China</DIV></DIV><DIV class="contact-item"><DIV class="contact-heading">GET IN TOUCH</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
