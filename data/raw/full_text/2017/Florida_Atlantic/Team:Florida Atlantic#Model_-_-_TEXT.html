LSTM Machine Learning Model
The LSTM model contained two lstm layers with 300 nodes each. The first lstm layer used dropout with a dropout probability of 0.5 to avoid overfitting the training data. The third layer of the network was a fully-connected layer with 150 nodes and hyperbolic tangent activation function. The output layer contained two nodes with a softmax activation function.
