Safety
Safety is a number one priority for the OwlGEMS! Most of our work was performed on computers on FAU grounds, eliminating much of the risk involved in microbial research. What little wet lab work we did perform was done in a secure BSL-2 laboratory with proper PPE, and was performed by students that have received Biological Safety and Lab Safety training from FAU. Furthermore, we did not use any dangerous chemicals or biological pathogens in our research, so the risk of contamination was minimal.
