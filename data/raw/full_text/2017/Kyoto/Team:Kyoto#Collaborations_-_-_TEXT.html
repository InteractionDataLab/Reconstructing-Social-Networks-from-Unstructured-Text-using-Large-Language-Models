1) The exchange of presentation slides and videos of 2016's Giant Jamboree
On 13th January 2017, our team and iGEM Hokkaido exchanged slides and video recordings of the presentations at 2016 Giant Jamboree. The information and practices exchanged were utilized for this year’s project as a referencing material. It helped us find where to focus our energy on to better this year’s presentation.
2) iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
Hosted by our team, we invited Japanese iGEM teams to the Kansai Forum on 19th February 2017. In the forum, each team presented their project progress and team management methods, followed by heated discussions on each other’s project and management methods. Advices and thoughts were exchanged, and it inspired teams as they continued their projects. Here is the questionnaire taken during this forum!

3) May Festival
On 20th and 21st May 2017, UT-Tokyo hosted an event for Japanese iGEM teams during the school festival of the University of Tokyo, “May Festival”. Participating teams presented their projects and offered advices on other teams’ projects. It provided us with a chance to reassess our presentation in terms of intelligibility and simplicity.

4) Asia Conference in Taiwan
Asian iGEM teams gathered together in Taiwan and presented their projects and their progress. After that, we exchanged opinions on each other’s projects.

5) The exchange of opinions with Taiwan team
After 5th Asia Pacific iGEM Conference, we have contacted Taiwan teams online, and discussed further our projects.
6) Providing Wiki Creation Assisting Software: KELN to iGEM members
Last year, our team developed KELN, a software for easily making HTML codes for tables in lab notebook pages. It is highly useful when making HTML tables for lab notebooks (experimentation results), and we provided the software for Kobe iGEM team. They sent us feedback on the software, and we found some room for improvement. We are currently revising the software. We sincerely thank Kobe team for the pointers. The feedback was as follows:
-Feedback on KELN-
1. You kindly gave us a manual for KELN, and it helped us understand how to use it. However, we were a little bit confused which version we should install and how to change members’ name, because the manual was not for the latest version but for the original version.
2. We found that KELN was very helpful to write about routine work by using tables. However, we felt that the format is to some extent restricted. For example, we found it a little hard to put comments into a necessary space. It might be better to add some functions so that one can design pages as they want.
3. We tried to change some codes so that it would fit out aims. However, even though we installed Eclipse, we couldn’t even run the original code (probably we should construct some settings, because ‘import’ doesn’t work correctly). Of course, it came from the lack of our knowledge. But, we hope you will add some explanation so that other teams like us can change this tool easily.
