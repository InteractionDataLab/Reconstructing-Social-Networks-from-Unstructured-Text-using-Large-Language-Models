Composite part
In this section, we nominate our Best Composite Part: T7 promoter-RRE ( BBa_K2403002 ). Expression of RNA with an RRE (Rev Response Element), provides a way to achieve nuclear export of any RNA, especially those with complex structure.
Best Composite Part
Construction   We combined our RRE part ( BBa_K2403001 ) along with a T7 promoter ( BBa_K1614000 ) for RNA expression in the high copy BioBrick assembly plasmid pSB1C3.
iGEMers can simply digest our composite part BBa_K2403002 with the restriction enzymes XbaI and SpeI, and ligate their custom sequence which will be expressed as an RNA that includes an RRE. Along with expression of Rev protein, they can easily export their RNA from the nucleus.
This part makes it possible for complex RNA to be transported to the cytoplasm by CRM1. Please see our result for more detailed information.
