Discussion with Forestry Associationand forest survey
This is a very suggestive idea for those who work greatly for society. Instead of conducting research on the laboratory alone, unless it is in accordance with the actual circumstances of the problem, it becomes meaningless even though you use cutting-edge technology. The important thing is to reflect the voices and realities of the site. We tried to make our project suitable for the reality both by visiting the Forestry Association and asked their opinions and by going out to the mountain by ourselves.
“ Regardless to any work, it is only in the field is to be able to learn in practice. ”

Screening of "Genetic Roulette"
Regarding genetic modification, there are still many people who have strong opposition. We can not ignore their opinion when trying to use genetic modification technology in society. So we jumped into opponents of genetic modification on our own initiative. A thrilling dialogue with them has become a completely new experience for us.
“ The opponents have the logic of opponents.
Condemning them as mindless people before hearing it  will not mend matters.
It does not lead to an essential solution of the problem. ”

Events
In proceeding with the project we not only had discussions with professional, but also actively participated in various events, explained our projects, and sought non-professional advice. Their unprejudiced and fresh opinions were very useful for making our point of view sticking to general.
“ The collection of opinions of many people produces good ones. ”
------Hideo Sawada(the founder of H.I.S.-Japanese famous travel agency)
