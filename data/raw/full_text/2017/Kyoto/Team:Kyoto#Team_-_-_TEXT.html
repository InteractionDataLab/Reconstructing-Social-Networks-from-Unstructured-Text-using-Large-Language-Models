I can’t think of doing any more than I’ve already done......

My job : Wikiediter / Experimentation
I like the word "YMW (Yatte Minakereba Wakaranai)." This phrase means we cannnot know it before we try something.
Ren Takimoto

My job : Human practice
I participated in a Giant Jamboree last year and I had a lot of fun talking with a variety of people, so I'm looking forward to meeting and having a talk with people from all over the world again this year. My hobby is to work out and breed living things. I'm excited to meet you!!
Akiko Fukuda
2nd year student of the Department of Science
My job : Experimentation and design creation
As I took photos of the nematodes many times, I came to think they are charming. I designed original pictures of logo mark and wiki figures. I like to draw pictures in my free time and I'm in the art club, too. I'm interested in developmental biology and morphology now.
Yusuke Tanigaki
2nd year student of Sciences for Drag Discovery
My job : Wiki design and creation
Recently I have been attracted to movement of modern economy, organic chemistry, and combination of these fields. In order to combine them, I have to study hard for economic science, think common points or similar point! But it is obvious that this trial is so tough, so I hope those who see my introduction consider this potential.
Tong You
1st year student of Environmental Engineering
My job : Experimentation and wiki creation
It is interesting to know how to our body works, so Biology is very attractive for me. Why does our urine smell so strangely after we eat asparagus? The problem has interested me since I was a child... I also like dancing, traveling and playing musical instruments. I especially like playing shamisen. I want to try various things while young!
Ayaka Sohda
1st year student of the Department of Science
My job : Wiki creation
I am interested in learning and watching the way of life of many kinds of animals, and I am going to major in biology, especially in animal ecology or ethology. My favorite place is zoo, so I want to go to many zoos that I have never been to. I like dancing, and I also belong to Kyoto University girls dance club.
