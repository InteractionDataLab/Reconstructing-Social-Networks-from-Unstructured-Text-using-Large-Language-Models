As our projects are greatly related to society, it was most important to create devices that are actually required in society. Therefore, through the following activities, we tried to make our project more suitable for reality.
●We decided the direction of our device by discussions with the staffs of two forestry associations who are professionals at pine-wilt disease.
To see more details of "Discussion with Forestry Association", please click here.
●We tried experiments with our device using nematodes obtained from the Forest survey.

●We took advantage of the knowledge gained from the forest survey and thought about the new possibilities of our device.
