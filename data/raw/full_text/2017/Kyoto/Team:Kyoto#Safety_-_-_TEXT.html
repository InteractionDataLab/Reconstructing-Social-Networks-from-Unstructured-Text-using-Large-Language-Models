About Safety
1) Safe project design
2) Safe lab work
1) Safe project design
Rev, a protein which we used for nuclear export of mRNA, derives from HIV-1. Although HIV-1 is known for cause of AIDs (Acquired immunedeficiency syndrome), this protein does not cause any diseases.
2) Safe lab work
We did all experiments using the safety and management manual we made by ourselves.
Three of us recieved safety lecture in Kyoto University and shared it.
