The team created our own version of &quot;Flat Stanley&quot;, whom we named &quot;Mike the Microbe.&quot; We sent Mike the Microbe to teams all across the globe in hopes that they would take a picture with Mike in their workspace or team meeting. We were overjoyed to receive many pictures with other teams on social media from across the world. Our goal to share information about our project was achieved, with the other teams really enjoying the opportunity to interact with us over social media about ETEC! We hope to meet these teams at the Jamboree to extend our thanks. Teams who participated: Grongingen, Hamburg,
 KU Leuven, XMU-China, and KU Leuven!</P><P class="caption">Mike the Microbe photos from XMU-China!</P></DIV><DIV class="text2"><H2>Northwestern</H2><P>One of the first teams we reached out to was Northwestern. We exchanged project information and provided each other with initial feedback. This acted as our first step toward collaboration with other teams!</P></DIV><DIV class="text"><H2>Imperial London</H2><P>For our team, the wiki has proved the most challenging aspect of the required iGEM components due to our lack of coding experience. Fortunately for us, London's Imperial Team came to the rescue! The Brits guided us on various wiki components and even offered their old website code for us to dissect and examine in order to implement on our website. We're extremely grateful and hope to meet them in Boston to express our thanks!</P></DIV><DIV class="text2"><H2>City of London School of Boys (CLSB)</H2><P>CLSB was also very beneficial in wiki help. They assisted us with questions we had when coding the wiki and helped us troubleshoot some of our problems. We also helped to edit their <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:CLSB-UK/HP/HS_Guide">iGEM High School Guide</A> by providing suggestions for revision and other feedback.</P></DIV><DIV class="text"><H2>NUS Singapore</H2><P>Wilbert from the Singapore University team was extremely helpful, assisting us with any number of iGEM components and technicalities. He enthusiastically gave us pointers about the Jamboree as well as the iGEM “Do’s and Don’ts”. Because this is our first year participating in the iGEM competition, Wilbert meticulously explained some of the more obscure steps to achieve medal criteria. Most importantly, Wilbert graciously helped us with the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:US_AFRL_CarrollHS/Model">Modeling</A> component of our project involving the substitution of various Ribosomal Binding Sites. We can't wait to meet him in November! </P></DIV><DIV class="text2"><H2>Cadets2Vets/USMA- West Point/USNA Annapolis</H2><P> Our team held a long Skype discussion concerning the iGem process and goals, as well as the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:US_AFRL_CarrollHS/Interlab">Interlab</A>, wiki details, and activities at the Jamboree with the teams from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marines. The US Navy team advised us to complete the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:US_AFRL_CarrollHS/Interlab">Interlab</A> carefully and to use the already provided Excel spreadsheet. On our side, we guided the US Army team with troubleshooting their project. After the video conference, we were able to finish the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:US_AFRL_CarrollHS/Interlab">Interlab</A> swiftly with few hiccups.</P></DIV><DIV class="text"><H2>Michigan State Meet-up</H2><P>We attended the mini-Jamboree/meet-up on July 29th at Michigan State University. It was an awesome experience with several teams from across the Midwest gathering to discuss their projects. Our team gave a short presentation and received both criticism and praise concerning our work. It was fascinating to learn about the research and progress of the other iGEM groups! After the presentations, we talked with members from the other teams about everything iGEM!  We even spoke with an iGEM veteran who gave us extremely insightful advice on the inner workings of the Jamboree.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
