Electrophoresis/Gel Protocols
1% Agarose Electrophoresis Gel
Add 0.35 g agarose to 35 mL 1x TAE in 100mL conical flask
Heat in microwave for 35 seconds
Swirl and heat in microwave for 25 seconds
Swirl and heat in microwave for 15 seconds
Swirl and heat in microwave for 7 seconds
Swirl and ensure no ‘floaties’
Cool outside of conical flask with water until ‘hand not’
Pour into gel mold and add well comb
Gel Extraction
Use ethanol-wiped scalpel to excise appropriate bands
Mix and incubate at 50°C for 10 min
Vortex every 2 mins until gel slice is completely dissolved
Place nucleospin column into 2mL collection tube
Add sample
Centrifuge at 11,000 xg for 1 minute
Discard throughflow and place column back in same tube
Add 700 mL Buffer NT3
Centrifuge at 11,000 xg for 1 minute
Discard throughflow and place column back in same tube
Repeat step 4
Centrifuge at 11,000 xg for another minute
To remove buffer
Discard throughflow
Centrifuge at 11,00 xg for add minute
Place column in a clean, labelled 1.5 mL tube
Add 25 mL prewarmed (50°C) Buffer NE
Incubate at 50°C for 5 min
Centrifuge at 50 xg for 1 minute
Centrifuge at 11,000 xg for 1 minute
Plasmid Transformation Protocol
Aliquot 1 ml media into 1.5 mL tubes
Place in 42°C waterbath
Prechill labelled 14 mL round-bottom falcon tubes
Add mL cell culture to tube
Add appropriate amount of ligase rxh (2-2.5 L)
Incubate in nice for 20 minutes
Heat shock cells by placing at 42℃ for 45 seconds in waterbath
Place on ice for 2 minutes
Add 950 mL preheated media to each tube
Incubate at 37℃ with 215 rpm shaking for 1.5 hr -> 20 minutes
Plating
Plate on LB-antibiotic plates
Plate 100 ml for 1x transformation
Plate 100 mL 9x centrifuge remaining transformation at 2000 xg for 5 minutes and resuspended pellet in 100 L media
Plates Protocol
Follow LB Agar Recipe
Make sure to put stirring bar in water
Needed to make into homogenous gel
Needs to be sterile
Put into Autoclave
Lid should not be too tight
Put in ice bath42°C
Cool till not burning hand
Put on stirring plate
Put sterilized plates in Lamenia shield
Using micropipette put .5 mL of chlor. And amp. agar solution
1000x dilution
Amp. has to be defrosted in dark drawer
Pour solution into plates
Thin layer fill bottom
Take lid slightly off to prevent condensation
