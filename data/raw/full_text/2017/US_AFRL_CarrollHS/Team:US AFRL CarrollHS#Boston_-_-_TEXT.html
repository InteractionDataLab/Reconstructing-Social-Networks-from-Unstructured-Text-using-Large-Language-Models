Our Time in Boston
Being a first-year team, we couldn't wait to gain the full iGEM experience we had heard so much about from our fellow iGEMers. Our first Giant Jamboree was everything we could possibly have imagined and much more! Not wanting to miss a minute, we kept busy watching other team's presentations, attending workshops, and exploring/presenting at the poster sessions. Even with all of these activities, we found time to tour the city. Here's our journey:
