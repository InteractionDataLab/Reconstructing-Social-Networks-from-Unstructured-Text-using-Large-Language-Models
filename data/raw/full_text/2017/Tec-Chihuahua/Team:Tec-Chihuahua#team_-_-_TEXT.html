Team
Our team consists of students from third and fifth semester, we’re all hard-working classmates inside the lab and great friends outside the lab, always united by our universal love for science and technology.
Adalberto
I am a 20 year old student, currently studying on my 5th semester of Law School. Kind of more like Louis than Harvey.
Alejandra
Hey! I´m a 20 years old law student currently studying my 5th semester. This year is my first time on the iGEM world, and I´ll be collaborating with the Human Practices team. I´m looking forward to taking the most out of this experience. I love baking, swimming, spending time with my family and friends. I enjoy art museums and buying flowers. I´m a nature lover and an ice cream enthusiast. One last thing: Never trust anyone who chooses vanilla ice cream having a thousand flavors at their disposal.
Alejandro
Hey! I am a 20-year-old student, right now in my 3rd semester of Biotechnology Engineering. This time is a great opportunity to learn new things and meet a lot of people. I like playing sports, doing lab work and spending time with my family, friends and le babino.
Andrea
Hi there! I’m a 20-year-old student, right now in my 5th semester of Biotechnology Engineering. This year is my second time participating in iGEM; the last year experience was so incredible that I decided to be part of it one more time. I am looking forward to having a lot of fun this year with my new team. Besides science, I’m into music and weightlifting, and my life motto is “Don’t trust anyone who doesn’t like The Beatles.”
Angel David
I’m 20 years old student, and I’m from Cuauhtemoc and a 5th-semester student of biotechnology engineering. I like cheese and my girlfriend, but I prefer cheese, in my free time I'm Batman so I save thousands of lives that’s why I’m studying biotechnology, so I can save more lives with synthetic biology. I was just kidding I prefer my girlfriend especially when she is smiling and giving me cheese.
Armando
Hello! I'm a 20-year-old 5th-semester student of biotechnology engineering. I was born a potato but thanks to synthetic biology I'm now almost a human. A lot of people consider me an intriguing and random person; I consider this a key aspect of my personality. When I have free time some of the things I enjoy doing are reading everything I find interesting, listening to dope music, and burying myself in the ground like the tubercule I once was, you gotta keep true to your roots. I love doing lab work and everything that's involved with it.
Carlos
Hola! I am a 20-year-old student, currently studying in my 5th semester of Law School, I´m very excited to be part of this team in this edition of iGEM although I don´t know much of biotechnology, that´s why I´m going to be helping out on the human practices. I enjoy spending my time with my friends, listening music, shooting some hoops and watching all kinds of sports.
Gabriel
Kuira ba! I come from the Sierra Tarahumara in Chihuahua. Some months ago I had dark skin, but since I got into the school, the doctor in the lab sprayed me with lightening bacteria. No, I am just kidding. I'm 19 years old, and I am in the third semester of the exciting career that I love. I like volleyball, Biotechnology Engineering but my specialty is singing, playing guitar and ukelele, among other things. I enjoy spending time with my family, old and new friends. I am very excited to be a part of this edition of iGEM, and I know it will be amazing!
Joel Orlando
Konnichiwa! I’m currently a 20-year-old student of  Biotechnology Engineering and about to start my 5th semester. It's the second year in a row that’ll be an iGEMER, so I’m looking forward to reliving the experience all over again. I'm going to be helping out on the lab work, the mathematical model, and human practices. If  I had to talk a little about me, I’d say that I  enjoy all types of art (especially music and drawing), making jokes, teasing my mates and laughing out loud. My favorite food is sushi, and although my teammates say the opposite I'm not Japanese.
José Luis
I’m 19 years old, and a 5th-semester student of biotechnology engineering. I feel excited to be involved in this project because it gives me the opportunity to fulfill one of my dreams, of doing something to help people around the world. Some of my hobbies are  dancing, playing soccer, reading, planting trees, and love working with plants, that’s why I would like to focus my career on agricultural aspect.
José Luis
I´m a 19 year old student, currently studying my 3rd semester of Biotechnology Engineering. I have a lot of expectations about my career, so i try to be involved in every project regarding biotechnology. Some of the things I like to do in my free time are reading, going to the gym and seeing beautiful girls. I also like to spend time with my friends, swim and  when i have the opportunity to and I try to travel and know about different places.
José Pablo
I’m 20 years old, currently in my 5th semester as a student of biotechnology engineering. Some of the things I like are: playing basketball, graphic design, science, playing soccer, camping, fishing, exercising and being around the people that I love. This project is significant to me, as it lets me make headway into knowing what is going to be like my professional life, and get a lot of knowledge of synthetic biology.
Karla
I’m a 19th-year-old architecture student, currently collaborating in the design and visual area. This is my first time as an iGEM team member at human practices. I support and try to communicate every method, process, and conclusion required for the project so that the rest of our community can figure out and understand IGEM’S worldwide impact. Food enthusiast, land cape lover, and jazz dancer.
Marcela
I am a 20 year old student, law student, dancer, meliorist, enthusiast, happy.
María Elena
I’m a 5th-semester student of Biotechnology Engineering, I’m 19 years old, and since I was a child, I was amazed by all the stuff involved with labs, so I’m glad I got involved in this project with such an amazing team. I’m so thankful for my family, they are everything to me.
Vivian
I’m a 20-year-old student, currently studying my 5th semester of Industrial Engineering, is the first time I am part of the team of iGem and the mathematical model. I love playing sports and hanging out with my friends and family.
