Overview
As shown above, our project meets all the requirements from a social and political point of view as an ideal practice for Human practices (link). On the other hand, from an economic perspective by working in the area of entrepreneurship. This, in order to give a solution to the various problems affecting fruit growers when facing the disease known as fire blight. Achieving this by the formulation of a biocontrol product that is effective, affordable, and can be used by anyone in the world. That is the reason why we have emphasized on a functional prototype (minimum viable product, MVP), which was developed from the value propositions obtained after a thorough market study. Taking advantage of all of those situations where the customer is not satisfied using other products available in the market. Along with the comprehensive business plan presented down below, we have an operating technology, as well as a viable and innovative business model. Both will help us determine the viability of our project in a competitive industrial environment. For all of this, it was necessary to obtain a social, technical and economic validation before starting. Technical and economic validation was achieved based on a series of documents for the entrepreneurship area and interviews with different experts in so, but also with potential customers with a great impact on the Latin American apple market.
We are aware that founding a new company involves many challenges and leads to uncertainty and fear. However, we know that just a few teams from the past editions of iGEM have been set up as startups, although there are many projects with very innovative ideas, not only from a scientific point of view but also from the commercial point of view. Therefore, we work arduously to get a deeper understanding of what led us as a team to carry out our work in entrepreneurship.
Thanks to the most important entrepreneurship program in Mexico, presented by Parque Tecnológico Nova Orión and the Tecnológico de Monterrey Business Incubator, a methodology was developed that would ensure any startup to grow its idea in the best possible way ( link). Going beyond than just sharing our results, we obtained different tips for all iGEM teams that will complement each team´s project.
