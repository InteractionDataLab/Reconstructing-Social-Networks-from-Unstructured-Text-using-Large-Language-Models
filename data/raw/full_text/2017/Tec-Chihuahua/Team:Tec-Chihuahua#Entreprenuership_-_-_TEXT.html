Overview
1. Executive Summary
Synthetic biology can be used to advance many stages of the world today, from agriculture and biomanufacturing, groundbreaking cancer treatments and medicines, to even fashion and information technology. As science continues to evolve, scientists, engineers, and designers themselves need to focus our efforts on creating local biological solutions to meet global needs. But what we can’t forget is to take a step back and look at the world as a whole. How does what we develop ultimately affect the world, from insects and plants to animals and aquatic life? While the full potential of synthetic biology continues to develop, we as a community must join together to make sure we don’t lose focus on the global impacts of our collective capacities. How can we best help not only humans but also the rest of the planet? Erwinoons is a startup business that aims to combat the damage caused by the bacteria Erwinia amylovora, which causes losses of millions of dollars on a yearly bases. Therefore we are developing a biocontrol that doesn’t affect the microbiota where it is introduced, preserving the ecosystem, while getting what we want. Biocontrols are an efficient and cuttiing-edge solution which can achieve great success, as it can ease the plague control. Our team is formed by undergraduates majoring in Biotechnology, and our product consists of a genetically modified strain of Erwinia Amylovora. This bacterium has three exogenous genes (aiiA, yhjH and epsE), these eradicate the four main virulence factors (formation of exopolysaccharides, motility, formation of biofilm and the secretion system type 3), these genes will no longer have the capability to infect the tree, but will prosper in the tree; occupying the territory that could occupy the wild Erwinia Amylovora. Therefore, it will serve as a biological control by competition for apple trees against fire blight.
This product aims to replace the common treatments that are used to quell the damage caused by this disease: antibiotics and chemicals. Also, it will reduce costs on losses and operation for treated and infected trees. Subsequently, the environmental impact will also be reduced throughout the production area. The economic sector of fruit growing, and more specifically of apple production, is of interest in Mexico and internationally; in 2011 Mexico broke its previous record of 630,500 metric tons, a level that represents a growth of 4% in relation to the previous year. Our market research shows us the following key points:
The use of chemicals and antibiotics in the treatment of fire blight is somewhat effective, but it decreases with continuous use which itself makes it more expensive. Big producers, such as La Norteñita, are looking for an innovative and effective solution for this disease.
Due to the excessive use of antibiotics, bacteria are becoming rapidly resistant to them.
A significant profit, represented in great savings and greater yield, can be generated through the use of biocontrol; leaving on the side the bioaccumulation in the crops caused by the excessive use of chemical elements and antibiotics.
Therefore, Erwinions was created with the following goals:
Reduce the ecological footprint left by chemicals and antibiotics, as well as combating bacteria without affecting the native microbiota.
Stop the spread of antibiotic resistances in bacteria
Cut down on costs of long-term.
Put forth the knowledge of biocontrols as an eco-friendly solution, for bacterial disease
Erwinions is the only company that aims to use genetically modified E. amylovora to be used as a biological control against the fire blight disease in Rosaceae crops. This product will be patented, and we will continue enhancing our product through feedback, according to the farmer thus; giving personalized attention which is a mark of difference from our brand. This report will show the outline of our Business Plan, and how we plan to develop our product as well as how to incorporate it into the market.

Product Concept & customer ( MVP y Descripción de arquetipo)
Global food industry and security today are vulnerable due to massive growth of human population, climate changing will place huge demands on natural resources, the emergence of new virulent pathogens that had antibiotic or pesticide resistance, and demands from increasingly discerning consumers for chemical-free, sustainably produced food products that ensures a yield improvement on less cultivable land space. Bacterium based biological control agents are used as part of an integrated management system, which promotes sustainable agriculture. Based on the method of using the power of natural biology to reach a desired result in the field there is an effective solution to bridge societal, growth needs and allow farmers to be productive and environmentally conscious.
Currently, there is an extensive range of products used as biological controls that offer alternatives to different problems that afflict farmers, especially fruit growers from Mexico, the United States and the rest of the world. However, all of these alternatives that are currently in the international market share the same disadvantages; having a very low-efficiency level and prices out of reach, making the investment not profitable, speaking of millions of dollars in the case to control the incidence of the fire blight on apple trees.
These are some reasons why our value levers are not only focused on providing a solution with high efficiency to control this disease but also offers a greater survival of biological control into the plant of interest at a lower price in which it is normally found for sale.
Descripción detallada del cliente potencial (PENDING)
Product.- Our product is a biocontrol that combats the fire blight which is caused by E. amylovora, comprised of a genetically modified strain of Erwinia amylovora which has all of its virulence factors inhibited (formation of exopolysaccharides, motility, formation of biofilm and the secretion system type 3), which, were inhibited with three enzymes (aiiA, yhjH and epsE), these were introduced to the bacteria by chromosomal insertion using the CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA complex.
Being of the same species means that it is going compete for the same resources and available space with the phytopathogenic bacteria. The biocontrol can be applied directly to the foliage thanks to the method of sodium alginate microencapsulation, same that maintains the bacteria metabolically dormant which extends the active effect. Preventive application is essential for optimal use, as the bacteria needs to be there to control a exogenous E. amylovora, as it prevents it to form high enough cellular density to change to a sessile state and infect the plant. This product is foreseen to have an admirable market launch as it has many value levers which greatly increases our chances of success.
Marketing competition (Benchmarking)
Market:
Our product is planned to target the market of biological products, specifically in the biological control industry. A market analysis of the Dunham Trimmer International Bio Intelligence showed a global biological control market in 2017 of $2.8 Bn of dollars and forecasted a growth to $11 Bn of dollars by 2025. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was calculated to grow 16% between 2015-2025. Our product can be considered into the biocontrol agents in agriculture, the most important market of the biocontrol agents that is reported to be about 1680 million in 2015. The market of biological control products can be segmented in different ways by type, target pest, crop application a geography. Focusing about type segmentation, our product is part of the biopesticides, specifically in the microbial-bacteria part. This segment is the one with most demand in the world, biocontrol of microbials market is growing faster as both small and large companies, and it is expected to growth nearly 60% of market through 2025, approximately 6.6 Bn of dollars.
Our product is classified in different ways depending in the segmentation of the biological control market, for example, in geography we are in the latin american region, according to the Dunham Trimmer analysis, the Latin American region is experiencing the fastest growth in the biological control market, in spite of this, nowadays the strongest region in the biocontrol market is North America, having in 2016, 38% of the global share. Finally the crop application in our product will be in the section of vegetable and fruits and our target is a micro-organism.
The growth of this market is attributed to high cost of agrochemicals and their negative impact on food quality and environment compared with biological control products that are considered as ecologically sustainable and safe crop protection solutions.
Microbials growing faster as both small and large companies invest in microbial discovery and development. Investors see a great opportunity to invest in biocontrol companies because of the rapidly growth of this market. Investing in this market could be a great opportunity to increase the industrial production as it is one of the most reliable markets nowadays.
Marketing competitors
Although no significant events are projected to impact market growth, development of new technologies, especially in the area of microbial products could stimulate market growth.
These new technologies are being implemented in order to get better and more efficient biocontrol products, this means that the market is going to evolve quickly. Our product not only aims to fulfill all the gaps that those products from our competitors can't achieve but also to improve those results from the ones that are commonly used nowadays. Since our product is a biocontrol, it can be fitted into the bactericide market, a market that has strong and experienced competitors that keep improving their products in order to keep the sales high. The impact of regulatory changes in the EU, USA or other lead countries could be an upside factor to promote the market growth.
We analyzed our direct competitors based on the characteristics of the products they offer, with special attention in the unmet customer needs. Our product has the objective to fulfil this needs, having the most advantages as possible as compared to the competence.
The first product analyzed was the bordeaux mixture, a mixture of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO4) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) used as a fungicide and bactericide. The environmental impact lasts longer than other similar products. In terms of phytotoxicity, the bordeaux mixture leaves a salty deposit, has a high pH and it is more phytotoxic than other products, the phytotoxicity increases in cold and wet environments. It is important to mention that this mixture is not compatible with most pesticides which makes its preparation difficult because of the longer time it takes to prepare and also requires more knowledge and safety equipment.
Agri-Mycin is a protectant bactericide designed to combat difficult diseases such as fire blight in apples, pears, tomatoes, peppers, celery and tobacco. The main disadvantage of this product is that it needs to get mixed with other chemicals, rising in a considerable way the investment of the agricultor.
Blossom Protect is a biocontrol product used for the prevention of fire blight. Beneficial microorganisms outcompete the fire blight pathogen for space and nutrients, blocking the site of fire blight infection. This product could be considered one of our main competitors, but the product has an exclusive sale only in the United States.
CUPRIMICÍN 500 HYPER is a fungicide, bactericide and mycoplasmicide of the group of the preventive in mixture with antibiotics, that acts as a control of diseases caused by fungi, bacteria and mycoplasmas. This product has a great distribution in Mexico, but has some disadvantages as a high level of toxicity to fishes and bees, therefore the effects have a short duration lacking long-term effectiveness.
SERENADE® MAX is a biological fungicide, a natural product based on Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713, formulated as a wettable powder, for the control of diseases caused by fungi or bacteria in crops. This fungicide works better as a preventive use, it can be used in presence of the disease but only if combined with antibiotics or other chemicals. Do not apply SERENADE® MAX when raining, against wind or during periods of strong wind. It is phytotoxic in some crops and should not be mixed with other fungicides.
Some of these products work better than others but lack on something else, the main objective of our product is to become the best biocontrol product in the market, fulfilling all the needs and being environmentally friendly with a long-term effectiveness that many agricultors want.

Business model (CANVAS) (done-Gabo (sólo faltan algunos datos concretos))
Synthetic biology has recently been at the center of the world’s attention as a new scientific and engineering discipline that allows the design of biological systems or devices, as well as improving cellular components that already exist in nature.
Through widespread interviews, we have sought to validate our business hypothesis with the purpose of generating evidence of the needs, pains, and gains of our customers as well as the proposals they can come up with, these last ones commonly called value propositions.
Once we finished the stage of interviews, we have been able to identify all the key pain points of our customers, not only their hassles and worries but also their mechanisms of action against this pathogen.
Throughout this process, our initial hypothesis has been constantly changing until we reached a point where we obtained coherent parameters. In this point, an important tool was implemented to generate this data, CANVAS.
Based on the business model canvas, we split our business model into seven parts:
Key Activities.
We developed a genetically modified organism; the first Erwinia Amylovora bacterium with its virulence factors inhibited. There is scientific research that support the bases of our work. Our hypothesis about the market potential of our product was confirmed during the interview we had with some of the most important apple producers in Mexico. In addition to the validation of our product, we received feedback from several important institutions in Cuauhtemoc city: La Norteñita (the largest apple producer in Latin America), SAGARPA, Cuauhtemoc Apple Distributor Association, Government of the state of Chihuahua and Inifap.
Customer Segment.
Cuauhtémoc is the most important area of apple production in Latin America. According to our field research; surveys and interviews; fire blight disease occurs in most apple orchards, and this causes serious losses in production. Thus, farmers are concerned about the spread of the blight on their crops.
The disease has a low-moderate incidence, reason why the farmers have the interest to acquire a solution that can be efficient and cheap, and reduce enormously the presence of this pathogen in its orchard.
Key Resources.
Genetically modified organisms, in this cases developed to provide a better cost-benefit ratio when combating an unwanted disease, compared to traditional methods. Mainly because our product’s application and effective time are longer lasting. In addition, we use a cheaper microencapsulation system than biocontrols mostly use.
Value Proposition.
In Rosaceae plant orchards (apple, pear, peach, peach), we propose the introduction of a biocontrol that has a mechanism of molecular action, and helps to counteract the incidence of fire blight in these fruits; and in doing so, it subsequently increases the production of that fruit, and therefore, maximizes the profits for the fruit growers and decreases the cost in losses.
Customer Relationship and Channels.
In order to make our product known and to establish good relations with our customers, we will offer initial samples for free, as well as personalized attention to each client; solving their doubts with advice of agronomists and experienced people in the business. In addition, it is intended to maintain a continuous inspection of the disease in the garden of each client. The dialogue will always be open between our company and the farmer; from there we will get feedback that we will use to improve our product.
Purchase of our product can be based on an online store or through authorized dealers. Direct contact would also be by farmers that are satisfied with our work, which recommend the use of our product in their acquaintances.
Cost Structure.
Our major cost drivers are the rent of the laboratory and laboratory costs. An additional high investment, would be CRISPR. Our current calculation resulted in a cost of about $XXXXX USD per per bottle of microencapsulated bacteria. We calculated that Thus, we are able to produce about XXXXX per year, which perfectly fits the calculated needs of the strategic partner we plan to exclusively supply during the first year. A detailed calculation of the costs and revenue streams can be found in the appendix (Appendix Armandiuxxxxxxxiii).
Revenue.
The client pays an amount to invest in a seasonal prevention for the disease, in order to obtain a better harvest; fruits of better quality and improved production. No matter the price, the customer will always benefit as a cost-benefit by our product, because the losses today the customers suffer are very expensive.
or
Our revenue stream is our customers purchasing the product of our microencapsulated bacteria. To calculate the amount of our product that we can sell to them in one year, we expect that usually XXXXXXXXXXXX. Since usually around XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX From interviews, we gained the impression that we can demand about $XXXX USD for one bottle. Therefore, we calculate with a turnover of $XXXXX USD. Altogether, we expect a satisfactory gross profit margin of XX%.
