ABSTRACT
This edition, the Tec-Chihuahua team developed a mathematical model focused only in one out of the three enzymes that we study in our project; aiiA. Using a set of differential equations, we managed to simulate a biological system inside Erwinia amylovora where the aiiA enzyme interacts with the quorum sensing phenomenon. The model only includes the performance of this enzyme because of its capacity to inhibit at least two or more of the four virulence factors of E. amylovora. The mathematical system states a basic model capable of simulating and monitoring the general behavior and interaction of an unregulated gene (inhibitor) over a regulated one (inhibited).
Later below and in the following pages, we will describe the behavior of a wild E. amylovora and a modified one, where employing mathematical modeling we were able to predict the impact of our modification inside our target pathogen.
HYPOTHESIS
What are we modeling? As mentioned above, the model is focused on the aiiA enzyme performance. The model expected to visualize and demonstrate the hydrolyzation of acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) molecules and consequently the reduction of the expression of quorum sensing virulence genes.   The aiiA circuit expression was introduced into Erwinia amylovora, so it could be found constitutively and continuously in the cell (green oval). As it travels through the cell, it will discover AHL molecules (purple triangles) and hydrolyze them to deactivate them (yellow hexagons). When disabled, these molecules won’t be recognized by the EamR protein (blue circle) and hence won’t be able to continue to autoactivate its own synthase (purple rhombus) either. As a final result, the quorum sensing genes will no longer be able to potentialize the bacteria’s virulence.
Both EamI and aiiA gene expressions are detailed in the Wild Cell and Modified Cell tabs, respectively. But for better understanding of the interaction between them, mathematical simulations are presented in the Results tab.
