SAFETY
Safety
Preceding any lab work, our team completed an extensive module where we acquire the knowledge to work on a Physical Containment Level 2 laboratory. Safety must be of great importance while working in the laboratory, thatâ€™s why we made sure to be informed about safety in the laboratory before starting to work with the experimental protocols and manipulate the microorganisms that were going to be used throughout our project because we knew that this involved certain risks if managed incorrectly.
Personal Protective Equipment
In the lab we use lab coats, masks, and nitrile gloves in order to prevent contact with aerosols, droplets, and splashes that might be generated during the experiments.
Personal belongings are kept separate from where the potentially infectious materials are being handled.
PPE is removed when leaving the lab.
We have always disinfected our hands with 70% ethanol before and after putting the nitrile gloves on as well as wash our hands when we enter the lab.
Biological Safety Cabinets
In the lab we use biological safety cabinets in order to prevent us to get in contact with the samples that are being analyzed as well as protecting them from getting contaminated. Every time we make use of the biological safety cabinets, we first sterilize it by leaving the UV light on for 15 minutes with the material that's going to be used in the protocols, we also disinfect our hands with 70% ethanol before getting them into the cabinet, and clean it every time we finish using it.
Open Bench: Using Burners to create a sterile zone
When working in open bench, we first have to sterilize the area with 70% ethanol and use of burners to create a sterile zone especially while managing microorganisms.
Wet Lab: Decontamination and Waste Management
Waste must be managed in different ways depending on what is going to be disposed of. Sharp objects must be disposed of in a red thick plastic bottle, biological wastes such as fluids must be disposed of in a yellow hermetic bottle, solid biological wastes in a yellow bag, and objects that have been in contact with bacteria or other infectious agents should be disposed of in a red bag.
We worked on a Containment Level 2 Laboratory, with lockable doors and previous training to handle materials, equipment and biosafety. Benches are covered in varnish (non-absorbent material). The access to the laboratory is restricted to Biotechnology alumni and our Faculty teachers.
Erwinia amylovora
According to our research, E. amylovora only pathogenic to plants but not humans. Nevertheless, as it is an important phytopathogen, we have developed some containment methods to ensure the avoidance of accidental release.   People must wash their hands after having worked with potentially dangerous materials and after getting out from the lab. It is not permissible to eat, drink, smoke, use contact lenses, use makeup or stock food destinated to human consumption into the lab areas. Food must be stored outside the laboratory areas; in cupboards or refrigerators designated for this purpose.  Do all the procedures carefully in order to dismiss the possibility of splashes. In case of splashes, clean the area for 15 minutes with chlorine at 10%. Decontaminate every surface after had finished the lab work, or after any spill of any potentially infectious material, and do it with the appropriate disinfectant.  Decontaminate every crop, utensil or any potentially infectious materials prior to disposal these using an effective method.  Chairs used in the wet lab must be covered with a non-porous material that could be easily cleaned and decontaminated with the appropriate disinfectant.  Use protector lenses when be doing protocols that have the potential to provoke splashes of microorganisms or other dangerous materials. Laboratory equipment must be decontaminated routinely, as well as after spills, splashes or other potential contamination.  Animals and plants not associated with lab work must not be allowed in the laboratory.    Finally and more importantly, we have established the use of a single biosafety cabinet at a unique laboratory designated for the manipulation of Erwinia amylovora. This cabinet is an ESCO Class II BSC, which it is programmed to irradiate UV light during 30 min. This programme is used as soon as the equipment is cleaned with ethanol 70% (v/v)before and after the use of the bacteria for sterilization and decontamination.
