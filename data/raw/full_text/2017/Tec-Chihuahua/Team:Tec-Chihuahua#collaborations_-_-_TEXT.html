Collaborations
Meetup
The "Mexican Teams Meetup" had several activities. Amongst them were a collaboration in Human Practices, which laid the foundations for the Laboratory Handbook, a guide that aims to introduce children from elementary school to science; and a presentation of the progress that we had until that point regarding our project, which aside from giving us an idea of how it will be to present in english, it also made us see our areas of opportunity, which consequently allowed us to improve and be able to be more competitive in the Giant Jamboree. Although these were the technical aspects of the meeting, it was thanks to this meetup that we were able to establish relationships with the members of the various teams that participated; this has not only helped us with things related to the project but has also made the iGEM community of Mexico closer and stronger than ever.
IONIS PARIS
The IONIS Paris team contacted us for a team collaboration. We worked together for several months, mainly focussing in Human Practices and Modeling. The IONIS modeling team helped us to visualize one of our enzymes: “yhjH”, based on bibliography and the enzyme optimal conditions, they managed to simulate it in silico, helping us to establish and assume model parameters and enzyme behaviors, among other things. Besides it, our teams managed to collaborate in Human Practices. Based on the IONIS human practices project, some of our team members contacted winegrowers and oenologists to interview them about how climate change has affected their vineyards. The information gathered was used for a comparative framework between French and Mexican wine production actual adversities. During the meetings with the experts, we also discussed the IONIS team proposal, so they could let them know their points of view and their opinions about it. Therefore, the IONIS team got an international perspective of their project impact.
"We want to thank the team Tec-Chihuahua for their help and support for our human practice project, they help us to understand how farmers in Mexico deal with climate change and how we could use Softershock to solve the problem. They gave us information about synthetic biology in their country to put it on the interactive map in order to share their experiences with their country Mexico and the rest of the world." -Team IONIS Paris

Greece
Team Greece worked on their big Human Practices campaign with a survey. They wanted to know the opinions of the PIs and Instructors of other teams around the world about their project and its social, public and health impact. They included a brief summary of their project to fill us in and after that we send the survey to our team PIs and Instructors. They were happy to help because they are not often this involved in collaborations.
UNL
The University of Nebraska-Lincoln team and Tec-Chihuahua team collaboration goes back to the beginning of the summer. We first presented our projects to each other to get to know us a little better. Later on, the UNL team asked us to share their General Public Survey to get to know Mexicans opinions. At the end, we ended up video calling to officially meet each other and got a great feedback on our projects.
