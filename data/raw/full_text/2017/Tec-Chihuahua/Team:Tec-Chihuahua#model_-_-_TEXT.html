ABSTRACT
This edition, the Tec-Chihuahua team developed a mathematical model that is focused only in one out of the three enzymes that we study in our project, the aiiA. Using a set of differential equations we managed to simulate a biological system inside Erwinia amylovora where the aiiA enzyme interacts with the quorum sensing phenomenon. The model only includes the performance of this enzyme because of its capacity to inhibit at least two or more of the four virulence factors of E. amylovora. The mathematical system states a basic model capable of simulating and monitoring the general behavior and interaction of an unregulated gene (inhibitor) over a regulated one (inhibited).
Later below and in the following pages, we will describe the behavior of a wild E. amylovora and a modified one, where by means of mathematical modeling we were able to predict the impact of our modification inside our target pathogen.
MODELING GENE EXPRESSION
Before starting to model our own biological system, the first step was getting to know the basic mathematical representation of gene expression. As our project is working with an unregulated gene and a regulated one  (autoactivation), they are both described down below to later understand our final model.
LOREM IPSUM DOLOR
As discussed in the Project Description some of Erwinia amylovora´s virulence factors depend on the quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon, and in this specific case the type of AHL used by this phytopathogen is the 3-oxo-C6-HSL, but for simplicity they will continue to be named as AHLs along the whole model.
Despite of the fact that E. amylovora is not a very well studied bacteria and therefore its QS either, we were able to simulate its behavior comparing it to the Vibrio fischeri´s one. The main reason is because of its similarities in the gene regulation where V. fischeri works with the LuxR/LuxI regulation while E. amylovora was found to work under a similar system with a highly homologous regulation, EamR/EamI.
