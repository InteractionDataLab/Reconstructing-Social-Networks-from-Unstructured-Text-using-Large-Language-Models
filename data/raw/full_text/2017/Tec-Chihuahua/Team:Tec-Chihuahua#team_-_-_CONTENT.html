I'm a 20-year-old 5th-semester student of biotechnology engineering. I was born a potato but thanks to synthetic biology I'm now almost a human. A lot of people consider me an intriguing and random person; I consider this a key aspect of my personality. When I have free time some of the things I enjoy doing are reading everything I find interesting, listening to dope music, and burying myself in the ground like the tubercule I once was, you gotta keep true to your roots. I love doing lab work and everything that's involved with it.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H3>Carlos</H3><P align="justify">Hola!

I like volleyball, Biotechnology Engineering but my specialty is singing, playing guitar and ukelele, among other things. I enjoy spending time with my family, old and new friends.

I'm going to be helping out on the lab work, the mathematical model, and human practices. If  I had to talk a little about me, I’d say that I  enjoy all types of art (especially music and drawing), making jokes, teasing my mates and laughing out loud.
