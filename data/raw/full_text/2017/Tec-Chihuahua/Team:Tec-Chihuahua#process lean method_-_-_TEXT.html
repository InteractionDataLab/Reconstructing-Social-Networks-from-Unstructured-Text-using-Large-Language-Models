LEAN METHOD
The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster. This process teaches you how to drive a startup-how to steer, when to turn, and when to persevere-and grow a business with maximum acceleration. It is a principled approach to new product development (Ries, n.d).
According to bibliography found on the internet and other tools such as Google trends, we noticed the relevance of fire blight and its huge impact not only in Mexico but all the apple producing countries. Our initial hypothesis consisted of developing a product that our customer segment would be interested in acquiring in order to solve its fire blight issues. At the beginning, we expected a huge impact only on small and middle producers, a fact that drastically changed along the process of the lean method.

Aspects to evaluate
Sizing the # of people in this segment
How much of the product would be needed?
How easy is the access to the product?
How interested are you in working with this segment of market for the next 5 years?
Based on your research, how much is this segment investing in solving the problem?
Segment

Pains
Gains
Unprofitable investment in disease prevention.
"Reliable" agrochemical alternatives.
Non-lasting periods in the decrease of the infection.
Availability to test new products, as long as they are effective.
Harmful effects to human health and the ecosystem,
such as the development of resistance to antibiotics
Inefficiency of current products
High investments required for the prevention and cure of the fire blight
