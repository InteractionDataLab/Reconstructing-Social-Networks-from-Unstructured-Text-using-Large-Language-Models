Meet the team
Our team consists of students from third and fifth semester, we’re all hard-working classmates inside the lab and great friends outside the lab, always united by our common love for science and technology.
Alejandro
Hey! I am a 19 year old student, right now on my 3rd semester of Biotechnology Engineering. This is a great opportunity to learn new things and meet a lot of people. I like playing sports, doing labwork and spending time with my family, friends and le babino.
Andrea
Hi there! I’m a 19 years old student, right now on my 5th semester of Biotechnology Engineering. This is my second time participating in iGEM, the last year experience was so incredible that I decided to be part of it one more time. I am looking forward to have a lot of fun this year with my new team. Besides science I’m into music and weightlifting, and my life motto is “Don’t trust anyone who doesn’t like The Beatles.”
Angel David
I’m 20 years old student, and I’m from Cuauhtemoc and a 5th semester student of biotechnology engineering. I like cheese and my girlfriend but i prefer cheese, in my free time i’m batman so i save thousands of lives that’s why I’m studying biotechnology so i can save more lives with synthetic biology. I was just kidding I prefer my girlfriend specially when she is smiling and giving me cheese.
Armando
Hello! I'm a 20 year old 5th semester student of biotechnology engineering. I was born a potato but thanks to synthetic biology I'm now almost a human. A lot of people consider me an intriguing and random person, I consider this a key aspect of my personality. When I have free time some of the things I enjoy doing are reading everything I find interesting, listening to dope music, and burying myself in the ground like the tubercule I once was, you gotta keep true to your roots. I love doing labwork and everything that's involved with it.
Gabriel
I come from the Sierra Tarahumara in Chihuahua, everybody call me light feet. Some months ago I was dark skin, but since I get  into the school, the doctor in the lab sprayed me with lightening bacteria. I'm 19 years old and I love my intresting carrier: Biotechnology Engineering. I like volleyball, but my specialty is singing and playing guitar, between others things. I really enjoy spending time with my family, old and new friends. I am very excited to be a part of this edition of iGem, and I know it will be amazing!

Konnichiwa! I’m currently a 20 year old student of  Biotechnology Engineering  and about to start my 5th semester. It's the second year in a row that’ll be an iGEMER, so I’m looking forward to relive the experience all over again. I'm going to be helping out on the labwork, the mathematical model, and human practices. If  I had to talk a little about me, I’d say that I  really enjoy all types of art (especially music and drawing), making jokes and teasing my mates and laughing out loud. My favorite food is sushi and although my teammates say the opposite I'm not Japanese.
Jose Luis
I’m 19 years old, and a 5th semester student of biotechnology engineering. I feel really excited to be involved on this project because it gives me the opportunity to fulfill one of my dreams, of doing something to help people around the world. Some of my hobbies are  dancing, playing soccer, reading, planting trees, and love working with plants, that’s why I would like to focus my career on agricultural aspect and on loving d-nice forever with all my heart.

I am a 19 year old student, currently studying on my 3rd semester of Biotechnology Engineering. I have a lot of expectations about my career, so i tried to be involved in every project about biotechnology. Some of the things I like to do in my free time is to read, go to the gym and see beauty girls, to spend time with my friends, to swim and  when i have the opportunity i try to travel and know about different places.
Jose Pablo
I’m 20 years old, currently on my 5th semester as a student of engineer in biotechnology. Some of the things I like are: playing basketball, graphic design, science, playing soccer, camping, fishing, exercising and being around the people that I love. This project is very important to me, as it lets me make headway in to knowing what is going to be like my professional live, and get a lot of knowledge of synthetic biology.
Maria Elena
I’m a 5th semester student of Biotechnology Engineering, I’m 19 years old and since I was a child, I was amazed by all the stuff involved with labs, so I’m glad I got involved in this project with such an amazing team. I’m so thankful with my family whom is everything to me, and I would like to sa….
