General Introduction
As described on the Design section, we developed a laboratory methodology to accomplish our proof of concept. Fortunately, thanks to different factors, this methodology helped us accomplish all of the bronze, silver, and gold requirements. For example, there were some parts that were already indexed in the iGEM Parts Registry, but lacked characterization. Some others were reported as putative genes on NCBI, which gave us enough reasons to create new parts, meeting the silver criteria. Finally, thanks to our Integrated Human Practices and Entrepreneurship , we were able to establish a demonstration protocol that meets the necessities of a client or posible investor, like "La Norte√±ita" (leading company in apple production and commercialization).
The characterizations that were carried out were both at a molecular and cellular level. For example, we did a protein expression kinetic (bronze and silver), an adherence capacity test (improve), and an apple tree leaves inoculation protocol (demonstrate).
