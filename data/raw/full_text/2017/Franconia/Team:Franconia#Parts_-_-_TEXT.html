BBa_K2419000
SpyTag-ELP5-SnoopCatcher for elastomeric tissue
This part can be used to form an elastomeric tissue. The elastin like protein ELP5 as the main part has a SpyTag and a SnoopCatcher at its end to be able to bind its counterpart "SnoopTag-ELP5-SpyCatcher". Those two kind of proteins can build long polymer chains which can form an elastomeric tissue i.e. for the application as the basic tissue of artificial muscles.
BBa_K2419002
W51W54 for conductive pili production
This part can be used to express conductive pili of Geobacter Sulfurreducens in E.coli bacteria. Since the cultivation of Geobacter Sulfurreducens is difficult due to its strictly anaerobic demand, the expression of the pili in E.coli is the more convenient. The pili can then be used i.e. as the conductive layers of a dielectrical elastomeric actuator for the application of an artificial muscle.
BBa_K2419001
SpyTag-Streptavidin-ELP5-SnoopCatcher for elastomeric tissue connection with molecular machines
This part can be used to form an elastomeric tissue. The elastin like protein ELP5 as the main part has a SpyTag and a SnoopCatcher at its end to be able to bind its counterpart "SnoopTag-ELP5-SpyCatcher". Those two kind of proteins can build long polymer chains which can form an elastomeric tissue i.e. for the application as the basic tissue of artificial muscles. Additionally, the part contains a streptavidin tag for binding to i.e. biotin anchored molecular machines. This cross-linking enables the proteins to form an artificial muscle that can contract and relax in its structure by light stimuli through the mole     cular machines.

TagCFP for analysis of elastomeric tissue
TagCFP is a monomeric protein emitting bright cyan light. It is based on the natural fluorescence of the jellyfish Aequorea macrodactyla, which expresses a GFP-like fluorescent protein. This part can be used to analyze the quality i.e. of an elastomeric tissue out of proteins connected via Catcher-Tag systems (see BBa_K2419000). While such a tissue is formed, TagCFP as a fluorescent protein can be added due to its strong fluorescent emission. As a result, the maxima of emission and absorption of the fluorescent protein shift to a higher level when excited by the specific absorption light wavelength. This shift can only be ascribed to the assembly of TagCFP to the tissue. The behavior of the emission and absorption can therefore be used as a screen of the tissue around the fluorescent protein. The tissue network can be characterized regarding its structure and density. These parameters will give information about the quality of the polymeric network.
Testing the indicational function of TagCFP in an elastomeric tissue
To test the indicational function of TagCFP we created a hydrogel resembling the elastomeric tissue. We then added TagCFP both into water and the hydrogel. The results of this test are shown in Figure 1. On the right, TagCFP fluoresces in a cyan color when added to water and excited with light. Whereas the fluorescence color changes to a light blue when excited with light while being located in the hydrogel.
Figure 1: TagCFP in water (right) and TagCFP in hydrogel (left).
These results visibly show the effect of TagCFP being added to different solutions. The change of the color from cyan in water to light blue in the hydrogel indicates a shift of the emission maximum and therefore TagCFP can be used as a qualitatively test for elastomeric tissue, while additionally, further characterization of the tissue can be achieved.   Characterization    We further characterized the TagCFP to supply a broader understanding of the properties of this fluorescent protein. We therefore measured the absorption and emission of TagCFP. The regarding graph is given below (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Fluorescence spectrum of TagCFP showing absorption and emission at variant wavelengths.
The results show a difference in the wavelength of the absorption and the emission. The absorption of TagCFP has its maximum at a wavelength of 457.4 nm and the emission maximum lays at a wavelength of 478.1 nm. The overlap of absorption and emission can be seen in the area around 470 nm.
We further plotted the measured values of the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength of TagCFP to obtain a height profile given in the diagram below (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Excitation wavelength and emission wavelength of TagCFP.
The diagram displays the distribution of the different wavelengths. The red colored area reveals the overlap of excitation and emission at its uppermost distinctness.
Further characterization of EGFP
We further characterized the “EGFP Protein Production Construct” (Part:BBa_K1123005) of the group iGEM13_TU-Eindhoven to supply a broader understanding of the properties of this fluorescent protein. We therefore measured the absorption and emission of EGFP. The regarding graph is given below (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Fluorescence spectrum of EGFP showing absorption and emission at variant wavelengths.
The results show a difference in the wavelength of the absorption and the emission. The absorption of EGFP has its maximum at a wavelength of 487.5 nm and the emission maximum lays at a wavelength of 508.3 nm. The overlap of absorption and emission can be seen in the area around 500 nm.
We further plotted the measured values of the excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength of EGFP to obtain a height profile given in the diagram below (Figure 2).
