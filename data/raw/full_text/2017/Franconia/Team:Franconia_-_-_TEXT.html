Biocompatible Elastic Artificial Muscle
Beam me up!
Abstract
The development of artificial muscles attracts wide interest for industrial and medical    applications. Regarding manufacturing, robotic devices with synthetic muscles are able to    handle complex-shaped materials more precisely. Moreover, artificial musculatures in medical    prostheses can improve the wearing comfort while conveying a rather natural feeling.    Currently, muscle-like contractions can be obtained by capacitor systems or by molecular    machines incorporating tissue. This project aims to replace the common materials in both    branches by biological tissue. While increasing ecological friendliness and the compatibility    with human tissue, those fabricated composites can compete with human biological    material.

Like a capacitor, the dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) comprises two lightweight and    flexible electrodes separated by an insulating elastomeric layer. In a first set of experiments,    the elastomer layers in the capacitor-based muscle need to be replaced by appropriate protein    structures. P-Pili with their excellent elastic properties and proteins with high amounts of    helical secondary architecture are to be tested for this approach. In a next step, the currently    used light weighted graphene or carbon nanotube layers need to be replaced by the Pili to    provide conductivity and flexibility comparable to the carbon nanotubes. Both fibril types can    be easily expressed in Geobacter sulflurreducens and Escherichia coli in a large scale, which    makes the overall system extremely feasible since one organism can provide the whole    material.
Another tissue with muscle-like contractions will be fabricated through polymers with    integrated molecular machines. Herein, the latter are based on azo dyes capable of having    their entire network contracted by light irradiation. The biopolymer matrix is fabricated by    Escherichia coli and consists of catcher-tag systems modified with a biotin-accepting anchor.    The molecular machines attach to the biopolymer tissue via biotin and biotin acceptor    interactions. Due to the crosslinking of the single protein strains the stiffness of the resulting    tissue can be adjusted accurately.
In both cases, the achieved tissues are cell-free and can immediately be adapted to the system.    Within the scope of the project, the construction of a DEA-prototype is planned, since the    realization of electrical stimuli is more feasible than through photo-induced signals.
