B.E.A.M.
The development of artificial muscles attracts wide interest for industrial and medical     applications. Regarding manufacturing, robotic devices with synthetic muscles are able to     handle softer materials more precisely. Moreover, artificial musculatures in medical     prostheses can improve the wearing comfort while conveying a rather natural feeling.     Currently, muscle-like contractions can be obtained by capacitor systems or by molecular     machines incorporating tissue. This project aims to replace the common materials in both     branches by biological tissue. While increasing ecological friendliness and the compatibility     with human tissue, those fabricated compositions can compete with human biological     material.

Pathomon
As a part of Team Franconia the Department of Würzburg is responsible for all the tedious and boring technical stuff,     which includes this website, graphic designs and the focus of our combined efforts:  The parallel reality game: “Pathomon”.
Since the world is such a dark and scary place, we decided it should be possible to make at least some of these threats visible, so it will be easier to face the threats to modern humanity and to do your part in making this wold a safer place.     With this purpose in mind and maybe to even teach some things to our playerbase, we created an app, that allows you to do something you probably always wanted: To see all the little germs, viruses and pathogens that squirm and writhe around you all the time.     By scanning markers which are distributed around the Covention Center of the Giant Jamboree, you can display the little troublemakers hiding behind them. And even better, you can fight and wipe them off the face of the earth.
