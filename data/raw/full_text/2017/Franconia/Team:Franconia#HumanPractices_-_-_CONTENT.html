All team members engaged in those
					projects with great enthusiasm and we think that we did some great work presenting the field of
					synthetic biology and the iGEM competition in general to the public.</P></DIV><H3>Integrated Human Practice</H3><P>Throughout our Human Practice projects starting from lab courses at school to presentation of our
				work to a broad community at the “Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften” we received a strong feedback
				from the people, what we must consider and how we can improve our project. Overall, visualization
				of our project was challenging in the first place. Here the school children showed us multiple ways,
				how people can understand our project better, without using to complex terms, which can only be
				understood by scientists. The Lego brick concept was convenient to demonstrate the working
				principle of our catcher tag system as well as the formation of our polymer and was further well-
				understood by non-scientists.
				Out trip to the “Bionicum” gave us an impression how nature fulfills motion and how we have to
				adjust our system to work as a muscle. Here, we realized that our attempt of a light-driven muscle is
				inferior to our electric device as the thickness of our muscle system limits the transmitting light.
				Hence, we focused more on the development and the pattern how we can fold the DEAs to reach
				high strength with low amounts of material.
				Finally, we have demonstrated the principle of our work at the “Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften” to
				a broad community. We could apply, what we have learnt during our Human Practice and our work
				in the lab. We were faced with many questions and bright ideas how to scale up the process and the
				purification by secretion of the protein instead of lyses to create a continuous supply. It was a
				crucial
				factor for the evaluation of our gaming app, where we benefited from the enthusiastic crowd of
				people.

				decided to do so, because in this lab-workshop we saw the biggest potential for us to be
				helpful and make an impact. A few years ago the German school system was reformed
				and the former nine years of “Gymnasium” were cut short to just eight years. We, the
				Team Franconia, live in Bavaria, a federal state who executed this reform as one of the
				first, fourteen years ago. This brought with it a lot of changes in the curricula of all
				grades, especially the last two years before graduation. To get most of the important
				topics into only eight instead of nine years, practical work experience was nearly
				completely withdrawn from curriculum. So, before graduation most pupils in Germany
				know the theory behind modern biological work in laboratories, but have never done it
				nor seen it in practice. To change that and fascinate soon-to- be university students in
				natural sciences we decided to visit local schools and do a small workshop about
				biological work.
				<BUTTON class="read-more">Read more</BUTTON></P><DIV class="read-more-content"><P>Since we were planning to do the workshop in the school building– not in
					our laboratory at the university – almost every experiment was unsuitable because of
					safety aspects. After long brainstorming sessions, we found three interesting
					experiments, neither demanding too little nor too much from the pupils: a simple DNA-
					extraction from strawberries, a gel electrophoresis of a plasmid in different conformations
					with a harmless DNA-dye and our “microcakes”, mixing ingredients, usually used to bake
					cakes, in Eppendorf tubes by using microliter pipettes, micro scales and vortexers. After
					contacting two schools in Erlangen, discussing the possibilities with the responsible
					biology teachers, planning the experiments and preparing the workshop, we held our
					very first workshop on the 24th of May 2017 at the Marie-Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen.</P></DIV><H3>Marie-Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen</H3><P>The teachers assembled a group of 13 interested pupils from their 11 th grade biology
				courses who were willing to spend their – usually free – Wednesday afternoon learning
				about iGEM, synthetic biology and how to work in laboratories. We prepared the DNA
				extraction, the gel electrophoresis and a power point presentation about us and the
				theory of the two experiments, everything being photographed by Alex. Starting the
				afternoon Alena told the pupils about iGEM, synthetic biology, our own project and why
				we do the workshop. Then Ariane took over to give them the theory behind the soon-to-
				be done experiments, covering what a gel electrophoresis is, how it works, why biologists
				use it that often, what one has to do to extract DNA and where the difficulties lay.
				<BUTTON class="read-more">Read more</BUTTON></P><DIV class="read-more-content"><P>
					After these theoretical 20 minutes, we started the practical work, supervised by Hannah,
					Bastian, Leonard and Ariane from our team, with preparing the gel run. We poured the
					gels before the workshop started, as this would have taken too long to have it done by
					the pupils. First the pupils had to be introduced to the microliter pipettes and train their
					pipetting skills. Therefore, we gave every student a stripe of parafilm with three drops of
					water on it, which they had to pipette up and down until they felt secure enough to take
					on the task of loading the gel with our DNA sample. After adding the loading dye to every
					sample, each pupil had to fill two gel pockets and the last to do so also had to start the
					gel run. While the gel ran, the DNA extraction was to be done. To get good results and as
					much visual DNA as possible, we decided to use strawberries, an octoploid organism. The
					protocol we used, was given to us by Dr. Hanh Nguyen, an employee at our university,
					who has already done this experiments at a school and could share her experiences with
					us. For this we want to thank her. In contrary to the gel electrophoresis, which had been
					done in groups of three to four, did their own DNA extraction. We proceeded step-by-
					step, every step followed by an explanation and depiction of what has been done and
					what it has been done for. Right in time to stop the gel run, we finished the DNA
					extraction, luckily, or probably more because of great work by the pupils, with good
					results, seeing strawberry DNA in almost every experiment. To visualize the results of
					the gel electrophoresis, we used an UV-transilluminator. Ending this afternoon of
					practical biological work, the pupils analyzed the DNA samples and determined the length
					of the plasmid used. After tidying up and cleaning all the tables, the pupils gave us their
					feedback about the workshop. All in all, this was a very successful afternoon, we learned

					a lot from it ourselves, had fun and hope that we helped the pupils getting an insight in
					the occupational field of genetic engineering. We want to say thank you to the Marie-
					Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen and the biology teachers for letting us organize this
					workshop, being so helpful with and enthusiastic about the idea. Of course, we were
					mindful of safety, too. We worked in a biology room, where eating and drinking is
					prohibited. Every student had to wear safety goggles and gloves, they had to change at
					least two times, during the whole workshop. We used no harmful substances and had
					safety sheets put on display.</P></DIV><H3>Christian-Ernst- Gymnasium Erlangen</H3><P>On Juli 11th, 2017 members of our iGEM team then visited the Christian-Ernst-
				Gymnasium in Erlangen, giving a workshop on iGEM and genetic engineering. Alena,
				Ann-Sophie, Benedikt, Hannah, Steffen, Ariane, Luise, Eva, Alex and Jonas met at
				7:30am to get all the last minute preparations done. After Alena, Ariane and Steffen
				informed the students about iGEM, genetical engineering and therefore ist risks and
				benefits. But the workshop should not stay as theoretical is that – basic biologic work
				techniques were coached by our team with the aid of a micro cake recipe: The students
				were able to “bake” a cake under laboratory like circumstances. Afterwards, our team
				members provided the students with information about university life and possible
				courses of study. All in all: a verysuccessful human practice project!</P><H3>Marie-Therese- Gymnasium Erlangen 2.0</H3><P>On July 13th 2017 we once again used the chance to promote our iGEM-project to the
				greater public: Again we visited the Marie-Therese- Gymnasium in Erlangen to offer our
				DNA extraction workshop. But not we were standing in front of the crowd to explain –
				but rather the students with whom we had held our workshop in May were pointing out
				the important steps to the visitors of the school’s Project Day “TraumVision 2017”. Our
				team members and students of MTG worked together as a “teaching team” to carry out
				the DNA extraction with parents, teachers of other subjects, siblings and other interested
				individuals. Not only small inquiries but also bigger problems could be solved by the
				teaching teams. Everybody was concentrated and the biological work flow could not be
				stopped, whether it would have been due to the heat (it was a very hot summer day) or
				due to loud music being played by the school’s marching band in the adjacent
				schoolyard. In the end everybody helped to clean up the classroom – all in all: another
				very successful Human Practice project and we also got featured on the <A target="_blank" href="http://www.mtg-erlangen.de/index.php/unterricht/unterrichtsfaecher/biologie/302- fau-

				email from one the employees at the “Bionicum” in Nuremberg. The Bionicum is an institution of the
				Bavarian Environment Agency, dedicated to bionic, with a visitor centre in the Nuremberg Zoo. They
				cooperate with different research groups, that work on movement mechanism borrowed from the animal or
				plant kingdom. One of these research groups works on developing bionic Dielectric Elastomer Actuators,
				which is why they took notice of us and our work. After exchanging some emails about our project and
				their work, our team was invited to visit the Bionicum. On a sunny day in August six of our team members
				drove to the Nuremberg Zoo and were warmly welcomed by the employees of the Bionicum. After showing us
				around the visitor centre and providing us with very interesting insights into the world of bionic, we
				sat down to drink a coffee and talk – all between giraffes and meerkats!
				<BUTTON class="read-more">Read more</BUTTON></P><DIV class="read-more-content"><P> After explaining our project, we learned about their experiences with bionic research and their
					public engagement. We received great feedback on how we could use what we already know from nature
					in our project. Thereby, we i. A. realised that for our chemical approach to achieve muscle like
					movement of the tissue, a molecular machine triggered by a voltage – as it is in all animals –
					instead of light would be more effective. We also heard how they teach school classes about bionic
					and connect with the public on this topic. After this very productive exchange, we explored the
					interactive exhibition in the visitor centre, where we learned a lot about mechanisms in nature that
					are used in technology. We realized, that the basic idea of bionic – making technology that
					resembles nature – is the exact inverse of the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM – making biology
					that resembles technology. This is precisely the reason why the combination of both should lead to a
					successful implementation, as it combines what already works in nature with individual adjustments.
					Our tour through the visitor centre ended with a very enjoyable performance of Nao, the sweetest
					robot we have ever seen. Here, we were told that after 15 minutes of performance he had to be
					charged for at least two hours to refill its batteries. Thus, we experienced the drawbacks of
					currently used robot drives, having a very high energy consumption, that we prior only knew
					theoretically.</P></DIV><P>To sum up, we had a very interesting and good time at the Bionicum. We learned a whole lot of things,
				many of which we could integrate into our project. We can very much recommend visiting the Bionicum in
				the Nuremberg Zoo to anyone, as it has a very thought-through and fascinating exhibition. Finally, we
				again want to thank the Bionicum and its employees for inviting us, talking to us and doing such great
				work. We really hope that we can plan a public engagement project together next year with the iGEM 2018
				team!</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="langeNacht" class="cd-section"><DIV class="middle-banner langeNacht"><DIV class="banner-heading"><H1>Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften</H1></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content"><P>Scientific institutions holding lectures and demonstrations for the general public – that’s the main
				concept of what in Germany is called a “Long Night of the Sciences”. From 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., the public
				can visit campuses, lecture halls and other premises of the universities and get to know about current
				research topics and results. In the area of Franconia’s cities of Nuremberg, Fuerth and Erlangen there
				is also one of these “Nights of the Sciences” – in which our iGEM-team was able to participate this year
				regarding a presentation of iGEM itself, our project and our results. We were able to get the whole team
				to look after our stand and tell the general public about our time with iGEM. It also served as some
				kind of rehearsal for our presentation at the iGEM Giant Jamboree. Team members from Erlangen presented
				the biological and chemical parts of our work as well as our engagement in collaborations and Human
				Practise projects – our colleagues from Würzburg presented their app and enacted a survey about what

				that it will not cause damage to the environment. A crucial factor is to prevent the genetically
				modified microorganisms from entering the environment. As we were working with two stems Geobacter
				sulfurreducens and Escherichia coli we had to rely on two different approaches for this goal. As
				Geobacter sulfurreducens can only survive under strictly anaerobic conditions, that task is simple to
				achieve as the culture dies immediately when exposed to the atmosphere.
				For E. coli we chose a cell-free approach for our tissue to prevent contamination of the
				environment. This consideration takes into account that cells in the tissue lower the performance of our
				azo-dye based muscle as the cells in the tissue will not be contracted but remain as buffer likely
				preventing a strong contraction. In the dielectric elastomer actuator tissue the E. coli cells will not
				survive the mechanical stress in the tissue, which will rapidly lead to ruptures in the device. A
				further aspect to work with a cell-free material is to prevent damage to the material by the bacteria
				themselves as they may consume a significant amount of the proteins.
				To obtain this cell-free protein material lyses of the E. coli cells is necessary followed by
				purification via nickel NTA column chromatography. This procedure leads to pure protein solutions, which
				can further be manufactured to the desired tissue.
