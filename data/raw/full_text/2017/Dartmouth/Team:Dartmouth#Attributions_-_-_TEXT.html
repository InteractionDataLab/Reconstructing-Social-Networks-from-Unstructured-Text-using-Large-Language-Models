Dartmouth iGEM was responsible for much of the work in organizing and running the team, conducting experimental protocols, creating the wiki page, and acquiring sources of funding. However, we would not have been able to succeed as a team without the help from those mentioned below:
Professor Lee Lynd
For generously providing reagents and lab space for our team.
Daniel Olson, PhD
For refining our experimental protocols and helping design our BioBrick parts.
Mary Kay Brown
For providing us a temporary lab space and allowing us access to lab materials.
Irving Energy Institute at Dartmouth
For supporting Dartmouth iGEM and providing generous funding for the team.
Center for Professional Development
For supporting our work through SELF Grant.
Joseph J. Helble, Dean of Thayer School of Engineering
