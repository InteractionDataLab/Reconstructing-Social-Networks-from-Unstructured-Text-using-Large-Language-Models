Pf0-1 Pseudomonas Fluorescens Electrocompetency Prep
Innoculate 6 mL of liquid LB or Pseudomonas Minimal Media with Pf0-1 and grow overnight
Split overnight into 1.5 mL aliquots and centrifuge at 16,000x g, discard supernatant
Resuspend cell pellet with 1 mL of 300 mM sucrose in water solution
Centrifuge at 16,000x g and discard supernatant
Repeat resuspension and centrifuge step
Resuspend cell pellet with 50 uL or 100 uL 300 mM sucrose in water solution
Pf0-1 Pseudomonas Fluorescens Electroporation
Retrieve a 50 uL or 100 uL vial of electrocompentence prepped cells
Add 2 uL of DNA directly into vial of cells and mix by flicking
Transfer mixture to a 2 mm Electroporation cuvette
On BioRad Gene Pulser, pulse with 2.5 kV, 200 Ohm, 25 uF settings
