dedicated people. We would like to take the chance to thank these people here for all of their help. It
really means a lot to us.<CENTER><H2><FONT color="#C1D35D">2017 Team and Project</FONT></H2>

Team recruitment was started in February and bi-weekly meetings were held in March to
flesh out the 2017 project idea. By the end of March, we had decided to continue working on the project
from the previous year: Cloning the cellulose degradation pathway into <I>E. coli</I> for efficient conversion of
wood waste to glucose, then production of ethanol by yeast.
iGEM elections for team leads were held in April. We elected the president and 5 team leads: Wet Lab,
Dry Lab, Web Design, Fundraising and Human Practices. Our team was 24 undergraduate students at the
beginning of April. Over the course of April and May we developed our project, and the goals we wanted
to complete before the Jamboree.
Starting in June we began mining the synthetic metagenomic library for enzymes to send for synthesis. In June we also started building the metagenomic cosmid library which
continued, with much troubleshooting, until the end of October. Cloning began immediately after our
first IDT shipment arrived, and assay development started early September. This continued into late
October.
In June we also started contacting people for our science communication project. We wanted to ensure
that our science project would be understood by the most people possible. Human practices finished all interviews by early October. 
Our project was developed by undergraduate students at Dalhousie University with the help of the following people.<CENTER><H2><FONT color="#C1D35D">Faculty Support of the Project</FONT></H2>
Drs. Craig McCormick, John Rohde, and Lois Murray helped form and direct the project from the
beginning.
Drs. McCormick and Rohde provided their lab and many reagents to get us started.
Dr. Rohde provided presentation coaching and formed a journal club, separate to the Think of the PLoSibilities blog. 
Dr. Murray arranged our own iGEM laboratory space during the summer.

Shubenacadie Wildlife Park provided the porcupine fecal samples and diet data sheets.
Drs. Trevor Charles, Juigun Cheng, and John Hiel (University of Waterloo) welcomed us
into their lab and taught us how to create a cosmid library for functional metagenomics. Dr. Charles also
provided us with <I> E.coli </I> strain HB101, and cosmid pJC8.
Dr. Melanie Dobson provided metagenomic library mentorship and support.
Dr. Jason Leblanc gave us access to his pulse-field gel electrophoresis equipment and offered instruction and supervision during our first attempt.

metagenomic sequencing.
Nicholas Boudreau, Jacob Sicheri, and Matt Curry worked on carrying out the pipeline. <CENTER><H2><FONT color="#C1D35D">Human Practices and Outreach Support</FONT></H2><FONT color="#C1D35D">General:</FONT>

Emma Finlayson-Trick provided dedicated mentorship to the human practices team. Emma helped steer
our ideas and kept us in-check for deadlines, as well as provided creative solutions to the ideas we
wanted to investigate. Emma also created our blog: “Think of the PLOSibilities” in
collaboration with PLoS journals to provide lay summaries of scientific articles.
Team members that worked on Human Practices were Angela Tsai, Nicholas Boudreau, Francis Routeledge, and Mackenzie Thornbury. <FONT color="#C1D35D">Outreach:</FONT>
