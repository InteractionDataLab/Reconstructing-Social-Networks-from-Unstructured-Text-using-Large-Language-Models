University of Waterloo We provided cloning expertise to their wet lab team, to help specifically with primer design. Our figure can be found here . We filled out their survey which was sent around to see if 3D printing could be used as a cost-effective way to make lab equipment. They welcomed us into their lab space and created an open area to discuss the details of our projects currently, and in the future. They gave us priceless training in the building of functional metagenomic libraries and told us about the magic cloning helper Guanosine. University of Toronto We answered questions about our iGEM team over skype to help them create a podcast series on iGEM. They filled out an in-depth questionnaire on science communication to help us get insight from a young group of scientists. University of Calgary/Canadian iGEM We provided the University of Calgary iGEM team a two-page summary of our work for their monthly newsletter in August, September, October, and November. They provided a platform for Canadian iGEM teams to explain their projects and create a community between teams that are separated by thousands of kilometers.
