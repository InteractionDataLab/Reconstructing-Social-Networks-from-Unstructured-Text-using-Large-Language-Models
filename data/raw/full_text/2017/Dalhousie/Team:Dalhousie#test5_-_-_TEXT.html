Dalhousie iGEM 2017
Welcome! The goal of our project is to convert cellulose into glucose, which can be used for biofuel. Let us show you how!
Softwood waste from the lumber industry contains cellulose, which can be turned into glucose and used to make biofuel. 01
We hypothesized that the porcupine microbiome must contain an enzyme that can break down cellulose, as bark is food. 02
We mined the porcupineâ€™s microbiome to identify the enzyme that was able to break down wood. 03
We created a metagenomic library of the genes able to code this enzyme as well as novel enzymes. 04
We put these genes into E.coli to see if they could then digest cellulose down. 05
We put the E.coli into a bioreactor with cellulose to see if it gets broken down. In the future this can be combined with yeast to transform in finally into biofuel! 06
