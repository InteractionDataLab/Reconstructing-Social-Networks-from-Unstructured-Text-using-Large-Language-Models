Protocols
Fluorophore Assessment of Glycosidase Activity
Purpose of this protocol is to assess the enzymatic activity of glycosidases using fluorophores conjugated to substrates of interest (such as cellobiose or xylobiose). Once the enzyme of interest cleaves substrate, the fluorophore is released enabling quantification of enzymatic activity.
Cosmid Library Generation
Purpose of this protocol is to generate a library of cosmid clones that are representative of the microbiome of the porcupine for screening for novel enzymes.
Coomassie Blue Stain
To visual total protein in a given sample.
Western Blot
To identify specific amino acid sequences of a protein, or tag, using fluorescently-tagged antibodies.
Overnight Bacterial Batch Culture
Purpose of this protocol is to grow up single colonies of bacteria for use.
Cloning Overview
Purpose of this overview is to isolate and clone genes of interest into an appropriate plasmid and then introduce the recombinant DNA molecule into E. coli.
Congo Red Media Generation
The purpose of this protocol is to assay carboxymethyl cellulose degradation via a pH change detectable by the dye Congo Red as differentially coloured halos around colonies of bacteria.
Congo Red Overlay Assay for Carboxymethylcellulose Degradation
Concentration protocol to concentrate DNA isolating using the PowerFecal Extraction kit.
0.8% Agarose Gel
Purpose of this protocol is to create an agarose gel for visualizing and extracting DNA.
Cellobiose Media Generation
The purpose of this protocol is to create solid growth media containing cellobiose to measure beta-glucosidase activity.
LB Agar Selection Media Plate Generation
Purpose of this protocol is to generate solid growth media containing LB and an antibiotic of choice for selective growth of successful clones following transformation.
Heat Shock Transformation
Purpose of this protocol is to introduce plasmid DNA into E. coli cells.
Carboxymethylcellulose Media Generation
The purpose of this protocol is to create solid growth media containing both carboxymethylcellulose and glucose for measuring endoglucanase activity.
M9 Salts Generation
Purpose of this protocol is to generate a salt solution for E. coli growth.
