Collaborations
The Tokyo Tech team and our team.
Our team received mentoring from team TokyoTech when we met up on September 23rd. We received feedback and advice about the modeling of our data, as well as helpful guidance for how to best represent our project motivations and research.
Outside of other iGEM teams, we also heavily collaborated with other schools across the world through a virtual pre-medical club. Conducted through Global Online Academy, we shared our research and knowledge of colorectal cancer with other students, facilitating discussion about this cancer and inspiring other outreach programs among their respective communities.
