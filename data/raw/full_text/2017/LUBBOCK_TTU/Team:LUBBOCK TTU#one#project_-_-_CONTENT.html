Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.</P><P><B>Gold Medal Criterion #3</B></P><P>
To complete for the gold medal criterion #3, please describe your work on this page and fill out the description on your <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Judging/Judging_Form">judging form</A>. To achieve this medal criterion, you must convince the judges that your team has gained insight into your project from modeling. You may not convince the judges if your model does not have an effect on your project design or implementation.

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project.
