  SafetyAs a measurement team, our chemical and biological agents are strictly for use in the lab, keeping safety concerns at a minimum.
Safe Project Design
We chose to work with a common chassis, S. cerevisiae BY4741 (Mata his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), which has been well characterized for safe use within the lab. We are making biobricks two fluorescent reporters, mneon green and SfGFP, induced by high levels of calcium within the yeast cell. Both our chassis and our parts are nonpathogenic and therefore fall under BSL 1.
Safe Lab Work
All of our members went through the TTUHSC Laboratory Safety Essentials course which included general lab safety, lab chemical safety, lab biological safety, and lab hazard identification before being allowed to access the lab. These online modules explained standard safety procedures, chemical handling, waste disposal procedures, and emergency preparedness. In addition, senior members and advisors provided hands on training for laboratory practices, including sterile technique and safe use of equipment.
