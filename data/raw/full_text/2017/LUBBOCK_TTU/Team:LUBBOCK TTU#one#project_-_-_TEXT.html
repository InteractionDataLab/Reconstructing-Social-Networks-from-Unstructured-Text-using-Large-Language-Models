Description
Tell us about your project, describe what moves you and why this is something important for your team.
What should this page contain?
A clear and concise description of your project.
A detailed explanation of why your team chose to work on this particular project.
References and sources to document your research.
Use illustrations and other visual resources to explain your project.
Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.

Design
Design is the first step in the design-build-test cycle in engineering and synthetic biology. Use this page to describe the process that you used in the design of your parts. You should clearly explain the engineering principles used to design your project.
This page is different to the "Applied Design Award" page. Please see the Applied Design page for more information on how to compete for that award.
What should this page contain?
Explanation of the engineering principles your team used in your design
Discussion of the design iterations your team went through
Experimental plan to test your designs

InterLab
Bronze Medal Criterion #4
Standard Tracks: Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study and/or improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2017 part number range.
For teams participating in the InterLab study , all work must be shown on this page.
Contribution
Bronze Medal Criterion #4
Standard Tracks: Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study (to be documented on your InterLab page) and/or improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2017 part number range. Teams who are working on improving the characterization of an existing part should document their experimental design here, along with an explanation for why they chose that part to improve. Data can also be shown here, but it MUST also be documented on the part's Main Page in the Registry.
Special Tracks: Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project related to BioBricks. This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
Model
Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
Gold Medal Criterion #3
To complete for the gold medal criterion #3, please describe your work on this page and fill out the description on your judging form . To achieve this medal criterion, you must convince the judges that your team has gained insight into your project from modeling. You may not convince the judges if your model does not have an effect on your project design or implementation.
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
Best Model Special Prize
To compete for the Best Model prize , please describe your work on this page  and also fill out the description on the judging form . Please note you can compete for both the gold medal criterion #3 and the best model prize with this page.
You must also delete the message box on the top of this page to be eligible for the Best Model Prize.
Inspiration
Here are a few examples from previous teams:
Manchester 2016
TU Delft 2016
ETH Zurich 2014
Waterloo 2014
Results
Here you can describe the results of your project and your future plans.
What should this page contain?
Clearly and objectively describe the results of your work.
Future plans for the project.
Considerations for replicating the experiments.
You should also describe what your results mean:
Interpretation of the results obtained during your project. Don't just show a plot/figure/graph/other, tell us what you think the data means. This is an important part of your project that the judges will look for.
Show data, but remember all measurement and characterization data must be on part pages in the Registry.
Consider including an analysis summary section to discuss what your results mean. Judges like to read what you think your data means, beyond all the data you have acquired during your project.
Project Achievements
You can also include a list of bullet points (and links) of the successes and failures you have had over your summer. It is a quick reference page for the judges to see what you achieved during your summer.
A list of linked bullet points of the successful results during your project
A list of linked bullet points of the unsuccessful results during your project. This is about being scientifically honest. If you worked on an area for a long time with no success, tell us so we know where you put your effort.

Demonstrate
Gold Medal Criterion #4
Teams that can show their system working under real world conditions are usually good at impressing the judges in iGEM. To achieve gold medal criterion #4, convince the judges that your project works. There are many ways in which your project working could be demonstrated, so there is more than one way to meet this requirement. This gold medal criterion was introduced in 2016, so check our what 2016 teams did to achieve a their gold medals!
Please see the 2017 Medals Page for more information.
What should we do for our demonstration?
Standard teams
If you have built a proof of concept system, you can demonstrate it working under real world conditions. If you have built a biological device that is intended to be a sensor, can you show it detecting whatever it is intended to sense. If it is intended to work in the field, you can show how this might work using a simulated version in the lab, or a simulation of your device in the field. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Special track teams
Special track teams can achieve this medal criterion by bringing their work to the Jamboree and showcasing it in the track event. Art & Design, Measurement, Hardware and Software tracks will all have showcase events at the Giant Jamboree. Please note biological materials must not be taken out of the lab.
Improve
For teams seeking to improve upon a previous part or project, you should document all of your work on this page. Please remember to include all part measurement and characterization data on the part page on the Regisrty. Please include a link to your improved part on this page.
Gold Medal Criterion #2
Standard Tracks: Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze #4 and silver #1.
Special Tracks: Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster.
This is a bronze medal requirement. Please see the Medals requirements page for more details.
Why is this page needed?
The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
What should this page have?
General Support
Project support and advice
Fundraising help and advice
Lab support
Difficult technique support
Project advisor support

Thanks and acknowledgements for all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
Can we base our project on a previous one?
Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.
