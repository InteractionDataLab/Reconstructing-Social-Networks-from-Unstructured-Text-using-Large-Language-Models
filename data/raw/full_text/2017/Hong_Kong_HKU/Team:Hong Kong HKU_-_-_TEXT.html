About this project
Greetings!          By focusing on the intriguing world of diagnostic probes, our project aims to design an effective DNA nanostructure for Disease detection. Contrary to HKU iGEM Team 2016 design, we have come up with an alternative tetrahedron structure, in which the 3D tetrahedron is only formed upon binding to the target sequence. Our ultimate goal is to enable our functional DNA nanostructure to be synthesized and self-assembled inside E. coli. They will detect specific biomarkers expressed in the diseased cells. This website will guide you on our journey throughout the iGEM Competition 2017. Click to explore and enjoy!
