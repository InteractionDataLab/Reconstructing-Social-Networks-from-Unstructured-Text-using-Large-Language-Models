Fourth International InterLab Measurement Study
Description
This year, the HKU iGEM 2017 team participated in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study. The iGEM Interlab study was initiated in 2014 as a way to improve the replicability and comparability of measurement data, not only in the discipline of synthetic biology but in the field of science as a whole.
Green fluorescent protein, is a very commonly used measurement marker, was chosen to be measured in the study. A number of RBS test devices intended to increase the reliability and precision of gene expression were also studied. Test devices 1-6, namely BBa_J364000, BBa_J364001, BBa_J364002, BBa_J364003, BBa_J364004 and BBa_J364005, along with a positive control (BBa_I20270) and a negative control (BBa_R0040) were used. All of the devices were in pSB1C3 plasmid backbones and hence, were transformed into competent E. coli (DH5-alpha) cells onto agar plates containing the antibiotic, chloramphenicol. The measurements were then performed with the help of a plate reader (Varioskan Flash 4.00.53).
