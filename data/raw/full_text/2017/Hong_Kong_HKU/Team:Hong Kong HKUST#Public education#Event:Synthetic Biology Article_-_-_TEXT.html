Aim
- To share knowledge about synthetic biology
- To change people’s misleading attitudes towards GMOs and synthetic biology field acknowledged from the feedbacks from focus groups in Science Park
Description
Since we got feedbacks from Science Park’s participants, the results from survey implies that people’s attitudes prone more to the negative impact of GMOs, even though they did not have in depth understanding regarding biological engineered product. We therefore created an article tackling this problem, and posted on facebook where several followers are from Science Park events. We wish this article can more or less contributes to people’s well-thought point of view.
