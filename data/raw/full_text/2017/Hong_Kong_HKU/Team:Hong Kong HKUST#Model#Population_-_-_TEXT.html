Population Dynamics
1 Overview
In this section, we want to model the proportion of the plasmid that is knocked out after the addition of Cre when         accounting for population dynamics, namely cell replication and death. Here, as before, we wish to ﬁnd how the gene         of interest (GOI) concentration will eventually decrease. Here, we assume that the population has reached carrying capacity and so the rate of cell replication is equal to the rate of cell death. We also assume all cells with the construct have Cre constitutively         produced after the activation of the construct.
As described in the Cre module model, the GOI is separated from the origin of replication (ORI) when Cre recombinase         cuts the construct at the lox sites.
During each cell replication, all plasmids with an ORI will be replicated before the cell divides. If an unrecombined         construct (with both the GOI and the ORI) replicates, it would create another copy of itself. Any plasmids with only         the GOI cannot replicate as they lack an ORI. The plasmids with only an ORI would also replicate.
Here, we will refer to the proportion of unrecombined plasmid as S, the proportion of the recombined version (having         the GOI and ORI in separate plasmids) as P, and the proportion of ORI-only plasmids from the replication of the recombined         version as N.
Referring to the figure below, during cell replication, when S replicates, it will generate a copy of S, while when P and N replicate,         they will generate a copy of N. Because we assume the cell population is at the carrying capacity, meaning that the         rate of cell replication will be equal to the rate of cell death. Thus, we will only have to consider the replication         and death mechanism for P because the rates are balanced for S and N.
Because we could not conﬁrm the reaction constants for lox66 and lox71, we decided to proceed with the model using         the simpliﬁed reaction kinetics for lox.
Diagram illustrates a plasmid (S) undergoing recombination process (the knockout of origin of replication), resulting in proportion of plasmid (P) that consists of GOI but does not undergo plasmid replication and another proportion of plasmid (N) that only has origin of replication and undergoes plasmid replication.
2 Approximations and Simpliﬁcations
2.1 Recombination Simpliﬁcation
In this model, we consider P separately from N as a diﬀerent entity. That is, P is a GOI plasmid and an ORI plasmid,         while N is an ORI plasmid that does not have a corresponding GOI copy. We make this simpliﬁcation so that we may         use the ﬁtted model from the Cre module.
2.2 Constant Cre Recombination Rate Approximation
In this model, we assume that Cre is constitutively produced, and that the forward and reverse reaction constants remain         constant. In reality, the concentration may have changes, such as during replication, but because the amount of time         spent under such conditions should be short, we decide to simplify the model by not considering them.
3 System of Reactions
We can describe the model as elaborated above with this set of reactions:
The ﬁrst two reactions come from considering the death and replication of P respectively, while the second two come         from the ﬁtted result of the Cre model.
4 Simulations
To simulate the system, we implemented Euler’s method for approximating ordinary diﬀerential equations and applied         the approximations as stated.
Fig. 1 Simulation of knockout efficiency with cell death and replication
As we can see from the graph, the concentration of both S and P gradually approach 0 over time.
This is because the replication of P only produces N while cell death would reduce P. As P decreases, the reaction         equilibrium between S and P is pushed in the forward direction in accordance with Le Chatlier’s principle, and so         S will also decrease. Meanwhile, N’s proportion is being increased do to the replication of P and eventually all         of the plasmids are in the form of N.
This model suggests that if our construct works correctly, then all of the original construct will eventually be knocked         out given enough time if the cell culture is at carrying capacity.
