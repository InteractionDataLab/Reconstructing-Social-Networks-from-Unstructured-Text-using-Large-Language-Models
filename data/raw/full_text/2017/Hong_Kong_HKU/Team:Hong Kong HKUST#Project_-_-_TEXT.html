Our Project
To control the expression in a cell population, it is essential that the action of quorum sensing is fast and sensitive enough!
This aims to control the time for an inserted gene of interest to function before being knocked out by Cre recombinase.
The function of the Recombination module is to knockout the gene of interest from the plasmid.
Our project can applied to various application in the future.
