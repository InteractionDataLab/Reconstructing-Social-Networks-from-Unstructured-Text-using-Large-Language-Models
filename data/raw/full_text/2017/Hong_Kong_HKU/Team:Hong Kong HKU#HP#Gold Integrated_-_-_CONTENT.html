Among the survey takers were medical workers from various fields (General Physician, Neurosurgeon, Paediatrician, and intern). They reflected that the accuracy of the diagnostic tests is the most important, followed by the ease of implementing the test. Cost-effectiveness is also considered. </P><H2> Integrating the result into our project </H2><P> Modifications were then made to our DNA nanostructure design after obtaining the above invaluable feedback. Our design is optimized to improve the absolute readout, and we aim to further improve the signal: noise ratio to reduce false positives. Instead of ABTS, we will use a simpler fluorescent-based assay for speedier results. We are also looking into result indicators as simple as a color change, as well as prototyping our product as a diagnostic kit that can be used easily by frontline medical workers. </P><P>Since our project concerns a diagnostic method of Huntington's disease, our team believe that we should have a first-hand understanding of what frontline medical workers need. For this, the human practice's team conducted a marketing research. Among the test takers, we have General Physician, Neurosurgeon, and Paediatrician, as well as an intern. </P><H2>Integrating the result into our project</H2><P> Under synergy with the laboratory team, these factors are well considered when designing the DNA, in hopes that the product will fit consumer needs and easy for them operate. Here are the considerations and changes made: </P><P>Since the most concern is the accuracy of the test, we have optimised the design to focus on decreasing the signal to noise ratio. Upon completion of our DNA, absolute readout would be our next step in the modification. We would want to fulfill another important consideration in diagnostic devices: duration of the test. We would be changing our assay from ABTS to an easier fluorescent based assay so that results can be easily observed in a shorter duration. </P><P> We understand that a diagnostic device should be easy to work with and should give apparent result indicators. To bring our product to the next level, be it a care diagnostic device, we are looking into result indicators as simple as a blood test, or a color change. We will be looking into prototyping our product as a diagnostic kit that can be used easily by frontline medical workers.</P><P> Special gratitude to Dr. Saumitra Sarkar and Dr. Avijit for leaving their words of encouragement to our project! </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
