Aim
- To share this year’s HKUST iGEM project to public in Hong Kong.
Description
Throughout this summer, we have encountered many challenges, and also gained experience from lab and human practices. It is our time to share what we know and have done so far to public. We value that our knowledge is not only acquired from laboratory experience and interview with particular focus groups, but also from all public sources. Inno-carnival is a good opportunity to raise awareness  of biological safety issues.
