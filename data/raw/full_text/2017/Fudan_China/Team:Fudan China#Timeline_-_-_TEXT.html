Experiments
Overview
We began our project early in this year, but wasted lots of time on molecular cloning. We were making mistakes and debugging during most of the time. In July, we tried to build the memory sequential structures at first but failed at last because of leakage. Later, orthogonality of five integrases we have was tested. At the same time, we were tring to change promoter in our two-signal system and still working on this now. Furthermore, we have engaged in InterLab in the mid-summer. Efficiency of five integrases was tested in late September and October.
