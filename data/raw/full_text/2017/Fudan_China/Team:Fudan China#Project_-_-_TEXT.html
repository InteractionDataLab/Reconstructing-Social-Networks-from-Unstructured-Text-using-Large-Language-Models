Description
As it has been known to us since we were very young, memory is related to our mind and is able to be stored and retrieved about our pasts. Now, biological memory has been defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus. Cellular memory devices with cell or cell population have...
Two-signal system
To memorize a dynamic changing process of one signal or serial signal, we have raised an idea of constructing a unique memory device with sequential memory structure, called MemOrderY. Besides the signal we want to record, the Target signal,...
Multi-signal system
Of course, recording one changing signal in only two time periods is not enough for us to solve real-world problems. As a result, we have further designed multi-signal system based on two-signal system, which records one changing signal in more than two time periods...
Parts
For this year’s iGEM competition, our team has chosen to submit three integrases CDS and their corresponding attB and attP sites. We have also submitted the attB and attP sites of phiC31 as improved parts. In our experiments, we tested all 5 integrases,...
