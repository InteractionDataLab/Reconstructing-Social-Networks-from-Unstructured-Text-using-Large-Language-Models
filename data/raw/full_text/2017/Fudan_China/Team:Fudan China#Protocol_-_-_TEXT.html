Protocol
On this page, we would like to share with you the protocols that we have been using over the competition. Here you can find the exact methods we use to generate our data and results.
Chemical transformation
Materials
LB broth

Competent E. coli
Ice
Selection plates
Methods
Thaw 100µL competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes
Add:
10 µl DNA from a ligation reaction mix or
10-100ng DNA of a known plasmid
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 90 seconds. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 2 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 900 µl of room temperature LB media into the mixture.
Incubate at 37°C and 200-250 rpm for 30-60 minutes.
Spread:
For ligation reaction DNA: 100µl of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate. If the clonies were sparse, for the rest of 900 µL:
Pellet cells at 8000rpm for 3 minutes
Remove and dispense 800 µL of supernatant
Re-suspend cells by pipetting
Plate resuspended cells as above
For known plasmid: 10 & 100 µL of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate. If the clonies were sparse, for the rest of 890 µL:
Pellet cells at 8000rpm for 3 minutes
Remove and dispense 800 µL of supernatant
Re-suspend cells by pipetting
Plate resuspended cells as above
Incubate overnight at 37°C with plates upside down.
