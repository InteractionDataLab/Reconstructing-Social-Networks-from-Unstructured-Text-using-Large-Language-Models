As one of the most important local competitions, we visited this exhibition to explore and exchange idea with the participants. Moreover, since HKU team has set up a booth there, we met with them to share each other’s progress and further discuss our works.
School sharing session
In October, we held a sharing session in assembly in front of our teachers and students. Apart from briefly introduced the latest DNA nanotechnology to them, we also present our work done this summer.
