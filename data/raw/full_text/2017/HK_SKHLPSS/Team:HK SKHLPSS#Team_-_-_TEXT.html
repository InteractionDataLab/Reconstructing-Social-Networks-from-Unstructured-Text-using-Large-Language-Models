Our Team
Our School
Our team members are from S.K.H. Li Ping Secondary School, a co-educational secondary school in Hong Kong. Providing first-class education and having gained well-deserved reputation in the society,  our school excels in various aspects, especially in STEM education. For this reason, we are always given great opportunities to participate in different science competitions, from local ones to overseas ones, so that our horizons in the science world can be considerably broadened.
