Due to the restriction of Hong Kong high school laboratories, we are thankful to have iGEM HKU, who has collaborated with us the Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and cloning part of our experiments. Their helping hand is exceptionally important to us so that we could be able to complete our investigation. For instance, PAGE result serves as a crucial proof for our assembly of the nano-cube. It also proves that the biomarker of the H3N2 virus was able to bind with the nano-cube. All these evidence are essential to prove the progress in our project.
Besides, HKU team had paid a visit to organize two workshops for our team in order to extend our knowledge in DNA nanotechnology and gave us useful advice for our design and experimental stage throughout the project. For detail, please visit our Workshop and Idea Exchange page.
We would like to once again express our gratitude to iGEM HKU for assisting us in our experiments and organizing various kinds of workshops for us.
