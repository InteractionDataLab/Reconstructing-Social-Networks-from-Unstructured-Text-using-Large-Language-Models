Design
Since our previous studies only focused on 2-dimensional structure of nano-device, we would like to explore the feasibility of a 3-dimensional structure of nano-device.
Fig.3. The nano-cube is designed according to Watson & Crick’s principle. Under guanine-riched sequence, it is able to bind with specific target strand to form a G-quadruplex. The G-quadruplex will enhance the peroxidase activity of hemin and lead to the peroxidation of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) giving a colorimetric signal. The degree of peroxidase activity indicates the concentration of the target.
In our design, eight single-stranded DNAs are used to form a DNA Nano-cube. This cube is designed so that one side of the cube is originally open. We fit in the corresponding base pairs of this side so that the presence of the target H3N2 virus strands would induce the closing of the cube and lead to the formation of G-quadruplex.
The eight oligos we chose and the nano-cube we designed are listed below as reference.

The colours show how the oligos bind with each other. We used DNA sequence mimicking the RNA sequence to do the test first because of stability problem.

After obtaining positive result in using DNA sequence, we would also like to check whether our design could successfully bind with RNA of H3N2 virus. Hence, the above RNA sequence of H3N2 virus was ordered for further study.
The above DNA and RNA strand are sponsored by Integrated DNA Technologies.
