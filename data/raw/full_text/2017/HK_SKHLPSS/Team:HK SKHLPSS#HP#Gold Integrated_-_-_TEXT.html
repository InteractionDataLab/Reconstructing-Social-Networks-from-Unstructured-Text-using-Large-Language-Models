Human Practices
We know deeply that our experiment and design is interrelated to the community. In fact, our purpose of this project is to provide a cheaper, faster yet a more specific and precise method for diagnosis of H3N2 virus. Therefore, apart from the experimental and designing work, we put much effort on human practices as well. These human practices categorized as local competition, workshops, idea exchange and public engagement. Details are shown in below and Local competition and workshops page.
Idea Exchange
Biosafety Sharing Session by HKU iGEM
Six iGEM teams were gathered  to attend the workshop organised by iGEM HKU this August.
Two of our members presented our progress during the workshop.
Other members also attended the workshop.
Staff from DIYBIO Company Hong Kong held a safety talk for teams.

On 11th August, 2017 several iGEM teams were gathered in the University of Hong Kong to share their projects. And a Biosafety Talk was conducted by the DIYBIO company of Hong Kong.
The six project sharing iGEM teams were:
Hong_Kong_HKU (University of Hong Kong)a
Hong_Kong_HKUST (University of Science and Technology)
Hong_Kong-CUHK (the Chinese University of Hong Kong)
SUSTech_Shenzhen (Southern University of Science and Technology)
Hong_Kong_UCCKE (United Christian College (Kowloon East))
HK_SKHLPSS (S.K.H. Li Ping Secondary School)
Each team had fifteen minutes for the presentation. Also, team investigators and advisors were presented to give their advice to the team members. Finally, Professor Julian Tanner of the HKU School of Biomedical Sciences gave us an encouraging speech and a summary to all the participants. All these were valuable and useful to our project. We were much clear about the project objectives and also learnt more about the importance of the gel electrophoresis experiments to our project.
This kind of idea exchange is also exceptionally important to our project in the way that we could listen to others what we could do to enhance our works. All opinions are so valuable that we might have omitted before, boosting our confidence in designing our nano-cube for iGEM competition.
Public Engagement
Joint School Science Exhibition (JSSE)
13 members were gathered with iGEM HKU in JSSE.
Project progress were exchanged for both teams.
Previous Next
As one of the most important local competitions, we visited this exhibition to explore and exchange idea with the participants. Moreover, since HKU team has set up a booth there, we met with them to share each other’s progress and further discuss our works.
A project could said to be successful only after it is testified by the experimental data and the public. Though the experimental data suggested that we might on the correct track to detect H3N2 virus, the interaction with HKU team in JSSE allowed us to figure out what to be improved further before we join the Giant Jamboree later.
School sharing session
Members shared our progress of iGEM to our schoolmates.
Sixty schoolmates attended this sharing session to understand more on DNA nanotechnology
Schoolmates listened carefully during the sharing session.
Previous Next
In October 25 morning, we held a sharing session in assembly in front of our teachers and students. Apart from briefly introduced the latest DNA nanotechnology to them, we also present our work done this summer.
School is always a well-established platform to introduce new knowledge to students. Though the knowledge in this sharing session is rather simple than what we have done this summer,  we hope that these fundamental knowledge could arouse students’ interest in nanotechnology. After all, nanotechnology is not that out of reach to the public, at least in our school.
