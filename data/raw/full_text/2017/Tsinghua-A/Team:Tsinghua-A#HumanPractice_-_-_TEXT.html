Human Practice
     The art of science should not only be limited to the scientists who are learned. We believe that everyone has the right to have a taste of the magic of science. As everyone likes playing games, we decided to integrate playing with education, thus making science more fun and less formidable. To make our game better, we had a visit to one of the biggest game company in China and received many constructive views from experts. We want the public to know more about science and love science, especially children. In order to achieve this, we held an exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum where lots of children who are interested in science visit every day. Lastly, as we want many of our peers to know more about synthetic biology and even have an interest in being an iGEMer, we held a mini-jamboree in our school. Take a look at what we have done!
visit the game company
     In order to improve our games, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd. The experts in the field of games gave us a lot of useful tips.
Holding the exhibition
     In order to publicize synthetic biology as well as iGEM, we held a three-day exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum.Our exhibition attracted a large number of people,especially children. Many people think science is really fun and cool after the exhibition.
Holding the Mini-Jamboree
     In order to attract more of our peers to the synthetic biology and iGEM, we held a mini-jamboree. We gave an introduction of synthetic biology, iGEM as well as our project. Besides, we brainstormed with them and help them have a taste of iGEM.
