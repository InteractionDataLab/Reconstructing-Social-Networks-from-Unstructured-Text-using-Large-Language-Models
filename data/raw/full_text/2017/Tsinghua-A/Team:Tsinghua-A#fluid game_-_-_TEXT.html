I Introdution
    The game “E.coli War” is designed based on our fluid model. In the game, E.coli are divided into two groups, with each group having three kinds of E.coli: warriors, farmers and beggars.
Warriors can attack the enemy
Farmers can provide food for others
Beggars just consume resources
PS：The nutrient produced by farmers can be utilized by all E.coli. It can simulate grabbing of the enemy's grain during a war.
II Rule
    There are 60,000 E.coli at the beginning of a game. They are divided equally into farmers,warriors and beggars. You and AI will get a total of 30,000 E.coli, but the distribution of each kind of E.coli is random. The game is composed of five rounds. In each round, you can allocate 6,000 E.coli .The maximal number of E.coli that your group eventually reach will be your grade. If your grade is greater than that of AI, then you win this round. If you win three rounds, then congratulations, you win the game!
    OK, Let’s Begin to learn how to play it!
    Before each game begins, You can input the number of each bacteria.
    Then you can press “Start” to begin this game.
    Now, they begin to kill each other, and the number of them is displayed at the top.(The numbers are showed logarithmically. For example, when the length is 10, the number of bacteria is 1010. If you do not want to wait for too long, you can press "Fast" to accelerate the process)
    After each round, you can click the button "OK" to play the next round or you can click the button "Quit" to exit the game.
III Game strategy
    Although we cannot figure out exactly how the initial numbers determine the result, we do find out some rules. Here are some of them and hope that they can help you to win.
    Because farmers provide nutrients for both sides, they have no effect in each side in terms of nutrients. Farmers only play a role in counting the total number of bacteria. Take this into consideration when you are placing farmers.
    Warriors can attack enemy, which is beneficial for their own side.  When the number of our warriors is bigger than AI's, and the number of our beggars is less than AI's, we will be more likely to win. The mechanism of winning is that our bacteria will keep growing faster.
    Because beggars do not have any production, they grow the fastest. When the number of warriors of both sides is closer and the number of our beggars is bigger than AI's, we will be more likely to win. The mechanism of winning is that the number of our beggars will be far greater than AI's.
