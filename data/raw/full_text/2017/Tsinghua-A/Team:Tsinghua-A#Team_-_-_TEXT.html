Fig.1 group photo
    Hi, guys! We are Tsinghua-A Team from Tsinghua University , Beijing. Our team includes 12 wise and diligent team members from the Department of Life Science as well as the Department of Automation. This year, our project “The E.coli War” contains a lot of fancy ideas. We believe our work will make you amazing!     We work together and chart together. We are not only teammates, but also best friends in our school life! We also have done lots of efforts to promote synthetic biology as well as IGEM. Have a look at our wiki to know more about us!
Fig.2 There are three roles we have designed on the back of the dress
Li Shuailin
My name is Li Shuailin from Tsinghua University, majoring in Life Science. In our IGEM project, I am responsible for the design of gene circuit, Orthogonality test. Also, I am involved in the construction of the fluid model, which helps us regulate the killing ability of the warrior. I enjoy the process of hypothesis and demonstration.Besides, I love doing experiment and thinking with the help of math!
He Wanlin
I am He Wanlin, a junior from Tsinghua University, majoring in Life Science. I am mainly responsible for the construction and testing of different parts as well as experimental designing. During my lab time with E.coli, I gradually become familiar with their favors and temper. Our experiments are really cool as we are building marvelous tools with E.coli!
Wang Chenghao
My name is Wang Chenghao. I study biology in the School of Life Science and I am a junior. I am a typical north-easterner in China, with an impressive height and an upright character. That’s why I received a nickname, Mr. Two Meters. Talking of my work in our project, I undertook the job of designing and assembling the genetic circuit of the farmer with another teammates. Besides, I also took charge of the test of the warrior’s attack.
Zhu Rongping
My name is Zhu Rongping,I am funny and somewhat outgoing, and I have great interests in programming, science and animation. I’d like to try everything new to me because of my curiosity. I made an effort to implement the game for fluid medium.
Tang Ruixiang
I‘m from the department of Automation. In the program I major in code. I design a web game that use our model. So I want every player to know about our program after playing the game.
Zhang Chi
I come from the school of Life Science. I'm involved in doing experiment, especially creating a new part in our teamwork. In addition, I'm crazy about working out in the gym.
Wang Zhaojian
Nihao! Here if you don't get embarrassed by someone who would describe themselves in the following way, I would like to define myself as a sun shine boy hahaha. I am Wang Zhaojian, from School of Life Science, Tsinghua and currently I am on my pre-med track before going to medical school. In this team I am the student leader basically get involved in everything from lab open bench work, team logo and cartoon design, human practice planning to wiki editing. My motto is "When you stop learning, you start dying." I always get energized by trying new things and meeting interesting people, see you in the Jamboree soon!
Kang Zifeng
My name is Kang Zifeng, a junior from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. I contribute to modeling and programming work in Tsinghua-A team, and AI algorithms because I'm interested in machine learning technology. In my spare time , I often do exercise such as long-run and ball games, or hang out with my iGEM teammates. Hope our project will be a big success!
Li Siting
I'm Li Siting, major in Automation. With the love for both programming and biology, I developed the online E.coli War game in JavaScript. Then I came up with the idea of analogizing our game about bacteria’s competition to the typical history events. I drafted the descriptions and designed pictures for our game and discovery on wiki. As I am good at writing, I wrote our visiting plan for a company, presentation advertisement and designed an exhibition board for science museum. With the crazy love for softball, I want to say playing softball helps me to be very energetic and proactive. Photography is also my hobby.
Gang Qiang
My name is Gang Qiang. I am from Tsinghua University and major in Automation, which contains knowledge of many different subjects. In this team, I am mainly responsible for wiki. I am open-minded and fond of many kinds of sports, especially soccer. In my spare time, I like watching films , traveling or having a soccer game with friends.
Chen Yixin
I'm Chen Yixin from Tsinghua University, majoring in Automation. I am responsible for the Wiki and also involved in model. I'm interested in programming and also keen on the colorful biology world. In my spare time, I love playing video games and reading novels.
