I.Introduction
In solid media, things are not so easy as it is in the liquid media. In this case, the bacteria are not mixed at once. Besides, we have to consider the influence of the initial position of each bacterium. Like the situation in liquid media, now for solid media, we still have three characters, the farmers, the warriors and the beggars. And the cute bacteria still face the severe war against another battalion. Now let us learn more about them.
Farmers are aimed to produce resources for all the bacteria. In our experiment, the ‘farmer’ bacteria can generate glucose; while in our online game, they can produce food for others to make their lives. But be careful, your farmer’s food can also be eaten by the enemies so you need to take care of where to initialize them.
Warriors’ skill is to kill enemies. No matter what the enemy is, your brave warriors can kill both farmers and beggars from the enemy troop and can fight against your enemy’s warriors as soon as they meet. But these little combatants can’t make a living without the food from farmers so you have to initialize them within the nutrition range around farmers.
Beggars are so lazy that they just sit around doing nothing. They don’t produce food so they have to rely on farmers. Also, they are not part of the military force so they kill ‘nobody’.
II.Rule
The following is our main menu for game pattern. By choosing ‘One Player’ you can play with the virtual player AI (artificial intelligence). We have designed smart algorithm to help you computer think up game strategies like human do and AI can initialize its bacteria after your action at once. If you choose ‘Two Players’, then you can play with your friends or initialize both sides yourself.
Each battalion has the same amount of bacteria.You can initialize your bacterial camp at the beginning of the game before you click the button ’start’.

By click on different bacteria characters you can initialize them on the round Petri dishes. Different colors represent different kind of bacteria and the green box around the farmers surround the area of nutrition they can support so don’t put your bacteria out of green boxes.
The number following ‘total’ tell us the amount of live bacteria in each bacteria troop. At the bottom of the picture we can see the ‘remaining chances’ we have to initialize bacteria. The days which bacteria have growing for and the coordinate point of where you mouse click are at the upper right corner.
Now we can learn more about the toolbar.
After you finish initializing all the bacteria, clicking the ‘start’ button can run the game. If you click on the button ‘restart’, all of the all the progress can be cleared. By clicking the button ‘model’, you can choose again whether you want to play with AI or not. Now let us click the button ‘setting’ and we can see the following pop-up:
The first option line is for setting background music volume. The middle line decides the volume of bacteria actor's lines and after you click on each character, you can hear them speaking. By dragging the last line’s option button you can change the amount of bacteria of each side.
