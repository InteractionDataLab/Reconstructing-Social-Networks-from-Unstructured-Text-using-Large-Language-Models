These 13 parts can be divided into three groups. Two of them BBa_K2513000 and BBa_K2513001 belong to the promoter group which are designed to be tested of their promoter functions in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. The BBa_K2513002 and BBa_K2513003 are the homologous recombination arms that will help the target genes to be integrated into genome. And the others belong to the group that encode different proteins, like BBa_K2513020 encodes a starch synthesis enzyme, BBa_K2513021 encodes the two subunits of Rubisco, BBa_K2513031 encode the SmtA gene from Synechococcus sp.PCC7942, BBa_K2513032 encode the FBPA gene from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
