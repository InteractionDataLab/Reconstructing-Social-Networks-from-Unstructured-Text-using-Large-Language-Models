Human Practice Silver
In order to figure out a great research project, we did team brain storming several times under guidance of Professor Zhang and Dr. Dong. Team had got several interesting directions, such as air pollution detector for PM2.5, water pollution detector for eutrophication, clear energy solution - bio-hydrogen production, new treatment on malignant tumor, and etc. Finally, a fantastic idea caught eyes of most person in the team, which would challenge one of the biggest concerns of human being – global warming.
It is well know that the effects of global warming are the environmental and social changes caused (directly or indirectly) by human emissions of greenhouse gases, i.e. CO2. It may cause a series of serious problems, both in physical system, such as sea level raising or extreme weather, and social system, food supplier, for instance. Therefore, we were planning to build an efficacy carbon fixation system to converse superfluous inorganic carbon (carbon dioxide) in atmosphere to organic compounds by living organisms, so as to reduce the greenhouse effect. For purpose of making the research proposal serious, besides the literature research, we decided to investigate the public attitude by survey as well as interview some experts for their professional sight.
To gain professional insight about climate change and more, we set out to talk to important figures in China. To begin with, Mr. Qifeng Zhao, Founder of Carbonmeasure, helped us understand current china situation involving new aspects like carbon tax and carbon trading. Besides Zhao, we had a conversation on Mr. Jinghang Ji, curator of Hangzhou Low Carbon Science & Technology Museum (which is the ONE and ONLY museum focusing on low carbon in China even worldwide). It was him who told us great deal on current situation and prospects of China’s effort fighting global warming, and further enlightened us on our project in choosing organisms and gave us perspective in what we should focus in education part of human practice. Moreover, we corresponded with several prestige scholars & researchers (who also offered their sincere help throughout our project) through emails or face-to-face meeting, learning more about safety and ethics about biological experiments. For more details, see Integrated Human Practice page.
Based on the results of public survey and suggestion of experts, we had held a serious of activities on education and public engagement as our main human practice direction, including information session in high schools and Zhejiang University, public events in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum, and etc. The detail information could be found on the Education and Public Engagement page.
