INP-FBPA
BBa_K2513034
INP-FBPA
This part encodes a fusion protein that composed of INP and FBPA and designed to be expressed at the surface of E.coli or Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. We replaced the 6His tag of INP-6His (BBa_K2509019) with a ferric iron binding protein FBPA (BBa_K2513032)to build this part.
BBa_K2509019 and BBa_K2513032
We directly replaced the 6His tag with FBPA without being deleted its stop codon to make a C-fusion protein. So that the whole part can only be transferred as a fusion protein with N part of INP and FBPA.
