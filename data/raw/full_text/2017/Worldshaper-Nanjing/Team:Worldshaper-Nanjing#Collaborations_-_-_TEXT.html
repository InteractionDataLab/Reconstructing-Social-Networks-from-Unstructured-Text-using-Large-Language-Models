Collaborations
We believe that our experience in iGEM should go beyond our own projects to learn more from others and disseminate our ideas. Having received some generous help from other iGEM teams, we figured that we should also try our best to give a helping hand to those teams in need. Here in the Collaborations page, you will see the highlights of our interactions with other teams.
With Worldshaper-XSHS/Worldshaper-Wuhan/ASTWS-China
We were very lucky to work with these amazing teams to spread our ideas and engage with public in Zhejiang Science&Technology Museums. We successfully induced attention from public and evoked children’s interest in biology and biochemistry by performing some eye catching experiments in front of them. Our efforts were even on some local magazines after the successful event.

With Team Worldshaper-XSHS
During our interlab study, we encountered difficulty attempting to extract enough DNA from the distribution kit plates to transform our competent cells. We have tried to optimize the standard transformation protocols by pipetting more diluted DNA into the competent cell culture and centrifuging the plate in order to promote further dilution, but still transformed cell colonies can hardly be obtained. Consequently, we suspected that the DNA plate could be contaminated or corrupted.
Under this circumstance, we reached out to several other iGEM 2017 teams nearby for help with the transformation. Eventually we got in touch Worldshaper-XSHS  which was willing to help us by providing transformed cells and hoped to use the plate reader in our lab for data collection.

With Team UCAS
To create more sparkles with other minds in our iGEM experience, we decided to help those in need. When browsing iGEM China Community forum on QQ, we found that Team UCAS posted for help to run some tests, prove the correctness of their protocol, and to find out relationship between expression rate and ammonium gradient.
