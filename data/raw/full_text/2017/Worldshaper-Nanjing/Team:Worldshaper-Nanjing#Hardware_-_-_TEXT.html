Here, we developed a new device for algae cultivation. Compared to the flask culture method, it has some obvious advantages: less cost, more biomass and more efficiency of space usage. Moreover, it’s easier to scale up from lab to factory.
This device consists of three parts. The first part is the glass tube which functions as a container for cultivation (see Fig. 1). The tube on left hand is the container version 1.0, 60cm high and 3 cm of diameter; and the right hand tube is the container version 2.0, 80cm high and 5cm of diameter, which has obviously larger volume and provides higher culture efficiency than the former. The second part is an air pump with a filter at its air inlet (see Fig.2) for preventing microorganism contamination. The air pump pumps air bubbles continuously from the bottom of the tube (see the video below) in order to increase the dissolved air and the biomass. The air bubbles can prevent the algae cells from settlement and make the culture conditions more homogeneously. The last important part is composed of multiple light tubes (see Fig.3) controlled by an automatic switch module, and this part functions as a light supplier.
