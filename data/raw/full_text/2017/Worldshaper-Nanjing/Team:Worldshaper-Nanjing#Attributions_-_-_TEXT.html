Attributions
Attribution is an important part for any IGEM project. Therefore, we will include which people is responsible for which part and who supported us in the attribution. The Wet lab is responsible for the whole process of the experiment which includes the design, the operation, and the record of the experiment. The others responsible for the data analyze, wiki, human practice, and presentation. Team members could have few different jobs if they are interested in. On the other hand, we are very fortunate to have many teachers, advisors, experts help us throughout the project and human practice. Here, we would like to offer our sincere thanks to every dedicated member and those supported us along our way.
