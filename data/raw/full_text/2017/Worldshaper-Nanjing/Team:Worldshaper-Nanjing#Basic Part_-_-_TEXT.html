FBPA for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
BBa_K2513032
FBPA for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
This is an improved version of BBa_K1122702 which encodes a protein capable of binding ferric iron. We optimized its coding sequence according to the favorite codon usage frequency of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Further we added NcoI and BamHI sites at 5 prime end, and added HindIII and BglII sites at 3 prime end. It could be easily fused with INP or SomA which are well verified proteins that used in surface-display in E.coli and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, so that the FBPA could be also expressed at the surface of E.coli or Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.
FBPA is from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The whole parts is synthesized by GenScript Corporation.
Because of the special bias of codon usage of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, it was necessary to do a codon optimization of FBPA. And in order to express this ferric ion binding protein at the surface of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, this part was designed to be fused with other outer membrane proteins like INP or SomA with or without stop codon and with unique restriction sites of BamHI and HindIII at the two sides.
cpcBA promoter
BBa_K2513032
cpcBA promoter
This basic part was designed to be ligated into a basic vector pAQ1Basic3 to make an expression vector pAQ1J2 and functioned as a promoter to driver transcription of the target genes downstream. The cpcBA promoter is originally from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and also works well in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002.
The sequence is from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and synthesized by GenScript Corporation.
This promoter region can be easily replace by others by digestion with KpnI and NdeI restriction enzymes. So we can easily compare and measure different promoters in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 when inserting a reporter gene like EGFP.
GlgA2
BBa_K2513020
GlgA2
This part encodes a protein GlgA2 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that involved in the pathway glycogen biosynthesis, which is part of glycan biosynthesis. We want to increase the starch accumulation of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 by transferring this gene.
The amino acid sequence is according to the GlgA2 gene of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and the DNA fragment is synthesized by GenScript Corporation.
SmtA-out
BBa_K2513031
SmtA-out
This encodes a protein SmtA from Synechococcus sp.PCC7942 which may play a role in essential metal ion homeostasis (especially zinc homeostasis) and resistance to certain non-essential metal ions. Metallothioneins have a high content of cysteine residues that bind various heavy metals. It was designed to be fused with INP or SomA which are well verified proteins that used in surface-display in E.coli and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, so that it can be also expressed at the surface of E.coli or Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 to help the transgenetic hosts to absorbing metal irons.
This part can be easily fused with other outer membrane proteins like INP or SomA with or without stop codon using unique restriction sites of BamHI and HindIII at the two sides.
The amino sequence is according to the SmtA gene of Synechococcus sp.PCC7942, and DNA fragment is synthesized by GenScript Corporation.
