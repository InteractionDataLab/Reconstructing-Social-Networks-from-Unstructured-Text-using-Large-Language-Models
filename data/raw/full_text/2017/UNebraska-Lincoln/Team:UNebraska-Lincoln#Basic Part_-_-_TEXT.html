Vanadium-Dependent Bromoperoxidase (BBa_k2461002):
Vanadium dependent bromoperoxidase is a kind of haloperoxidase that is involved in the bromination of organic halo-compounds associated with defense and pigmentation in seaweeds and marine algae. The active site features a vanadium oxide center attached to the protein via one histidine side chain and a collection of hydrogen bonds to the oxide ligands. The enzyme can use many different hydrocarbon substrates to catalyse the oxidation of bromide by hydrogen peroxide. The resulting electrophilic bromonium cation (Br+) attacks hydrocarbons. This gene was utilized in our composite part (BBa_k2461000) for its ability to create bromoform which has been proven to reduce methane in cattle as described in full HERE .
NrfA (BBa_k2461001):
This gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the reduction of nitrite to ammonia without releasing intermediate products. This catalytic reaction occurs within the periplasmic space of gram-negative bacteria. Either hydrogen, formate, or sulfide can be used as an electron donor. This part was used in conjunction with (BBa_K2461003) to reduce nitrite to ammonia within the rumen of cattle. More information can be found HERE .
NrfH (BBa_k2461003):
This gene encodes an enzyme subunit for cytochrome c552. It acts as an inner membrane anchor for the partnering unit and helps mediate electron transport. Cytochrome c552's ability would be impaired without this subunit. This part was used in conjunction with (BBa_K2461001) to reduce nitrite to ammonia within the rumen of cattle.
