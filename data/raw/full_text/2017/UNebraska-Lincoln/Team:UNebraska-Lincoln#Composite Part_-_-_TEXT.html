Composite Parts
Composite bromoperoxidase (BBa_k2461000):
This part is a composite part made with the constitutive promoter BBa_j23119, the ribosome binding site BBa_j61100, the gene that codes for a Vanadium-Dependent bromoperoxidase enzyme, and the commonly used terminator BBa_B0015. This part was designed to produce bromoform inside the rumen of cattle. Bromoform has been proven to reduce methane emissions, but it is usually delivered using seaweed to indirectly change the microbiome of the cattle. The UNebraska-Lincoln iGEM team decided to use this part to directly change the microbiome of the cattle. More information can be found HERE .
nrfHA composite (BBa_k2461004):
This gene encodes both Cytochrome c552 (nrfA) and Cytochrome c small subunit (nrfH). The part includes the constitutive promoter J23100, the medium strength ribosome binding site B0032 before each coding sequence, and the double terminator B0015. This part was designed to convert nitrite into ammonia within the rumen of cattle. More information can be found HERE .
