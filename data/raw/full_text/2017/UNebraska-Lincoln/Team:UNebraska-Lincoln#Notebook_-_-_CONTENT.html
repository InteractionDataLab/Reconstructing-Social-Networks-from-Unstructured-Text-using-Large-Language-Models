We started our visits to a local museum and set up a booth with information on global warming and our iGEM project. We had a few skype calls with other iGEM teams from Pakistan, Mexico and Boston, to talk about our projects and possible collaborations.</P></SECTION><H2 class="leap">Week 5</H2><SECTION class="noteSec"><P>Nic and Tyler prepared the plasmid pSB1C3 by culturing and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Experiments" target="_blank">miniprep-ing</A> to isolate the plasmid. The plasmid was digested at the XbaI and SpeI sites in preparation for SLIC ligation. <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Experiments" target="_blank">SLIC</A> was performed after the three gene inserts were cut at the same positions.

PCR on the gene blocks was tried anyway in preparation for sequencing.

The team learned from sequencing that A was possibly correct so we set it aside for further sequencing. B and H were likely incorrect so we went through steps to perform <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Experiments" target="_blank">SLIC</A> again. Nic digested the B and H vectors and Jessica digested the RFP to make an empty vector. After that Nic performed the SLIC procedure and then transformed our newly cloned B and H plasmids while Jessica learned how to do protein purifications and western blots. This week Jessica also performed <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNebraska-Lincoln/Experiments" target="_blank">colony PCR</A> on the newly cloned B colonies.
