Record the decrease in A290nm for several more minutes. Obtain the A290nm/minute using the maximum linear rate for both the samples and controls.
NOTE= This procedure was adapted from a sigma aldrich protocol. (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/General_Information/2/bromoperoxidase.pdf) We used a microplate reader instead of cuvettes and a spectrophotometer to measure change in absorbance. Because of this 400 µL total instead of 1 mL total. Ratios of reagents are the same just modified to be 400 µL total volume.

›Nitrite Metabolism Testing Procedure
Note: In order to simplify the procedure, the symbol N will be used to designate the total number of samples being tested. For example, if five different nitrite concentrations are being tested, N for that experiment would be 12, because there would be five samples containing the various concentrations for both the control and experimental cultures, along with a 0 mmol samples for both cultures. For clarity see Table 1 below:
Materials
Day 1
Solid NaNO2 (Total required mass is calculated for experiment conditions)
150 mL Erlenmeyer Flask
50 mL Graduated Cylinder
LB Media
20% Aqueous Glucose
Serum Vials, Rubber Stoppers, and Metal Caps
Serum Vial Crimper
Nitrogen Source and Tube
1 mL Syringe Needles
Ring Stand, Clamps
Four Culture Tubes
Chloramphenicol (1 ug/mg)
Day 2
96 Well Plate
Chloramphenicol  (1 ug/mg)
Syringes and Needles
Day 3
Syringes
Nessler’s Reagent
Procedure
Day 1
Nitrite Solution Preparation
In separate eppendorf tubes, prepare 100 µL of sodium nitrite solution for each concentration that will be tested in the experiment. The final volume of each anaerobic culture, including the added nitrite solution, will be 10.6 mL.
Vial Preparation
In a 150 mL Erlenmeyer flask, combine 146.25 mL of LB media with 3.75 mL of 20% aqueous glucose in sterile conditions. LB media can be measured using a 50 mL graduated cylinder.
Obtain N of each of serum vials, rubber stoppers, and metal caps
Transfer 10 mL of the previously prepared culture into each vial, along with 100µL of the corresponding nitrite solution.
Seal each vial with a rubber stopper.
Using a vial crimper, crimp a metal cap onto each vial in order to seal the vials shut. Make sure to label this cap to keep track of the nitrite concentration present.
Dispose of the remaining media in the Erlenmeyer flask accordingly.
Sparging
Obtain two 1 mL syringe needles, a ring stand, and two clamps. The syringes themselves are not necessary, only the needles.
Fix one clamp onto the ring stand towards the base. Put a serum vial in the gripping end of the clamp and tighten. Make sure the base of the vial is resting on the base of the stand.
Mount the other clamp higher on the ring stand. This will hold the nitrogen tube.
Attach one of the syringe needles to a nitrogen line. This attachment will vary depending on the nitrogen source setup present in each lab.
Use the other syringe needle to vent the serum vial. This needle is perforated through the rubber stopper. DO NOT PUT THE TIP OF THIS NEEDLE INTO THE MEDIA PRESENT IN THE VIAL. This will lead to expulsion of media from the vial onto the surroundings.
The serum vial is now vented and securely mounted to the table, and a syringe needle is attached to the nitrogen tube. Slowly begin to turn on the nitrogen source until the desired flow rate is reached. Very little flow is required for sparging. After the desired flow is reached, push the nitrogen needle into the vial. Put this tip as far into the liquid as possible so it will bubble through the media. Adjust flow as necessary until a steady stream of bubbles is present.
Each vial needs to be sparged for ten minutes. At the end of each sparging, remove the nitrogen source needle first, and then the vent needle. When starting a new vial, insert the vent needle before the nitrogen needle.
After all vials have been sparged, shut off the nitrogen supply, dispose of the needles in the sharps container, and disassemble the rest of the setup.
After sparging, autoclave the vials using the liquid cycle to ensure any potential contaminants are destroyed.
Creating Aerobic Cultures
Obtain four culture tubes for this portion of the experiment.
In sterile conditions, add 5 mL of LB media with 5 uL of chloramphenicol (1 µg/mg).
The first two tubes are both for control cultures. Transfer a single colony from a culture plate into each tube, again in sterile conditions.
Repeat the previous step for the experimental cultures.
Incubate these cultures overnight in a 37℃ shaker incubator.
Day 2
Optical Density of Aerobic Cultures
Obtain an OD reading for all four aerobic cultures. Blank with water. A 10:1 dilution is recommended, but other dilution factors are acceptable as long as performed consistently.
Select the control and experimental cultures with the higher OD reading to perform the rest of the experiment.
Creating Anaerobic Cultures
Obtain the control and experimental aerobic culture tubes with the higher OD reading. Add 5.6 µL of chloramphenicol antibiotic to each.
Obtain N syringes and syringe needles.
Syringe 0.5 mL of culture into each vial using a different syringe for each vial. Make sure to add the correct culture in the correct vial (control vs experimental).
Incubate the vials overnight in the 37℃ shaker incubator.
Day 3
Optical Density of Anaerobic Cultures
Obtain N Eppendorf tubes.
Extract approximately 1.2 mL of each aerobic culture using a different syringe. Put each of these samples into a separate Eppendorf tube.
From each Eppendorf tube, pipet 20 µL of culture into the desired well plate. Perform OD reading in the same fashion as the aerobic cultures.
Isolation of Supernatant
Centrifuge the Eppendorf tubes made in the previous section at approximately 20000 g for three minutes.
Pre-weigh N new large Eppendorf tubes.
Transfer 1 mL of supernatant from each sample into the corresponding pre-weighed Eppendorf tube. Discard the remaining supernatant and pellet in a biohazard waste container.
Nessler’s Test
0.5 mL of Nessler’s Reagent is required for each supernatant sample. Obtain an adequate amount (0.5 mL * N) of reagent in a disposable culture tube.
Add 0.5 mL of the reagent into each supernatant sample tube. Close the lid and invert 5x for each sample to ensure complete reaction of the reagent with the ammonia present in the sample.
Centrifuge the samples at approximately 20000 g for 10 minutes.
After centrifuge, remove as much supernatant as possible from each sample using a separate pipet tip and discard in a heavy-metal waste container. Be careful to not remove any precipitate.
Centrifuge again highest rpm for 10 minutes.
Again, remove any remaining supernatant using a separate pipet tip for each sample and dispose in the heavy metal waste container.
Weigh each sample and subtract the initial mass of the pre-weighed Eppendorf tube. Leave in the fume hood for 24 hours, and re-weigh. Continue to re-weigh every 24 hours until the masses stabilize. Record the final stabilized masses and subtract the initial corresponding container masses.
Using proper technique, clean up any waste in the appropriate manner. Ensure that all items that came into contact with Nessler’s reagent are disposed of in a heavy metals waste container.
