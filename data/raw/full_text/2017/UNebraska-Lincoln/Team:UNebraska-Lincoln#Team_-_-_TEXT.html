MEET THE TEAM
Members:
Crystal Xu
Crystal is currently a junior at Lincoln East high school. She enjoys traveling with friends and family, eating desserts, and running cross country and track. One day she hopes to become a great surgeon.
Alexis Krepps
Alexis is a rising senior studying biomedical engineering. Her Myers-Briggs personality is ESFJ and plans to go into biomedical device sales career after graduation. She can also quote Sweet Home Alabama better than you and all your friends. Currently, she is seeking the best promo codes for life and elevating small talk to medium talk.
Jessica Harms
Jessica is going to be a second year chemical engineering major. Even though she spent most of highschool playing snare drum for competitive drumlines in the omaha/metro area her true passion is science. Other interests include crocheting, Mario Kart and hiking.
Nicholas Flaxbeard
Nick is going to be a senior in chemical engineering this upcoming school year. He also plays professional jazz piano in the Omaha/Lincoln area. He hopes to work in the research industry, and potentially pursue a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering as well.
Logan Uhlir
Logan is a sophomore computer engineering major from western Nebraska who hopes to use his future degree in a biological setting. Logan enjoys listening to music, running, and learning new things.
Tyler Barker
Tyler is a Junior Computer Engineering undergraduate who plans to get his masters in Computer Engineering or Computer Science. Tyler hopes to better the computer science field and help the public to better understand how they work. Tyler can tie his shoes most days of the week.
Nic Kite
Nic will be entering his junior year as a Biochemistry major. He grew up in a small town and enjoys the rural life. Nic wishes to continue pursuing genetic engineering research after his time with iGEM.
Advisors:
Danny Dooling
Danny is a senior Chemistry and Microbiology major, planning on attending medical school. By day, Danny is a Chemistry and Biology TA. By night, he is an active connoisseur of Chinese food and a pug enthusiast.
Colton Harper
Colton is a junior pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. He plans to attend graduate school and then secure a position in academia. His research interests are in molecular communication, information theory, and synthetic biology. Colton’s favorite onomatopoeia is “Whoup-a chyah”.
Professors:
Massimiliano Pierobon
Massimiliano Pierobon is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Dr. Pierobon holds also a courtesy appointment at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, effective from September 2014. Dr. Pierobon received the Master of Science (B.S.+M.S.) degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2005.
Jiantao Guo
Dr. Guo received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Organic Chemistry from Nankai University with Professor Jin-Pei Cheng, and his Ph.D. degree from Michigan State University with Professor John W. Frost. He pursued postdoctoral studies with Professor Peter G. Schultz at The Scripps Research Institute before joining the University of Nebraska – Lincoln, Department of Chemistry as an Assistant Professor in 2010.
Myra Cohen
Myra Cohen is a Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  She is a member of the ESQuaReD software engineering research group.  She received her Ph.D. from the University of Auckland, New Zealand and her M.S. from the University of Vermont.  She is the recipient of both a National Science Foundation Early CAREER award and an Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Award. Her research interests are in software testing of configurable systems, search-based software engineering and applications of software testing techniques to biological systems engineering.
Wei Niu
Dr. Wei Niu is a Synthetic Biologist and an Assistant Professor in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her research focuses on the metabolic engineering principles that are used for biological microbial-synthesis of industrial additive chemicals from sustainable feedstocks, which also entails the development of enzymes and auxiliary proteins that are used to develop pharmaceutical and other energy-applied molecules.
Instructors:
Cheryl Immethun
Cheryl focuses on engineering microbes’ vast biochemical capabilities to address societal needs. Her expertise is photosynthetic bacteria, which use light and carbon dioxide to make a number of different products sustainably. Her passions include solving puzzles (in and out of the lab,) as well as exciting students about the mysteries of science and helping them develop the tools to become society’s problem solvers.
Erome Hankore
Erome is from Ethiopia in East Africa. She enjoys Gospel music and likes to sing. She is currently pursuing a Ph.D degree from the chemistry department at UNL under the chemical biology division. She likes teaching and hopes to pursue a career in academia.
Jaroslaw A. Pankowski
Jaroslaw is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at UNL’s Chemistry department. He specializes in molecular microbiology and bacterial genetics. His research interests are focused on artificial genetic circuits and application of synthetic biology concepts.
