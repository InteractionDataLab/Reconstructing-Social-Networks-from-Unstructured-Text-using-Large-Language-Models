Our team participated in the Plate Reader Interlab Study . In addition, we attempted to characterize the 2015 IIT Delhi teamâ€™s nitrite reductase gene sequence. We chose this part because this enzyme formed the basis of our own nitrite reductase composite part. Unfortunately, due to deletions within the coding sequence during the cloning process our efforts to further characterize the Delhi iGEM team's part were halted.
