Safety
Lab Access And Rules
1
We wear aprons, goggles, gloves as required when doing experiment.
2
No eating nor drinking at workspace
3
Wearing mask when it comes to the experiment of testing the activity of NOR.
Responsible individual
1
Xinai Chen, the worker responsible for lab safety, teaching us about the appropriate use of necessary chemical compounds necessary to our experiments.
2
Qingting Bo, phD, instructing us about steps in biology experiments such as PCR.
Differences between biosafety level
BSL1
Mechanical pipetting only (no mouth pipetting allowed)
Safe sharps handling
Avoidance of splashes or aerosols
aily decontamination of all work surfaces when work is complete
Hand washing
Prohibition of food, drinks and smoking materials in lab setting
Personal protective equipment, such as; eye protection, gloves and a lab coat or gown
Biohazard signs
Using universal microbes: $E.coli$ to extract enzymes.
BSL2
Eye protection and face shields can also be worn, as needed: wearing gas mask when preforming experiment related to NO and NO2
The laboratory has self-closing, lockable doors.
A sink and eyewash station should be readily available.
Biohazard warning signs: note the poisonous chemical compound: methyl vionlogen, placing this compound elsewhere.
Sustained directional airflow to draw air into the laboratory from clean areas towards potentially contaminated areas. Lab Access And Rules:
We wear aprons, goggles, gloves as required when doing experiment.
No eating nor drinking at workspace
Wearing mask when it comes to the experiment of testing the activity of nor

Good microbial techniques
1
aseptic techniques ( using CHL, AMP when performing microbes experiment)
2
Handled organisms from contaminating the laboratory
3
Organisms in a laboratory environment from contaminating the work.
Disinfection and sterilization
1
Contain the microbes in a controlled bioreactor, to prevent the $E.coli$ from contaminating the environment
2
Choose the universal microbes: $E.coli$ as the producer of designed enzymes
Emergency procedures
1
Eyewash station
2
Immediate shower system nearby
3
Fire extinguisher in the lab
Transport rules
1
Use sealed tubes and test-tube rack when transporting products
2
Use tight gas cylinder when transporting products.
Chemicals, Fire and Electrical Safety
1
Fire extinguisher in lab
2
Wear gloves and goggles when dilute corrosive chemical compound, such as potassium permanganate, dense sulfuric acid
3
Use direction airflow system when performing experiment related to NO and NO2
4
Keep aware when performing electrophoresis
