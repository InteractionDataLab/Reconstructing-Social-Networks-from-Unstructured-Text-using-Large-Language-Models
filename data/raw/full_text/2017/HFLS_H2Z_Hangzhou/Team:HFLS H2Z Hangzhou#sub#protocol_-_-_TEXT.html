8-10 µL DNA ladder
DNA loading dye
Methods:
1
Prepare 8% w/v solution of agarose powder in 1/10 TAE buffer (e.g. 0.8g agarose powder in 100 mL buffer) using a conical flask.
2
Heat the mixture until agarose is completely dissolved. Do not let the solution boil.
3
Pour the solution into a gel mould.
4

5
Allows the solution to set (approx 15-20 minutes).
6
Transfer the agarose gel to a tank, remove the comb and apply:
8-10 µL of the DNA ladder
DNA samples with the corresponding amount of DNA loading dye.
7
Run the gel for 30-45 minutes at 100V.
Ligation
Materials:
Microcentrifuge tube
Ice
1 µL T4 DNA ligase
1 µL 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer
3 µL vector plasmid
5 µL insert DNA (the ratio of plasmid and DNA should be modified according to the concentration of the DNA)
Sterile water
Methods:
1
Add vector plasmid, insert DNA, T4 DNA ligase and T4 DNA ligase buffer to the microcentrifuge tube on ice (add T4 DNA ligase last).
2
Make reaction up to 10 µL using sterile water.
3
Flick the tube 4-5 times to mix.
4
Incubate at 16°C for at least 30 - 60 min for sticky ends or 1-2 hours for blunt ends.
Restriction Digestion
Materials:
