Jianan Li
Hi, this is Jianan, you can also call me Canal :) I am a big fan of everything engineered, main reason why I am here. I am in love with art, anime, 3A title game and traveling. In the team, I am in charge of planning and molecular biology related experiments. Actually I have a shaky hand and often spill over samples, so maybe next year we can think of some project to deal with that!
My favorite game is Portal and favorite anime is ‘Your Lie In April'
