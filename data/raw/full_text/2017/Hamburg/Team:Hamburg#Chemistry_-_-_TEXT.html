Pyochelin Synthesis
The synthesis of pyochelin was carried out in six steps. Two viable routes were found in the literature. The first step, however, which is the reaction between 2-hydroxybenzonitrile with L-cysteine is equal for both routes. The first route that was tried out, was a esterification of the product with methanol, followed by the reduction of the product with diisobutylaluminium hydride to yield the corresponding aldehyde. The reaction was unsuccessful. The other method describes the synthesis of the aldehyde using an activator for the carboxylic acid (from the first step) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine to yield the Weinreb-amide, which in turn was reduced with lithium alumanuide to yield the desired corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde was then condensed with N-methylcysteine to yield the pyochelin. Due to poor commercial availability, N-methylcysteine had to be synthesized from N-Boc-S-trityl-L-cysteine. The protected cysteine was methylated with sodium hydride/methyl iodide and the protecting groups removed with trifluoroacetic acid.
Gallium and iron complexes with pyochelin serving as the ligands were formed by combining dissolved pyochelin with dissolved metal salts. UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation of the complexes. The resulting spectra can be seen in the figures a (free ligand and both complexes for comparison), b (pyochelin and the formation of the iron complex) and c (pyochelin and the formation of the gallium complex).
Fig. a: UV-Vis spetrum of pyochelin and complexes with iron or gallium.
Fig. b: UV-Vis spetrum of pyochelin and of pyochelin after adding iron(III) chloride recorded at certain times.
Fig. c: UV-Vis spetrum of pyochelin and pyochelin after adding gallium(III) nitrate recorded at certain times.
The formation of what is presumed to be complexes is clearly visible in both spectra. Absorption maxima are shifting towards higher wavelengths. Note the very quick formation of the iron complex, and the rather slow gallium complex formation.
Note: many of the syntheses have been carried out multiple times.

Attempt to synthesize 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxylic acid (1)
The reaction has been carried out under inert atmosphere and with dry solvents.
5.987 g of 2-cyanophenol and 7.997 g of L-cysteine hydrochloride were dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol.  4.200 g of sodium bicarbonate were then added. The mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes. The pH was adjusted to 9 with piperidine after the mixture cooled down. The mixture was stirred for 12 h at room temperature. 11.0 mL of hot water were added and the mixture was acidified to a pH of 4 using acetic acid. The precipitate was then washed with cold water and ethanol. Residual solvents were removed under high vacuum.
The washings were acidified again with more acetic acid, which caused more product to precipitate. The workup proceeded as described above.
The product was neither soluble in CDCl3 nor in deuterium oxide, so no NMR spectrum was recorded.
IR-spectroscopy showed a band at 2460 cm -1. This indicates the presence of a free -SH group, which does not belong to the desired product.
Synthesis of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxylic acid (2)
3.000 g of 2-cyanophenol and 8.850 g of L-cysteine were dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and PBS (0.1 M, pH = 6.4). The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.5 with solid potassium carbonate. The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 15 h. After cooling down, the solvents were removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in 150 mL of water. The pH was adjusted to 2.0 by addition of solid citric acid. 100 mL of DCM were added to the flask. The layers were allowed to separate. The aqueous layer was extracted three times with 100 mL of DCM. The organic layers were pooled and washed with brine. DCM was removed in vacuo.

The solution was cooled down to -78 °C. 2.08 mL of a 1.2 molar solution of diisobutylaluminium hydride in toluene was added to the etheric solution at -78 °C. The solution was stirred for 2 h. The progress of the reaction was controlled with thin layer chromatography (DCM : methanol 9:1)(Rf(product) UV 244/356 nm = 0.81). 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine was used to check for the presence of the aldehyde. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2.0 mL of methanol. Then, 9 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution were added. The temperature was allowed to rise up to 0 °C and 16 mL of water were added.  Both layers were separated and the aqeuous layer was extracted twice with 50 mL of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvents were removed in vacuo the next day. A orange oil was obtained.
The signal of the aldehyde (expected at shifts of around 10 ppm) was missing in the NMR. Further, the NMR confirmed the presence of unreacted methyl 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxylate.

Synthesis of NH-nor-Pyochelin
The synthesis of N-demethylated pyochelin was a four-step synthesis, starting from 2-hydroxybenzonitrile.
In a cyclization reaction, 2-hydroxybenzonitrile reacted with (R)-cysteine ​​hydrochloride in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) and methanol (ratio 1: 1) overnight at 60 ° C. The resulting carboxylic acid was isolated as a yellow solid and was the precursor for the further course of the synthesis.
Two synthetic routes were tried: The synthesis route via the ester and the route via the Weinreb amide.
First, the synthetic route through the ester was tried out: the carboxylic acid was esterified in absolute methanol with sulfuric acid as the catalyst.
The ester was isolated as a yellow oil.
The resulting methyl ester was then reduced to the corresponding aldehyde in a diisobutylaluminum hydride reduction.
The corresponding aldehyde was isolated as a yellow solid, which due to its strong reactivity could not be stored and had to be reacted directly.
The preparation of N-demethylated pyochelin was achieved in a cyclization of the aldehyde with (R)-cysteine ​​hydrochloride in an ethanol/water mixture with potassium acetate as buffer overnight in the dark.
It was found that the N-demethylated pyochelin thus obtained was still heavily contaminated with unreacted ester.
Since this result was not satisfactory, the weinreb amide route was decided to be tried.
For this purpose, the carboxylic acid was reacted in dichloromethane as a solvent under EDCI hydrochloride activation with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine to the corresponding weinreb-amide.
The weinreb amide was purified by column chromatography and isolated as a yellow solid.
Subsequently, the weinreb amide was converted into the corresponding aldehyde in a lithium aluminum hydride reduction.
Due to its instability the aldehyde was condensed directly with (R-)cysteine to yield N-demethylated pyochelin.
The N-demethylated pyochelin was isolated as a yellow solid and was present as a mixture of three diastereomers.
As part of the weinreb amide route, it was possible to synthesize N-demethylated pyochelin in satisfactory yield and purity.
Compounds were characterized using 1H-, 13C- and 2D NMR spectroscopy.
Complexation
As a siderophore analog, N-demethylated pyochelin is able to complex trivalent metal ions.
The goal was to complex the N-demethylated pyochelin with iron (III) and gallium (III).
The respective complexation reactions were carried out in ethanol and monitored by UV spectroscopy.
The respective UV spectra are shown in the figures x, y and z.
Fig. x: UV-Vis spectrum of NH-nor-pyochelin and its complexes with iron and gallium.
Fig. y: UV-Vis spetrum of NH-nor-pyochelin and of NH-nor-pyochelin after adding iron(III) chloride taken at certain times.
Fig. z: UV-Vis spetrum of NH-nor-pyochelin and of NH-nor-pyochelin after adding gallium(III) nitrate taken at certain times.
Figure x shows the UV spectrum of the ligand (nor-pyochelin) in black, the associated iron complex in red, and the gallium complex in green.
Furthermore, it can be seen from the figure that in both cases a complexation must have taken place, since the position of the transitions have in part clearly changed their shape.
This becomes particularly clear when looking at the gallium complex.
Furthermore, figures y and z show the respective kinetic measurements for the formation of the iron (y) and gallium complex (z).
Note: the syntheses have been carried out multiple times.
(Number in brackets corresponds to the number of attempts. The reactions with the best results have been chosen.)
Characterisation of the compounds was carried out with1H-, 13C- and 2D-NMR spectra.

The crude product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel mesh 40 - 63, ligroin 50 - 70 : ethyl acetate 1 : 2). The solvents were removed in vacuo. A yellow oil was obtained, which crystallized in the freezer over night.
Yield: 96 mg of a yellow solid were obtained. This corresponds to a yield of 28 %.

Reduction of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-N-methoxy-N-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxamide to 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carbaldehyde (aldehyde) (2)
The reaction was carried out under intert atmosphere and with dry solvents
100 mg of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-N-methoxy-N-methyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxamide have been dissolved in 5 mL of diethyl ether. The solution was cooled down to - 20 °C. 40 mg of lithium tetrahydridoaluminate(III) were added to the solution at once. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at -20 °C. The reaction was monitored by TLC (DCM : methanol 9 : 1) and checked for aldehyde presence with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. After 20 minutes, 2.5 mL of methanol were added at -20 °C, followed by the addition of 5 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution and 5 % (v/v) sulfuric acid solution. The aqueous phase was extracted with 10 mL ethyl acetate thrice. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. Ethyl acetate was removed in vacuo.
Yield: 64 mg of a yellow powder was obtained. This corresponds to a yield of 82 %.
As already mentioned, the aldehyde was too unstable to conduct analysis and thus used immediately.
Synthesis of 2-(2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrothiazol-4-yl)thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (N-demethylated pyochelin) from the amide (2)
64 mg of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carbaldehyde (see above) were dissolved in 6.0 mL ethanol and 1.5 mL of water. 83 mg L-cysteine hydrochloride and 208 mg potassium acetate were added. The solution was stirred overnight (16 h) in the dark. The ethanol was then removed in vacuo and the residue diluted with water. The pH of the aqueous phase was set to 5 by addition of solid citric acid. The aqueous phase was then extracted with ethyl acetate thrice. All the organic extracts were pooled, dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. Ethyl acetate was removed in vacuo. The resulting yellow oil was then dissolved in a minimal amount of DCM, and cyclohexane was added until the solution became cloudy. The solvents were removed in vacuo.

Synthesis of 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid
Synthesis of 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid
The 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid  was synthesized in an one step sythesis from R-cysteine hydrochloride and 2,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile.
For this cyclisation reaction the R-cysteine and 2,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile were solved in methanol and refluxed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 6.4) and sodium bicarbonate for 6h and afterwards stirred overnight.
The analogon was aquired as a light orange powder.
We chose to synthesize this analogon due to decreased toxicity compared to the original siderophore.
As with the other siderophores, complexation was carried out in a cuvette, which was monitored with UV-Vis spectroscopy. The spectra can be found below (fig. g, h, i)
Fig. g: UV-Vis spetrum of 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid  and its complexes with gallium and iron.
Fig. h: UV-Vis spetrum of 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid  before and after addition of iron(III) chloride.
Fig. i: UV-Vis spetrum of 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid  before and after addition of gallium(III) nitrate.
The difference between the free ligand and the complexes is clearly visible in the spectra. Like pyochelin and its analogue, the complex formation with iron occured much faster than the gallium complex formation.
The reaction was carried out under inert atmosphere.
Two solutions were prepared:
Solution 1: 1.50 g 2,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile were dissolved in 48 mL of methanol and degassed twice with the freeze-pump-thaw method.
Solution 2: 2.64 g (R)-cysteine hydrochloride and 1.46 g sodium bicarbonate were dissolved in 30 mL 0.1 M PBS (pH 6.4).
Both solutions were combined and degassed twice using the freeze-pump-thaw method.
Subsequently, the reaction mixture was heated at 80 ° C for 6 hours.
The mixture was stirred for 16.5 hours and then the pH was adjusted to 2 with 12 ml of a 1N hydrochloric acid solution in water.
Thereafter, the precipitate was washed three times with 40 mL of distilled water and then twice with 40 mL of ethanol. The residual solvents were removed in vacuo.
Yield: 2.143 g (8.97 mmol, 49 %)
1H-NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, 20 °C): δ [ppm] = 13.06 (s, 1H), 12.63 (s, 1H), 10.26 (s, 1H), 7.25 (d, 1H), 6.38 (dd, 1H), 6.31 (d, 1H), 5.38 (dd, 1H), 3.65 (dd, 1H),3.57 (dd, 1H).
Iron Complexation
To find how efficient the product is, several photometric kinetic studies were conducted. First, the iron complexation of all synthesized siderophores was explored to have a baseline to compare other measurements with. The final goal was to find out if the complexation is necessary beforehand or if an already tried approach, applying gallium and siderophores directly, is the efficient route to go. This measurement was a bit of a failure since the premisse was followed that gallium/iron are bound to our siderophores in a 1:2 ratio. Which is true but only if the siderophores are provided in excess. In this experiment we added twice as many siderophores as ions to our respective solution which defiled the results.
Even though the experimental setup was flawed we can deduce some results from the presented results. Two premisses need to be set. As Mislin et. al. showed the 2:1 (siderophore, ion) complex forms only when we have a vast overrepresentation of siderophores, secondly the kinetics for the second siderophore binding is very slow and the binding is weak.  The first thing that can be deduced is that obviously 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)thiazole-4(R)-carboxylic acid n does not experience a shift in its absorption during complex formation, or that the complex formation is so fast that we were unable to monitor it at all. Secondly we can clearly see that the NH-nor-pyochelin signal intensifies when the iron complex forms, even though the complexation seems to proceed very quickly as the signal does not experience a later shift.
Gallium Complexation
After the experiments to observe the iron chelation with our siderophores, gallium chelation experiments with all three siderophores were conducted. This was dont in order to measure the specific affinity for gallium in comparison to iron, the native chelate ion. It is very important to check if the gallium is not expelled from the complex due to a vastly higher affinity of the siderophores to iron. If utilized as an antibiotic, the surrounding media will be very scarce of iron, still many of the experiments were conducted in iron containing media to find out if potential bounce back mechanisms after gallium extraction from the siderophores took place.
