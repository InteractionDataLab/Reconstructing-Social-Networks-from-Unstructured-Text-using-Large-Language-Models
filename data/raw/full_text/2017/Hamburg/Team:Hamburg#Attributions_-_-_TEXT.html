Team Members
Team leader
Shanti Ricke
Shanti was one of this year’s team leaders and engaged with the development and execution of our project idea. He chose our target organisms Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the corresponding siderophores and genes. Furthermore, he designed our BioBricks and spend most his time in both the S1 and S2 labs to supervise and perform the experiments. His responsibilities included the organisation of the chemistry labs and the S2 lab and the communication with our cooperation partners and guest speakers.
He arranged a lot of the preparations and execution of our Human Practices activities. He also had a part in sponsoring, writing our Wiki and established himself as contact person for everybody. If you have any questions or problem – he’s your man!
Vice-Team leader
Elisabeth Orlowski
Elli was also a team leader mostly in charge of sponsoring, Social Media and lend a hand with our wiki. In the lab she worked in the S1 and S2 life science labs and was responsible for the toxicology tests in the cell culture as well as for the growth inhibition assays with the pseudomonas. For sponsoring she mainly organized the crowd funding campaign and was involved in all legal matters and support for our sponsors.
Alina Nicolai
Alina was one of our two vice team leaders this year. She worked in the S1- and S2- lab, for which she was in charge of designing the parts and developing the project design. She was also involved in sponsoring, our wiki and human practices.
Head of Sponsoring
Valerie Heine
Valerie was our golden girl and sponsoring queen involved in everything organising. She spent every free minute in the labs where she proved herself (basically) irreplaceable. She took care of keeping everything in order and made sure we did not descend into chaos. Besides she found time to work on our wiki (and harassing everybody into keeping the lab books updated) and helped organising our Human Practices activities.
Head of Human Practices
Geoffrey N. Youett
Geoffrey is a true organisation talent and knows probably more people than all our team members together. Consequently, he took charge of our Human Practices, made contacts and wrote application letters for our events. Despite not having a background in science, he joined the lab team and helped in sponsoring and writing of our wiki. He also assisted with several cooperations.
Head of Finances
Ruth Rietow
Ruth has a rare gift for numbers and took care of all our finances and accounting, which she did formidable. She was involved in basically every part of our project and spend a considerable amount of time in the S1 and S2 labs, helped with sponsoring and wrote parts of our wiki. She also kept team spirit alive thanks to her amazing baking skills.
Biochemistry
Guillermo Molina
Guillermo worked in the S1 and S2 lab. He wrote on our wiki and generously shared the chocolate he always had in his coat and that helped to prevent the occasional nervous breakdown. Also without him we would have probably starved, as he always prepared and organized food for everyone.
Annika Soltau
Annika is a treasure in the lab.  She kept the work in the S1 lab alive and moved in the S2 lab later. She also helped with the sponsoring too and worked on our wiki.
Desiree Brösamle
Desiree was a real help in the lab. She worked mainly in the S1 lab and took charge of the S2 lab every now and then. She was involved in sponsoring and the wiki and made sure we took a break to have lunch during lab hours.
Franziska Dörr
Franzi worked in the S1 lab and helped with the sponsoring.
Svenja Reich
Svenja was involved in the S1 lab work and helped with the sponsoring and our wiki.
Timo "Kutte" Zeimet
Kutte worked in the S1 and S2 lab and helped with sponsoring and the wiki.
Kamil Grzegorczyk
Kamil contributed the foundation of our project by bringing up the idea of using gallium siderophores as an antibacterial strategy.
Chemistry
Carla von Salisch
Carla performed a chemical synthesis of desferrithiocine, helped in the S1 lab, with sponsoring and managed the ordering of the chemicals.
Jan-Christian Raabe
Jan-Christian synthesised the siderophor nor-pyocheline and performed the complexation with gallium. He also helped in the S1 lab, with sponsoring and writing our wiki.
Martin Borowski
Martin worked on two ways to synthesise the siderophore pyocheline to determine how to achieve the best yield. He was involved in sponsoring and the wiki too.
Nanoscientists
Tim Erichlandwehr
Tim helped to develop the nano part of our project and established the contact to Prof. Trebbin, who supervised the nanoscience project. He also helped with sponsoring.
Nico Brkovic
Nico developed the PDMS chip, the membrane and the microfluidic device with Ramakrishnan, a doctorate student in our supervising group. He also helped in the S1 and S2 labs, with sponsoring and the wiki. He organised the system for the pump and the devices.
Sören Hecht
Sören worked in the S1 lab, helped with the sponsoring and the organising of the pump for the nano experiments. He also wrote part of our wiki and was involved in public relations.
Graphics
Jannes Ernsting
Jannes is part of the graphic design team and was responsible for our web design.
Leona Bruners
Leona is also part of the graphic design team and made the model for our logo, and our famous schokofroschkarten.
Julian Strunck
Julian is another graphic design student who developed the logo with Tom with Leona’s model as template.
Tom Böhl
Tom developed the logo with Julian after Leonas’s template.
Jannes, Leona, Julian and Tom worked together on the design and corporate design and helped us chose our team name. They also worked on our Social Media presentation, took our team photos and filmed the Crowd-founding video. To sum it up: everything that looks good is their work!
Psychology
Frank-Olaf Lohmann
Frank-Olaf was our person to talk to about every possible problem within the team. He is very experienced in the business environment and project planning. With his experience and psychological backround he provided us with many insights regarding team structure, workflow and communications. He also did a retrospective with us to work out what went well and where our project could have needed some improvement.
Our Instructors and Advisors
Primary PI
Zoya Ignatova
Professor Zoya Ignatova is supervising iGEM Hamburg for the third time supervising as a primary Principal Investigator of our team. She is professor for biochemistry at the University of Hamburg and specified in RNA biochemistry, in particular on tRNAs. Besides offering us her advice, she provided us with a S1 lab space, the equipment and support of her group. She stood by our side for any questions and problems and gave us a free hand to enable us to develop and execute our own project.
Secondary PI
Andreas Czech
Andreas is for the first time acting as secondary Principal Investigator for the iGEM Team Hamburg. He stood by our side the entire year to give advice, provide us with chemicals and materials and figure out the handling of the plate reader. Furthermore, he supervised our expression test and always helped with any seemingly unsolvable problem!
Frauke Adamla
Frauke is for the second time participating as secondary Principal Investigator. She introduced us to the basics of lab work. Until she left the university in summer she was our first contact person and gave us advice even after she was gone. We are very sad about her leave which is a great loss for us and the following teams. Thank you for always being there for us!
Instructor
Peter Heisig
Peter Heisig was born in 1958 and studied pharmacy at the Free University of Berlin. After his PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, he qualified as a professor at the University of Bonn and was appointed professor for pharmaceutical biology and microbiology at the University of Hamburg in 2000. He and his group carry out research on the development, spreading and consequences of antibiotic resistances with a special interest in fluoroquinolones. In addition to being head of the group, he is a safety advisor for the S2 lab and also involved in teaching the pharmacy students.
We converted him to our project when we presented our ideas and won him over as an instructor for our team. He patiently discussed our experiments with us and offered lots of helpful hints and new approaches for the design as well as for troubleshooting. He regularly asked about the progress of our project and always made time for our issues. Furthermore, he invited us to his group and offered us some space in his S2 lab on short notice when our former lab suddenly was closed down and therefore saved us from interrupting our lab work and wasting a lot of time.
Anke Heisig
Anke Heisig, born in 1961, is a biologist. She studied at the Free University of Berlin before she did her PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics and then moved on to the University of Bonn where she run the DNA sequencing service.
She started working at the University of Hamburg in 2004. Here, she is the head of the DNA analytic service (including next generation sequencing) and safety advisor. Her research  focuses on antibiotic resistances.
She warmly welcomed us when we moved to the Heisig’s lab on the spur of the moment and did everything in her power to help us setting up our new working space which included finding us basic equipment that we could borrow until we were able to bring our own. As her husband, she was very interested in our project, became an instructor for our team and always had a sympathetic ear for our questions and problems. She advised us on the design of the experiments and troubleshooting  and was of great help especially designing the toxicity tests.
Ignatova Lab
Ingrid Goebel
Ingrid is a technical assistant in Prof. Ignatova’s and a true treasure. She seems to know the answer to any question and always gives good advice – and most importantly: she knows where to find literally everything! She also took care of our orders and offered council in any situation. Her long experience in the lab and work with the iGEM teams of the last years enabled her to help with very specific problems and the handling of any machine. And even when she was busy she always took time for us and never let us down!
Maximilian Anders
Max is amazing! He knows (according to everyone else) the most unconventional methods to try that always work. He was a great help with mutagenesis primer design, back-to-back PCR and ligation.
Robert Rauscher
Robert is master of the cell culture and keeper of the lung epithelial cells that he gave us for our toxicity tests and the lung-on-a-chip device. He also gave us advice whenever needed.
Christine Polte
Christine is the second technical assistant in Prof. Ignatova’s lab. She ordered lab material for us and made sure we got everything.
Katrin Kröger
Katrin is the secretary of Prof. Ignatova and helped us with the paper work and legal questions. Without her we would never have made it.

Heisig Lab
Gudrun Melles
Gudrun is one of the technical assistants of the Prof. Heisig’s lab and was a great help during our time in the S2 lab. She knows where everything is and the best methods. Her advice was especially valuable for the toxicity tests and the work with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosas. She gave us different strains and everything else we needed to work with them. Gudrun also showed us how to identify and classify bacterial strains. For many of us it was the first time in a S2 lab and she helped us to work our way through it to get comfortable.  She tried different DNA measurement techniques with us to see if it makes a difference (not really, but it was cool to try!). Not to forget she supported us during our rushed relocation to the pharmacy after the closure of our chemistry department and run some gels for us while we did not yet have security clearance and couldn’t work.
Philipp Groth
Philipp the second (seriously, why is every man in this lab called Philipp?) is also a technical assistant and a very cool guy. He helped us during our move to the pharmacy and with any questions and help with machines. He always found solutions and lightened our mood when nothing seemed to work out the way we wanted to. In the last stage of our experiments he supervised the chemists during their kinetic measurements of the complexation without despairing.
Anna Podolska
Anna worked on the same floor where our S2 lab was and our daily contact person in the Heisig lab. She explained to us how to use the machines, made us feel welcome in the lab and was always there for us when we needed help. She really is a sweetheart!
Phyllis Zimmermann
Alina Schwarz
Philipp Hebel
Greta Gulbins
And all associated
They all helped us after our sudden move from the chemistry department to the pharmacy department after the labs had to close and made us feel welcome and part of their group. They showed us around in the new lab, taught us how to handle the higher security degree and even shared their materials with us. Without their great support, we couldn’t continue working and would have been forced to give up the project or at least lost a great amount of time. Thank you very, very much for everything you did for us, your friendship and the cookies! And the cake! And all the coffee!
Advisors
Henning Jacobsen
Henning started his PhD on virology in November 2016. He was an iGEM-Teamleader in Hamburg in 2015 and now acts as advisor for the following teams. He is basicly our bad guy, constantly telling everyone that he or she is too lazy and that we need more money. If Henning attends the seminar to “make a serious announcement” he is feared more than Prof. Snape.  Besides the fact that he is at least right about the last fact, he further developed the concept of our lab and is a driving force behind new non-scientific collaborations. He already did a great job advising the last team in 2016 (Finding Chlamydory) and agreed on serving another year as advisor for our team. Thank you for your support!
Daniel Wedemeyer
Daniel was one of the team leader of last year’s team and offered his support as advisor of our team. After receiving his O.W.L grades leading iGEM Team Hamburg 2016, Daniel is Prefect, uhm, advisor for this year’s team. With Hamburg 2016 he was on hunt for Chlamydories, a completely different kind of creatures they were only able to catch with their magic detection bacteria. As advisor, he introduced us to BioBrick design, Defence against the Dark arts, HTML and the wiki, sponsor acquisition, and is always happy to share his experience in Niffler taming. Thank you for your advice!

Katharina Hoffmann
She helped us a great deal at the beginning of our project but sadly couldn’t stay since she moved for a semester abroad to South Korea. Thank you for being part of our team!
Dorian Orlikowski
He helped us with sponsoring and later in the lab too, but went on to see the world too. Thanks for your help!
Caroline Oertzen
She was involved in the sponsoring but had to put her regular studies first. Thanks for being with us!

Our Collaboration Partners
TU Delft
The TU Delft organized this year’s European iGEM Meet up where a delegation of our team had a great time participating! We met many new friends and cooperation partners for our project. The topic of the TU Delft iGEM team fit very well to ours and we considered a cooperation which sadly did not work out in the end due to lack of time. Another cooperation with them and the iGEM Team Aalto-Helsinki couldn’t be realised for the same reason. Thank you for the year and the cooperation offer!
Evry
Evry is a great team with lovely people and great scientists! We had trouble with a ligation of a gen in three parts, and they found the solution – a Golden Gate Assembly! Since we hadn’t designed one yet and were already delayed in our planning, we couldn’t work it out on our own. Jeremy developed a complete program for us ready to work with, from the primer design to sending us a suitable vector. They supported us during the entire length of the experiment. A great thank you to Jeremy and his wonderful Team Evry!
Aalto-Helsinki
We met the iGEM Team Aalto-Helsinki at the European iGEM Meeting in Delft. They developed a usage for the peptide dermcidine, but since they did not have access to a S2 lab they could not perform any tests. We offered them our facilities in cooperation with the TU Delft, unfortunately we did not have enough time for it in the end. Thank you for the nice time!
Heidelberg
The team Heidelberg is an expert in PCR an offered their help with their PCR-First Aid Service, which we used when we couldn’t get our reactions to work. Heidelberg listened to our problems and gave us valuable advice and tricks how to change our experiments. We went through several rounds of trial and error and they always came up with new ideas. Thank you to the team Heidelberg and especially Pauline for her immediate help!
Harvard
The iGEM Team Harvard developed a questionnaire to standardise interviews with experts. Since we had several interviews in the scope of our project, we were happy to participate working out some questions.
KU Leuven
The team of KU Leuven launched a wonderful program where the teams translate other projects into their own language. We took part in that project and thank the KU Leuven for their great idea and the teams of Duesseldorf-Cologne, Heidelberg, Pasteur_Paris, Peshawar, IONIS, Moscow_RF, NYMU_Taipei, Tec Chihuahua, UChile_OpenBio_CeBiB und XMU-China for their translations!
Peshawar
We had a Skype call with the iGEM Team Peshawar to exchange our experiences. Thanks for the nice meeting!
Cologne-Duesseldorf
As last year, the iGEM Team Cologne-Duesseldorf started a postcard information campaign in which we gladly participated. We designed a postcard ourselves and were send some by other teams, which we distributed at our university and events.
Franconia (Erlangen & Würzburg)
We could help the Team Franconia by providing some space on our poster at the Giant Jamboree to be able to perform the game they planned for the event: all the participants of the Jamboree together must look for a cure for an epidemic! What they don’t know: where on the side of the enemy! Thank you, Franconia, for letting us participate in your game!
Waterloo, UNebraska, Dalhousie, Greece, Vilnius-Lithuania and Washington
All of them created a survey that we participated in. We hope, it helped these teams to find their answers!
