After spending a summer at science camp in grade school she fell in love with science and knew that she wanted to grow up to become a scientist someday. During her studies at ASU she has been a finalist in two biomedical design competitions and works hard to continue to thrive in the engineering environment. In life, she hopes to be a part of a team that can someday help design life saving technologies for people in need. In her spare time, Amber enjoys playing the drums, hiking with her dogs and husband, and compound target archery.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6 center"><H2>Brianna Lopez </H2><P class="justify scroll">
Brianna Lopez is a second year Biomedical Engineering student. She has been interested in the realm of genetics and synthetic biology for several years, and is excited to be gaining experience with ASU iGEM. She aspires to engineer tools that will help battle diseases, and create artificial organs. When not in the lab performing serial dilutions, she is reading and enjoying a good campaign of D&amp;D.!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-6 center"><H2>Chris Connot</H2><P class="justify scroll">Chris Connot is a Post-Bacc Student earning his second degree in Biology with an emphasis in Neurobiology, Behavior and Physiology, on his way to a MD/Phd program starting in Fall of 2019. His first degree was in Physics which he earned at Arizona State University. During his first semester back in school, his Microbiology lab was the first time he realized that learning about the unseen world of living organisms was going to be a passion that would provide a driving force for years to come. His future aspirations lie in providing our society with medical tools that will give more power to individuals over their personal health. His personal hobbies and interests include growing mushrooms for local farmers markets and working on his 1976 Westfalia VW Bus. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6 center"><H2>Christina Smith</H2><P class="justify scroll">Christina Smith is a third year biomedical engineering student, minoring in mathematics at Arizona State University. She has been working as an undergraduate researcher at the Haynes lab for the past year. Her future goal is to incorporate more engineering principles into the field of microbiology and synthetic biology. She has learned a lot about quorum sensing and project design through the iGEM team and is very excited about what the future of bioengineering holds. Outside of the lab, she works at a dine-in movie theater, binge watches crime TV series on Netflix ,  and is an enthusiast landscape painter.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-6 center"><H2>Xylaan Livingstone</H2><P class="justify scroll">Xylaan Livingstone is a third-year genetics major attending Arizona State University. Since a young age he has always had a passion with making an impact on helping the world and feels through sciences it is truly possible. He is very excited to be a part of this year’s iGEM team, where he feels this a perfect environment to meet like minds and help further the world’s knowledge on the unknown. Outside of the lab, Xylaan enjoys listening to rap music, martial arts, and learning new trades.</P></DIV><H1>Graduate Mentors</H1><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-6 center"><H2>Stefan Tekel</H2><P class="justify scroll">Stefan Tekel is PhD student from northern Virginia and is currently researching chromatin protein engineering and drug delivery.
