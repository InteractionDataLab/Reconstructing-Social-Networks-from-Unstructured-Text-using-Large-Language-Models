Receiver Design
In our receiver design, there a multitude of parts attained that are already Bio-Brick verified. The table below shows the various parts from the BioBrick database used in our design. Promoters, ribosomal binding sites, terminators and green fluorescent protein were chosen. In addition to this information, the reason and description of how each works in our system is described.
