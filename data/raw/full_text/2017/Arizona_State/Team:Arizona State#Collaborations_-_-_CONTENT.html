ASU inquired about Chennai’s promoter prediction tool and offered an option to collaborate and provide feedback and any critique of the program.</P><P>August 17th: SVCE_Chennai responded to the email and requested a skype session to discuss the collaboration further.</P><P>August 18th: ASU iGEM shared a schedule of availability since there is a 12.5 hour time difference between the two countries. ASU iGEM suggested some times for a skype call.</P><P>August 21st: SVCE_Chennai responded saying they were busy during the entire week but had availabilities to set up a Skype call on either Saturday or Sunday.</P><P>August 22nd: iGEM team member is unavailable and CC’s another team member who is available to attend a Skype chat with SVCE_Chennai on the weekend.</P><P>August 22nd: ASU iGEM team member who is available over the weekend emails SVCE_Chennai to confirm the availability for a Skype call.</P><P>August 25th: SVCE_Chennai responded to confirm a time for conversation on 9:30am Arizona time on Saturday Aug 26th.</P><P>August 25th: ASU iGEM team member responds via email to confirm the Skype appointment time for Saturday.</P><P>August 26th: Detailed Skype call between ASU iGEM and SVCE_Chennai (skype handle (igemsvce chennai) took place. The collaboration discussion included details about the promoter prediction tool that Chennai had written in Python. ASU iGEM talked about how the promoter tool could be a great asset as our team had some issues with leaky expression in our synthetic gene circuits and the promoter tool could help us predict if the issue was within our promoters. ASU iGEM also expressed that they could provide the Chennai team back with detailed information about how well the python code for the promoter prediction tool was working and if there was any other additional feedback and critiquing they had for them to improve the tool. Chennai stated that they would share the Python code for the prediction tool via email.</P><P>September 14th: Several emails later and no reply from the SVCE_Chennai team ASU iGEM reached out to our PI, Dr. Karmella Haynes, to try and get some help reaching Chennai as we were ready to complete our collaboration and were only waiting on the promoter tool code to be sent.</P><P>September 14th: Dr. Karmella Haynes emailed the SVCE_Chennai team to check in on them and offer help with any issues finishing the code or otherwise. There was never a response from Chennai. </P><P>September 26th: There was still no reply to any of ASU iGEM emails trying to get back in touch with Chennai for the completion of our collaboration. Dr. Karmella Haynes emailed the team leader/judge of Chennai trying to re-establish an open link for communication but there was still no success. ASU iGEM was able to reach the person who was in contact with Chennai but there was never any further contact with the actual team. There were a few more unsuccessful attempts to reach Chennai were attempted. </P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
