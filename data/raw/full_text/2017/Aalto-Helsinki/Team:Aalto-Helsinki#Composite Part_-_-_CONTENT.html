DCD1L peptide  linked to sumo fusion peptide with His6x tag.
This part comprises of a dermcidin derived antimicrobial peptide DCD-1L. This part allows expression of DCD-1L antimicrobial peptide in form of a fusion protein accompanied with His6x-Smt3 tag. The construct can be purified with commercially available and widely used affinity chromatography columns designed for His6x tag. Smt3 tag is used to keep antimicrobial peptide, DCD-1L, in inactive form by blocking its adhesion to phospholipid bilayer of the production host due to relatively large size of the tag. One major advantage of the fusion system used is that it facilitates easier detection of the peptide with a conventional method like SDS-PAGE. Also, SUMO tag is beneficial due to its effect on solubility of fusion peptide, significantly easing purification step.  After purification, to cleave off His6x-Smt3 tag, Ulp1 enzyme that is known for its robust and specific proteolytic activity against SUMO fusion proteins, is used to obtain free DCD-1L antimicrobial peptide.

DCD1L peptide linked to CBM with 22 AA linker (6XHis-Smt3_DCD1L_22Linker_CBM).
This part comprises of a dermcidin derived antimicrobial peptide DCD-1L linked to a Cellulose binding domain (CBM) with a 22 amino acid linker. Cellulose binding domain (CBM3), from <I>Clostridium thermocellum</I>, is used to immobilize DCD-1L on cellulose based materials. This part allows expression of DCD-1L antimicrobial peptide in form of a fusion protein accompanied with His6x-Smt3 tag on the N-terminus and CBM on C-terminus (6XHis-Smt3_DCD1L_22Linker_CBM) in <I>E.coli</I> without killing the host bacteria.

Preventing pathogen colonization on surfaces is crucial in order to prevent spreading of infectious diseases. Therefore, immobilization of antimicrobial peptides can be a good alternative to other bactericidal agents because of their wide antibiotic spectrum, given that immobilization is a known way of increasing stability and resilience of peptides. 
</P><P id="paragraph">
For this purpose, we designed a construct containing a cellulose binding domain (CBM3), from <I>Clostridium thermocellum</I>, to immobilize DCD-1L on cellulose based materials. Our CBM constructs contain 22 amino acid long linker, to avoid interference with hexameric complex formation that leads to cell death. Cellulose is a medically safe, eco-friendly, and abundant material, already present or easily incorporated into many applications. Additionally versatile nature of cellulose materials from plastic-like hard materials to hydrogels expands application possibilities. Application range can be further increased through altering the part by changing DCD-1L to another AMP in this expression system .
