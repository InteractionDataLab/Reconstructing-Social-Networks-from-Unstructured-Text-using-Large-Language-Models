Media
In order to keep our audience informed of the state of our project and in order to promote synthetic biology, we kept our social media channels active. We mostly used Facebook and Instagram where we kept posting multiple times a week. Since the Facebook algorithms seemed to promote our posts more on our followersâ€™ news feeds when published less frequently, we often scheduled our posts to appear every other day, focusing on the times when people would most likely be online. Twitter and Linkedin were used occasionally.
Tumblr was used as a platform for our blog where we published longer posts about our team members, meetings with companies and interviews. The blog posts were then shared on our Facebook page in order to reach more readers. In the beginning of our journey we updated the website of the last year's team to represent our project, which we also used as an official info page about us when introducing ourselves to new acquaintances. Later on we handed out our business cards with all the social media channels to everyone who wanted to keep in touch or learn more about our project.
Aalto Magazine
We will also use Aalto Magazine by Aalto University to promote our achievements and iGEM in general in order to reach as many new candidates as possible to apply for the next Aalto-Helsinki team in 2018.
LOIMU Magazine
We will have an article in LOIMU Magazine (The Union of Professionals in Natural, Environmental and Forestry Sciences) about our team, project and iGEM in general in order to promote the Aalto-Helsinki team and find new candidates for the next Aalto-Helsinki team.
Opinion Piece in the Biggest Finnish Newspaper
During the summer there was an article about the negative sides of sweating in the biggest Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat . We decided to turn the discussion the other way around and write an opinion article about the health benefits of sweating and the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin. Our opinion article was published in Helsingin Sanomat, which is definitely one of the best channels to reach a wide range of people and get visibility. The English translation can be found in our blog post .
Upgraded Life Festival
We attended the Upgraded Life Festival during the spring. It was an event where many companies, startups and health tech professionals gathered together to discuss the field and show what they are doing! The event organizer - HealthSPA - even wrote about us in their blog: You can read it here .
Synapsi - The Inkubio Guild Magazine
Our project will be discussed in Inkubio's guild magazine: Synapsi, in December. Inkubio is the Aalto University guild for the Bachelor's program in Bioinformation Technology.
