            We chose the plasmid pET28a(+) as our vector since it offers the advantage of having a His6x tag in the plasmid backbone, thus
            enabling affinity purification of the produced proteins.

                The pET28a(+) vector contains a T7<I>lac</I> promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTC) which consists of the T7 promoter
                and downstream of that the <I>lac</I> operator sequence. In addition, the vector contains the gene <I>lacI</I>, which encodes
                for the lac repressor (LacI) that binds to the <I>lac</I> operator. This promoter can be induced by isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside
                (IPTG) [<A name="ref3" href="#refl3">3</A>].

            Once we had the plasmid with Smt3, our next step was to insert the DCD-1L fragment into the plasmid. After cloning and plasmid

            expression culture. SDS-PAGE image (Figure 24) shows that after induction of protein expression with IPTG, the band
            corresponding to the gene of interest gets gradually thicker, from the initial induction (well 1) to 4 hours post-induction (well 3). This proves
            that the T7 promoter system works as intended, without promoter leakage. However, there is a strong band in
            both the lysate (well 4) and the pellet (well 5) suggesting that the protein of interest was partially precipitated. Soluble
            portion of the protein seen in the lysate was successfully purified and can be seen in wells 7 and 8.

							First, the purified protein construct was cleaved with Ulp1 to cleave off the His6x-Smt3 tag coupled with subsequent heat inactivation of the enzyme. 
							For the binding assay, concentrations of 5 μM to 50 μM of peptide in low salt buffer were incubated with 150 μg of cellulose nanoFibrils (CNF).

                            Control samples of matching peptide concentrations were prepared without the addition of CNF. 
							The total sample volume for both samples was 100 μl. 
							The samples were mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, after which the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g 
							and the supernatant was extracted for SDS-PAGE analysis. Prepared SDS-PAGE samples were run in a 12% acrylamide gel and the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie blue.
							 For DCD-1L-22 aa linker-CBM we expect a band at 23.8 kDa. The difference in the DCD-1L-22 aa linker-CBM bands between samples containing 150 µg CNF and those with no added CNF should correspond to 
							 the amount of protein successfully bound to the cellulose substrate. 
							 The SDS-PAGE gels for varying protein concentrations have been presented in Figure 42. 
							 Based on the SDS-PAGE analysis, we can determine that the CBM linked to our fusion protein remains active and successfully binds to CNF.

                            From the Figures 41(a,b) and 42(a,b) we can observe that our CBM binds to the CNF due to lack of or notably fainter bands in the lanes with CNF. As the concentration of peptides increases, 
							we also observe the protein bands in wells with CNF (Figure 41(c) and 42(c)). This is because the CNF is saturated with high concentration of protein and there are many unbound 
							proteins in the solution.

                            One thing to note here is the presence of  the strong band between 15 kDa and 20 kDa which is unidentified. Our initial suspicion regarding the unidentified band was that it corresponds to free CBM based on its molecular weight of 17.4 kD. 
							However, this band is also present in wells with CNF meaning that this band can not contain CBM given that CBM bands are not seen due to 
							CNF-CBM binding. Thus we conclude that it is most likely not the cleaved CBM. Another possibility is that Ulp1 enzyme cleaves the construct at a position between the 22 linker leaving His6x-Smt3-DCD-1L - with molecular weight 18.3 kDa- free from CBM. But we are unclear about it since we haven not observed this in any of our previous experiment 
							gels. For future perspectives, it would be interesting to probe the recombinant protein structure for homologous Ulp1 cleavega sites through modeling.
