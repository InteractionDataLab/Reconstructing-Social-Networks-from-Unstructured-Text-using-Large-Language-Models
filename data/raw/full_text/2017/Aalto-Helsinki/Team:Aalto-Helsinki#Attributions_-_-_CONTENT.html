I was selected as a team leader and therefore interviewed the most potential applicants and influenced the selection of our this year’s team members. As a team leader, I made sure that our team is always on schedule and everybody in the team knows what their responsibilities are and how to proceed with them. I have lead the discussions in our team meetings, helped other team members in solving problems, answered countless emails and created to-do-lists. I actively participated in ideation and first-stage background research and later focused mostly on collaborations, fundraising, human practises, applications, visits, travelling and wiki. To the wiki, I wrote on the pages Silver, Integrated Human Practices, Entrepreneurship, Dialog, Ethics, Safety, Education, Collaborations. I also helped in laboratory work, especially during the Fall.

 The main responsibilities were updating our team website, aaltohelsinki.com and developing our wiki page with Matilda, who was responsible for the UI design. I implemented the wanted functions and look with html, css and jquery. Together with Matilda, we also planned the wiki structure and figured out how iGEM works, how the judging system works and which pages are required. In addition to the web work, I actively participated in ideation, planning, visits and interviews, fundraising and application discussions. I was the secretary of our association, completed the Interlab study together with Maisa, and when I could, helped out in the laboratory. I taught some basic html and css skills to our team members as well as to the Estonian team who visited us. We organized a modelling workshop/presentation to the Finnish International Biology Olympiad team with Maisa. To the wiki, I wrote on the pages Ethics, Safety, Interlab, Dialog and Education.

My main responsibility was to investigate possible applications of the antimicrobial peptide, as well as to create and test product concepts of using it with cellulose materials. In the early project stage, I was involved in creating the budget and fundraising. Later, I also became a &quot;LB agar plate master&quot;, i.e., providing company for our lab people and supporting them by doing small tasks. Most of the application-related background research, such as market research and research for each possible application area (wound care, acne, implants, 3D-printing etc.) was done by me. We ideated the product packaging with Matilda, after which I designed a 3D-model of it and organized its manufacture. I was involved with hydrogel formulation and testing, such as viscosity and contamination tests. Together with Matilda, we drew conclusions of our testing and further developed the product. I contacted and visited the Urlinski cosmetics production line manufacturer in Poland in order to learn more about the large-scale production of cosmetics. I was responsible for analyzing the results of the survey with Jenny. To the wiki, I wrote about patents, viscosity and contamination tests as well as market research.

I was one of our main lab persons. Thus, I did a lot of background research on our topic, and designed and planned our experiments together with Usha and Meryem. Together with Meryem, we designed our constructs. I taught Jenny how to use Geneious so she could design primers for our BioBricks. Since I was more experienced with genetics I could offer my expertise when it was needed in the lab. I spent most of my time in the lab performing experiments, but I also took part in some of our human practice activities and visits, as well as collaborations related to the lab work. I was one of the presenters in the Nordic iGEM Conference and have contributed a lot to the text in our first poster. I also communicated the lab results to the rest of the team.

During our project I was mainly taking care of application design and branding our project. I shared visual design responsibilities with Jenny and created designs for banners, flyers, photos and final poster. Wiki layout is also designed by me and together with Meo we created the structure. I have taken all the background photos for wiki. I took care and scheduled meetings with experts and interviewed people, contacted media and built up human outreach activities. For example, I had a huge role in organizing, designing and preparing the Heureka Science Center activities. I’ve written many articles about our project to different publishing outlets. I also learned lots of new skills for example writing html. Because of my background in design I was also taking care that our project is clear and understandable for people outside scientific fields. To the wiki I wrote the pages Story, The Concept, Applied Design and hugely contributed to Integrated Human Practices and Silver pages. A lot of the wiki illustrations, especially on the Human Practices were done by me. I took care of most of the steps in product development and material decisions regarding the consistency and components of the gel. The package design for the final product and our team sweaters and t-shirts were designed by me.

I have been working simultaneously between art and science, sharing graphic design tasks with Matilda and assisting the core lab team in the laboratory. I made the first poster for the European iGEM Meetup and took the individual photos of our team members. I made various GIFs and videos for our project which I scripted and narrated. I went through literature to learn more about acne and interviewed patients as well as specialists. I was responsible for replying to the comments and messages we received through our Facebook page and when our team leader was away I lead the Skype meetings from our part. I designed primers for our BioBricks, though we didn’t need them in the end. I held a workshop and taught other team members how to use Adobe Illustrator. For the wiki I made most of the illustrations explaining the laboratory work. I wrote about acne in general and its effects on mental health to the wiki. I also wrote about the lacking transparency in cosmetic markets to the ethics part of the wiki and contributed to other pages as well, such as Attributions and Dialog. I took part in fundraising and as the team’s treasurer I took care of invoices and our bank account. I worked on the survey result analysis with Michal. A big portion of the pictures and updates on our social media accounts were posted by me and I also managed our blog in the beginning. I also designed the Giant Jamboree presentation slides and was one of the presenters in Giant Jamboree.

In the beginning of our project I had a huge impact on the brainstorming sessions since I was very interested in biosensors and happened to come across dermcidin. I was one of the responsible people for lab work and experimental design along with Meryem and Oona. Since I was more experienced in antimicrobial testing I played a primary role when we planned our experiments. I spent most of my days in the lab working and also documenting our results and parts in wiki. The process also involved literature research and brainstorming for application ideas. Together with Meryem I documented the parts that we sent to the iGEM registry. Apart from lab, I was involved in designing our business model and took part in pitching, fundraising, planning entrepreneurial activities and documenting entrepreneurship page in wiki. Since I have a lot of experience in pitching, I had a huge role in composing the pitch for the BioFinland Pitching Competition and I gave presenting tips to others. Further I contributed towards integrated human practices, visiting hospitals and industry experts along with my team and writing blog posts. I was also one of the presenters at the Giant Jamboree.

I am a person most comfortable when working with numbers both large and small. Computational chemistry combines the small scale atomic phenomena with the large chucks of data that are often produced. Mostly due to my background, I was the person responsible for the modeling aspects of our project and acquired access to CSC's supercomputers among other things. I presented in various presentations and taught mathematical modeling to the International Biology Olympiad team. I also participated actively in the ideation part of our project as well as went through a lot of literature regarding the fundamental building blocks of our idea, namely dermcidin, cellulose-based materials and hydrogels. I was also responsible for InterLab with Meo. More on the lab side of things, I did cellulose binding tests with nanocellulose (CNF), viscocity and preservative testing of our hydrogel along with Michał and sterilized peach pits for the final product. As part of the project, I also did a lot of background research on implants, coatings, immobilization of peptides and preservatives. I chose the preservative for our products prototype. For the wiki, I wrote the modeling pages and edited and proofread some other pages from both lab and human practices.
