CHLAMYDOMONAS PROTOCOLS
Transformation Protocol (E. coli)
Culturing and Preserving Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii
Prior to beginning the culturing of the Chlamydomonas
1. Place cells upright away from direct sunlight in a tube rack or beaker. Keep them in a cool area at room temperature until they are ready to be cultured
(DO NOT leave them unattended for more than three days. If they are not going to be treated within the first 36 hours of arrival, transfer the cell culture to a weak nutrient solution like half-strength Alga-Gro® Medium or minimal growth medium).
2. Autoclave anything that will be touching the cell culture (Erlenmeyer flasks, pipette tips, etc.) for 15 minutes at 15 pounds of pressure
3. Set up the (2) 40 watt light bulbs about 45 to 60 cm above the culture
4. Cover the area in foil to retain heat
Beginning the culture
5. In a sterile hood, pipette 200mL of TAP medium into a 500mL Erlenmeyer flask
6. Pipette 10mL of the Chlamydomonas strain into a 500mL Erlenmeyer flask containing the 200mL fresh medium (If the medium is grown in a slant tube, in a sterile field, use an inoculating loop to pull out some of the Chlamydomonas and place it in the 200 mL of fresh medium)
7. Parafilm seal the Erlenmeyer flask to prevent contamination and place the flask on a stir plate on top of the petri dish lid
8. Check it every so often to make sure there is continuous movement (YOU DO NOT WANT ANY SHADOW AREAS)
9. Set a timer to alternate between light and dark every 12 hours
10. Using a spectrophotometer measure the growth of the cell culture everyday at the same times (Set the spectrophotometer at 750nm and use identical Kimax tubes)
11. Incubate the cell culture until the growth curve reaches 0.5
12. Once the cell culture reaches 0.5 on the spectrophotometer and the culture’s cell density of approximately 0.9-2.0 x 107 ml-1 (3-5 days after transfer, late linear phase), aliquot the cells into 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes
Have liquid nitrogen ready in a foam container to snap freeze the aliquots
Culturing Chlamydomonas on solid medium
1. Set up a sterile field
2. Add 100uL of the liquid culture to TAP agar plates using a sterile rod/glass beads
