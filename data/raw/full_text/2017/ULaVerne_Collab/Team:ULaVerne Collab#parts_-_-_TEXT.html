BBa_K2215001
FeSOD Clade A
   - This is a biobrick gene of FeSOD from Symbiodinium Clade A.
BBa_K2215002
FeSOD Clade C
   - This is a biobrick gene of FeSOD from Symbiodinium Clade C.
BBa_K2215003
CuZnSOD
   - This is a biobrick gene of CuZnSOD from Symbiodinium
BBa_K2215004
Putative Symbiodinium Promoter
   - This is a putative promoter that was taken from Symbiodinium.
BBa_K2215005
Putative Symbiodinium Terminator
   - This is a putative terminator that was taken from Symbiodinium.
Constitutive promoter expressing mCherry and FeSOD Clade A
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry and FeSOD from Symbiodinium Clade A under our pBR9 vector.
     pBR9 vector will direct the SOD to the cytoplasm.
Constitutive promoter expressing mCherry and FeSOD Clade C
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry and FeSOD from Symbiodinium Clade C under our pBR9 vector.
     pBR9 vector will direct the SOD to the cytoplasm.
Constitutive promoter expressing mCherry and CuZn SOD
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry and CuZn SOD under our pBR9 vector.
    pBR9 vector will direct the SOD to the cytoplasm.
Constitutive promoter expressing mCherry and FeSOD Clade A
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry and FeSOD from Symbiodinium Clade A under our pBR32 vector.
     pBR32 vector will direct the SOD to the chloroplast.
Constitutive promoter expressing mCherry and FeSOD Clade C
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry and FeSOD from Symbiodinium Clade C under our pBR32 vector.
     pBR32 vector will direct the SOD to the chloroplast.
Constitutive promoter expressing mCherry and CuZn SOD
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry and CuZn SOD under our pBR32 vector.
     pBR32 vector will direct the SOD to the chloroplast.
Proposed promoter expressing mCherry
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry with our proposed promoter under our pBR9 vector.
     pBR9 vector will direct the SOD to the cytoplasm.
Constitutive promoter that expresses mCherry with our proposed terminator
   - This is a circuit that expresses mCherry with a constitutive promoter and proposed terminator under our pBR9 vector.
     pBR9 vector will direct the SOD to the cytoplasm.
