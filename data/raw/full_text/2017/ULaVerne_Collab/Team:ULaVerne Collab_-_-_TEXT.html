SAFETY
A number of different coral species rely on their symbiotic relationship with Symbiodinium for nutrients and their symbiosis is responsible for sustaining a quarter to a third of the ocean’s biodiversity.
However, the excess release of greenhouse gases from natural biochemical processes and human activities have caused them to be trapped in Earth’s atmosphere, leading to an increase in ocean temperature by 1-2% every year.
This results in coral bleaching, which is the loss of color of Symbiodinium or the expulsion of Symbiodinium from its tissue.
Our research aims to reduce the accumulation and production of ROSs by upregulating superoxide dismutases (SOD) so that corals are able to withstand increasing ocean temperatures.
