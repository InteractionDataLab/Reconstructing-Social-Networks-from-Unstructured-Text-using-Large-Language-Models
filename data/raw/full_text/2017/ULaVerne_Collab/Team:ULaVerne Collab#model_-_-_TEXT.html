MODEL
The theoretical model of enzyme kinetics was interpreted using the Lineweaver-Burk equation stemmed from the Michaelis Menten equation. Assuming that the reaction rate for the forwards and backwards reaction of the dissociation and affiliation of the enzyme (superoxide dismutase, SOD) and the substrate (superoxide, O2-) are inversely proportional, time was irrelevant at equilibrium. This model examines the reaction between the substrate and two first order enzyme kinetics set of values when superoxide dismutase is upregulated to a new concentration. The red line indicates a faster reaction rate of the conversion between superoxide and superoxide dismutase into hydrogen peroxide because there is an increase in the amount of SOD in the cell. The blue line is an interpretation of the interaction between O2- and SOD under normal cell conditions.
