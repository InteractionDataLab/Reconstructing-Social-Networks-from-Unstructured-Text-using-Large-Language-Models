We discussed our projects with the York team. Because we were both using Chlamydomonas, we discussed transformation protocols, and they shared their protocols with us.
NU Kazakhstan
We sent the Kazakhstan team our wild type Chlamydomonas and our desired vectors so they could test their transformation methods on a wild type strain. In return, they transformed our vectors into the chlamydomonas and characterized our parts for us.
