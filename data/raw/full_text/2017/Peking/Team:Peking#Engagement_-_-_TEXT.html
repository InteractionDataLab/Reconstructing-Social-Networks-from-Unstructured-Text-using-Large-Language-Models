Game : "Beat It In Sequence!"
Education
This year, Peking iGEM made much effort outside the lab to establish a dialogue about synthetic biology             between us and the public. Besides sharing synthetic biology knowledge with professors and students from the             department of electrical engineering and computer science, we developed a web game, constructed a wiki-based             idea-sharing community, co-organized the 4th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Committee) and impressed             middle school students with interactive classes and OpenLab activities.
SynBioWiki
Peking iGEM hopes to cooperate with researchers and students enthusiastic about synthetic biology to build a             wiki-based encyclopedia exclusively for synthetic biology – SynBioWiki . Everyone can beneﬁt from SynBioWiki and contribute to it.
Our long-term goal is to make it a knowledge repository organized around the interdisciplinary view of             synthetic biology, and thus form an open idea-sharing community with active social functions based on this             website. SynBioWiki will hopefully serve as a bond between the practitioners of synthetic biology, and             equally importantly, a window for the public to gain knowledge of this booming subject.
Besides basic functions such as searching and editing, we introduced interactive social network features.

Discussing with Prof. Chen Jiang
SynBioWiki belongs to everyone with dense interest in synthetic biology. We are now sincerely inviting iGEM teams from all over the world and those of you who are pursuing careers related to synthetic biology, to participate in the construction of this website.
We sincerely present our invitation letter as well as a brief user guide:

Game : "Beat It In Sequence!"
In order to demonstrate the idea of sequential logic, we developed a web game and shared it with the public. The mechanism of our game is:
The player can control a drum set.
In every time unit a set of drums can be activated.
The drumbeats are meaningless and noisy until they are arranged in proper sequence to form a certain pattern of rhythm.
We hope that by playing our games, people will be able to:
Recognize what sequential logic is and why it is essential
Determine where sequential logic appears in nature and how it can be beneficial to people.
Voice their own ideas for novel designs that utilize sequential logic
Play the game!
Education
Again this year, Peking iGEM took part in nourishing the next generation of scientists, which has become a tradition.
We mainly carried out activities across middle schools of Beijing. We took an active part in the design and execution of a course on biotechnology in the affiliated high school of Peking university, bringing in fresh content on synthetic biology.
We believe that such communication should not stop at the classroom level, so we organized the Openlab Day in which we take the students around the lab, showing them cool stuff.
