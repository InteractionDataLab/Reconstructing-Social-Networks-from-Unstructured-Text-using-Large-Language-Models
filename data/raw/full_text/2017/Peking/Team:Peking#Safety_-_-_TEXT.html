Safe Shipment
This year, the Peking iGEM Team is trying to develop a framework of sequential logic circuits in cells.             Here we are going to share our experience in safety control.
Safe Project Design
Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
In our project, non-pathogenic strains of E. coli were the only chassis used to perform molecular cloning             and protein expression.
Choosing parts that will be environmental friendly
Harmful parts are not allowed in our project. The parts in our project are mostly commonly used recombinases             and expression control units (such as terminators and promoters widely used in research), so that none of             our parts would raise any safety issues according to current professional knowledge.
Safe Lab Work
According to the requirements of iGEM policy, in our daily bench work we never performed any dangerous             experiments or faced any unusual safety issues. Our bench work followed some basic regulations as             follows:
Duplicating a key to the laboratory without permission is strictly prohibited.
Participants need to understand the experiment completely.
Wear rubber gloves during all experimenters.
Steps with any probability of contamination should be performed in a biosafety cabinet.
Fire, electric heaters, and microwave ovens should never be left unattended.
All liquid and solid waste containing living organisms must be autoclaved.
Sanitize the lab using UV-light every week.
The last person to leave the lab should make sure that water, electricity, gas, and air conditioners                     have been turned off, and doors and windows have been locked before leaving.
Safe Shipment
As mentioned above, our DNA parts are absolutely safe because they encode safe proteins such as Bxb1 gp35             and their combinations with promoters/terminators. The DNA parts are safely contained within PCR tubes as             the Parts registry requires.
