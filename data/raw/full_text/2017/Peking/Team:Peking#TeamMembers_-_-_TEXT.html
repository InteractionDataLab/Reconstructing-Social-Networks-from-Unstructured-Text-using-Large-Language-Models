"You can't cheat the process."
Synthetic biology is cool and the time in lab is always attracting me so much. So I 'm willing to                     devote my time and energy to iGEM and synthetic biology. As the leader, I concern, organize and                     coordinate everything in our team. Of course, there is a division of labor and I mainly focus on                     two parts: biological experiments and human practice.
Qiu                         Jianhui
Clinical Medicine, Senior
"Life is fantastic."
I will become a doctor in the not far distant future and I hold the point that the synthetic                     biology is useful in many fields of medicine, which is why I do my best to become an iGEMer. I                     just keep arming pull in the team. And my hobby is to prepare pipette tips and reading. I really                     enjoy iGEM.

Biomedical Engineering, Junior
"Only the paranoid survive."
Working as director of modeling and data analytics for the team, Friedrich Fu views iGEM as                     a capstone design for an undergraduate aiming at Life Computing. His current work involves                     basic computational methods in theoretical neuroscience. He views the biological challenges                     with a data science perspective.
Dong Ziqi
Life Science, Junior
"This guy is lazy."
I'm Dong Ziqi, a junior student coming from the college of life sciences, Peking University. You                     could say my hobby is to seek interesting things out of the boring time.                     My works in the iGEM team are doing project planning and leading the “brick-carriers” in the lab.

Zhang                         Songyuan
Life Science, Sophomore
"Survival of the fittest."
Zhang Songyuan mainly participates in the tasks of wetlab and                     helps with the financial. He thinks there must be a mysterious force that makes him a iGEMer.                     Probably the aspiration to do research and the curiosity in life science. He likes traveling                     , sleeping, collecting cigarette case(it’s the searching that thrills me).
Jin                         Wanlin
Electronic Engineering, Senior
"It doesn't matter where you came from. What matters is who you choose to be."
She loves both computer sciences and life sciences and that’s one of the reasons why she joined                     the team. She focused on the design of the circuits which combine biological and electronics                     design, as well as the automation of genetic design. She enjoys being a team member of Peking iGEM                     very much.

"Plunge into the unknown."
I’m great at photography, graphic design, and singing. It’s always thrilling for me to push my                     limits                     and here I am. Synthetic biology is a wonderland, and iGEM is the rabbit hole. It’s full of bizarre                     yet intriguing matters remained to be solved.
Su Rui
Internship
My name is Rui Su, a High School Senior in United States. Attracted by the charm of synthetic                         and biology, I am planning to major in Life Sciences. People find me to be an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent communication skills. My hobbies are playing piano and                         running.
