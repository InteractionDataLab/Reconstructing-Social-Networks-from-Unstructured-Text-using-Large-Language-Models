Co-oraganize CCiC
From August 26th to 29th, our team held the 4th Conference of the China iGEMer Community (CCiC) as             the co-organizer in FAFU. Our instructors, Lou Chunbo and Zhang Haoqian both gave talks during the opening             ceremony. They shared their iGEM experiences, raised some problems faced by iGEM and synthetic biology, and             encouraged us to work more and try to deal with them. Two members of our team attended the conference and             performed well in the presentation and poster section. Additionally, our members gave a special talk about             the Synbio Wiki (know more in Human Practice session) initiated this year by our team, which received a great response.             Through the four-day communication with other teams, we got a lot of excellent suggestions about our project             and SynbioWiki, and gave some help to them, too.

Interact With Undergraduate Teams
As the host, our team communicated with quite a lot of undergraduate teams from China during the             competition.
In June, our team instructor visited and communicated with SCAU, SYSU, SCUT, TJU and TUST. During                     the meeting, we exchanged our project ideas with them, and as one of the first iGEM teams in China,                     Peking iGEM is also taking on a responsibility to help and guide other young contestants.

Interacting with Team TUST
During the summer vacation, our team held symposiums with OUC-China and HZAU respectively, and had                     lively discussions about our project, experiments and team management. We helped the HZAU team to                     contact Dr. Luo Chunxiong to help them get support in microfluidics. With OUC-China we keep a                     long-term communication and have had several discussions, which benefited both of us a lot.

Symposium with HZAU
On 6th August, our team leader had a face-to-face conversation with a member from XMU and talked                     quite a lot about the foundation, organization and management of an iGEM team, in which we both                     gave some valuable advice to each other.

In June, our instructor presented the Peking iGEM at the Asian Leader Workshop held by the Hong Kong                     University of Science and Technology. He had deep discussions with a number of other Asian teams                     there.
Mentor High School Teams
This year, we mentored a high-school team, BNDS China, from July to October. We offered them not only             guidance in fundamental molecular laboratory operations, but also experimental materials such as the             expression vector for Repressor Generator, and corresponding primers, as well as all enzymes and laboratory             equipment.

Additionally, we had several face-to-face discussions with other high-school teams, such as RDFZ-China, SDSZ, and HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou, helping them to design their projects.

During the 4th CCiC, we found out that SCU-China is also using a repressilator in their project. We             therefore started in-depth communication from then on. As they faced some difficulties in knocking out the clpXP operon of E. coli, we offered them the E. coli DHL708 Î”clpXP strain,             which was a kind gift from Jahan Paulsson. SCU-China also gave us some valuable suggestions and help in             testing the mutant strains.
