LI Yulong mainly focused on the overall operating of the team. In experiment, he took part in the testing and modification for repressilator, construction of parts and their submission.  He was also involved in the Synbio Wiki construction and promotion, team interaction, academic communication and human practice. He joined the presentation slides designing and gave the presentation as one of the speakers.
JIN Wanlin was mainly responsible for the theoretical design of our project and she also developed the software RASSD for our project. She built our Synbio Wiki as one of the main builders with the help of other team members. She was also responsible for the presentation slides designing as one of the speakers who give presentation.
FU Zhehan was mainly devoted in modeling and simulation of our project. He was also one of the speakers who give presentation and joined the presentation designing. And he helped other team members to correct almost every part of the wiki text.
DONG Ziqi was mainly devoted to the laboratory management and experiment design. He was responsible for constructing the integrase and excisionase expression systems and building the RBS library for recombinases. Besides the work of fine-tuning the efficiency of recombinases, he also led the construction of bio-flip-flop. He also helped to write corresponding wiki text and upload part information to Part Registry.
ZHU Wentao was our main web designer, who built the Synbio Wiki with the help of JIN Wanlin. The architecture and design of our team wiki were also completed by him. He helped to do graphic designing of user interface in our software. He also instructed other team members to upload wiki contents and gave some suggestions and important help about the presentation and theoretical design of our project.
WANG Yichen mainly focused on the constructing the integrase and excisionase expression systems,building the RBS library for recombinases and constructing the bio-flip-flop.Besides, she is responsible for data processing and analysis in this part of experiments. She also contributed to wiki about flip-flop and parts registration.
QIU Jianhui was the first one to put forward the original idea of our project. And he mainly devoted in the characterization of terminators and the constructing of our control circuit to realize the 1→2→3 fluorescence transition display and “2017”→“PKU”transition  in experiment. He also wrote the wiki contents about corresponding part and uploaded part information to Part Registry.
CHEN Bingrong mainly focused on the characterization of recombinases, the construction and test of our frequency divider device _flip-flop and the writing of corresponding wiki text. He was responsible for the financial management of our team and instructed other members to go through the formalities about going abroad. And he also helped to upload the wiki contents and part information.
ZHANG Songyuan was mainly responsible for the characterization of terminators and the constructing of our control circuit to realize the "1→2→3" fluorescence transition in Biological Seven-Segment Display and “2017”→“PKU”transition  in experiment. And he also wrote the wiki contents about corresponding part and uploaded part information to Part Registry.. Besides, he was in charge of financial management of our team and the operation of our iGEM club in PKU.
WANG Chuchen was responsible for the graphic design about our project and helped other members to make the experimental images. He also worked on designing and manufacture of the hardware “Autosnap”. Besides, he helped to test and modify the repressilator,   manufacture microfluidic chips and upload the wiki contents.
LU Wei was concentrating the testing and modification of repressilator. And he was mainly responsible for the using of fluorescence microscope and manufacture of microfluidic chips. He wrote the main part of wiki content about corresponding part.
FAN Birao mainly focused on the characterization of recombinases, the construction and test of our frequency divider device _flip-flop and the writing of corresponding wiki text. And she also helped to upload the wiki contents and part information.
CHEN Hong was responsible for the interlab. And she was also devoted to the part construction, submission and information uploading.
XU Yuanwei helped to do some work about human practice and terminator characterization. She also helped to correct and improve the text of wiki and the graphic design.
