Human Practices Silver
In order to explore the influence our project may bring about, we mainly carried out our work concentrating on three aspects:
To consider the potential and limitations of our project, we interviewed two experts in their respective domains, Dr. Wei Ping from the center of quantitative biology and Prof. Chen Jiang from the Institute of Advanced Communications.( See Details )
We visited two distinguished synthetic biology companies in China, SynBioTech and Bluepha, trying to determine the social issues behind a novel synbio product and the application of sequential logic in cell programming.( See Details )
We constructed SynBioWiki, a wiki-based encyclopedia exclusively for synthetic biology, as well as an open idea-sharing community with active social functions based on this website. We exchanged opinions on several topics with others.( See Details )
