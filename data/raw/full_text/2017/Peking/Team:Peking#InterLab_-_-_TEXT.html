The Peking iGEM 2017 team is participating in the Fourth InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic             biology, along with teams from around the world. We introduced eight plasmids into E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha             and measured the GFP expression levels using a plate reader.
Introduction
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component of synthetic biology. However, there have been few             opportunities to repeat the same measurements in different labs. In order to quantify the degree of             variability exhibited by engineered genetic constructs across different laboratories, the measurement             committee invited all iGEM teams to participate in the Interlab study, which provides researchers with a             detailed protocol and data analysis form, with the aim to produce common, comparable units for measuring GFP             on different plate readers.

Reagent
1ml LUDOX
ddH2O
Fluorescein
10ml 1xPBS
Instruments
Pipettes
96-well plate
50 ml Falcon tube (or equivalent, preferably amber or covered in foil to block light)
1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes for sample storage, ice bucket with ice
Methods
At first, we used LUDOX-S40 as a single-point reference to obtain a ratiometric conversion factor to             transform our absorbance readings into standard OD600 data. Simultaneously, the ratiometric conversion factor accounts for instrument differences.
Secondly, we generated a standard curve of fluorescence as a function of fluorescein concentration. We can thus use the standard curve to convert the fluorescence of GFP into a concentration of GFP.
Last and most importantly, we measured the A600 and fluorescence of green fluorescent protein. The GFP is used as a measurement marker of promoter activity, and the fluorescence/OD600 ratio is used to give an adjustment of the relative expression per cell. Furthermore, we tested some RBS devices that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable.
