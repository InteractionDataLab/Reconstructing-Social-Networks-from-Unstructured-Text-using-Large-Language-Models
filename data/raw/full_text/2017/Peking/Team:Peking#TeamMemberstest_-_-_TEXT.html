"You can't cheat the process."
Synthetic biology is cool and the time in lab is always attracting me so much. So I 'm willing to                         devote my time and energy to iGEM and synthetic biology. As the leader, I concern, organize and                         coordinate everything in our team. Of course, there is a division of labor and I mainly focus on                         two parts: biological experiments and human practice.

"Life is fantastic."
I will become a doctor in the not far distant future and I hold the point that the synthetic                         biology is useful in many fields of medicine, which is why I do my best to become an iGEMer. I                         just keep arming pull in the team. And my hobby is to prepare pipette tips and reading. I really                         enjoy iGEM.
