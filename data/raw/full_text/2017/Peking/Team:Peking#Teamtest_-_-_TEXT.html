"You can't cheat the process."
Synthetic biology is cool and the time in lab is always attracting me so much. So I 'm willing to                     devote my time and energy to iGEM and synthetic biology. As the leader, I concern, organize and                     coordinate everything in our team. Of course, there is a division of labor and I mainly focus on                     two parts: biological experiments and human practice.

"Life is fantastic."
I will become a doctor in the not far distant future and I hold the point that the synthetic                     biology is useful in many fields of medicine, which is why I do my best to become an iGEMer. I                     just keep arming pull in the team. And my hobby is to prepare pipette tips and reading. I really                     enjoy iGEM.

"Only the paranoid survive."
Working as director of modeling and data analytics for the team, Friedrich Fu views iGEM as                         a capstone design for an undergraduate aiming at Life Computing. His current work involves                         basic computational methods in theoretical neuroscience. He views the biological challenges                         with a data science perspective.
