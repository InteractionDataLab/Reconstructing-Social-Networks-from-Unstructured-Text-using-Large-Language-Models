Contribution
This year, Peking iGEM parcitipated in the Fourth InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology, along with teams around the world. And we also improved the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part BBa_K1132010 and submitted the improved part BBa_K2243000 .
InterLab
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component of synthetic biology. However, there have been few opportunities to repeat the same measurements in different labs. In order to quantify the degree of variability exhibited by engineered genetic constructs across different laboratories, the measurement committee invited all iGEM teams to participate in the Interlab study, which provides researchers with a detailed protocol and data analysis form, with the aim to produce common, comparable units for measuring GFP on different plate readers.                         We introduced the required eight plasmids into E. coli K-12 DH5-alpha, measured the GFP expression levels using a plate reader, submitted the results on time and display them on InterLab Page.
Part improvement
TP901-1 integrase is widely used according to literature research, but the quantitative information of this part( BBa_K1132010 ) is very limited. This year we hope to use the integrase to control the direction of other biological parts, thus influencing the function of the cells.                         So we have characterized it using different promoters and RBSes. Through the tuning procedure, we can express TP901-1 integrase well and invert DNA efficiently.(See BBa_K2243000 for details)
