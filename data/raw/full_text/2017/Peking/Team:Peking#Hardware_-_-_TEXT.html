Microfluidics
Microfluidics devices are applied to deal with flow of liquid inside micrometer-sized channels, and conduct             continuous observation under fluorescence microscopy. This year, we designed two microfluidic chips:  a             sand-clock chip and a seven-segment display chip. The sand-clock microfluidic device is a "mother machine",             which consists of dozens of thin channels holding single cells, and can be used to track individual cell             line for generations. And for the seven-segment display chip, cells were kept in chambers to observe             fluorescence changes.

Autosnap
To demonstrate the functionality of our genetic circuit, Peking iGEM 2017 team have designed an independent and affordable device for the observation of colonies or 96-well plates which can             automatically capture and save digital pictures of colonies according to the pattern.We additionally add LED lights and filters for fluorescence observation.
