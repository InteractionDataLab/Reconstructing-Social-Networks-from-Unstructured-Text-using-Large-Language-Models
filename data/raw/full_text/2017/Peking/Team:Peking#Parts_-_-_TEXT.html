Overview
Members of Peking iGEM 2017 team devoted themselves to constructing a part library related to recombinases. We have not only submitted 5 basic parts consisting of improved recombinases and recombinase-RDF fusion proteins, but also provided 31 composite parts including a series of unidirectional terminators flanked by attB/P sites and some well-performed constructs to express or report recombinases.
Functions of all the parts were tested and validated both in controlled laboratory condition and in normal condition. They can be used as powerful tools for other iGEM teams.idirectional terminators flanked by recombination sites.

Properties
Introduction
This year, our team has selected a series of recombinases through literature searches and                         characterized a number of them. Here we present the best characterized recombinase - Bxb1 gp35                         ( BBa_K2243012 ) as our best basic part for the                         award.
With well-behaved inversion performance, Bxb1 gp35 can invert the target DNA sequence                         efficiently, thus changing the function of the circuit according to our demands, and can be                         designed and used by other iGEM teams in their project/research.

How we characterized and improved the part
Using our standard approach to characterize recombinases (Figure 1), we selected two different                         vectors and a series of RBS to express Bxb1 to invert the constitutive promoter BBa_J23119 and                         change the fluorescence. Through the screening procedure, we improved the performance of Bxb1                         gp35 and obtained a number of well-behaved matches, among which Bxb1 gp35 recombinase works                         particularly well. (See more in Flip-flop )
Properties
Through the fine tuning, we improved the performance of Bxb1 gp35 efficiently. Here we present                         some of the well-tested behaviors of this recom-binase, which indicates the excellent properties                         of Bxb1 gp35.
High efficiency of inversion under most conditions
Whether with computer-designed RBS or widely used RBS from the iGEM registry, Bxb1 exhibited a                         relatively high efficiency in inverting the target promoter.
Low leakage through tuning
Through our tuning procedure and exhaustive characterization, we ob-tained a series of response                         curves to the concentration of inducer, in which relatively low leakage (no inducer) and high                         inversion efficiency (proper in-ducer concentration) were found. This property meets our                         requirements well, indicating that Bxb1 gp35 can change the DNA accurately according to our                         needs.
Potential for controlling the downstream circuit
In addition to inverting the promoter to change the gene expression, we also used the improved                         Bxb1 expression plasmid to invert a unidirectional terminator (See more in controller ), thus                         opening or closing the expression of a downstream reporter gene.

Best Composite Part
Our team constructed many composite parts for the expression of the reporter and the                         recombinase. Here we present a list of them, and introduce the best-performing part: Bxb1 attB_ ECK120034435F_Bxb1 attP , as our best composite part.(See more in controller )
Function of Bxb1 attB_ECK120034435_Bxb1 attP
Figure 1. Schematic of the Bxb1 attB_ECK120034435_Bxb1 attP composite part as integrated                             into                             the GFP expression plasmid.
Our best composite part consists of the Bxb1 gp35's target sites attB/attP and one well-behaved                         unidirectional terminator (ECK120034435) between them. This construct can be regarded as an                         outstanding biological switch for RNA polymerase, because of its high ratio between forward                         and reverse terminator strength. What's more, we can express Bxb1 gp35 to change the direction                         of the terminator and switch on/off the expression of downstream genes.
Excellent performance
High ratio between forward and reverse terminator strength. (Over 1000-fold)
The terminator ECK120034435 is the best-performing unidirectional terminator in our library,                         and its Ts ratio is higher than 1000-fold, which indicates that it can potentially be used as                         an RNAP switch in our circuit.
No latent reactivity to transcription.
Unlike some other terminators we observed and characterized, ECK120034435 has no latent                         promoter reactivity under most conditions, and won't start transcription even if ligated with recombinase reaction sites. Thus, this terminator can be used as our controller to improve the                         predictability of our constructed circuit.
Robustness under different conditions.
When we introduced one or two pairs of attB/P sites on both sides of ECK120034435 to construct                         the controller that can be inverted by recombinase, the great performance of this                         unidirectional terminator was robust. This property shows its potential utility in constructing                         more complex control circuits in our sequential logic circuitry.
Ability to control expression through the recombinase.
With the excellent performance in opening/closing the transcription process, we have proved                         that our best composite part can be inverted by Bxb1 gp35 to obviously change the GFP                         expression, which shows that this construct is potentially a great control unit for gene                         expression under the control of recombinases.

Part Collection
Members of Peking iGEM 2017 team devoted themselves to constructing a part library of                         unidirectional terminators flanked by recombination sites.
This construct can be regarded as one outstanding biological switch to RNA polymerase because of                         its high ratio between forward and reverse Terminator Strength (Ts). What's more, we can express                         the corresponding recombinase to change the direction of terminator and switch on/off the gene                         expression downstream.
The collection of parts mostly has good performance and can be improved further. Their Ts ratios                         are relatively high (some even higher than 1000 folds), which indicates that they can be used as                         great RNAP switches in our circuit potentially. Some of them have robustness even when ligated                         with attB/P sites and we have observed obvious inversion through the expression of recombinase                         which indicates the usability to control the expression through recombinase.

Improvement
Improvement of TP901-1
Improvement of Bxb1 gp35
Improvement of phi31 Integrase
Though there are already many recombinase parts in the iGEM registry, quantitative                         characterization data on them is very limited, and what's more, there is no single standard                         characterization method for serine recombinases. In addition, even though the attL/R sites                         formed by the recom-binase inversion are not recognized by the recombinases which create them,                         we successfully achieved the "reset" process using fusions of the recombinases and their                         recombination directionality factors (RDF).
Improvement of TP901-1
The submitted TP901-1 integrase part( BBa_K1132010 ) in the iGEM registry only consists of a brief introduction to it. The only data for                         TP901-1 was obtained through the dimerization of split integrase, which did not work so well.                         Additionally, there appears to be no quantitative information to evaluate the RDF of                         TP901-1.
This year we submitted the TP901-1 ( BBa_K2243000 ) coding region as a basic part, and obtained                         detailed data to evaluate the inversion efficiency of TP901-1 integrase with different RBSs and                         vectors through our standard characterization method. This opens the possibility to tune and                         improve its performance further to meet our design requirements.
We also used our composite part BBa_K2243035 , comprising the unidirec-tional terminator                         ECK120034435 flanked by attB/P sites, as the reporter to evaluate the performance of TP901-1,                         which broadens the prospects to use TP901-1 to control gene expression.
We also constructed the fusion protein BBa_K2243014 , comprising TP901-1 integrase and its                         RDF( BBa_K1733000 ), and tested its ability to invert DNA through attL/R sites.                         (See more in Flip-flop )
Improvement of Bxb1 gp35
Some characterization data of Bxb1 gp35 ( BBa_K907000 ) is already available in the iGEM registry,                         but it is still limited because the RBS plays a significant role in recombinase expression and                         performance according to our modelling and observations. Without proper RBSs, Bxb1 may exhibit                         very high leaky expression (even approaching the induced expression level).
This year, our team constructed an RBS library to improve the efficiency of Bxb1 gp35( BBa_K2243012 ). We                         obtained a number of well-behaved matches (from BBa_K2243002-BBa_K2243005), and measured their                         corresponding transfer curves against the concentration of inducer. Through our improvements,                         Bxb1 showed a very high efficiency of nearly 95% and low leakage of inversion.
Additionally, we used our composite parts ( BBa_K2243023 and BBa_K2243024 ), comprising the                         unidirectional terminator ECK120034435 flanked by attB/P sites as the reporter to evaluate                         the performance of Bxb1 gp35, which broadens the prospects to use Bxb1 to control gene                         expres-sion.
Finally, we fused Bxb1 gp47 ( BBa_K907001 ) with Bxb1 gp35 and tested the ability of this fusion protein ( BBa_K2243013 ) to invert the                         DNA sequence flanked by its specific attL/R sites.
Improvement of phi31 Integrase
Though there are quite a few parts related to phiC31 integrase, there is no systematic standard                         characterization of it. The only relevant information we found comprises fluorescent images                         that show the performance of phiC31 in plants, which is not quantitative and accurate.
Our team used our standard reporter ( BBa_K2243008 ) to characterize phiC31, and selected a few                         well-behaved phiC31 translational units which can achieve very high inversion efficiencies with                         low leakage. Through these data, we will be able to make use of phiC31 in our future designs                         more efficiently and accurately. Additionally, we used our composite part ( BBa_K2243031 ),                         consisting of the unidirectional terminator ECK120034435 flanked by attB/P sites, as the                         reporter to evaluate the per-formance of Bxb1 gp35, which broadens the prospects to use Bxb1                         to con-trol gene expression.
