Transformation
↓
Carried out on ice and by open flame, unless otherwise specified.
Add 3µl DNA to a microcentrifuge tube containing 50µl competent E. coli.
Ice for 20 minutes, followed by a 90 second heat shock in a water bath at 42˚C.
Return tubes to ice for 2 minutes.
Add 800µl SOC or LB broth.
Incubate on a shaker at 220 rpm and 37˚C for one hour.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm and discard 700µl of the supernatant.
Carefully resuspend the pellet and plate on agar containing the appropriate antibiotics. Spread gently using a glass spreader.
Incubate overnight (16 hours) at 37˚C.
Ligation
↓
This protocol was modified from the iGEM Ligation protocol All materials are kept on ice unless otherwise stated.
Add the following reagents to a PCR tube:
2µL of digested plasmid backbone
equimolar amount of EcoRI-HF SpeI digested fragment (< 3µL)
equimolar amount of XbaI PstI digested fragment (< 3µl)
1µL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1µL T4 DNA ligase
ddH2O until a total reaction volume of 20 µL
Incubate the ligation reaction at 4˚C overnight.
Transform with 3µL of product.
Restriction Double Digest
↓
This protocol was modified from the iGEM Restriction Digest protocol All materials are kept on ice unless otherwise stated.
Add the following reagents to a PCR tube:
150 ng of DNA to be digested (~3µL)
5µL of NEBuffer 2.1
1µL of the first enzyme (e.g. EcoRI-HF)
1µL of the second enzyme (e.g. PstI)
ddH2O until a total reaction volume of 20µL
Mix well and spin down briefly.
Incubate the restriction digest at 37C for 1 hour, and then 65C for 10 min to heat kill the enzymes in a thermal cycler with a heated lid.
Run a portion of the digest on a gel (5µl) to check that both plasmid backbone and part length are accurate.
Insertion into pJET blunt cloning vector
↓
Insertion into pJET1.2 blunt cloning vector optimized protocol for Thermo Scientific CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit.
Run PCR on the gene of interest to approximately to obtain a DNA concentration of 500ng/µl.
The blunting reaction is setup on ice and composed of 10µl 2X Reaction Buffer, 500ng PCR product, 1µl DNA Blunting Enzyme and nuclease-free water up to 17µl. The reaction should be vortexed and centrifuged for 3-5 seconds and kept on ice.
Incubate the mixture at 70˚C for 5 minutes. Chill on ice.
The ligation reaction is setup on ice and composed of 1µl pJET1.2/blunt Cloning Vector and 1µl T4 DNA Ligase. This reaction should be added to the mixture from the previous steps. The reaction should be vortexed and centrifuged for 3-5 seconds.
Incubate the ligation mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Transform the ligated mixture using the transformation protocol.
Inoculation
↓
For any flask used, ensure that there is enough space to properly aerate the bacteria.
In a 15mL culture tube, add 5mL LB broth.
Using a sterile pipette tip, select a colony and drop it into the culture tube. Be careful not to let it hit the sides.
Loosely cap and incubate on a shaker at 220 rpm and 37˚C overnight (16 hours).
Glycerol Stock
↓
This is used for long-term bacterial storage and does not require re-transformation to obtain necessary cultures.
Add 700µl of the inoculated cultures to 300µl of 50% glycerol in a microcentrifuge tube.
Mix by inversion 4-6 times.
Store at -80˚C.
To plate, use a sterile pipette tip and scratch the surface of the stock and streak onto agar with appropriate antibiotics.
Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
↓
A more sensitive technique similar to Polymerase Chain Reaction. Control samples should be prepared carefully, as cross-contamination easily occurs due to the high sensitivity of LAMP. The following is the recipe for a 25µl reaction.
A set of 4 or 6 primers were designed using PrimerExplorer .
Make a stock containing Isothermal MasterMix and 20pmol inner primers and 5pmol outer primers.
Add 5µl DNA for amplification to 20µl stock.
PCR tubes should be placed in a thermocycler for 20 minutes at 65˚C.
The reaction can be stopped by placing the tubes on ice and visualized using 1X SYBR Green dye or any other appropriate dye.
