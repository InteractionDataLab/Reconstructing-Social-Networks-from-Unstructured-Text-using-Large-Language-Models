Postcard Campaign
Virtual Conference
Surveys
We participated in DÃ¼sseldorf Cologne postcard campaign in which we designed a postcard combining the Abu Dhabi skyline and the LAMP reaction that is integral to our project. We wrote a small description of our project on the back, and the postcards were distributed to all participating teams from around the world.         Therefore, STEC-illnesses are still a major problem in countries that revolve around street food.
Groningen
Groningen iGEM team participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to build a phage detection for Lactococcus lactis, but were having trouble with the BioBrick 3A assembly and building their device. We suggested that they try using the pJET vector for transformation and implementing a valving system in their device. For the GFP amplification issues they were facing, team Vilnius-Lithuania suggested that they express transcription factors that can bind to multiple sequences at a time to amplify their signal.
Vilnius-Lithuania
Vilnius-Lithuania iGEM team participated in our virtual conference, and both the initial call and the follow-up calls were successful. Their project was to have a synthetic replicant to effectively keep different plasmids in one cell with the ability to control the copy number of each plasmid group separately. We looked into the issue of calculating copy number, while they helped us look at our microfluidic chambers.
We participated in the following surveys:
The microfluidics survey for Boston University Hardware.
The cholera survey for INSA-UPS Toulouse.
The cattle survey for University Nebraska-Lincoln.
The air pollution survey for Pasteur Paris.
The GM medicine survey for Cardiff University.
The insulin accessibility survey for University of Sydney.
The psicose survey for Evry Paris-Saclay.
The diagnosis device survey for Munich.
The perspectives on treatments for illness survey for Columbia NY.
