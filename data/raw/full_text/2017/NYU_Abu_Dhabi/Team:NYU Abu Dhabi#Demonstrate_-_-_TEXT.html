We have demonstrated that our device works through three separate proofs of concept . We have shown that our device has been able to detect our gene of interest, rfbE ( BBa_K2495001 ), as well as a genomic target for Plasmodium falciparum. Feedback from our target audiences has indicated that our prototype is 1) functional and 2) appropriate for its designated use and audience, as it is portable, simple and does not require any laboratory equipment. The instructions specified in the video are provided below:
The provided kit contains all you need for rapid detection of shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Inside you'll find:
A cotton swab
2 disposable Pasteur Pipettes
2 solutions labelled "S" (for sample) and "C" (for control)
A PDMS chip
A small sheet of optical adhesive
To use the device simply follow the remaining steps:
Insert the USB into any portable battery pack or into a USB-to-wall adaptor to begin warming the device.
Swab your food sample using the provided cotton swab and swirl it into the solution labelled "S".
Place the provided PDMS chip with the wells open towards you.
In the wells labelled "+" and "-", add the solution from the tube labelled "C" using one of the pipettes. Make sure to add enough volume to fill each well.
Taking the clean pipette, add your solution from the tube labelled "S" to the remaining wells.
Seal the top of the PDMS plate using the provided optical adhesive.
Insert the lid back onto the device and wait for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, you results are ready for visualization.
If your samples are brighter than the well marked "-", your samples may be contaminated by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and we suggest discarding them.
