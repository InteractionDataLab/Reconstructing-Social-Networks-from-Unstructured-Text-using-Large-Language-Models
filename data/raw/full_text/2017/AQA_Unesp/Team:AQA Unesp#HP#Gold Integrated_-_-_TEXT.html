informative
Dealing with information about type 1 diabetes and talking with patients about how they were instructed to live with this disease when they discovered it, we realized that a lot of information is transmitted superficially or insufficiently to help the patient maintain his quality of life. Therefore, we created an informative banner to inform not only patients, but also the general community about some basic informations that are essential and often do not reach diabetes patients and their families. They are:
the difference between the main types of diabetes (type 1 and 2);
the type of health professionals are indicate for the patients;
the importance of glycemic control and how it can be done;
step by step of how to do the carbohydrate count;
the main types of insulin and how to give the injections;
availability of drugs through the Brazilian basic health system;
the main symptoms of diabetes;
the importance to treat the disease.
Although we didn't have much time to receive feedback from the public about the impact of the informative, we got opinions from people involved with the disease, such as researchers and patients. The evaluation of the content on the banner was excellent, indicating that we will somehow collaborate to improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes.
documentary
One of the main goals in our human practices activities was to understand the routine of people with type 1 diabetes, the difficulties faced when they discovered the disease and difficulties related to the treatment available. Due to this, we interviewed diabetic people with questions about their day to day and the lack of information they experienced when they were diagnosed with the disease. We understand that new treatments are important to improve the quality life of diabetic people, making the treatment less invasive, cheaper and more accessible than the current ones. Watch the documentary below for a full comprehension of the type 1 diabetic patient's routine (English subtitles available).
