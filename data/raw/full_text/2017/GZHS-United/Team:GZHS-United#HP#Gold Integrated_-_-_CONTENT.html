Integrated</H1><H2 id="Investigation">Investigation</H2><H3>Survey on Mosquito Eradication</H3><P>Since we have started our entrepreneurship project, in order to improve our product and investigate the possible market acceptance of it, we designed a questionnaire about people’s opinion on mosquito eradication, mosquito controlling products and technological innovation in the field of mosquito control. </P><H4>Main contents</H4><P><B>Question 1:</B> do you use mosquito eradication products?</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>81.46% of the respondents use mosquito eradication products, indicates that mosquito eradication products are well accepted by the public and the market is huge. </P><P><B>Question 3:</B> do you pay attention to new innovative mosquito eradication products?</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>16.56% of the respondents always pay attention to new mosquito eradication products and 55.96% of them do it sometimes. These data indicate that new mosquito eradication products, like the product of ours, could be noticed by the public and have the potential to access to market. </P><P><B>Question 8:</B>what do you think are the deficiencies of mosquito control products in the market?</P><P><B>Analysis: </B></P><P>Due to the results from question 8, inefficiency, inconvenience and less in variety are the three main problems of mosquito control products in the market. Therefore, in order to get the product of ours accepted by the market and public, we have to improve its efficiency and convenience.</P><P><B>Question 10:</B> what’s your attitude towards the advancement of mosquito control technologies in the future?</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>55.3% of the respondents are expecting new and more advanced mosquito control products, which indicates that the product of ours could be accepted by the public as a new measure of mosquito control if it’s advanced enough. </P><H3>GMO Survey</H3><P>It is undeniable that the product of ours is an outcome of several genetic modification processes. In order to make our human practices more influential, and to make our product more widely accepted, we have to get a clue of how the public understand GMO and synthetic biology. </P><H4>Main Content</H4><P><B>Question 1:</B> how much do you know about GMO？</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>79.61% (9.92% + 69.69%) of the respondents know GMO and 20.11% have heard of it, while only 0.28% of the respondents know nothing about GMO. These data indicate that GM technology is known and accepted by most of the respondents. </P><P><B>Question 2:</B> Which one (or more than one) of the followings might be GM products found in the Chinese market?</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>This is a test about respondents’ knowledge on GMO. Except for maize, all of the products in the list could be GMO or GM products in China, but the number of volts for maize is the second highest (90.65%), and most people don't believe that cottons, beets, tobaccos, ppapaya and insulin could be GMO or produced by GMO. This suggests that the majority of the respondents are lacking of knowledge about GM technology and GMO. </P><P><B>Question 3:</B> in what way do you think GMO could influence people’s health?</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>44.19% of the respondents believe that GMO is potentially harmful (meanwhile not beneficial at all) to human health, while 30.88% believe that GMO could bring both benefits and harm to human health. Which means the respondents were not fully informed about the truth of GMO, some of them don't know the benefits GMO could bring, and the others cannot hold a certain attitude on it. Therefore, it is our job to inform as much people as possible about the facts about GMO.</P><P><B>Question 8:</B> What’s your attitude toward the researches in the field of transgenosis?</P><P><B>Analysis:</B></P><P>74.22% of the respondents support further researches in the field of transgenosis, which means transgenosis and GMO have the potential to be accepted by the majority of the public and the public wants to know more about GMO. </P><H2>Leaflet Making</H2><P>We made two leaflets that were used as educational and popularizational materials, on the two main focuses of our program, GMO and mosquito control. We recalled the concerns and questions of ours at the time we first met the issue of GMO and mosquito control. We combined these questions (which were solved during our learning in the lectures and extra courses) with the results of our questionnaire investigation, to design the contents of our leaflets.</P><P>GMO Leaflet</P><UL><LI>What is GMO</LI><LI>Market share</LI><LI>Applications</LI><LI>GM procedure and safety evaluation</LI><LI>Chinese policies on GMO</LI><LI>How GM technology solves practical problems</LI><LI>Market demand</LI><LI>FAQs</LI></UL><P>Mosquito Control Leaflet</P><UL><LI>Introduction of mosquito</LI><LI>Trivia about mosquito</LI><LI>Mosquito borne diseases</LI><LI>Mosquito eradication methods</LI><LI>Mosquito repelling methods</LI></UL><H2>Comprehensive Evaluation</H2><H3>Health</H3><P>Reduce the possibility of people being infected with mosquito-borne infectious diseases like cholera and dengue, decrease death rate and reduce pressure on the medical system; therefore, more resources available for the treatment of other diseases. </P><P>Decrease death rate.</P><P>Antibiotic resistant genes used as markers in the lab might drift to other microbes, increasing the resistance of microbes toward antibiotics, reducing the effectiveness of antibiotic treatments. </P><H3>Environment</H3><P>Mosquito larvae might develop drug resistance toward Mtx1 and Cry4Ba, making it more difficult to work effectively, making many now available mosquito larvae killing products invalid. </P><P>Numerous of species occupy the same ecological niche as mosquitos, when the population of mosquitos is controlled, the predators that prey on mosquitos could choose other species to eat; therefore, the control of mosquito won’t affect the ecosystem. </P><H3>Economic &amp; Social</H3><P>The presence of the product of ours in the market may reinforce the competition and bring pressure to other companies which product mosquito eradication products, and if we became dominant in the market, deployment issues in other companies.  </P><P>After mosquitos are controlled, funds on mosquito control could be used in other more meaningful fields, like education, environmental protection and researches.</P><H2>Risk Assessment</H2><P>We used E. coli, a widely used non-pathogenic model organism, as our bioreactor to produce proteins Mtx1 and Cry4Ba. However, since we hope the product of ours could be put on the market, which means it would be distributed into the natural environment, we have to be sure that it is safe for everything except mosquito larvae. </P><P> We have thought about several problems that might occur, mainly from the aspects of environment and human health.</P><P> Antibiotic marker genes used in the lab might drift to other microbes, increasing the resistance of microbes toward antibiotics, reducing the effectiveness of antibiotic treatments. In order to reduce the genetic drift, we have conducted an entire set of strict lab rules and waste dispersal procedures to prevent any departure of living cells from the lab, therefore, prevent the drift of genes from our lab to the natural environment.</P><H2>Professional Bodies</H2><P>We have communicated with Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention for data related with mosquito density and dengue fever in Guangzhou, then joined their team for a field research in a dengue fever epidemic area. During the communication and field research, we got to know that the majority of normal people are lacking of knowledge about proper ways to control mosquitos. Through the field research, our team members discovered a highly efficient way to control the overflow of mosquitos, which is to control the mosquito larvae, and this is the reason why we designed our product to eradicate mosquito larvae. </P><H2>Our Posters and Leaflets</H2><H3>Posters we designed for public education about GMO:</H3><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/2/2d/GZHS-United_Poster_Brief_Introduction_to_GMO.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Brief Introduction to GMO.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/1/10/GZHS-United_Poster_History_of_GMO.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_History of GMO.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/e/ea/GZHS-United_Poster_Misunderstandings_about_GMO.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Misunderstandings about GMO.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/f/f5/GZHS-United_Poster_Policies_in_China_about_GMO.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Policies in China about GMO.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/3/3f/GZHS-United_Poster_Process_of_Gene_Editing.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Process of Gene Editing.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/0/0c/GZHS-United_Poster_Pros_and_Cons_of_GMO.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Pros and Cons of GMO.pdf</A></P><H3>Posters we designed for public education about mosquito control:</H3><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/a/aa/GZHS-United_Poster_Basic_Knowledge_about_Mosquitos.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Basic Knowledge about Mosquitos.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/File:GZHS-United_Poster_Mosquito-borne_Diseases.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Mosquito-borne Diseases.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/e/e7/GZHS-United_Poster_Mosquito_Control_Guide_for_Public.pdf">GZHS-United_Poster_Mosquito Control Guide for Public.pdf</A></P><H3>Leaflets of ours:</H3><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/6/6a/GZHS-United_Leaflet_GMO.pdf">GZHS-United_Leaflet_GMO.pdf</A></P><P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/75/GZHS-United_Leaflet_Mosquito_Control.pdf">GZHS-United_Leaflet_Mosquito Control.pdf</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
