Safety design in our project:
Products:  Cell free product , containing purified proteins , cat foods and agarose , therefore no risk of mutation, gene flow or other hazards associate with living cells.
Bio-chasis: E.coli,the most commonly used bio-chasis in genetic engineering,  pathogenic free.
Proteins: Cry4Ba and Mtx1 which were synthesized in our experiment specificly target mosquito larvae , harming neither plant nor mammals.
Resistance: Using a chemical as pesticide is risky, for mosquito can easily develop resistance to this pesticide. Biopesticide can impose a lower selective pressure in mosquito so mosquito is less likely to develop resistance.  By combining Cry4Ba and Mtx1 together as bio-pesticide, we can reduce the risk of resistance considerably.
General rules and safety measures
No food or drink in the lab.
Always wearing lab coat, confining long hair and loose clothing. Closed shoes in the lab.
Wear safety goggles and mask while handling with toxic materials and chemicals.
Safe disposal of contaminated wastes under local regulations.
Inactivate all living things before disposal.
Work under proper ventilation only.
All lab materials are kept and used only in the lab.
The feeding areas of larvae must be separated. There was no adult mosquito emerged, only larvae were involved in the experiment.
The biological material we used in the experiment, including bacteria and larvae, must be microwaved so as to kill them before pouring them into the sewer.
Policies and regulations
Material management:
The mosquito eggs we used in the experiment are the lab susceptible strain,which were collect from Foshan in the 1980s andhad been kept in the lab for over 30 years without  exposure to any insecticide.
We kept on monitoring the larvae during the experiment. If mosquito larvae survived to the pupate stage, , we will execute them so as to avoid releasing adult mosquito in our lab.
All the biological materials (including eggs, larvae and pupae) will be micorwaved for at least five minutes before being discarded.
Lab safety course
Members in our team have taken  lab safety courses conducted by Professor Honglei Jin, on safety rules , risks and waste dispersal procedures in the lab. The topics in our safety training include the follow sections:
