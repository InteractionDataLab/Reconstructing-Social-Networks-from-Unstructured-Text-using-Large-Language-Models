1. Background information
Our product is PestiJelly, which is a combination of yeast powder and cat food, agarose and insecticidal proteins. The insecticidal proteins include cry4Ba and Mtx1 , which are extracted from our engineering bacteria. They can effectively kill mosquito larvae, especially larvae of aedes and culex, without bring harm to human. These two mosquitoes are vector for Zika, dengue and epidemic encephalitis type B. Toxic protein can be eaten by larvae through their food and cause damage in their intestinal canal, so we added yeast powder and cat food as bait in the product, and use agarose to embed them and form a " insecticidal jelly ".
We first made a new product promotion scheme. We listed out all the steps in a paper of the things we should do during commercializing our product. After that, we conducted survey to the public and make several phone calls to experts in order to find out suitable places for selling as well as target guests. Through the data we've got from the survey, we succeeded in finding out the staffing needs, product cost, targeted customers and the competition in the market. We can also predict at which stages the products will be accepted by the public. Next, we will set up a complete implementation strategy for our projects evaluating the staff needs, the cost, the target public, the safety measures, and the connections between us and our target consumers.
2. Team member’s introduction
Our team is divided into five sections. The first one will be the merchants department which is in charge by****. He is not only persuasive, but also responsible. He has taken part in the Human Practice and a large amount of experience has been earned. So we believe that he will take good charge of the merchants department. He is going to hand out different types of questionnaires and make a summary of which kind of consumers will be our best guests. The second part will be the marketing department. **** will be responsible for it. This job will need a hard-working person who can spend a lot of vigor and time to make the research of the demand of the markets and make an analysis of it. This step will be really necessary for us to finish this project. So**** will be our best choice. We also need another person to take charge in this part. He will be***. His mission is to make a plan of our products. He will also take part in the decision of the advertisements of the products. The third section is the sales department. His task is to manage the sales of the products and deal with several feedbacks from the customers. *** will be a nice person with this part. Next one will be the logistics department. Obviously, his main task is to allot and transit our productions. There will also be a customer service department which is used for handling the reputation from the costumers and resolve the puzzles raised by them. **** is the person who may finish it really well.
Apart from the departments described above, we also have a department which is actually the most important department to make our business more competitive than our counterparts. That is, the R&D (Research and Development) department. Most of our team members are familiar with biological experiments, and we believe that our R&D department can keep our products advanced.
3. Product’s information
Our product is a ****, which is a combination of yeast powder, car food,  agorose and insecticidal protein. The insecticidal protein is consist of cry4Ba and  Mtx1 , which are extracted from engineering bacteria. They do no harm to human being but play a really mortal role to larva mosquito, especially to those vector which can spread diseases. They make significant influence to Aedes and Culex. Toxic protein need to be eaten by larvae and effect on intestinal canal to kill the larvae, so we add yeast powder and cat food as bait in the product, and use nontoxic coagulator, agorose, as the vector. They are used to embedding yeast powder, cat food and toxic protein, forming as a insecticidal jelly which can kill the larvae.
4. Market analysis
According to the the graph, almost half of our sample sizes are 16-30 years old. 31-45 years old’s are the most part, and we also involve other age groups of people in our research. These indicates that our sample includes different type of people, so this research is generalized and universal.
According to research dada, we can find out that those people who take our questionnaire are interesting in learning more about our product. They also think our product is useful. Only a small part of people consider the product as useless in their daily life. To summarize, the result illustrates that our product is important to modern residents in cities because it can help them to solve many problems in life. Most people think they need to use our product to improve their life quality.
Research shows that almost half of public we surveyed indicated unsatisfactory  with existing products because they think these products have a negative impact on their heath. There are also many people hold a suspect attitude. A small part of people unsatisfied with existing products for other reasons such as brand or price. It is easy to find that people unpleased with the negative impact of health and products’ effect. This illustrates that the existing products will cause bad impact on health and they can’t bring a equal benefit with their price. In addition, we can also find from the result that people feel unsatisfied with the inconvenience brought by existing products. However, our product reach every aspect of people’s expectation. At the same time, since people don’t care so much about the brand of a product, we put the technique in the first place in order to reach people’s demand.
Characteristics of existing products which people are unpleased with
This graph showed different reasons of people’s satisfaction towards existing products. Most of the people feel satisfied with the various types of products and the convenience provided by products. A small number of people feel pleased with the price and other aspects. By comparing two graph, we could summarize that people who feel unsatisfied with the existing products are more than people who satisfied with the existing products. After our analyzing, we find that people are more willing to buy products which can improve their life quality and provide convenient. For our product, our goal is exactly to improve the effect and decrease the possibility of causing bad impact on people’s health.
This graph shows that the price of a product that could be accepted by general public may be between 10 and 100 yuan. Only a small part of people can accept the price more than 100, and some part of people will chose to pick products which is less than 10 yuan.
Conclusion: Through this research, we found that people’s demands for our product are very large. We also get the information of people’s expectation and what kind of aspects they are satisfied with. Therefore, we can use the analysis from this research to create our product in order to reach the demands of consumers. The results could help us in considering our product from the most basic part as consumers and make a better, more suitable product for consumers. As a result, we use the Internet to build e-shop. We can build a strong relationship between consumers anytime, anywhere by using Internet. Also, Internet can help us spread our product widely. E-shop is a good choice because the cost is comparative low, so we can use a lower cost to do more effective thing, use most of our time in developing our product so that we can magnify our advantages between other existing products. In addition, our product will do no harmto people’s health which is the concern for most people . The effect of our product can last a long time and it is easy to use. Our product not only save time but also improve the quality of people’s life.

Strengths :
Specificity:  Our product targets mosquito larvae. It has no affection on mammals, including human being.
High efficiency: we provide a new method to exterminate mosquito in the larval stage, which can actually prevent mosquito from transmitting diseases.
Long pesticide effect: Some researches indicate that cry4Ba and Mtx1 protein we used in our product have a long period of validity, so our product is durable and economical.
Specialty: There is a team member who majors in economy, while other members are good at doing research and development.
A clear-cut division of labor: Every team member is playing a specific and indispensable part . Everyone is contributing for the team.
Customer service：We set up a customer service department, so we can build up communication between consumers and us. We put ourselves in our customers’ positions in order to hear from them and make our products better.
Online store: Online store is a perfect way for us to commercialize our product. It depends on the Internet which is really popular and powerful. What's more, the cost of online store is really low, because we don't have to pay for any rent.
Weakness: We have tested our products in the laboratory. However, the environment of natural water areas is much more complex, so the effect of our product may not be so idealistic.
O：1.Around people’s residential, there are always suitable place for mosquito to breed. In recent years, there are frequent disease outbreaks that were transmitted by mosquito, such as dengue outbreak in China, India, and other Asia countries so we can infer that public have a large demand of manipulating the bad impact made by mosquito.
2. According to our survey, people really concerned that products of killing mosquito have adverse impact on human’s health，and government concernes that toxic pesticides may damage ecosystem. Our product clearly shows the compositions. Since the compassions are highly special, it will not cause impact on human. Therefore, our product is more likely to be accepted by consumers.
T：Some doubt from public of our product.
