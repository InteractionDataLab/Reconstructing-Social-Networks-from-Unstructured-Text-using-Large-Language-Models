Yu He
He is responsible for the experiment data record and picture collection, conclusion for improvement and suggestions of the experiment. He also involved in the lab experiments. He is responsible for the wiki Attribution part. A member of Human practice projects.
Weiying Ou
She is the main designer of the group poster and presentation powerpoint (including details, animation of PPT). Also, she is in charge of the bacteria part (Bt, Bs) of the whole experiment. She is the designer of human practice’s content of our team, since she was experienced at social activities and propaganda.
Bingquan Liang
He is responsible for the experimental data collection, because of the limitation of his own knowledge, he was not able to carry out those complicated and sophisticated experiments. Therefore, he chose to translate the daily reporter and be the assistance of the daily reporter. Because daily record is of vital significance, each of the experiment have to be record in the document, those information will send on the wiki, and that why there need two recorders.
Yuanqi Jin
She was responsible for all the human practices and public engagement activities. She participated in the lab work and wiki design, and brought cats to our meeting room to keep our team members in a good mood.
Qianqi Liu
She came up with the idea of killing mosquitoes using bacterial proteins when she was searching for bibliography on bio-pesticides. After a large amount of search for more detail, she focused on two bacteria Bacillus subtilisand Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, from which the team obtained the two genes involved in our project, Cry4Ba and MTX1. I am also responsible for introducing the design of the experiment in presentation.
Wuanxuan Jin
In the team, every success can not be separated from the efforts of all. Cause her passion for doing experiment and social promotion activities, she spent lot of time on them. Besides, she was in charge of the entrepreneurship part in the Giant Jamboree and the poster presentation.
Yinghui Wang
She is the connector of the team, connecting other team and bringing about collaboration. Connecting the company. One of the authors of experiment and principal part in wiki, presentation and poster. She is the designer of the logo of our team. Helper in laboratory, often preparing the Gel.
Feixue Ouyang
He often has brainstorm with his teammates and provides a lot of good idea for our project.
Zhengxiong Luo
He helped to make the plan of our product, also he was responsible for the advertisements of the product. Additionally, he also managed the sale of the product and deal with several feedback from the customers. besides, he involved the experiment and Video making.
Qiyuan Chen
He mainly participated in the experiments in our team. He had participated in most of the experiments under the supervising of teachers. As we know, experiment is an important part of our project. He did the genomic DNA extraction of bacteria, constructed genomic DNA into expression vector and the transform of the vector. Though these experience, he has gained so much experience in molecular biology.
Jinpeng Chen
In this summer, he spent most of his summer vacation doing experiments in the lab. Sometimes he went out to find places for the video shooting, because he participate in the short film. He was also a member in the human practice. The team set up stalls in several streets and advertise their project so that they can draw more conclusion.
Wentao yang
He was the one who take charge in the activities recording and the experience photographing, also he is a member in the human practice. He was responsible for propagandizing the project and the product, the directors of the promotional video as well as providing suggestions for video shooting. He used the camera and the UAV（unmanned aerial vehicle）to make the video from different point of view. He also involved in the experiment.
Weiqian Yuan
He was mainly responsible for the Business Plan of our product. In our team, he helped build the wiki and he also maked wonderful PPT. Participating in this project made him gain so much.
Yun Chen
In the team GZHS-United, she took part in several tasks which were beneficial for the final result. For the part of entrepreneurship, she wrote a final paper to summarize the result of the survey which was conduced towards public to investigate the market. Also, she analyzed the  market position for the product PestiJelly and set a business plan to popularize the product.  These jobs helped to better attract audience and helped with purchase. In addition, she attributed to speech draft of business plan which clearly state all of members’ job description. What’s more, she took part in the experiment of engineering and helped to get the final product.
Lab support
Host lab
Thanks to our host lab, the Teaching Center of Biology Experiment in Sen Yet Sun University. It provided us with lab places to all apparatus.
Yishun Zhang
Yishun Zhang is a laboratory chief of the Teaching Center of Biology Experiment in Sen Yet Sun University. He is an experienced and patient advisor. And he conducted safety training and lab regulation.
Jianer Wu
Jianer Wu is a laboratory chief of the Teaching Center of Biology Experiment in Sen Yet Sun University. She is experienced and patient, she is in charge of the apparatus and helped us to do some preparations for experiences. While we were doing experiment, she would monitor us to ensure our safety.
Project support and advice
Honglei Jin
Honglei Jin is a professor at Sen Yet sun University, he expended knowledge about gene engineering to us. He usually brought suggestions to improve our experiment.
Jiabao Xu
In this project, she was the supervisor. She gave team members classes on molecular biology and synthetic biology as well as introduction on virology and bacterioliology. At the very beginning, when one of the student first came up with the idea of doing a project on mosquito larvaecide, she came to her for advice. She told her where to look up for scientific paper and how to get information on the background of current insecticide usage. Later, the team agreed on the project idea, and she sat down and listened to their ideas regarding what experiment they want to do about the project. The team members selected several candidates biological larvaecide bacterial and several genes. And she told them what are the advantages and limitations on each of them. And they decide to go with MTX1 and Cry 4Ba from Bti and BS. Later in the following experiment, such as toxicity test, the supervisor provided them with Aedes albopictus eggs, and taught them how to raise mosquito larvae, before the team members started on their own. She supervised the whole project as whenever they run into any scientific questions, they can turn to her for advises and suggestions.
