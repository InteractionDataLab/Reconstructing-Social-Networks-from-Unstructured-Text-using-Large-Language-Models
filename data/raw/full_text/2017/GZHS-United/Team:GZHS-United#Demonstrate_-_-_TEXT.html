To demonstrate that our system can actually work in real world, we designed two toxicity test to evaluate the toxicity of our engineered bacterial.
This figure indicates the difference of lethality among Bt.i, Bs, cry4Ba E.coli, BL21 E.coli and the negative control. Cry4Ba E.coli and Bti exbited significantly higher toxicity than others. Toxicity of cry4Ba is lower than that of Bt.i because Bt.i contains other toxic proteins from Cry family. However, cry4Ba produced by our engineered E.coli could be purified and is more useful for industrial use.
Our toxicity test results were showing below. According to the data, higher concentration have higher toxicity. We mainly use KT_50 as the parameter to judge the toxicity of toxin.
It's abnormal that the concentration of 4% have higher KT_50 than 5%,
but according to the error bar, this may be just caused by  random error.
Apart from these two toxicity tests, we also did a mathematical modeling to demonstrate our system. The result of modeling is showing in the chapter “ modeling ”
