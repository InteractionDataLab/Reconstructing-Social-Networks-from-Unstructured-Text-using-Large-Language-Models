Team & Members
Our team is consisted by 3 different schools including Guangdong Experimental High School, Guangdong country garden school and  the Affiliated High School of South China Normal University. All of us are really big fans of Biology. By participating in this competition, most of us can learn a lot of knowledge that could not be acquired on the textbooks.
STUDENTS
Qiyuan Chen
My name is Qiyuan Chen. I am 14 years old and studying in Guangdong Experimental Junior High School in grade 8. I love Biology since I was in grade 7. At the beginning, I thought that it is very interesting, so I was excited to search the large zone of biology. And then, I knew the Genetic Engineering and Synthetic Biology, I thought it is important to the future of the human. Now I join the big family of the iGEM. I hope the researching of the synthetic biology will deeper and deeper.
Feixue Ouyanga
My name is Feixue Ouyang. I study at Guangdong Experimental Junior High School. I like swimming and playing computer games. Although I am only 14, I have a great interest on biology. I think iGEM is a great chance to show ourselves, and I hope I can get a good score in the competition.
Yu He
My name is David, now I’m studying in the Guangdong country garden school, I major in biology now, because I’m interest in it, since I was a kid I have fascinated in animal and plants, I was reading biology books every weekend. After I stepped into the junior high school, I have learned more in biology, such as what is the human body system and what is the DNA and what is the gene engineering. I am really curious about DNA because DNA is just like the code of life. DNA is magical and stimulate me to discover more about it, that’s why I joined in iGEM competition and I wish I can achieve a great success in it.
Bingquan Liang
My name is Liang BingQuan, English name is Leo. Now I’m studying GuangDong Country Garden school, located at south of China. I major in biology now, because my mom used to be a doctor. Hence, in the future I might major in medicine. Also that is part of the reasons why I would enjoy the iGEM competition game. As a helpful competition game, iGEM will be a useful material or kind of experience of the apply for my university. Genetic engineering act as a significant and valuable research field, i believe it will be a potential project in the future,  that is the main factor why I attend the iGEM.

I’m a sci-fi lover (especially cyber punk), and I am glad that I have a chance to get close to  synthesis biology - a fascinating field contenting most of my imagination of near future biotechnology. Besides, I’m really good at making gel and the blank control of PCR (although not intentionally).
Abigail Liu
Abigail Liu, 17 years old, a student of Guangdong Country Garden School. Before she stepped into CGS, Biology was nothing more than a compulsory subject. Afterwards, she realized that Biology is not merely about adorable animals: it is about unraveling the mystery of organisms and utilizing the answers to promote human development. Some people don't understand how miraculous Biology is for her: the essence of Biology is invisible to the naked eye and every function that keeps you alive is underway unwittingly at the moment; non-living organic chemicals combines together to become a cell, even an organism, which can operate like a precise instrument; currently, we can even artificially create living entities. The first Biology competition she has entered for now is British Biology Olympiad 2017 in which she won the Highly Commended Award. At present, she is devoting herself to International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition and trying to impress everyone including herself. She knows deeply that she is not the best, but she is making progress with all her ardent love to Biology.
Yun Chen
I’m Winnie Chen from the team GZSH-United. I love biology because once I facing the mystery of lives, I will feel a kind of glory of natural world. Especially for genes, the key part of a living thing, its every combination and expression shows a delicate contact between every lives; and that’s what amazed me. In addition, I also like to some other things in my spare time such as painting and playing bridge which is a kind of card game. By doing these, I may feel a kind of peace with passion inside. Actually, peace and passion are not in the opposite but can exactly show what you like to do.
Weiqian Yuan
My name is Weiqian Yuan. I am 14 years old. I shall be a grade 9 student of Guangdong Experimental High School in Sept. 2017.
Being as a high school student, I not only study hard my school courses, but also have many hobbies. I am good at mathematics, physics and history. My most favorite subject is history. I like reading because it can broaden my vision. Since one of my hobbies is collecting ancient coins, I read many books about Chinese history and archaeology of ancient coins, which help me to learn broad and profound Chinese culture. My other hobbies are paleobiology, stock investment and swimming. I like swimming because it makes me feel happy and strengthens my body.
During this summer holidays in July 2017, I took part in a business imitation challenge hosted by The Economic Association of the Affiliated High School of South China Normal University, HFI Finance Club and Financial and Economic Association Union of the Pearl River Delta. I beat the other grade 11 students and won two prizes of the Best Design Institute and Best Trader. I also took part in Guangdong Geography Olympiad and won the second prize.
I like the sentence of nothing is impossible. I do all my best endeavors to every challenge and never give up easily.

During this process,I have learned how to plan ahead and work efficiently in a scientific environment along side my teammates. I love iGEM because it is really cool getting to do really awesome lab work that I have never thought, and I can see what other people my age and university students around the world are doing.
Zhigang Feng
My name is Zhigang Feng , majored in Biology. An idea, a team, a legendary tour. This is me in the eyes of the iGEM.
Before that, I'm not sure whether high school students know how to return a responsibility, iGEM for them is a piece of blank paper. A year from hiring, topic selection, experiment, modeling,and speech to complete for themselves, the depth of the scientific research experience is difficult to obtain elsewhere. In addition, iGEM also let me feel the team's strong, big to the project, wiki, speech of who will bear responsibility. Small to the campus propaganda, budgets. No one trust each other, the team cooperation tacit understanding is made. As their advicer, I would be glad to share what I know and they, and provide them with some of the ideas. I am very happy with high school students experience igem, they let me know what we can do many things, to find that textbooks of the real world.
