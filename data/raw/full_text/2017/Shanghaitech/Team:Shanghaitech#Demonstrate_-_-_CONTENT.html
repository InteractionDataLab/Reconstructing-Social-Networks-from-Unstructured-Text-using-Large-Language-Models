Hardware</H2></OL><P>We’ve established a platform consist of a hardware for block assembly and software for the public to operate it. We’ve made a special tube to catch pure chemical signal liquid from bacterium culture solutions. By reconfiguring a 3D printer and plus a syringe pump, we can control the transfer of chemical signals among tubes of functional bacteria. With this robot, we’ve realized the assembly of modular bio-systems. It can be easily programmed to significantly reduce the laboratory and time cost during molecular cloning. As a prototype of cloud bio-lab, this robot is able to be controlled remotely. For the public’s friendly usage, this robot can automatically assemble the blocks only base on the logic rules set according to an idea. </P><P>Details: <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Shanghaitech/Hardware">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Shanghaitech/Hardware</A></P><OL start="2"><H2>2.
