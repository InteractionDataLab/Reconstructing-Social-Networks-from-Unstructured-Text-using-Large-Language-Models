We were fascinated by their curiosity and passionate feedback which inspired us to finish our project.</P><P>We gave a seminar to students of “Innovate Class” in No 2 High school attached to ECNU. Although the students never heard of synthetic biology, they understood the concept quickly, and generated fantastic ideas using synthetic biology. The philosophy of our Magic Blocks brings infinite possibilities to them whose curiosity never get satisfied. </P><P>Another activity has taken place in the High School attached to Fudan University, where we gave another seminar on modern synthetic biology to senior students. Most of them never thought of get things done in synthetic biology before, and our project in lowering the barrier for the public to participate synthetic biology kindled their interest. We got a lot of questions even after the seminar. </P><H3 style="" font-size="20"><B>Bio-design Thinking Class</B></H3><DIV class="image-text-container image-text-centered"><P style="" font-size="19">Fig 2.

They showed great creativity, like ‘Bio + Computer’, ‘Bio + artificial rainfall’, ‘Bio + Bluetooth’, ‘Bio + Sound’. Everyone drew their designs. The great passion of students in scientific innovation indeed is infectious to us. We also interviewed their instructors Zhe Jin to discuss about her ideas in instructing students to technological events. We hope that our Magic-Block platform would help tp realize their dreams with modern biology.</P><H2 style="" font-size="22"><B>Social Media</B></H2><H3 style="" font-size="20"><B>WeChat official account</B></H3><DIV class="image-text-container image-text-centered"><P style="" font-size="19">Fig 3.

The topics include popular scientific articles in synthetic biology, brief introduction of MagicBlock, introducing our workshops. We have received many comments saying that they are excited to find a new area about design and creation. Also, a number of suggestions from the readers really inspired us to improve our project.</P><P>In summary, through the public education, we realized our aim of building a platform for public to learn synthetic biology and realize their wonderful ideas is fun and urgent. We also receives valuable feedbacks to improve our project.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
