致谢(Special Thanks)
我们最终成绩的获得离不开队伍成员以外诸多人员的无私奉献，14级生命学院的贾晓宁作为指导员为队伍的运转提供意见, 15级物质学院的许鹏程为元件的功能验证提供了质谱数据, 15级信息学院的李逸柯, 16级信息学院的研究生张帅为硬件的搭建和维护提供了许多帮助, 14级生命学院的刘奕在试验上提供了协助与建议。
The following achievements would not be possible without the selfless dedication of the following people that are not formally team members. They are Xiaoning Jia, instructor, who had been providing his opinions the whole year and assisted the operation of our team during the last few weeks; Pengcheng Xu, who helped us to get HPLC-MS measurements of our signal molecules. The success of our hardware owes much to Yike Li and Shuai Zhang, who helped with the construction and maintenance of our robot. Yi Liu assisted us in our wet lab.
此外，生命学院的助理教授廖军、林照博和孙文智；物质学院的助理教授钟超与杨晓瑜；免疫化学所的副研究员聂焱；信息学院的助理教授梁俊睿等均对课题给予了支持与帮助。
Moreover, we really appreciate the support from Liao Jun Lab, Zhong Chao Lab, Yang Xiaoyu Lab, Lin Zhaobo Lab, Prof. Wenzhi Sun, Prof. Yan Nie, and Prof. Junrui Liang.
Thank you!
