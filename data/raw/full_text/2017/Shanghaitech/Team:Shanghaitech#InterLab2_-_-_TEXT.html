Abstract
Repeatability is one of the most important part of biological experiment, however, it’s difficult to repeat the measurement data in different labs. As for the measurement of fluorescence, it can be influenced by various factors: bacterial strain, culture medium, plate reader and so on. Therefore, following a standard protocol strictly is one of the guarantee of the repeatable experimental conclusion. This year, we use plate reader rather than flow cytometry in 2016 ( click here to view ). Except for individual settings, we follow the standard protocol by iGEM authority completely, the data is reliable.
Plasmids and the prediction of results
All the eight plasmids are shown below:
From the table above, there are three different constitutive promotors (pcons) and two different ribosome binding sites (RBSs), which form six different combinations as Test Device 1-8.
(http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J23101)
According                         to the data of iGEM parts, we know that the strength of these three pcons: J23101＞J23106＞ J23117. However, there lacks the                            reliable data of the strength of pcon (J23151) and the comparison of three RBSs                            (B0032, B0034, J364100). In conclusion, we predict the result of the Interlab fluorescence                            measurement:
       Test Device 1 ＞ Test Device 2 ＞ Test Device 3
Test Device 4 ＞ Test Device 5 ＞ Test Device 6

Cell measurement
Materials
E.coli K-12 DH5α component cells
LB (Luria Bertani) medium
Chloramphenicol (stock concentration 30 mg/mL dissolved in EtOH - working stock 30 ug/mL)
(This concentration                         refers to one of our PIs, and it’s the common concentration in my lab.)
(The file can be download                         here:

14 mL polypropylene                         round-bottom tube with aluminum foil cover
(Comparing with 50mL                         falcon tube, it is much more suitable for incubation, the reason is that its cover                         isn’t completely closed which can make the oxygen entry freely, so the E.coli can be incubated in an aerobic environment.)
 
Incubator at 37℃
1.5 mL eppendorf tubes for sample storage
Ice bucket with ice
Pipettes
Method
Day                            1: Transform ​E.coli​ DH5α with eight kinds of plasmids from 2017 iGEM kit, plate 7.
Day                            2: Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate                            it on 5 mL LB medium + chloramphenicol in 14mL                            polypropylene round-bottom tube. Grow the cells overnight for 18 hours                            at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Day                            3​: Cell growth, sampling, and assay.
◻ Set the instrument to read OD600 (as OD calibration setting)
◻ Measure OD600 of the overnight cultures
◻ Record data in the notebook
◻ Import data into Excel (​Dilution Calculation​) Sheet_1 provided
◻ Dilute the cultures to a target OD​600 of 0.02 in ​5 m​L LB medium + Chloramphenicol 14mL                            polypropylene round-bottom tube with aluminum foil cover.
(Overmuch cultures in                            tube leads to anaerobic environment. Therefore, about 1/3 cultures here.)
◻ Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm.
◻ Take 500 µL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation.
◻ Place samples on ice.

       According                            to the diagram above, we can notice that when the concentration of fluorescein                            is high (＞10μM), the curve                            doesn’t follow linear relation. As for this problem, we have communicated with                            other iGEM team, as expected, this is a common question. Referring to some materials,                            we give two possible explanations:
——When concentration is too high, light cannot                            pass through the sample to cause excitation, thus very high concentrations can                            have very low fluorescence.
——The surface portion of sample nearest the                            light absorbs too much light, little is available for the rest portion of the                            sample; thus the readings will not be linear, though the measurement will be                            within the range of a calibration curve.

All the raw data                            and following tables refer to the wells arrangement of iGEM protocal below:
 
 
 
Results:
 
OD600 —— 0h
OD600 —— 2h
OD600 —— 4h
OD600 —— 6h
 
Fluorescence —— 0h
Fluorescence —— 2h
Fluorescence —— 4h
Fluorescence —— 6h
 
The curve are                            shown below:
 
OD600 0——6 h
We find that                            Positive Control and Test Device 1 have a lower OD600 value at 2h and 4h.                            According to the fluorescence curve, we suppose the more efficient GFP                            expression (strong promotor and RBS) leads to the less OD600 value. Generally                            speaking, all the eight kinds of bacteria have the similar growth condition                            during 0——6 h.
 
Fluorescence 0——6 h
According to the                            diagram above, we can find distinctly that Positive Control、 Test Device 1 and Test Device 4 have more efficient GFP expression                            than the others.
 
Fluorescence/OD600 0——6 h
Generally speaking,                         the fluorescence/OD600 value means the amount of GFP in each bacterium, thus,                         this value can represent the GFP expression strength than fluorescence value.
the diagram shows the fluorescence/OD600                         results among the six devices:
       Test Device 1 ＞ Test                      Device 2 ＞ Test Device 3
Test Device 4 ＞ Test Device 5 ＞ Test Device 6
The results correspond                         to the prediction, which means that our data is strict and reliable.
