This year, we have constructed several sensors and reporters as our inputs and executors to provide users more options when using the MagicBlock system. These blocks include lacI-lasI, which generates signals upon induction; pcons+GFP, which constitutively generates signals; lasR-GFP and lasR-mRFP, which present different fluorescence and lasR-amilCP, which gives bacteria resistance to chloramphenicol. Meanwhile, we also collected parts that can be reformed for our MagicBlock from other teams. For example, we have collected promoters that can sense nitrogen from UCAS, an auto-inducer quorum-sensing generator from SiCAU-China, a toolbox of recombinase from Fudan-China, cellulase and pectinase from LanZhou iGEM team, and Bt toxin protein from FAFU-China. In addition to part collection, we also reconstructed some MagicBlocks from previous characterized parts so that they can be integrated into our project. Thus our library was and will be continuously improved by users to increase the versatility.
