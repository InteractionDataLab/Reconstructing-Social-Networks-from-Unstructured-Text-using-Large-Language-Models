Biosafety
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
Lab safety Manual
To deal with the problem, we have edited a security manual in Chinese, which includes risk assessment, personal protection facilities, the use of laboratory equipment, emergency treatment and so on, providing a reference for biosafety education in Chinese universities. We sent the manual to teachers responsible for laboratory safety in our university and received positive feedbacks saying that our work is helping to explain the details of biosafety at an international level. We will complete it continuously and make it become an indispensable part of our experimental lessons.

Education video in Chinese
Weâ€™ve proposed an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.
Teams participated the production:
ShanghaiTech University
University of Chinese Academy of Science
Tianjin University
Tianjin University of Science & Technology
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
Beijing Normal University
Wuhan University
Huazhong Agricultural University
Anhui University of Technology
Nanjing Agricultural University
Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University
