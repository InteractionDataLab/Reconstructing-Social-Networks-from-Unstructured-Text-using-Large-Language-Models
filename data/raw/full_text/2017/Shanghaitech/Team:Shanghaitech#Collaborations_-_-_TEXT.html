Biosafety education video in Chinese
Biosafety is one of the most important issues everyone should be aware of before starting any biology related experiments.  However, the biosafety education in China is far behind the fast development of modern biological research.  In some places, students are not trained properly because of the outdated education material or the language barrier that prevent them from reading biosafety guidelines written in English.
We’ve participated in an intercollegiate collaborating project to produce a series of biosafety education movies, all in Chinese.  This video collection has been uploaded online and is freely available at our homepage on YouTube and Bilibili , a popular Chinese video-sharing website.
Teams participated the production:
ShanghaiTech University
University of Chinese Academy of Science
Tianjin University
Tianjin University of Science & Technology
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China
Beijing Normal University
Wuhan University
Huazhong Agricultural University
Anhui University of Technology
Nanjing Agricultural University
Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University

Reagent share to USTC
iGEM team USTC is working on the CdS based bio-film. They want to know whether CdS nanoparticles can increase the cathode-current as expected. A key component for one of their experiments requires CdS quantum dots, which they cannot generate by themselves.
We provided them the CdS quantum dots sample. They added our sample into the culture to assist bio-film formation onto the surface of a graphite electrode. Theoretically, CdS quantum dots would be attached to the surface of the bacteria as the bio-film was formed.

Collaboration with UCAS
To fully characterize UCAS's need of their data, we helped them characterize their nitrogen promoter to make their data more solid. In addition, we used their promoter to construct new parts which could sense the concentration of nitrogen, which could help enrich our input library.
Collaboration with Fudan-China
Our team visited Fudan_China in August to exchange ideas of two projects. We discussed the problem met in their modeling and found an available method to describe this complex dynamic model. Each part of this system will affect others at the same time, so it is impossible to give an analytic solution. We talked about the possibilities of dividing their circuit into smaller parts that can be delivered by their multilayer signal processing system and finally gave a realistic model.
Library construction
We collect parts from other teams to help with our project,constructing our library
Meeting
In this summer, our team attended several meetings organized by other iGEM teams. We have learned a lot from these meetings by interacting with other teams. We are also benefited from exchanging ideas and initiating collaborations during these meetings. On the other hand, our idea about the synthetic biology platform also synergized with other team’s project.
