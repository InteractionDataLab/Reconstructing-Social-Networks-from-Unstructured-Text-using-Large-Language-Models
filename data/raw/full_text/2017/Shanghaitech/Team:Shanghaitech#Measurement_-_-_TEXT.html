Measurement
Measuring the actual level of Acyl Homoserine Lactates or AHLs, the signaling molecule for Lux-like quorum sensing systems in Gram negatives is a hard task during the study of quorum sensing system. The common Method to detect the production of AHLs is Liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (LC/MS) , But LC/MS still has it's limitation on sample preparation, equipment avalibility and quantification accuracy. With the help of the kinetics modeling, here we developed a protocol using the fluorescent protein coupled AHL receiver germs to measure the actual AHLs concentration in high precision and sensitivity.
There are a lot of exciting parts in the Registry, but many parts have still not been characterized. Synthetic Biology needs great measurement approaches for characterizing new parts, and efficient new methods for characterizing many parts at once. If you've done something exciting in the area of Measurement, describe it here!
