Simple Database
Submit & Retrieve & Review
First, we created a simple database, the user can submit their parts and add description to the database, and other users can retrieve the parts.
But how can we ensure the quality of their parts? To solve this problem, we also introduce the 'Comment' function, which means our users can rate and comment on the parts.
Python Crawler
To enrich our database information, we wrote a Python crawler for iGEMâ€™s website, which can crawl the relevant parts information on the site (all the parts from iGEM indicate the origin source). Users can download this script from here.
Users should install "selenium" and ChromeDriver before they use it.
