Circuit Game
Video on How to Use Software
The following videos show how to use our software.
Game Now!
We embed this game in the webpage so you can have a try. You can download the data according to the rules and send us the data through e-mail or facebook.
(This software is under MIT license.)
Why we design this software?
Designing genetic circuits has a high bar in expertise, which might be too complicated for non-biology workers. In addition, due to the relatively small gene capacity of a regular plasmid, putting all element gene in one plasmid is very challenging even for experts.
So our software is designed for the public to build their ideal products like playing a computer game. Users will feel comfortable to use the brief user interface by dragging the elements of the circuit and combining them freely on the computer to build their own bio-products, which really solves the problems close to our life, as well as stimulating new ideas about synthetic biology. As soon as the circuits designed from the game are uploaded, they will be automatically programmed through a 3D printing machine. The public can confirm the feasibility of the design without engaging the experiments by themselves. Finally, users will get the results of their designs, as well as suggestions on how to improve their circuits. We implement the non-biologistsâ€™idea by using the user interface and auto 3D printing program, which encourages public participation in synthetic biology and helps us to improve our project. In summary, our software not only directly interacts with users, but could also achieve self-improvement. Together with hardware, it enables non-biologists to realize their synthetic biology dream
Our software are used in Human Practice's Workshop and receive good response. For more details, you can see here
