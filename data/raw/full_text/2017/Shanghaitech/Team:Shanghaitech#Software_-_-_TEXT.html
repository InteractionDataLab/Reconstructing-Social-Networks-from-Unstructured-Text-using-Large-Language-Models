Software
Introduction
In our project, software is one of the key components that allow the public to access synthetic biology without wet-lab experience. It is impossible for everyone to learn how to construct a plasmid or complete a molecular clone in a bio-lab. So our software is designed for who have great ideas on using biological components to fit their needs and want to get rid of doing tremendous works in wet-lab. Furthermore, people with no biological background have access to design their own biological circuits! With the help of our software, users can complete a real genetic circuits only by selecting several standard parts and linking them. We expect the user with different backgrounds will contribute many amazing designs, which significantly explore the potential of genetic circuits to solve practical problems.
