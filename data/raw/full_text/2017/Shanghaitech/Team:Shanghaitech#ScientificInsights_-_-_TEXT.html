In addition to the public and community’s feedback, we also obtained professional insights and suggestion to improve our project. We visited and interviewed scholars from different backgrounds including computational biology, synthetic biology, and electronic engineering. Interchanging of thoughts between our team and those experts inspired and encouraged us to further perfecting our project’s design and practicing. These insights provide guidelines for our follow-up works including human practice, hardware and software design, and modeling.
