To test the function of generator
     Samples were prepared as the following: Inoculate bacteria transformed with QS generator plasmid into liquid LB at a ratio of 1: 100. Put the bacteria into the rocking device with 220rpm and 37℃ (t=0h). After 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours, take 1ml of bacteria in a small tube, centrifuge at 7000rpm for 5min, filter the supernate with 0.22mm bacteria filter membrane, put the filtered liquid in a tube at 4℃. Add another 1ml liquid LB to a tube, and add 1ul small molecules of the concentration of 10-2M, as a positive control. For negative control, 1ml LB with chlorampenicol without small molecules.
 
To Test the attenuation of signal molecules
     Take overnight grown lasR-GFP bacteria, inoculated to 20ml LB with the ratio of 1: 100. Culture at 37 ℃ in shaker of 220rpm to OD 600= 0.1. Aliquot the bacteria to 8 tubes, marked as 1-7h and blank, each tube 2ml. Add 2ul 0.01M small molecules to the first 7 tubes, and put them back to the shaker. Then according to the time on the tube, remove a tube to collect 1ml supernatant every 1h. Collect the blank supernatant at t= 7 hours. Preparation of standard solution: add 1ul 0.1M small molecules to 1ml chloramphenicol LB.
 
VI. Verify the relationship with expression of GFP and OD600
1. Take 1200ul bacteria   solution , centrifuge at 5000rpm for five minutes, discard the supernatant, and then add 1000ul H20 and 200ul 60% glycerol. Mix completely.
2. Gradient preparation: mark the mixed bacteria from the previous step as 1, take 600ul 1 and add 600ul 10% glycerol, mix thoroughly and mark it as 1/2. Repeat this procedure until we got the marks of 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and the 10% glycerol solution was labeled as zero. Add 150ul into the 96-well plate and read the data in the Multimode Reader. Save the data and the original result.
 
VII. Fluorescence measurement induced by gradient concentration of Signal Molecules
  Bacteria cells were prepared for fluorescence plate reader experiments as follows: Strains of bacteria were grown overnight and then reseeded in a 1:100 dilution into fresh media containing corresponding antibiotics. The dilution was allowed to grow for about 2 h until it reached OD 600 ≈ 0.1. Then, the cell culture were evenly distributed into the number of tubes and induced with a range of AHL (the signal molecules) concentrations (1:10 serial dilutions from 1 × 10–4 M to 1 × 10–10 M or 1 × 10–14 M). Choose different types of AHLs with different concentrations as shown in figures. AHLs stocks were dissolved in proper solvents. After induction, the cells were allowed to grow for about 7 h. We took out 5 ul samples to check the green or red fluorescence under a  microscope . If the fluorescence can be seen, we centrifuged the remaining samples with 7000rpm for 5min and discarded the supernatant. We used 10% glycerol to resuspend the cells, and then add 150ul into the 96-well plate to measure for OD600 and GFP fluorescence with a Tecan infinite M200Pro. We used the following fixed settings: no top, fixed gain of 61, excitation of 485 nm, emission of 520 nm, and Z-position of 19500. All GFP measurements were normalized by dividing their raw values by the OD600 of that well to give a “per-cell” measurement.

The glue gun is aimed at the angle between the tube and the filter paper so that the glue fills the gap between the gun and the corner, smearing a circle of glue.
Put the filter paper up, in the edge of the filter paper, smear a circle of glue to ensure that the glue wrapped around the side of the filter paper, wrapped part of the overall integration with the previous one.
       Unscrew the lid of the 15 ml centrifuge tube and fill it with glue at the gap of the tube and the lid of the 50 ml centrifuge tube, taking care not to be higher than the thread.

Day 0
1. Preparation of autoinducer working solution with different concentration gradient
Dilute the autoinducers to 8-well PCR tubes such that they will have the desired concentration when added to the well plate.
Final Concentration for every column of wells:
10-7  10-8  10-9  10-10  10-11  10-12  0(NC)  0(M9 Medium)
Since that every well is set to contain 200μL samples, working solution concentration is:
2*10-5   2*10-6  2*10-7  2*10-8  2*10-9  2*10-10   0(NC)  0(M9 Medium)
Note:
• For every Homoserine Lactate autoinducer, it’s recommended to prepare concentration gradient
Working solution needed for all further experiments at the same time to ensure the repeatability.
• The gradient working solution could be stored at 4°C
• Most Homoserine Lactate autoinducers have a non-polar tail, we choose DMSO as solvent.
• DO NOT use solvent with high volatility such as Chloroform. Using such solvents may cause a greater variation in concentration.
Day 1
2. The night before testing, grow bacteria and blank controls overnight for all samples in M9 Media.
The above step takes about 15 minutes.
Day 2
3. Dilute all the cultures to an optical density of 0.05 (OD600).

Steps above take about 15 minutes plus a ~3 hours waiting time.
5. When the OD of the samples reached 0.5, distribute samples into a 96 well plate, 200μL per well. Every concentration level occupied a row which gave us 12 parallel repeats.
6. Add pre-diluted Autoinducer concentration gradient working solution to all 12 columns.
7. Put the plate in a Synergy fluorescence plate reader and take regular measurements of OD and fluorescence.
⁃For GFP use excitation frequency of 485nm and an emission frequency of 528nm

Day 0
1. Preparation of autoinducer (Rpa signal molecules) solution at different concentration.
Dilute the autoinducers in an 8-well PCR strip with DMSO to make the final concentration in each tube (mol•L-1):
10-7  10-8  10-9  10-10  0 (DMSO & LB only)
Since that every well is set to contain 50ml samples, working solution concentration in 1ml LB medium is:
10-4  10-5  10-6  10-7  0 (DMSO & LB only),
Note:
• For every Homoserine Lactate autoinducer, it’s recommended to prepare all working solution at the same time to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments.
• The concentration gradient working solution should be stored at 4°C.
• Most Homoserine Lactate autoinducers have a non-polar tail, we choose DMSO as the solvent.

9. Dilute all the signal receiver cultures to OD600 of 0.05 with at least 20ml volume.
10. Let the bacteria to grow for approximately 3-4 hours, monitor OD600 to make sure it does not grow above 0.5.
Note:
• When adding autoinducer concentration gradient working solution to 50ml centrifuge tubes, the order should be adding the lower concentrated working solution first to minimize the interference of leftover solution.
11. When the OD600 of the signal receiver culture reaches 0.5, distribute samples into a 96-well plate used in step 8, 200μL per well.
12. Add pre-diluted autoinducer concentration gradient working solution to first three columns as the positive control to prove that the Las signal molecules exist in the liquid that induce LasR-GFP .
