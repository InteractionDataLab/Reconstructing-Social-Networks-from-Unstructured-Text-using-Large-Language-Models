CAHSs are members of Tardigrade Specific Intrinsically Disordered Protein(TDP), they are identified as heat soluble proteins, found in Tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini. It can form a biological glass under osmotic stress. ( Read more about CAHS )These parts are the Coding Sequence for CAHSs, which they can protect the probiotics during the drying process. With CAHS, dried probiotics can be stored under room temperature for a long time.
BBa_K2472000, BBa_K2472001 and BBa_K2472002 shows different desiccation tolerance. ( Read more about their results )
We also put them into a packed device which can be used directly. We use pTet-On system to control the expression.
BBa_K2472006
Damage Suppressor Protein is a protein from Ramazzottius varieomatus, this protein can protect DNA from radiation damage. It can adhere to DNA, prevent the damaging DNA from moving around, so the fixed DNA can wait for the repairing system.
BBa_K2472007 is the Coding Sequence of the Damage Suppressor Protein, it can protect DNA from radiation damage, or some other DNA breaking inductive damage. Teams with project working with radiation, can use this part to maintain their device's integrity.
We construct a packed device , so it can be used straight away.
