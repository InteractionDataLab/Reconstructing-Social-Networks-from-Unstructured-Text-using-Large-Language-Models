Probiotic Production
Probiotics, by definition, are living microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. It has long been suggested to be health beneficial with effects like prevention of AAD (antibiotic associated diarrhoea) [1] , increase HDL in blood [2] , and when prescription of antibiotic has interrupt microbial balance in the gastrointestinal tract, probiotic may be able to restored the balance [1] . Nowadays, people have increased awareness of probiotics’ importance for health, the demand from the market thus rise and various production techniques are employed. In order for the probiotics to maintain their effectiveness all though their shelf-life, they need to be dried into pallets or powder before releasing into the market. Spray, freeze, vacuum and fluid bed drying are four major ways [3] . However, stress would be induced during the drying process and will severely affect the viability and thus the effectiveness of probiotics after rehydration.

Main feature
Cheap to scale up, powder characteristic can be controlled
Batch process, involve sublimation, micronisation step is needed to further break the dry cake into particles
Rather like freeze drying, despite water evaporation happened, instead of sublimation
Dried bacteria may be carried away by the drying air result in low yeild
Within all these different methods, they have one thing in common—various stress are induced during the dehydration process, examples like shear stress [4,8] , oxidative stress [5,8] , heat stress [6,8] , chemical stress and osmotic stress [7,8] . Cell membrane in particular, appears to be damaged and significantly affect cells viability. Its fluid bilayer structure was originally stabilised via Van der Waals forces and hydration repulsion, which is severely weakened by lose of water [7] .Package default will occur during rehydration process because the regular arrangement of phospholipids is disrupted during dehydration, and this cause leakage of cellular components [9] . Dehydration brought severe decrease in viability of the cells after rehydration and cells’ resilience seems to be a major concern.
Protection by adding protective agent
Three main protective strategies can be envisaged to maintain their Viability after dehydration:
Change the process parameters, like lowering the temperature, or pressure within certain range [10]
Pre-stressing the cell prior to drying, which induces their own protective stress responses [11]
Add protective agents.
Saccharides(e.g. Sucrose, lactose, trehalose) [12,13] is one of the most commonly used protectant and was proved to be efficient in improving resilience of cells, several correlated mechanisms have been proposed. Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide of glucose, have been widely accepted as a long-time protectant. However, cost of production is significantly increased by artificially adding trehalose, and we are hoping to find a suitable substituent for it.

The phylum Tardigrada
They roamed the island and sea that human has never been, they survived though 5 masses extinction and given rise to about 1150 knowned species [17] . These strangely cute organisms, with cylindrical body and stubby eight legs are famous for their ability to survive in extreme conditions that would be fatal to other life forms, phrases like “toughest organism” “return from the dead” are frequently seen together with their names. Because of their peculiar resilience, their traces could be found almost everywhere, across the seven continent including Antarctica, a wide range of biomes, the dessert, ice field, deep sea or maybe in your garden. They are able to tolerate deadily UV radiation and osmotic rays [18] , as well as the almost complete dehydration by switching to ‘anhydrobiotic state’, which confer resistance towards various environmental extremes.
What’s worth mentioning is that, anhydrobiotic ability is observed in various invertebrates, tardigrades, arthropods, and nematodes [14] . Trehalose are suggested to have an important role mediating desiccation resistance in anhydrobiotic organisms, however, the accumulation of trehalose is observed when the last two phylum subjected to desiccation, but not in tardigrades [15,16] . With further searching, we noticed that tardigrades’ anhydrobiotic ability are mediated by a rather novel class of protein called TDPs (tardigrades intrinsically disorded proteins)----the protein that our iGEM team is currently focusing on.
About our project
a) Inspiration
Every year, iGEM competition motivates teams from all over the world to devise numerous great project, genetically engineered organisms are designed to serve in wide range of fields. However, when it comes to application, the regulation of gene expression is not the only rising issue, but also the resilience of these engineered organisms that we need to concern. For example, some team’s bacteria have to work in dessert with extremely low water content( .ref ), or when cell components are freeze dried on the test paper to make a paper based biosensor, the system must undergo severe dehydration for storage and transport, and this would probably hamper their effectiveness during work.( .ref ). Our investigationfor the 2016 iGEM projects showed that over 299 entries, x% engineered organisms are facing practical issues related with extreme working conditions or environmental stress. As a consequence, team SIAT-SCIE is focusing on how we can transform the resilience of tardigrades into the engineered organisms. Increasing their efficiency during work and gives them greater potential to be put into real practice.
b) What are we doing?
Our first goal is to test whether TDPs can provide desiccation resistance for enzyme in vitro.
Secondly, we transfer our designed plasmid into DH5α and express TDP in vivo to see if it can confer desiccation resistance, by comparing the engineered strain with the E. coli that didn’t express the TDP gene. Hence a protection mechanism is developed, which can facilitate other iGEM teams engineered organisms to work efficiently.
During ametabolic state, the DNA repairing mechanism is halted and cells are vulnerable to mutagenic radiation. Hence our final goal is to ameliorate our protection system by expressing the protein Dsup, in providing resistance towards radiation for the engineered bacteria, as well as MnSOD, which protect against oxidative stress during desiccation process.
