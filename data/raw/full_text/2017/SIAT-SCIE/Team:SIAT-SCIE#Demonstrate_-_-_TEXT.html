Radiation Tolerance Experiment
The expression is induced by different concentration of IPTG, and use a microplate reader to obtain the fluorescence, which can indicate the amount of protein expressed. Then we dilute the broth, take 100μl of diluted broth, spread them on the petri dish, to obtain the original Clone Forming Unit per 100μl diluted broth. Then take 100μl of diluted broth, spread them on the petri dish. Place the petri dish under UV for different time periods, then grow over night, to obtain the Clone Forming Unit per 100μl of diluted irradiated broth. From these experiments, we can count the survival rates of the bacteria with different amount of Dsup protein expressed and survival rates of bacteria after different amount of radiation irradiated.

Conclusion:
We can see the survival rate of the ones with IPTG added, is significantly higher than the ones without IPTG. We can say that the presence of Dsup increase the survival rate of bacteria, after the bacteria is irradiated. So, Dsup can protect organism under radiation conditions.
Further analysis of the data is explained on modeling.
