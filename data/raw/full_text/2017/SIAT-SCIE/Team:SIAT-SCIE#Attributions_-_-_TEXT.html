InterLab
We are greatly thankful to everyone who participates our project in any time. As a team almost starting from zero, it is great to have every one of you. The teammates, the advisors, the instructors, the advisors, the seniors in the lab, the schoolmates and the parents, we will never reach here without you all.
Advisors & Instructors
Haoqian Zhang
We got in touch with Dr. Haoqian Zhang in the very beginning. He is the one who gave us the general ideas of topic selection and shared his experience on iGEM. Moreover, he helped us to contact the Chinese Academy of Science, which provided us with laboratories.
Chenli Liu
Dr. Chenli Liu generously accepted our application for using his lab, and helped us with the overall planning of the entire experiment design. Only with his lab were we able to have a place to carry out experiments.
Xiongfei Fu
Dr. Xiongfei Fu helped us significantly on our understanding synthetic biology and modeling.
Qian Chen
Qian Chen got in contact with us when we first tried cooperating, then she lead us through the safety precautions in labs, and the basic experimental skills. She was always keeping an eye on us, stopping us from blowing up the whole lab, giving us experimental support when we were confused by all kinds of weird data, and cheering us up while we were all in a low mood. Also, she used her resources to help us find other scientists, for further experimental advices.
Team Establishing
Xiao Yang ‘Jimmy’
Jimmy was appointed as the team leader for this year, and he selected the first several team members.
Shan Jiang ‘Harry’
Harry was the one of the first members Jimmy recruited, and he found more people in different aspects to reinforce every part of the project. Also, he contacted Dr. Haoqian Zhang, and negotiate with Chinese Academy of Science for the laboratory.
Yanci Qiu ‘Eloise’
Eloise was the main contributor from last year’s project, she was experienced and found some other team members with passions on synthetic biology.
Concepts, Theories and Feasibility Report
Shan Jiang ‘Harry’
Harry read all the papers, conclude the mechanism of the proteins, background information of Tardigrades, and the general design of the experiment.
Xiao Yang ’Jimmy’
Jimmy went through Harry’s report and point out some mistakes or vague expressions on his report.
Background Research
Hongyi Yu ‘Sandy’
Junhan Liao ‘Jean’
Jean and Sandy spent a lot of time going through the previous years’ projects, with their statistic report and their literature review, we found out the potential of our product.
Yanci Qiu ‘Eloise’
Eloise summarize the previous problems of bacteria storage, compared our product and the pervious existing methods.
Experiment
