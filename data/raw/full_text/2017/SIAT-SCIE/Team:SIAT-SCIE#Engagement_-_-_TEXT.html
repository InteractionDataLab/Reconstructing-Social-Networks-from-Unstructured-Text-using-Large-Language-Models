The Popularization of Synthetic Biology and iGEM
On Oct 27th, our team and SMS_Shenzhen gave a lecture to students in Shenzhen Middle School. Since the junior high students have already been exposed to basic biology including fundamental knowledge about DNA, in an-hour-long lecture we told them more about detailed DNA structure, inheritance and plasmid working mechanism. We then introduced them to the central theme of synthetic biology. Most students showed great interest in the lecture and asked tons of questions, not only about what we have covered but also some extended ones. In the end, we delivered our “iGEM survival guide” to them to popularize both synthetic biology and iGEM competition.
After the lecture finished, iGEMers from SMS_Shenzhen gave us and their middle school students a tour of their laboratory. We taught the students how to use micropipettes and they were quite impressed by so many accurate, delicate equipments.
