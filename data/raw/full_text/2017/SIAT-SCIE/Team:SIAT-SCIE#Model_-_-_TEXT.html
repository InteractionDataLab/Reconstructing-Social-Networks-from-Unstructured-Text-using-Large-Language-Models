So, overall we can see that the control groups have similar clone numbers, while the + IPTG group displays approximately 4 to 5 fold survivability. The induced Dsup protein can help the cell survive high radiation exposure.
Due to the limited sample size, we are unable to conduct T-test or similar statistical tests on our data.
We have adopted a simpler model to investigate the correspondence between Dsup expression and survival rate.
Assume a pair of constants, representing the cell damage rate. (k1 and k2 for â€“ IPTG and + IPTG groups)
Let the survival of cells be function S(t), given the cells are under UV light incidence,
Solve the equation, we have,
Put in the data, we have
Solve differential equations in Mathematica, we have
k1 = 1.26507
k2 =0.95675
The Dsup increases the cell resilience to radiation about 25%.
Extend time to 20s, we have the following expectations
We noticed the model is somehow inaccurate after extending the UV time to 10s onwards, taking into account the sample size, this is what we can do.
A more accurate analysis is in the PDF file attached.             Another complete differential analysis is in another PDF down below.
