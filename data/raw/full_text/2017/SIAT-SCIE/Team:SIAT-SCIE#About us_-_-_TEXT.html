This summer, I have been responsible for the designing and performing of our experiments. Previous experience has helped me a lot ，however iGEM let me realized that there are still much to learn. Although final year in high school is very busy， I still immensely enjoyed preparing for this year's iGEM and hope we can get a good result ！—Eloise⁄(⁄ ⁄ ⁄ω⁄ ⁄ ⁄)⁄
Hi everyone!
I am Shan Jiang, this is my first year attending the iGEM competition. I am involved in almost every aspect of our team this year. As a fresh man I don't know how I became a team leader, maybe it’s like a famous poem‘I shall dedicate myself to the interests of the country to the life and death, irrespective of the personal will and world.' Actually I am a better soccer player than a biologist →_→ .
Hi everyone! My name is Yueyi Xu, I am a member of SIAT-SCIE. I am in charge of some wet lab work and Human Practice job. I’m interested in biology and chemistry. Since I joined the iGEM group in SCIE, I’ve learned a lot of skills such as to research data, create ideas, cooperate and communicate with other members. Above all, I have learned a lot and experienced the excitements that exclusive for iGEMers.
Hi everyone!
I am Yixuan Zhao.For my role in our team, I am the Human Practice group leader and a member of lab group. Thanks to this incredible experience in iGEM competition,I've had the chance to communicate and cooperate with friends who are also interested by biology. If you have any questions upon the Human Practice part of our team please contact me via our official email without hesitation. Looking forward to meet you at the Giant Jamboree:).
Hi everyone! the
‘one that never went into wet lab’
, the
‘leader in name only’
, the
‘programmer mastermind’
and the mathematical modeler is a most peculiar creature that works in the dark with various DNA design and mathematical software.His endeavor of using math to precisely model biological information is indeed admirable, although the yield was negligible.
Hi everyone!
I am Junhan Liao. I do some wet lab work in the team and I'm also the team's wiki designer, the illustrator and in charge of part of the Human Practice job. I hope to contribute to the team by using my knowledge and passion in biology thus i joined the team. I hope to learn more about synthetic biology and also other parts of biology in order to create magnificent projects with my teammates in the future.
I am Xingyue Huang and I am the wiki programmer. To be honest I have no idea what the team is doing when I came to this team. Though I am not a Biology guy I find this project quite intriguing, so I am willing to help the team by doing some programming work. I hope I can practice my web-constructing skill(which I did become an 'expert' in doing that) and learn something about synthetic biology (although I might not understand any word)
Hey everyone. My name is Yongpeng Fu. I’m in charge of the game and part of the wiki for this IGEM project. From designing the structure to writing the code, I tried my best to make this game as interesting as possible. It’s quite hard for me because I’ve never written any code in HTML, JS or CSS. So I guess this is my first shot trying to complete it. Hope you enjoy the game when you are visiting our website! Shan Jiang █████ me! I [Data Pluged]!
I am Hongyi Yu who mainly working on Interlab as well as doing research for the experiment plans. As a freshman, I have a lot to learn, not only the knowledge but also the standard protocols in the lab. Thanks to my team members, I’ve improved a lot during the last few months. I will try my best to help with our project on water bears. It’s great to get involved in the iGEM, but the most important thing is the unique experience!
I am Ian, a new member of SIAT-SCIE to take part in the iGEM this year. To satisfy the dream of childhood, creating my own organism, I took part in the iGEM lab works. However, I am not very familiar with the basic knowledge in synthetic biology, I need to learn a lot from textbooks, and papers. I know that I will also learn a lot of new, valuable knowledge from the lab and my teammates. To achieve a prize in the competition is the common goal of all the team and I am also not the exception.
I am Lai Peng from team SIAT-SCIE.I am in charge of the design of our website and some illustration. I like this kind of work from the bottom of my heart, maybe that's because I am an art student. This is the first time I have ever tried web design thus I will try my utmost to learn more knowledge about web design and synthetic biology to make our website more elaborate and special.
I am Huantong Chen from team SIAT-SCIE. I am one of the members who were mainly in charge of the wet lab work. Being a senior member in the team, I will contribute as much knowledge of synthetic biology as possible to our project. This is the first time that I do such a lot lab work, and I hope I can get invaluable experience during the work and together, we can accomplish our exciting project.
Hi, I’m Zeng Junyi. I like shrikes and bubble milk tea without sugar. I joined the team aiming to work in the lab but ended up making illustrations for the website. Anyway, It has been a pleasure working with my team members - they’re brilliant in their respective fields and I thank them for enduring my stupidity at times.
Hi, I'm Alexis. This is my first experience with iGEM, I couldn't be more excited about it. Throughout the preparation of the competition, I have learned much more about genetics and got to know this magnificent micro world. Later the experiment part provides us with a perfect opportunity to put the knowledge we learned into practice, therefore I have the chance to study how to use the precise instruments.  I believe that we are going to have an unforgettable experience with iGEM.
I joined the IGEM Club in our school one year ago and learn some basic knowledge of DNA Structure and central dogma. It was not until a few months ago I first entered the laboratory and began the practice. Doing experiments can be very time-consuming, I’ve experienced many times that whole-day effort being ruined by a tiny mistake.However, when we finally saw the desired result, all our effort paid off. The whole procedure and that sense of achievement motive me to keep on walking on this biological way.
I am Wendy in our SIATxSCIE iGEM lab group. As an inexperienced newcomer, I am still doing some very light works in the lab, mainly serving as a helping hand for the other seniors on our team. The mechanisms and theories behind most experiment designs I’m still catching up with. For my own biology career orientation, I would like to work in the Bioinformatics field and work on technologies that will be able to help biologists explore further, and operate simpler.

My name is Qian Chen. I’m a PhD student of Center for Synthetic Biology Engineering Research (CSynBER)，Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology，Chinese Academy of Sciences. My major is Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. SIAT✖️SCIE is an amazing team and all members are motivated. Their noval ideas will definitely impress you.
Hi everyone                     I am Feng Yu from Nanjing University. I am the website advisor of the team. I like the whole wiki team for them all lively smart and most importantly handsome XD. As I have taught my roommate a little bit on webpage creation who built Nanjing-China’s wiki last year. I hope my experience can help these teenagers finish such awesome wiki.
