Colonies present on pCat plate: Overnights made from these cultures.
0.8% w/v agarose gel ran of uncut BBa_J23119 vs cut BBa_J23119. Against a 1 kb ladder. 5µl of the ladder was loaded into the first well and 15µl of each sample of the 2nd and third wells.
Plasmid DNA was retrieved from the distribution kit and mini-prepped. The concentration of the plasmid DNA was checked using a nano-drop apparatus and was detected as 22ng/µl of nucleic acids.
A restriction digest was carried out using Ecor1 and Pst1 to cut the plasmid seen below into fragments of 77BP and 2,028BP, which can be seen visualised on the gel to the right versus the uncut plasmid.

K592012 - 716BP and 2,155BP
K592009 - 704BP and 2,155BP
Strange results obtained. Possible reasons for fragments of approximately 2000bp seen:
One of the restriction enzymes, EcoR1 or PstI, did not cut the ligated plasmid since the restriction sites might have been destroyed during ligation

OD600 - 0.799 @ T=0 of Cells.
Ran same six concentrations 2.5µg/L → 0.005µg/L verses blank LB versus a constitutively expressed GFP (BBa_K84001). Also included was a negative control of cells that did not express GFP so we used an overnight of cells for (BBa_K145201).
Experiment:
Ligation of TetR with Promoter-RFP using the Standard Assembly method. This vector will be tested with various concentrations of tetracycline and its fluorescence measured.
Plasmid prep of the samples:
TetR (BBa_K145201) : 113ng/microL
Promoter.RFP (BBa_I13521) : 50ng/microL
Restriction digest:
TetR with EcoR1, Spe1

Ligation  of TetR + Pro-RFP. Transformation of the ligated plasmid.
Plasmid preps of the overnights : AmilCP and mCherry.
Wednesday
-Gel extraction of TetR gene - try to increase purity and yield.  Methods to increase yield of DNA from gel extraction:
Wash DNA with ethanol multiple times - to remove salt residues
Make sure all ethanol is gone from DNA - run a gel check on the gel extracted DNA. If the sample floats out of the well you have ethanol contamination.
Elute with hot buffer (70°C)  and allow the column to incubate with the hot buffer for 5 minutes prior centrifugation
Renature the DNA - If the eluted DNA appears to be half the expected size then it is single stranded. Renature DNA by heating it to 95 degrees for a minute and let it cool slowly to room temperature.
Run controls - Digest empty vector cut with a single enzyme, perform the gel extraction, and re-ligate it. A vector cut with one enzyme should re-ligate very easily and provide plenty of colonies on the plate. If it does, then the inability to clone the DNA may be related to some other factor, such as secondary structure of the DNA, repeat sequences causing instability in E.coli, or the DNA cloned codes for a protein that may be toxic in bacteria.
Minimize exposure to UV light
Trim the gel slice as much as possible
-Ligated cultures grew with no RFP signal - TetR repressor protein is preventing the production of RFP. Overnights were made of this cultures.
Thursday

Made Tetracycline plates
Thursday

From this, 300microL mixed with 2.7mL of m9 and OD measured. 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3 dilutions made taking from the 1mL and plated. Colonies will be counted tomorrow and number correlated with the dilution.
Friday
PCRed up the iGEM linearized backbones
Ran these samples on a gel to confirm the PCR worked
Transformed two plasmids into DH5A E.coli via heat-shock : GFP producing plasmid and a plasmid containing a constitutive promoter. These plasmids will be ligated next week to form a constitutively producing GFP plasmid.
Week 9: 21st of August
Monday
Made overnights in M9 and LB of AmilCP, Church plasmid, and in m9 controls (Cells only, promoter J23119 plasmid, and Yensi’s GFP inducible control).
Poured Tetracycline plates and completed making new M9 media
Decided on a protocol for Tuesday’s experiments and laid out hood
Tuesday
Experiment to measure the Church GFP fluorescence vs the Erythromycin concentration
Measured the OD’s of the overnights. The OD’s were as follows:
Refreshed the cells in new M9 media and adjusted their OD’s to 0.05. Placed in a 50mL tube and left shaking for 3hrs.
After 3 hrs the OD’s were as follows:
Got a clear bottomed dark plate and pipetted the respective cells into each well. Added the correct concentration of Erythromycin to each well.
Fig. 1. Graph showing average fluorescence of Negative control (Cam resistant bacteria expressing promoter), 0.04µg/mL Erythromycin (Legal limit concentration) and 40µg/mL Erythromycin (Highest concentration used. Average fluorescence is average fluorescence over three replicates minus blank.
Fig. 2. Graph showing all average results. As seen, IPTG induced GFP strain is unsuitable as a positive control due to expression levels far above that of other strains used, drowning out their signals.
Fig. 3. Graph showing fluorescence response to all Erythromycin concentrations minus the positive control.
Experiment was carried out with a lid on the 96 well plate to prevent evaporation of the samples. It was found afterwards that the lid is a significant source of autofluorescence. As seen from the graphs, the negative control has a higher RFU than all of the samples excluding the highest concentration of Erythromycin used (40µg/mL). This was possibly due to the lid.
Wednesday
Refreshed overnights (AmilCP M9 1%, Cells only, promoter J23119) and made to an OD of 0.05.
Began AmilCP test on the plate reader. This test will examine the rate of AmilCP production vs the OD of the cells.
Discovered that the lid of the plate reader fluoresces in the plate reader.. This causes an error in our GFP results.
Made overnights of TetR and RFP. These constructs will be used to make a new ligated TetR-RFP construct to use as our tetracycline biosensor.
Thursday
Ran a gel on the pure resuspended gblocks to confirm that there is no contamination between gblocks.
It seems like there is some sort of contamination in the pure gblocks or the primers are binding and amplifying other sites??
A gel extraction may have to be carried out to get the correct gblocks.
3A Assembly of TetR-RFP plasmid:
Plasmid prep of the TetR and RFP respectively. Measured conc. And purity on nanodrop.
Restriction digest of the fragments using the 3A restriction enzymes
Ran the digest on a gel to confirm the digest worked:

Transformed cells with the new ligated TetR-RFP plasmid.
