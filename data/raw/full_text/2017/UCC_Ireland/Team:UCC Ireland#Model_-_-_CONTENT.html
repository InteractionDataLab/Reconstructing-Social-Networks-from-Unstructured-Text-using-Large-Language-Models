This system of 7 differential equations does not have an analytical solution, so we needed to implement some numerical methods.
</P><P class="large">
To simulate this system of Ordinary Differential Equations I used the 4
th order Runge-Kutta
method to provide a numerical solution. I implemented this method in Python, and all my
code will be made available in a GitHub repository which can be found on the UCC iGEM
2017 Wiki.
I ran the simulation for a time of 30 seconds, using 10000 time steps.
Since some of the rate constants were unknown, I ran the system for a variety of different
values, eventually arriving at constants which produced favourable results when graphed.
Since Biological and Chemical Systems are inherently going to possess some sort of
randomness, I also simulated the model using the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm in
MATLAB. This Algorithm describes the system in terms of the time evolution of probability
distributions. </P><H3>Numerical Solution: 4th order Runge-Kutta method, no initial Tetracycline Solution in the system:</H3><H3>Numerical Solution: 4th order Runge-Kutta method, 2000μg of Tetracycline Solution in the system:</H3><H3>Numerical Solution: Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, no initial Tetracycline Solution in the system:</H3><H3>Numerical Solution: Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, 2000μg of Tetracycline Solution in the system:</H3><H2>Results</H2><P class="large">
Results were quite favourable. The output of the graphs matched what we expected to
happen in our system quite well. When there was no Tetracycline in the system, there was
little to no AmilCP produced in the simulation.
</P><P class="large">
When we have Tetracycline present in the system we see an
increase in the amount of AmilCP Produced compared to when there was no Tetracycline in
the system. The Stochastic simulation, which takes into account the randomness of the system
approximately follows the same curves as when the Runge-Kutta method was used, leading
us to believe that the Stochastic solution converges to the solution obtained when using the
Runge-Kutta method.
</P><P class="large">
This model was then used by the team to predict how much AmilCP will be produced in
the system for different concentrations of Tetracycline, and thus provides us with a method
for quantifying the readout of our biosensor.
