project; local dairy farmers and a micro-distiller. By contacting local dairy
farmers we were granted an insight into how our project be applied in
their work. A biosensor that can detect antibiotics precisely, quickly and
inexpensively would take great pressure off farmers, who would worry
that their home tests were inadequate, causing penalties from regulatory
authorities. Our goal to create an easily accessible biosensor for
antibiotic contamination in food products such a milk would provide a
benefit to producers in less developed or regulated countries to test their
produce with an ultimate goal to reduce antibiotics in the human food
chain. With methanol poisoning still a worldwide cause of death and
disability, producing a similarly inexpensive and accessible biosensor for
methanol could save lives. Both deemed our projects ethical and of
potential benefit regarding regulations and healthcare.</P><H2>Integrated Human Practices:</H2><H3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Environment &amp; Sustainability</H3><P class="large">We believe that our project would in the long run be a more eco-friendly
alternative to the some of the “use and throw” tests currently employed by
our target market. The slider device which is used has a rechargeable
battery and our overall system will not result in any biohazard released into
the environment. The slider device can be reused continuously so will add
to the sustainability of our product.</P><H3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Social Justice</H3><P class="large">Upon contacting local dairy farmers, we were informed that even if there is
accidental contamination of milk (for example when one farmer’s cow
managed to drink a bucket of anti-biotic contaminated milk that was due to
be discarded!) or through a faulty detection test, the farmer will incur heavy
penalties. Our product aims to be more accurate and inexpensive to
prevent unjust costs on these farmers.
We also determined that by making a more accessible test for methanol,
we could allow more entry to the market as some regulators won’t allow the
alcohol to be sold without a safe test (testing by taste was not exactly an
approved method!). As identified by BordBia, taxation alone impedes entry
to the market to starter companies, so any way to lower the cost can help.</P><H3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Collaboration</H3><P class="large">We skyped iGEM teams in Newcastle and Exeter, and exchanged
information about cell free systems and our methods with EFPL
Switzerland.</P><H3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Integrated Human Practices</H3><P class="large">We got in contact with a representative from Anú dairy who provided us
with in depth information about the regulations in Ireland and the EU
around the testing and production of antibiotic free milk. He also provided
us with feedback on what his company would think of our project. This new
shareholder came to see our lab and the work that we were doing there, so
that he could report back and see what his colleagues in the company
thought.</P><H3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;">Outreach and Community Engagement</H3><P class="large">Team members Chloë, Ellen and Brandon joined up with the Cell
Explorers, a community who’s aim is to get children at primary level
interested in biochemistry. After being trained by the Cell Explorers from
NUIG, the Cell Explorers from UCC attended the local Glasheen Boy’s
school to show them how to extract DNA from bananas, and teaching
the boys the basics of cell biology.
Our team also gave informative talks to our own Universtity students,
speaking the members of the school of pharmacy and school of
biochemistry on different occasions about what our research entailed.
A poster of the mathematical modelling results was presented to the
college of Science, Engineering and Food Science in UCC to encourage
mathematical students to consider bioinformatics.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
