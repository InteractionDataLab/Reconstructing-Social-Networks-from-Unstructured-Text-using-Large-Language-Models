Resuspended primers
Diluted primers down to a  concentration of 10microM
Made up fresh M9, LB agar and LB broth.
Made fresh Cam and Amp plates.
Plated more Church plasmid cultures and ligated Tet cultures.
PCRed up Erythromycin, Mdh and FrmR g-blocks with primers to add correct adapters.
Ran a gel to confirm that the PCR worked successfully.
Received PRSF-duet backbone.
Visited Blackwater gin microdistillery in Waterford
Tuesday-15/08/17
Restriction digestion of the Prsf-duet backbone with Acl1 enzyme.
Ran a gel to confirm the digestion worked
New primers designed and ordered.
Wednesday-16/08/17
Set up the growth curve experiment using ligated TetR-RFP and Church plasmid. Put in plate reader overnight shaking.
Ran the PCR experiment of the gblocks a final time - Strange results?? - Confirmed that primers are incorrect.
Made Tetracycline plates
Thursday-17/08/17
Growth curve experiment examined. Here are the results:
Experiment testing the OD of the amilCP cells at T0, T1.5, T3, T4.5, T6. Cells left shaking in a flask. 1mL taken from the flask at the various time points. From this, 300microL mixed with 2.7mL of m9 and OD measured. 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3 dilutions made taking from the 1mL and plated. Colonies will be counted tomorrow and number correlated with the dilution.
Friday-18/08/17
PCRed up the iGEM linearized backbones
Ran these samples on a gel to confirm the PCR worked
Transformed two plasmids into DH5A E.coli via heat-shock : GFP producing plasmid and a plasmid containing a constitutive promoter. These plasmids will be ligated next week to form a constitutively producing GFP plasmid.
