What were we modelling?
When designing our biosensor we had two important features to consider: speed, and accuracy. The legal antiobiotic and methanol threshold is so small that our Biosensor had to be extremely accurate, but we also needed it to be fast as this is our Unique Selling Point over other available alternatives.
We decided to use mathematical modelling to deepen our understanding of what exactly was going on in our system without conducting an enormous amount of laboratory experiments, which would be both costly and time consuming.
