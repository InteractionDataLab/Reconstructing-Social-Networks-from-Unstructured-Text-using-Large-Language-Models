and students in UCC. They are specialists in aiding start-ups to build an effective business
plan, overcome obstacles and grow their business.
Our iGEM team identified Blackstone Launchpad as excellent potential mentors, to aid us
with building out the idea of our biosensor project, effectively carrying out market research
and aiding us in our presentation and outreach skills.
This turned out to be the case as Peter, Alexis and Trish’s experience proved invaluable in
each of these areas (pictures below). While our iGEM team was made up of multidisciplinary
students, none of us were from a business background and we had very little experience in
this area. Blackstone Launchpad’s expertise helped us more effectively gather and analyse
the market research behind our project. Their help in building out our project idea and
project plan was immensely useful and streamlined our work together as a team, making
accomplishing tasks much more efficient.
Their experience in aiding start-ups to build effective pitches and presentations, we found,
proved to be one of their greatest contributions to our team. They gave us the confidence
and skills to present clearly and effectively and this was a major bonus to our team.
Additionally, the fact that they’re backgrounds were in business rather than science, helped
us to avoid the pitfalls of using overcomplicated and scientific language when presenting,
one of the key aspects when presenting a project to an audience that know nothing about it.
UCC iGEM would like to thank Peter, Alexis and Trish for all their help throughout our iGEM
project, without which our project would have run less smoothly.</P></H1></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
