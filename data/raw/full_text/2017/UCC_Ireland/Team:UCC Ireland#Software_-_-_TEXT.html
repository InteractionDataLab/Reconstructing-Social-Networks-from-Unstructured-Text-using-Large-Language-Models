Our MOOnSHINE app analyses the output from our slider device, which is either captured by the camera in app or chosen from the gallery, if a sample was taken earlier.
The app reads the
red
or
green
values from the captured image, and calculates the concentration of either methanol or antibiotics, using our calibrated mathematical models. An easy to read output, along with a link to an exterior page that gives more information about the relevant test, allows a user to test their samples with ease.
