Hardware This year we constructed two series of hardware to control the light. One is built based on the published paper [1]. The model is designed to prevent leakage of light, and the control             of light is simplified according to experimental needs. You can choose to use 620nm (blue 1W/m2), 670 (nm 1.05             W/m2 ) or 540 (nm 4.03 W/m2) according to different experimental needs. The light intensity can be regulated ranging             from 0~3000lux and the period of light illumination can be modified. The working demonstration video is as following.
Another is similar to the former one but this one is designed for lightening the microfluidic chips. The working             demonstration video is shown as following.
