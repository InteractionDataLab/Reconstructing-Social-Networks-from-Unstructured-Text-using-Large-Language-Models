Demonstration The project of this year is to implement a computer-controlled cell cycle. To demonstrate this, a simple repression             on replication is not enough, a reverse regulation is necessary for proving that our project works. So after             an OD measurement, a further demonstration of reverse regulation is conducted by applying qPCR.
At last, we demonstrate that this system can be reverse regulated, which is essential for the concept of computer             control. At the same time, our software and hardware are ready for the 4C project.

Summarizing all above, we believe that we accomplished a computer-controlled cell cycle synchronizer.
Award
We finally achieved the Gold Medal!
