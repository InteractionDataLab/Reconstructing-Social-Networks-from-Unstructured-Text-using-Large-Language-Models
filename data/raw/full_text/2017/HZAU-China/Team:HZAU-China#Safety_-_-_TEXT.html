Safty We have finished all of the safety forms: General safety matters:
In our lab there is a safety training for everyone which covered following aspects: 1. Personal prospective wear: lab coat and gloves must be worn all the time during work,Personnel must wash their             hands after experiments, and before they leave the laboratory working areas. Open-toed footwear must not be worn             in laboratories. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics, handling contact lenses and sleeping is prohibited             in the laboratory working areas. 2. Chemical safety: we have printed “Dos and don’ts when using hazardous chemicals” and posted them on marked place. GMO safety: no biology materials are allowed to bring out of our lab and biology waste must be put to bacterial waste. GMO safety: no biology materials are allowed to bring out of our lab and biology waste must be put to bacterial waste. Studying biosafety: we have also listed some websites of biosafety for our teammates to study: Govern biosafety in research laboratories: GMO safety: no biology materials are allowed to bring out of our lab and biology waste must be put to bacterial waste. china http://www.stee.agri.gov.cn/biosafety/ http://english.biosafety.gov.cn/ Biosafety guidelines of our institution: http://swx.hzau.edu.cn/ http://bw.hzau.edu.cn/zc_detail.asp?id=196 Regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories: http://www.stee.agri.gov.cn/biosafety/ http://english.biosafety.gov.cn/ Our lab
Our lab locates in the building of college of life science and technology in Huazhong Agricultural.This year,our             lab have been transfered from the third floor to first floor where the working place is much spacious.
