Zhujun Xia
I'm Shane, the most brilliant member in the lab. Our team members call me teacher Xia, because I taught many                     freshmen to do experiment. My idol is Jennifer Doudna. I take charge of work in wet lab where I met many                     interesting people. I hope we can have a chance to discover the world in the future.
He Yang
Hello, My name is He Yang, majoring in bioengineer. This is my first time to participate in iGEM. I am good                     at playing piano and practicing China traditional martial arts. I am also interested in learning everything                     in lab. The past year in HZAU-China I gained valuable knowledge and friendship. I believe we'll achieve                     good results this year.
Songtao Cheng
Hello! My name is Songtao Cheng. It's my first year to be an iGEMer. During the iGEM project I found that                     synthetic biology is so charming. Joining iGEM is a good chance for me to learn knowledge and communicate                     with creative people to broaden my horizon. In short, I enjoy it!
Yingjie Geng
My name is Yingjie Geng. It is a great pleasure for me to be a member of HZAU-iGEM experiment group. My major                     contribution is to test the protein expression of the pMag-split dCas9 and nMag-split dcas9, verify the                     light-induced dimerization protein function by luciferase assay. I'm very happy to talk with others about                     experimental design. So feel free to contact me.
Zhiqing Guo
My name is Zhiqing Guo. I am a sophomore student now at HZAU. My hobby is widespread, such as reading, listening                     to music, singing and watching anime. I am dreaming that I will be a super scientist saving the world.
Zhangcheng Ding
I'm a senior student in HZAU. My main job in the team is focusing on the result verification, most on the                     flow cytometry actually. It's my honour to participate in the competition which helped me to understand                     biology better. It's really nice to work with my partners.
Bincan He
It's so serious that I don't know what to say. Em, I'm Bincan He, an amusing girl.
Yini Miao
A girl who majors in Bioinformatics has great interest in biology and wants to be the force of it one day.
Qiqi Xiong
Hi, I am a junior student from HZAU and it's my second year in HZAU-iGEM team. This year I worked as a member                     of Wet Lab in our project. Hope our studys can lead a promising prospect in controlling cells to be synchronized                     by optical control system.
Jinyu Wang
I'm jinyu wang, a boy who likes animals. I'm a HZAU-iGEMer, I'm working for the things I'm eager to work                     for life. So I'm always happy.
Wenqi Huang
You can call me Johnson Huang, and I am a senior student majoring in Biotechnology. Every French soldier                     carries a marshal's baton in his knapsack, and I'm definitely not a French soldier. But anyway, the marvel                     projects in iGEM always inspire me a lot and this year in iGEM I learned a lot as a team leader. Feel                     free to contact me if you have any question about our project.
Yinqing Zeng
I am Yinqing Zeng and my major is biotech. I like to conduct my experiment because it can make my concentration.                     I love this team and I hope what I learn this year could be uesful for them in the future. In another                     hand, my dream is opening a dessert shop though I don't like eating dessert.
Haimeng Li
Hello! My name is Haimeng Li, I'm from a beautiful coastal city. My major is bioscience. I like doing experiments.                     I am the head of human practice but responsible for logistics of the team. I'm very glad to join in this                     competition to enrich my university life.
Anqi Zhou
Hi, I'm Anqi Zhou, a member of wet experiment group. This year, it is my second time attending iGEM. After                     two years working with iGEMers, I gain happiness and friendship, also get attracted by the fascination                     of synthetic biology which may be my future reseach field. It's a long way to be a exellent SynBiology                     scientist but I would put in my best effort.
Weitong Guo

Binguang Ma
Prof. Ma is our direct instructor. He has seen us through thick and thin, and has been with us in times of                     happiness and sorrow. His field of research is systems biology and synthetic biology, and this time,                     the inspiration of our project is from him. We all love him, for he is not only our instructor, but also                     our friends.
