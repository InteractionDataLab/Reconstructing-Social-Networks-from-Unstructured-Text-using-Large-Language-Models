            site, oriC. But it brings us three questions:</A><A class="zhengwen" style="margin-left: 40px;">A. What would happen if we block the chromosome replication?</A><A class="zhengwen" style="margin-left: 40px;">B. Can we mathematically describe this abnormal process?</A><A class="zhengwen" style="margin-left: 40px;">C. Is this approach effective enough to control cell cycle?</A><A class="zhengwen">After Dry Lab’s analysis, we found that blocking oriC is well enough to control cell cycle, and even better since
            the initiation nearly determines the cell cycle. </A><A class="zhengwen">How to observe replication procession in real-time?</A><A class="zhengwen">Limited by experimental apparatus, we couldn’t observe the replication procession in single cell directly. So Dry
            Lab have to build a model based on a series of previously published rules to describe the coordination among
            chromosome replication, cell growth and division.</A><A class="zhengwen">So here comes three main goals of modeling this year: </A><A class="zhengwen" style="margin-left: 40px;">A. Improving model to mathematical formula.</A><A class="zhengwen" style="margin-left: 40px;">B. Solving the paradox, that a cell can’t grow in exponential rate after blocking replication, emerged during simulation
            by defining a new parameter “d” to supply it.</A><A class="zhengwen" style="margin-left: 40px;">C. Inferring the internal replication procession only by volume.</A><A class="zhengwen">In the process of modeling, we encountered many challenges, such as bacteria initiates multi-replication process
            during one cycle. According to reference, it is very difficult to be mathematically formulated, but with some
            smart trick we can formulate it into a mathematical function. </A><A class="zhengwen">Figure 1. The different stages of synchronization. Ton: the light triggering the synchronization system is on. And
            CRISPER system will block oriC. Tr1: It won’t exert any effect when oriC is not blocked since it can’t initiate
            new replication fork. Ts：time of becoming single chromosome. </A><A class="zhengwen">Figure 2. The different stages of the bacteria returning to normal. Toff: the time it takes from turning off the
            light to oriC is unblocked. Tr2: time it takes for the bacteria returning to the normal state since Oric is unblocked.</A><A class="fubiaoti">Section A: volume and replication model</A><A class="zhengwen">There’s a lot of attributes for a single bacterium such as volume, weight, concentration of different kinds of proteins
            and RNA, the amount of DNA and etc., but the accurate concentration of these things can’t be directly detected
            due to limited experimental condition. This is a huge obstacle for the modeling’s accuracy. After discussion,
            we find that though the concentration of dCas9 and gRNA of the single bacteria can’t be directly acquired, the
            volume of cell can be the easiest and most accurate parameter we can get. So that our project can be evaluated
            on single cell level other than a whole bunch of colony just because we took the advantage of the volume of the
            bacteria which is totally measurable and reliable.
        </A><A class="zhengwen"> Thus we improved our previous work, made it formulized and capable to be put into software. We read some paper in
            the relevant research field and summarized some rules of bacterial replication growth and division, and applied
            them in our project. The rules are as following:</A><A class="zhengwen_disblock">Bacterial rule of growth: </A><A>$V_{new} =V_{old}e^{\mu T}$</A><A class="zhengwen_disblock">Bacterial rule of triggering replication initiation: </A><A>$V&gt;2^{N}V_{std}$</A><A class="zhengwen_disblock">Bacteria will divide after C phase and D phase: </A><A class="HZAU_gongshi">$T_{C}+T_{D}$</A><A class="zhengwen">Figure 3.
