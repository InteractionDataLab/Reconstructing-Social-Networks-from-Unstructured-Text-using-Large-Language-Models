We brought the number of subjects back to a short list of ten. This was still a lot, so we cancelled seven subjects. We made subgroups and every subgroup researched one of the three projects left. After the presentations of every topic we took a vote.
  
We decided to work on a DNA detector device using the CRISPR Cas9 system. Later we decided to primarily focus on the detection of bacteriophages in the dairy industry. The day organized by the Rathenau Institute helped us to make this decision. It makes the project more visible for the public and gives the ability to contact specific companies.
