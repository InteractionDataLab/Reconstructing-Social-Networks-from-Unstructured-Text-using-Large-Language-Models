Fun Activities
Utrecht Party - 26 August
We had a great evening with all the Dutch iGEM teams in Utrecht. We went out for dinner and had drinks afterwards at Pamela Capendale's place (thanks!;). It was a lot of fun and we had a great time!
Team Weekend - 14-16 July
We had a nice team weekend near the lake Leekstermeer. With the whole team we rented a bungalow at the Cnossen camping. We played games and had drinks plus we went sailing on the lake itself :). Since we will be spending a large part of our summer together, we judged it to be a good teambuilding exercise to meet the other team members in a different context and just enjoy some quality time together
Dinner
Quite often, we had dinner together as a team. To discuss our project?- of course! But also for the fun of it. The best ideas originate with food and drinks, wouldn't you agree?
BBQ and fundraiser - 20th of September
On the 20th of September we organized a BBQ and fundraiser. We used this event to raise money for our project and to explain our research to our family, friends, fellow students and other scientists from molecular biology.
