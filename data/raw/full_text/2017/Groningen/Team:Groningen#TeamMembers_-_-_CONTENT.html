I'm Floor and I am the chairwoman of the IGEM Groningen 2017 team. I'm also working on acquisition and human practices.

If you want to know more about the smallest creatures of life, I’m always available for a nice chat. Maybe that’s why I’m responsible for the outreach of our project. To me the project would be successful if I’m able to give an insight into synthetic biology, to all levels of society. Next to iGEM and studying I give guest lectures at high schools and I give tutoring. 
        But it’s not all about the brain! I also like to play korfball. It’s a typical Dutch sport, looks a bit like basketball, but the more fun part is… we play with men and women together.

        I also am a frequent visitor of Narnia and a member of the board of governance in hogwarts. I like sarcasms, lists, unnecessary comments, politics and synthetic biology.
        If I do not get the invitation to Hogwarts, I would like to either do my Phd in synthetic biology or be a kitesurf instructor for a while in South Africa.

I am Mart and I study molecular biology and some chemistry. I am really interested in how life functions at molecular level and how we can manipulate these molecules to perform useful tasks. Other interests of mine are experimenting with (molecular) cooking and sports. I joined the IGEM team, because I think it is a great learning opportunity and to share my interest with synthetic biology with other people.

        My name is Adaugo. I mostly go by Ada because it’s less of a mouthful and easier to pronounce. To introduce myself, I’ll give you a glimpse into my life because what better way to introduce myself? -Or maybe I just don’t have any better ideas;). I am a Christian, and I’m Nigerian. I like dancing, though my choreography is always out of sync. I like cooking good food, and I like eating it even better. The more people there are, the merrier. When cooking for myself, I mostly stick to pasta and rice- less hassle, or maybe I’m just not very adventurous with food. Oh and by the way, I happen to be the secretary of this awesome iGEM team:).

I just finished my bachelor degree and next year I hope to start with my master in molecular biology. Since I got some extra time this summer and because I want to learn more about biomolecular research. I am part of the research group of our team and will help with the lab work.

Almost done with the Topmaster programme in Nanoscience, my interests have always been broad. I play badminton in my free time and I have my own company in game development. I like cheap tasty food that’s quick to make but I’ll make a real effort for special occasions. iGem sounded like fun so I figured I’d join, which is the best way to make decisions in your life.

           I'm Joana, a bachelor student Life Science and Technology in Groningen and, of course, IGEM-GRONINGEN 2017 team member! Among others, I am responsible for gaining the support from companies and institutes for our project. In addition, I also help out with the outreach of our project and with the lab work. When I am not in the lab, I enjoy living the student life in Groningen while trying to undertake as many foreign trips as possible.
