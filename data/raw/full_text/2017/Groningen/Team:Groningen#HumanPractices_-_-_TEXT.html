HUMAN PRACTICES
Overview
Human Practices
Our final product is geared towards the dairy industry, towards making a product that would essentially help to increase the yield and efficiency of for example cheese. In order to create a relevant product which would actually be useful in the current industry, we discussed with some of the biggest stakeholders in the dairy industries, mainly within the Netherlands. We also discussed with ethics experts, government organizations and communication experts. In our discussion with the stakeholders and experts, we did not only discuss the ideas which would make our product relevant in the dairy industry, we also discussed the safety of our product. To read about our discussions with them, please visit our Human Practices Silver page.
Based on our discussions, we continued to build on the model for our final product and tweaking parts in order to ensure that the final product is very safe, and does not  bring GMO’s in contact with food. Discussions with the industry stakeholders helped shape our final product, and to make it in the best possible way to be both safe and relevant. To see the exact details of each discussion we had, and how it helped build our product either by making us consider a different aspect or by helping us streamline or project to fill up a needed area please see our Integrated Human Practices page.
In addition to learning facts which helped us tweak our experiments and final product in  the right direction, we also had a lot of fun and learnt a lot while engaging with the general public. We were present during multiple public events and educated many different groups in society. In collaboration with the RIVM (Government Institute for Health and Environment) we designed a game regarding ‘Thinking Before Doing’ regarding to synthetic biology. To learn more, go to our Public Engagement page.
Originally, our Human practices began as a way to fulfill the iGEM requirement of considering the implications of our product beyond the lab. Somewhere along the line, we began to enjoy it- to look forward to the conversations, engagements, and going beyond the minimum to actually form connections and maximize the positive potential of our product for all. We enjoyed all our conversations and visits, and we enjoyed putting it together and making a story for this wiki. We hope you enjoy reading about our Human practices journey as much as we enjoyed the journey itself.
