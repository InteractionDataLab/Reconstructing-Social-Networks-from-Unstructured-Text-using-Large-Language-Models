BioBrick Part in BioBrick plasmid (Purified DNA, > 16ng/μl)
dH2O
NEB Buffer 2
BSA
Restriction Enzymes: EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI
Procedure
Add 250ng of DNA to be digested, and adjust with dH20 for a total volume of 16 μl
Add 2.5 μl of NEBuffer 2.1
Check here for buffer selection (depending on the enzyme)
Add 0.5 μl of BSA
Add 0.5 μl of EcoRI
Add 0.5 μl of PstI
There should be a total volume of 20 μl. Mix well and spin down briefly
Incubate the restriction digest at 37°C for 30 min
If prevention of self-ligation of backbone is recommended: add 0.5 μl alkaline phosphatase and incubate for another 20 min 37°C.
Incubate at 80°C for 20 min to heat kill the enzymes. We incubate in a thermal cycler with a heated lid
Run a portion of the digest on a gel (8 μl, 100ng), to check that both plasmid backbone and part length are accurate.

Preparing competent E. coli DH5α cells
Materials
Plate or stock of E.coli DH5α cell
LB
TSS buffer
Ice
Procedure
Grow 5ml overnight culture of cells in LB media, dilute this culture back into 25-50ml of fresh LB media in a 200ml conical flask.
In the morning You should aim to dilute the overnight culture by at least 1/100.
Grow the diluted culture to an OD600 of 0.2 - 0.5. (You will get a very small pellet if you grow 25ml to OD600 0.2)
Put Eppendorf tubes on ice now so that they are cold when cells are aliquoted into them later. If your culture is X ml, you will need X tubes. At this point you should also make sure that your TSS is being cooled (it should be stored at 4°C but if you have just made it fresh then put it in an ice bath).
Split the culture into two 50ml falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 10 min.
All subsequent steps should be carried out at 4°C and the cells should be kept on ice whenever possible.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and 4°C.
Decant supernatant, remove leftover media by carefully pipetting
Resuspend in TSS buffer (10% of original volume), vortex gently
Add 100 μl aliquots to chilled Eppendorfs, flash freeze and store at – 80°C in 200 µl aliquots.

Pipet 1-100 ng of DNA as well as control into tubes and gently mix with tip
incubate on ice for 30 min, tubes may be gently flicked, return to ice ASAP
Meanwhile, for every transformation, add 2 µl of each SOC salt solution into 100 µl 2x SOC stock and ad to 200 µl with sterile MQ. Place the SOC medium on ice till use
Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 30 seconds (precisely)
Incubate on ice for 5 min
Add 200 µl of SOC medium to each transformation
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hours, shaker or rotor recommended
Pipet 20 µl & 200 µl transformation mixture onto petri plates and spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads. Let the plates dry near the flame before placing them in the incubator
Incubate plates upside down overnight (14-18hr) at 37°C
Pick single colonies

Procedure
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel
Weigh te gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100 mg ~ 100 µl). The maxiumum amount of gel per spin column is 400 mg. For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Vuffer QG
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The mixture turns yellow
Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min until all the samples have passed through the column. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. For sample volumes of >80 µl, load and spin again
To wash, add 750 µl Buffer PE to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back into the same tube. Note: If the DNA will be used for salt-sensitive applications (e.g., sequencing, bluntended ligation), let the column stand 2–5 min after addition of Buffer PE. Centrifuge the QIAquick column in the provided 2 ml collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0-8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel

Procedure
Pellet 1–5 ml bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation at >8000 rpm (6800 x g) for 3 min at room temperature (15–25°C).
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μl Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn blue.
Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times. If using LyseBlue reagent, the solution will turn colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
Apply the supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting. Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through.
Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 30–60 s and discard the flow-through. Transfer the QIAprep spin column to the collection tube.
Centrifuge for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.

Phenol-Chloroform DNA extraction
Materials
Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alchohol (25:24:1)
Mili-Q water
Eppendorf centrifuge
Chemical fume hood
Nitrile gloves
Eppendorf tubes
At least 100 μl sample (if you have 20 μl ligation, add 80 μl Mili-Q)
SpeedVac
Procedure
Warning: phenol can cause severe burns to the eyes and the skin. Chloroform is a volatile liquid that affects the central nervous system and a suspected human carcinogenic. It is very volatile and can cause damage by inhalation, skin and eyes absorption, and ingestion. Therefore, perform the whole procedure in a chemical fume hood and wear nitrile gloves (if accidental contact occurs, remove and discard contaminated gloves immediately)
Add one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to the sample.
Vortex vigorously for 1 minute.
Spin at 10.000g for 5 minutes. (to separate organic and aqueous phases)
Place the top aqueous solution in a new eppendorf tube and discard the organic bottom phase.
Note: Be careful do not pick up any of the phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol phase.
Repeat the above steps two times.
Now, you can concentrate the DNA sample by using SpeedVac or ethanol precipitation.

Ethanol DNA precipitation
Materials
100% cold ethanol
70% cold ethanol
Eppendorf centrifuge
Sodium acetate (3M) (pH 5.2)
MiliQ water or elution buffer
Eppendorf tubes
At least 100 μl sample (if you have 20 μl ligation, add 80 μl Mili-Q)
SpeedVac
Optional: glycogen
Procedure
Add 0.1x volume of sodium acetate and mix (no vortex)
Optional trick: add 1 μl of glycogen. Glycogen will co-precipate with the DNA and therefore, it will form a visible pellet and incease the recovery of DNA. It van be useful when you have small quantities of DNA.
Add 2.5x volume of 100% cold ethanol and mix (no vortex).
Incubate at -80 °C for at least 2 hours.
Spin at top speed for 15 minutes at 4°C.
Remove the supernatant carefully without touching the pellet.
Spin for some seconds and remove again the excess of supernatant.
Wash by adding 150 μl of 70% cold ethanol by carefully sliding the ethanol along the wall of the tube.
Spin at top speed for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Repeat the ethanol wash from step 8 twice.
Dry with SpeedVac.
Resuspend in the appropriate volume of MiliQ water or elution buffer.
