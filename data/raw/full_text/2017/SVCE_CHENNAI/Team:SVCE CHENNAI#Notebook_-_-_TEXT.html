The buffers necessary to carry out molecular biology works were prepared.
The Antibiotics stocks were prepared and their activity was checked.
2nd WEEK (8.6.17 – 14.6.17):
No lab work.
3rd WEEK (15.6.17 – 22.6.17):
Prepared the mother culture of E.Coli DH5α.
Optimization of Transformation using the Competent cells prepared using CCMB80 protocol.
Failure of transformation.
We thought that the problem was with buffer.
Optimization of transformation using the competent cells prepared using CaCl2 protocol.
Failure of transformation.Thought that the problem was with the culture.
4th WEEK (25.6.17 – 30.6.17):
Transformation using the competent cells E.Coli DH5α prepared using ccmb80 protocol and the cells from NEB kit.
Transformation using the cells from NEB kit was successful whereas transformation using the cells from our lab didn’t yield good results.
We confirmed that the problem was with the cells.
JULY 2017
1st WEEK (1.7.17 – 7.7.17):
Prepared the  pure culture of E.Coli  DH5α using macconkey agar and then subcultured.
Optimization of transformation using the E.Coli  DH5α.
Successfully transformation was optimized.
2nd WEEK (8.7.17 – 13.7.17):
PCR amplification of BBa_J04450 part and No amplification.
The problem was found to be with Primers & Primers were ordered.
Plasmid isolation of RFP from the transformed cells.
PCR  amplification of the isolated plasmid RFP  using the new primers.
No amplification. The problem may be due to enzyme.
PCR amplification of isolated plasmid RFP using master mix & The RFP was amplified.
3rd WEEK (14.7.17 – 20.7.17):
Optimization of restriction double digestion at E and P site.
Restricted sample was resolved in gel.
Ligation of the restricted sample with backbone.
Transformation of ligated product.
No growth was observed in the plate containing the cells with ligated product.
Ligation didn’t yield positive result.
4th WEEK (21.7.17 – 27.7.17):
PCR amplification of the gblock.
No amplification.
But the rfp which was kept as control got amplified.
PCR amplification of gblock ( adaptor with constitutive RBS ).
PCR amplification of the gblocks ( pH riboswitch ).
Multiple PCR amplification of pH riboswitch.

Optimization of transformation using ampicilin.
Blue white screening also performed.
Transformation was good but the efficiency was low.
We witnessed the problem may be with the cells.
The cells were revived.
The blue colonies was sub-cultured into the broth containing ampicillin.
OCTOBER 2017
1st WEEK ( 3.10.17 – 7.10.17 ):
Transformation using ampicillin was performed again since, the previous transformation hasn’t yield good results (low efficiency).
Transformation was performed again. Got good results with high efficiency.

Multiple PCR & PCR clean up was done.
The multiple PCR products were pooled in and restricted at E & P site.
Simultaneously linearized plasmid backbone ( pSB1C3 ) was also restricted.

Finally, the ligation was successful.
