 REC  UCL  LUND  Nawi_GRAZ  University of Sydney  Indian iGEM Meetup
REC – CHENNAI
Team REC_CHENNAI is a debut team in iGEM and it is for this reason that we decided to mentor them. From helping them design their gBlocks to troubleshooting experimental problems, we guided them in all possible ways by informing them about the intricacies of iGEM.In addition, we also collaborated with them and conducted the Biofair as part of our Human Practices. We also built a quorum sensing coupled temperature sensitive system for the contolled release of their anti-microbial peptide. We also provided them BL-21 and DHP-alpha strain.
UCL
Since neither of the teams had any prior experience in mathematical modelling, Team UCL and Team SVCE_CHENNAI regularly collaborated and sent each other useful resources on how to model biological pathways and reactions.
Once we started forming the reaction pathway, we exchanged our differential equations and parameter values. Then each team provided valuable feedback to the other as to how we could better our respective models while at the same time making the information that we provide easy for anyone to understand.
LUND
LUND played a key role in forming the reactions and differential equations for our mathematical model, as we were new to modeling and hence required help. They also made sure to guide us every step of the way during our whole modeling process and to check for any corrections while helping us to formulate our final model.
Nawi_GRAZ
Both the teams, NAWI_GRAZ and SVCE_CHENNAI  were working on pH as well as temperature regulatory systems, which provided an  avenue for collaboration. Since we had some issues with changing pH in our medium, NAWI_GRAZ team helped us out by giving us some useful suggestions. In-turn, they seeked our help in solving the precipitation issues that they had faced while preparing the M9 media. In addition to this, we also decided to test each others pH parts and compare the results obtained.
They characterized the alx system with both the promoter and the pH riboswitch, while we did it only with the riboswitch, this gave us an oppurtunity to compare the effect on pH sensitive regulation by the RNA thermometer and pH riboswitch.
University of Sydney
University of Sydney has helped us to troubleshoot the problems that we were facing with ligation. They suggested some ideas that aided in the improvement of the protocol that we followed and also pointed out some of the possible mistakes that we could be making while ligating  our parts. We were also provided with a protocol for troubleshooting ligations and transformations which enabled us to  optimize our protocols. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE PDF.
Indian iGEM Meet-up
We had the chance of meeting all the other Indian teams at the All India iGEM meet-up held at IISER Pune. Each team presented their project, received valuable feedback and explored various avenues of improvement. It was also good to know about the projects that the other teams were working on which helped us to consider the possible platforms for collaborating with them.
