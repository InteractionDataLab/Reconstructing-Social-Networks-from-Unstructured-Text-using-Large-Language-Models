REGULOGEM
With Our Adaptor Riboswitches Can Regulate through
_
Overview
Over the years synthetic biologists have used two types of regulators : transcriptional and translational.
They've always had this quandary of what to choose, as while transcriptional ones regulate multiple genes they are difficult to enginner and translational regulators are easy to engineer but regulate only a single gene.
Hence an ideal regulator would be great, but what would that be like?
Is it possible for a single part to have the best properties of transcriptional and translational regulator?
Is it possible for a regulator to be easily engineerable and at the same time regulate multiple genes?
In essence, can a single part have the best properties of both translational and transcriptional regulators while subverting their limitations?
The answer is YES. SVCEs 2017 iGEM team shall present such a regulator and charechterise it and make it available in the registry for future iGEMers to not fret over which type of regulator they want to use.
Brace yourselves as ReguloGEM - SVCE 2017 is here.
We used a part of the tna operon consisting of the leader peptide element(tnaC) and the rho-dependent terminator - which we call the adaptor Adaptor to convert the translational regulatory propeerty of the riboswitch into transcriptional regulation. This part was charechterized using a RNA thermometer and a pH riboswitch
