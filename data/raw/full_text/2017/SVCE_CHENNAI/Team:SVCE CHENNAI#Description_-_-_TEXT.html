ReguloGEM
Synthetic biologists over the years have used various transcriptional and translational regulators to control gene expression. While transcriptional regulators are composable and can be easily used to regulate the function of complex genetic circuits, they are difficult to engineer as their mechanism involves action on moving RNA polymerase and hence ill-defined kinetic and dynamic structural factors play a major role. On the other hand translational regulators can be easily engineered using predictive thermodynamic and kinetic models but are constrained to act on single genes and cannot be assembled into complex genetic circuits as translation initiation at RBS is a distributive process. Hence an ideal genetic regulator would be one that can be easily engineered and at the same time assembled into complex genetic circuits. SVCE’s 2017 iGEM team is focused on developing such a regulator using a segment of the Tryptophanase operon. This segment will function as an adaptor to convert translational regulation to transcriptional regulation and adopt the pros of both regulators while subverting their limitations. This adaptor will be characterized using the RNA thermometer that initiates translation at 420C and a pH riboswitch that intitates translation only at alkaline conditions. Additionally the RNA thermometer will be modified such that it is functional in Bacillus subtilis too as the part in the registry is only functional in Escherichia coli.
Software
We are also focused on deploying machine learning algorithms to the large amount of data available in the registry of standard biological parts – we have already developed a python based platform to predict the strength of σ70 promoters in Escherichia coli.
