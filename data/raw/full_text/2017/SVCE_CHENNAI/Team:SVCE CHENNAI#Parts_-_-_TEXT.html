OUR BEST BASIC PARTS
1.RNA pHmeter - Wild scar (BBa_K2379002) :
The RNA pHmeter consists of the SraF gene that functions as a pH-sensitive RNA element which will induce gene expression under alkaline conditions (pH 8.4). This part is a variant of the RNA pHmeter wherein the natural scar native to the SraF gene is conserved.
2.RNA pHmeter – Biobrick scar (BBa_K2379003):
This part is yet another variant of the RNA pHmeter wherein the natural scar is replaced with the conventional 6bp biobrick scar.The RNA pHmeter we provided had a 4bp natural scar region. Since the biobrick scar site has 6bp, we had issues in adapting it to the biobrick standard. To overcome this discrepancy, we worked on the effect of mutations in the RNA pHmeter, RNA design principles and the effect of varying the distance between Shine Dalgarno Sequence and start codon. With this, we were successfully able to engineer the pH riboswitch with a biobrick scar site that similar is in both thermodynamic properties and secondary structure to the wild type. Despite the modifications made in it’s gene sequence, the functionality of this part remained the same and the new part was validated in the lab too.                                                  Both of these parts will serve as a novel and valuable addition to the iGEM registry since there are currently no parts available in the latter for the regulation of translation based upon pH. Thus we submit these parts for this year’s iGEM competition for the award of BEST NEW BASIC PART.
RNA pH Meter
WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PART ?
This part regulates translation based on a pH stimulus. Hence, gene expression can be controlled to a larger extent by using this riboregulator. And this is crucial for the synthetic biology community as well as iGEM which aims at improving the quality of research through standard biological parts.

Composite Parts
OUR BEST COMPOSITE PARTS
1. ADAPTOR (TnaC + RUT) (BBa_K2379008):
An ideal genetic regulator that combines the best properties of both transcriptional and translational regulation. This part when placed downstream of any RNA element has the ability to convert it’s translational regulatory property into a transcriptional regulatory one.
Adaptor
1.A) RNA Thermometer + Adaptor + GFP (BBa_K2379010) :
This part is a modulation of the adaptor with a temperature- sensitive element (RNA Thermometer 4U ). By placing this RNA element upstream of the adaptor element ( TnaC + RUT) , it can be made to regulate transcription of the downstream genes at higher temperature( above 37ºC).
Adaptor with RNA Thermometer
1.B) RNA pHmeter+ Adaptor + GFP (BBa_K2379011):
This variation of the adaptor consists of the pH-responsive RNA element (RNA pHMETER) placed upstream of the TnaC and RUT site. By this way, the adaptor enables the RNA pHmeter to control transcription of downstream genes at alkaline pH (pH 8.4).
Adaptor with RNA pH Meter
This adaptor can be a powerful tool in the hands of any synthetic biologist who intends to convert the translational regulation of their RNA element into transcriptional regulation.This is because the adaptor possesses the ability to be easily engineered and as well regulate the expression of multiple genes under a single promoter. Hence we submit these parts to this year’s iGEM competition for the award of BEST COMPOSITE PART.
WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PART ?
OPERON REGULATION: Can control the expression of multiple genes under the influence of a single promoter and an RBS.
GENETIC LOGIC GATES REGULATION: Can be easily assembled into higher order function(Genetic logic gates and invivo computational devices)
METABOLIC ENGINEERING: Can be used to measure the FCC ( flux control coefficients) for several genes encoding for different enzymes that can be placed under a single promoter.
