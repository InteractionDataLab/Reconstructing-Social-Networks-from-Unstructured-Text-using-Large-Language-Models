Our Mentors
Arun Kumar
A member of the 2015 iGEM team and currently pursuing his Masters in Biology in LMU, Germany, he helped us with designing our experiments and standardizing our protocols.
Jayaprakash Srinivasan
Another member of  the 2015 iGEM team and currently pursuing a Masters degree in Molecular and Cell Biology in Heidelberg University, Germany, he has helped us with designing our experiments and provided a critical insight into designing principles of the RNA secondary structures.
Varshini Rajagopal
She was an intrinsic part of the 2015 & iGEM 2016 team and is currently pursuing her Masters degree in Molecular biology in Uppsala University, Sweden.This year she has mentored our team by guiding us in the lab , funding and also in the shipment of our chemicals and samples.
Vidya Srokshna
One of our mentors and the person behind the optimization and standardization of all our lab protocols, she has guided the team with her previous iGEM experience. Currently, she is pursuing her post graduate studies in biology in LMU, Germany.
Samudra Sabari
At present she is doing her Post graduate studies in Molecular Biology in Uppsala University, Sweden. She had participated in iGEM 2015 and 2016. With that experience, she guided us to carry out our HP works and also helped  us to complete the Interlab measurement studies.
We are grateful to:
Saksin life sciences Pvt Ltd for their immense support, who provided us with their plate reader and lab space for carrying out the expression studies. They also helped us optimize some of our protocols and troubleshoot the problems that we faced while using the plate reader.
