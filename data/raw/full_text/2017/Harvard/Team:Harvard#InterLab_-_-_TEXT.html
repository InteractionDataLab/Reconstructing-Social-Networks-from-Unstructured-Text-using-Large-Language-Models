Overview
Difficulty in taking reliable and reproducible measurements remains a key obstacle in establishing synthetic biology as an engineering discipline. The InterLab Study is part of the Measurement Committee’s continuing effort to develop a standard measurement procedure for green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite being one of the most commonly used markers in synthetic biology, labs often resort to making relative comparisons, which makes it difficult for labs to share and data and/or constructs.
For the fourth installment of the InterLab, iGEM hopes to establish a GFP measurement protocol that can be used to produce comparable GFP measurements on different plate readers. In addition, iGEM teams from around the world have tested RBS devices (BCDs) intended to increase the precision and reliability of gene expression. The parts used include six test devices  ( BBa_J364000 , BBa_J364001 , BBa_J364002 , BBa_J364003 , BBa_J364004 , BBa_J364005 ), as well as a positive ( BBa_I20270 ) and negative ( BBa_R0040 ) control. All parts are located in the pSB1C3 plasmid and carry chloramphenicol resistance.

Methods
Each of the plasmids listed above were located on Plate 7 of the distribution kit and resuspended in 10 uL of dH2O
Each device was transformed into 10 uL of competent cells (see here for the full transformation protocol)
Transformations were spot plated onto an agar plate with chloramphenicol and grown overnight(see here for the full spot plating protocol)
On Day 2, 2 colonies were picked from each plate and inoculated in 10 mL of LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL Falcon tubes covered with foil. These cultures were grown overnight in an incubator at 37ºC and 220 rpm.
On Day 3, 100 uL of each culture was pipetted into a 96 well plate for an OD600 reading, which was then used for the Dilution Calculations in the Excel sheet provided by iGEM
Each culture was diluted to a target OD of 0.02 following the preloading culture and media volumes calculated by the Dilution excel sheet (see OD Readings and Dilutions Calculations in the Results section below) in 12 mL of LB media + chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tubes wrapped in foil
Cultures were placed in incubator at 37ºC and 220 rpm
4 replicates of 100 uL samples were taken from each culture at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation and placed in a 96 well plate for OD and fluorescence measurements using the setup described above
