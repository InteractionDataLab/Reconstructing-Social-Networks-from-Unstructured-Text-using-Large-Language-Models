Collaborations
The spark for our collaboration was the fact that we had an idea for a microfluidic device and the Boston University iGEM team had the expertise to turn that idea into reality. Our initial concept paved the way for the Boston University team to incorporate the role of electronics in microfluidic devices into their narrative.  See the microfluidics page on our wiki for a detailed description of the device.
