Parts
RBS library is composed of varying RBS strengths for different expression levels
The parts feature varying strength RBS in front of csgG, the porous protein involved in the secretion of monomeric csgA in wild-type E. coli. These parts can be stitched together with a standard promoter and compared with other similar parts with different RBSs to see some varying level of csgG expression.

Origin of Sequences
The csgG protein was taken from the wild-type E. coli operon; the specific plasmid was provided by the Joshi lab at the Wyss Institute. The RBS was generated via the Salis Lab RBS generator.
Design
The RBS sequence was generated from a randomized library of RBSs using the Salis Lab RBS generator. Then, plasmids with desired RBS strengths were screened for and selected. Refer to our protocol page for details.
