Protective compounds choices against frost and heat
Overview
Once the different methods of Softer Shock application on the leaf      and the choice of the expression host have been explored, it is now      the time to think of how this latter will perform its protective action      at the plant surface. Our core strategy lies in the thermo-responsiveness      of our micro-organism, providing a dual response against extreme temperatures.      Specific protectants will be synthesized according to meteorological events,      and protect the plan from these eventual abiotic stresses.
What happens at the plant level in case of frost or heat episodes? Which      compounds could prevent those deleterious effects?
During our investigations, we looked through diverse research axis      and summarize here the main compounds that appeared the most promising      for us.
We deeply thank Nicolas Aveline, Camille Lenoir, Christian Huyghe, Guillaume Charrier,   Ido Braslavsky and Maya Bar Dolev for their valuable pieces of advice. Through several interviews,   these experts helped us better understand the complex physiological mechanisms of heat and   frost damage on plants. They also guided our choices concerning our different protective   compound candidates. You can find the complete interviews in written form below:

Cold Protection
Below 0°C, freezing has several negative effects on grapevines as well as other plants. Spring frost episodes are particularly harmful, as the grapevine has already restarted its growth and crucial organs (buds and leaves) under formation can be easily destroyed1. These events are characterized by sudden temperature drops, often happening at night, and can result in severe production losses as well as an alteration of fruit characteristics of the following harvest 2.
The mechanism of ice crystal formation, called nucleation, is one of the main factors causing diverse interlinked types of damage at various scales. Ice crystals growing extracellularly create cell dehydration through the reduction of available liquid water3. When exposed to prolonged freezing temperatures, the formation of larger ice masses through the recrystallization process can mechanically affect plant tissues and internal structures4. Facing these challenges, we tried to find the best strategy to preserve the most vulnerable organs and tissues by producing specific protectants at the plant surface.
Ice-Binding Proteins (IBPs) have the ability to bind ice crystals and operate different actions on them. Among this particular protein family, Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs) encircle crystals to inhibit their growth. Ice-Nucleation Proteins (INPs), on the other hand, act as nucleation cores to promote ice formation5. These apparently contradictory actions rely on similar mechanisms help reducing frost damage in their own way.
Our first strategy is the most intuitive: producing antifreeze proteins at the plant surface to inhibit crystal growth. Part of natural protection mechanisms in wintering plants, these proteins bind ice crystals and limit their expansion 6. Since external and internal ice crystal formation seem to be interrelated7, the prevention of ice crystal formation externally could have a real impact on inhibiting recrystallisation, and lowering the water freezing temperature.
Among the numerous AFP types expressed in Nature, a particular AFP type called   RiAFP, taken from the freezing-avoiding beetle Rhagium inquisitor, seems particularly   suitable for our objective in terms of action and synthesis requirements. When expressed   at 15°C, its high thermal hysteresis activity could significantly reduce the risk of ice   formation and indirectly protect inner tissues 8.
What is also interesting with AFPs is the perspectives offered by protein engineering   and isoform synergistic effect. The latter refers to the fact that different AFP isoforms   operating together give a better antifreeze efficiency than the sum of the same isoforms   taken separately. These two strategies enhance the protein activity, making these   compounds even more interesting 9.
Our second strategy is opposed to the first one, but could be of equally interest.   Producing ice-nucleating proteins at the plant surface to favor ice formation. This is   the basic principle of water aspersion, one of the most commonly techniques used by   wine-growers to protect vines from frost. The mechanism relies on the release of latent   heat from this exothermic reaction as well as the insulating properties of the ice layer   formed 10. Coupled to the aspersion method, ice-nucleating proteins could significantly   optimize the process and allow high water savings.
We are not the first ones to consider modulating ice crystal formation to protect   plants in the context of the IGEM competition. As an example, the project “PlantiFreeze”   of 2014 Weston team consists of the production and secretion of AFP by E.coli. (https://2014hs.igem.org/Team:CSWProteens)
Additionally, in the 1980’s, a product called Frostban was developed by using genetically   modified ice-nucleating bacteria. The goal was to knock-out the Ice-nucleation protein gene   to engineer a replacement for naturally occurring ice-nucleating bacteria that were on the plant   leaves and were responsible for frost damage. The strategy was different from ours because it   relied on massive spraying of GMOs that were supposed to compete with their natural counterpart11.                  While the product was proven to be efficient, numerous GMO related controversies made it   impossible to commercialise. We did a case-study of Frostban in our Wiki here , do not hesitate to go   there if you want more details!
Heat Protection
At high temperatures around 40°C, many crops including grapevines suffer from   protein denaturation, as well as water stress and solar radiation damage. Despite   automatic stomatal closure, water loss by evapotranspiration can cause severe dehydration of tissues 12. In addition to temperature increases, a direct exposure to solar   radiation enhances the number of harmful free radicals inside the cells and can damage   them. Shriveled fruits are a main consequence of solar damage 13. Protecting grapevines   from excess sunlight could significantly help farmers to deal with climate change,   leading to an increase in the frequency of heatwaves and droughts.
Some plants and animals have the property to adapt their albedo, the ability   of a surface to reflect sunlight, according to their environment. The desert plant Encelia farinosa produces leaves covered with white trichomes during the drought season.   This induces a considerable albedo increase and reduces the heat loading of leaves,   limiting water loss and high temperature stress 12.
We hypothesized we may reproduce this albedo augmentation by creating a physical   barrier against solar radiations. This can be achieved by making our microorganism   produce white reflective compounds at the leaf surface. The challenge was to find white   molecules that could be expressed on the plant without compromising its functions or the   existing microbiota.
We tried to find our inspiration in nature, and it turned out that   different compound types take a white coloration. Proteins such as casein,   main protein of milk, are already used for industrial purposes and could be   of interest for this objective14. However, their nutritive nature could   potentially disturb the regular biodiversity15. Biopolymers such as chitin   and its derivatives also own interesting reflecting properties, and appear   neutral for the plant 16. Another interesting approach is the biomineralization:   some bacteria can precipitate mineral ions like calcium carbonate and cover   surfaces with a white layer 17.
Fighting against heat-related crop damages through albedo modification is an area of active research. For example, a product called Invelop composed of talc was developed to reduce exposure to solar radiation and also to fight against certain parasites18. Reflective surfaces are even engineered to cool down rooftops! 19
