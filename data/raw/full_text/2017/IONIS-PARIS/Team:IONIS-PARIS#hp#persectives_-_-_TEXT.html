Perspectives
We will continue doing science education for the iGEM competition. Through our project,             our team has sensitized students on the integration and the acceptance of biotechnologies.
Because promoting molecular biology and synthetic biology is essential, a partnership was formed           between Europabio and our team ! The goal of this alliance  is  to communicate about green biotechnology           in exchange for financial support (click to see the invoice and the collaboration report with Europabio).           It is an honor for us, to continue promoting and sharing an innovative and dynamic environment for the           agricultural biotech and promote the communication about synthetic biology.
We also met the mayor of Paris , Mrs.Hidalgo Anne, to organise events in French schools for children           and universities. We will have to prepare further conferences and activities to encourage society to learn           more about science, research, and biotechnology.  These two future perspectives will encourage the general           population to learn more about synthetic biology and discover all the amazing opportunities that it offers!
