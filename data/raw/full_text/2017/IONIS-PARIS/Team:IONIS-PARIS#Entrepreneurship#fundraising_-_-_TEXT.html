Fundraising and communication
In an entrepreneurship context, we had to collect funds to develop our project and we had to communicate on it in order to gain visibility and to catch people's attention.
The report we made deals with how we collected all             the necessary funds to send 9 people to Boston and pay for the lab experiments.
It might be useful for future iGEM teams willing             to collect a similar amount of money.
We raised around 16 000€ in different ways:
Institutional sponsors: Sup’Biotech and EPITA universities
Volunteering events: Paris half-marathon and marathon,                 Bois de Boulogne 10km, The Vélotour, the Disney runs.

Public funds: The mayor’s office of Sèvres,                     the French Embassy in the USA, the French Research ministry, and Val de Marne county.
Private sponsors: Chamorin company, Les                     Mousquetaires Intermarché, Europa Bio.

Fundraising with Kickstarter:
The Kickstarter was launched on the 28th of August and ends on 27th of October. We managed to               attain our goal, raising 2 607€ and therefore financed at 104%. We thank everybody that helped               us reach our financial goal!

Overview of the Kickstarter Campaign
On social networks we published every week about our work, who           we met (iGEM teams, professionals, winemakers, etc…) and also advertising our Kickstarter page           and our team members. This allowed to share our project and progress to the world.
If you wish to know more about how we managed this amazing quest for funds, do not hesitate to             read our Fundraising and Communication report dealing in details with all these different steps that we have taken.
Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
