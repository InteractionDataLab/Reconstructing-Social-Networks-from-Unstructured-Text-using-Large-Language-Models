This year, as was done the past two years, we have formed a multidisciplinary team made of 20 members from different IONIS schools (EPITA, E-artpup and Sup'Biotech). We have had many adventures working together and we have especially discovered our group skills under rush moments. Our advisors, instructors and followers have guided and helped us when we needed it. We would like to thank our iGEM mentor Mr Selvarajah for his pieces of advice and for helping us understanding the iGEM submissions. The team PARIS IONIS was responsible for most of the iGEM adventure functioning: fundraising, ordering supplies, laboratory experiments, background and applied research, designing the project, finding sponsors and partnerships, organizing events, team organization and project communication among the society. The help of our advisors, instructors and mentors was very appreciated and acknowledged below.

Mrs. Eugénia POMMARET Human Practices
Director at the UIPP (Union pour la protection des plantes). She succeeded to Mr. Bocquet. She explained us how phytosanitary products are regulated in France, what are all the measures the UIPP uses regarding safety and risks for consumers and buyers. She explained us how regulation works for phytosanitary products and she gave us some companies’ contacts that will be more useful to place our product “SofterShock” in a regulatory context. See the interview here .

Dr. Camille PROFIZI, Mr. Ronan KEMPF & Mrs. Christelle GARRIGUES
We warmly thank Mrs. PROFIZI CAMILLE Mr. RONAN KEMPF Mrs.GARRIGUES CHRISTELLE for inviting us to their company Agrauxine at Angers. They listened to our project, they gave us advice about the safety part regarding GMOs and they suggested us to be careful about the leave phyllosphere because it is very complex and it will be difficult for us to choose a specific chassis to work with. They advised us to quantify the dead vines each year due to frosts and compare to the number of surviving vines in order to have a better estimation of what our product can bring. We thank Mr. Kempf for the marketing advice about how to position our solution Softer Shock in the market and Mrs Garrigues for her clear opinion about Softer Shock “very clear strategic side, but we must work hardly on the environmental GMOs’ controversy".

Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
This year we are 20 members from different schools:18 students from Sup’Biotech1 student from e-artsup1 student from Epita Read more …
