  Working with the plant: chassis selection in accordance with the phyllosphere
</H1><DIV class="igem-container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="colored-container"><P><B>Overview</B>:</P><P>
              The <B>plant aerial surface</B>, of which the leaves cover most, is home to many <B>microorganisms</B> (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes).
              This <B>microbiota</B> of the plant surface is called the <B>phyllosphere</B>, and it is truly fascinating because of its unique
              characteristics<SUP>1</SUP>. The leaves are harsh environments for life and these organisms show interesting <B>adaptive
              properties</B>. They are also able to interact closely to the host plant, forming what is called a <B>holobiont</B>.
            </P></DIV><FIGURE class="centered"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1: the plant aerial surface, mostly occupied by leaves, is inhabited by diverse microorganisms, forming the phyllosphere</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
          Learning about the phyllosphere was important for us because we wanted to know how our organism would survive on
          the surface of the leaf. We want to <B>predict</B> how our organism will interact with the leaf microbiota. Indeed, just like
          any other microbiota, the phyllosphere has a <B>fragile balance</B> and perturbing it with our organisms is the last
          thing we want. While we were studying the phyllosphere, we had the pleasure of an interview with a phyllosphere
          expert,  <B>Dr. Corinne Vacher</B> (you can find the interview
          <U><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/b/b6/Ionis-paris-2017-HP-achievements-Vacher.pdf">here)</A></U>, who gave
          us a lot of information and advice.
        </P><P>
          It is important to understand as much as we can about the environment we are going to work on to <B>synergise</B> with it
          and maximise product efficiency.
        </P><P>
          The phyllosphere can be a <B>harsh environment</B>, particularly with respect to <B>temperature</B> and <B>solar radiation</B>. Such a
          microclimate is <B>highly heterogeneous</B> and makes our product difficult to engineer and model without field study<SUP>2</SUP></P><FIGURE class="centered"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 2: Many variables from both internal and external climates of the leaf influence the phyllosphere microbial community and potentially Softer Shock</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><P>
              We have also analysed the <B>microbial phylums</B> of the phyllosphere (bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea), showing a
              great variety of adaptative properties like methanol metabolism and UV stress resistance. Surviving in the environment
              of the leaf is difficult and requires some unique strategies, hence the microbial population is not homogeneously
              located on the leaves but rather on <B>nutrient oases</B><SUP>1,3</SUP>.
              Most available <B>nutrients</B> of the phyllosphere are leached <B>by-products</B> of <B>plant metabolism</B> such as carbohydrates and
              methanol, so the <B>Phyllosphere Microbial Community</B> (PMC) could almost be compared to scavengers that live with the
              strict minimum<SUP>1</SUP>.
              The phyllosphere organisms can provide stimulation through <B>hormone secretion</B> (like auxin), and protect the host
              from pathogens by forming a <B>physical barrier</B>, just like our gut microbiota<SUP>3</SUP>.
            </P><P>
              The <B>population dynamics</B> of phyllosphere organisms, as well as how they interact with their host, is important to assess.
              These microbial populations are influenced by many parameters and interact with each other in the classical schemes
              of predation, commensalism, parasitism, mutualism and ammensalism. We also examined the <B>routes of colonisation</B> of the
              aerial parts of the plant by its microbiota at the origin (rainfall, soil…)<SUP>3</SUP>.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><P>
              For <B>Softer Shock</B> we need a <B>host organism</B>, or chassis for our plasmid. Our strategy is to select as a chassis an organism that
              lives in the <B>target’s phyllosphere</B>.
              The characteristics of the phyllosphere are very important because they could enhance the properties and effects of our
              product on the targeted plant if we choose a chassis that comes from the target’s microbiota. By selecting a microorganism
              native to the target crop’s phyllosphere we will better be able to <B>predict its behavior</B> and know that it can survive
              in hard conditions, and provide <B>additional beneficial services</B> for our product.
            </P><P>
              We believe that our <B>chassis selection</B> could be made with <B>metagenomics</B>, the science of genome analysis, that permits
              to know what organisms are in a given environmental sample and what are their functions. For example, we could <B>sample</B>
              leaves from a <B>vineyard</B>, then analyse the <B>genome</B> of its microbial inhabitants and try to assess their functions, relying
              as well on proteomics, metabolomics and many other interesting sciences<SUP>4</SUP>.
              The analysis will permit us to <B>select the most interesting organism</B> for any vineyard and maximise <B>efficiency and
              biosafety</B>. We hypothesise indeed that by selecting a <B>phyllosphere specific organism</B>, we will reduce its impact on
              other environment such as soil and water, because it will not be adapted to them. We hence will need to analyse the
              target plant's surrounding environment to choose an organism that is <B>specific</B> only to its phyllosphere.
            </P></DIV></DIV><FIGURE class="centered"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 3: Our chassis selection strategy relies on metagenomics and the identification of the ideal candidate according to the target’s phyllosphere and environment.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
          With such science, and as the phyllosphere varies with <B>plant species</B> and <B>geographic localisation</B>, we want to prove that we could use <B>personalized treatment</B> for each farmer by selecting a <B>specific chassis</B> for each. That way we will adapt to the farmer rather than he adapts to us. In a time of controversies raised by monopolisation of seed market by big companies, such strategy could help raise confidence from the farmers to GMOs and synthetic biology.

Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
