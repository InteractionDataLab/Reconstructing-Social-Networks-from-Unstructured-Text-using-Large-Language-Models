Working with the plant: chassis selection in accordance with the phyllosphere
Overview:
The plant aerial surface, of which the leaves cover most, is home to many microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes).               This microbiota of the plant surface is called the phyllosphere, and it is truly fascinating because of its unique               characteristics1. The leaves are harsh environments for life and these organisms show interesting adaptive               properties. They are also able to interact closely to the host plant, forming what is called a holobiont.
Figure 1: the plant aerial surface, mostly occupied by leaves, is inhabited by diverse microorganisms, forming the phyllosphere
Learning about the phyllosphere was important for us because we wanted to know how our organism would survive on           the surface of the leaf. We want to predict how our organism will interact with the leaf microbiota. Indeed, just like           any other microbiota, the phyllosphere has a fragile balance and perturbing it with our organisms is the last           thing we want. While we were studying the phyllosphere, we had the pleasure of an interview with a phyllosphere           expert, Dr. Corinne Vacher (you can find the interview here) , who gave           us a lot of information and advice.
It is important to understand as much as we can about the environment we are going to work on to synergise with it           and maximise product efficiency.
The phyllosphere can be a harsh environment, particularly with respect to temperature and solar radiation. Such a           microclimate is highly heterogeneous and makes our product difficult to engineer and model without field study2
Figure 2: Many variables from both internal and external climates of the leaf influence the phyllosphere microbial community and potentially Softer Shock
We have also analysed the microbial phylums of the phyllosphere (bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea), showing a               great variety of adaptative properties like methanol metabolism and UV stress resistance. Surviving in the environment               of the leaf is difficult and requires some unique strategies, hence the microbial population is not homogeneously               located on the leaves but rather on nutrient oases1,3.               Most available nutrients of the phyllosphere are leached by-products of plant metabolism such as carbohydrates and               methanol, so the Phyllosphere Microbial Community (PMC) could almost be compared to scavengers that live with the               strict minimum1.               The phyllosphere organisms can provide stimulation through hormone secretion (like auxin), and protect the host               from pathogens by forming a physical barrier, just like our gut microbiota3.
The population dynamics of phyllosphere organisms, as well as how they interact with their host, is important to assess.               These microbial populations are influenced by many parameters and interact with each other in the classical schemes               of predation, commensalism, parasitism, mutualism and ammensalism. We also examined the routes of colonisation of the               aerial parts of the plant by its microbiota at the origin (rainfall, soil…)3.
For Softer Shock we need a host organism, or chassis for our plasmid. Our strategy is to select as a chassis an organism that               lives in the target’s phyllosphere.               The characteristics of the phyllosphere are very important because they could enhance the properties and effects of our               product on the targeted plant if we choose a chassis that comes from the target’s microbiota. By selecting a microorganism               native to the target crop’s phyllosphere we will better be able to predict its behavior and know that it can survive               in hard conditions, and provide additional beneficial services for our product.
We believe that our chassis selection could be made with metagenomics, the science of genome analysis, that permits               to know what organisms are in a given environmental sample and what are their functions. For example, we could sample leaves from a vineyard, then analyse the genome of its microbial inhabitants and try to assess their functions, relying               as well on proteomics, metabolomics and many other interesting sciences4. The analysis will permit us to select the most interesting organism for any vineyard and maximise efficiency and               biosafety. We hypothesise indeed that by selecting a phyllosphere specific organism, we will reduce its impact on               other environment such as soil and water, because it will not be adapted to them. We hence will need to analyse the               target plant's surrounding environment to choose an organism that is specific only to its phyllosphere.
Figure 3: Our chassis selection strategy relies on metagenomics and the identification of the ideal candidate according to the target’s phyllosphere and environment.
With such science, and as the phyllosphere varies with plant species and geographic localisation, we want to prove that we could use personalized treatment for each farmer by selecting a specific chassis for each. That way we will adapt to the farmer rather than he adapts to us. In a time of controversies raised by monopolisation of seed market by big companies, such strategy could help raise confidence from the farmers to GMOs and synthetic biology.

Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
This year we are 20 members from different schools:18 students from Sup’Biotech1 student from e-artsup1 student from Epita Read more …
