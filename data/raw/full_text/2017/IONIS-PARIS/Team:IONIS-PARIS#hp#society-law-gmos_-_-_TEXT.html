Public Opinion
The objectives of the survey
These surveys will provide information to complement our Interactive Map. It will help to understand                 how GMOs are perceived by the general public, but also how people are                 informed and whether they feel concerned about the development of GMOs.
The intended audience
Concerning the survey, the target audience is the general population in order to have                 a generalized perception of GMOs.
Translation work
We translated our survey into 9 languages to allow a maximum people to                 answer it. We made versions in: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,                 Chinese, Japanese, German, Korean and Arabic. This was feasible thanks to                 our relatives and friends help but also a great investment of our team members.
Distribution of the survey
The distribution of the survey was done through iGEM teams. They first had to complete the                 survey before sending it to their families and friends. Thanks to their help, we succeed to gather more than 100 answers for                 France and Brazil and around 80 answers for Mexico.
The type of information to produce
The opinion of GMOs according to country, age or gender
The perception of our product
The relevance of our Interactive Map.
The conditions of satisfaction
We are looking for information  to answer the major problems found by the                 already existing websites on GMOs. We want to make our platform active and                 attractive for young, researchers and curious people.                 Our goal will be reached when our platform will inform about: An adequate                 definition of GMOs, news about GMOs (the advances in each sector for each                 country) , a  popularized regulation of GMO and a representative opinions.
Consequently, a target of 100 answers is expected per country for each                 survey to enable us to build our online platform.
The statistical analysis
As said above, we selected the surveys with around 100 answers. Also, 12                 out of the 23 questions were analysed to get the population opinion, to make                 hypothesis whether or not our project could be implemented in the country and                 to know if our interactive map was a special need to get more information about                 GMOs. Here are below the conclusions of the 3 surveys we analysed: France,                 Brazil and Mexico.
With no surprise, we found out that our “Softer Shock” product might struggle to find its place in France.
Several results support this conclusion: firstly, 78% of the population think             GMOs are not safe for the environment. Secondly, 144 out of 219 people (65.75%) were             concerned by the eventual presence of GMOs in agriculture or environment.             And finally, 44% of persons against the use of GMOs on crops to protect them             from harsh temperatures.
However, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s             requirements. It meets the needs of 65% people that wish to develop their knowledge             about GMOs.

In opposition with France, “Softer Shock” might succeed to find its place in Brazil.
Several results support this conclusion: Firstly, 38% of the population think that GMOs             are safe for the environment; Secondly, 49 out of 102 people (48%) are supporting the             development and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment.             And finally, the 75% of persons for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh             temperatures.
Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements.             It meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs.

To balance the previous results, Mexico is more moderated regarding population opinion.             Several results support this conclusion: Firstly, 50% of the population think that GMOs are             not safe for the environment; Secondly, 45 out of 80 people (56%) are supporting the development             and use of GMOs in agriculture or environment.             And finally, the 84% of persons voting for the use of GMOs on crops to protect them from harsh             temperatures.
Moreover, our interactive map project is in accordance with the population’s requirements. It             meets the needs of 90% people that wish to develop their knowledge about GMOs.

These 3 analysis give us a precise vision of the public opinion in the concerned countries.             Regarding our interactive map, the objective was to work on different fields for 6 countries             (USA, Taïwan, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil). However, the lack of answers for 3 of them             do not allow us to show representative results.             From the public opinion follows the creation of laws and regulation of the country.
If you want to know more about the regulations put in place by different governments, do not             hesitate to read our “Law and regulation” part in clicking here.
GMO's Regulation
Objectives
The objective of the data collection for the global regulation of GMO is to           complete our interactive map. Also, we want to compare how GMOs are perceived by           the government in different countries around the word and how they put into effect the regulation.
Intended audience
The public for the regulation of our project are mainly the population that want           to discover easily the GMOs’ regulation of their country or in another one. This part           can be useful to the future IGEM teams or for scientific researchers too, to see all           the regulatory requirements to start a project in a country.
Data collect
To collect data for all countries, we consult:
International Organism website (Food and Agriculture Organization of the             United Nation, International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, …)
National Organism website (United State Department of Agriculture,               the Library of Congress, …)
National government website
the Law of the country
We asked IGEM team in the country for more information
The Regulation
Here are below the data collected about GMO's regulation from 6 countries: Brazil,               China, France, Mexico, Spain, United States.
Brazil
Brazil is an open-minded country about the development of GMOs, despite                     a strict law to limit the spreading of GMOs in the environment Brazil is one                     of the major producer and exporter of GMO crops. Although, consumption of                     genetically modified crops is legal the product need to be labeled as transgenic.1 Besides, to protect the environment of the propagation of GMO, Brazil ratified the Cartagena                   Protocol on Biosafety.2 An international protocol of good conduct to protect                   the environment.3
China
This past years, China have enacted many laws on GMOs to boost their research                   on biotechnology without neglect the environment and the human health. In this                   optic, research on GMOs are facilitate but the cultivation and the commercialization                   are strictly supervised. The consumption of modified crops is possible, but the                   product has to present a label .4, 5 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by China.2
France
France has a really strict law on GMO, in addition to the European law,                 France enacts other laws to restrict their utilization. Due to the unfavorable                 opinion public opinion on the subject, there is no GMO cultivation in France                 except for some scientific research and the consumption of transgenic product                 is practically inexistent despite a flexible law on the subject.6, 7 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by France.2
Mexico
Mexico’s Law on GMO, privilege the right use of safety during the manipulation of it.               Many reports are required on the identification, the evaluations and the strategies               planned to counter the spreads of GMO in the environment. Despite this safety, Mexico               produce many type of GMOs and the law for the consumption of modified crops specify that a               transgenic product did not require a specific label unless special condition.8, 9 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by Mexico.2
Spain
Unlike France, Spain is an open-minded European country about GMOs. It is the             biggest producer of GMO crops in Europe. Like France, Spain must follow the European law             on GMO, but the country also enacts their own law for the research and production of GMO.             In the other hand, for their consumption, Spain only follow the European recommendation.10, 11 The Cartagena protocol was also ratified by Spain. 2
United State
The United States are the biggest producer of GMO thanks to a different           point of view from the society, government and economy of the country. In the           United States most GMOs are considered as safe for the human health. This point           of view facilitates companies and individuals to produce and consume GMO than in           other countries. Indeed, GMOs are considered as a food additive by the US law and           not as a biologic product.4, 12 In this optic, the United States did not ratify the Cartagena Protocol         on Biosafety to protect the environment of the propagation of GMO.2
During this data collect, we saw different point of view on GMOs. We only focus     on 6 countries, but we want to continue filling out the interactive map to have a     global overview of the different regulation in the world. Afterward, we were curious     about different applications of synthetic biology on these countries and how companies     and scientific researchers adapt their work to their country regulation.

Interactive map
Objectives
We wanted to understand how society perceive GMOs in the world and where our project Softer Shock will be more suitable to be develop. Our goal is to share and communicate a maximum of information to know how GMOs work around the world in an attractive, objective and funny way. The map was designed with the help of iGEM teams through surveys (go to “Dialogue and Education” to see the survey analysis) to respond to society’s need for information and to be open source to everyone (researchers, entrepreneurs, iGEM teams, and the general public).
The first step to creating these surveys was to identify the key issues through a review of current sources of information on GMOs addressed to the general public. The second step was to translate the survey into several languages with the help of friends and family and distribute it around the world.
Several iGEM teams helped us to distribute the surveys in their country. Thanks to them we collected answers from all over the world and got more than 100 responses from key countries such as Mexico, France, Spain, and Brazil. We used these four countries to gauge the major needs of a society with respect to GMOs and develop a general approach for other countries.
The results also reflect the historical and current-events context in health, environment, and agriculture sectors, as well as reactions of regulations and safety directives in place in these countries.
We reviewed the GMO safety and application regulations in 6 countries: Spain, France, Mexico, Brazil, China, and USA. We didn’t analyse the surveys for China, USA, and Spain because there were not enough answers. We also reviewed the current state of GMO deployment in these countries.
How was the interactive map coded?
A few words from our computer engineer
The online interactive map collects and displays the results of our international GMO survey about. The website was made with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, while the map itself is displayed using D3.js.
The smooth slide scrolling effects were achieved using the One Page Scroll library, and all animations are pure CSS.

Working on these countries allowed us to be in a direct contact with their iGEM teams. Some of these countries also encountered problems from climate change that affects vineyards in Mexico, Spain and Greece (which is not yet represented on the map).
They spoke with us by Skype and distributed our survey among the winemakers in order to understand how they deal with climate change and introduce Softer Shock as a potential solution. Most of them gave advice for French vineyards on which techniques should be used. To find out more go to “Dialogue with Experts”.
Dialogue with experts
Integration of Softer Shock in the world of industry
Our team needed a deeper understanding of how our project can be developed industrially. We interviewed experts in plant protection, law, and economics to understand the effect that softer shock would have in the business world. For each meeting we add the link of the full transcript which you can read below each paragraph.
1- Discussion about the interactive map with Mr Tarnowski - Swiper CEO - 07/26/2017
We met Mr Tarnovsky, CEO of Swiper. As he has valuable knowledge about websites and data, we organized a meeting during the summer.
The idea of the interactive map was discussed and what we needed to do so it becomes a valuable tool that can help a lot of people. The aspects highlighted were the importance and the ways to get data. It was advised to build a prototype of the map so we could assess the behaviour of the user. it was suggested that the prototype must contain a limited amount of countries such as the one belonging to the G20 group.Datas must be collected from the prototype so that the project can answer to the visitor’s need. In order to get those datas, the prototype would display a restricted amount of information and the website would be fully accessible only when the survey is filled. This ensure the degree of data filling. Other ways include offering visibility and advertising from partners.

2- Regulation and laws conversation with the Haut Conseils des Biotechnologies (HCB) - 09/26/2017
We met Mr Pujol and Mr Rémondet: “Scientific officers” at HBC to enlighten us on all questions concerning GMOs. The HCB is responsible for informing the public decision. It advises us on all matters of biotechnology, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
During this interview, we presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get advice to improve our presentation. We particularly discussed about some techniques to do “GMOs” accepted by the laws by using New Plants Breeding Techniques. They also help us to place our project in a GMO category for the society security.
To finish, they encourage us to continue to be engage with farmers and consumers  because they will helps us to integrate SofterShock in the society.

3- Discussion with Mrs Françoise Roure economist in the biotechnology field - 05/17/2017
Mrs Roure is an economist, chair of the Committee "Safety, Security and Risks" and Ministry of Economy in France. The goal of this meeting was to discussed about  the place of synthetic biology in the current economy context.
Our interview with Mrs. Roure was at the beginning of our iGEM adventure! She helped us build our human practices and advised us to address certain point such as the toxicological study or the sustainable soil development. We also discussed a long time about the killswitch system and she gives us some idea to develop one.
Mrs Roure has been very helpful for this aspect of the competition. She found us many contacts in order to have the the best expertise for our project.

4- Plant protection conversation at UIPP with Mrs  Eugénia Pommaret - 09/12/2017
The goal of this meeting was to talk about the plant protection and specifically on the regulation and the communication around the agricultural world. This company called IUPP worked on the development of good practices for farmers. Eugénia Pommaret the executive director of UIPP (union of industry for the protection of the plant)  met us in order to help us in the elaboration of our project softer shock.
She advised us to look at the European regulations because it will define what our biological solution is. Currently, winegrowers are using pheromones produced by genetically modified bacteria. This technique is completely allowed in France and we can try to follow this example in order to place our biological solution on the French market.

5- Plant protection conversation with Mr Bocquet Director of the European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) - 07/12/2017
The goal of this meeting was to talk about the plant protection with Mr Bocquet former director of the European Crop Protection Association. He helped us to enhance our presentation and gives us pieces of advice such as emphasizing the cold shock part as a marketing priority (for vineyards, specifically).
Mr Bocquet has been very helpful for the human practices part of the iGEM competition. He provide us contacts in order to have the best expertise for our project.

6- Climate change conversation with Mr Pauthier working as terroir Project Manager at Comité champagne - 07/01/2017
The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France. We discussed about the dangers of cold temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost with the help of particular devices.
This year, the frost during the spring resulted in a loss of 70% of the grapevines in the region of Bordeaux and a loss of 25% in Champagne. Several techniques to counter these losses are used by professionals in this sector. However it is often expensive and water consuming.
At the end of the meeting, Mr Pauthier offers to us the possibility to do some experimentation in their institution. If the proof of concept is successful, a partnership will be done between the iGEM Paris Ionis team and the Comité Champagne in order to perform some tests in the field.

7- Climate change conversation with Mrs Sylviane Leplatre engineer in agronomy and oenologist giving advice to the winemakers in the region of Paris - 08/17/17
The goal of this interview was to understand the main climate changes affecting the vineyard in France and more specifically the south of  France affected by very hot summer. We discussed about the dangers of cold and hot temperature and also how winemakers can reduce the impact of frost and heat with the help of particular devices.
Mrs Leplatre think that our project is a good idea because global warming affecting the vineyards are the problem of the year. It was the first time that the south of the France has suffered from frost. There has been 10 % to 15% less production this year because of hail, frost or drought.
As long as your product has no impact on health, she sees no inconvenience in advising the vine growers to use this solution on their vineyards. She also give us some advice on our product. If our solution are working on the vine it will be necessary to irrigate the vineyard in addition because the soil will be dry too and it will be not enough to have only our solution.

8- Plant care discussion with  Agrauxine - 09/05/2017
The 5th of September we were invited by Agrauxine the business unit of the group LESAFRE PLANT CARE. They are specialise in the development of products from microorganisms for crop protection.
We had the opportunity to met with Mrs. PROFIZI CAMILLE (R&D director), Mr. RONAN KEMPF (Marketing and Development director) and Mrs.GARRIGUES CHRISTELLE (R&D representative from Lesaffre in Angers).
We presented our project to our interlocutors to know their point of view and to get pieces of advice to improve our presentation.
They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project to others companies in the same field, what we should delve deeper such as the safety and applied design part about our project and what we should conceal  or place in the middle of the presentation to avoid troubles especially in France such as the term GMO and direct contact with the environment. Unfortunately they weren’t able to finance the project due to the company image in France but in exchange they put us in contact with several experts in the French Agriculture regulation like the ANSES and the contact of someone in the United States GMO regulation.
It was a very pleasant experience, to talk to professionals in the plant care, have their opinion about SofterShock and share scientific knowledge. We certainly developed our professional communication skills!

9- Plant protection conversation with Syngenta - 10/02/2017
The 10th of october, we were invited by Syngenta a biotechnology company that conducts genomic research. We met Mrs Lebas Marie-Cecile (Public Affairs Director) Mr Thevenot Xavier (Strategic Cooperation Director)  and Michel Petit (R&D Head).
The goal of this interview was to talk about our project in order to improve it.They were very interested in our project and gave us some tips, to present the project at the Giant jamboree in November. They help us to understand which part of our presentation needed to be clearly explain such as the R&D and safety part. We also re-think about the real interest for farmers to have a thermo-sensitive and autonomous system.
For future perspectives, we talked in a second part about how we can limit the regulation problems by transforming an organism and then induce a horizontal gene transfer to our chassis (directed mutagenesis).

Dialogue with winemakers
Integration of Softer Shock in the world of viticulture
This year, we wanted to be as close as possible of our customers the winemakers. This goal has been achieved ! We met winegrowers from France and  all over the world such as  Spain, Greece and Mexico that deals with climate disorders. The 13th of october we met the winemakers through an events called Pari Fermier at Paris. We had the possibility to discuss with 4 winemakers located in different places. We wanted to go further, have more information concerning the impact of climate changes in other countries.  We sent a survey to other iGEM teams as a collaboration and they spread it to winemakers in their area. If you want to have more details about a region just click on the maps and you will have all information concerning the climate changes, the techniques use but also their opinion on our project Softer Shock !
Champagne - Hubert Thiebault - Montgenost - France
Temperature changes
In Champagne, there are 35,000 hectares and at least 1/3 are affected by climate change. We have warmer winters. Currently, the vegetative state has decreased by 10 days.
Some data
2003: 95% of vines lost due to spring frosts
2016: 30% of vines lost due to spring frosts
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost: No technique used because it is too expensive and requires a large amount of water.However, they have a reserve system. They produce every year a surplus which is used for the next year in case of insufficient harvest because of drastic climate changes.
Drought: There are no  used techniques. Irrigation is forbidden in champagne vineyards because of AOC / AOP appellations.
Impact on the wine quality
The high temperatures will create a situation of water stress and the leaves will not support (burn). There will be a smaller amount of juice and the quality of the wine will decreases considerably.
Support the use of GMOs to mitigate  the impact of climate changes
Yes but before our solution must demonstrate any impact on the health and the environment.
Opinion and advices about our project
Nowaday, there is a communication problem regarding GMOs. Winegrowers are suspicious of technologies because they are afraid that scientists are hiding their data concerning the negative impacts of GMOs in health or for the environment. Our project is suitable for its expectations however it must be accepted by the specifications of champagnes.
Domaine Les Luquettes - Ludovic Lafoucarde - La cadiere d’azur - France
Temperature changes
In Provence, the weather was warmer early in the year. This resulted in a weak flowering and therefore a poor harvest this year. Harvests were made earlier this year ( end of july/ august).
Some data
2017: 10% of vines lost due to spring frosts in his vineyard
2017: 60% vines lost due to spring frosts in average in the region of Provence
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Drought:
There are no  used techniques. Irrigation is forbidden in this region because water is a rare resource.
Frost:
No problems encountered.
Opinion and advices about our project
Mr Lafoucade found our project interesting but he gave us some advices concerning the possibility of changing the microbiota by added a new microorganism. If our solution will change the microbiota of the plants then it will not be interesting for the wine producer because it will change the specificity of the wine.
Domaine de Burgué - Séré - Jeannot Sere - Saint Faust - France
Temperature changes
In the Atlantic Pyrenees, there was no frost damage. This is due in particular to the adaptation of the vines to the climate. Indeed, the vines in this region have undergone few selection and are autochthonous. However, they had this year some sun damage on their fruits.
Some data
2050: Approximatly 40% less rain
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost:
They are using ancestral techniques. They grow the leaves high enough in order to avoid the frost damage.
Drought:
No problems encountered.
Opinion and advices about our project
There is more and more extreme climate change in France. Some region suffer from freezing for several years already. Our project is a good initiative for the coming years.
Domaine des Giraudières - Vins d’Anjou - Roullet Guillaume - Vauchrétien
Temperature changes
In the region of Loiret, there was issues concerning the water stress. An this year, the harvest was earlier, 2 to 3 weeks before the expected date.
Some data
2017: 30 to 40% vines lost due to spring frosts in average in the region of Loiret
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost:
To fight frost they are using wind turbines that allow to brew the air.
Drought:
No problems encountered.
Opinion and advices about our project
The climate change is becoming more impacting than before. Moreover, drought cause also wood diseases and there are no treatments to avoid these lost currently. Consequently, I think that your project is welcome right now and for the future years.
Château Dudon - Sauternes - Michel et Evelyne Allien - BARSAC
Temperature changes
For several years, the Languedoc region has been suffering from water stress. and frost. However, it is too expensive for small vineyards to use techniques to figths this drastic climate changes.
Some data
2017: 80% of vines lost due to spring frosts in the region of Gironde
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost & Drought:
This vineyard is labelling organic so they  have limited means to protect themselves against frost or drought.
Opinion and advices about our project
This winegrower does not feel concerned about our product. Especially because he is labeled organic.
Domaine Brana - St Jean Pied de Port - France
Temperature changes
In Nouvelle Aquitaine, the weather is warmer since 10 years. Consequently, they harvested in average 10 days before the old date. There is an impact on the sugar concentration, the wine will be stronger in alcohol concentration.
Some data
1995: vines lost due to drought in the region of Nouvelle Aquitaine
1991,1996 and 2017: vines lost due to spring frosts in the region of Nouvelle Aquitaine
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost & Drought:
This vineyard is labelling HVE (agroecological) so they  have limited means to protect themselves against frost or drought.
Opinion and advices about our project
This winegrower will support the use of GMOs to mitigate the impact of climate changes but also some diseases affecting the vineyard. He find our idea awesome but we need to try our tests with caution.
Domaine Gutizia - St Etienne de Baigorry - France
Temperature changes
This winegrower is in this region since recently. It is difficult to determine if there is a temperature change for the moment. However, there is a huge lack of water during summer.
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Frost & Drought:
He use clay to fight drought. It form a white layer on the leaves to decrease the dehydration.<
Opinion and advices about our project
This winegrower will support the use of GMOs  if the biological solution will be authorized and with no danger.
Winemakers perception of climate changes on vines in Greece
Temperature changes
Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, 3 saw a drastic climate change this last years. Just below,  are the types of changes they may have noticed:
Winemaker 1 :“A bit warmer summers as well as calmer winters”.
Winemaker 2 :“Bigger drops of temperatures during the winter while severe drought in the summer”.
Winemaker 3 :“Greater heat and more rain in summer”.
Winemaker 4 :“There was a mild raise in summer temperatures, but the winter has become more fierce at certain days, while really mild in the rest”.
Some data
All the winemakers interviewed lost vines recently due to severe frost or severe drought.
Winemaker 1 :“20% of vines lost due to climate changes this year”.
Winemaker 2 :“5% of vines lost due to climate changes this year”.
Winemaker 3 :“5-7 % of vines lost due to climate changes this year”.
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
They all  use special techniques to overcome the cold or drought.                     Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, 3 are not agree supporting the use of genetically modified vines to mitigate the impact of climate change.
Winemaker 1 :“Uncertain of how they will change the final product”.
Winemaker 2 :“Prefer to work with the local cultivars”.
Winemaker 3 :“As an old person, it is quite difficult to adapt to new technologies”.
For the question “Would you be willing to use Softershock on your vines to mitigate the impact of climate change?”
3 of the winemakers answered negatively,  for the following reasons:
Winemaker 1 :“It is not quite tested yet. Upon further testing I might be willing to use”.
Winemaker 2 :“Too new and untested. I wouldn't want to meddle with bioengineered systems, they have a bad history and are a pretense for monopolies”.
Winemaker 3 :“As an old person, it is quite difficult to adapt to new technologies”.
Opinion and advices about our project
Winemaker 1 :“Quite useful as thermal changes in the environment are being more drastic lately. However, I think it's a bit insufficient and not quite sure how it would over a wide area of vines. Keep on trying! Seems like a great idea!”.
Winemaker 2 :“We try to use the traditional cultivation methods only, because we are a household vineyard. We are not interested in employing industrial methods”.
Winemaker 3 :“Probably younger generations could use it, given that it will be safe to use and has the provided results. New technology will probably be needed in the future, given the climate change”.

Mrs Consuelo Melendez perception of climate changes on vines in the region of Chihuahua in Mexico
We met through Skype Mrs Consuelo Mendez winegrower in Mexico with the help of the Chihuahua iGEM team to discuss about  climate changes on vines.
Temperature changes
In Chihuahua, located in the North of Mexico the land is very arid due to it very elevated temperatures, so it remains a deserted place.They have more problems dealing with high temperatures than cold temperatures. They can reach temperatures over 40 ºC in summer and -7ºC in winter.
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Spray some sulfur in powder before cold temperatures arrive.
Diffuse some atomise algae, the product name is “DIATOMIX”, these algae will absorb the soil humidity and avoid water accumulation in the soil.
They irrigate from February to July to avoid frosts and dehydrations, the problem is that they lack sometimes from water and each year they have to do bigger holes to extract water from the subsoil. They have installed an irrigation system placed 60 cm from the soil that will irrigate water only in the trunk of the wine an the soil.
They are some winemakers that produce wine over 2400 m of altitudes of the sea, in that case they use big turbines that generate heat air to avoid frost in winter.
Opinion and advices about our project
In conclusion, Consuelo Melendez found the project SofterShock very interesting and she will be glad and interested to test it, specially to reduce the amount of water used.In conclusion, Consuelo Melendez found the project SofterShock very interesting and she will be glad and interested to test it, specially to reduce the amount of water used.
“Everything comes from the land and we have to be open minded to accept new technologies that will increase and performed the wine production”- Consuelo Melendez

Winemakers perception of climate changes on vines in the region of Valencia and Utiel in Spain
The team UPV Valencia
They send our survey to 4 winemakers, 3 from Utiel - Requena (Spain) and 1 from La Rioja (Spain) one of the most important wine regions in Spain (José Ángel llorente adán. 2011. El viñedo en la Rioja Alta (España) y su localización a partir de factores topo-geomorfológicos.)                             Here are below the conclusions of the survey we analysed:
Temperature changes
Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, all saw a drastic climate change this last years. Just below,  are the types of changes they have noticed:
Winemaker 1 and 2:“We have seen the impacts of temperatures in the rapid coagulation of vines”.
Winemaker 3 :“There has been a drastic change in temperatures, with significant increases and decreases during different periods of the year. The biggest change has been in the carry-over from all stations, since it seems that seasons have moved on dates and are unpredictable for us”.
Winemaker 4 :“There was a mild raise in summer temperatures, but the winter has become more fierce at certain days, while really mild in the rest”.
In conclusion, in those regions, there is a big impact linked to the climate changements from one season to another that causes each year most of the vines damages.
Some data
The 4 winemakers interviewed claim of losing vines recently due to severe frost or severe drought.                                 One of the UPV_iGEM team affirms that in Utiel-Requena wine fields are absolutely more affected by frost in winter.                                 “La Rioja’s winter are very severe with temperatures under -10°C more or less”- UPV_iGEM team 2017.
Winemaker 1 and 2:“10% to 15% of vines lost due to climate changes in the worst cases”.
Winemaker 3 :“Around 40% of vines lost due to climate changes”.
Winemaker 4 :“He don’t know, with accuracy”.
In conclusion these percentages show a serious problem due to extreme temperatures in the vineyard survival.
Techniques to overcome frost or drought
Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, 3 use specific techniques to fight against severe frost or severe drought and only one doesn’t use any technique.
Winemaker 1 and 2:“Electric heaters, eventually”.
Winemaker 3 :“Prune vines late or early, remove grapes”.
As we can see, most of this techniques are costly and no powerful enough for next years.
Support the use of GMOs to mitigate the impact of climate changes
This question was interesting because, it help us to position SofterShock in their society.                                       In an interesting way, only 1 of 4 winemakers was against using genetically modified vineyards to fight climate disorders because they are not well looked upon by society and legally their cultivation is not possible.                                       But, all of the 4 winemakers are agreed to use SofterShock on their vines to fight against climate disorders.
Opinion about our project
Only 3 of them gave their opinion about SofterShock:
Winemaker 1 and 2:“Is an interesting project for the wine industry”.
Winemaker 3 :“It has many possibilities but it is a little far from reality”.
The majority of the winemakers think that SofterShock is safe for vineyards.
