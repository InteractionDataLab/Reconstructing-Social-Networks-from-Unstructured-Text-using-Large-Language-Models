The map was designed with the help of iGEM teams through surveys (go to “Dialogue and Education” to see the survey analysis) to respond to society’s need for information and to be open source to everyone (researchers, entrepreneurs, iGEM teams, and the general public).
                        </P><P>The first step to creating these surveys was to identify the key issues through a review of current sources of information on GMOs addressed to the general public. The second step was to translate the survey into several languages with the help of friends and family and distribute it around the world.
                        </P><P>Several iGEM teams helped us to distribute the surveys in their country. Thanks to them we collected answers from all over the world and got more than 100 responses from key countries such as Mexico, France, Spain, and Brazil. We used these four countries to gauge the major needs of a society with respect to GMOs and develop a general approach for other countries.
                        </P><P> The results also reflect the historical and current-events context in health, environment, and agriculture sectors, as well as reactions of regulations and safety directives in place in these countries.
                        </P><P>We reviewed the GMO safety and application regulations in 6 countries: Spain, France, Mexico, Brazil, China, and USA. We didn’t analyse the surveys for China, USA, and Spain because there were not enough answers. We also reviewed the current state of GMO deployment in these countries.
                        </P><H2 class="centered" style="margin: 0"> How was the interactive map coded?</H2><H3>A few words from our computer engineer</H3><P>
                          The online interactive map collects and displays the results of our international GMO survey about. The website was made with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, while the map itself is displayed using D3.js.

Some of these countries also encountered problems from climate change that affects vineyards in Mexico, Spain and Greece (which is not yet represented on the map).
                        </P><P>They spoke with us by Skype and distributed our survey among the winemakers in order to understand how they deal with climate change and introduce Softer Shock as a potential solution. Most of them gave advice for French vineyards on which techniques should be used. To find out more go to “Dialogue with Experts”.

As he has valuable knowledge about websites and data, we organized a meeting during the summer. </P><P> The idea of the interactive map was discussed and what we needed to do so it becomes a valuable tool that can help a lot of people. The aspects highlighted were the importance and the ways to get data. It was advised to build a prototype of the map so we could assess the behaviour of the user. it was suggested that the prototype must contain a limited amount of countries such as the one belonging to the G20 group.Datas must be collected from the prototype so that the project can answer to the visitor’s need. In order to get those datas, the prototype would display a restricted amount of information and the website would be fully accessible only when the survey is filled. This ensure the degree of data filling. Other ways include offering visibility and advertising from partners.</P><UL><P><LI>To see this interview click on <A target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/4/4a/HP-_law%2C_society_and_GMOs_-_Dialogue_with_experts_-_Meeting_Swiper_Good_CEO.pdf">this link</A></LI></P></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><H2>2- Regulation and laws conversation with the Haut Conseils des Biotechnologies (HCB) - 09/26/2017</H2><P> We met Mr Pujol and Mr Rémondet: “Scientific officers” at HBC to enlighten us on all questions concerning GMOs.

                            Here are below the conclusions of the survey we analysed:</P><H3>Temperature changes</H3><P>Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, all saw a drastic climate change this last years. Just below,  are the types of changes they have noticed:</P><UL><P><LI><B>Winemaker 1 and 2</B>:“We have seen the impacts of temperatures in the rapid coagulation of vines”.</LI><LI><B>Winemaker 3 </B>:“There has been a drastic change in temperatures, with significant increases and decreases during different periods of the year. The biggest change has been in the carry-over from all stations, since it seems that seasons have moved on dates and are unpredictable for us”.</LI><LI><B>Winemaker 4 </B>:“There was a mild raise in summer temperatures, but the winter has become more fierce at certain days, while really mild in the rest”.</LI></P></UL><P>In conclusion, in those regions, there is a big impact linked to the climate changements from one season to another that causes each year most of the vines damages.</P><H3>Some data</H3><P>The 4 winemakers interviewed claim of losing vines recently due to severe frost or severe drought.
                                One of the UPV_iGEM team affirms that in Utiel-Requena wine fields are absolutely more affected by frost in winter.
                                “La Rioja’s winter are very severe with temperatures under -10°C more or less”- UPV_iGEM team 2017.</P><UL><P><LI><B>Winemaker 1 and 2</B>:“10% to 15% of vines lost due to climate changes in the worst cases”.</LI><LI><B>Winemaker 3 </B>:“Around 40% of vines lost due to climate changes”.</LI><LI><B>Winemaker 4 </B>:“He don’t know, with accuracy”.</LI></P></UL><P>In conclusion these percentages show a serious problem due to extreme temperatures in the vineyard survival.</P><H3>Techniques to overcome frost or drought</H3><P> Of the 4 winemakers interviewed, 3 use specific techniques to fight against severe frost or severe drought and only one doesn’t use any technique.</P><UL><P><LI><B>Winemaker 1 and 2</B>:“Electric heaters, eventually”.</LI><LI><B>Winemaker 3 </B>:“Prune vines late or early, remove grapes”.</LI></P></UL><P>As we can see, most of this techniques are costly and no powerful enough for next years.</P><H3>Support the use of GMOs to mitigate the impact of climate changes</H3><P>This question was interesting because, it help us to position SofterShock in their society.
                                      In an interesting way, only 1 of 4 winemakers was against using genetically modified vineyards to fight climate disorders because they are not well looked upon by society and legally their cultivation is not possible.
                                      But, all of the 4 winemakers are agreed to use SofterShock on their vines to fight against climate disorders.</P><H3>Opinion about our project</H3><P>Only 3 of them gave their opinion about SofterShock:</P><UL><P><LI><B>Winemaker 1 and 2</B>:“Is an interesting project for the wine industry”.</LI><LI><B>Winemaker 3 </B>:“It has many possibilities but it is a little far from reality”.</LI></P></UL><P>The majority of the winemakers think that SofterShock is safe for vineyards.</P><H3>OTHER COMMENTS?</H3><P>“Keep working on the perception of society and the regulation of modified crops.”- <B>Winemaker from Utiel - Valencia.</B></P><P>Here are some photos from vineyards in Utiel - Requena and La Rioja, the photos were provided by the UPV_Valencia iGEM team.</P><P class="lol centered"> Figure 1: La Rioja, Spain vineyard</P><P class="lol centered"> Figure 2: Utiel-Requena, Spain vineyard</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="background-color:#F59D36;"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row" style="border-top:1px solid #F7F2E9;"><DIV class="col-md-7"><H1 style="font-size: 20px">Igem ionis</H1><P style="font-size: 15px">
