      Protective compounds choices against frost and heat
      </H1><DIV class="igem-container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="colored-container"><P><B>Overview</B></P><P>Once the different methods of Softer Shock application on the leaf
			  and the choice of the expression host have been explored, it is now
			  the time to think of how this latter will perform its protective action
			  at the plant surface. Our core strategy lies in the thermo-responsiveness
			  of our micro-organism, providing a dual response against extreme temperatures.
			  Specific protectants will be synthesized according to meteorological events,
			  and protect the plan from these eventual abiotic stresses.
			  </P><P>What happens at the plant level in case of frost or heat episodes? Which
			  compounds could prevent those deleterious effects?
			  </P><P>During our investigations, we looked through diverse research axis
			  and summarize here the main compounds that appeared the most promising
			  for us.
			  </P></DIV><P>We deeply thank Nicolas Aveline, Camille Lenoir, Christian Huyghe, Guillaume Charrier,
		Ido Braslavsky and Maya Bar Dolev for their valuable pieces of advice. Through several interviews,
		these experts helped us better understand the complex physiological mechanisms of heat and
		frost damage on plants. They also guided our choices concerning our different protective
		compound candidates. You can find the complete interviews in written form below:

These events are characterized by sudden temperature drops, often happening at night, and can result in severe <B>production losses</B> as well as an alteration of fruit characteristics of the following harvest <SUP>2</SUP>.
		</P><P>The mechanism of ice crystal formation, called <B>nucleation</B>, is one of the main factors causing diverse interlinked types of damage at various scales. Ice crystals growing extracellularly create <B>cell dehydration</B> through the reduction of available liquid water<SUP>3</SUP>. When exposed to prolonged freezing temperatures, the formation of larger ice masses through the <B>recrystallization</B> process can mechanically affect <B>plant tissues</B> and <B>internal structures</B><SUP>4</SUP>. Facing these challenges, we tried to find the best strategy to preserve the most vulnerable organs and tissues by producing specific protectants at the plant surface.
		</P><P>Ice-Binding Proteins (IBPs) have the ability to bind ice crystals and operate different actions on them. Among this particular protein family, <B>Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs)</B> encircle crystals to inhibit their growth. <B>Ice-Nucleation Proteins (INPs)</B>, on the other hand, act as nucleation cores to promote ice formation<SUP>5</SUP>. These apparently contradictory actions rely on similar mechanisms help reducing frost damage in their own way.
		</P><P>Our first strategy is the most intuitive: producing antifreeze proteins at the plant surface to inhibit crystal growth. Part of natural protection mechanisms in wintering plants, these proteins bind ice crystals and limit their expansion <SUP>6</SUP>. Since external and internal ice crystal formation seem to be interrelated<SUP>7</SUP>, the prevention of ice crystal formation externally could have a real impact on <B>inhibiting recrystallisation</B>, and <B>lowering the water freezing temperature</B>.
		</P><P>Among the numerous AFP types expressed in Nature, a particular AFP type called
		RiAFP, taken from the freezing-avoiding beetle <I>Rhagium inquisitor</I>, seems particularly
		suitable for our objective in terms of action and synthesis requirements. When expressed
		at 15°C, its high thermal hysteresis activity could significantly reduce the risk of ice
		formation and indirectly protect inner tissues <SUP>8</SUP>.
		</P><P>What is also interesting with AFPs is the perspectives offered by protein engineering
		and isoform synergistic effect. The latter refers to the fact that different AFP isoforms
		operating together give a better antifreeze efficiency than the sum of the same isoforms
		taken separately. These two strategies enhance the protein activity, making these
		compounds even more interesting <SUP>9</SUP>.
		</P><P>Our second strategy is opposed to the first one, but could be of equally interest.
		Producing ice-nucleating proteins at the plant surface to favor ice formation. This is
		the basic principle of water aspersion, one of the most commonly techniques used by
		wine-growers to protect vines from frost. The mechanism relies on the release of latent
		heat from this exothermic reaction as well as the insulating properties of the ice layer
		formed <SUP>10</SUP>. Coupled to the aspersion method, ice-nucleating proteins could significantly
		optimize the process and allow high water savings.
		</P><P>We are not the first ones to consider modulating ice crystal formation to protect
		plants in the context of the IGEM competition. As an example, the project “PlantiFreeze”
		of 2014 Weston team consists of the production and secretion of AFP by <I>E.coli</I>.
		<A href="https://2014hs.igem.org/Team:CSWProteens">(https://2014hs.igem.org/Team:CSWProteens)</A></P><P>Additionally, in the 1980’s, a product called Frostban was developed by using genetically
		modified ice-nucleating bacteria. The goal was to knock-out the Ice-nucleation protein gene
		to engineer a replacement for naturally occurring ice-nucleating bacteria that were on the plant
		leaves and were responsible for frost damage. The strategy was different from ours because it
		relied on massive spraying of GMOs that were supposed to compete with their natural counterpart<SUP>11</SUP>. 
                While the product was proven to be efficient, numerous GMO related controversies made it
		impossible to commercialise. We did a case-study of Frostban in our Wiki <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:IONIS-PARIS/applied-design/frostban">here</A>, do not hesitate to go
		there if you want more details!
		</P><H2>Heat Protection</H2><P>At high temperatures around 40°C, many crops including grapevines suffer from
		protein denaturation, as well as water stress and solar radiation damage. Despite
		automatic stomatal closure, <B>water loss</B> by evapotranspiration can cause severe <B>dehydration</B>
		of tissues <SUP>12</SUP>. In addition to temperature increases, a direct exposure to solar
		radiation enhances the number of harmful free radicals inside the cells and can damage
		them. Shriveled fruits are a main consequence of <B>solar damage</B><SUP>13</SUP>. Protecting grapevines
		from excess sunlight could significantly help farmers to deal with climate change,
		leading to an increase in the frequency of heatwaves and droughts.
		</P><P>Some plants and animals have the property to adapt their <B>albedo</B>, the ability
		of a surface to reflect sunlight, according to their environment. The desert plant
		<I>Encelia farinosa</I> produces leaves covered with white trichomes during the drought season.
		This induces a considerable albedo increase and reduces the heat loading of leaves,
		limiting water loss and high temperature stress <SUP>12</SUP>.
		</P><P>We hypothesized we may reproduce this albedo augmentation by creating a physical
		barrier against solar radiations. This can be achieved by making our microorganism
		produce <B>white reflective compounds</B> at the leaf surface. The challenge was to find white
		molecules that could be expressed on the plant without compromising its functions or the
		existing microbiota.
		</P><P>We tried to find our inspiration in nature, and it turned out that
		different compound types take a white coloration. Proteins such as casein,
		main protein of milk, are already used for industrial purposes and could be
		of interest for this objective<SUP>14</SUP>. However, their nutritive nature could
		potentially disturb the regular biodiversity<SUP>15</SUP>. Biopolymers such as chitin
		and its derivatives also own interesting reflecting properties, and appear
		neutral for the plant <SUP>16</SUP>. Another interesting approach is the biomineralization:
		some bacteria can precipitate mineral ions like calcium carbonate and cover
		surfaces with a white layer <SUP>17</SUP>.
		</P><P>Fighting against heat-related crop damages through albedo modification is an area of active research. For example, a product called Invelop composed of talc was developed to reduce exposure to solar radiation and also to fight against certain parasites<SUP>18</SUP>. Reflective surfaces are even engineered to cool down rooftops! <SUP>19</SUP></P><FIGURE><P><B>(Left)</B> Scanning Electron Microscopy image of tube-like calcium-containing minerals possibly entombing S. pasteurii shaped cells<SUP>14</SUP><B>(Center)</B>:Sprinkling technique in a vineyard <B>(Right)</B>:Desert Plant <I>Encelia farinosa</I> during drought season </P></FIGURE><P>Want to learn more about the effects of extreme temperatures on plants, and our different research approaches to protect them?
