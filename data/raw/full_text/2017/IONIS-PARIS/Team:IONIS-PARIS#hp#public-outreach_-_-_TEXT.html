High school Presentation
Objectives
One of our major objectives for this presentation was to show to students the biology from                 a new point of view and to speak with them about the fun, the goals, the perspectives and the                 limits of this science. Moreover, we wanted to do a presentation to high schooler to help                 them discover a new domain of application of biology, the synthetic biology with concretes examples                 of its application. Also, it was a great occasion for us to present our project softer shock and the IGEM competition.
Our presentation
Our presentation was cut into three different parts, the first one is to help them discover               what is synthetic biology with example of its applications and concretes examples of modified organism               for each application. In a second time, we warned them about the limits of the synthetic biology for the               human health, on the biodiversity, ethics, and what the law permits us to do. In the other hand, we also               spoke about the perspectives of synthetic biology. Finally, we present the iGEM competition and our project.               To stimulate them, we also challenged them with question about their general knowledge on biology and their logic               on synthetic biology.
The card game
To help students have a better understanding of synthetic biology, we created a card game with simple rules:
Make teams of 4-6 members.
Pick 3 green cards representing organisms.
Pick 3 yellow cards representing DNA vector.
Finally pick 1 red card representing problematics.
The goal of the game is to solve the problematics thanks to a new property that will be given to an organism.
A member of the team will present their modified organism with a short story.

Objectives
This year we presented Softer Shock to several audiences, from students to seniors,               to get their point of view and develop the project according to society’s needs.
Presentation of softer shock at the Sèvres mayor’s office and the Department of Val de Marne.
On Thursday, April 27 we had a meeting to present our project to the mayor’s office of Sèvres’.                   A part of our team went to this meeting to present the iGEM and our project (what is our goal to improve agriculture).                   We presented the scientific and ethical aspects of synthetic biology in youth education and our qualifications                   for the grant. They were very interested in our project and the potential results. We were awarded a grant of 1 000€                   for participating in the student science education, and congratulated for our enthusiastic participation in such a                   competition. For our first professional presentation it was a very good experience!
With the same goal to present our project for fundraising but also to have different perspectives and                   advice on softer shock we met some representatives of the Val de Marne Department. Our project consits of                   different parts. First, we present the context and the history of the iGEM competition. Then we explained what                   made us different from other teams -  our pluridisciplinarity and complementarity. We then explained the technical,                   scientific and ethical aspects of our Softer Shock project. We concluded the presentation with the project budget and                   the our requirements for accomplishing Softer Shock. We were awarded a 1 500€ grant, they were confident in our project                   and wanted to help us to start our proof of concept.
Our participation in the French Science Festival
The Science Festival in France, held annually since 1992, is a day of science presentations and                 demonstrations in public spaces. The goal is to provide an appealing introduction to science for the youth,                 as well as provide a opportunity for informed dialogue between the general public and working scientists on                 science in current events.
In order to present synthetic biology and some of its applications (of which our project is only one example)                 we presented Softer Shock to other students.
On Thursday October 12 we worked at the Musée des Arts et Métiers (The Museum of Arts and Trades, emblematic as the                 cradle of French engineering). We  presented different applications of synthetic biology tools.                 We had 2 groups of 4 girls in the 10th grade. These were very interested and returned with knowledge                 and the desire to learn more!
The next day we went to the University of Orsay, also famous for its historical standing science.                     There, we met two classes of science-track high school seniors. During our presentation we played a synthetic                     biology card game with them to show that science is a matter of creativity, ideas, and the desire to innovate in                     particular. Based on current problems, students had to propose a solution (a “mini iGEM project”) with a chosen organism                     and the functionalities they could give them. A few students gave some funny solutions that might be tomorrow's innovations.                     It was very interesting to discuss with students and have their point of view. They were interested in our project and asked                     many questions about synthetic biology and its limits.
The Softer Shock iGEM special week
Another way we communicated about our project was to organise an entire week of iGEM events in our school.
We decided to organise an iGEM week from 05/08/17 to 05/12/17 to promote our project, sell home made food, and invite           people to look at our softer shock project.
It worked very well and when students came for food they asked about our project: Why did we choose this name?           What is the goal of this competition? What is the main purpose of Softer Shock? They were interested in our specific           project but also in the larger iGEM competition.
We also had a conference with few third year students at our school, who are interested in taking part in the iGEM           competition next year.
We asked them to produce a video describing a previous iGEM project in an entertaining way. The winning team got             free tickets to the prom!
Here is the link of the winner's video.
Bravo to this team, they all enjoyed participating in the activity and had a few ideas for next year's competition.
Finally, some pledges were organised to challenge students with biology. One of the funniest was to disguise one               person from each of the student unions (Sharkomère and Western Shot)  as a bacterium and explain to us their properties.
Here are the 2 best bacteria:
In conclusion, this week was exhausting, but it was very interesting to exchange with others. Moreover we got a lot           of positive feedback and interesting ideas about Softer Shock that were used later in the development of our project. We succeeded in communicating about our project and this worldwide competition. Even if it was a stressful week         it allowed us to practice coordination and build team spirit.
Thanks to all these experiences we know how to talk about our project and inform young people through introductory         science education. It was a very rich experience to exchange with everyone because of their valuable questions and remarks.
Meetups
Parisian Meetup - 07/21/2017
We had the chance to be invited by the Pasteur iGEM team at         the Parisian Meetup the 07/21/17 to meet all French teams and present our project.
The day started with a breakfast around which we made a first relation with the presented teams. Then all teams presented         their projects. We were able to exchange about our difficulties, our successes and advise us for the continuation of the         competition.  Moreover some teams such as Bettencourt asked for our help in model a part in their project, in their case         they wanted us to aid them to model their RNA organelle strands. We started a new collaboration and it was a pleasure to         help them.
After teams presentation each team had to pitch in front of everyone. At the end the jury had to choose the best         pitch and the winner won a teddy. The winner was the team of Toulouse with their project “Croc’n Cholera”. Finally they         split us in several groups to do little workshops, in our case we had a conference with an entrepreneur who quickly taught         us how to pitch properly for D-Day! It is important to present yourself correctly and to draw attention to a subject that is         important to us.
In conclusion, it was an incredible experience in which we had for the first time a professional presentation as a         mini Jamboree. We had the opportunity to meet other French teams, exchange ideas, points of view, learn from each other and         live an iGEM experience!
Since that day, we have been in touch and collaborating with some French teams such as Bettencourt, Grenoble and Pasteur.         We want to thanks the team Pasteur for this great adventure!
LEUVEN MEETUP - 10/07/2017
The KU Leuven team invited us to the iGEM symposium they have organised. The symposium was the 7th of Octobre in         Leuven in their university. The goal of this meeting was to meet teams, we were 5 teams to be present (München, Aachen,         Amterdam, Leuven and us) but also to practice for the oral presentation and for the poster.
We first had the pleasure to have a lecture in medical devices from one of their professor which was really interesting and         we learned many things about what we could do with medical devices and how we can employ them.
After the first lecture we started the teams presentations, it was fascinating to hear all teams and learn from them,         give them opinions, advice for Boston.
After teams presentation we had the last lecture from their PI about the life as a scientist. It was an amazing         lecture, we were all emotionally touched and it remind us the real work as a scientist to be in contact with the society         all the time and feel what we do, do it with passion and nothing else.
We finished the symposium with the poster presentation. Each team had to talk about their project briefly, and comment         the other posters.
The symposium they organised was a really nice adventure, in which we learned and shared many things, we went back         home with new friends, a lot of advice and comments about how to improve our poster presentation and our oral presentation.         We gave them back advice too.
It was a very great and helpful experience. We also had the time to visit the city of Leuven, which is a very cute city.
We want to thanks the Leuven team for inviting us to their symposium and for receiving us to their place to spend the night!
Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
