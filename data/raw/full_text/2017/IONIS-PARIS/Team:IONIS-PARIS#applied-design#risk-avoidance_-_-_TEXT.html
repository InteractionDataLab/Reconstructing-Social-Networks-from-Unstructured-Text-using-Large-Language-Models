Risk avoidance: Biosafety strategies
Overview:
Biosafety occupies a large part of our project. Indeed, the microorganisms that are contained in our solution Softer Shock are intended to be spread in the environment. Since it is a major concern here in France, we decided first to understand why, but mainly to find the best solution for our case.
Context
If engineered microorganisms are highly regulated, it is for many different reasons, as their               spreading would cause a possible biodiversity imbalance and a species competition because               of the organism presence in the environment, an increase of antibiotic resistance because of               a genetic material transfer or even hygiene issues in the worst case. Also, this regulation               primarily exists because of ethical questions, which is the main genetically engineered               microorganisms issue. Although our microorganisms do not carry any real toxic compound,               we chose to develop the project’s biosafety at its maximum1,2,4. To do so, in the biosafety aspects of Softer Shock, we chose to create a four walls fortress, which means a multi-layer strategy.
Figure 1: Biosafety fortress
Our first wall is the auxotrophy, and we aim at engineering our organism so that it                 becomes dependent to a specific component: it is also called nutritional isolation.                 Here, we chose to make them depend to a 21st amino acid, which is not found in                 nature. Unless it has an access to this synthetic amino acid, the organism dies: it                 is confined in the area where the amino acid is spread.2,3,6
Figure 2: Synthetic Auxotrophy
Our second wall is composed of a killswitch, to kill our organism under certain inputs. It permits the avoidance of a microorganisms spreading. We chose to use the protegrin-1 , which causes a membrane poration and so the cell death. Once its sequence is included in our organism genetic code with an arabinose operon, it would be activated in the presence of arabinose, making it easy for the farmers to kill our organism after harvesting2.
We also thought of adding a DNAse coding sequence in our plasmid and an “anti-DNAse” coding sequence in the genomic DNA of our microorganism. If a DNA transfer occurs between a modified and a wild type organism, the wild type organism which does not contain any anti-DNAse would die5. With the same idea, RNase/anti-RNase couple can be used. For instance the couple Barnase/Barstar (toxin/inhibitor), from B. amyloliquefaciens is a good candidate for this function12.
Figure 3: Killswitch and anti-Horizontal Gene Transfer strategy
For our third wall, we are actively looking for the most adapted chassis and we                 already have some tracks of naturally present organism on vine leaves and specific to                 the leaf environment. However, the perfect chassis does not exist, as if it                 extremely specific to the grapevines (so little present) a mass spraying could alter the                 biodiversity and on the contrary, if it is less specific the safety level would be                 lowered9,10,11.
Figure 4: Chassis choice
Our last wall is the physical containment. We decided to use the tunnel sprayer (see figure 5), in                 order to diffuse our product and to add some adjuvants to facilitate its use. This                 device is based on a “face to face” model in which each of the product dispenser face                 each other. It seems to be a good choice because the product that is sprayed on one                 side and doesn't end up on the plant is harvested by the panel on the other side.                 Also, it permits the deposit of the spray on both surfaces of leaves. The adjuvants                 would be a drift limitant, a bounce and shatter minimiser and a sticker and                 retention aid7,8.

Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
This year we are 20 members from different schools:18 students from Sup’Biotech1 student from e-artsup1 student from Epita Read more …
