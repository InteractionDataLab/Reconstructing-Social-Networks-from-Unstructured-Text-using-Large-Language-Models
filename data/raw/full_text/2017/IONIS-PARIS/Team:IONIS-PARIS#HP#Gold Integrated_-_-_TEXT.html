Overview Human Practice
Overview
This year, communicating with industries and engaging with the general population was the cornerstone of our human practices. On this page, you will see what we did and our achievements for the silver and gold medal.
Public outreach
One of our major objectives was to sensitize students to synthetic biology in high schools. We presented different applications in many domains and we asked them to play a game to create their own biological tool to answer a problematic. We also participated to several events such as the iGEM week, “La fête de la science” and two iGEM meetups to promote our project. This page will show you what we did on public communication and ethic reflexion about Softer Shock.
Society, law and GMOs
In this tab, you will see our innovative approach to inform the population with an interactive map that gathers information about GMOs all around the world. Moreover, we wanted to be as close as we can to the reality concerning the industry on plants protection. Consequently, we met many experts in the regulation, plant protections or climate changes to answer to all our issues concerning Softer Shock.
Perspectives
We want to continue doing scientific vulgarisation for the iGEM competition. After meeting EuropaBio, we found a partnership to communicate about synthetic biology and its activities concerning green biotechnologies. In this tab, you will see our collaboration.
WHAT DID WE DO?
Public Outreach for the Silver medal
Human practices is just as important as the scientific aspect because                   communication and the people's agreement is crucial for the acceptance of new                   technologies. In order to achieve our goals and promote synthetic biology, we organized events, meetups, lectures and talks with different people in our society.
Raising awareness among younger students can sometimes be hard! We wanted to                   show that our world is full of biotechnology, whether it be in health, agri-food                   or cosmetics. Therefore our team designed an original, innovative and fun card                   game to be used for next iGEM IONIS generations. This game allows students to put                   themselves in the shoes of a scientific engineer, like an iGEM participant!
Because engaging with the general public is so important, we created two surveys                   and translated them into several languages such as Spanish, German, Arabic, Chinese,                   and others with the help of friends and relatives. The first was aimed at consumers                   in order to obtain a large collection of data concerning the public perception of GMOs as well as social                   acceptance of SofterShock.  The second was sent to the farmers (winemakers) to obtain                   information about climate change in their                   geographical area and also their opinion about SofterShock.
Society, Law and Regulation for the Gold medal
The right perception of GMOs is a key issue today                   in many countries. That’s why we discussed with several experts and iGEM teams about                   GMO controversies. We also tried to find  the correct way to educate the population.
This year, our team created an innovative and original integrated human practices work.
We are developing an interactive map to visualize social perception of GMOs, regulations,                       and research news. We wish to bring new information to the greater public,                       allowing them to rebuild their own opinion about GMOs. We also wish to help future iGEM teams to know more about the current                       status of GMOs all around the world.
Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
This year we are 20 members from different schools:18 students from Sup’Biotech1 student from e-artsup1 student from Epita Read more …
