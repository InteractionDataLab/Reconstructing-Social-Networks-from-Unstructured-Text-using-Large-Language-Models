iGEM is a unique opportunity, in which we can prove our skills, learn and discover         new ones. Bring new ideas and improve science working together. This competition         means a lot to me, I had the opportunity to learn how to become a chef leader,         listen to the group, make decisions and exploit my passion for synthetic biology.

I joined the IGEM IONIS because IGEM is a unique experience  both scientific         and human. It’s a great opportunity to improve my lab and communication skills         and my scientific knowledges.         A long project as IGEM project is very different of projects I did previously         and it’s a good overview what we may expect in our future professional activities.

What attracted me in the iGEM competition was the liberty we have as students to         construct a project from scratch! It was a very interesting experience that allowed         me to improve my teamwork skills and also to learn a lot in the molecular modeling field.

I decided to participate to the competition because they had cookies. It was also because         being part of such a big competition was a personal challenge for me, I wanted to learn         many things and to improve my skills. Team working is not easy every day but it makes         the little successes even more greater!

I chose to participate in the project as it was a unique experience. It made me learn         what working as a team really meant, as well as improving my skills and discovering new         methods and scientific tools. I wanted to bring something complementary to the project,         something we did not see at Sup’Biotech. That was modeling.

I’m glad I’ve had the opportunity to be a part of this team, and to handle the whole         marketing and fundraising part of it. It has been a real challenge, and I enjoyed         every moment of it.

Laboratory experiments
Sup’Biotech - Master 2 R&D - Paris
I am part of the R&D team and I mainly work in the lab. I like trying to find         solutions to problems that we have during our experiments. I chose to do that         because I love molecular biology and I wanted to learn more about it. I also         love travelling and eating chocolate.

Sup’Biotech - Master 2 Production - Paris
iGEM is a way to challenge myself with studies and sport at the same time.         Also, it is a unique and formative experience because we are 20 persons in this         team which make us a small enterprise. Being responsible of the marketing team         was a great opportunity and allowed me to develop new skills.

Conference + Event organisation
Sup’Biotech - Master 2 R&D - Paris
I chose to participate to this amazing once in a lifetime experience. This taught         me to work efficiently in a group, improve my skills in a field I had never worked         in before. I chose to be in the marketing team to discover how to communicate with         companies, to organise event for a scientific purpose.

I decided to participate to this competition because it is a huge opportunity to grow         and learn what is the professional world. And also because it is a human and scientific         experience that we can live only once!

The field of synthesis biology is very interesting and I wanted to invest myself into         this kind of project from the beginning to the end. It is the first time I work on a         project we lead to concrete results through bibliography and fundraising  and that we         carry out by our own.

I am convinced that Nature is the best engineer in the world, and find it         fascinating how humans can use its genius to solve problems through synthetic         biology. And even more when it comes to our dear precious French wine. That         is why I chose to put my efforts into this wonderful experience, which leads         us to be creative and to push our own ideas further!

Hey there, my name is Thomas, part of the modelling dream team! I joined the IGEM         project as a science one, to discover that’s a human project with scientific problems         and crazy people in it!

iGEM was for me an excellent way to test my skills and improve myself. This competition         brought a lot to me and I will never forget the great moments and experiences I lived through it.         With the iGEM I learned to imply myself entirely in a project dear to me and to integrate and         exploit what I have learnt with my passion for science.

I chose to participate to this once in a lifetime experience to prove even if we are students         we can show the skills of engineers, be professional and overcome difficulties to carry out the project.

I joined iGEM as I am very interested in the entrepreneur world. iGEM represents a fabulous experience         to built a project from the to the conception to the fabrication of the product.

I chose to be R&D team manager in order to have a first  experience managing a group, and         to increase my laboratory skills. It is not always easy to make people work together but         with many effort and time it is so rewarding to have a real result.

Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
This year we are 20 members from different schools:18 students from Sup’Biotech1 student from e-artsup1 student from Epita Read more …
