Overview
Overview Applied Design
From its conception to its application, the Softer Shock final product required us to explore as many aspects as possible. What was interesting is how the product evolved in complexity with time and how enriching it was to explore many subjects that were unfamiliar to us at the beginning.
The product itself is of course very theoretical but we took the opportunity given by the iGEM context to explore as many tracks as possible and use recent technologies. With this product development and our market study, we hope to show you that creating a synthetic biology product for crop protection is possible and very interesting.
Here is how we designed our product and what we plan to do to protect grapevines:
Figure 1: The Softer Shock organism preparation
Figure 2: The Softer Shock organism application
Each step is very complex and needs us to take many parameters into account. For example, the spray, when applied, can drift away from its initial target and spread in the surrounding environment.
The most important point for us was to make a realistic product and to compare it to already existing ones. To this end we contacted many experts, some of which gave us a lot of their time in various interviews. These experts showed a lot of enthusiasm for Softer Shock and it was really instructive to talk to them.
We want to express and communicate the knowledge we accumulated. Each tab is associated with a report and its summary, with all the important points mentioned. We explored several aspects:
FOLIAR APPLICATION
CHASSIS SELECTION AND MICROBIOTA ANALYSIS
BIOSAFETY
PROTECTIVE COMPOUND CHOICE
ECOTOXICOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY STUDY
How to apply our product and what difficulties to consider?
What host will we choose and how will it develop on the leaves and fruits
Maximizing the biosafety of our project by creating a four wall fortress!
Our brainstorming and strategies to protect from frost and heat
What would be the impact of our product on human health and the environment
You can access to each part by clicking on the corresponding image!
You will also find here a case study on Frostban, a GMO product designed to prevent frost damage that failed to be commercialised. We judged interesting to study such product to try to learn from it and see how it was developed and evolved in the 80’s.
We sincerely hope you will enjoy the Applied Design of Softer Shock as much as we did!
Igem ionis
Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
This year we are 20 members from different schools:18 students from Sup’Biotech1 student from e-artsup1 student from Epita Read more …
