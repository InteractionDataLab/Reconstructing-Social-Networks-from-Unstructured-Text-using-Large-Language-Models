This construction allows the regulation of translation of amilCP RNA depending on temperature.</LI></DIV><P>This year we have decided to create two new parts. One of the part will allow the expression of the blue chromoprotein amilCP at low temperatures. This BioBrick design is inspired by the cold-shock protein family translational regulation system. Several similarities are to be observed with the parts from the UNAM-CINVESTAV team from Mexico in 2010, but we added features and modified the sequence. We wish to continue the work that has been done on the cold-shock protein pattern and induction at low temperature.Our second part is mRFP (red chromoprotein) transcriptionally regulated by a strong promoter called pL, itself repressed by a protein that dimerizes called cI857. This part ensures the transcription of the mRFP only at high temperatures.Our ultimate goal is to assemble those two parts and form one single BioBrick that will be adaptable to any protein (we will need to replace the AmilCP and mRFP by any other coding sequence), composing a thermo-inducible plasmid adaptable to any situation.

We added the DSBox (Downstream Box) sequence at the N terminus, which increases the translation of mRNA at low temperatures (Mitta et al, 1997).  At low temperatures translation of most transcripts is strongly reduced. The DSbox is a cis-acting mRNA element enabling assembly of the translation pre-initiation complex, likely through interaction with ribosomal protein S1 (Studer et al 2006, Duval et al, 2013, Qu et al 2012).You can find the part in the registry <A target="_blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2282001">here</A></P><H3><U>References</U></H3><LI>Masanori Mitta et al, Deletion analysis of cspA of Escherichia coli requirement of the AT-rich UP element for cspA transcription and the downstream box in the coding region for its cold shock induction, Molecular Microbiology (1997) 26(2), 321–335</LI><LI>Studer, Sean M., and Simpson Joseph. “Unfolding of mRNA Secondary Structure by the Bacterial Translation Initiation Complex.” Molecular Cell 22, no. 1 (April 7, 2006): 105–15. doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2006.02.014.</LI><LI>Duval, Mélodie, Alexey Korepanov, Olivier Fuchsbauer, Pierre Fechter, Andrea Haller, Attilio Fabbretti, Laurence Choulier, et al. “Escherichia Coli Ribosomal Protein S1 Unfolds Structured mRNAs Onto the Ribosome for Active Translation Initiation.” PLOS Biology 11, no. 12 (December 10, 2013): e1001731. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001731</LI><LI>Qu, Xiaohui, Laura Lancaster, Harry F.

It is believed to be one of the master regulators of the cold-induced translation of cold-shock mRNA at low temperatures. The 5’ UTR contains a regulatory sequence called “Cold Box”​ that plays an important role in the stabilisation of the mRNA at low temperature (ATTAAA) (Mitta et al, 1997). The structure of this 5’UTR is extremely unstable at high temperature, as it is believed to be cut down by a RNAse, leading to a 12 sec mRNA stability at 37°C against 20 minutes at 15°C, temperature at which the RNAse is no longer active (Barria et al. 2013).
        Source of this part The 5’UTR sequence has been taken from the NCBI GenBank on the Cold-shock protein A gene sequence. Mitta et al, 1997 clearly indicated its position so we just had to take the sequence from here.

This promoter plays a role in transcription, though does not relate to the translation regulation (DSbox, 5’UTR). The CspA promoter is considered to be a strong promoter (Mitta et al., 1997).

AmilCP is a chromoprotein that has already been successfully used by several iGEM teams and leads to a strong color visible to the naked eye (The protein has an absorbance maximum at 588 nm) but also a temperature-dependent expression when used with a weak promoter. The double terminator enables robust termination of transcription. <FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="centered marged">Figure 2.

The double terminator provides robust termination. AmilCP is a coral chromoprotein which displays a strong blue color. With this part we can evaluate the impact of the DSBox on the coding sequence of the protein and see if amilCP expression is modified as well as its properties (colors, time of folding).Adding 15 nucleotides to a protein coding sequence raised some concern about its effect on protein stability and activity. We addressed this problem with molecular modelling to optimize the placement of the DS Box and confirmed the results in the lab.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="centered marged">Figure 3.

The 5’ UTR contains a regulatory sequence called “Cold Box”​ that plays an important role in the stabilisation of the mRNA at low temperature (ATTAAA) (Mitta et al, 1997). The structure of this 5’UTR is extremely unstable at high temperature, as it is believed to be hydrolysed by an RNAse, leading to an average lifetime of 12 seconds stability at 37°C, as opposed to 20 minutes at 15°C, a temperature at which the RNAse is no longer active (Barria et al. 2013).

The construct is composed of a cI857 coding gene behind the strong constitutive promoter J23100 and RBS and an mRFP behind a pL promoter that is regulated by the gene cI857 and RBS. Both cI857 and mRFP coding genes are in front of a terminator.</P><P>Leftward promoter (pL) derived from phage ƛ is fully repressed at low temperature by the thermolabile cI857 protein. cI857 loses repression activity on the pL promoter when the temperature rise above 30°C until 42°C, when it can no longer bind to pL. The aim of this construct is to code for mRFP when the temperature rises above 30°C, while the transcription is repressed under 30°C.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><P>This part sums up our final heat sensitive construction. The overall strategy we chose is complex and we were not sure it would work. Our bibliographic review and analysis of the Paris-Saclay iGEM 2017 project (using DNA thermometers) we decided to use strong promoters (Anderson BBa_J23100 with its respective RBS and pL promoter) to obtain higher expression levels.</P><P>We had a slight problem in sequence design with IDT because their system detected our double use of double terminators as concatemers and did not let us introduce the same double terminator BBa_B0015 so we change the double terminator of the new part by an E.coli terminator operon. </P></DIV></DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION class="centered marged">Figure 10: Anderson constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100) - RBS (BBa_B0034) - cI857 gene (BBa_K098997) - Double terminator (BBa_B0015) - pL promoter (BBa_K2282004)  - RBS (BBa_B0034) -mRFP (BBa_E1010) - Double terminator (E.coli his operon terminator) (BBa_K2282014)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>You can find the part in the registry <A target="_blank" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2282013">here</A></P><H3><U>References</U></H3><LI>Norma A Valdez-Cruz, Luis Caspeta, Néstor O Pérez, Octavio T Ramírez, Mauricio A Trujillo-Roldán - Production of recombinant proteins in E.Coli by the heat inducible expression system based on the phage lambda pL and/or pR promoters - Microbial Cell Factories 2010, 9:18.</LI></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="background-color:#F59D36;"><DIV class="container-fluid"><DIV class="row" style="border-top:1px solid #F7F2E9;"><DIV class="col-md-7"><H1 style="font-size: 20px">Igem ionis</H1><P style="font-size: 15px">
			  Is an association created by Sup’Biotech student in 2015. Since this first participation, two teams (2015 and 2016) won the gold medal and several nominations: « Best presentation », « Best applied design », and « Best environmental project ». The strength of the IGEM IONIS comes from its multidisciplinarity and its complementarity.
