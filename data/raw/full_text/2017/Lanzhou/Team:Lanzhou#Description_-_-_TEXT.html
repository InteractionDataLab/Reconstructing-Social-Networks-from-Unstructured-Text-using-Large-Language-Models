Description
Although the war between desertification and human beings has never been halted, the existing methods are highly time-consuming and funds-costing such as physical approaches with straw barriers and chemical ones with surface immobilization. To change the situation, we are to develop a novel biological way with the technology and theory based on Synthetic Biology: Produce a engineered strain immobilizing sands and preventing evaporation of water to delay the process of desertification.

Project
Develop an engineered strain which can secrete colonic acid(one kind of exopolysaccharides preventing water vaporing and forming soil aggregation) using E.coli as the microbe chassis
Release different amount of colonic acid according to temperature changes
Produce a novel biological bacterial fertilizer with this engineered strain
Develop a general secreting system which can be used under different microbe chassis.
