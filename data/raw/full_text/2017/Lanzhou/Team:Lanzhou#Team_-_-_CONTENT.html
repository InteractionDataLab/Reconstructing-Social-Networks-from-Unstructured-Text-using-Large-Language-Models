						It's a coincidence for me to attend the iGEM in 2016, and I never thought that everything could get this far. The meaning of iGEM to me is not just a competition, which is more like an adventure and a mission. As team leader, It's a great honor to fight with such excellent team members for one goal together. 
						
						During the year, we have got over many obstacles as well challenged ourselves many times.
						
						I believe that the battle is to the brave and persevering, the final victory belonging to us!

						I'm a senior student of bioscience in Cuiyin Honours College of Lanzhou University.

						Hi, my friends. Here is Ren Yi, one of &quot;craftsmen&quot; in our team. In your words, I'm a experimentalist. 
						
						Personally, what we create is a kind of Bio-weapon which can kill weeds &amp; pests in purpose of defending cropland. And don’t be worried man, we also developed scabbard for it.
