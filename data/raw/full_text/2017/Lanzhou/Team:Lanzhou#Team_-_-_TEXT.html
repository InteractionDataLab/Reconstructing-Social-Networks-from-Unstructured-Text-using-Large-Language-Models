He Jindian
Leader
It's a coincidence for me to attend the iGEM in 2016, and I never thought that everything could get this far. The meaning of iGEM to me is not just a competition, which is more like an adventure and a mission. As team leader, It's a great honor to fight with such excellent team members for one goal together.
During the year, we have got over many obstacles as well challenged ourselves many times.
I believe that the battle is to the brave and persevering, the final victory belonging to us!

"The more deep I dive into biology, the more things I don't know."
I'm a senior student of bioscience in Cuiyin Honours College of Lanzhou University. Becoming a teacher as my vocation of bioscience then having pupils everywhere is my dream, also a duty, I think. In our team, I major in experiment and give technical supports to our team to which I can give a best play.
Practicing then mastering sword is what I'd like in doing in P.E.

I am Huang Zonghui, a senior student in Lanzhou University who majors in biology. In our team, I play the role of doing experiments and working on some art design.
Through preparation for iGEM I have promoted a lot, especially in experimental skills. Also, I gained a lot of knowledge of synthetic biology.
In the past year, our team has experienced regrouping and we've been through many difficulties. It's lucky for the rest of members, and I believe we will get a good result!
Ren Yi
Lab / Art design
Hi, my friends. Here is Ren Yi, one of "craftsmen" in our team. In your words, I'm a experimentalist.
Personally, what we create is a kind of Bio-weapon which can kill weeds & pests in purpose of defending cropland. And don’t be worried man, we also developed scabbard for it.
Outside of iGEM, I am keen on going camping and playing more than ten different sports. In addition, here's an advice: never listen "Hop" when you stay in lab.
Wang Jiaming
Lab / Art design
The young brave, welcome to our workshop! I am one of the technicists. We are forging a legendary weapon. However, the iron ore was used up. As a lefendary technicist, I don't understand why there is such a lack of materials. But it just happened. So, if you can bring...........
Feng Huan
Lab / Art design
I am a freshman in team Lanzhou. At first, I feel so confused when there is a team discussion or experimental operation, but I still try my best to learn and practice. During the year, I have promoted a lot.
In my daily life, I always dip myself into library and laboratory where will make me enrich and relax. And I am sure that thinking and exploring will give variety to life.
Finally, I want to thank my teammates and the chance I gained to attend iGEM, this experience wil be the Most Precious Fortune in my college years.

I'm Jin Zhecheng from Lanzhou iGEM team. Now I'm major in biology in Cuiying Honors College in Lanzhou University. In the team, I'm in charge of the experiment and English writing. In the leisure time, I'd like to keep playing basketball and table tennis as my hobby. As I'm one of the youngest team members, I still have a lot to learn from senior team members for the experimental skills. And I really gain a lot from our preparation for the competition. The course is both interesting and somewhat harsh. Pain past is pleasure!
