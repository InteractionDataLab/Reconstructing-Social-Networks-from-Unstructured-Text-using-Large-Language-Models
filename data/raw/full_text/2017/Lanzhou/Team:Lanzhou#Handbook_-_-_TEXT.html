It has been estimated that at least three million cases of pesticide poisoning occur worldwide each year, with 220,000 deaths. The majority of these poisonings occur in developing countries where lack protection against exposure, health risks knowledge and safe use, but with an easy access to harmful pesticides. And the dangers of pesticide use to human health mainly caused by long-term occupational exposure.
So we determined to write a handbook about the knowledge of normal pesticides, the health risks, the right protective measures as well introdution of our bio-pesticides to users.
And this handbook is going to change those farmers who often use pesticides, so that they would pay attention to the poisoning or environment problems they neglected before. Which will let them know how to protect themselves better and maybe they will choose our bio-pesticides which might be an approach to better their health and environment in the long run.
