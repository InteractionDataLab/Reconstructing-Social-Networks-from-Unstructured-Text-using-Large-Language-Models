This forum mainly focused on Genome synthesis and editing, Parts and chassis, Circuits Design and Dynamic Functions, etc. Especially, one project elaborated a four-stable state switch coincided with our pro-project.

							From July 1<SUP>st</SUP> to 2<SUP>nd</SUP>, several team members of 2017 Lanzhou iGEM team have attended the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Synthetic Biology Young Scholar Forum hosted by The Key Laboratory of Synthetic Biology, CAS, which will take place at Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, SIBS, CAS.
						</P><P class="mdc-typography--body2">
							This forum mainly focused on several projects including Genome synthesis and editing, Parts and chassis and Circuits Design and Dynamic Functions etc. During this forum, our team member has listened critically to the contents of these reports, learnt and understood large amount of novel research ideas, broadened our horizons, deepened our perception and recognition of synthetic biology, and immersed us into the wide range of application possibilities in synthetic biology. One project which has elaborated a four-state switch has totally triggered our intense interest and willingness of discovery. To be honest, we have previously considered designing a four-state switch to control the synthesis and release of certain chemical substance in the <I>E.coli</I>. And the previous dilemma was that these large circuits might take up too many intracellular resources and our designed circuits might not work. However, after acknowledging this applicable approach, we are looking forward to applying this into our design of the project related to dealing with the desertification.
						</P><P class="mdc-typography--body2">
							Our team has harvested many valuable ideas about most cutting-edge researches and most novel designs after this forum and obtained the eternal charming from synthetic biology.

							Seven team members of Lanzhou iGEM team have attended CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Committee) in FAFU(Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University) from August 26<SUP>th</SUP> to 28<SUP>th</SUP>. CCiC is mainly aimed to set up a communication platform for the iGEM teams in China so that Chinese teams may have the opportunity to fully discuss over their projects, help with each other and learn from each other.
						</P><P class="mdc-typography--body2">
							At the conference, we have introduced our project design, current progress of our project and Human Practice. Professor King L. Chow from HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) as a judge of CCiC has shown great interest in our project. And we have discussed a lot over our design of project after our presentation with Professor King L. Chow. During the rest time of this conference, we have exchanged our ideas with other Chinese iGEM teams and learnt from with each other. Especially, we have established a long-term collaboration with NUDT (National University of Defense and Technology) and TMMU (Third Military Medical University).
						</P><P class="mdc-typography--body2">
							We have genuinely gained a lot during CCiC at FAFU this time. Discussion and communication with professors, experienced iGEM members and current iGEM teams offered us plenty of inspirations not only on construction and inheritance of the team, but also on design of our project. Furthermore, we have learnt numerous good projects presented by other teams during this conference. 
						</P><P class="mdc-typography--body2">
							Lastly, we sincerely hope that every iGEM team can realize their initial dream!
