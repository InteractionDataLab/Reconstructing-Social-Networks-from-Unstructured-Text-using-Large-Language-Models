Our human practices focused on one single purposeâ€”better design, in the spirit of caring and changing the world.
The total work contains 6 aspects: public engagement, education, consulting experts, conference communications, questionnaires and designing a Bio-pesticide handbook. Also, we have gained a lot of valuable information about the society, the advice and feedback which offered a positive effect on our project and optimized our design in every aspect, from experiments, device to modelling.
At the same time, with social responsibility, we also contributed a lot to the society, whatever in education or popularization of science because we want to make the world a better place through our efforts.
Besides, due to our hardship this year, we did a special work to reflect the situation and problems of iGEM teams in China. We sincerely hope our experiences could not only inspire the future iGEM teams to go through their hard time but give some directions to solve possible difficulties they would meet.
We really appreciated all the support we have received from the society and relevant communities in our HP work.
