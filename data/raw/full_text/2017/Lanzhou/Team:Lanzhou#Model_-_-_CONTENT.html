				1. For a wider application scope, we synthesized RNAi data from different kinds of plants for determining a range of dsRNA length which is suitable for as much as possible species.

				RNAi differs widely in different plants species, as expectation, the R2 of figure one is too low to give a credible and precise data analysis, but there still a trend could be referred.
