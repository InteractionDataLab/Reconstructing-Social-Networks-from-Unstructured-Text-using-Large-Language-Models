Splice MIT
Splice Modelling Intronic Technology
Overview
SpliceMIT is a tool to generate antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) for a given DNA/RNA sequence, and then analyze and output the most effective ASOs. This tool could be used for a variety of scenarios. For our test samples, SpliceMIT was used to generate and analyze the gRNA sequences (complementary to the region on the intron) in the CRISPR â€“ dCas13a system to control alternative splicing by targeting mRNA sequences.
