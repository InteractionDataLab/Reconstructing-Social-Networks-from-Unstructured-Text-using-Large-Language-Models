The plasmid construction process was complicated; however, the following lab summary compiles the many steps taken over the summer to get where we are now. Many of the protocols mentioned can be seen here .
Once we had built our plasmids, we needed to transiently transfect them into mammalian cells. Below is a spreadsheet of all the transfections we ran:
