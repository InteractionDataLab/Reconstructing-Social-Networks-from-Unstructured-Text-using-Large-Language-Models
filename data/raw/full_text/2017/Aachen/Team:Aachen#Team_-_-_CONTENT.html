	</P><P id="two"> One of the most important things regarding iGEM is that this competition is so much about teamwork. When we all
	met for the first time in January, we were just 16 people from different academic backgrounds who wanted to learn more about
	synthetic biology and what it’s like to work in the lab. We didn’t really know what we were getting ourselves into – and 
	that so many unsuccessful PCR’s, disappointing sequencing results, exhausting lab nights and quite a lot of discussions and 
	quarrels were ahead of us. 
	Now we’ve worked together for almost 8 months, and have really become a team. Despite of some inevitable problems and issues, 
	we overcame difficulties and realized a project we’re very proud to present at the Giant Jamboree in Boston. 
	Most of us were part of different subgroups, like Lab, Wiki, Fundraising or Human Practices, and learned heaps of new things. 
	But of course iGEM wasn’t only about work – we participated in great events, like the European Meetup in Delft, the 
	German Meetup in Dresden or the Practice Jamboree in Leuven. We did quite a few teambuilding activities and had a lot of fun 
	together. All in all it was an unforgettable time, we made many new friends along the way and gained valuable experiences.

						He studies Biotechnology and decided to join iGEM because it was a great opportunity to learn a lot of
						new things. There haven’t been many days Adrian wasn’t motivated to work. Even after some of his 
						important DNA fragments were accidentally thrown away and we didn't know whether to laugh or cry, 
						he kept up his good work. With all the efforts Adrian’s making, he surely is going to knock out all
						the genes. And as if all this risky lab work wasn’t enough, Adrian also likes to boulder in his free 
						time.</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><DIV class="portrait_box"><SPAN class="portraitcaption">Caspar Eichler</SPAN></DIV><DIV id="caspar" class="popup_box"><H4 class="popup-caption">Caspar Eichler</H4><H4 class="popup-undercaption"><I>Biotechnology B.Sc.</I></H4><H4 class="popup-description">Caspar is a very dedicated goal-oriented person, who is not amused about 
						people having different opinions than his own, and only gives in when a good argumentation stands 
						against him. When Caspar wants something, he’s not afraid of just going to important people without 
						an appointment and there is no door which can stop him till he has got what he wants. He is also very 
						cautious about the scientific correctness of the lab work. Not a mystery that in almost every case his 
						work is absolutely correct! In his spare time, he sails the world and rebuilds classic cars.</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><DIV class="portrait_box"><SPAN class="portraitcaption">Svenja Lützow</SPAN></DIV><DIV id="svenja" class="popup_box"><H4 class="popup-caption">Svenja Lützow</H4><H4 class="popup-undercaption"><I>Biotechnology B.Sc.</I></H4><H4 class="popup-description">Let us introduce you to Svenja or “Jaja”, 22-year old bachelorette who is interested in travelling, Ultimate and coffee. 
						She is constantly late, maybe because she is not averse to occasional partying, but we can very much rely on her as a treasurer for Team Aachen and in planning our trips.
						Originating from Zwickau in the east of Germany, she moved to Aachen to study Biotechnology. Tearing down walls, social and economic, is in her DNA: 
						She is involved in a development aid organization as well as a meeting point for refugees.</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><DIV class="portrait_box"><SPAN class="portraitcaption">Jonas Bäßler</SPAN></DIV><DIV id="jonas" class="popup_box"><H4 class="popup-caption">Jonas Bäßler</H4><H4 class="popup-undercaption"><I>Chemical &amp; General Mechanical Engineering M.Sc.</I></H4><H4 class="popup-description">Jonas, a chemical engineer, joined this year’s iGEM team against an 
						overwhelming majority of Biotechnology students who have absolutely no clue what he is talking about 
						when he explains the math behind his hardware project. A typical day in the lab consists of 10 people 
						running around, while Jonas calmly and fully concentrated sits on his chair, developing a 3D-printed 
						model of our hardware. Jonas is going to spend the next semester at UC Los Angeles
						, so unfortunately, he’s not able to attend the Giant Jamboree.

						she became an expert of all the coffee and craft beer shops our city has to offer. Johanna is part of 
						lab team “JoTho”, our trafo-tried dynamic duo, and besides works on making our wiki, Instagram account,
						flyers, posters and outfits look splendid. She decided to join iGEM in order to get some new, practical

						Biotechnology! Although he is already advancing our project in the lab as part of the unbeatable

						couldn’t be more easy-going… really, that’d be impossible. He’ll always work hard to deal with the 
						task at hand, even though he’ll usually start a little bit late (after midday is just the perfect time).

						(except maybe plant identification subjects), Fabian ambitiously and relentlessly works on perfecting 
						our project. Being the COO of our team, he organized a project at his old school, lots of talks with 
						politicians and our participation in many events. Fabian also loves uploading new Trello cards and 
						consequently generating Slack notifications in the middle of the night, driving the rest of us almost
						crazy. To calm down after a long and thrilling week of iGEM, he enjoys to go fishing.  </H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3"><DIV class="portrait_box"><SPAN class="portraitcaption">Milan Sobota</SPAN></DIV><DIV id="milan" class="popup_box"><H4 class="popup-caption">Milan Sobota</H4><H4 class="popup-undercaption"><I>Biotechnology B.Sc.</I></H4><H4 class="popup-description">Milan is a 20-year old Biotechnology student, he loves fitness, games

						our website, as he’s the only one skilled in this area.  His second most time-consuming activity in 
						iGEM is to enjoy coffee. Milan has an ambiguous relationship with university (and life itself): on the 
						one hand, he can forget about all lectures and all duties for a whole semester, but beyond this he can 
						learn two months straight for only one exam. This ambivalent behaviour can be referred to as `the Milan
