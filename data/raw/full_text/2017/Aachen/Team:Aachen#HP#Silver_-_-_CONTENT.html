									We regard an iGEM Project to be successful when being influenced by external people and influencing our fellow men and women with our ideas. 
									We did this by educating students on synthetic biology, developing our project with the input of researchers and industries and distributing 
									discussions on water scarcity as a serious issue with everyone we cooperated with. But, when thinking about the possible realization and 
									impact of a project, one has to keep in mind politicians as the people deciding environmental actions when elected. 
									Therefore, when impacting people with our ideas, it is in our eyes necessary to talk to politicians about environmental 
									issues and innovative ideas and political questions that arise while talking to people cooperating with us.
								</P><P class="SafText" style="text-align:justify;">
									During our project, we got a lot of input from students, industries, and researchers on political environmental issues. With these information, we

									German policy on environmental action and biological education.

										The answers show that water scarcity is considered as a moderately serious issue with an average of 6.3, however, they 
										see it rising to nearly 8 in the next 15 years. Interestingly our experts handed in significantly higher numbers than 
										the average. They evaluated the problem worldwide today with an average of 9.0, the problem in 15 years with 9.7.

										The results show that the environmental issue we are working on is identified by different groups as a serious issue.

										it is interesting that experts working on water treatment consider the issue more negative than university and high school

										The results on these questions are significantly lower than on water scarcity worldwide. The participants answered the question on water 
										scarcity with a value of 3.5, meaning they do not consider it as serious. Even clearer is the value on tap water quality with 2.5, 
										the lowest value of all questions. The values appear obvious since in most regions in Germany you do not have to care about drinking 
										water from the tap and currently there is no limit of water usage in Germany due to high rainfall throughout the year.
									</P><P class="SafText" style="text-align:justify;">									 
										In this regard, the value on rivers in Germany surprises somewhat with 5.1, a moderate value. However, all in all, the survey shadows a

										With this information, the participants answered our question on the seriousness of the Chloride-concentration with a comparatively high value of 7.2, meaning the issue

										We concluded that people are aware of the problem caused by polluted rivers if they are aware of these pollutions. However, most of them do not know this. The result 
										gives us guaranty that it is worth it to work on exactly this issue. Even if we are not successful with our approach, it is important to spread the awareness on water 
										pollution here in Germany to people not related to the topic and show possible approaches to solve these problems and other problems as well in the future.

									Genetic Engineering has got a mixed reputation in Germany, however, it is mostly ill-reputed, especially green biotechnology, whereas medical biotechnology is uprated in comparison. We asked ourselves how do our participants rate genetic engineering and how do they rate it when genetic engineering is integrated into wastewater treatment plants for environmental action as we are doing it. After rating genetic engineering in general, we provided them with the following text and asked them to rate genetic engineering in this context as well: “With our idea, we aim to separate water from salt ions in for example wastewater treatment plants with the help of genetically modified organisms and therefore desalinate it.”

										While genetic engineering, in general, is seen neutrally with an average value of 4.6, the participants rated genetic engineering in an 
										environmental approach with 3.0 more positive. It was striking that these questions polarized our participants, answers between the values 
										1 and 8 were submitted. For us the result showed again that we are on a good way with our project, however, we expected more negative results 
										on these questions. We asked politicians in conclusion how they think about genetic engineering and why they think genetic engineering is 
										ill-reputed in Germany, although our results draw an altering picture.
									</P><P class="SafText" style="text-align:justify;">									
										The results gave us important feedback on the necessity and impact of our project. Additionally, the answers correlate with societal and

									We consider education as probably the most important thing to achieve progress in future. Therefore, we visited several 
									classes in two schools, located in Northrhine-Westfalia, to talk about synthetic biology, to give the students a better 
									understanding of synthetic biology and our work, and, probably the most important part, show them possibilities for their

											We think that you learn the most when you are directly related to a certain kind of project. To show the students that 
											synthetic biology, seeming to be a technology which is far away from realization, is actually possible to do in their 
											classroom, we designed primers using the gene editing software Geneious and performed experiments to amplify a gene 
											fragment via PCR we will utilize for genomic integration later on with the students. We chose this kind of experiment because 
											it is possible to perform it outside of a security level 1 lab. Gene amplification emerged therefore as the best experiment 
											to accomplish both including the students and safety of the experiments at once. In addition, we performed experiments with 
											the students to isolate microorganisms from their environment, making agar-media, breeding the strains and microscoping them 
											for determination.

											In our laboratories, we worked with antibiotic resistance markers to select positive strains. However, the massive release 
											of antibiotics worldwide leads to a growing number of antibiotic-resistant strains. Our cooperation partners asked us about 
											this issue and how we want to solve it with regards to biosafety of our yeast.

									A discussion that is being conducted is the question of whether an increased release of such resistances into the environment 
									takes place where the sewage treatment plant runs into the water. And the spread of these [antibiotic resistances] is the point 
									of criticism.

									Laboratories are not the causers of the current problems, but a genetically modified yeast, carrying antibiotic resistance genes 
									in an environmental application must be seen critically. We tackled this by assuring that our mutated genes do not carry 
									antibiotic resistances, either by using auxotrophy markers or deleting the corresponding genes.
								</P><P class="SafText" style="text-align:justify;margin-top:17px;">									
									In addition, we went into dialogue with our cooperation partners regarding the comparatively bad reputation of genetic 
									engineering in Germany. Discussions showed that the main reason for this is the fear of release of genetically modified 
									organisms, which would destroy our environment as it occurs now.

									Our aim to provide ways to prove that a release into the environment is not inevitable is in this regard even more important.

									Youth Researches is a scientific competition for German high school or university students, not bordered by Biology, but focusing on different sciences. We presented our project idea to these students, all of them focusing on a scientific and research background.
								</P><P class="SafText" style="text-align:justify;">
									Around 20 students followed our invitation to our research campus in the beginning of June. We held a presentation on our project, answered many questions and guided the students around our lab space. To talk to students who are interested in scientific questions and work on research projects on their own was highly interesting for us. First, critical questions always help while developing a project, secondly, we hope that we have given them an understanding of synthetic biology, eventually influencing their prospective plans.
