MEET THE TEAM
How it all began...
One of the most important things regarding iGEM is that this competition is so much about teamwork. When we all  met for the first time in January, we were just 16 people from different academic backgrounds who wanted to learn more about  synthetic biology and what it’s like to work in the lab. We didn’t really know what we were getting ourselves into – and   that so many unsuccessful PCR’s, disappointing sequencing results, exhausting lab nights and quite a lot of discussions and   quarrels were ahead of us. Now we’ve worked together for almost 8 months, and have really become a team. Despite of some inevitable problems and issues,   we overcame difficulties and realized a project we’re very proud to present at the Giant Jamboree in Boston. Most of us were part of different subgroups, like Lab, Wiki, Fundraising or Human Practices, and learned heaps of new things.   But of course iGEM wasn’t only about work – we participated in great events, like the European Meetup in Delft, the   German Meetup in Dresden or the Practice Jamboree in Leuven. We did quite a few teambuilding activities and had a lot of fun   together. All in all it was an unforgettable time, we made many new friends along the way and gained valuable experiences.
Adrian Rendón
Adrian Rendón
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Our half German, half Mexican and always-ready-to-spice-things-up friend.       He studies Biotechnology and decided to join iGEM because it was a great opportunity to learn a lot of       new things. There haven’t been many days Adrian wasn’t motivated to work. Even after some of his        important DNA fragments were accidentally thrown away and we didn't know whether to laugh or cry,        he kept up his good work. With all the efforts Adrian’s making, he surely is going to knock out all       the genes. And as if all this risky lab work wasn’t enough, Adrian also likes to boulder in his free        time.
Caspar Eichler
Caspar Eichler
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Caspar is a very dedicated goal-oriented person, who is not amused about        people having different opinions than his own, and only gives in when a good argumentation stands        against him. When Caspar wants something, he’s not afraid of just going to important people without        an appointment and there is no door which can stop him till he has got what he wants. He is also very        cautious about the scientific correctness of the lab work. Not a mystery that in almost every case his        work is absolutely correct! In his spare time, he sails the world and rebuilds classic cars.
Svenja Lützow
Svenja Lützow
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Let us introduce you to Svenja or “Jaja”, 22-year old bachelorette who is interested in travelling, Ultimate and coffee.        She is constantly late, maybe because she is not averse to occasional partying, but we can very much rely on her as a treasurer for Team Aachen and in planning our trips.       Originating from Zwickau in the east of Germany, she moved to Aachen to study Biotechnology. Tearing down walls, social and economic, is in her DNA:        She is involved in a development aid organization as well as a meeting point for refugees.
Jonas Bäßler
Jonas Bäßler
Chemical & General Mechanical Engineering M.Sc.
Jonas, a chemical engineer, joined this year’s iGEM team against an        overwhelming majority of Biotechnology students who have absolutely no clue what he is talking about        when he explains the math behind his hardware project. A typical day in the lab consists of 10 people        running around, while Jonas calmly and fully concentrated sits on his chair, developing a 3D-printed        model of our hardware. Jonas is going to spend the next semester at UC Los Angeles       , so unfortunately, he’s not able to attend the Giant Jamboree. Thanks for your great work!
Johanna Stotz
Johanna Stotz
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Meet Johanna, our 24-year old, soon-to-be bachelorette…. straight outta        Wuppertal. She trained as a pharmaceutical technician before studying Biotechnology in Aachen, where        she became an expert of all the coffee and craft beer shops our city has to offer. Johanna is part of        lab team “JoTho”, our trafo-tried dynamic duo, and besides works on making our wiki, Instagram account,       flyers, posters and outfits look splendid. She decided to join iGEM in order to get some new, practical       experience and brightens up the lab with her cheerfulness (as long as you don’t forget to refill the       pipette tips!).
Niels Hollmann
Niels Hollmann
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Meet Niels, our youngest team member (sweet age of 20), who is the only        team member lining up for his hometown – Aachen. Since 2015 he is studying the best course ever:        Biotechnology! Although he is already advancing our project in the lab as part of the unbeatable        dream team “NOLS” - he engages for Design and puts his effort into Human Practices. Niels special        talent is the creation of stunning presentations. He is very motivated and productive – as long as        he doesn´t meet Fabian, then no one can take him serious anymore.
David Corredor
David Corredor
Biology B.Sc.
Now’s the time to present our most effective team member: David Corredor.        David, coming from lands far away where the temperature is kinder to the skin, has learnt through years        of practice to master the law of minimal effort. He’s always ready to have a laugh, enjoy life and        couldn’t be more easy-going… really, that’d be impossible. He’ll always work hard to deal with the        task at hand, even though he’ll usually start a little bit late (after midday is just the perfect time).       To dissipate excess energy, David likes to play tennis.
Fabian Wittmers
Fabian Wittmers
Biology B.Sc.
Introducing --- Fabian, anchorman of our weekly team meetings, initiator        of most of our collaborations and busy wiki-writing bee. Driven by a deep passion for Biology        (except maybe plant identification subjects), Fabian ambitiously and relentlessly works on perfecting        our project. Being the COO of our team, he organized a project at his old school, lots of talks with        politicians and our participation in many events. Fabian also loves uploading new Trello cards and        consequently generating Slack notifications in the middle of the night, driving the rest of us almost       crazy. To calm down after a long and thrilling week of iGEM, he enjoys to go fishing.
Milan Sobota
Milan Sobota
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Milan is a 20-year old Biotechnology student, he loves fitness, games        and good meals! Through fundraising Milan got us a lot of money, and he’s also responsible for creating       our website, as he’s the only one skilled in this area.  His second most time-consuming activity in        iGEM is to enjoy coffee. Milan has an ambiguous relationship with university (and life itself): on the        one hand, he can forget about all lectures and all duties for a whole semester, but beyond this he can        learn two months straight for only one exam. This ambivalent behaviour can be referred to as `the Milan       experience`.
Nora Junker
Nora Junker
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Meet Nora Junker, 20 years of age, fighting for Team Aachen with her        knowledge of living in the heart of German agriculture: Rheda-Wiedenbrück. As a boot camp for this        battle of life she started studying Biotechnology back in 2015. She is part of the youngest lab dream        team „NOLS“. Great name, …right? Additionally, she works on Design, Human Practices and eliminating        all the mess her lab partners leave behind. Nora got famous for being the fastest pipetting member        iGEM Aachen ever had and is always friendly and good tempered - as long as Fabian and Niels are apart        from each other and her PCRs are performing!
Thore Diefenbach
Thore Diefenbach
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Now’s the moment to get to know Thore  aka “Toto”, surname: Diefenbach,        home village: Diefenbach. Thore is a warmhearted and ambitious country boy who dances through the lab        and pipettes fairylike to his favorite jam. But watch out: if you try to accuse him of being home for        dinner too late or talking too much he will turn you down with a passionate, but well-meant, "Halt die        Fresse!" (= Shut your face). Thore is our DIY-enthusiast. Whether you need help fixing a curtain rod,        want a tomato patch on your balcony or would love to live in your own lakeside hut – he’s your man.
Gerolamo Rota
Gerolamo Rota
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Gerolamo, better known as “Gerry” or - sometimes - “Lab-Mussolini”, is        adding some temperamento italiano to our group. Originating from the north of Italy he came to Germany        for studying, but is rumoured to still have some powerful connections in his home country... Gerry can        be described as a passionate and adorable Italian who isn´t afraid of yelling at people – so approach        with caution! Being always the first person in the lab and often the last one leaving, he’s a real asset        to our team. You just have to follow one rule: Don´t try to convince him that he’s wrong. Broken bones are       not worth it.
Sergio Molina
Sergio Molina
Electrical Engineering & Biology B.Sc
If you search for an example for the word "restless" in the dictionary,         9/10 times you'll find a picture of Sergio. Despite of studying Electric Engineering as well as Biology,       working at an institute and being part of the iGEM team, this guy still finds a way to have a social        life. Mr. Molina offers the team a constant source of motivation through his friendly companionship,        insightful opinions and excessive use of the word "Besssschte". Baking a cake for being late (a rule only temporarily applied in our team) was no problem for Sergio: having trained as a confectioner back        in Colombia, he treated us to the most delicious Oreo-Cheesecake ever.
Henri Hayungs
Henri Hayungs
Biotechnology B.Sc.
Henri is a 22-year-old student originating from Berlin, who ended his        early acting career to find his true purpose in Biotechnology. He is passionately curious and will not        stop asking until he gets to the very bottom of a cause, even if it’s driving the questioned to the        verge of despair. Combined with his openness, warmth and energy this makes him a real workhorse in the        lab. Henri does a lot of sports, like badminton, and enjoys the competition that comes with it. Being        musically gifted, he plays the piano and the guitar while he also likes to refine his understanding of        music by listening.
Michael Gobs
Michael Gobs
Biotechnology M.Sc.
Meet Michael, one of our hardware guys and a Master student of        Biotechnology. Also being engaged in the software control, he makes sure that our pumps work        straightaway. Before moving to beautiful Aachen, he spent some time  studying in the equally rainy UK. Beside being part of the iGEM team, Michael is participating in        two other student organisations, with one of them brewing its own beer. Finding time for all these        commitments isn’t always easy. If Michael has some time left, you will find him highly concentrated        poring over books.
Supervisor
Without the help and support of our three supervisors, we wouldn’t have been able to   realize our project (or even decide on a project idea). Thanks for all your input, advice and time!
Prof. Dr. Lars Blank
Prof. Dr. Lars Blank
Institute of Applied Microbiology, RWTH Aachen University
Professor Blank supported us and our project massively the entire time.        He not only welcomed us in his laboratory and provided us with a lot of equipment and supplies, he was        also always available for questions. We really appreciate him taking the time to meet with us repeatedly       , giving us feedback on ideas and presentations and helping us to refine our project concept.

Professor Schwaneberg provided us with a bench in his laboratory as well        as all the equipment we needed, including enzymes, chemicals and lab supplies. In many meetings he        discussed our project idea with us, gave useful advice and introduced us to members of his team who        could help us with certain issues. We’re very grateful for the amazing support that he and his institute have        given to us and previous iGEM teams.
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiechert
Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiechert
Institute of Bio- and Geo-Sciences, Forschungszentrum Jülich
Professor Wiechert from the Forschungszentrum Jülich was a great help to us. He not only visited us in Aachen and gave us important advice throughout all the different stages of our project, but also connected us with many experts from the research centre. Furthermore, he invited us to the Biotech Day in Jülich, where we had the chance to present our project, make valuable new contacts and also had the opportunity to listen to some awesome presentations by world-renowned experts. And last but not least, Professor Wiechert contributed significantly to our modelling and helped improve our presentation.
