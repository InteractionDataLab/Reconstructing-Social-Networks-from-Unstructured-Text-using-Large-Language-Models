Engagement
Designing a thoughtful iGEM project requires asking which problems synthetic     biology can best help solve and exploring the impacts of your work in the world.

Human Practices
From the first hour, our project has been based on and developed through input we got from external supporters. Together with representatives of Industry,      Research and Politics we have worked on detecting problems, shaping ideas and establishing political dialogues.
Human Practice
Environmental Projects demand social awareness on environmental issues and ethical considerations. We have visited schools, held presentations and conducted conversations to shape awareness on      water pollution on the one hand and biosafety and environmental      impact of GMOs on the other hand.
Collaborations
National and International exchange and collaborations among each other are an essential part for every iGEM Team. We have worked together with teams from Germany, Europe and Northern America in matters of laboratory work, research, mentoring and discussions.
