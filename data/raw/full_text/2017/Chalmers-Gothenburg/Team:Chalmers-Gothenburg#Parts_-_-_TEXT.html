Parts summary
Submitted parts
Table 1 shows the parts that were submitted. All biobrick parts work in S. cerevisiae and are compatible with the RFC[10] standard.

Improvement of a previous biobrick part
BBa_K2329000 is an improvement of the earlier biobrick part, BBa_K740000 . The improvement of the cre-lox recombinase system was done by changing the loxP site from reversible switch to a non-reversible switch. The loxP sites flanking the promoter was changed to mutated loxP sites, see Figure 1 [1]. The new mutant loxP sites (lox66 and lox71) have showed great success since the direction of the promoter did not flip back.
Figure 1. Illustrated figure of the non-reversible flip. When the double mutant loxP site is produced through recombination, the promoter will not be able to flip back.
Central parts which worked as expected
BBa_K2329001 and BBa_K2329002 are two central parts of our project, as replacing the native GPCRs STE2 and STE3 is vital to ensure that the only GPCR present on the yeast cell is the heterologous GPCR introduced by us.
Non submitted parts
Table 2 shows the Basic Parts which were not submitted due to time constraints. We chose to present them here anyway to perhaps help studies for iGEM teams in the future.

Characterization of BBa_K2329004
BBa_K2329004 was another part that got characterized. We incorporated a mouse GPCR called Olfr1258 into S. cerevisiae which showed successful results in membrane localization and response to its ligand 2-butanone.
