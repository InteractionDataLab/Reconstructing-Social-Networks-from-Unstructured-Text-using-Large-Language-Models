The biggest inspiration to creating our biosensor was the <B>iGEM team TU Delft</B> of <B>2012</B>. Their way of using GPCRs and the olfactory system in <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> to detect methyl nicotinate in tuberculosis patients was what first that gave us the idea to our design.
<B>St. Mark's School of Texas iGEM Team</B> project of <B>2014</B> gave inspiration to direct the project to focus on lung cancer.
<B>iGEM Lund</B> and <B>iGEM Uppsala</B> helped us by sharing our survey on Facebook.
