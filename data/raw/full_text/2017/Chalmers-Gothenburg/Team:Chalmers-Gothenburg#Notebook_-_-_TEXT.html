Introduction
We have carefully summarized our hard work in the lab in the following journal. The document contains what has been done during the summer and a short description of the results.
Since all members of our group were eager to spend the summer in the lab, we divided the lab work into different sub-projects to increase the structure of our work and to increase the work efficiency. Each team member then joined one subgroup to work with one specific part of the project.
Sometimes our beloved instructor Raphael Ferreira helped us with some tasks and also appears in the journal occasionally. Read more about our hero by clicking here.
