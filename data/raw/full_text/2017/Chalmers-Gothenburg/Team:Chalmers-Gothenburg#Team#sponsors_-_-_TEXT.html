Introduction
We want to thank all our sponsors for contributing financially and with products necessary for our project and attending the Jamboree. Without your financial help we would not have come as far as we have today! Here we want to introduce our sponsors and how they have helped us. If you want to know more about them, you can click on their respective logo to visit their websites.
Companies
Agilent Technologies
Agilent Technologies Inc. is the world's premier measurement company and a technology leader in chemical analysis, life sciences, diagnostics, electronics and communications. The company's 20,000 employees serve customers in more than 100 countries. They provided us with a SureVector Core Kit #G7514A.
ATUM
ATUM is the leading bioengineering solutions provider. Founded in 2003, ATUM (formerly DNA2.0®) offers an integrated pipeline of solutions for the research community, including platforms for protein and vector engineering, products such as expression vectors, fluorescent and chromogenic proteins, cell strains and reagents, as well as gene design, optimization, synthesis and cloning. They provided us with genes for a value of 1500 USD.
Eurofins
With EUR 2.54 billion in annual revenues and over 30,000 employees in around 375 sites in 41 countries, Eurofins Scientific is a leading international group of laboratories providing a unique range of analytical testing services to the pharmaceutical, food, environmental and consumer products industries and as well as to governments. They provided us with discount on sequencing and primers.
GATC-Biotech
GATC-Biotech has its roots deep within the field of Sanger sequencing. Founded in 1990, the company commercialised the first nonradioactive sequencing technology platform. We received 50 barcodes for free sequencing with SUPREMERUN DNA sequencing of our constructs.
Genscript
GenScript is the leading gene, peptide, protein and antibody research partner for fundamental life science research, translational biomedical research, and early stage pharmaceutical development. During their tenure, they have built the best-in-class capacity and capability for biological research services encompassing gene synthesis and molecular biology, peptide synthesis, custom antibodies, protein expression, antibody and protein engineering, and in vitro and in vivo pharmacology – all with the goal to Make Research Easy. By winning a GenScript Bronze-level scholarship we received 500 USD as a stipend to spend on their products.
IDT
IDT is a leader in development and manufacturing of products for research and diagnostic life science markets. The world’s largest supplier of custom nucleic acids, IDT serves academic research, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical development communities with products that support applications including: next generation sequencing (NGS), gene amplification, SNP detection, expression profiling, gene quantification, and synthetic biology. We received free DNA synthesis (both genes and primers) up to a value equivalent to 20 kb gBlocks. .
NEB: New England Biolabs
NEB is a leader in the discovery and development of molecular biology reagents, restriction enzymes and others. They provided us with a mastermix for fusion assembly.
SnapGene
SnapGene is the first molecular biology software that is easier to use than pen and paper. Now every DNA construct made in your lab can be documented in a rich electronic format and thanks to the free SnapGene Viewer, the files can be shared with colleagues around the world. They provided us with free licences to use their software.
Schools and Institutions
Life Science Engineering, Chalmers Area of Advance
Life Science Engineering study fundamentals and provide engineering solutions to the Life Science sector, including health care, the food industry, and the biotech industry. Their work contributes to the development of a sustainable society, where biotechnology is used for sustainable production of fuels, chemicals and materials. They provided us with financial support.
The Division of Systems and Synthetic Biology, Chalmers University of Technology
Provided us with lab space, equipment, material and all the chemicals and biomaterials used during our project, as well as financially funding our team in order to send us to the Jamboree in Boston. We are all very thankful for everything you have done for us!
Chalmers MasterCard
The foundation at Chalmers that gives financial support to student driven projects at the university. We are extremely grateful that they decided to help our team.
Others
Swish
Thank you to everyone who have financially helped us with the project through Swish. Every SEK counts!
