Isabel Runneberger
Student leader, Wet lab
M.Sc. Biotechnology student interested in synthetic biology and tissue engineering. In charge of the lab and gene designs. Yeast transformations with electroporation and color changes are my favorite things in the lab. Outside the lab, I spend time around horses and  cameras.

Amanda Ristinmaa
Student leader, Wet lab, Funding
Second year master student interested in protein engineering. Joined iGEM because I love learning and want to know how it is to work on a team together! Teamwork is the best work.

Julia Larsson
Wet lab, Modeling, Wiki
Third year Biotech Bsc student who will take a master in Engineering Mathematics.                         Joined iGEM to get more experience the lab, since I’m leaving that world behind soon.                         Took the honorable position as wiki-master when no one else could.                         I think I did a decent work.

Angelo Limeta
Wet lab, Modeling
I’m about to start my M.Sc in biotechnology this fall and joined to get more experience working both in the Wet and dry lab. Using mathematical models to simulate results is something I really enjoy and plan to do in the future!

Julia Jonsson
Wet lab, Social media, Funding
Second year biotechnology masters student interested in tissue engineering and pharmaceutical research and have come to love synthetic biology this summer. I entered the iGEM team hoping to learn a lot about start up, operate and finish a project within a certain timeframe!

Sofie Gunnarsson
Wet lab, Funding
Second year biotechnology master student that joined iGEM to get more wet lab experience for my master thesis project that I just started this fall. But also to get the chance to learn how to plan and execute a research project from the beginning.

Elin Johansson
Wet lab, Human practices
Third year Biotech Bsc student who recently started master in Biotechnology. Joined iGEM to get experience of planning and executing your own project and of course to have a lot of fun while doing it. When not in the lab, I’m obsessing over cats.

Tuva Wegnelius
Wet lab, Human practices
First year Biotechnology masters student. I joined the iGEM team because I want to become a scientist doing research in biotechnology one day. This is a great chance to develop my skills creating and working in a cool scientific project.

Linnea Kristenson
Wet lab, Human practices
M.Sc Biotech student fascinated by tissue engineering and biomaterials. Joining iGEM gave a great opportunity to develop a project, a perfect intro to my master thesis this autumn and a great experience for life. My eye for details rendered me the epithet The proofreader this summer.

Tove Widén
Wet lab, Human practices
Just started master in biotechnology. Joined iGEM to get more lab experience and follow a project from beginning to end, and to have a cool summer! (Yes, the office is very cold.)

Alex Hedin
Wet lab, Human practices
I’m in my third year and will start my M.Sc in Biotechnology this fall. I have always dreamed about doing a “real” science project and iGEM gives me the opportunity to do a project from the start to the end. It’s also a chance for me to gain some skills and knowledge!
