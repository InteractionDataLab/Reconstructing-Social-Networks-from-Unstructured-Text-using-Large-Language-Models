We bring different people and knowledge together, among many other things. We decided on our project idea during the first half of May, after a month of intense and independent brainstorming process. All the experiments, constructs, code, wiki and results documented on our Wiki were performed, written and collected by us, gEco. We truly appreciate all the support and advice we received from all the people involved in our project.
