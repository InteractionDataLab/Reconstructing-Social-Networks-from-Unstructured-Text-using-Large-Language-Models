Collaborations
IISc Bangalore
The team from IISc Bangalore intended to make software for easy counting of cells from Haemocytometer, to remove the errors caused by human counting. To test its efficacy in various environments, they collaborated with different teams to test their software. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the species and followed the protocol provided by IISc Bangalore to grow and measure the number of cells in a haemocytometer. We took the images at 10X and 20X as they required the usage of an air objective. We counted 720 plates and the results are as follows:
Graph for IISc collaboration
Due to some problem we observed a decrease in the growth curve at time point 10 and 11. However, it recovered in the subsequent time points indicating that the problem might be in sampling.
DEI Agra
We helped the DEI Agra team to guide them into iGEM. We mentored them at every point of time and in every aspect we could. We tried helping them with their Wiki page as well.
Greece
The iGEM team from Greece made a device - pANDORRA, a pipeline for the construction of modular RNAi-based logic circuits that act as cell-type classifiers. Simultaneously, they worked on developing a delivery module, a novel E. coli bacterial strain that can identify and invade colorectal cancer cells as well as eliminate them via the transfer of their classifier. In order to quantitatively integrate safety, ethical, and societal considerations throughout the design and execution of their project, they conducted a modified 3-round policy Delphi study. Our PI joined the panel of experts by answering survey questions.
IIT_Delhi
We invited the IIT-Delhi team 2016 to guide us into iGEM for our maiden attempt. They briefed us about their past projects, technicalities, and proceedings of the competition via their five years of experience at iGEM. Informal talks were also held over tea. We extend our gratitude to them for mentoring and inspiring us through the process.
IISER Pune
This year’s National iGEM Meet was organized in and by IISER Pune on the 15th and 16th of July 2017. All the teams presented their work, shared views, and looked forward to healthy suggestions and collaborations. Even after the meet, we were exchanging ideas and suggestions throughout the preparation for iGEM.
ICT-Mumbai
ICT- Mumbai wanted us to measure the concentration of ammonia in washrooms, as well as Chemistry laboratories. They sent us the protocol but we haven’t been able to complete the work yet. We will do it as soon as possible.
Peshawar
We had frequent conversations with the Peshawar team, involving explanations of their previous model, since we were improving upon it. They also helped us in understanding the process of iGEM and the technicalities involved.
Multiple Collaborations
Our team has also collaborated with CGU_Taiwan, Hong_Kong-CUHK, IIT-Madras, Lund, NTHU_Taiwan, NU_Kazakhstan, Pasteur_Paris, TEC-Costa Rica and SVCE_CHENNAI. We set up frequent chats with them and discussed our projects. We helped each other get a better understanding of the iGEM Jamboree, and corresponded via email multiple times, answering questions about the process of competing in iGEM, apart from the various requirements for the Jamboree. We have also exchanged surveys with each other as required for our activities.
