Public Awareness
Education & Engagement
A child's mind is an unbiased and enthusiastic one, waiting eagerly for any impressions that come along. Keeping this in mind, our team has worked to inculcate the idea of reduce, reuse, and recycle in young inheritors. As part of our team's efforts to publicize science, especially about applying the concepts of synthetic biology tools towards addressing real world challenges, we organized talks and demonstrations on our institution's foundation day. We educated school and college students, showcasing applications of synthetic biology towards improving the standard of living through presentations and conducting plantation drives. We received several enthusiastic responses and returned inspired and rejuvenated by their thought provoking questions. Thus, we quote that "If a child can't learn the way we teach, then maybe we should teach the way they learn."
Student Awareness
Talk by Prof. Ram Mohan at IISER Mohali
The job of spreading awareness always starts from home. The talk was successfully organized together by BDF, Curie Club and iGEM2017 team on 08-09-2017, 09:00 PM in LH3 by Prof. Ram Mohan. The talk was accessible to all age groups.
Demonstrations
Demonstrations from all subjects were included for kindling the flame of science in students. The iGEM team also included its theme of waste management in the Biology section of demonstrations by showcasing them a bookshelf made of discarded plastic bottles.
Awareness Session in School
Awareness session for pollution control and waste management conducted by team members at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Mandi Village, New Delhi, 110047 on 23rd September 2017, 10:00 Hrs IST.
Plantation Drive
In the view of reducing pollution and at the same time keeping it an interactive social event, we carried out a tree plantation drive. It was carried out in and around the institute campus.
Interactive session with Delhi University students
We also conducted an awareness program among the Science pursuing students of Sri Venkateswara College affiliated to Delhi University.
Events and Outreach
Meeting with the iGEM IIT-Delhi team
We invited iGEM IIT-Delhi team 2016 to guide us into iGEM for the very first instance. They briefed us about their past projects, technicalities and proceedings of the competition via their five years of experience at iGEM. Informal talks were also held over tea. We extend our gratitude to them for mentoring and inspiring us through this.
National iGEM Meet
This year's National iGEM Meet was organized in and by IISER Pune on 15th and 16th July 2017. All the teams presented their work, shared views and looked forward for healthy suggestions and collaborations. Ten teams from India participated physically in the meet and one team (iGEM Peshawar from Pakistan) participated via video conference.
iBEM1.0
This year we also took part in iBEM1.0 (International Biological Engineered Machine) organized by JNU and NIPER Kolkata on March 26th to 28th. There were introductory talks on building standards and inventory of biological components, developing genome engineering tools, technologies and applications, for the neonates. Talks also focused on genome editing applications, logic gates, cell factory and synthetic life. Further, there were discussions on the core concepts, applications, future initiatives, training and employment opportunities, for the best benefit of the emerging synthetic biology community in India.
