Entrepreneurship
Our Project’s represent the best entrepreneurial qualities packed in a small E.coli smeared paper. Its humble origin, versatile use, coupled with its wide scale applicability makes it an ideal project for commercialization. The source of passion for creating a viable paper based synthetic circuit was the vision to provide a sustainable device for detection of noxious gases and chemicals, deployable with immediate effect.
Its applications in industry, commercial spaces, and in the public domain make it an ideal “One Stop Shop” device. Our goal to launch this device propelled us to file a provisional patent, whose paper work is currently underway. Our strong business case and our device’s inherent attractiveness has impressed various investors with whom we are in the process of negotiating business deals.
Furthermore, a handful of Paper-based industries are already in the initial stages of implementing our project. All in all, this project is a representation of the fact that an idea backed by a resilient team of implementers always finds a space within the heart of the international market.
Why gECO?
gEco is an “E.coli smeared paper based” pollution monitoring device. The unique circuit used and the innovative wristband design makes it an ideal alternative to all the other existing pollution measuring devices and instruments. What makes it perfect for commercial use is its low cost, ability to detect almost all pollutants, and that the fact that it could be used anywhere and everywhere.
gEco represent the best entrepreneurial qualities packed in a small E.coli smeared paper. For any industry involved in or intended to get into the production of technologies for pollution measurement and control, gEco is what they are looking for. The raw materials which are required in the initial design are ribbon, paper strips, Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium, and 0.2 micron filter which are easily available at no significant costs. This makes gEco’s production highly cost effective as compared to currently used Proton Transfer Reaction – Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) and gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID) based devices. What makes gEco even more cost effective is that it is reusable, after a measurement, only the E.coli smeared paper strip has to be replaced.
Since it’s a wristband, it’s easy to carry. This carry along feature makes on site pollution measurement and detection possible which is not the case with most other competing technologies for which samples have to be brought to the lab. The types of pollutants which gEco is able to detect and measure is also unmatched, this universality with carry along nature make gEco possible to be used almost anywhere and everywhere. The sensitivity with which gEco makes measurements is again, very good.
Another game changing feature of gEco is that it is highly user-friendly. Anyone can use it and read the measurement result as the detection is exclusively visual in nature. It’s the change in color which tells about the concentration of pollutants. We think gEco will revolutionize the way commoners think about environmental pollution as they can use it themselves, and it eliminates the necessity of specialized personnel. Hence, gEco will also be instrumental in increasing awareness about environmental pollution. Color change during detection will serve as a visual guide for them to observe pollution throughout the surroundings.
The low production cost, unique wristband design, and versatile use, coupled with its wide scale applicability and easy to use features make gEco ideal for mass industrial production and its introduction into the market.
We understand our responsibility towards the cause of environmental protection and have therefore decided not to file patents and to keep gEco technology open source. Our strong business case and our device’s inherent attractiveness have impressed various investors. Furthermore, a handful of Paper-based industries are interested in implementing our project once the device can be made. All in all, this project is a representation of the fact that an idea backed by a resilient team of implementers always finds a space within the heart of the international market.
