In an attempt to make our paper based device a perpetual sink for toxic gases and harmful chemicals, we decided to co-culture our genetically engineered E.coli with a naturally available species of algae like Heterosigma akashiwo, Chlorella vutgaris, or the microalgae (Chaetoceros gracilis) which would utilize the gases and chemicals captured as a nutrient for its own metabolic pathways. As an example, we can use specific algae species for various harmful pollutants like:
CO → Chlorella vutgaris [1]  NO, CO2 → Dunaliella tertiolecta [2]

We are attempting to create a symbiotic system by carefully choosing the species of algae, which would provide a natural way to dispose the harmful gases that are captured from the environment. Furthermore, co-culturing the E.coli with algal colonies increases the lifetime of the E.coli several fold by consuming the toxic gases. Furthermore, it will increase the applicability of our project as a viable device for the detection, capture and consumption of noxious gases and harmful chemicals.
