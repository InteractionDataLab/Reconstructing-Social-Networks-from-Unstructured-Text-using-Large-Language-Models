Composite Part:
Part no. 1
Part name- Plac->RBS->amilCP Blue chromoprotein
Part number- BBa_K2320001
Description:
AmilCP blue chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320001 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of blue colored amilCP protein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.
Part no. 2
Part name- Plac->RBS->amilGFP BBa_K592010 (yellow)
Part number- BBa_K2320002
Description:
AmilGFP yellow chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320002 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of yellow colored amilGFP protein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.
Part no. 3
Part name- Plac->RBS->amilCP Blue chromoprotein
Part number- BBa_K2320001
Description:
AmilCP blue chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320001 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of blue colored amilCP protein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.
Part no. 4
Part name- Plac->RBS->cjBlue green chromoprotein
Part number- BBa_K2320004
Description:
cjBlue green chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320004 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of greenish-blue colored chromoprotein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.
Part no. 5
Part name- Plac->RBS->eforRed chromoprotein
Part number- BBa_K2320005
Description:
eforRed chromoprotein has been cloned under IPTG inducible lac promoter and RBS. Induction of E. coli carrying K2320005 with IPTG leads to intracellular production of eforRed chromoprotein. Other teams can clone their gene of interest along with a RBS of their choice downstream of this IPTG inducible reporter. Induction with IPTG will give a real-time crude estimation of expression of their protein of interest. In addition, this construct will give an added advantage to tune the expression of their protein of interest by varying amount of IPTG or glucose.
