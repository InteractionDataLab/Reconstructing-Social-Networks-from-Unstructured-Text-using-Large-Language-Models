We seek to automate the process of reading gel doc slides and give reliable band sizes as outputs in a comprehensible format with an easy-to-use software. A manual mode has also been developed for graphical analysis to ease the detection of fainter bands that are too close to each other to distinguish using one's eyes. The software requires minimal resources: a few Python modules, any gel doc machine and a variety of standard ladders. The main difficulty in differentiating very closely spaced bands (due to the inefficiency of human eyes), is done away with in this module. Furthermore, we are working on introducing machine learning in the software to give better accuracy and to detect extremely faint bands. The software will help students and researchers to automate the mundane and routine task of reading gel doc slides.
The release 1.0.0 of the software can be found on this link: Click Here (@:https://github.com/igemsoftware2017/GelDoc-Scanner/releases/tag/1.0.0)
