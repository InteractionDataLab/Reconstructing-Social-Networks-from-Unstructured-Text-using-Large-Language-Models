Slum Awareness
With an aim of creating awareness among people, following activities were carried out by the iGEM team members:
Awareness session for pollution control and waste management conducted by team members at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Mandi Village, New Delhi, 110047 on 23rd September 2017. 10:00 Hrs.     During this session, children were told the very basic steps that can be taken at the individual level that can be taken by anyone to contribute towards pollution control and waste management. It was an event worth learning from as students too gave a few innovative ideas to deal with the environmental problems being faced by the society particularly as a part of the way onto development by countries like India.
A slum survey was done and people living there were given guidance to lead a healthy life. The details of the same are as written below :
Time and Date: 17:30 Hrs - 20:00 Hrs on 07-10-2017 and 17:30 Hrs - 19:00 Hrs on 08-10-2017   Place: Jagatpura, Beside Sector 48-C, Chandigarh (30.679218, 76.756539).   The team members met 5 families and 2 cluster joint families consisting of 6 nuclear families each. It was found that:
All of them settled temporarily and most of them had no identity proof.
People settled there were from different states - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Punjab.
No sanitary facilities were available in their settlements. All went for open defecation near the drainage that passed through the slums.
No waste disposal mechanism was provided. Large piles of plastic were seen everywhere.
Except two families that alternatively used gas, all others permanently used wood as fuel for Cooking food.
Wood, used as fuel, was mainly procured from nearby woodland and waste grounds. While some said they picked the dry, dead branches, others axed out fresh trees and dried them in their localities.
Also we were told that whenever they came to know about any clearing of forests for industrial purposes by the government, they picked up wood from there in masses.
During winters, even those who use gas, shift to wood burning as they don't want to spend their money on heaters and electricity.

Gas was filled at the rate of Rs. 50 / Kg.
Despite government distribution of free gas connection, most of them did not register and it was attributed to the lack of address proof.
On being asked about the government scheme Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, they said that the number of people using wood as fuel has fallen a lot.
It was found that nearby government toilets charged Rs. 5 for one instance and it was even unknown whether the ones collecting money are instructed to do so or not.
We told the people about the issues with using wood as fuel, about the breathing problems it can lead to in a long run and also about the pollutants released in the environment as a consequence of such practices. Also we told them about the problems with open defecation since it   Leads to mixing of toxic substances and harmful bacteria with the underground water resources.
