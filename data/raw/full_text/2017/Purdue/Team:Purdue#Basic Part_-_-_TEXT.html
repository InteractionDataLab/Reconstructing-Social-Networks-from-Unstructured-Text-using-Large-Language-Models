BnzA
Codes for a subunit of a complex that converts benzene to cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol.
Link
BnzB
Codes for a subunit of a complex that converts benzene to cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol. This subunit is responsible for substrate specificity.
Link
BnzC
Codes for a subunit of a complex that converts benzene to cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol. This is the ferredoxin subunit.
Link
BnzD
Codes for a subunit of a complex that converts benzene to cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol. This is the ferredoxin-NAD reductase subunit.
Link
CatE
Codes for cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase which catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde.
