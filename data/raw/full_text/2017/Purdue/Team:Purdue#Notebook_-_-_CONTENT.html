<B>Vi Ka:</B> Continued contacting authors for bacteria culture strains. Received responses - however due to international shipping costs and customs regulations, had to turn them down.</P><H2><FONT color="goldenrod">Wednesday, 5/24 Day 3</FONT></H2><P><B>Andrew:</B>  An updated PCR protocol update and bill of materials were assigned.  RBS’s from 41 total bacteria were run through comparative sequence analysis in order to compile a logo plot and to propose 5 possible “universal” sites.

Attended a literature search seminar for the Purdue Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) about learning vocabulary required for fully understanding the project as well as identifying papers which would be useful. Arrived late to the meeting with Dr. Rickus, but was still able to explain the two literature searches had conducted the day before. Dr. Rickus advised on some on-campus experts to contact for the lung mimicking model as well as a new method for the in-vitro enzyme activity assay using NADH fluorescence to measure its concentration. Emailed one of the team members working with decellularization whom Dr. Rickus had suggested contacting before lunch. Had a second meeting with Dr. Rickus after lunch in which SURF requirements and some other possible lung mimicking model methods were discussed.

After constructive criticism from Dr. Solomon, began searching for a constitutive promoter with a common sigma factor that I could then base the universal promoter on.
<B>Vi Ka:</B> Continued literature review on transport assays - decided to use fatty acid in our protocol instead of benzene (for now), because it is harder to quantify transport of benzene into the cell. Most protocols used radiolabeled oleic acid, however due to lab regulations we won’t be able to work with radioactive materials.</P><H2><FONT color="goldenrod">Friday, 5/26 Day 5</FONT></H2><P><B>Andrew:</B>  Literature review concerning preserving bacteria was continued, exploring whether to perform this through lyophilization or freezing in harmless compounds (like sucrose).

Conducted a literature search in order to evaluate the lung model methods. Looked into pricing for the decellularization/recellularization bioreactor creation.
<B>Kevin:</B> Began more extensive research on the promoter preceding the atpI gene, including looking at conserved regions of its predicted promoter sequence amongst different species of bacteria. Of these bacteria, there was a consensus region of approximately 30bp. Using the relative frequency of base pairs from a weblogo plot as well as a random number generator, 20 possible new universal promoters were designed. All promoter sequences were run through a promoter predictor algorithm and the 12 that were recognized and given a score progressed to the final test. From these 12 promoter sequences, 5 were chosen based on their scores and how conserved  the -10 and -35 consensus regions were.
