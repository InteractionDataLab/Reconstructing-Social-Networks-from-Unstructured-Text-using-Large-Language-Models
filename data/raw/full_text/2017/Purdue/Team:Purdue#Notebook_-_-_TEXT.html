Kevin: Continued work on universal promoter by finding consensus between Pbad promoter on E. coli and other organisms.
Vi Ka: Continued contacting authors for bacteria culture strains. Received responses - however due to international shipping costs and customs regulations, had to turn them down.
Wednesday, 5/24 Day 3
Andrew: An updated PCR protocol update and bill of materials were assigned.  RBS’s from 41 total bacteria were run through comparative sequence analysis in order to compile a logo plot and to propose 5 possible “universal” sites.  Through literature review, a mathematical model for transcription rates was found along with software that applies this model to given sequences.

Caleigh: Organized agenda for today’s meeting with the advisor Dr. Rickus and the presentation for tomorrow’s meeting with the advisor with Dr. Solomon. Safety review for future project plans.
Katie: Prepared slides for a meeting with our PI, Dr. Rickus. Attended a literature search seminar for the Purdue Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) about learning vocabulary required for fully understanding the project as well as identifying papers which would be useful. Arrived late to the meeting with Dr. Rickus, but was still able to explain the two literature searches had conducted the day before. Dr. Rickus advised on some on-campus experts to contact for the lung mimicking model as well as a new method for the in-vitro enzyme activity assay using NADH fluorescence to measure its concentration. Emailed one of the team members working with decellularization whom Dr. Rickus had suggested contacting before lunch. Had a second meeting with Dr. Rickus after lunch in which SURF requirements and some other possible lung mimicking model methods were discussed. Continued the literature search and edited meeting slides with the new information that was received for the next day’s meeting with Dr. Solomon. At the end of the day, prepared LB broth and LB + agar with antibiotics for plating.

Continued writing the in-vitro enzyme activity assay. Had meeting with Dr. Solomon and began further research on both topics presented after receiving his advice.
Kevin: Continued research on substance toxicity and cell viability. Began research on how to quantify nahK protein activity. Reframed quantification of benzene, toluene, and xylene protocols on a different piece of literature. After constructive criticism from Dr. Solomon, began searching for a constitutive promoter with a common sigma factor that I could then base the universal promoter on.
Vi Ka: Continued literature review on transport assays - decided to use fatty acid in our protocol instead of benzene (for now), because it is harder to quantify transport of benzene into the cell. Most protocols used radiolabeled oleic acid, however due to lab regulations we won’t be able to work with radioactive materials.
Friday, 5/26 Day 5
Andrew: Literature review concerning preserving bacteria was continued, exploring whether to perform this through lyophilization or freezing in harmless compounds (like sucrose).  Vacuum drying was researched as another possible method.  A final method was decided which included freeze-drying bacteria with sucrose and skim milk powder at various temperatures.
Caleigh: Attended a meeting to discuss our use of Bindley Metabolite Profiling Center equipment. Created gBlocks from the universal ribosome binding sites designed by Andrew to allow for efficient use of the gBlocks in several constructs and assays and Gibson assembly.
Katie: Finished the enzyme assay bill of materials for Archana. Attended a meeting with Dr. Sors and took note of other on-campus experts to contact about the enzyme assays and the lung model. Wrote the Relay for Life post for the Wiki, relating to the team’s public engagement that had been executed in the spring. Made a graphic for the Relay for Life post.
Kevin: Found a sigma-70 constitutive promoter for the atpI gene in E. coli that should prove effective as a basis for the universal promoter. Met with Bruce Cooper from Metabolite Processing Center about use of his gas chromatograph and received approval of benzene, toluene, and xylene quantification protocols. Decided that xylene effects poses no serious health effects and should therefore not be tested. Wiki work!
Archana: Continued contacting company representatives. Began intern payroll process. Continued researching corporate funding opportunities.
