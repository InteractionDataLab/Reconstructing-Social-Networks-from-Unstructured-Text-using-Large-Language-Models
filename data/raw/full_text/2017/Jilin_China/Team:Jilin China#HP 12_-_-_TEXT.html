In August 1st, we went to Tianjin Province in China and attended the conference held together with other four teams (NKU_China, Tianjin, NPU_China and TUST_China). In the morning, we visited the laboratory of NKU_China and we presented our project in the afternoon. After presentation, we discussed the projects heatedly and many novel ideas were inspired from this conference. Mingzhe Han from team Tianjin pointed out some shortcomings of our TA system, which helped us a lot to improve our project. Besides, we helped TUST_China to solve some problems in bacteria culturing.
