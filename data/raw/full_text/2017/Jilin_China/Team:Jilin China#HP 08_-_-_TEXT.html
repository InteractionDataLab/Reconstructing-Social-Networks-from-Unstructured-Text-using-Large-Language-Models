In October 10th, we held a campus talk in Jingxin Teaching Building for Jilin_China team and iGEM, aiming at recruiting undergraduate students, especially for students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, software and math. Through this talk, we introduced synthetic biology, iGEM and some best projects from previous competitions. During the talk, we invited our instructor, Dr. Ali Hou, to hold a speech and previous team members to share their experiences. We also answered their questions. About 300 students participated in this talk and all of them were very enthusiastic towards synthetic biology. We had a heated discussion after the talk.
