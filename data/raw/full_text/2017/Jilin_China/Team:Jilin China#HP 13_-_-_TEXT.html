CCiC
In August 26th, with the invitation from Fujian Agriculture and Forest University, we attended 2017 Conference of China iGEMer Community(CCiC) in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. Zihao Wang and Xiaolin Dong did the presentation. Huadong Xing designed the poster, Jin Liu and Zhongqiao Gan introduced the posters to others. Hongmin Yu was in charge of the conference recording. During the conference, many famous synthetic biologists, such as Prof. Chunbo Lou from Chinese Academy of Science, Prof. Luping Xu from Tsinghua University, Dr. Haoqian Zhang and Dr. Teng Li from Bluepha, etc., did their lectures. A face-to-face discussion with iGEM HQ was also held.
In this conference, we communicated with other teams about the design of the projects and problems we met during the experiments. We learned a lot from other teams and established good relationship with them. Our good performance was approved by professors attending the conference, and we received many suggestions from them.
