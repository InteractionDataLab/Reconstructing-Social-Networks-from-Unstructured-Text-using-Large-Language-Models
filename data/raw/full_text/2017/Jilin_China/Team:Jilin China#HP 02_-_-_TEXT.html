Survey
From our brainstorm meetings, we wanted to apply our TA system into some environment issues. However, we couldn't decide which kind of pollution could be worked on. So we wanted to gather some information from the public. Maybe our project could solve some main concerns of the public.
We handed out the questionnaires on May 15th. We wanted to get as much as information from the survey. Among the 198 interviewees aging 18-30  who were not involved in the environment-related career, most people thought that the major and most urgent types of pollution were water pollution and air pollution. In addition, our diary life was affected mostly by water and air pollution.
According to the results, we held the group meeting and determined that our TA system should be used in the treatment of water pollution.
According to the results of the first survey and the group meeting after that, we aimed to apply our TA system tp the treatment of water pollution. We learned that domestic sewage and industrial sewage were the two main types of water pollutants. However, the contents are so complex (such as organophosphorus, heavy metal, COD and phenol, etc.) and we couldn't determine to focus on which certain pollutant. Therefore, we carried out another survey.
This time, the sample size was 200. According to the results, about 72% of the people held the belief that the condition of industrial sewage was the most severe, and 66% of the people thought that it affected a lot to the water quality. Besides, we also wondered public attitudes towards water treatment with genetically engineered bacteria. Over 80% people thought that bacteria could be used only in conditions that the safety can be guaranteed. From this survey we know the significance of biosafety and the promising prospect of Geneguard system.
After discussion, we chose to focus on industrial sewage in our project.
