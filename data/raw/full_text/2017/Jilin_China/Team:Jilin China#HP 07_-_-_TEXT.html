Elite Program
From July 20th to August 1st, we welcomed some talented middle school students to visit our lab. They were all involved in the Elite Program organized by Chinese government. Since they were passionate for biology researches and their school also wanted to organize their own iGEM team in the future, they came to our lab to take a bite about researches and obtain experiences from us. Jin Liu and Zihao Wang from our team companied with them through their twelve-day laboratory life. We introduced synthetic biology and our project to them and helped them to finish some simple biology experiments.
During this period, we educated them with the regulations of the lab to ensure their safety. After 12 days of studying, the students sent us emails to show their gratefulness and cheer for us as well.
