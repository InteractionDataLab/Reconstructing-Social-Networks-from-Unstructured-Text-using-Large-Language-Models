Interview
in the institute
We also interviewed professors from the research institute of Jilin Petrochemical Company on May 25th to learn about their work on water treatment and we found that phenolic compounds can be the problems and using bacteria for the degradation of pollutants is better than other methods. Our interview was recorded as follows.
Q: Where does sewage that sewage treatment plant accepts come from? Which type of pollutant contained the most?
A: The sewage mainly comes from different factories in Jilin petrochemical company, treated by factories themselves first. Then it was treated by AO methods (anaerobic & oxic method). Pollutants have almost the same composition, including benzene, phenol and acetone.
Q: Which kind of factory produces benzene and phenol the most?
A: Mainly from oil refinery factories. Sewage in dye processing plants contains phenol, but compared to other factories, it has less pollution.
Q: What's the main work of the research institute?
A: We mainly serve for the company. The equipment for sewage disposing are built by factories themselves. When the sewage doesn't meet the standard, institute provides some optimization. For factories discharging high pollutants contents, we will set point source processing unit. Pollutants hard to be delt with will be sent to institute for study and we will find ways for disposing.
Q: What are the main ways of dealing with pollutants?
A: Dealing methods contains chemical methods, physical methods and biochemical methods. Chemical methods mean that medicament is added into the sewage. Physical methods mainly use compression filter for separation. Biochemical methods, which mainly use microorganism for degradation. Biochemical methods are the most economical and efficient ways. Using biochemical methods every hour can deal with 1100 tons of sewage, and COD can be reduced by more than 85%. Different factories have different methods of dealing pollutants.
