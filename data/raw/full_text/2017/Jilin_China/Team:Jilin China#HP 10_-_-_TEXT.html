Social network platform
Through social network platforms such as WeChat and Facebook, we recorded our ongoing events and shared our experience in the competition. Besides, we used these platforms to interact with other iGEM groups and synthetic biologists, which could help us maintain good relationship with others.
Also, one of the most important purposes was to educate public. By posting some easily-understood knowledge about synthetic biology, iGEM competition and our project, we hoped more people can learn about the severity of water pollution and the usage of bacteria in various ways. We also received supports and suggestions from others through these platforms. The QR code of our WeChat social platform is shown. Come and follow us to make the water and the world better!
