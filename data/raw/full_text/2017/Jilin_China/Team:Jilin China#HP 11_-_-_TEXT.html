With the aim of the publicity of the sources and the damage of water pollution, we made some leaflets, along with the leaflets on some basic information about biosafety issues. By handing out all these leaflets in crowded such as Walmart and KFC in Changchun, we wanted to increase public engagement towards environmental problems and showed people with some basic knowledge about synthetic biology. We appreciated staff from Walmart and KFC for their assistance.
