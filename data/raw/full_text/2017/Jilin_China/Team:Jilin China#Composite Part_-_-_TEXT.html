Composite Parts
TA - DmpR - TfdB-JLU
The function of the composite part we have been working on is to detect and degrade chlorophenol under population control of Geneguard system.
Figure 1: The TA - DmpR - TfdB-JLU construct
This part is a combination of our Geneguard system and chlorophenol response system. Part BBa_J23107 is a constitutive promoter which could provide a constitutive expression of sensor DmpR and toxin CbtA.
This DmpR in our device is a mutant type based on the wild type DmpR used by 2013 Peking( BBa_K1031211 ) and showed more efficient and wider substrate range than wild type.
Toxin CbtA could keep the growth of the engineered bacteria in a low level. When exposed to contaminants, complex of DmpR and chlorophenol could bind to promoter Po and initiate the expression of antitoxin CbeA as well as TfdB-JLU, a monooxygenase that is responsible for initial hydroxylation of the benzene ring[1-2].
