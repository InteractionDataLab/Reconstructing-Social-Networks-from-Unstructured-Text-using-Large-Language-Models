Interview
in the factory
Firstly, we wanted to interview some factories that may produce various kind of pollutants. Our instructors offered us a chance to interview Jilin Petrochemical Company, which has the biggest petrochemical factory in Jilin Province. We wanted to get information about some main pollutants. So we interviewed them in May 22nd.
At that day, we visited the advanced sewage treatment equipment in the factory and got to know the general disposing procedure, then we did an interview to the directors of some departments. The interview was about water quality, technical issues and team project consulting. At the same time, professors from the company gave us some useful suggestions and opinions to our project. The questions we asked and the answers given by professors are shown as follows.
Q: Which type of pollutant was discharged the most in your factory? What's the standard of dealing with it?
A: Phenol is our raw material and the most abundant pollutant in sewage we discharge. When discharging, we would test COD. If COD exceeds 2000, the sewage would be put into a buffer pool and most phenol will be recycled by the membrane system. When COD reduces to 1900-2000, sewage would be discharged into sewage disposal plant through pipes for further disposal.
Q: Have the situation of pollutant leakage ever happened? How do you deal with it?
A: Not really. In case of emergency, we put VOC monitoring system in many spots. Safety and environmental protection department can monitor them in real time. If any leakage happens, the department can tell where it is and repair the leakage.
Q: What kind of pollutant does your factory have the most? How do you deal with it?
A: The majorities are water, gas and raw slag. The major pollutant in water is phenol. Some flue gas will be produced during phenol sewage disposal. We use cooling circuit system to get rid of most flue gas, making total amount of hydrogen below 0.05. At present, point source processing is used for fixed-point processing. Technology nowadays is far more advanced than that in the past, and COD of emissions is lower from 50 thousand to 2 thousand. Benzene is also reduced to 0.04 from 4. What’s more, dealing methods is transformed from direct drainage to circulating. Not only do we save raw materials, but also reduce pollutants.
