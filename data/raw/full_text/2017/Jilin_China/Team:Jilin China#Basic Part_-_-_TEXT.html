1.wt-Pr
wt-Pr is a constitutive promoter which is in the upstream of DmpR, a transcriptional factor of dmp operon from Pseudomonas sp. Strain CF600 encoded by dmpR gene[1].
2.cphA-1
CphA-1, a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6, is responsible for ring cleavage in aromatic compounds degrading process [2].
Figure 2. Reaction of cphA-1
3.CaO19
CaO19, a hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase from Candida albicans TL3, is responsible for ring cleavage in aromatic compounds degrading process[3].

4.CbtA (toxin)
CbtA is a protein found in crytic prophage CP4-44 in Escherichia coli K-12. CbtA could inhibit cell division and cell elongation via direct and independent interactions with FtsZ and MreB[4], so it is defined as a kind of toxin.
5.CbeA (antitoxin)
CbeA is a protein found in crytic prophage CP4-44 in Escherichia coli K-12 which could suppress the effect of CbtA, so it is defined as a kind of antitoxin. Instead of interacting with CbtA, CbeA directly binds MreB and FtsZ and promotes the assembly of FtsZ and MreB filaments[4].
Figure 4. TA system
This year we use CbtA and CbeA to build the Geneguard system in our project. For detailed information about toxin/antitoxin (TA) system, please visit ...
6.DmpR
DmpR is a σ54-dependent transcriptional factor of dmp operon from Pseudomonas sp. Strain CF600.[5] Transcription of Po, promoter of dmp operon, is activated when DmpR detects the presence of certain phenol compounds.[5-6] DmpR directly interacts with proper inducers at its effector-sensing domain, and the effector-sensor compound then binds to Po promoter and downstream transcription is initiated. The DmpR we use is based on the wild type DmpR used by 2013 Peking ( BBa_K1031211 ) but has 5 sites of nucleotides mutation[7] of which two are nonsense mutation and others lead to two amino acids change. The mutant type shows high efficiency of transcription initiation .

7.TfdB-JLU
TfdB-JLU is a novel 2,4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase whose amino acid sequence exhibits less than 48% homology with other known TfdBs. The rate-limited step of phenolic degradation is the ortho hydroxylation[8]. Compared to wild-type TfdB, TfdB-JLU has a wilder substrate range and higher catalysis activity. Thus, the enzyme has advantages in efficient disposing of phenolic effluents[8].
