Primary School
In the noon of October 18, 2017, our team members Zihao Wang, Hongmin Yu, Nina Ma, Yu Huang, Ying Wei and Shan Wang went to Xi'an Primary School in Changchun and gave students a small speech about sewage.
We taught them how to tell different kinds of sewage and ways of disposing them. What’s more, we introduced our project design to them. After listening to the introduction from Nina Ma and watching a movie about organisms in water, children in the class were active and discussed heatedly about it. Also, they showed great interests in the device we brought to display mechanism of handling sewage. That day, we felt their curiosity and their passion towards scientific experiments.
It was an educational talk, which can help the children to better understand the severity of water pollution and methods of treatment. Their interests towards microbes and synthetic biology were also inspired from our talk.
