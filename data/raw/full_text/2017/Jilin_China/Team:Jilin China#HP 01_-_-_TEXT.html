Brainstorm
We started to discuss the topic of our project on March 1st. During this period, we held up many brainstorm meetings to work out the best project to focus on. We read a lot of paper to validate the feasibility of the projects proposed. Though it took much time, we proposed more than ten projects that we could choose to work on.
Huadong Xing and Zihan Lu put forward proposals about pet dogs in heat period and dystocia.
Nina Ma came up with an idea of fixing enamel and odontolith.
Zhongqiao Gan proposed lots of projects, including the Geneguard system that we used at last.
Letian Bao tried to establish a method on tumor targeting.  He also proposed the idea of disposing of phenol and chlorophenol.
Zihao Wang put forward proposals about Arthritis and Cytokine repair.
Ming Han attempted to establish a method of solving problem in Scar repair.
Hongmin Yu tried to apply QS system and Second messengers.
