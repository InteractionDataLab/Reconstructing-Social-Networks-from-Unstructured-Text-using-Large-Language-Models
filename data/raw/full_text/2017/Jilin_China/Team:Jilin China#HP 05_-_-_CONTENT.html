We wanted to get some information from the monitoring agencies to make sure which kind of pollutant may cause the biggest problem. And we further confirmed that finding new methods for phenol degradation is valuable.</P><P>Firstly, we looked over the advanced equipment in the inspection department and got to know general detection procedure. Then we did an interview on directors of corresponding department. </P><P>Q: According to the water quality test, is phenol pollution serious? What's the source of pollution?</P><P>A: The pollution exists in Jilin Province. In water quality test, we mainly test volatile phenol. Since Changchun has few factories to discharge volatile phenol into water, the condition is not that severe. However, in other provinces, especially that with many paper mills or printing mills, the problem can be very severe. Sanitary sewage discharging, by contrast, is the main pollution source in Changchun. Main substances that exceed the national standard are COD and ammonia nitrogen.</P><P>Q: Can you give us a brief introduction of the water monitoring process from sampling to testing?</P><P>A: Firstly, the sampling department take water samples from a fixed place. The sampling methods are based on different testing standards. Samples are handled according to different technical manuals. Analysis department does several tests on the water samples. Finally, the experimental data will be gathered. Every department runs in line with relevant regulations.</P><P>Q: How to test volatile phenol at present?</P><P>A: All the detecting methods are chemical detecting methods based on spectral theory. They went through titration in the past to conventional artificial measurement. However, we can now use the advanced instrument, flow injection analyzer to do the automatic operation and accomplish the whole measurement procedure. Compared to conventional methods, instrument flow injection analyzer has the advantages of less loss in pre-distilling, more controllable on system error, good reproducibility and veracity, though the cost is a little bit high.
        </P><P>Q: Is there any biosensor used in water quality test? What's the effect of it?</P><P>A: We used BOD rapid tester once. It has edge on testing quickly and many of its index have become national standard. But, it uses biological membrane, so it has a high request of sample quality. Excessive heavy metal ion concentration and pH will have toxicity on microorganism. What’s more, it has disadvantages on low reproducibility, low accuracy and low limit of detection.</P><P>Q: If we want to use the engineered bacteria in disposing sewage, is there any legal restraint of related laws? Do you have any suggestion?</P><P>A: Now, there is no clear law on this situation, and the effect on environment by this microorganism can be amplified gradually. In other words, latency is the main concern. River can flow through a vast area, so it may have a board effect zone. On condition that the modified microorganism is controlled, you may do small-scale simulation, then you can do practical operation based on related laws.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
