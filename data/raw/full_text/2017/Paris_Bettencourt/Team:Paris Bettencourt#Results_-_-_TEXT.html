RESULTS
Optogenetic
Membrane photosensor
PHA production under two light AND-gate.
Characterisation of slow growth in multi-plasmid system.
Chacterisation of AND-gate using transmembrane photoreceptors.
Optics
Results confirm the feasibility of achieving a high targeting resolution at significant length within the gel medium.
Biomaterial
Calcium Carbonate
Coral acid-rich proteins(CARP1-CARP4) were implemented into the expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21.
Right size proteins were expressed and checked for calcium carbonate precipitation ability.
Polysilicate
Characterized a biobrick from iGEM Pasteur
PHA
Improved the characterization of part BBa_K1149051 using flow cytometry to better quantify P3HB production in E. coli.
RNA organelle
RNA organelle was shown to decrease background expression of GFP, giving evidence to our model.
The RNA organelle was long-living, as it was observed to irreversible and stable in culture 20h after induction.
Logic Gate & Photo-Caging
Successful testing in cell-free system with Dronpa.
Found evidence that Dronpa "sticks" the repressors to DNA.
Human Practice
Collected feedback from Makerspace and Fablabs to improve our product design.
Assessed the safety measures of 3D bio-printing through interviews with specialists.
Built an Escape Room game to teach a general audience about synthetic biology and safety issues
