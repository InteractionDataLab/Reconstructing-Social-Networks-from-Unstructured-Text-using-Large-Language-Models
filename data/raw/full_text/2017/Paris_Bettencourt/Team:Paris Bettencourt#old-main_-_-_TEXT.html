BRINGING CONTROL TO THETHIRD DIMENSION
By creating logic circuits with photo sensitive proteins, we control and study cells in 3D.
Proof of concept - 3D printer: by creating a printer, it is a clear and easily quantified way to validate our 3D controls.      It also allowed us to engineer biomaterials that would be compatible and useful in      biotech. We also optimised production by creating local concnetrations of enzymes in      the RNA organelles.
