PART COLLECTION
Part Collection
The parts in this collection were designed to form either AND or NOR gates depending on light inputs. Photo-switchable proteins that alternate between homodimer and monomer conformations under specific wavelengths were designed to flank a protein of interest. This creates a protein cage, sterically repressing activity when no light is applied. Inserting either the T7 RNA polymerase or one of three repressors - TetR, HKcI and P22c2 (Parts BBa_K2510100 to BBa_K2510113) - gave us a number of photo-switchable transcription factors. To create logic, we combined such proteins with our library of 12 dually repressible promoters (Parts: BBa_K2510018 to BBa_K2510029), consisting of a single T7 promoter core and two synthetic orthogonal operators. For the first time, we are able to reversibly control gene expression at a high spatio-temporal resolution with easy procedures and minimal cost to the cell.
