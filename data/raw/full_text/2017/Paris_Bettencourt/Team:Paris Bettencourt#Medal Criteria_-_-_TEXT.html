MEDAL CRITERIA
We registered to iGEM and attended the Giant Jamboree. We also had an amazing summer :)
We met all the deliverables on time.
Our attributions page can be found here . The work of each team member is specified as well as the help we received from advisors and other researchers.
We improved the characterization of part BBa_K1149051 using flow cytometry to better quantify P3HB production in E. coli.
We validated a part that is central to our project: BBa_K2510000 . This part allows for the precipitation of CaCO3 in E. coli.
We collaborated with multiple teams, both in France and the rest of the world and made many friends. The list can be found here .
We thought about the concept and application of our project by conducting interviews with specialists in fundamental research to understand the interest for our 3D control technology as well as with heads of Fablabs for the 3D printing. You can find more information here .
You can find here how we integrated the comments and remarks of professionals as well as our market research into the project design.
We improved previous parts for our own project. Specifically, we improved the function of BBa_K1740000 , a Dronpa fluorescent protein (see here for our results).
We modeled three aspects of our project: the behavior of the RNA organelle, the promoter logic circuit and the way different gel concentrations impact laser penetration in the gel.
