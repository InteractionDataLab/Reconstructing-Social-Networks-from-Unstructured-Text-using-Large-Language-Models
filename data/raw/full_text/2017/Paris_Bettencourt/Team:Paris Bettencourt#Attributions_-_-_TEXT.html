ATTRIBUTIONS
Work performed by the team
The students came up with and developed the idea during brainstorming sessions in the firsts months of the competition, letting the project evolve throughout the summer. All of the designs, constructs and experiments were performed by the students of the 2017 Paris Bettencourt team.
Instructors and Advisors provided support, advice and feedback when needed. The team was hosted by the CRI lab inside of the Paris-Descartes University. If more than one person is listed, we highlighted the main person responsible

MENTORS & ADVISORS
Special thanks to
Haotian GuoFor always being there to help and support us. He was crucial to the experimental design of the project, helped us troubleshoot, analyze the results and everything else. He was always available for advice.Prateek Garg & Sophie GontierFor providing their expertise with the competition, having done iGEM before, and Sophie for helping us with the human practices.
Alvaro Banderas, PhDFor his scientific and also emotional support through this experience. He also helped us look at the big picture when we were focused on smaller details and single experiments.Mourdjen BariFor helping us with the human practices and the wiki, and being willing to lend your time to help move our project forward.
Ariel Lindner, PhDFor lending us your expertise to help devise a strategy for a successful project. He also provided the network to allow us to develop our project to the fullest.Jake Wintermute, PhDFor providing input using his experience coaching 5 different iGEM teams. His input was vital for our better understanding of the structure of the competition.
Project support and advice
Jean Krivine, Jerôme Feret, Grégory Batt & Damien WoodsFor their help with our different modelling approaches.
