We are happy to announce many great sponsors for the iGEM Team Stuttgart 2017 this year.                We are grateful for everyone that supported us with financing, materials and counsel.                Without all of you our project and aims wouldnâ€™t have been possible to accomplish.                A huge thank you for your trust and your support to all of you.
