what are you studying: Technical Biology (M. Sc.)
your iGEM tasks: Modeling and Simulation, Website, Wiki
what do you like about iGEM/synthetic biology? I really like about iGEM, that it provides the framework to find and develop own scientific ideas, even if this does not necessarily lead to a finished product.
what did iGEM teach you for life? How to successfully deal with obstacles in your way when you are the first paving that way.

name and age: Amatus, 25
what are you studying: Technical Biology (M. Sc.)
your iGEM tasks: Modeling
what do you like about iGEM/synthetic biology? I like the aspect to follow a project from beginning to end. I think synthetic biology is capable to provide solutions to a lot of today’s problems.
what did iGEM teach you for life? Not that much, so far ...
other Interests: Computers in general, playing instruments (violin, piano, guitar, ...) and watching series.

Elke
Elke belongs to the wetlab team and is in charge of the visual layout and content of this wiki.
name and age: Elke Evgrafov, 29
what are you studying: Technical Biology (M. Sc.)
your iGEM tasks: My focus in this project is the production of a charming rose-scent with the help of E.coli, and the visual layout and content of this wiki.
what do you like about iGEM/synthetic biology? iGEM offers you the opportunity to develop and learn to work in a team towards one goal.                     My motivation at the project is the independent work in the laboratory on a self-imposed topic                      and the gathering of new experiences that go beyond the university everyday life.
what did iGEM teach you for life? Everything that belongs to an independent project, such as project development, -funding (sponsorship),-organization, laboratory work,... AND HTML :-)
other Interests: Diving, reading, sports
Nici
Nici is our team's crazy lady organizing everything be it Sponsorship, Human Practices, Interviews,... and of course fun activities for our team!
name and age: Nicole Buss, 25
what are you studying: Technical Biology (M. Sc.)
your iGEM tasks: Wetlab (keratinases), sponsoring, human practices and marketing
what do you like about iGEM/synthetic biology? The iGEM competition provides groups of students with the opportunity to establish their own scientific project from scratch and to create something completely new in an interdisciplinary and international environment. It’s a great chance to look behind the scenes what synthetic biology can offer and what will be possible in the nearby future.
what did iGEM teach you for life? Endurance, and that humor is all you need... that Youtube videos are a scientists best friend, that everything is feasible if you do it with the right people, that almost nothing can harm E.coli and that not everything is suitable for microwaves ...
other Interests: Sports, traveling, going on adventures, spreading love and joy...
Cati
Cati is part of the sponsoring and wetlab team.
what are you studying: Technical Biology (M. Sc.)
your iGEM tasks: mostly sponsoring, lab works (esterases and signal peptides) and human practices, but there is no strict assignment of tasks
what do you like about iGEM/synthetic biology? I like the fact that iGEM is a competition but nevertheless people are working together instead of against each other. It’s more important to achieve scientific and personal progress than winning a prize.
what did iGEM teach you for life? If you ask people for help, you can receive help. A few months ago I did not think that I would speak to so many people in so little time, receiving so much support.
