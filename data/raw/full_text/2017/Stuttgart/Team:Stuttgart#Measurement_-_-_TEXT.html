Measurement
In our project we measured the enzyme activity of the supernatant of the cells.    To determine the esterase activity we used biological and technical triplicates.    The gene expression was induced with different induction levels and the enzyme activity was calculated from different substrate concentrations.    The protocols you may find on: Protocols and Experiments ,    the results you may find on: Results Esterase .
