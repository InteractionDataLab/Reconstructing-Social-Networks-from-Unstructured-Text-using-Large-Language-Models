Being the first iGEM Team of the University Stuttgart we are proud to say that we fulfilled all the requirements to gain the bronze medal!            We were able to submit our first biobrick to the iGEM registry and showed good lab results by prooving succesful activity of our enzymes.            We fulfilled the human practices criteria by talking to different experts, doing student counseling and by participating at different scientific conferences.            We collaborated with different iGEM Teams such as Tübingen, Cologne-Düsseldorf, Heidelberg and Canmore and we raised awarness of our project in the public.            We are excited for all the iGEM Teams Stuttgart that will step into our shoes and we wish great success with their future projects.
