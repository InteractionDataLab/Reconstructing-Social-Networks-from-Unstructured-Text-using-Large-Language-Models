Transformation of three promotors: BBa_J23102, BBa_J2314 and BB-K206000 again into Zymo Research Competent mix and go cells this time, after nothing grew on the agar plates
To add our keratinase genes with promotors we transformed BBa_J23115, BBa_J23119 and an inducible pBAD promotor BBa_K206000 and cut cleaned up plasmids with EcoR1 and Spe1 for Standard Assembly.       After digest with second enzyme, for J23115 and J23119 only plasmid backbones were detected.        In lines of K206000 two fragments were detected, as expected (insert and backbone) (figure ).
