Determination of DNA concentration
DNA concentration is determined by using a Nanodrop ()
The absorbance at 260 nm is converted to concentration using the Lambert – Beer Equation by the program
The purity of the sample is confirmed by the 260/280 ratio (contamination with proteins) and the 260/230 ratio (presence of co-purified contaminants)
For pure DNA the 260/280 ratio should be around 1.8 and the 260/280 ratio should be around 1.8 – 2.2. (ND-1000-v3.4-users-manual, Thermo Scientific)

Semi-quantitative hair degradation assay for keratinases
To prove any enzyme activity a semi-quantitative hair degradation assay was performed. First, cultures of E. coli containing kerA, kerUS, kerP plasmid and one wild-type E. coli were grown at 37°C in sterile LB broth. Chloramphenicol (final concentration 35 µg/mL) was added to the cultures containing kerA and kerUS. Kanamycin (final concentration 50 µg/mL) was added to the cultures containing the kerP. After incubation OD600 was measured before inducing cultures containing kerA and kerUS with IPTG with a final concentration of 1mM. Human hair was reduced to smaller pieces and then dried for 1 hour at 65°C. Afterwards the hair was distributed in 0.05 g aliquots and the full amount of each culture was added.  The cultures + hair were incubated 120 hours at 37°C with slightly shaking.
Skim milk plate assay for keratinases
This assay was performed to show qualitative enzyme activity.  The different keratinases (kerA, kerUS and kerP) should degrade the casein in the milk, seen as clear zones around the cultures itself or the supernatant of the cells.
Preparation of skim milk plates:
First 100 mL LB/agar and 5 g skim milk powder in 125 mL distilled water was prepared. Both solutions were autoclaved and mixed after cooling down.  For the plates used for kerA and kerUS cultures chloramphenicol (35 µg/mL) was added – in case of kerP kanamycin (50 µg/mL) was used to prepare plates.  The plates were poured and stored at 4°C.
Assay:
kerA/kerUS: Before spreading both keratinases on the plates, cells were induced with 1mM IPTG o/n at 37°C.    After incubation 10 µL of the induced cell cultures and supernatant, cell culture without IPTG induction and a wild-type E. coli control was spread on skim milk plates containing chloramphenicol.    The plates were incubated at room temperature for four days.
kerP: 10 µL of cell culture, supernatant and a wild-type E. coli control was spread on skim milk plates containing kanamycin.    The plates were incubated at room temperature for four days.
