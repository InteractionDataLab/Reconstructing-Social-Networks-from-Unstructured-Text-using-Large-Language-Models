But we were welcomed so friendly! Everone gave us good advice, shared their experiences with sponsors, iGEM itself or solving experimental problems. 
We met a few german teams to exchange information and to just have a good time with each other. All in all it was a very valuable experience to us. 
So – big thanks to all iGEM-Teams for the support and helpful hints. It made the start much more easier and we are happy to be part of that great iGEM-community now.

As they were the first iGEM Team of their University in 2016 they knew excactly what problems we faced. 
Not only taking us by the hand and giving us great support and advices during the whole time, they also invited us to their

This is a very fast method to insert a desired mutation into bacterial cells. In their case, they used the method to evolve three mutagenesis plasmids developing different antibiotic resistances in E. coli cells. We were asked to perform a mutagenesis plasmid activity assay to analyze their function and mutagenesis levels. In return they supported us developing our biosafety part.(see <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Stuttgart/Safety">safety</A>). 
All in all Team Heidelberg gave us continuous support and we are very thankful for that.

  We had a nice barbecue and after being filled up with great food the Tübinger Team invited us to discover one of the highlights of the city - the famous Stocherkahn (sorry - I have no translation for this!) on the Neckar river! 
  We had lots of fun, laughter and a great time getting a lot of input, information and experienced advices for the iGEM competition! 
  As the iGEM Team Tübingen is already an succesful expert in the complete iGEM concept since years - we newbies ;) - were lucky to get so many passionated and ambitious help! 
  It's nice to see that iGEM is a competition where you meet so many great people that want to help each other out! 
  Thank you Team Tübingen and we hopefully can give you back your hospitality soon!

We saw that the iGEM Team of Canmore 2016 was able to submit two composite parts to the registry. These parts consist of a protein coding sequence for the KerUS gene and an IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_K1717173) and the KerA gene with an IPTG-inducible promoter (BBa_K1717000). Given the fact that we were not able to obtain these parts from the iGEM registry we were in contact with the iGEM Team Canmore and one of their mentors Lisa Oberding from FREDsense who shipped us the required parts from Canada to Germany. Thanks to their former experiences with these two keratinases and already faced issues going along with them, we were able to avoid some troubleshootings.</P><UL><LI>iGEM-Team Canmore 2016 check out their wiki <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Team:OLS_Canmore">page</A> for more information </LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
