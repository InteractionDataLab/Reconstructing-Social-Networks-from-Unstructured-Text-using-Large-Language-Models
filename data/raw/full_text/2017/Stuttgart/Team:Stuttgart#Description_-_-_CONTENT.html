You want to enjoy a refreshing shower in the morning, but your hairy roommate clogged the drain again? 
You would like to have a relaxed bubble bath after a long day, but there are bad odors coming out of the pipe system?

The general practice now:
<UL><LI>You try the ‘hot water method’ to flush the drain…  nothing happens.</LI><LI>You remember what your mother taught you, so you put a fancy mix of vinegar, baking soda and some magic into the drain… a mysterious creature arises, but nothing else happens.</LI><LI>In the end there is just one thing left – you put the nasty chemical mixture of the stinky cleaning agent down the drain. The corrosive cloud disappears and you can finally take your shower… still trying not to breath in the acrid fumes.</LI></UL></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"><P>Pipe clogging and closure occurs in every household as well as in industry. 
        Various components contribute to the pipe closure, such as fat and hair. 
        Commercial chemical pipe cleaners contain aggressive substances, which are harmful to the environment and health and also can lead to pipe breaks. 
        Biological alternatives (purified enzymes) have been researched for years, without reaching the efficiency of chemical cleaners. 
        In addition, the purification of the enzymes is very complex and cost intensive. </P><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"><H3>Our solution</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"><P>We pursue a system-biological solution which is based on an intact microbial system. 
        Inspired by different interesting projects we decided to develope a keranolytic <I>Escherichia coli</I>. 
        The projects of past iGEM-teams were part of our investigation too and we are already co-working with iGEM-team OLS_Canmore 2015/2016 to exchange information. 
        We would like to use the knowledge of these groundworks to develop a new type of enzymatic cleaning agent by complementing and combining ideas out of different scientific sources. 
        To differ from other projects we are aiming to engineer <I>Escherichia coli</I> to express enzymes like esterases, lipases and keratinases into the medium. 
        Due to the extracellular expression expensive and time-consuming purification steps could be avoided and the enzymes could be secreted directly into the drain. As a special feature we want to use the metabolites of the enzymatic degradation to produce a lovely rose-scent to refresh your whole room. 
        In addition this reaction could also be used to indicate that the enzymes are working efficiently on your drainage problem.

            For the first degradation step we choose a combination of  esterases and lipases.
            Lipases and esterases are lipolytic enzymes that are used in food processing, beverages, therapeutics and degradation of synthetic materials (Panda und Gowrishankar 2005). 
            Lipases (EC. 3.1.1.3) and esterases (EC. 3.1.1.1) are hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis (and synthesis) of triacylglycerols into acid and alcohol molecules. 
            They differ mainly on the basis of substrate specifity and activation mechanism. 
            Lipases hydrolase triacylglyderols with longer fatty acid chains than esterases and lipases have a hydrophobic domain covering their active site. 
            Therefore lipases need to be activated with organic solvents to make the active site accessible for substrates. 
            Esterases and lipases are classified into 8 groups on the basis of the conserved sequence motifs and biological properties. 
            EstCS2 belongs to class VII (Kang et al. 2011; Shamsher Singh Kanwar).
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"><P>We investigated two different esterases for their enzyme activity. 
          One esterase from the registry (EstCS2 BBa_K1149002) and one esterase (LipB) supplied by Dr. Eggert from Evoxx were compared. 
          Additionally, we choose the lipase TliA to support the esterases at the fat degradation and to accelerate the entire degradation process. 
          For the extracellular secretion of the enzymes we attached the signal sequence PelB which was provided on the iGEM plates.

      In our project we didn’t purify the esterases but used the supernatant for the enzyme activity assay. 
      Furthermore, we investigated the enzyme activity of LipB. 
      We performed the enzyme assay from the iGEM Team TU Darmstadt that we also used for EstCS2.

          We want to profit from them by applying them on clugged pipes full of hair that is a common issue in lots of households. 
          Keratinases are enzymes that are capable of degrading hair. 
          Hair mostly consists of alpha-Keratin. Many different keratinases produced by different Bacilli, Actinobacteria and fungi have been reported. 
          All of them vary by having their specific biochemical and biophysical properties e.g. temperature and pH activity range. 
          Using their proteolytic capability that destroys hair we want to use them to avoid chemical compounds that are recently mainly applied to cleanse tubes. 
          By hydrolization of disulfide bonds keratin degrades. This is due to confirmation changes which leads to an exposure of more sites for keratinase action (Satyanarayana et al. 2013, Vignardes et al. 1999). Previous projects from iGEM Teams such as Sheffield 2014, Team Canmore 2015 and Team Canmore 2016 helped us to tackle this problem as they were regarding similar problems.

     In recent years microorganisms such as <I>E.coli</I> and Yeast have been metabolically engineered to produce different flavors like limonene, geraniol or rose (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al 2017, W. Liu and R. Zhang et al. 2015, I. Guterman and M. Shalit et al. 2002). 
    For our project we discussed different approaches and choose two different scents: rose and limonene.
  </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"><H4>... rose fragrance</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8"><P>As first special fragrance we want to install a lovely scent of rose in our microbial system. Hair are commonly made of Keratin (98%) and small amounts of amino acids, such as L-phenylalanine. 
         This amino acid can be used as substrate for the production of 2-Phenylethylacetate (2-PEAc), which is a high-value aromatic ester with a rose-like odor (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al. 2017).
         Therefor this odor can act as an indicator for keratin degradation. 2-phenylethylacetate is in high demand and widely udes as an additive in food, drinks, perfumes and cosmetics (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al.).
         Currently, 2-PEAc is mainly produced by chemical synthesis, but consumers prefer more natural flavour compounds in the field of food and cosmetics. 
         But extraction of natural 2-PEAc is cost and time-intensive (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al. 2017). 
         Therefor the production of 2-PEAc using microorgansims such as <I>E.coli</I> can be an attractive alternative (D. Guo and L. Zhang et al. 2017).
         In recent studies from Guo et al the 2-PEAc biosynthetic pathway was successfully designed and expressed in <I>E.coli </I>. 
         For our project we want to use this pathway for the production of a lovely rose scent by <I>E.coli</I>.

  Type I is a mechanism consisting of one step across the two cellular membranes without a periplasmic intermediate. 
  One disadvantage of type I mechanism ist hat the signal peptide remains attached so an additional cleavage step is required to obtain the mature protein. 
  Type II mechanism can be divided in three submechanisms: SecB-dependend pathway, SRP pathway and TAT (twin arginine translocation) pathway. 
  Type II is a two step mechanism. 
  The non processed proteins are attached with a a signal sequence and exported to the periplasm. 
  The premature protein is processed into the mature protein by cleavage of the signal peptide. 
  The SecB pathway is the mostly used way for the extracellular production of recombinant proteins. 
  SRP can be used for proteins that fold too quickly and incorrectly in the cytoplasm and TAT allows the secretion of poteins that are already folded. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row section"><DIV class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12"><P>In our project we use the SecB dependend pathway to secrete the enzymes. 
  We needed to optimize the expression level with appropriate promotor strength to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies. 
  Additionally it’s important to achieve high secretion levels which is a known problem in recombinant enzyme secretion. 
  The efficiency of the protein secretion depends on the host strain, signal sequence and the type of protein to be secreted (e. g. high protein size causes limited enzyme secretion).
