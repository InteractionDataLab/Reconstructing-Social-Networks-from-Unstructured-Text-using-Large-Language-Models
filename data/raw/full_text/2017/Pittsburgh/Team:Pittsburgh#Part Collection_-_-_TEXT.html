Our part collection is BBa_K2476000 to BBa_K2476014. It consists of wildtype and mutant chemotaxis proteins (CheY) and Dronpa. This collection has been designed for flexibility in designing fusion proteins of CheY and Dronpa. Although we have basic parts where dronpa is already inserted into CheY, we also designed a stand-alone Dronpa allowing for insertion of the one Dronpa into wherever is most suited for the protein. The Dronpa-terminator with the stand-alone Dronpa allows for flexibility in adding a pair of Dronpa since there is already a built in terminator. The wildtype and mutant CheY also allows for a wide variety of testing because the different chemotactic outcome can be used in tandem experiments to act as controls for the other. In addition, the design of mutant CheY to be constitutively swimming allows for better visualization of the effects of Dronpa on blockage of CheY binding to other chemotaxis proteins.
