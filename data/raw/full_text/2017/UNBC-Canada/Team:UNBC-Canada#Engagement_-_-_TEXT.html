ithin our community, and surrounding Northern communities, there is a collective absence regarding interest in synthetic biology. Furthermore, our team is dedicated to sharing the field of synthetic biology with the public, but especially young learners to garner interest and excitement about the amazing world synthetic biology has to offer. With all of our team members haven grown up in Northern British Columbia, we reflected on our elementary and high school experiences, and recognized that what was collectively missing was enthusiasm for science and introductions to the ample fields that exist. Therefore, we wanted to have a synthetic biology presence in our community and those surrounding to introduce eager learners, and youth specifically to synthetic biology and its vast applications.
This year, our team brought ‘Synthetic Biology to the North’ in the following ways:
Northern Education
Activity Book for Elementary School Students.
We created a synthetic biology activity book for use in elementary schools. Each activity we included is interactive and fun, meant to introduce young learners to introductory synthetic biology concepts and how to follow scientific procedures. Every activity includes background knowledge the teacher can use to explain the science behind the experiment as well as learning objectives to highlight the most important points, it also includes procedures and materials. We wanted to make sure this could be used in all elementary school classrooms so we made sure that all required materials are inexpensive and easily obtained! Once the book was developed we reached out to both private and public elementary schools across Northern BC, including our hometown Prince George, and over 15 other towns spanning the region. Our outreach was enthusiastically received and elementary school teachers were eager to use the activity book in their classrooms!
Science Alliance Camps
In the summer months, our local museum runs science camps for kids of various age groups. This year we collaborated with the Science Alliance camp for kids aged 4-6. For each camp in July and August members of our team were welcomed as guests to teach the kids about DNA. For each group we first talked about DNA in a fun and interactive way then walked the kids, in pairs, through a strawberry DNA extraction. We then built tooth-pick and marshmallow DNA double helices. For this we talked about the fundamental structure of DNA and proper base-pairing. We then used the vacuum chamber to “blow-up” the marshmallow DNA. These camps were a raging success! Each group listened intently to us teaching and participated actively asking great questions as we moved along. What’s more, in the August camp the children spontaneously began chanting DNA! Based on how well we were received we were, we plan on collaborating with the camps again next year.
Highschool Presentations
Another way we brought synthetic biology to the north was through classroom presentations at local high schools and as well as high schools in towns surrounding us; these included North Peace Secondary School in Fort Saint John, Correlieu Secondary School in Quesnel, Prince George Secondary School, and College Heights Secondary School in Prince George. Our presentations were constructed to garner young interest in synthetic biology as a field. We discussed introductory concepts on synthetic biology, applications of biotechnology including CRSIPR, and finished off each presentation with what iGEM is, and what our team was working on this year. Each class we visited were vibrating with interest on the new concepts, and were highly interactive with thoughtful questions.
Lesson Plans for High School Students
In conversations with local high school teachers we learned that only basic synthetic biology concepts are taught in grade 11 and 12 biology classrooms, while the unit on biotechnology previously included was removed from the British Columbia curriculum in 2016. We decided to act on this and create short lessons regarding introductory synthetic biology and biotechnology that could be easily integrated into the busy schedule of the high school classrooms. Our lesson book is a simple interactive material that serves to introduce high school students to the field of synthetic biology and introductory biotechnology. Each lesson includes a short one to two-page write-up of a specific concept(s), followed by a concept check. Each student reads the lesson then can answer the questions independently in class or as homework, in groups, or as class discussion. Our lesson book was enthusiastically received by high school teachers around Prince George, as well as by teachers in other communities. We distributed the finished product to the interested teachers for them to use as additional classroom material throughout the year and for years to come.
Central Interior Science Exhibition
In April, we participated in the Central Interior Science Exhibition Demonstration at UNBC. This event fit perfectly into our initiative “Bringing Synthetic Biology to the North”. At this event, we had the opportunity to provide hands-on and interactive activities for young students ranging from 7-12.  For one activity, we conducted Strawberry DNA Extractions, first we talked about DNA, what it is, and what it means to us as humans and how our DNA is different from a strawberry’s. We walked groups of children through the extraction process, talking about what each reagent was doing to help us extract the DNA. For the other activity, we constructed complementary base pair bracelets. Four different colored beads symbolized the four bases. The kids were given a color-DNA sequence that they in turn complemented with the appropriate bead. The day turned out to be a raging success with enthusiastic participants and great conversations about synthetic biology with both the children and parents alike!
Northern Outreach
Science Fair Judging at a Local Elementary School
Some of our members had the opportunity to act as guest judges at a local science fair for elementary school students. In addition to judging the projects, we had the opportunity to talk to the students about synthetic biology and antibiotic resistance to promote awareness at a young age.
Synthetic Biology in the Park
Every Canada day one of our local parks is crawling with patriotic Canadians. We wanted to share in the spirit of Canada and use this gathering to interact with the public. We focused our conversations on education and talked about synthetic biology, GMOs and antibiotic resistant bacteria. We set up an information booth with an information poster, information pamphlets and a giant white board for people to share with us what synthetic biology means to them. At this event, we had the opportunity to clear up misconceptions, learn from people with experience, educate on new concepts or concepts people were unfamiliar with, as well as show our community what their local iGEM team is up to!
TEDxUNBC
In conjunction with the TEDxUNBC convention at our school we joined many organizations in setting up an information booth for the public attending the event. At our booth, we had an information poster and pamphlets regarding GMO’s, synthetic biology, antibiotic resistance, MRSA and iGEM. We also had a white board to ask the public what they think about synthetic biology and GMO’s, this interactive tool worked wonders to open up conversations, clarify questions and connect over synthetic biology. This event brought heavy traffic past our booth, by the end of the day we had the opportunity to talk with a range of individuals, and work towards our initiative to bring synthetic biology to the North!
Spirit of the North Healthcare Foundation - Spirit Day
Spirit of the North Healthcare Foundation has been an active supporter and sponsor of our team the past two years. Therefore, we were motivated to give back to them for all they have done for us. Spirit of the North Healthcare Foundation pledged to raise $500,000 to support the purchase of state of the art diagnostic equipment for University Hospital of Northern BC, consisting of a suite of ultrasounds with Echo capabilities. Our role was to help promote Spirit Day, a day dedicated to raising funds for this initiative. We helped by standing with signage in front of the hospital prompting passer-byers to phone in and make donations. We also spent time on the phones to receive donations and call potential donors to invite them to donate. Spirit Day raised over $50,00 towards their overall goal.
UNBC Synthetic Biology Club Outreach
Every year, UNBC kicks off the semester with Clubs Day. This year we set up a booth to promote our Synthetic Biology Club which acts as the student feed for next years iGEM team. At our booth we talked about what we do as a club, iGEM, our project and the potential to join the iGEM team the following year!
Pub Night Fundraisers
This year we hosted two fundraiser pub nights. We used these pub nights to not only raise money to send team members to the Giant Jamboree but also to promote our team and synthetic biology club. Our first event, Glow Hard or Glow Home, was held in February as a kick off for the new iGEM project and garner interest in our team. Our second event, the Unofficial Backyard BBQ After Party, was held in September as a final fundraising push and to promote our club and team to new and returning members.
