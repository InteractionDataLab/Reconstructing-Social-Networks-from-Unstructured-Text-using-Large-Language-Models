Lac Inducible Expression Cassette for Hfq
The first step.
To study Hfq, we must first express and purify it. We did this by inserting the gene for Staphylococcus aureus Hfq into a lac inducible expression cassette previously constructed by iGEM Washington in 2010 (BBa_K314103).
The components of the expression cassette include:
f1 origin
lacI
lacI regulated lambda pL hybrid promoter
Elowitz (1999) strong RBS
The expression machinery has been optimized for use in E. coli.

Expression efficacy assessed
The above gel shows expression levels from different time points and purified fractions after induction with 0.8mM IPTG. Lanes are as follows from left â†’ right:
Ladder
T = 0h
T = 1h
T = 2h
T = 12h
T = 14h
T = 18h
Fraction 1
Fraction 2
Fraction 3
Note the feint bands highlighted by the box. Our lab did not have a ladder that was small enough to include Hfq, which is a small protein of 8.9kDa, therefore the bands of interest containing Hfq were below the dye front. Expression was strongest at T = 18h, with the most protein being isolated in fraction 1.
