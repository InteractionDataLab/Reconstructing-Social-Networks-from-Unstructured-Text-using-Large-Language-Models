Sharing the Experience of iGEM
Lab Tutorial Video Series - East Chapel Hill High School
In collaboration with East Chapel Hill High School iGEMs "Tasty Lab" lab tutorial video series, we contributed a video tutorial on how to run and analyze an agarose gel. The target audience for this video are those that know about agarose gels, the theory, as well as the applications, but haven't actually poured and ran a gel themselves. Find the link HERE!
Lab Safety Video Series - Tübingen iGEM
We contributed to team Tübingen iGEMs lab safety video series by providing a video outlining how to properly read an MSDS and PSDS before working with any unfamiliar chemicals or organisms. We believe that being able to properly navigate safety forms is an ever-important skill and is somewhat lost in todays labs, as many of the chemicals we work with on a daily basis are fairly benign. Ethanol, ethidium bromide, and pathogenic E. coli, along with their safety considerations, are covered in this video. Find the link HERE!
Synthetic Biology Playing Cards - Franconia
We put together five playing cards for team Franconia's interactive and education-based synthetic biology card game (the game can be found here ). Because our project is based on antibiotic resistance, we made our cards related to our project and included: MRSA, methicillin, vancomycin, hand hygiene and Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B. Our cards can be found here.
Calgary iGEM - Canada-wide Newsletter
We participated in a Canada-wide monthly newsletter hosted by the University of Calgary iGEM team . The goal of the newsletter was to keep all the Canadian teams up to date on the research and human practices efforts being made by the other Canadian teams. Prior to this, we had a skype call with Calgary iGEM to discuss our projects and iGEM, as we are a young team and they had much advice to offer.
