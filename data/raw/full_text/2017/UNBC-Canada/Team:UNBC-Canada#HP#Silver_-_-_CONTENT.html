While we were planning our project, we wanted to get a head start on public engagement. Our goal was to inform and educate the public on the dangers of antibiotic resistant bacteria, synthetic biology and its place in healthcare research, as well as the research we are taking part in and what is possible at UNBC. What better way to reach out to the public than to be featured on multiple different news networks! Initially, we were covered <A href="http://www.unbc.ca/newsroom/unbc-stories/synthetic-biology-club-combatting-mrsa-super-bug"> in a story by UNBC</A>, showcasing our team, iGEM, and our research on MRSA. Some major local and national news networks then contacted us, including <A href="http://www.ckpg.com/2017/02/09/148056/"> CKPG news</A>, Vista Radio, and the <A href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-biology-students-looking-for-new-ways-to-kill-antibiotic-resistant-superbug-1.3975371"> Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC)</A>. We conducted numerous live radio interviews and were featured both on TV and a frequently viewed <A href="https://www.250news.com/2017/02/09/unbc-students-take-on-super-bug/">news website</A>in our area, as well as a major paper, the <A href="http://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/news/local-news/unbc-synthetic-biology-club-seeking-members-1.9775075?utm_campaign=magnet&amp;utm_source=article_page&amp;utm_medium=related_articles">Prince George Citizen</A>.
</P><H3>Education and Public Engagement </H3><P>Based on perceived and vocalized lack of knowledge on synthetic biology in Northern communities, we decided to develop the initiative “Bringing Synthetic Biology to the North”. This multifaceted effort aimed to engage and educate people of all ages in Northern communities about synbio, antibiotic resistant bacteria, MRSA, and iGEM. Through our initiative, we successfully reached out to community members, elementary and highschool students. The activity-book and lesson plans we developed and distributed to teachers in elementary and high-schools, respectively, were designed to educate, garner interest, and introduce young students to the field of synthetic biology. This fulfilled one of our main goals: early education, wanting to share with young learners what our team collectively felt was missing from our primary and secondary educations. We also spread our initiative through outreach at community functions, where we had the opportunity to engage and educate the public, and share our passion about synbio.</P><H4>Read more about our initiative <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:UNBC-Canada/Engagement"> HERE!</A></H4></DIV></DIV></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
