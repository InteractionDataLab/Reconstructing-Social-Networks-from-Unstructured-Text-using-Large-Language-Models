To help promote iGEM, we offer a Special Topics in Biology course for team members. This course began in June and runs alongside the iGEM project, giving our students course credit for their contribution to the team. The course combines short lessons on applicable synthetic biology and lab techniques as well as a discussional classroom environment to share ideas, learn, and problem solve. Because the course changes by the project, the syllabus is designed accordingly and not published online. This year, hour contribution (a total of 100 hours throughout the summer) made up a significant amount of the course grade with the remainder split between presentations, annotated bibliographies, and a final lab report. iGEM brainstorming, however, did precede the course and began in January with the Synthetic Biology Club, while project work began in May and lab work began in July.</P></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
