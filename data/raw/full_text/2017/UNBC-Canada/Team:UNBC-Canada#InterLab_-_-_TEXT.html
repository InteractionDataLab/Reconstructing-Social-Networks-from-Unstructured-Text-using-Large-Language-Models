InterLab
We were happy to participate in the Fourth International InterLab Study as part of our bronze medal criteria. For our team, it functioned not only in making a contribution to iGEM as a global, scientific whole; however, it provided our team members with an introduction to fluorescence measurements and how to use the plate reader in our lab. We used the Synergy 2 plate reader from Biotek.
The protocol for the InterLab study can be found here . Special considerations in our case are as follows:
384 well plates used in place of 96-well plates → total volume used was half that stated in the protocol. Fluorescence data were multiplied by a factor of 2 to correct for halving the volume.
Fluorescence data for [flourescein] greater than 12.5μM fall outside the linear range, and thus indicate the limits of our plate reader. Gain was lowered to 25, which is the lower limit of the plate reader.
