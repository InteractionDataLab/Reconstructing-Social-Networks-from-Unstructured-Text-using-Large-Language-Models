The Team
Brent MurrayPrinciple Investigator
I am a biologist whose primary research is in Molecular Evolution and Ecology.  I have worked on a range of species/problems from fungal diseases of trees, to insect outbreaks, to genomic and population genetic studies of amphibians, fish, birds and mammals.  These studies currently involve the use of environmental DNA to monitor species, analysis of genomes to assess population structure and adaptive loci, and analysis of transcriptomes to explore function differences among populations.  This is my first time acting as supervisor of the UNBC iGEM team.
Brendan ReiterDirector of Project and Wiki Design and Wet Lab Operations
Hello fellow iGEMmers! I am in my fifth and final year of an honours biochemistry and molecular biology degree with a chemistry minor, and this is my second year participating in iGEM with UNBC's second ever iGEM team. Outside of the iGEM lab, you can find me investigating the anti-cancer properties of wild mushrooms from Northern BC. I enjoy bodybuilding, volleyball, basketball, and am an avid coffee connoisseur. I can lay down a mean drum solo and will laugh longer than appropriate at a dad joke.
Keanna WoidakDirector of Human Practices and Public Outreach
Hello! I am in my last year of my Biomedical Studies degree. This is my second year being apart of iGEM! Beyond iGEM and the lab, I enjoy experiencing food and the flavors of the world, and admit to having an extreme sweet tooth. To balance my love for food, I spend much of my spare time exercising being an avid and a passionate long-distance runner.
Connor JohnsonStudent Member
I am in my third year of a Biochemistry and molecular biology degree. I joined this project because I have personally seen how MRSA affects friends and rural communities. My hope is to contribute to the global effort to develop more effective treatment options against multi drug resistant bacterial species.
Katelynn RozmarniewichStudent Member
I am in my final year of BSc BCMB. Previously, I attended college for Integrated Science and Registered Nursing. I am pursuing a MSc in Biochemistry and MD in Northern BC. My main interest is in the detection, treatment and global impacts of Cervical Cancer. Outside my passion for Health, I hold a strong fervidness to challenging myself through travel. These are ways I better my understanding of our planet and ourselves while staying cultivated.
Lon KerrStudent Member and ex-Student Leader
Lon Kerr is one of the founding members of UNBC’s iGEM team. Lon’s primary interests are in biochemistry and molecular biology but throughout his undergrad he has found the opportunity to indulge side projects in analytical chemistry. If Lon could do anything he would fly kites. His dream activity is flying his 10m power kite over the waves any lake that will welcome him. Through working with others Lon believes that anything is possible and that there is no challenge too ominous to handle!
Jason ChuStudent Member
I am currently in my fourth year studying Biochemistry. I love science and it has been a blast working with this awesome team. Some of my other interests include listening to and playing music, all sports, and eating fantasies food!
Jared PritchardStudent Member
Hey I’m Jared a 3rd year bio-medical student, outside of school I’m interested in food, house music, and beach volleyball. My favorite condiment is hot sauce, favorite desert is chocolate cake and favorite meal is probably pizza with hot sauce. In my spare time you are most likely to find me eating and listening to music.
Michael SimmonsStudent Member
I am an international student from the Bahamas, majoring in Biochemistry. I've joined our iGEM team because I am very interested in genetic modification and it's limits in helping a wide array of issues within our world today. Music and travelling excite me, especially when I'm able to learn and new language and culture
Raliat AbioyeStudent Member
Hey guys! I am in my third year of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I am originally from Brampton, Ontario where I lived for 15 years. An interesting fact about me is that I was born in London, England and I would love to move back in the future. I chose to be a part of the UNBC iGEM team because I was excited to see the great innovations students can come up with with just a little bit of creativity and inspiration for solving world issues. I am excited and very proud to be a part of such an amazing team filled with various different personalities and experience levels meshing together to achieve a common goal.
Aashka JaniStudent Member
I’m currently in my fourth year of a double major in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Psychology. My career goal is to one day obtain a medical degree and become a practicing physician. I was born in Chicago but have lived in Prince George for the past 17 years. One of the things I love about Northern BC is that it is continually emerging with new opportunities.
