Hfq
The missing piece from the gene silencing puzzle.
Gene silencing in E. coli hinges on the proper functioning of Hfq. Hfq, a dsRNA binding chaperone protein, stabilizes the interaction between sRNA and its target mRNA to allow for degradation by RNase III.
In Staphylococcus species, the role of Hfq is much more ambiguous, with some literature commenting on its essentiality in sRNA mediated gene silencing, and some disproving its role in the process entirely.
A major facet of our project was to add to the conversation surrounding the role of Hfq in gene silencing within Staphylococcus species.
