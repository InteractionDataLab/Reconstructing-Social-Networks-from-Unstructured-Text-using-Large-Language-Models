2017 Project Design
This year we started our project brainstorming in February after we hired the 2017 team. We allowed anyone on the team to come up with any preliminary ideas and then split into separate groups to research each of the ideas that were brought forth individually. After a bit of research into each of the projects, the projects were then repitched to the whole team and the members were instructed to vote.
After voting was done by the team, we met with the advisors on our team, to discuss the results of the voting and to gain a more expert opinion on the project we should pursue. Ultimately we decided to go with the current project and "Prions Be Lit" became our project.
Our team, which consisted of 33 people from different backgrounds and majors was split into three subteams to focus on the wet lab portion of the experiments, the policy and practices, and the modelling and software component. These three subteams continued to develop different components of the project.
After the projects components were detailed, the team executed the project which consisted of experimental designs, creation of mathematical models, public engagement events, and research into human practices. The project was developed independently by the 2017 Waterloo iGEM team.
Training
The Waterloo iGEM Lab and Design team was trained by the two lab leads, Max Reed and Cody Receno. Additional lab training was provided for use on special equipment and is listed below.
Co-op Student
Jamie Lam was the Waterloo iGEM 2017 co-op student. He was a full time member in our lab and provided valuable help to the wet lab team.
