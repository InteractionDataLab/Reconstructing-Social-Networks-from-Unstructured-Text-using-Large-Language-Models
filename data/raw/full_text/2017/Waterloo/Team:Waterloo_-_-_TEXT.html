Functional Amyloid as a Biological Tool
Created with Sketch.
Prion like proteins can stick
together and form aggregates
Aggregates are generally thought to be
harmful to some cells, but functional
amyloid and engineered prions could be a
useful tool in medicine, research, and
manufacturing
Functional amyloids are found in
nature, however little is known
about how proteins behave when
they are in aggregates
We aim to enhance the function and better understand engineered proteins in aggregates
