Making Competent Cells
Step
Method
1
Streak E.coli cells on an LB plate.
2
Allow cells to grow at 37°C overnight.
3
Place one colony in 10 mL LB media(+antibiotic selection if necessary), grow overnight at 37°C.
4
Take 2 ml LB media and save for blank. Transfer 500 µL overnight culture into 50 mL LB media in 250 mL flask.
5
Allow cell to grow at 37°C (200 rpm), until OD600= 0.5 (~2-3 hours).
6
Place cells on ice for 30 minutes.
7
Transfer cells to a centrifuge tube (50 mL), and centrifuge cells at 4°C for 10 minutes at 4,000×g.
8
Pour off media and resuspend cells in 12 mL of cold TB.
9
Centrifuge cells at 4°C for 10 minutes at 4,000×g.
10
Pour supernatant and resuspend cells (by pipetting) in 4 mL of cold TB and 280 µL of DMSO. Transfer 100 µL to 1.5 mL tube.
11
Ependorff tubes placed on ice. Freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen. Cells stored at -80°C can be used for transformation for up to ~6 months.

Miniprep
Step
Method
1
Pellet 1-4ml of overnight culture by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the supertanant completely.
2
Add 250ul of SolutionⅠto the pellet to resuspend bacteria cells.
3
Add 250ul of SolutionⅡ, mix gently by inverting the tube 7-8 times until the solution becomes clear. The time should be no longer than 5 minutes.
4
Add 350ul of SolutionⅢ, mix gently by inverting the tube 7-8 times.
5
Centrifuge at 12,000rpm for 10 minutes.
6
Place spin column into a 1.5ml collection tube. Transfer supernatant in the step above to the column. Centrifuge at 12,000rpm for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
7
Return the column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 600ul of Buffer PW. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
8
Return the column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 600ul of Buffer PW. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
9
Place the column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 2 minute. Discard the filtrate and the 2ml microfuge tube.
10
Place the spin column onto dry block heater for 8 minute.
11
Transfer the column into a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube .Add 60-80ul of Eluent or deionized water to the center of the membrane to elute the DNA. Let it stand for 1 minute at room temperature. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Repeat this operation two times. Note: Pre-warm the Eluent or deionized water at 50℃ will generally improve elution efficiency.
 
Electrophoresis
1. Agalose Gel casting
1) Measure out the appropriate mass of agarose into glass bottle with the appropriate volume of TAE buffer.
2) Microwave until the agarose is fully melted.
3) Pour the agarose solution into the gelbox and let it cool for about 30 minutes, until the gel is solid.
4) Remove comb.
2.Running agalose gel
1) Load 5 μL prepared 1kbp ladder.
2) Mix DNA solution with loading buffer (5x).
3) Load it into agalose gel.
4) Run the gel at ~110 volts for 30 minutes.
3.Visualizing agarose gels
1) Remove gel from gel box.
2) Soak the gel in ethidium bromide solution.
3) Place the gel in Trans-Illuminator and turn on UV light after make sure the door closing.
4) Print the picture.
5) Remove gel and throw in trash.
