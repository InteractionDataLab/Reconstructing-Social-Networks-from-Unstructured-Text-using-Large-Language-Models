Team Introduction
      Three senior, seven junior and two sophomore students formed our team, that is SICAU - China . We are from different grades, different majors, but we have the same aspiration.  We get familiar with each other from the first meet to learning and working together. In this process, we not only harvest knowledge and experimental skills,  but also grow together, waiting for the results and then smiling or  being disappointed .This is a team with joy, as all the other IGEM teams.
      We appreciate our instructors, advisors and all the others who has provided valuable advices and essential materials for our project. Thanks for the dedication of all of you, because of it, we made it.

Hello,
I’m a senior student majoring in bioengineering. I’ve been in the team for three years, and also the second team leader since my team setting up. In 2017 iGEM, in which my team participated for the first time, we have to face to kinds of problems containing unfamiliar competition process, inadequate knowledge reserves, and even lack of funding. However, both my team and iGEM competition have brought me a colorful and unforgettable college life.
