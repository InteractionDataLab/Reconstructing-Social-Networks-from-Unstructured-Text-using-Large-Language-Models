After which he took us to the pigsty and sheep fold and show us the production of feed, they generally use the antibiotic premix. The addition of antibiotics in different animals, the same animal of different growth periods are different. Commonly used residual detection method is ELISA, but its specificity and sensitivity to be improved, and the reaction takes longer.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="event2"><H1>Second event:Investigation of antibiotic residues and detection in the environment</H1><DIV class="p-size">      We learned condition about the use of antibiotics in animal feed by taking an interview with an interviewer and visiting the Food and Drug Administration. Due to low prices of antibiotics, it is a lot of use in the feeding of animals. Add antibiotics to the feed, which can inhibit growth of the pathogens in animals and reduce animal mortality. Therefore, the problems of animal disease complicating and antibiotics residue get more serious. On the one hand, we will spend a lot of energy to treat the difficult animal diseases. Besides, antibiotics residue flow to the environment which cause a large number of resistant bacteria multiply, polluting the surrounding water.      Now, using Liquid Chromatography to detect antibiotics is the main way which the costs are high and taking a long time. We also exchanged our projects with teachers and technical staff at the same time. According to our survey results, the using microbiological detection of antibiotics has great significance, which reducing reliance on precision instruments and detection costs significantly.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="event3"><H1>Third event: An investigation of antibiotic residues</H1><DIV class="hp3">      This summer,we designed a signal amplification system using microorganisms to achieve trace detection of antibiotics or other substances. We would like to know the public's attitude towards the detection and prevention of antibiotics. Setting up an online questionnaire help us learn more about antibiotics. From the survey results, we can find that it is necessary to detect antibiotics and we need to do more to strengthen public understanding of antibiotics. The statistical results are as follows:</DIV><DIV class="hp3x"><DIV class="p-size">1. What is your gender?
    </DIV><DIV class="p-size">2. Do you often use antibiotics in your daily life?
    </DIV><DIV class="p-size">3.Do you know the difference between tetracycline antibiotics and cephalosporins antibiotics?
    </DIV><DIV class="p-size">4. Do you think you have had antibiotic abuse?

It is an opportunity to wising this emerging subject for students learning biological. There is no synthetic biology course in our school, so we hold that talking about Interesting project design to inspire more people knowing synthetic biology and joining it.      We introduced the history of synthetic biology development, the sophisticated design, and meaningful projects like using E. coli as a test tool to detect contaminants in the environment to promote their comprehension of synthetic biology.      This measure makes Synthetic biology into more students’ vision no matter what major they learn. More and more people are interesting in Synthetic biology and join us in this way.</DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV><P>contact us: <A href="mailto:sicau_igem@163.com">sicau_igem@163.com</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
