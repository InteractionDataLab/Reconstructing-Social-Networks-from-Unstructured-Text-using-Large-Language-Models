We are from different grades, different majors, but we have the same aspiration.  We get familiar with each other from the first meet to learning and working together. In this process, we not only harvest knowledge and experimental skills,  but also grow together, waiting for the results and then smiling or  being disappointed .This is a team with joy, as all the other IGEM teams.      We appreciate our instructors, advisors and all the others who has provided valuable advices and essential materials for our project. Thanks for the dedication of all of you, because of it, we made it.</DIV><H2>Our PI</H2><DIV id="advisor"><DIV id="advisorblock"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION> Qi Wu </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="p-size">Ph.D. Professor, doctoral tutor, director of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences.
