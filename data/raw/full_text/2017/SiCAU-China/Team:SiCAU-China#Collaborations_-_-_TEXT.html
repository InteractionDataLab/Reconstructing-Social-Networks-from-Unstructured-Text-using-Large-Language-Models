Introduction & Acknowledgements
      This is our first time to participate in iGEM. We are completely novice, so the collaborations with other teams help us a lot in the process of carrying out experimental projects. This summer, we received a lot of teams’ help when we encountered straits from the project preparation to the experimental development owing to lack of experience and support. We would greatly appreciate these teams, SCU-China, SCU-WestChina, TMMU-China, UESTC-China, Peking, Shanghaitech. Furthermore, we also do our best to help other teams, striving for better results through mutual cooperation.
 
SiCAU & iSWU
      We joined the iSWU in 2015 which brings together all iGEM teams in Southwest China and some teams interested in iGEM. Members of the union include TMMU-China, UESTC-China, SCU-China, SCU-WestChina and so on. This year,the iSWU meeting was held by SCU-WestChina in April 2017 for each teams exchange views on the displayed projects. We had a more profound understanding of the project after participating in this exchange. The teachers gave us numerous inspirations of design and optimization the project after showing the initial project on cancer detection.It is also the intention of holding the southwest conference in the early stage, in order to discover the deficiencies and limitations of the project through communication, and improve it before the experiment is carried out. In terms of entry matters, we lack the experience of iGEM due to we are the first time to participate in this competition. iSWU gave us a lot of useful assistance, such as how to register, introduction of the schedule, experience of visa processing and so on. In a nutshell, iSWU played an vital role from our project preparation to complete the experiment. Thanks for the iSWU , the relationship of each team is closer.
 
SiCAU&SCU-China /SCU-WestChina
      At the start of experiment, we can not carry out owing to lacking templates before kits arriving. Team “SCU-China” provided us with many the past iGEM parts solving our problem at the southwest exchanging meet. Besides, when SCU-China sought help due to lacking of experimental material, we provided team “SCU-China” LUDOX in our measurement kit to help them complete interlab. We provided the team “SCU-WestChina” the chassis cell , Salmonella, which can degrades uric acid.
SiCAU & UESTC-China
      Team “UESTC-China” lacked wild type of enzyme as comparison to meet the bronze standard. They chose to mutate mutant enzymes to wild type again. We helped them build the DhaA31 using the method of overlap pcr which as the control of BBa-K1199043. This part encodes the halogenated alkane dehalogenase which can degradat the trichloropropane to 2,3-2 chloro-1-propanol.
