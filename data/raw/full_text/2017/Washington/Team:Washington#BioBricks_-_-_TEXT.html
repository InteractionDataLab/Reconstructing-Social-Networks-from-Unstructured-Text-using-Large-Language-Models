Our project involves using yeast! While yeast is used ubiquitously in synthetic biology, the Biobricks Repository still has very few yeast Biobricks. Thus, we made and characterized 2 fundamental biobricks that future teams can use:
ICL1 Yeast Promoter - http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2391000
ZAP1 Yeast Promoter - http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2391001
