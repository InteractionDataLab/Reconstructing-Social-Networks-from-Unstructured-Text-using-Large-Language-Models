Project-Specific Safety Concerns
Working with electrical equipment can be dangerous if not used properly. Because electrical hardware has played a large role in our project, we thoroughly educated users on safety within the lab. It is essential to ensure that wires are protected and electrical circuits are not exposed to liquid, especially since liquid cultures are vital to the setup. Improper care around electrical devices could cause serious injury.
The device contains glass, which could break and harm the user if the setup were knocked over. Therefore, the setup must be kept away from potentially hazardous objects on a flat and dry surface. The surrounding area must be kept clean and free of clutter. Our lab members have been trained in clean-up protocols for broken glass and liquid spills.
While biological waste like E. coli, genetically engineered yeast, and synthetic media pose only a small risk to humans, animals, and the environment, it is still important to keep these items contained during use and waste disposal.  Biological waste and media are bleached and and waste bags are autoclaved before disposal in order to prevent their release into the environment.
While Violacein and its related forms have not fully been investigated, they have been declared non-hazardous according to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. (" Violacein 548-54-9 MSDS, Safety Technical Specifications _ MSDS ").
As we move forward with our automated culture system, user safety protocols will be developed to ensure proper operation by manufacturers who implement our system in their bioprocesses.
General Safety in Our Lab
What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
Our project is BioSafety Level 1. We work with common lab strains of yeast and E. coli, which are kept in closed containers and always handled with gloves. Closed-toe shoes are required in our lab. We autoclave all biohazard waste. When running gel electrophoresis, we use Sybr Safe, which is a mutagen. To minimize exposure, we wear gloves and work in a contained space (fume hood) and use equipment that is not used for other experiments. Chloroform is occasionally used in a hood to contain fumes.
What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use? What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
If developed into a commercial product, engineered yeast could be released into the environment, with unknown consequences. Although we expect that our yeast would pose no health threat, environmental risk could be minimized by the addition of a genetic killswitch into our system.
Do the biological materials used in your lab work pose any of the following risks?
A. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
Using E. coli poses a potential risk to the health and safety of our team members working in the lab if it is handled improperly or consumed. It may cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract and may adversely affect kidneys.
Using Sybr Safe and Ethidium Bromide to make gels poses health risks because both chemicals are mutagens.
B. Risks to the safety and health of the general public, if released by design or by accident?
The risks to the safety and health of the general public are the same as those for individuals directly working with these biological materials.
C. Risks to the environment, if released by design or by accident?
Sybr Safe and Ethidium Bromide both cause risks to the environment because they are both mutagens.
D. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
There is slight concern for the misuse of our systems, since any gene could be substituted in place of the existing outputs.
What safety training have you received (or plan to receive in the future)? Provide a brief description, and a link to your institution's safety training requirements, if available.
All students working in lab have completed online courses in biosafety, chemical safety, fire extinguisher safety, globally harmonized system, and electrical safety as required by the University of Washington and administered by our department of Environmental Health and Safety. All student members of our team have been trained by student advisers during in-person safety orientations in our labspace, which covered fire and earthquake safety, chemical spills, locations of safety equipment, autoclave safety, waste disposal rules, and personal protective equipment. Our team leadership also ran extensive lab training that covered sterile technique and basic protocols. Advisers have been trained by their respective labs in accordance with the University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety Committee's regulations. Regular EH&S inspections ensure that the lab is up to university lab standards.
Under what biosafety provisions will/do you work?
A. Please provide a link to your institution biosafety guidelines.
Environmental Health and Safety at the University of Washington
B. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or an equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them?
The University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety (UW EHS) committee determines biosafety regulations and guidelines for all labs associated with our campus. We have not discussed this specific iGEM project with members of the EHS committee; however, we are working closely with our sponsor labs and have been trained according to the guidelines which they follow.
C. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible?
The United States of America has national biosafety regulations and guidelines determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifics about their guidelines can be found on their biosafety page .
D. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible?
The United States of America has national biosafety regulations and guidelines determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specifics about their guidelines can be found on their biosafety page .
E. According to the WHO Biosafety Manual, what is the BioSafety Level rating of your lab?
The BioSafety Level of our lab is category 2. The lab room used is equipped to deal with category 2 hazards; for example, it contains a fume hood. However, for this project, only category 1 cells were used; namely, non-pathogenic E. coli and yeast.
