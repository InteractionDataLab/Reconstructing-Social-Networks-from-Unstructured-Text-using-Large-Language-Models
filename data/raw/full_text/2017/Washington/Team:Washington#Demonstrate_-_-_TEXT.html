Demonstrations
Because engineered organisms cannot be brought to the competition and our yeast are still in development, we are working on a demonstration of our closed-loop system using colored pH indicators as a proxy for the violacein system.
We have ran some preliminary tests to make sure that our color sensor is working. Using different concentrations of colored dyes in solution, we have shown that the color sensor is working as expected with the software we have written.

We are currently working on:
Fine-turning our turbidity sensor
Fine-tuning our syringe motors for functional use
Testing our hardware system with pH indicators
We hope to post on our Facebook page once we get our system running. Also, please visit our exhibit space at the Jamboree to see it in action!
