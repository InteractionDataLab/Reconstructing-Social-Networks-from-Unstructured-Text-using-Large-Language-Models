InterLab
Overview
Since 2014, the iGem Measurement Committee has been searching for a means to make measurements for Green Fluorescent Protein repeatable anywhere. The InterLab study aims to allow the Measurement Committee explore ways to improve the measurement procedures for GFP that can be repeated in any lab anywhere.
For the fourth InterLab, teams were provided with highly detailed transformation and measurement protocols, as well as six test devices (BBa_J364000, BBa_J364001, BBa_J364002, BBa_J364003, BBa_J364004, BBa_J364005) and both a positive (BBa_I20270) and a negative (BBa_R0040) control. Parts are located in the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone and carried chloramphenicol resistance. All plasmids were transformed into E.coli DH5-alpha cells

Cell Measurements
Materials:
Competent Cells (Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha)
LB media
Chloramphenicol (stock concentration 25 mg/mL dissolved in EtOH, working stock 25 μg/mL)
50 mL Falcon tubes covered in foil
Incubator at 37°C
Devices from InterLab Measurement Kit
Positive Control: BBa_I20270
Negative Control: BBa_R0040
Test Device 1: BBa_J364000
Test Device 2: BBa_J364001
Test Device 3: BBa_J364002
Test Device 4: BBa_J364003
Test Device 5: BBa_J364004
Test Device 6: BBa_J364005
Methods:
Each of the plasmids listed above were located on Plate 6 of the distribution kit and resuspended in 10 μL of dH₂O
Each device was transformed into 50 μL of competent cells
Transformations were plated onto an agar plate with chloramphenicol and grown overnight
On Day 2, 2 colonies were picked from each plate and inoculated in 10 mL of LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL Falcon tubes covered with foil. These cultures were grown overnight in an incubator at 37°C and 220 rpm.
On Day 3, 100 μL of each culture was pipetted into a 96 well plate for an OD600 reading, which was then used for the Dilution Calculations in the Excel sheet provided by iGEM
Each culture was diluted to a target OD of 0.02 following the preloading culture and media volumes calculated by the Dilution excel sheet (see OD Readings and Dilutions Calculations in the Results section below) in 10 mL of LB media + chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tubes wrapped in foil
Cultures were placed in incubator at 37°C and 220 rpm                4 replicates of 100 μL samples were taken from each culture and held on ice at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation before being placed in a 96 well plate for OD and fluorescence measurements using the setup described above.
