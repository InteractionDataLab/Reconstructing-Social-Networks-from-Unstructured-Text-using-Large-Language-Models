Wetlab
Introduction
The Washington iGEM wetlab team is in charge of the molecular biology side of the project. We developed a dCas9-sgRNA system designed to be inducible in yeast. Taking advantage of the violacein pathway as a proxy, we produced different colors to track metabolic activity. We also created and characterized Biobricks as well as Interlab.

gRNA Expression
We used the CRISPR/dCas9 system to regulate the violacein pathway in yeast using inducible promoters.
Design
Our team encountered multiple design constraints in the violacein pathway and ultimately found that the CRISPR/dCas9 system paired with sgRNAs controlled by the promoters ZAP1 and CUP1 was the most effective method.
InterLab
This year, our team successfully completed InterLab.
BioBricks
We created yeast promoter BioBricks!
Conclusion
This season, Washington iGEMâ€™s new wetlab team had a productive summer and fall. Having received an influx of new members we happily trained and worked hard alongside one another. For our main project, we were able to create the sgRNA expression system and successfully integrated it in yeast. We created and characterized two novel inducible promoter biobricks for yeast. Additionally, for the first time ever, we were able to participate in the iGEM 2017 Interlab collaboration alongside other iGEM teams across the globe.
