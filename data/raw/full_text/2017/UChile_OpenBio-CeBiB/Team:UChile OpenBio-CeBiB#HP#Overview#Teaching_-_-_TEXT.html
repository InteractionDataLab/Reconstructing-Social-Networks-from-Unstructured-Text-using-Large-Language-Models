The challenges of science in Chile are mainly to be valued and taken into account by people. Our country invests around 0,4% of its GDP in science, a percentage that is far away from the developed countries. Moreover, given the natural and geographical characteristics of our land, we are living on what is called “Outdoor Laboratory”. So we the scientist and university students must encourage the youth to make science and change the way Chileans look at it.

Because of these sad realities and to not stand with crossed arms, we decided to participate in school activities when they visited science fairs and the university. Our public has been from children to high school students, from public schools as much as private schools, hoping we could contribute in a simple, active and effective way in the formation of young thinkers and scientist. Some of our activities were DNA extraction, what is and how synthetic biology work (based on iGEM OpenBio-Team workshops) and some talks on how to start a bio-entrepreneurship in Chile.
