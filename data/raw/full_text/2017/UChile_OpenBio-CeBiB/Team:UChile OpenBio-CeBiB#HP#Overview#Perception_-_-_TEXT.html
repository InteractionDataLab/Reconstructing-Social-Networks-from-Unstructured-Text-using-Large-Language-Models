Chilean's perception of pollution
Click here to return to HP Overview
As our project continued advancing we didn't feel there was a real aproach to what people actually think and believe. So we designed 2 surveys, one online and the other one face-to-face, in order to know what our fellow citizens are thinking of pollution, science and scientific opportunities in Chile. The surveys were very short and asked 3 important details:
1) Is pollution one of the Chile's main problems?
2) Who is mainly responsible for the pollution?
3) Is Greenhardtii Project useful?
Hoping it would be representative, the surveys were done for a month (reaching aprox 700 people). We got answers mainly from young people (15-25 years old), because of the social media. You can find our conclutions in Silver Page .
