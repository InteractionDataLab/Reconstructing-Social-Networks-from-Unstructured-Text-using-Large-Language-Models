Biosafety
As a team, we are worried about the safety of each one of the members in the lab, that's why we made an exhaustive research, and trainings were done for all the members who worked in these spaces. Also, a search of the risk level of each microorganism was done, and it was found that E. coli and C. reinhardtii are in the lowest level, and according to the iGEM classification, both are in level 1, this means that they are not able to cause disease in adults.  The security measures implemented in the lab were:
Use of latex gloves
Use of cote
If it is necessary, work in the laminar flow cabinet.
Working in the lab!
