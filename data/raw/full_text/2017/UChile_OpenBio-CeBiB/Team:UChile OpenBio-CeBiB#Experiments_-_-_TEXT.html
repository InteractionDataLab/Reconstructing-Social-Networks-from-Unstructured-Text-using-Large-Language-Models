Procedure
The main objetives of this project, at first instance, is to develope a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain that is able to fix more quantities of CO2 and, at second instance, once got the ability, produce recombinant proteins that the other strains are not capable to do. On the other hand, the second aim is to characterized kineticallyan adjustable promoter for vitamin B12, which was nicely shared by Dr. Alisson Smith.
That is why, our team has been working on an experimental method that is explained in the next figure:
