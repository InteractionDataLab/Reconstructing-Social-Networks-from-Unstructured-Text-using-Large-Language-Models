Finally, he talked us about Myra Chávez, a postdoc and an expert working with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, who could share with us transformation plasmids, and other materials.
Discussion about the answers made in the las meeting and the mathematical model
Week 37 [06/26/17]
We achieved to make contact with Myra Chávez, who offered us help to solve some problems and she kindly gave us pBC1-CrGFP. From now on, Myra became a big help and support for our team and we nicknamed her as Maymi.
Week 38 [07/03/17]
Modellating meeting, looking for the parameters from Brenda
We launched our crowdfunding video! you can watch it if you like
Our first and longer collaboration started with iGEM Pasteur
Week 39 [07/10/17]
Meeting to work in the sequences that must be sent to print, define, and analyze. We also searched the tools of optimization of codons for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to make the first order to IDT.
Meeting with Lucho :D , Some modellating problems are solved and was proposed for the next meeting, have the most efficient promoter
Week 40 [07/17/17]
We improved the genetic circuit. Maymi accepted to be part of the team.
Find out that it is almost impossible to synthesize bacterial cellulose, K.O. cellulose production :(

Week 47 [09/04/17]
Amplification of pBC1-CrGFP in E. coli DH10B chemically competent.
Repetition of the last lab. Because there was no growth on the plate, the amplification was repeated. However, now the transformation was made in the E. coli top 10 chemically competent strains with more care and caution. After a thermic shock and incubation TB medium for an hour and a half, the cells were transfered to several plates with LB and ampicillin, and they were left incubating at 37°C.
The plates were checked and there actually was presence of transformant colonies with resistance to ampicillin, two of them were inoculated in Falcon tubes with LB and ampicillin medium at 37°C.
Miniprep of the transformants colonies in Falcon. Isolation of the plasmid pBC1-CrGFP.
First aproach to design our poster!!!
Week 48 [09/11/17]
Test transformation of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by method of glass beads with pBC1-CrGFP. We also learnt to cell count on a Neubauer camera. After the transformation the cells were left incubating in Falcon tubes with TAPS medium in dark during the night at room temperature with agitation.
Continuing with the last lab. The cells were incubated in TAPS, then they were centrifuged and sowed in plates with TAPS medium with agar and paromomycin. They were left incubating at ambient temperature.
Week 49 [09/18/17]
Meeting in the Energy Ministry
Week 50 [09/25/17]
