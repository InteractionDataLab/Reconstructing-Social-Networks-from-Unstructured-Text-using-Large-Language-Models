Results of the third restriction test
Superior gel. It is indicated with (N 째) the colony from which the plasmid comes. Staircase of 1 kB. Nomenclature: Part-N 째 of colony-Plasmid to which the part is bound (Lig plasmid)
Lower gel. It is indicated with (N 째) the colony from which the plasmid comes. Staircase of 1 kB. Nomenclature: Part-N 째 of colony-Plasmid to which the part is bound (Lig plasmid).
