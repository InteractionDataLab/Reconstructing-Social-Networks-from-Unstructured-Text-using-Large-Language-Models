Workshops and Talks
One of the pillars of OpenBio group, were all of us participate is to teach in an amusing and effective way to common citizens.
We are continuously preparing workshops related to synthetic biology, DNA extraction and teaching how to build a transilluminator.
We have also made talks about molecular biology concepts and bio-entrepreneurship projects in schools, scientific fairs and engineering and technologies festivals. In total we have reached and audience of almost 300 children and young students.

“Do your own Bioreactor” Competition
During the Biotechnological and Chemical Engineering Week (October 2017) we taught to the freshmen about what a reactor is and how they work. After that, we showed to them the microalgae in the microscope and their function. And to finish the activity we asked them to draw how they imagine a bio-reactor. Download them here.
Infographics
Once we started our Project we decided to create a fan page in Facebook called Greenhardtii Project , where we uploaded information every week. The objective of this page is to teach and motivate all the community about biotechnology. We got more than 500 followers!!
Among the information published, we included data about our project, some basic biological concepts as photosynthesis or what a microalga is. We had such a success, that the use of microalgae was included in the studies and as laboratory elements in two subjects Microbiology and Cellular Biology of the Civil Engineering in Biotechnology career in University of Chile.
On the other hand, we received a lot of collaboration from the followers, and we made several contests and where the prices were a Chlamydomonas amigurumi.
