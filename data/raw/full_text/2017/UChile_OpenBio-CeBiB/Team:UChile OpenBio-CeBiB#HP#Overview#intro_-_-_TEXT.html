Spreading the project: From selection to its exposition

Choosing an iGEM project is not an easy labour, especially when you lack resources, which is the case of Chile. That’s why projects must be analyzed and reviewed by the community and the academic body to choose the most promising and achievable idea. In our case, we participated exposing 5 projects on the 3rd Festival of Engineering and Science of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (FCFM) of the University of Chile, where the public that attended (neighbours, students and families) voted on after a conversation with us.
Presentations during the Festival
Once the main idea of the project was chosen, which was a bio catalytic converter for cars, we started to put together a proposal which was explain to people in every public space that we could participate in, science fairs on the street, the Chemical and Biotechnology Engineering Week and even on the radio show “I want to be a scientist” being interviewed by two Middle school students about our project and ideas. So we picked up many ideas, we even changed the bio catalytic converter idea to a photobioreactor!!, and we got encouraged to continue with our work.
