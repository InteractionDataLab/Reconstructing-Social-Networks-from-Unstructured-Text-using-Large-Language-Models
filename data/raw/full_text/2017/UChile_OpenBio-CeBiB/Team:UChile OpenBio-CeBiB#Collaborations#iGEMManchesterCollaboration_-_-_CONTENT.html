They made a series of questions about regulations for the correct manipulation of GMOs, and different teams have answered them, depending on which country they are from.</P><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.</P><P>On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.</P><P>In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.</P><P>The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. Competent authorities in the European Union and The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety in Indonesia have similar roles.</P><P>Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.</P><P>In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:
<LI>Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.</LI><LI>Identify the level of risk.</LI><LI>Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.</LI><LI>Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.</LI><LI>Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.</LI><LI>Good hygiene of workers.</LI><LI>Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.</LI><LI>Waste disposal protocols, among others.</LI></P><P>In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.</P><P>In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">As a consumer, how do I know if a product I want to buy contains GMO?</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>The legal requirements for disclosing GMOs within food and other products differ across the world. Some countries within the Americas have little to no laws in place regarding GMO labelling. In the USA, there are no official obligations for companies to label any products containing GMOs. The same applies to Canada, unless the food is likely to pose a health or safety risk to consumers, in which case full disclosure of GMOs is mandatory. The Brazilian government, which has until now required companies to label transgenic products with a T symbol, is (as of 2017) currently considering removing this law. Chilean government might be a notable exception as it prohibits the introduction into the market of any products containing GMOs.</P><P>In contrast, most of Europe, Asia and Oceania have strict guidelines surrounding labelling of GMO products. The European Union, Australia, India and Indonesia all require the packaging of such products to be bear the label “this product contains genetically modified organisms”, although exceptions do exist in the form of medical products (in the European Union) and foods produced by animals fed with GMO foods (in Australia). Japan and Korea follow a percentage scale, with GMO labelling required if a product contains more than 5% and 1% genetically-modified ingredients respectively.</P></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">What are the most important documents related to GMMs?</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>The documents related to GMM concern a wide range of issues like Manufacturing, Transportation, Safety, Environment, Health, etc.</P><P>When it comes to Biosafety, places like European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, India, and Indonesia clearly have got laws and regulations concerning biosafety and documents are supposed to be submitted in this regard. US and Canada do not seem to have any separate regulation regarding biosafety. However, in the US, Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology (1986) ensures the safety of the public.</P><P>For GMMs products (food, drugs, cosmetics etc.), places like the European Union, United state, India, and Canada have a policy and law for the use and regulation of GMM products. To use GMM products in these countries, the government formalities should be done before use, as stated in their laws and policies. In Brazil, there is a registry for biological products. In Japan and Korea there is no such law for GMM products. In Indonesia, supplementary documents must be submitted to use GMM biological foods and products. In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.</P><P>In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seem to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.</P><P>The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.

What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?</B></H5><UL style="font-size:20px;" style="font-color:green"><P id="p1eu"><LI><B>European Union</B></LI></P><P>European Commission is the institution responsible for proposing and implementing legislations applying to all member countries. Member countries may additionally restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMMs in their territory. This possibility, however, is regulated by Directive (EU) 2015/412 adopted by the EU.</P><LI><B>United States</B><P>Stemming from research from the University of Virginia and EMBO, the J. Craig Ventor Policy Center Team has concluded that the United States lack an agency that specifically focuses on enforcing laws regarding GMMs. Instead, legislation such as the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology and the President's Commission for studying Bio-ethical issues, which was established by Barack Obama. As of now, the regulatory agency with the most regulatory control on issues regarding synthetic biology is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).</P></LI><LI><B>Australia</B><P>In Australia, the use of GMMs is regulated under a nationwide legislative framework consisting of two main branches: the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Individual states and territories also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.</P></LI><LI><B>Brazil</B><P>In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules and fiscalisation of GMMs and its derivatives in the national territory. The National Technical Committee of Biosafety (CTNBio) is responsible for enforcing the laws and setting the rules for the construction, experimentation, cultivation, manipulation, transport, commercialization, consumption, release and discarding of GMMs and its derivatives.</P></LI><LI><B>Japan</B><P>In Japan, mainly Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the use of GMMs. With these ministries at the core, other institutions such as Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare are also responsible for GMMs in each related field.</P></LI><LI><B>Chile</B><P>Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology. However, the Agricultural and Livestock Service is responsible for the importation, sowing and propagation of GMOs, also regulating the exportation of seeds (Law N° 3.557/82 actualised Law N°1523/2001). The Ministry of Health, on the other hand, regulates the labelling of food made with the use of GMOs (Article 107).</P></LI><LI><B>Indonesia</B><P>The laws regarding the use of GMMs are regulated by 4 ministries: The Ministry of Agriculture, The Ministry of Forestry and Plantation, The Ministry of Health, and The Ministry of Food and Horticulture. They created the Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 21 year of 2005 (PP No. 21/2005) on Biosafety of GMO.</P></LI><LI><B>Korea</B><P>The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the GMO Law, established on Jan 28, 2001. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy takes charge of this law.</P></LI><LI><B>India</B><P>India is currently undergoing a massive overhaul in their laws and regulations regarding GMOs. Currently, there is a proposed “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017’ draft that has been prepared and opened for comments. Currently, under the proposal, the following 6 bodies are in charge of enforcing laws regarding GMOs and GMMs:</P></LI><LI>Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RDAC) - Advisory</LI><LI>Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) - Regulatory/ Approval</LI><LI>Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) - Regulatory/ Approval</LI><LI>Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) - Regulatory/ Approval</LI><LI>State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC) - Regulatory/ Approval</LI><LI>Monitoring District Level Committee (DLC) - Monitoring</LI><LI><B>Canada</B><P>In accordance with Foods and Drugs Act, Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada are the administrative branches responsible for the regulation of products derived from biotechnology. Health Canada’s role is to enforce standards for safety and nutritional quality of all foods sold in Canada. It works under the Foods and Drugs Act. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) role is to minimize diseases and other public health hazards that could potentially be caused by the food supply system. Fisheries and Oceans Canada role is to regulate Canadian fisheries, oceans and freshwater resources. This joint effort helps ensure that informed decisions regarding GMMs by pooling the expertise and considerations of each agency together.</P></LI></UL><H5><B>2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?</B></H5><UL style="font-size:20px;" style="font-color:green"><LI><B>European Union</B><P>All member countries are obliged to establish ’competent authorities,’ institutions responsible for overseeing the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis.</P></LI><LI><B>United States</B><P>The US Food and Drug Administration regulates any GMMs that get used in consumer products, such as GMMs in food or cosmetics. The US Department of Agriculture regulates any genetic modification of plants. However, any GMMs that are to be released into the environment are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P></LI><LI><B>Australia</B><P>It is the role of the Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee to assess all data supplied by any applicant (who is intending to release GMMs into the environment) and perform a comprehensive literature review to determine whether or not it will be approved. FSANZ also regulates the use of GMMs in foods for human consumption on an individual case-by-case basis.</P></LI><LI><B>Brazil</B><P>The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa) approves and inspects the use of GMMs and its derivatives in any products for human use (e.g., pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food). The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Supply (MAPA) is responsible for regulating the use of modified seeds and plants. All GMMs must be approved for release by CTNBio.</P></LI><LI><B>Japan</B><P>In Japan, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and Ministry of the Environment regulate the use of GMMs on research and development. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment regulate the use of GMMs that are agricultural produce. Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and Ministry of the Environment regulate the use of GMMs that are pharmaceuticals for human body.</P><P>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology regulates the gene recombination experiments. Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry regulates the use of GMMs on a production of enzymes for industrial use. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries regulates the use of GMMs on a production or sale of experimental animals.</P></LI><LI><B>Chile</B><P>Environment Ministry regulates crops for production with environmental impact service (SEA) (Law N° 19.300/1994). The Health Ministry has a specific regulation for food and drinks. For the propagation of any GMO, the Agricultural and Livestock Service is in charge.</P></LI><LI><B>Indonesia</B><P>On a case-by-case basis, it is regulated by a specific non-ministry government institution The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety on 5 different fields: foods, plants, animals, fishes, and microorganisms. They review all the required technical documents and inform whether or not it is needed to do a follow-up laboratory test and so on.</P></LI><LI><B>Korea</B><P>The committee of the Biosafety is the umbrella body for other GMO supervising ministries. With the help of the Korea Biosafety Clearing House (KBCH), which is the information center, each Ministry takes care of case falling under their supervision. For instance, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning is in charge of the academical usages of GMOs.</P></LI><LI><B>India</B><P>As per the proposed “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017’’, the following has been proposed:</P><P>Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) [formerly known as Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), has been established under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&amp;CC). The major functions of GEAC as prescribed in the Rules 1989 are:</P></LI><LI>To appraise activities involving large scale use of hazardous microorganisms and recombinants in research and industrial production from the environmental angle.</LI><LI>To appraise proposals relating to release of genetically engineered organisms and products into the environment including experimental field trials.</LI><LI>The committee or any persons authorized by it has powers to take punitive action under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.</LI><P>The SBCC is a monitoring committee at State level and it shall have powers:</P><P><OL><LI>To inspect, investigate and to take punitive action in case of violations of statutory provisions through the State Pollution Control Board or the Directorate of Health etc.</LI><LI>To review periodically the safety and control measures in various institutions handling GE Organisms.</LI><LI>To act as nodal agency at State level to assess the damage, if any, due to release of GE Organisms and to take on site control measures.</LI></OL></P><P>There shall be a District Level Biotechnology Committee (DLC) in the districts wherever necessary under the District Collectors to monitor the safety regulations in installations engaged in the use of genetically modified organisms/ hazardous microorganisms and its applications in the environment.</P><P>The District Level Committee/or any other person/s authorized in this behalf shall visit the installation engaged in activity involving genetically engineered organisms, hazardous microorganisms, formulate information chart, find out hazards and risks associated with each of these installations and coordinate activities with a view to meeting any emergency. They shall also prepare an off-site emergency plan. The District Level Committee shall regularly submit its report to the SBCC/ GEAC.</P><LI><B>Canada</B><P>Manufacturers wishing to make their products available in Canada are required to submit paperwork (including manufacturing and quality control methodologies, pre-clinical and clinical tests, side effects and limitation), as well multiple samples in the case of biologics, to Health Canada. Health Canada will then evaluate the product according to the regulations set out in the Food and Drugs Act, the Food and Drugs Regulations, and the Medical Devices Regulations.</P></LI></UL><H5><B>3. What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?</B></H5><UL style="font-size:20px;" style="font-color:green"><LI><B>European Union</B><P><B>A.</B> If your business involves contained use of GMMs:</P></LI><LI>Run a risk assessment</LI><LI>Assign an appropriate risk class to your activity</LI><LI>Notify the competent authority about your planned use</LI><LI>Follow the safety measures which apply to the risk class identified</LI><P>For more details, read Directive 2009/41/EC.</P><P><B>B.</B> If your business involves releasing GMOs into the environment:</P><P><OL><LI>Run a risk assessment</LI><LI>Notify the competent authority about your planned use</LI><LI>After completion of a release, send to the competent authority the result of the release in respect of any risk to human health or the environment</LI><LI>Notify the competent authority about your product placement on the market</LI><LI>Following the placing on the market of a GMO as or in a product, ensure that monitoring and reporting on it are carried out according to the conditions specified in the consent.</LI></OL></P><P>For more details, read Directive 2001/18/EC.</P><P><B>C.</B> If your business involves selling or producing genetically modified food or feed:</P><P><OL><LI>Apply to a competent authority supplying them with relevant information</LI><LI>Follow appropriate labelling guidelines once you have received the authorisation</LI></OL></P><P>For more details, read Regulation (EC) 1829/2003.</P><P><B>D.</B> If the product you want to sell inside the EU includes GMO:</P><P><OL><LI>Inform trade buyers in writing that a product contains GMOs (or provide a ‘declaration of use’ for products intended for food or animal feed).</LI><LI>Communicate the unique identifiers assigned to each GMO under the regulation.</LI><LI>Identify each ingredient produced from GMOs, if an ingredients list exists (for food and feed).</LI>
This information should be provided at every stage in the production and distribution chain and kept for 5 years.
</OL></P><P>For more details, read Regulation (EC) 1830/2003.</P><P><B>E.</B> Finally, check if the country in which you plan to start your business, does not have additional restrictions. You should contact the competent authority operating in your country before you commit any capital.</P><LI><B>United States</B><P>Under FDA regulations, most plant GMOs are considered equivalent to non-GMOs and do not require much further approval. However, if the modified plant expresses a protein that is significantly different from any protein it originally expressed, then the business must get approval from the FDA.</P><P>To receive EPA approval for GMOs with the Bt toxin, the business must conduct a food-safety analysis and verify that the toxin will be safe for the environment. GMOs without this toxin can be freely used.
</P></LI><LI><B>Australia</B><P>Prior to any use of a GMM, a business must first obtain a license from the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator. This process involves providing detailed information about the host, donor, transferred DNA, properties of the GMM and where it will be grown. A formal risk assessment is then carried out by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator who then make a decision as to whether a license will be granted.</P></LI><LI><B>Brazil</B><P>In order to use a GMM in your business, one needs to fulfill numerous requirements. The development of any GMM must be monitored by the CTNBio and the regulatory agencies. If your company is going to start working with GMM, the first step is getting the Certified of Biosafety by CTNBio and create an internal committee of biosafety. Then, you need the approval by the regulatory agency (e.g. Anvisa for human purposes and the MAPA for agriculture purposes). You are going to need to fulfill a lot of requirements in order to get the registry and the permission to develop your research in your lab. 
For agriculture purposes, once you have finished your research inside the lab, the CTNBio will evaluate it and emit a position paper that will allow you to do a planned and controlled release. To do that, you are going to need to fulfill the requirements of the Normative Resolution n. 6 of November 6th, 2008.</P><P>For medical purposes, once you finished your research inside the lab, you are going to need to ask Anvisa for a registry of biological medication and you are going to need to fulfill all of the requirements stared in the Resolution n. 55 of December 16th, 2010.</P><P>Once your product is registered and approved by CTNBio and MAPA or Anvisa, you will be able to release and/or commercialise it.</P></LI><LI><B>Japan</B><P><B>A.</B> If you use GMMs in an open system (e.g. agriculture use, bioremediation use):
In the use of open system, first, you have to apply for the approval of use regulations with the evaluation sheet of biodiversity influence to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment. Once you got approval, you can start using GMMs. At the same time, you have to report the results of the information collected after using GMMs. And you will also get site inspections by Ministries written above as well as independent administrative institutions (FAMIC, NARO, NLBC, FRA). As a result, you will get administrative orders and you have to follow these order by re-submitting information or change/annulment of the use regulations.</P><P><B>B.</B> If you use GMMs in closed system (e.g. using GMMs for production of enzymes/catalysts, using GMMs for production of reagents/ industrial materials):
If you use GMMs inside faculties and prevent GMMs to diffuse, first you have to check if the GMM you're using is on the GILSP list. If it is on the list, you have to follow the steps to prevent diffusions that are prescribed and start using GMMs. Then, you have to report using situations and you will get inspections and orders. If the GMM is not on the GILSP list, you have to fill in a diffusion prevention measures sheet and send it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Once those measures are approved, you will follow the same steps above.</P></LI><LI><B>Chile</B><P>It is forbidden to commercialise GMOs, the only way to establish a business with them is to export seeds.

Risk group 1 includes any biological materials that are potentially pathogenic to humans or animals, but are very unlikely to be so, or are not pathogenic at all. Some recommendations for CL1 facilities outlined in the Canadian Biosafety Standard are as follows:</P></LI><LI>The designated areas for handling biological materials should be separated from public areas and administrative work areas.</LI><LI>There should be designated hand and eye wash stations appropriate for facility operations.</LI><LI>Appropriate personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses, lab coats and, footwear covering the feet, must be worn.</LI><LI>Only authorized personnel and visitors should be allowed in the facility.</LI><LI>Waste materials must be disposed in the proper containers and wastes that came into contact with biological materials must be decontaminated before disposal.</LI><LI>Proper hand washing techniques must be employed after coming into contact with biological materials.</LI><LI>Procedures must incorporate proper aseptic technique and minimizes contamination and the formation of aerosols.</LI><LI>Food and drinks should be prohibited from the lab.</LI><LI>Personnel must be trained for the safe handling and storing of biological materials to protect them.</LI><LI>Safety guidelines must be kept up-to-date.</LI><P>To work with biological materials in higher risk groups (2, 3, and 4), in addition to adopting the appropriate containment level, a Pathogen and Toxin Licence must be obtained from PHAC. Although CL1 provides the foundational biosafety guidelines for these containment levels, further requirements must be followed to minimize contamination and hazards to personnel working with high risk group pathogens.

As part of our Integrated Human Practices, we will be creating a potential business model for our bacterium. This GMM Legislation Doc will help us massively in deciding where our potential business could be most easily set up from a legal point of view.</P></LI><LI><B>United States</B><P>Our project focuses on improving the wastewater treatment process. As such, knowing what legislation within the United States regulates the use of GMOs within the environment and with products such as drinking water is important if we wanted to make our project usable outside the laboratory. </P></LI><LI><B>Australia</B><P>The Macquarie University iGEM team is researching the use of genetically modified e-coli to produce hydrogen gas as a sustainable, zero-emission fuel source. Our prototype is an at-home refueling station that utilizes our technology to enable drivers of hydrogen-powered vehicles to refuel their vehicle at home. This document will be very helpful in developing our business plan as it will guide our decisions about consumer perceptions of GMO’s, laws that we need to consider and authoritative bodies that we will need to approach should we decide to produce and sell our product in overseas markets.</P></LI><LI><B>Brazil</B><P>Our project is to develop a new treatment for type 1 diabetes using a genetically engineered probiotic bacteria, which means that to this project became a real product someday, it would have to go under several safety assessments and approved to be used in humans.
Over this year, as we worked in our project, we were always worried about the legal requirements for a GMO like ours become a real product and how biosafety laws affect and guide the development of new GMOs. This document was very useful to us to research and understand the laws of our country, and also other countries, the steps that we would have to take if we wanted our project to became a product. It was also very important to know the laws of other countries and see how GMOs are seen around the world.</P></LI><LI><B>Japan</B><P>Our team is working on creating E.coli that can fix nitrogen. As our future vision, we are thinking of commercializing those GMMs by putting nitrogen-fixing GMMs into capsule. By taking this GMMs, we can help babies under 1000 days suffer from malnutrition comes from low intake of proteins. So, this GMM Legislation Doc will help us when thinking how we can actually commercialize.</P></LI><LI><B>Chile</B><P>As a team, we have realised that in comparison with other countries, ours stands out due to the lack of regulations for GMO and GMM. This situation, harm us as researchers, scientists and community, in two ways. Firstly, working with GMM might be dangerous as no safety guidelines have been established. Secondly, no research is done. Both options result in a danger to society, the lack of biosafety, and a delay in scientific research for biotechnology.</P><P>According to this analysis, we have thought of introducing a debate into the community about the implementation of regulations for GMM. We have also considered suggesting the creation of protocols and laws for the GMO and GMM to the institutions in charge of the GMO regulations, such as Agricultural and Livestock Service and Environment Ministry. This could imply an increase in area-related startups, along with scientific advancement and a more informed and conscious society about biotechnology in general.</P></LI><LI><B>Indonesia</B><P>ITB's iGEM Project or Dewaruci is tackling the environment issue specifically the microplastic. We are designing a bacteria that could degrade micro-plastic on the open ocean. It means that we are going to release the GMO's to the environment. This document possibly could provide the regulation information for the future worldwide implementation of our project which may lead to more innovation and development of the project itself.</P></LI><LI><B>Korea</B><P>By chance, our project of this year is directly related to the regulation of the GMM since it would be the actual GMM product if we complete our project and try to materialize them. Our project this year was to make an edible probiotics, which is considerably regulated by the government’s control for they  directly interact with one’s biosystem.  Rather than simply considering the GMM regulation of Korea, proceeding a collaboration project with various other teams  gave us the knowledge and insight about the biosafety which helped us a lot in many aspects while we proceeded our annual project. And it was pleasure to consider in what way can an iGEM project change the society.</P><P>The act of investigating also lead us to an unusual chance. A contact with a member of the GMM regulating-institution, in order to get informations required to fill in questions of this document, gave us a chance to meet the member of National Assembly, who mainly take charge of enacting GMM law.</P></LI><LI><B>India</B><P>As a part of foundational advance, this year our team is working on a square wave generator with applications in varied fields. Seeing the potential it has to revolutionize the field of periodic drug delivery and biological clocks, the GMM regulations will be a great source of help to commercialize the iGEM project with the rules laid down for business across the globe, guiding through the best place for setup. Also, the import and export of GMMs across countries, for iGEM projects as well as business, would then be easily guided with minimized issues in the customs and thus their timely delivery.

For our education outreach, we are developing modules on scientific literacy and producing a video on the importance of Alberta’s science curriculum in providing a foundation for the future. An element in our modules for high school students may introduce biotechnologies, including GMO’s, and international legislations regulating the use of these biotechnologies. We are also starting an official student group at the University of Alberta dedicated to discussing and understanding the overarching reach of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Documents like these put to perspective the concerns associated with genetic modification of organisms.</P></LI></UL></DIV><BUTTON class="accordion"><H5 align="center">Discussion</H5></BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><P>As a final comment, we wanted to reflect on the principles standing behind any GMM related legislations: ensuring citizens’ safety. As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous projects, thus helping solve environmental, medical and nutritional problems.
