Biological triplicates of <SPAN class="bacterium">E. coli</SPAN> Nissle 1917 transformed with a plasmid coding for an AHL-inducible promoter that controls the expression of bacterioferritin and GFP and a plasmid coding for LuxR (Figure 2) were transferred in a 96-well plate and induced with twelve different concentrations of AHL (from 0 to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M).

The concentration of AHL needed for full induction of the system was calculated based on fluorescence measurements and the assumption that bacterioferritin is co-expressed alongside GFP upon activation of P<SUB>Lux</SUB> (Figure 3).

To test whether overexpression of bacterioferritin leads to a detectable signal change in an MRI scanner, bacteria are grown in iron supplemented medium, induced with AHL and imaged in an MRI scanner.</P><P><B>PROCEDURE</B>
Biological triplicates of <SPAN class="bacterium">E. coli</SPAN> Nissle 1917 transformed with bacterioferritin (Figure 2) were grown in four different experimental conditions (with and without induction and with and without iron supplementation) and imaged in a 4.7 T small animal MRI scanner. T2 maps and T2-weighted images were generated since iron bound to bacterioferritin converts from its ferrous to ferric state and becomes paramagnetic, which results in shortening of the transverse (T2) relaxation time in MRI. <A href="#bib1” class=" forward-ref=""> [1]</A><SPAN class="bacterium">E. coli</SPAN> MG1655 (DE3) (T7lacO-<I>bfr</I>), transformed with an IPTG-inducible promoter that controls bacterioferritin expression, was used as a positive control. Additionally, a <I>bfr</I>-knockout <I>E. coli</I> K-12 from the Keio collection was included into the experiment to see how much the endogenous bacterioferritin contributes to the signal when the bacteria are grown in the presence of iron. A detailed protocol is available in <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Protocols">Protocols.</A></P><P><B>RESULTS</B>
Bound to bacteriferritin, iron is in its paramagnetic ferric state which shortens the T2 relaxation time in the area, and result in a visible signal drop in the T2-weighted image. <A href="#bib1” class=" forward-ref=""> [1]</A> Both of these effects, shortening of the T2 relaxation time (Table 1, Figure 6) and a visible change in the T2-weighted image (Figure 7) were experienced by the bacteria in this experiment that were grown in the presence of iron and induced to overexpress bacterioferritin.

MRI T2-weighted image of six samples in 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, transversal section. Samples 4 and 5 (both of bacteria grown in iron-supplemented medium and induced with AHL, T2 = 175 ms and T2 = 155 ms respectively) appear visibly darker than the rest. Sample 1 is pure PBS (T2 = 332 ms), sample 2 is PBS supplemented with ferric citrate (T2 = 316 ms), sample 3 is a <I>bfr</I>-knockout grown without iron supplementation (T2 = 343 ms), while sample 6 is T7lacO-<I>bfr</I>, also grown without iron supplementation (T2 = 326 ms).</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>All the bacteria were resuspended and imaged in PBS, after washing of the culture medium. To test if any unwashed iron could mask the signal, the T2 relaxation time of pure PBS was compared to PBS supplemented with iron. The results showed that the free iron in the medium only slightly changes the signal (T2 = 332 ms in PBS and T2 = 316 ms in iron-supplemented PBS) and should not interfere with the measurements (Figure 8).</P><P>As observed with other strains (Table 1), the <I>bfr</I>-knockout strain experienced a change in the signal when grown in an iron-supplemented medium, suggesting that even in the absence of bacterioferritin, other iron-storage systems present in the bacteria contribute to iron binding and background noise (Table 1, Figure 8).</P><FIGURE class="fig-nonfloat" style="width:500px;"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 8. Influence of iron on the T2 relaxation time. PBS supplemented with 150 µM of ferric citrate showed an insignificant change in the signal when compared to pure PBS. <I>bfr</I>-knockout experienced a drop in the signal when grown in an iron-supplemented medium.
 </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><B>CONCLUSION</B>We believe the results demonstrate the usability of bacterioferritin as an MRI contrast agent in vitro and confirms the potential to use it as an in vivo reporter of tumor sensing. All samples where bacterioferrition overexpression was induced and iron supplementation was provided showed a significant change in the signal, as expected. There was, however, a more modest level of signal change experienced by all bacteria grown in an iron-supplemented medium, which can probably be contributed to presence of various inherent bacterial iron-storage proteins, as the knockout experiments suggest. </P></SECTION><SECTION class="references"><H1>References</H1><OL><LI id="bib1">Hill, Philip J., et al. &quot;Magnetic resonance imaging of tumors colonized with bacterial ferritin-expressing Escherichia coli.&quot; <CITE>PLoS One</CITE> 6.10 (2011): e25409. <A href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025409">doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025409</A></LI></OL></SECTION></SECTION><FOOTER id="footerN"><BUTTON onclick="goto_top()" id="goto-top" title="Go to top">Top</BUTTON><A class="sponsor-a" href="/Team:ETH_Zurich/Sponsors">Sponsors</A></FOOTER></MAIN></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
