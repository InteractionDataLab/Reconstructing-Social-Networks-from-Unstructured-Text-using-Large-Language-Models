InterLab Study
The Challenge
How close can the numbers be when fluorescence is measured all around the world?
Reliable and reproducible measurements are the fundamentals of science. However, up until this day, the comparison of fluorescence data remains a big challenge in synthetic biology. The InterLab study is a collaboration of iGEM teams around the world with the goal of determining the accuracy and robustness of GFP fluorescence data and comparing results. By following a uniform protocol and recording the resulting fluorescence in absolute units and its variability, the InterLab Study is aiming to improve the measurement tools available to the synthetic biology community.
This year we characterized eight plasmids:
six test devices encoding GFP fused to different promoters and RBSs of different strength ( BBa_J364000 , BBa_J364001 , BBa_J364002 , BBa_J364003 , BBa_J364004 , BBa_J364005 )
a positive control ( BBa_I20270 )
a negative control ( BBa_R0040 )
After generating an OD600 reference point and a fluorescein standard curve, we transformed the test devices and measured the resulting fluorescence in a plate reader. Visit the iGEM InterLab Study page for more information.
Experiments
Experiment 1: OD600 Reference Point
OBJECTIVE
Use LUDOX-HS40 as a single point reference to obtain a ratiometric conversion factor to transform absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement.
MATERIALS
LUDOX-HS40 (Sigma Aldrich, Cat No 420816, Interlab Study Measurement Kit)
Distilled water (dH2O)
Greiner 96-well flat clear bottom black polystyrol plate (Greiner Bio One International GmbH, Germany)
Tecan Pro M1000 Plate Reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland)
METHODS
Add 100 uL of 100% LUDOX-HS40 in 4 wells
Add 100 uL of dH2O in 4 wells
Measure absorbance at 600 nm of all samples in standard measurement modes in instrument
MEASUREMENTS
Mode: absorbance
Wavelength: 600 nm
Number of flashes: 25
Settle time: 0 ms

Experiment 2: Fluorescein Fluorescence Standard Curve
OBJECTIVE
Generate a standard curve of fluorescence for fluorescein concentration. Use the standard curve to correct the cell based readings to an equivalent fluorescein concentration. This concentration can then be converted into a concentration of GFP.
MATERIALS
100 µM Fluorescein sodium salt (Sigma Aldrich, Cat No 46970, Interlab Study Measurement Kit)
1x PBS (phosphate buffered saline)
Greiner 96-well flat bottom black polystyrol plate (Greiner Bio One International GmbH, Germany)
Tecan Pro M1000 Plate Reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland)
METHODS
Add 100 µL of 1x PBS in the wells A2:C12.
Add 200 µL of 100 µM fluorescein sodium salt solution into the wells A1, B1, C1.
Create serial dilutions of fluorescein by transferring 100 µL of solution starting from wells A1, B1, C1 to A2, B2, C2 until A11, B11, C11 wells are filled. Discard the extra 100 µL from A11, B11, C11 .
Measure fluorescence of all samples in standard measurement modes in instrument.
MEASUREMENTS
Mode: fluorescence bottom reading
Excitation wavelength: 488 nm ± 5 nm
Emission wavelength: 509 nm ± 5 nm

50 mL Falcon tubes covered in foil (Greiner Bio One International GmbH, Germany)
Incubator (ClimoShaker ISFX-1, Adolf Kühner AG, Switzerland)
Greiner 96-well flat bottom black polystyrol plate (Greiner Bio One International GmbH, Germany)
Tecan Pro M1000 Plate Reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland)
METHODS
Day 1: Transform chemically competent K-12 DH5α E. coli with the following plasmids:
Positive control

Day 2: Pick two colonies from each plate and inoculate it on 5-10 mL LB medium + chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37 oC and 220 rpm.
Day 3: Measure OD600 of the overnight cultures. Dilute the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 12 mL LB medium + chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube. Incubate at 37 oC and 220 rpm. Take 500 µL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours of incubations. Measure OD and fluorescence.
