Modeling
When building a bacterial system meant to function in a more complex setting than in bulk in a test tube, modeling what would its behavior be in real conditions is key to aim for a credible development. Because the experimental conditions that were available to us to develop our system (in vitro experiments) were quite far from the actual situation (in vivo tumor colonization), a significant amount of work on the modeling was needed, particularly to implement the Tumor Sensor
With our model, we could make the link between what was happening during our in vitro experiments and what would correspondingly happen in the real case scenario in the tumor.
Model Map
Our project relied heavily on estimating the environment in which CATE operates, as well as the changes that it brings about after colonizing a tumor shell. The Model Map below is a rough outline of our efforts; click on it to explore our modelling in more detail!
