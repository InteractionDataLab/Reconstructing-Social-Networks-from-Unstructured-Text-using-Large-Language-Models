Overview
We divided our experiments into five categories corresponding to CATE's five functions (see Circuit ). We worked in parallel on individual functions and combined them together once they reached the desired behaviour.
Our work was planned in three phases (see Design ). In Phase I: Initial Design we choose and optimized DNA sequences for our parts based on literature research and planned assembly of the individual parts into test devices. The test devices were then used to develop working assays. In Phase II: Tests and Optimization, the assays thought us about how our functions behave. Based on this information, we could tune different parameters to optimize subsequent experiments. In Phase III: Demonstration of the Function, milestone experiments were performed with the optimized parameters to show our systems in action.
