Situated in the heart of Europe, yet forging connections all over the world, ETH Zurich is pioneering solutions to the global challenges of today and tomorrow. ETH Zurich is a science, technology, engineering and mathematics university in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. It has more than 19,000 students from over 120 different countries. Twenty-one Nobel Prizes have been awarded to students or professors of the Institute in the past, the most famous of whom was Albert Einstein.
The Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE)  unites biologists, engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians to work towards a quantitative understanding and purposeful engineering of complex biological. The integration of experiments, theory, and development of novel systems is what sets D-BSSE apart from other departments and makes it an attractive research environment.
Amgen is one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies and harnesses the powerful tools of cellular and molecular biology and medicinal chemistry to discover, develop and commercialize naturally occurring proteins, antibodies and small molecules. With your financial support, you facilitated our experiments and the set up of our lab. Thank you!
First released in 2005, Geneious is one the world’s leading bioinformatics software platforms. It is a very powerful and comprehensive suite of molecular biology tools, which enabled us to design and assemble all our DNA constructs. Thank you for providing each team member with a license!
Genscript is the world’s leading biotech company providing services and products such as gene synthesis, peptide, protein and preclinical drug development service capabilities. Thank you for awarding us the GenScript Scholarship and the great gene synthesis service!
