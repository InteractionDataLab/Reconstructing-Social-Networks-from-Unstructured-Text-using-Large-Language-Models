With this, our engineered bacteria would be able to autonomously decide if they are in tumor tissue or not. This decision is taken upon AND-logic integration of two inputs: AHL and lactate (figure 1). Only if both chemicals are present, the downstream modules are activated. To achieve such behaviour, we designed a synthetic promoter consisting of operators taken from <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1847007">BBa_K1847007</A>, part of the Lactate sensing system <A href="#bib4" class="forward-ref">[4]</A> and the <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_R0062">pLux</A> promoter, part of the quorum sensing system. This promoter is regulated by the two proteins <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1847001">LldR</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0062">LuxR</A>. LldR binds to the operators O1 and O2. This introducing a loop in the DNA that masks putative transcription factor binding sites. When lactate is present and binds to LldR, the protein undergoes a conformational change leading to release of the loop. When LuxR binds to AHL, it also undergoes a conformational change which leads to formation of LuxR homo-dimers that bind to the pLux sequence and recruit RNA polymerase whereby transcription is initiated. For a more thorough explanation visit the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Circuit/Fa_Tumor_Sensor">circuit page</A>.</P><FIGURE class="fig-nonfloat" style="width:700px;"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 1.

	<UL><LI>Phase I: We <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Experiments/Tumor_Sensor#phaseI">rationally designed</A> the genetic sequence of the hybrid promoter. To do so, we relied on work done by previous iGEM teams and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/parameter_space">let our model guide us</A> towards the most efficient design.</LI><LI>Phase II: We transformed <SPAN class="bacterium">E. Coli</SPAN> Nissle 1917 with plasmids containing only the quorum sensing system, grew single colonies to different densities and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Experiments/Tumor_Sensor#QS_end_point">evaluated their response</A>. With this experiment, we aimed to find the threshold density at which the quorum sensing system would be activated. The data <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/parameter_fitting">was also used to infer important parameters of the system</A> and thus guide further design. We found that we can modulate final population densities and that with the initial quorum sensing system (not in AND-gate context), the activation threshold lies at an OD of ~2.</LI><LI>We <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Experiments/Tumor_Sensor#AND_gate_wo_QS">evaluated the response</A> of our AND-gate designs to varying amounts of lactate and AHL. Based on this data we evaluated functionality of the rationally designed hybrid promoters and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/In_Silico_Final">determined the design most suitable to our system's needs</A>. We concluded that the hybrid promoter enables <I>E. coli</I> to differentiate lactate and AHL levels associated with healthy and tumor tissue.</LI><LI>Phase III: Finally, we transformed <SPAN class="bacterium">E. Coli</SPAN> TOP10 with plasmids containing the whole tumor sensor circuit and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Experiments/Tumor_Sensor#AND_gate_with_QS">evaluated</A> the cultures behaviour under healthy and tumor tissue conditions at steady-state population densities. With this experiment, we aimed at characterizing the bacteria's capability to autonomously interpret their environment with respect to lactate and population density. We found that at low densities, &quot;tumor&quot; lactate levels induce an increase in expression of GFP over conditions in healthy tissue. At high densities this effect is not very pronounced.</LI></UL></P></SECTION><SECTION id="phaseI"><H1>Phase I: Initial System Design</H1><P>The precise genetic design of our synthetic hybrid promoter was inspired by the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Results#Characterization_of_synthetic_promoter_library">work of the ETH iGEM team 2015</A>. Based on their <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1847008">synthetic lactate-responsive promoter</A> we came up with the idea to introduce pLux at the place of their constitutive promoter. Considering potential steric requirements of LuxR, the regulator of pLux, we further suspected spacing between pLux and O2 to be of importance. Thus, we designed another version with increased spacing. Additionally, we hypothesized that including each operator site twice would result in a stronger effect of LldR.</P><P>Before we started any designing of regulators, cloning or experimentation on the tumor sensor module, we <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/model">built a model</A> and made the most it to 
 <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/parameter_space">find key parameters</A> relevant for the sequences design.</P><H2>KEY QUESTIONS</H2><UL><LI>Based on previous work done on quorum sensing: how strongly should LuxR and LuxI be expressed? <EM><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/parameter_space#parameter_search_sec">Long answer</A>.

Quick answer:</EM> Use the already well characterized part <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1847008">BBa_K1847008</A></LI><LI>At what density of the colony under experimental conditions should the quorum sensing system be activated?<EM><A href="https://2017.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/parameter_fitting#od005">Long answer</A>. Quick answer:</EM> At an optical density (<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OD600">OD600</A>) of 0.05. The population density in the colonized layer in tumors would translate to an OD of about 60. Contrary to <I>in vivo</I> conditions however, in our experimental setup there would be no diffusion of AHL out of the system, amounting to an &quot;overestimation&quot; of the population density compared to <I>in vivo</I> conditions. Therefore, the activation threshold of quorum sensing should be at such low ODs.</LI></UL></SECTION><DIV class="multi-summary"><SECTION id="QS_end_point"><H1>Phase II: Quorum Sensing End-Point Characterization</H1><P><B>OBJECTIVE</B>

Two plasmids (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/4/4a/T--ETH_Zurich--piG17-2-004.gb">regulator</A> and actuator containing AND-gate designs <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/b/b9/T--ETH_Zurich--piG17-1-008a.gb"><B>A</B></A>, <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/c/cb/T--ETH_Zurich--piG17-1-008b.gb"><B>B</B></A> and <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/1/11/T--ETH_Zurich--piG17-1-008c.gb"><B>C</B></A>) required for the AND-gate were transformed into <SPAN class="bacterium">E. coli</SPAN> TOP10 (figure 4). Exponential-phase cultures were induced in microtiter plates under combinations of 8 different <A href="parts.igem.org/3OC6HSL">AHL</A> and 8 different L-lactate concentrations and measured after 5.5 hours growth in the plate.

The actuator plasmid consists of the AND-gate promoter as well as the fluorescent reporter <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K515105">sfGFP</A>.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><B>RESULTS</B> 
All our synthetic promoters react to increasing inducer levels by increasing expression of the encoded gene. Hence, the highest level of activation coincides with the highest amounts of both inducers. No activation is observed at low and intermediary concentrations of inducers and only in regimes with high amounts of inducer there is an increase in expression levels.
We noticed that in a first experiment no plateau was reached and therefore expanded inducer concentration ranges in a second run. In this experiment we observe that a plateau was reached and we could use this data to <A href="https://2017.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:ETH_Zurich/Model/Environment_Sensing/AND_gate_fitting#fitand">fit our model of the AND-gate</A>.

Thus, it enables the engineered bacteria to sense the environment with regard to the inducers we chose.</LI><LI>Independently of the amount of the cognate inducer, both lactate and AHL alone at high concentrations lead to somewhat increased expression levels.</LI><LI>While characterizing the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Circuit/Fb_MRI_Contrast_Agent">MRI Imaging Module</A>, a <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/Experiments/MRI_Contrast_Agent#dose-response">dose-response curve</A> of the pLux promoter to AHL was obtained. We found that the threshold for induction is around 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M AHL. Here, this value lies around 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M AHL. Thus, we came to realize that we cannot assume the behaviour of pLux alone to be similar to that of pLux in the hybrid promoter context. Based on this result we decided to focus more on the quorum sensing system in the hybrid promoter context rather than on tuning it independently as in figure 3. Also, to find the AHL and lactate levels where expression plateaus, we ran the experiment again with a broader range of inducer concentrations (see figure 5 b).</LI><LI>We hypothesize that this decrease in sensitivity is caused by reduced accessibility of LuxR to the pLux promoter in the hybrid promoter context.

The densities of the cultures at steady-state were modulated by varying the amount of provided glucose in the media.

There is a clear increase in fluorescence both for increasing lactate concentrations as well as population densities. Fold-changes in fluoresence per Abs<SUB>600</SUB> between least and highest culture densities range between 2 and 8, reflecting activation of the quorum sensing part of our AND-gate system. Also for lactate, increasing concentrations coindice with increasing fluorescence levels of around 2 to 4 between 0 and 5 mM lactate. For the lactate levels we want CATE to be able to differentiate, namely 1 mM for healthy tissue versus 5 mM for tumor tissue, the fold-changes in activation range from 1 to 2-fold.

Nevertheless, based on this data we conclude that the activation threshold is at an A600 of  ~1.</LI><LI>Compared to the experiment without autonomous quorum sensing, the influence of lactate is weakend. While in the first case, the fold change between &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;tumor&quot; lactate levels is around 5, in the latter case this value is reduced to around 2. We hypothesize that this is an artefact caused by accumulation of GFP in non-dividing cells found in steady-state cultures such as the ones in this experiment.</LI><LI>Similarly, the fold-change is not as pronounced in this experiment compared to the one shown in figure 5 between very low and very high AHL amounts. This could indicate that AHL concentrations in the cultures were in the range of 10<SUP>-11</SUP> to 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M, which is where we observed similar fold-changes before. Another explanation for this could also be the artefact already mentioned.</LI></UL></P></SECTION></DIV><SECTION class="references"><H1>References</H1><OL><LI id="bib1">Contois, D.
