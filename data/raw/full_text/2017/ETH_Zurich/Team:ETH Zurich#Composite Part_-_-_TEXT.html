Description
BioBrick
PConst_RBSeng_TlpA
Best Composite Part: Constitutively expressed temperature-dependent transcriptional repressor of pTlpa with engineered RBS
BBa_K2500008
Design
All parts were codon-optimized for expression in E. coli Nissle with Geneious and modified to remove forbidden restriction sites.
BBa_K2500008: PConst_RBSeng_TlpA
Design notes: A RBS library was created using the Red Libs algorithm to find variants translating more TlpA RNA in order to create a thermoswitch tight enough to repress the premature induction of cell lysis by protein E.
Organism: Salmonella typhimurium
Based on: BBa_J23104 (promoter) and Piraner, Dan I., et al.
Nature Chemical Biology
13.1 (2017): 75-80. (TlpA)
