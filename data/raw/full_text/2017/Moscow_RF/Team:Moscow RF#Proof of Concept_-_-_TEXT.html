I.Cloning biobricks 2488000 and 2488002:
Biobricks were cloned with the restriction sites Spel and Pstl, as the instructions posted on the IGEM website were misunderstood.
Restriction sites were introduced into the structure with PCR using synthetic primers.
II.Cloning biobrick 2488001:
Biobrick was cloned using Gibson Assembly MasterMix and synthetic primers created especially for this purpose.
