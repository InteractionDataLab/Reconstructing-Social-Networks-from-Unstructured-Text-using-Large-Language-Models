Denis Rebrikov - Primary PI
Denis Rebrikov is a D.Sc. in Genetics and the Vice Rector for Research at the Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University. His primary field of study is molecular biology and gene engineering. For a few years, he has been an academic supervisor for human genome and microbiome studies, design and implementation of innovative biotechnologies for medical diagnostics, genotyping, GMO detection and measurement, DNA fingerprinting, and genome editing. He is the author of over a hundred publications in major national and international journals and first national textbooks on the real-time PCR and NGS methods.
Alexei Shevelev - Secondary PI
Alexei Shevelev is a Sc.D. in Biology. His primary field of study is creating expression systems which make it possible to obtain a wide range of various proteins. His developments in this field have been successfully used for studying structural and functional organization of entomocidal toxins of bacilli and proteolytic enzymes, muscle growth factors, bacterial pathogenicity factors, plant proteinase inhibitors and viral antigens. Alexei is the author of national and international scientific publications and a holder of multiple national patents for inventions.
Elena Ivanova - Team Leader
Elena Ivanova is a third-year student at the Biological and Medical Physics Department of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and our team leader. She never stops learning something new and finding out-of-the-box solutions to tricky tasks. She has loved biology since her school years for the unique beauty intrinsic to it and at the same time she is fond of physics and mathematics. Elena’s hobbies are orienteering and cooking.
