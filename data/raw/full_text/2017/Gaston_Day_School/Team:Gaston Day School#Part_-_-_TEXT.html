Baseline Corrected of Control vs. GlmY
Figure 1 shows that the plasmid carrying GlmY gives a small but significant increase in the resistance to low concentrations of isobutanol even though no promoter is present. At 60 ul isobutanol, the control had 12% survival while the culture with the GlmY plasmid had 25% survival. This increased resistance to isobutanol did not persist at higher concentrations.
Construct 1 (GlmY with a constitutive promoter):
Increase regulation of GlmZ which activates glmS expression.
Figure 2 shows a characterized construct of part number BBa_K1320100. J23102 is a constitutive promoter, while K2221000 is GlmY.
