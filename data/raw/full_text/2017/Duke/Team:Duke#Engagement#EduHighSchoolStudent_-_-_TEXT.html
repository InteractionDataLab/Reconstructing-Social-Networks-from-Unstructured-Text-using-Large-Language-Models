Teaching
Part of iGEM is not only about contributing to our current community but also expanding that community. Duke iGEM always enjoys getting others involved and teaching is a main tenet of our overall human practices strategy. To not only teach people about what science is we also wanted to teach practical skills to as many as we could. As a result, we taught two different students wet lab skills.
During the course of our project we had two different students work with our team. Justin Park joined our team during the summer; he is a high school student from William G. Enloe High School. Emma worked with Justin to teach him basic lab skills and show him how academic research actually works. After the semester started, Daniel joined our team and Azim was able to teach him valuable skills that Daniel hopes to propel into future iGEM projects. Below is more information about each of their experiences.
Justin's Testimonial
This summer during my research internship at the Lynch Lab, I was given the opportunity to work with the Duke iGem team. The opportunity to work on a college iGem team was one-of-a-kind as I was only a high school student. It was amazing that as a high school student I had access to all of the lab and iGem resources. I learned a lot about synthetic biology and I learned various lab skills. I actually loved the experience so much that I shifted my high school extracurricular focus to synthetic biology and I am currently laying out the plans to start an iGem team at my school in preparation for next years competition. Working with college students on the iGem project every day cemented my passion for science and I hope to pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering in college. Working on the iGem team was a truly extraordinary experience and it is something that I will never forget.

We thought Justin's experience would be helpful for other young scientists so we asked him to guest star on our channel. Here is his video.
Daniel's Testimonial
Working with the Duke 2017 iGEM team has been a really great experience. As someone who doesn’t have much background in bioengineering, the team has provided a very friendly environment in which I felt welcome. The members always encouraged asking for clarifications in the case that I was lost or confused so I’ve never felt embarrassed to ask any questions. Their instructions have been very clear and their feedback has been very supportive. The way in which they explained all the background and concepts behind every step in their process really demonstrated their passion and dedication for their project. I have learned a great deal already in what has been a short period of time and look forward to applying the skills I learned to next year’s project! -Daniel Getman
