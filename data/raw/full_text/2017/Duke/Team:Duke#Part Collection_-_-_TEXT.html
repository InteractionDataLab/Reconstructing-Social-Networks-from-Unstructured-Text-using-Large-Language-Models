BBa_K2464000- BBa_K2464002 are the parts that comprise our “improve a part” portion of iGEM. In pSB1C3 (and all iGEM vectors) the Biobrick prefix and suffix have homology to each other and because of this, attempts at Gibson assembly usually end with self-ligation of the iGEM vector and rejection of the insert. BBa_K2464000 is pSB1C3 with the typical RFP insert, except we removed “gcggccg” from the suffix, which was homologous to the prefix. The SpeI and PstI cut sites are preserved and this iteration of pSB1C3 that we’ve dubbed pSB1C3_Gibson is more effective in Gibson assembly. BBa_K2464001 and BBa_K2464002 are the forward and reverse primers, respectively, that we designed to perform Q5 mutagenesis on pSB1C3 to make pSB1C3_Gibson.
To find out more about the experiments and specific improvements we made to the pSB1C3 backbone explore our Contribution and Improvement pages.
