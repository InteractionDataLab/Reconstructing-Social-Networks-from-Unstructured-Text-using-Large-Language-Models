r/iGEM_Exchange
As members of iGEM, we are taking our first steps towards becoming participants in this field of science. It's important we create a discourse within our community aimed at making us all more self-aware and conscientious towards the societal impacts of our work so that the power of bioengineering is in responsible hands. Also, everyone needs a good meme now and then to get through a long day of lab work!
In order to meet these needs, Duke iGEM started r/iGEM_Exchange. The following teams have collaborated with us as moderators of this forum for iGEM discussions:
Gaston Day High School
East Chapel High School
Together we've had fun discussing a wide variety of topics such as the ethical implications of synthetic biology, current research, and IGEM memes! Currently we are working with iGEM HQ to expand our advertising in order to get the whole community involved. Check it out here !
