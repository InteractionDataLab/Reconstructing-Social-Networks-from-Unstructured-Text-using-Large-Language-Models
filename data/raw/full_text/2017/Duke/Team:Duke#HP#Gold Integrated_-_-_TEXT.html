Integrated Practices
Please refer to our economic and cultural explorations as well as our interviews for more detailed research that helped us to consider these basic design requirements.
The encouragement of a lateral flow design is designed to help network with traditional health practitioners by making the technology look and act like malarial test strips already in use in the region.
The low cost associated with production due to thermostability of Grffithsin helps to make any rapid diagnostic test more economically compatible with the region.
The high degree of accuracy is designed to provide the highest available level of care in order to better inform people about their HIV status. This kind of knowledge, or at least access to it is one more step toward the de-stigmatization of HIV/AIDS in the region.
