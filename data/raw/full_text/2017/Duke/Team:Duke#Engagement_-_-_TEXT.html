Education In our Lab
During the course of the summer, our lab hosted a high school student, Justin Park, in our lab. He shadowed lab members and learned about the different procedures associated with synthetic biology. While we were sad to see him leave at the end of the summer, we really enjoyed being able to teach him so much about something that he didn't know much about. He was also one of our guests on our youtube channel. Click here to learn more about Justin's summer experience! During the semester, Daniel also shadowed our team. He is a fellow Duke student who was looking for greater exposure to wetlab. Witnessing his drive to learn evolve into an appreciation for synthetic biology has been a pleasure. He also starred on our YouTube Channel.

Engagement with our Community
Marbles Kids Museum
In addition to teaching Justin over the summer, our team also went into the local community to educate about synthetic biology. One of our programs centered around elementary students and getting them excited about DNA and biology. Our team made visits to the Marbles Kids Museum in Raleigh where team members were Guest Star Scientists and taught kids how to make oragami DNA, candy DNA, and necklaces with DNA from wheat germ! Both the kids and our team had a truly DNAtastic time! For more information on our visits to the Marbles Kids Museum, click here
Mosquito Forum
Another of our programs centered on using the adapted curriculum we created during our collaboration with Gaston Day School, and East Chapel Hill High School (click here for more information on the collaboration) and used the curriculum on our college campus as well as in the local community. Our team had a really great time not only educating our peers and local community on synthetic biology but also discussing the ethical issues surrounding it. To learn more about the curriculum and the individual sessions, click here .
Youtube Channel
In order to broaden our outreach, we also created a youtube channel. Our goal was to not only provide helpful tutorials that would answer the questions people new to the field may have but also to educate the general public on synthetic biology. We also interviewed our own team as well as several guests to provide perspectives on a variety of scientific subjects. For more information, click here and please subscribe!
