Expert Interview with Sherryl Broverman
“You get your blood pressure tested every time you go to the doctor: height, weight, blood pressure, body temperature. Why not HIV?” -Sherryl Broverman Ph.D
We asked a professor who has done work with young women in Muhuru Bay, a small lake town in Kenya on Lake Victoria, to sit down and talk with us about how an RDT might be beneficial for the region, and how it may not be. Overall, Dr. Broverman was excited at the prospect of cheap reliable diagnostic tests that don’t require refrigeration being introduced to the region and offered some serious insight into how the test may need to be modified to help the most people.
