Design
To design criteria for a lateral flow assay, we developed an outline of important design specifications determined via a simple market analysis.
With these design criteria in mind, we developed the following lateral flow assay.
Solution: Lateral Flow Assay
In order to achieve this lateral flow assay our team focused on engineering a thermostable variant of griffithsin which would be needed to create the assay and allow the diagnostic to have a longer shelf life. If this part were to be produced, then the rest of the assay would only require an assembly of the required parts. The major focus of our wet lab was focused on developing this thermostable variant of griffithsin.
