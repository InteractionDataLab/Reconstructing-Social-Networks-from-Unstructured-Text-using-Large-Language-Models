Acknowledgements
General Support
We would like to thank all of the members of the Lynch Lab for their general assistance. All troubleshooting and experiments not mentioned below were done by team members. However, procedural and technical questions, corrections, and guidance were addressed by the Lynch Lab members. We also, would not have been able to do half as much without the full support of the Pratt School of Engineering, the Duke Bass Connections program, and Duke University.
Design Support
Original design and concepts were created by our team members. Technical review and questions were answered with help from Cassio Fontes from the Chilkoti Group as well as by John Decker and Mike Lynch from the Lynch Lab.
All experiments were carried out by students.
Experimental Support
Our group would also like to thank Brian Watts from the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and Brady Travis for taking the time to train some of our members on machines necessary for the completion of our project including a homogenizer and an SPR assay machine.
Human Practices Support
In addition to technical support, we would also like to thank individuals who helped to guide us in our human practices investigations. We would like to thank Leighanne Oh for helping to put us in contact with doctors in Uganda as well as talk to us about her overall experiences of the country. We would also like to thank Professor Sherryl Broverman from the Duke Global Health Institute.
Funding Support
None of our research would have been possible without the financial support of the Lord Foundation , the Duke Bass Connections Program , IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) , Duke Undergraduate Research Support Office , the Duke Energy Initiative , CBET NSF (Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems) , or the ONR YIP # 12043956 (DOE:EE0007563 ) .
We would like to extend our thanks to all of these people who helped us with our project. Without their help, our project would not have been possible.
