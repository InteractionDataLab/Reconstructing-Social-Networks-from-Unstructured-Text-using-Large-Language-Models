Gaston Day School
We began our collaboration with Gaston Day School last year for the 2016 Jamboree. This year, Adam and Emma attended the Southeastern Mini Convention hosted in Gastonia at the beginning of August. At the convention our two teams briefed each other on our respective projects. After discussing potential pitfalls in each project, our representatives tried to help the high school troubleshoot some of their problems.
One way we helped the team was by teaching them about Q5 mutagenesis. We discussed the procedure at length and upon returning to Durham, we sent the team literature as well as tools to help them design and perform their own Q5 mutagenesis (including designing their own primers).
In October, Parth visited his former high school and team and was updated on the progress they had made. Below are several pictures from his reunion! While there, Parth helped the Gaston Day Team troubleshoot further problems that had arisen and suggested using competent cells from one of our strains to increase miniprep DNA yields.
When Parth returned, our team also thought of a way to help the Gaston Day team characterize their part further. We have the ability to run a time course assay and in this manner would be able to provide more data on their cells. Gaston Day attempted to send their samples to us but were unable to deliver any product to us before the deadline.
