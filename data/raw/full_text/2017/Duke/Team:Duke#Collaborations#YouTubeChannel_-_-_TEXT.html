Untitled Document
YouTube Channel
Our overall goal with the YouTube channel was to provide answers for other iGEM teams as well as to provide general knowledge for the public. This means that we not only included instructional videos but we also conducted interviews to provide different perspectives on a variety of scientific subjects.

About our YouTube Channel
Duke iGEM 2017 is an group of slightly eclectic individuals who call Durham, NC home at least for the foreseeable future. Between classes, basketball games, and lab work we make educational videos as well as interviews with our members and members from our collaborators! We hope these videos help answer questions that you may have! If you have any suggestions feel free to let us know!
Special Guests!
Throughout the course of our channel, we had several guests on our Channel. Members from Oxford, UW Seattle, East Chapel Hill High School, and Gaston Day iGEM teams collaborated with us on several interviews. We also were able to interview our own shadows with Justin Park and Daniel Getman, the two students we taught over the summer (click here for more information on their experiences).These videos are below.
Interview Series
As shown above, our team interviewed several other iGEM teams. However, we also interviewed our own members to hear their perspective on science! Below are just some of the interviews we conducted of our own team.
