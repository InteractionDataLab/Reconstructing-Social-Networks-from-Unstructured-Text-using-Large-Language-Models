GRFT Targets
Monomeric GRFT (PDB 3ll2)
Monomeric Griffithsin can be isolated from red algae and tobacco plants.
Through Yasara, its stability in its repaired conformation was predicted to be 6.35 (kcal/mol).
Dimeric GRFT (PDB 2HYQ)
Dimeric and tandemeric Griffithsin can be engineered to enhance the binding interactions between the protein and Gp120.
Through Yasara, its stability in its repaired conformation was predicted to be 21.1 (kcal/mol).

Docking Targets
HIV Envelope glycoprotein Gp120 (1MEQ)
Gp120 is a viral glycoprotein formed once the protease of a host cell processes the HIV 1 envelope.
HIV antibody Antibody N6 (5TE4)
Antibody N6 is a neutralizing antibody of class VRC01.
The image below shows the three chains of the antibody in red, orange, and yellow.
Llama VHH 237 (5HM1)
Llama VHH is an HIV antibody composed of three monomeric subunits colored in orange, red, and magenta in the figure above.
Zika Antibody ZV67 (5KVG)
ZV67 is an Zika antibody that binds to the Zika envelope DIII.
The image below shows the two subunits of ZV67 in magenta and cyan with the envelope protein shown in green.
Zika Antibody Z23 (5GZN)
Z23 is an Zika antibody that binds to the Zika envelope.
The image below shows the three chains of Z23 with the envelope protein shown in green.
