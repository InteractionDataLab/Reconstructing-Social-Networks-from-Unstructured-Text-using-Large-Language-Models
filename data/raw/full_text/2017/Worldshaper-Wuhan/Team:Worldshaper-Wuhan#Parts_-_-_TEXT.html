HERE ARE ALL OF OUR PARTS
We constructed five plasmids-pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s; pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-2s; pHAGE-pre-miR-21; pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-2s and pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-6s. The plasmids of pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-6s and pEGFP-miR-21-sponge-2s were used to monitor the expression of miR-21 in cells. We also used pHAGE-pre-miR-21 to manipulate miR-21 expression in cells. And the plasmids of pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-6s and pSB1C3-miR-21-sponge-2s were submitted to 2017IGEM (part number: BBa_K2514000 and BBa_K2514001).
