eGFP
eGFP is short for Enhanced Glowing Fluorescent Protein which is used as a reporter gene. In our experiment, the plasmid is attached to the sponge RNA through ligation to make the binding of miR-21 and the inserted sponge observable, and thus enable us to determine the presence of miR-21 in the sample.
