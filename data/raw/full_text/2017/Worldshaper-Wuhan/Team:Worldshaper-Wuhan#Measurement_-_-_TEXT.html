In our experiment, we use GFP as an indicative of the efficiency of miR-21-sponge-6s and miR-21-sponge-2s as mir-21 detectors, and quantified the mir-21 expression in the cells through the plasmid pHAGE-pre-mir-21. Then we gathered our data and plotted them into two standard curves on excel. Through comparing the slope of standard curves of miR-21-sponge-2s and miR-21-sponge-6s respectively, we determine that miR-12-sponge-2s is more sensitive than miR-21-sponge-6s.
