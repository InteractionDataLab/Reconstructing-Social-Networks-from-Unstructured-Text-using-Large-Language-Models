Model
Fig. Model for the effect of miR-21 sponge in cells. After introduction of the sponge transgene, sponge RNAs are expressed at a high level and attract miR-21, inhibiting the expression of eGFP reporter. The expression of miR-21 should be identified by their eGFP reporter expression.
Model
We created a model which can measure the expression of miRNA in cells by using miRNA sponges. This model is very novel because it is the first time of using miRNA sponges to monitor the expression levels of miRNA. The principal of the model based on characteristic of sponge RNAs, which can attact miRNA and inhibit the expression of miRNA-target (Figure).
