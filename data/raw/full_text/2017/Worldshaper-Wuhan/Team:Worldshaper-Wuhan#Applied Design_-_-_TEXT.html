Applied Design
We designed a novel technique to t evaluate the expression of miRNA in this project. Previously, miRNA sponge was thought as an effective inhibitor for miRNA and used for miRNA function study in cells. Now, we used them as a monitor to evaluate the expression of miRNA. Our data indicated miRNA sponge may be a novel part for diagnosis colorectal cancer in the future. Our data suggested the slope of the standard curve of miR-21-sponge-2s is better than miR-21-sponge-6s, suggesting the more sensitive of miR-21-sponge-2s as a monitor (Figure). Meanwhile, previous studies indicated miRNA sponge is an effective inhibitor of miRNA, which suggest that this part should be a potential therapy to treat colorectal cancer in the future.
