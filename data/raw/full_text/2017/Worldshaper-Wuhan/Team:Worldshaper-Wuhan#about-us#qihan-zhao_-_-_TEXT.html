Greetings！
I am extremely captivated by microbiology and its applications in our day-to-day lives. I plan to become a researcher in such fields in the future and resort to relevant knowledges to help those in needs. Apart from my interests in bioengineering, I am also a huge sports fan of soccer, basketball and volleyball, which I play competitively as well.
