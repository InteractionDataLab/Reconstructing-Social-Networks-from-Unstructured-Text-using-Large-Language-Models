OD600 reference point
Fluorescein standard curve
Worldshaper-Wuhan _InterLab_201
Fluorescence Measurement
1.    O0 Reference point
Prepare a column of 4 wells with 100 µl 100% LUDOX and 4 wells containing 100 µl  . Repeat the measurement in all relevant modes used in your experiments.
2.    Protocol fluorescein fluorescence standard curve
The same cuvettes, plates and volumes were used to avoid calibration errors. Next, we determined the fluorescein standard curve through dilution series in 4 different replicate rows. Using the settings for GFP, the 4 rows were measured and the results were used to determine the resulting curve.
3.    Test
The protein GFP was analyzed using the InterLab parts found on Kit Plate 6. This test devices were transformed into the E. coli strain DH5 alpha. Using our defined parameters, we tested the expression of a positive control (BBa_I20270), negative control (BBa_R0040) and 6 different test devices.
