 <H5>Using this, we can calculate the concentration of proteins we can expect over time.

This is not true as once the structures begin to form, the paths stop  (they do not collide off each other elastically, but rather, combine.) Furthermore, there would be no transposition once it's in the bacterium otherwise it would become biased towards options that put less metabolic stress on the bacterium. </H5><H5> This is a limitation on the system which could be solved by using metabolites, which are random as shown by
