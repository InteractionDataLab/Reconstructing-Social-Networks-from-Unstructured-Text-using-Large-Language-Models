STEP 5: Freeze drying & Revival
Here are the results of our freeze-dried cells revival experiments. With these experiments, we want to show that different storage do not have an effect on the revival of the cells within our key.
STEP 6: CRISPRi & guideRNA efficiency
This picture shows our gRNAs working visually, but the graphs show the results of RFP detection using a microplate reader on cultures containing each of the dCas9 plasmids with one promoter-RFP-terminator brick, with its corresponding gRNA plasmid,  or with a non-targeting gRNA plasmid.
