Bake Sale
________________
Our first outreach activity was baking lots of delicious cakes to raise money for our project (£133!) and to speak to other researchers in the building about our project and where they thought we could improve.
Brigitte's blog
________________
Chris and Vik went to speak to Brigitte Nerlich, who writes fantastic blog posts about the weird and wonderful things that happen in the scientific world. You can read the blog post by clicking this link.
People Like Us Event
________________
Natalia and Ellie led a session where they taught 60 year 8 girls how to extract DNA from strawberries using everyday reagents. This event was to encourage young girls to interact with and consider science as a career option later. We had plenty of questions about what our degrees involved and what we do on a daily basis in the lab. We even got asked whether we could mush up a human finger and extract DNA from that instead of strawberries... scary stuff!
University Open Days
________________
Jake and Ellie went down to the open days on campus to talk to people about routes into synthetic biology, what iGEM is and how to get involved, and about our project. We had some incredibly bright young people very excited about the possibilities of synthetic biology and genetic engineering so this was incredibly rewarding for us!
Fun Palaces
________________
In early October, Chris had a great time chatting to local people about our project at Fun palaces 2017 Mansfield Museum! He got a lot of people excited about science by using food colouring, jellyfish and games to demostrate the idea of different fluorescent colour measurements of our bacteria and how our project works. Nice job Chris!
Tech Nottingham
________________
Vik and Georgette went to a social event called Tech Nottingham, where they gave a presentation on our project and had a great time chatting to people about our project and getting feedback on our idea.
