CONCEPT ORIGIN
___________________________
 
Weeks went by, from transposons to baldness cream 
Ideas were thought, that were once only a dream 
A passion for ideas, porins also may just seem 
Nothing of course to those who aren't in the team  
A debate every week, yes thats what we held 
A plan of action was made and Tom was expelled 
The porins were ditched and transposons were dealt 
Their finishing blow, at least that's what we all felt
So this is our idea at least for now, okay 
Inspiration of one was found on the last day 
Bacterial keys is what they say 
But will this idea with its aspirations give us our pay?
To use dCas9 to inihibit genes randomly 
fluorescent proteins expressed, crimson, emerald and sapphirey 
Plasmid parts mixed quite well brownianly 
DNA pieces in a soup of a biochemistry degree
Light levels measured to open the door 
are they the same as the mother or are you knocked to the floor? 
The Police are called to the science parade tour 
The Key.coli is created to stop a final world war.
