COLLABORATIONS
 
iGEM Development Environment
We have collaborated with the 2017 UK Bristol iGEM team this summer in order to use and test their new tool called the 'iGEM Development Environment' also known as 'IDE'.
 
The IDE is a local testing environment created by the Bristol iGEM team. The environment would allow users to deisgn and upload their entire wiki pages after fine-tuning to the users desired end product. The IDE also has an in-built feature that avoids unwanted interactions between the users navigation bar and  iGEM's own navigation bar. This environment was perfect for our purposes!
 
The IDE was very useful to our team since our team members are proficient in many coding languages... except HTML coding! This was just our luck, however, once the Bristol team had contacted us via Skype we quickly realised their software is just what we needed for our main wiki editor (Jake) to get going with our wiki design.
 
We were not able to use the IDE to upload our entire wiki to the iGEM website as intended since we had already started when the Bristol team had contacted us. Nevertheless, we were able to use it to design each page of the wiki.

Freeze-dried Cell Revival
In September, we sent our freeze-dried cells out to Groningen and Sheffield in order to see how reliable the fluorescence from our keys can be read after revival using a set method.
 
The Key. coli key will contain freeze-dried cells that will produce a specific fluorescence spectra that will be compared to the "lock" colony in order to gain access to the locked appliance using our own software. Before this, the freeze-dried cells must be revived.
 
This was a very important collection of collaborations because we will need to know the required time to obtain sufficient fluorescence after revival as well as how easy to follow our revival protocol is for potential users. To see the results that Groningen and Sheffield collected for us, have a look at our results page

Groningen's results
You can find Groningen's results in the 'Freeze-drying' section of our experiments page.
Sheffield's results
Sheffield kept their Key. coli for two months, during which time the freeze dried bacteria survival dropped and no revival occured. This demonstrates the temporary and therefore secure nature of the device.
