Outside of the lab, I am teaching myself piano and how to use Python. I have great fun trying (and failing miserably) to “talk computer” with Vik, our computer scientist, however it is definitely a weak area of mine and iGEM has given me opportunities to learn new things from people who I would never normally come across in my day to day life. iGEM has really advanced me as a scientist, more than I ever thought it could!

He loves working with a bit of everything and therefore as well as main stream biology a large amount of his experience is in Molecular Dynamics Simulation and bioinformatics. For the majority of the project he has been in the lab team,but he spent his out of lab time making games or prototype modelling programs. He enjoys doing new things, is easily obsessed with the latest craze and has an overactive imagination. His hobbies include being a know it all, drawing, photography, and making music playlists. He has always wanted to be a mad scientist, therefore he knew iGEM was the perfect chance to create pure evil.

He was drawn to how almost magical it seemed to be using bacteria in this way and could not believe he had not heard about Synthetic biology sooner. iGEM is also the reason he is studying Biotechnology since it very closely relates to synthetic biology. </P><P style="margin-left: 40px" align="left">“iGEM has been even more intense than I imagined it to be and an experience I will not forget. I cannot stress enough the large amount of skills I’ve gained such as HTML coding, lab skills such as carryout of gel electrophoresis and general team work and optimism. I am looking forward to the infamous Boston Jamboree and hearing some cool accents.

Natalia’s non-scientific hobbies are yoga and film-making.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px" align="left"> “Being a part of iGEM helped me to learn more about my interests and develop necessary skills as a scientist. Long hours spent in the laboratory taught me many techniques which are very valuable in my further study and future job. As a member of iGEM team I’ve also had an opportunity to develop outside of the lab skills such as teamwork and effective communication. The DNA extraction outreach session was one of my favourite activities as it involved getting teenagers (potential future scientists) more interested in science and genetics in a fun way.”</P><P style="margin-left: 40px" align="left"><B>Weird fact</B>: Natalia used to learn Latin and one of her favourite Latin phrases was “Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas”</P><P><SPAN style="color: #ffffff;"> </SPAN></P></DIV><P><SPAN style="color: #ffffff;"> </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="color: #ffffff;"> </SPAN></P><P><SPAN style="color: #ffffff;"> </SPAN></P><DIV style="width: 60%; height: 50%; float:right;"><H1>Georgette Sebastiao</H1><P style="margin-right: 40px" align="right">Georgette is a 3rd year Chemical Engineering student trying to experiment a bit of everything to give shape to her future career.

In the last four years, Georgette developed a passion for everything hair-related, so in her spare time (when she is not sleeping) she loves watching and producing hair tutorials as well as experimenting with her hair.</P><P style="margin-right: 40px" align="right">“I think iGEM is a great opportunity for students looking into working on a project of their own.

In his third year Matt tried to do as much of it as he could, as he knew he wanted to continue on towards a career in this field. Matt chose to do his dissertation investigating synthetic biology applications to cardiac regeneration, and of course applying for the iGEM team.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px" align="left">&quot;It has been a fantastic experience, it has greatly furthered my knowledge of how research is conducted and developed invaluable team working skills, all the while having fun. The iGEM competition as a whole is so profound for an undergraduate, it really exposes you to the world of research with all the incredible people and their ideas. It really motivates you to continue on as a scientist, as you are shown how much of an impact you can have and what you can achieve; you get to design your project from scratch, choosing what problem you are passionate about and how you would fix it. Overall, 10/10 would recommend.
