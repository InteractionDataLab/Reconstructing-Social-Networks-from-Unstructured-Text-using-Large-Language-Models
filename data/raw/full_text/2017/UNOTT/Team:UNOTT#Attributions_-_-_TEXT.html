PIs, Instructors and Advisors
Many thanks to our PIs, advisors and supervisors for being involved in every step of the project. Their advice and support were paramount for the success of the team.  It was reassuring knowing that there were people we could turn to when we were not sure on how to proceed.
Project support and advice: Thanks to Ines Canadas, Sophie Vaud, Daphne Groothuis, Maria Zygouropoulou, James Gilbert, Luca Rossoni, Nigel Minton and Alex Conradie for giving andvice and support with project and time management as well as remind us of the resources and techniques available.
Brainstorming Support and Advice: Thanks to Nigel Minton, Alex Conradie, Daphne Groothuis, Maria Zygouropoulou, Ines Canadas, Sophie Vaud, Luca Rossoni and James Gilbert for being present at our brainstorming sessions and help us undestand the feasibility of our various ideas.
Laboratory Support: Thanks to Maria Zygouropoulou, Ines Canadas, Sophie Vaud and Daphne Groothuis for being so patient and helpful in the lab by teaching us lab techniques and helping us understand and interpret results.
Design of Experiment: Thanks to Daphne Groothuis, Maria Zygouropoulou, Ines Canadas and Sophie Vaud for helping we would not be able to properly design our experiments.
General Support Counselling: Thanks to Ines Canadas, Sophie Vaud, Daphne Groothuis, Maria Zygouropoulou, Luca Rossoni and James Gilbert for being readily available to answer all our question, for helping with ordering consumables and and much more.
Wiki support: Thanks to Luca Rossoni, James Gilbert, Sophie Vaud, Daphne Groothuis, Maria Zygouropoulou and Ines Canadas for constantly checking and giving feedback on our wiki content and design.

External Support
We were able to do a lot, but not everything. The external support we received was undoubtedly an added value for the team and facilitated a lot in completing important tasks the team, our supervisors and advisors were not able to perform. Thus, the team is eternally thankful for the effort the following people put into helping the team:
Louise Dynes, for helping us from day one with the various task including outreach, team organization, fund raising, fund management and travel.
Ed Bolts lab, for providing us with dCas9 for the final stages of our lab work.
Eurofins and Source Bioscience, for helping with DNA sequencing.
Groningen iGEM Team, for accepting to collaborate with us by testing and providing results from the revival of our freeze-dried cells.
Sheffield iGEM Team, for accepting to collaborate with us by testing and providing results from the revival of our freeze-dried cells.
Valdemar Marques, for doing the 3D modelling of our key transport device.
Yazid Lakhdar, for providing support and advice on our 3D model as well as on the prices of materials.
Jason Young, for reviewing and updating our 3D model, as well as helping with the actual 3D printing.
Sarah Chapman, for providing support with freeze-drying.
Euridice Real, for helping us with the team pictures.
Words of Appreciation
The Nottingham iGEM team would like to once again give thanks to everyone who has directly or indirectly contributed towards making our project possible and easier to carry out. Our words will never be enough to show the extent of our gratefulness. Thanks a lot.
