Biodiversity is threatened by climate change. The climate change have not caused extinctions, but have lead to a decrease of fitness in a number of species. By reinventing how to use transgenic organisms, the aspiration is to improve on the degrading biodiversity that can already be seen.

The consequences is not limited to local ecosystems, whole biomes can be affected.

The changes to biomes will have an effect on the ecosystems found within, and hereby also the biodiversity, which can have an overall negative effect in the fitness of species.

In agriculture an increase in GM plants can be seen, as crops have been modified to be herbicide tolerant (HT). This is primarily seen in soy, maize and cotton<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ip_gmo_09_2007_1_.pdf ">UCN (2007) ”Current knowledge of the impacts of genetically modified organisms on biodiversity and human health”. </A></SPAN></SPAN>. There are also plants modified to be arthropod tolerant (Bt), and is toxic to specific groups of arthropods.
 
Crops who have been modified with both HT and Bt, are so called stacked genes crops. HT crops allow farmers to more effectively manage pest and weeds in their fields, where Bt crops kills of pests as they feed on the plant<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ip_gmo_09_2007_1_.pdf ">UCN (2007) ”Current knowledge of the impacts of genetically modified organisms on biodiversity and human health”. </A></SPAN></SPAN>.

The overall effect of HT crops could end with a local fall in biodiversity, as weeds and other plants, together with arthropods, are simply removed with herbicides. Another threat would be the effect of horizontal gene-transfer between related species, where wild type plants get the HT gene from domesticated plants. This is seen in the golf field grass <I>Agrostis stolonifera</I> from a farm and the wild type <I>Agrostis gigantea</I><SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/40/14533.full

The HT gene was found in one-third of <I>A. gigantea seeds</I>, and up to 9 miles from the farm. This horizontal gene-transfer could lead to “superweeds”, needing more and stronger herbicide to get rid of<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293647479_IS_GMO_SUSTAINABLE_A_REVIEW_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENTAL_RISKS_OF_GM_PLANTS_IN_COMPARISON_WITH_CONVENTIONAL_AND_ORGANIC_CROPS">Prusak, Anna, Gene Rowe, and Jacek Strojny. &quot;Is GMO&quot; Sustainable&quot;?

Bt crops is toxic to arthropods, as seen with the Monarch butterfly in North America. The Monarch butterfly larvae would die from eating milkweed covered in pollen from BT crops, but thanks to Bt cotton in Mexico, the number of hibernating butterflies in cotton farms increased four times as less pesticide where needed in those areas<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293647479_IS_GMO_SUSTAINABLE_A_REVIEW_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENTAL_RISKS_OF_GM_PLANTS_IN_COMPARISON_WITH_CONVENTIONAL_AND_ORGANIC_CROPS">Prusak, Anna, Gene Rowe, and Jacek Strojny. &quot;Is GMO&quot; Sustainable&quot;?

Horizontal gene-transfer of the HT gene will not harm the biodiversity “in the wild”. As the gene does not increase the fitness of the domestic plant, unless there is a caretaker to spray for weeds and pests. Gene-transfer of the Bt gene could hurt the wild biodiversity. The plants overall fitness would increase, due to the ability to fight off arthropods who feed on it. This would lead to an overall fitness decrease in the feeding arthropods, as feeding animals dies from the toxin. This might lead to birds who feed on said arthropods to migrate from the area in search of food, leading to another loss in biodiversity<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext">Berthold, Peter.

</P><P class="P-Larger"><B>Future impact on biodiversity</B></P><P><SPAN class="largeFirstLetter">A</SPAN>s stated, climate change does have a negative impact on biodiversity. One way for GMOs to help improve biodiversity is to decrease the output of greenhouse gasses, or decrease the amount already found in our atmosphere. HT and Bt crops already help with that, lowering the amount of herbicides and pesticides used in agriculture fields. Optimizing photosynthesis for agriculture plants<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/155/1/79.short">Ort, Donald R., Xinguang Zhu, and Anastasios Melis. &quot;Optimizing antenna size to maximize photosynthetic efficiency.&quot; Plant physiology 155.1 (2011): 79-85.</A></SPAN></SPAN>, would not only reduce CO<SUB>2</SUB>, but could also increase growth in the plants. Incorporating photosynthesis into daily life usage, like our PowerLeaf, is one such possible and responsible solution.

GMO alone will not be able to negate the negative impact on biodiversity from climate change, and some effects we are already experiencing. GMO is able to help us on a direction to reduce the impacts on biodiversity. If used in conservation by reintroducing newly extinct species<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X08007784">Folch, J., et al. &quot;First birth of an animal from an extinct subspecies (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) by cloning.&quot; Theriogenology 71.6 (2009): 1026-1034.</A></SPAN></SPAN>, possible rebuilding lost ecosystems.

Lastly GMO can also help ecosystems by engineering flora and fauna, so they can resist changes caused by climate change, or promote a specific phenotype. When talking about releasing transgenic organisms into the natural environment, it leads to a whole other discussion of GMO.</P><P class="P-Larger"><B>The PowerLeaf</B></P><P><SPAN class="largeFirstLetter">T</SPAN>o avoid the discussion of GMO in the environment, and not at least to mitigate any effect, positive and negative, on the environment we designed our PowerLeaf to be isolated in a material called polycarbonate. This, alongside with a kill switch, should ensure that no contamination of local fauna and flora would arise. Therefore our product will not be able to influence wild types, neither by outcompeting nor horizontal gene-transfer. With these considerations in mind, we believe that our project is not only responsible but also environmentally safe.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal-footer"><A href="" class="btn btn-default" data-dismiss="modal">Close</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
