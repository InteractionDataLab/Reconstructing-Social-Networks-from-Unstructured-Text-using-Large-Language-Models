Ever since World War II, the West has seen an expansion and intensification of anti-scientific sentiment, which today primarily concern Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). We will for that reason explore GMO’s role in history, to see if a historical perspective will allow us reach a new understanding of these sentiments. You can read all about it <SPAN class="btn-link btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#historical-perspective">here</SPAN>.</P><DIV class="modal fade" id="historical-perspective" tabindex="-1" data-backdrop="false" style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,0.6);"><DIV class="modal-dialog modal-lg"><DIV class="modal-content"><DIV class="modal-header"><BUTTON type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal">×</BUTTON><H2 class="modal-title">A Historical Perspective on GMO</H2></DIV><DIV class="modal-body" margin-right="10%"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-10"><P class="P-Larger"><B>From Food Concerns to Sustainable Energy</B></P><P>When talking about the history of GMO, we have the rare privilege of choice, as  depending on how you define GMO, One could potentially choose any historical period as their starting point. For instance, we could be examining the breeding of wolves to dogs, or simple agriculture, where the bad seeds are destroyed in favour of higher quality crops<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href=" http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/from-corgis-to-corn-a-brief-look-at-the-long-history-of-gmo-technology/">Rangel G.

For the purpose of narrative, we will be starting our examination with the dawn of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. A time in which stale and rotten food lead to health concerns. Through several years, the public was continuously made aware of health problems regarding food in the United States. This culminated in the 1906 statute:, which allowed the inspection and ban of products<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Federal%20Food%20and%20Drugs%20Act%20of%201906&amp;item_type=topic"> JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013.</A></SPAN></SPAN>. During the time leading up to this act, the public grew to appreciate items labeled as pure. A trend we can observe in most journalistic material from the time period<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/2010270501/"> O’Keefe TJ. The Alliance herald. : (Alliance, Box Butte County, Neb.) 1902-1922. T.J. O'Keefe; 1902.</A></SPAN></SPAN>
This need for pure food naturally originated partly from several years of unsatisfactory food and health concerns<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Federal%20Food%20and%20Drugs%20Act%20of%201906&amp;item_type=topic"> JP S. The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement. FDA History - Part I US Food and Drug Administration. 2013.</A></SPAN></SPAN>, and partly from a political fiction: The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.abebooks.com/Jungle-Sinclair-Upton-Grosset-Dunlap-New/1291165375/bd"> Sinclair U. The Jungle. New York: Grosset &amp; Dunlap,; 1906 1906.</A></SPAN></SPAN>. 
The readers became aware of unsanitary practices in the American food industry. Sinclair was considered a whistleblower, having exposed the practices of the food industry. After the act of 1906, we can observe a rise in concerns over the purity of food, which in turn lead to a focus on maintaining a certain standard in foods. Over time, this concern became the driving force behind the development of pesticides, and to a certain extent, GMO. With the introduction of these solutions to food purity, a new and opposite response could quickly be observed in the public. With pesticides and GMO, the public quickly grew concerned that food would be unnatural, and thus we can observe what is known as a reverse halo effect<SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-psychology-of-distrusting-g-m-o-s"> Konnikova M. The Psychology of Distrusting G.M.O.s. THE NEW YORKER. 2013.</A></SPAN></SPAN>.  A reverse halo effect is defined by the unconscious creation of a negative assumption based on a positive evaluation. In this case, the positive evaluation, would be the ensured purity and health benefits of GMO foods, where the negative assumption would be the concerns for <I>unnaturalness</I>.
So we detect a tendency in the public to follow a reverse halo effect, which is most often associated with GMO foods. The problem we face today, is the continuation of this reverse halo effect, where the public would receive any GMO device negatively, simply by association to the word GMO. So how do we change this dynamic between GMO and the public? 
The conclusion we reached was that in order to change a tendency in public opinion, it was important to educate the coming generations on the possibilities of GMO. Another important aspect seemed to be a general perception of GMO as an unnatural element that would harm both humans and nature alike. As such, we wanted to illustrate how GMO could be used, not to harm nature, but to help lead it towards a more sustainable future. So, we set out to teach children of all ages about GMO in general, as well as about our own PowerLeaf, to show them that this concept, which is considered to be unnatural, could actually be used to help nature.

One of the high school students suggested that the Powerleaf should be able to rotate according to the sun, to ensure maximum exposure and outcome. We took this brilliant advice into consideration and contacted Robot Systems Engineer student, Oliver Klinggaard, who helped us with the potential implementation of a pan/tilt system. He provided us with his recent project report on the subject, as well as a description of the adjustments required for the implementation in our system, which you can find <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/9/99/T--SDU-Denmark--PanTilt-system.pdf" target="_blank">here</A>.

As part of our iGEM project we wanted to raise awareness on synthetic biology. As such it seemed beneficial to have a successful social media strategy. The motivation for such a strategy came from the knowledge that social media in general has a large influence on people, especially the younger generation.

The design of our logo consisting of a light font and a picture of a leaf combined with an electrical plug, was determined in the start of April. We sought to make a simple logo that showed the essence of our project, The PowerLeaf, not only in name but in brand as well.

During spring we narrowed down the relevant hashtags of our Twitter and Instagram to #science, #igem, #sdu, #gmo, and #forsksdu. These hashtags were used at relevant occasions and generally helped expanding our reach on social media. A few times we even used a couple of silly hashtags like #adventuretime and #lifechoices when we found it appropriate.

A complete relaunch of our social media platforms was made in the start of April. One of the changes we made was the setup of the Facebook page and Twitter account, that we changed to resemble an enterprise.
</P><P class="P-Larger"><B> Results</B></P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><P> Looking at Figure 1 we see the number of followers on our Facebook page throughout the year. There is a sharp increase around the start of April, this correlate nicely with the relaunch of our social media. Since we started using the Facebook page on March 1<SUP>st</SUP>, we have seen an increase of followers on 44%.

Figure 2 shows the number of unique interactions with our Facebook posts each day. Some posts gained around 200 interactions per day, while the highest amount of interactions per day was seen at end of April. This high amount of interactions correlates with us being at the Danish Science Festival, where we inoculated bacteria from the fingers of the attendants on agar plates. The photo gallery of these plates was widely shared on our Facebook page, and it probably was the reason for the rise in amounts of interactions.

During the summer, we realised that an increasing fraction of our followers on Facebook were non-Danish speakers. Therefore, we set out to analyse the distribution of first languages among our followers seen in Figure 3, which showed that one in three of our followers were not speaking Danish as their first language. This data led to us switching the language used in our Facebook posts from Danish to English. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="figure-text"><P><B>Figure 1.</B> Number of followers on our Facebook page throughout the year.</P></DIV><DIV class="figure-text"><P><B>Figure 2. </B> Unique interactions per day on our Facebook page. </P></DIV><DIV class="figure-text"><P><B>Figure 3.</B> Distribution of first language among our followers</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>On the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of September a commercial about our project aired on the website and Facebook page of the University of Southern Denmark. We made this commercial in collaboration with the communications department of the University of Southern Denmark, specifically a producer named Anders Boe. It was seen 27,526 times, which is equivalent to 16% of our hometowns population. The click-through rate was around 10%, which is much greater than the average rate of videos on their Facebook page. The commercial led to random people, including doctors on the hospital of Odense, asking team members about the project and about GMO in general. With all this in mind it seems fair to state that the commercial was a smash hit of our human outreach and our engagement in the social media. In combination with our easily recognisable logo and our human outreach initiatives, we have been using our social media as a platform to show interest in synthetic biology and for sharing our work.

After seeing the commercial a local newspaper reached out to us to bring an interview in their Saturday special <SPAN class="reference"><SPAN class="referencetext"><A target="blank" href="https://www.fyens.dk/indland/Forsoemt-sommer-Studerende-bruger-ferien-paa-solceller-af-bakterier/artikel/3180933">Newspaper article from Fyens.dk (Danish)</A></SPAN></SPAN>. In collaboration with the student media RUST and Beton TV we have been featured in their magazine and a video of our attendance in Boston will be shown on their Facebook page briefly after our return. This is done to ensure an awareness of the iGEM competition among the students on the University of Southern Denmark. We hope this will inspire a lot of students to apply for the iGEM team next year, since it is a hallmark of the SDU-Denmark team to be interdisciplinary.

The effort put into our social media strategy and our goal of following it has paid off. Social media has shaped our outreach and made it possible for us to talk about iGEM and our project to people we did not know. Several times our outreach has led us to public discussion of GMO and solar panels due to persons contacting us, wanting to know more.
