A total of seven members from these two teams joined us for breakfast and attended our meetup. This was the first ever iGEM meetup hosted by our university, so we decided to make it memorable. We took advantage of our interdisciplinary team roster, and thus designed <SPAN class="highlighted">a wiki and ethics workshop to aid our fellow Danish teams</SPAN>. 

We utilised the broad interdisciplinary profile of our team, to have Emil S. and Lene <SPAN class="highlighted">present the perception of science throughout the history and the meta-bioethical aspects of GMO</SPAN>, respectively. Emil S. has a Bachelor of Arts in History, and Lene has a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. The ethical presentation was purposely turned into an ethical debate, where viewpoints of ethical conduct were exchanged and discussed. After the presentations and discussions on metaethics, it was time for the wiki workshop.

The SDU-Denmark iGEM teams have won the Best Wiki prize several times in the past. As such, we wanted to share the knowledge gained from our university's experience. To facilitate this exchange of knowledge on wiki development, we recruited our current supervisor Thøger Jensen Krogh, to facilitate presentations on how to design a good wiki page. Thøger was qualified for this task through his role as the designer of the SDU iGEM 2013 and 2014 team wikis, both of which won the special prize on both occasions. During the presentation, Thøger had arranged several exercises where <SPAN class="highlighted">the attendees got to mingle, discuss and evaluate their wikis. This resulted in a steady flow of information and constructive feedback between all three teams</SPAN>. 

After a long day of learning and discussing, we went for a tour around campus under the summer sun. This concluded in a visit to the roof terrace of the campus dormitory, followed by dinner. It was requested, by our fellow Danish teams, to make the SDU meetup an iGEM tradition. 
    </P><P class="P-Larger"><SPAN class="highlighted"><B>Attending Meetups</B></SPAN></P><P>Besides hosting our own meetup, <SPAN class="highlighted">we also attended several meetups during our iGEM experience</SPAN>. The first of which, was the 5th Annual Biobrick Workshop in March, hosted by the Technical University of Denmark, DTU-Denmark. This meetup not only gave us our first experience with Biobricks, but also worked as a foundation for friendships across different teams.

Our second meetup, the Nordic iGEM Conference was hosted by the University of Copenhagen, UCopenhagen, and took place in June. The main focus of this meetup was the traditional mini Jamboree. Participating in this  meetup gave us useful feedback from both the judges as well as from our fellow iGEM teams. This helped us greatly to shape and develop our project for the better.

To celebrate the beginning of our iGEM summer, we went on a road trip to attend the European Meetup, hosted by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Here we discussed ideas regarding our project at a poster session, and learned about all the other great iGEM projects. We also made new friends from all over Europe.
</P><P class="P-Larger"><SPAN class="highlighted"><B>Further Collaboration</B></SPAN></P><P>In regard to our project, we have <SPAN class="highlighted">been in contact with the iGEM teams from Bielefeld and Imperial College, who helped us by sending crucial parts, relevant to the execution of our project</SPAN>. 

As our project revolves around global warming and green sustainable energy, we were thrilled to hear about <SPAN class="highlighted">the iGEM Goes Green initiative made by the TU Dresden iGEM team</SPAN>. Following their guidelines, we have calculated the carbon footprint of our laboratory work and travelling. We have, in part, tried to make up for our carbon footprint, by changing our travelling and eating habits in our everyday lives. Furthermore, <SPAN class="highlighted">we have reduced our daily electricity consumption, our wiki became CO<SUB>2</SUB> neutral, and we made an effort to sort our waste</SPAN>. The full report can be scrutinised <SPAN class="btn-link btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#about-igem-goes-green">here</SPAN>. Due to our team being the most green <I>dream</I> team, TU-Dresden asked us to lead the iGEM Goes Green project in year 2018. 
<SPAN class="highlighted">We sought expertise from the Macquarie Australia iGEM team</SPAN>, who has worked with the implementation of photosynthesis in <I>E. coli</I> since 2013. We had an interesting Skype call with their team, where we discussed the particular challenges their previous teams had experienced throughout their projects. 

We were also <SPAN class="highlighted">able to help the Stony Brook iGEM team by facilitating communication with members of the SDU iGEM team from 2016</SPAN>. 

During our project we received several questionnaires from fellow iGEM teams. We were <SPAN class="highlighted">delighted to help the teams by answering their questionnaires</SPAN>. These included from:</P><UL class="list"><LI>Waterloo - regarding 3D printing of lab equipment</LI><LI>Dalhousie - regarding the common conception of science literature</LI><LI>University of Washington - regarding communication platforms used by teams</LI><LI>Vilnius-Lithuania - regarding cotransformation</LI><LI>Nanjing-China - regarding a whole-cell sensor for formaldehyde</LI><LI>University of Sydney - regarding the use and accessibility of insulin</LI><LI>Georgia State - regarding disabilities</LI><LI>Greece - regarding modular RNAi-based logic circuits</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
