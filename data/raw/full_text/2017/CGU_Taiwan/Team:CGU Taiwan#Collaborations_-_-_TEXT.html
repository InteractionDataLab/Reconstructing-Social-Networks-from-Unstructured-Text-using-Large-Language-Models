This summer, we met TAS_Taipei when we were participating the Asia Pacific iGEM conference raised by NCTU_Formosa. we are currently working on an improvement of the reprocessed paper manufacturing process. we had found the process “flotation” could cause severe paper fiber lost, which is a big problem for preserving paper fibers. After we saw TAS_Taipei presentation of how biofilm could attract nano gold particles, they were excited about whether the biofilm could absorb ink particles. Their idea might give the potential of replacing current flotation process which would cause paper fiber lost and chemical pollution. We had discuss for collaboration of improving the process. They had test the biofilm absorption of ink particles provided by our project built up protocols.
To sum up, our experiment shows the potential of attracting ink particles. That is, in future imagination, biofilm could be the candidate material for replacing the current method.
We helped TAS_Taipei independently verify that overexpression of OmpR234 (BBa_K2229200) produces more biofilms than control (BBa_K342003)
(caption) Figure 3-19: A) Our experiment results showed that E. coli overexpressing OmpR234(BBa_K2229200) is producing more biofilm than a control which does not overexpress OmpR234(BBa_K342003). B) CGU_Taiwan independently tested our constructs using crystal violet, a dye commonly used to quantify biofilm formation. BBa_K2229200 showed higher absorbance compared to the control BBa_K342003, reflecting a the formation of more biofilm, which matches our results.
