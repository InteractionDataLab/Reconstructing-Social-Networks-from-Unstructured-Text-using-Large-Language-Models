Measurement
In order to define the efficiency of deinking, we have standardized the grayscale of paper into the scores, 1 to 100. The color of the image in digitals is defined into 256 RGB CSS codes. Thus, we apply a formula to standardize the every result from reprocessed paper.
Therefore the value of sample can be standardize into 0-100 to help the user to compare the result of the reprocessed paper.
Results
Figure1. the paper printed with different black surface area
Every result has been standardized by its situation to avoid systematic error. Therefore, we can see that the paper with highest black area has most variation due to there are much ink in the solution. To solve the problem, we narrow down the reaction volume, but keep the concentration of paper pulp to avoid the lost in every require of production.
