2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference CGU X NTHU
On July 17 2017, CGU_Taiwan held 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference!
On that day, 7 Taiwanese teams gather in Chang Gung University and share their projects to each other. The purpose of holding Taiwan Conference is because we want to build up a close connection between teams in Taiwan, thus, provide more opportunities for team brainstorming and collaboration. In this event, we build a large scale pipetman to symbolize our spirit_ to use synthetic biology to change the world.
This one day meet-up event includes brainstorming activities, project presentation and lecture. For the lecture part, we had invited Dr. Wong Chi Huey, the Distinguished Research Fellow from Genomics Research Center, Academia Silica. He shared about his research on Saccharides synthesis and guide us to explore the possibility and future work of synthetic biology. We appreciate for Dr. Wong’s sharing and coming, the speech did broaden the Taiwan iGEMers’ horizons and help us grow.
For the accomplishment of this conference, we would like to appreciate NTHU_Taiwan for collaborating with us and hold this event together. NTHU_Taiwan designed interesting team activities and help everyone know each other as soon as possible through games in the morning of the event. While planning the activity, CGU_Taiwan had also visited NTHU in Hsinchu, hoping through creative talk, we can cooperate well and provide a best conference to Taiwan iGEMers. Lastly, we did it! We appreciate for the collaboration with NTHU_Taiwan.
iGEM and synthetic biology are needed to be promoted, therefore, CGU_Taiwan regards the connection between Taiwanese teams and successfully built it up.
