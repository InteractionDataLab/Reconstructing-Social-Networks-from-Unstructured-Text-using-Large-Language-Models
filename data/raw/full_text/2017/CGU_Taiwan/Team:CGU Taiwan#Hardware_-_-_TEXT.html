Hardware
It is localizing the reaction of enzyme on the paper that can reach two goals, reducing the pollution from deinking and maintaining the fibers without inks to keep the strength of the reprocessed paper. Thus, we have created a new device to reform the procedure to make reprocessed paper. Briefly describing the function of the device, the paper will be drew into the box and taken a picture to be analyzed the distribution of the surface area of ink. Then, the engineered yeast will be sprayed on the ink part on the paper to be induced to secrete out enzyme only on the ink part. Thus, the enzyme can be precisely working on the ink part of the paper to preserve the other fibers without the ink on the paper. Additionally, our concept has been confirmed by the pro cedure we made reprocessed paper in lab. We believe our enzymatic deinking process can fulfill our dream with this innovative device.
Structure
The structure of the main part is made of acrylic sheets which are joined with chloroform. Since chloroform welds plastic, it gives the device well stability. For the LED lights, circuit boards are stablized on acrylic sheet drilled.
Component Description
In the following paragraphs, our device will be dismantled into single components and their functions will be explained respectively.
Case
Our device is like an opaque box with a cover on the top and two drawers. Opaque box with internal dimension about 18 cm in width, 20 cm in length and 19 cm in height offers a dim environment which avoids the yeast being induced out of control.
Baseplate
It is located at the bottom of the device. Paper will be placed on it and sent into the case to be analyzed and deinked. The length and width of the plate are both the same as  the LED matrix, so paper that is not oversized can apply to the machine.
LightSource
LED light strips with great uniformity of clean white light source provides a clear view of photographing, followed up by analyzing ink spots.
Smart Phone
The phone is placed on the top of the device, with the lense targeting the hole for photographing. After the paper is photographed, the picture will be sent to the computer for analyzing.
Yeast Spray Bottle
Our biological engineered yeast will be filled in the pressure watering bottle which is acid and alkali-resistant. The spray nozzle connected with a stainless steel water pipe is installed on the top cover of the device.
LED Matrix
Circuits, software
On the computer
Our image process program using OpenCV function library to decode the JPG image file and do the edge offset, then decide which area have ink. There are two rules for which LED have to be light up. If the pixel which RGB value lower than the general color threshold over a specific percentage of an unit area, or the pixel which RGB value lower than the extreme color threshold over a specific small percentage of an unit area, then the correspond LED will be light up.
Arduino and circuits
We used Arduino to control the LED matrix in this device. Arduino collect the serial data from the usb port, and send it to the Max7219 microcontroller to light up LED matrix.
