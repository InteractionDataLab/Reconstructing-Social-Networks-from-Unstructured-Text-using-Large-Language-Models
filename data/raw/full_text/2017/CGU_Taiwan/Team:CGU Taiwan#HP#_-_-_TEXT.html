Overview
This year, CGU_Taiwan had devoted ourselves to protect timber resource through maximize the use of fibers in paper industry. In current paper recycling process, we had found two major shortcomings in the deinking step. First, the chemicals used to deink cause water pollution to our environment. Second, adding those chemicals in paper pulp reduce the length and strength of most fibers. Therefore, CGU_Taiwan wanted to improve the recycle process of paper, and provided a brand new deinking device to model the availability of our design. Instead of using traditional deinking agent, we apply the yeast which is engineered to secrete enzymes through red light stimulation to deink paper. In this way, ink can be specifically separated from fibers without any damage on white area of paper. We preserve the most quantity of fibers and implement a more eco-friendly method than current process.
