      To apply our design in paper industry, we not only need to know the needs from paper factories, but also have to provide product that fits public expectation. Therefore, our team had done a survey on public for asking if they would be willing to purchase bio-deinked paper with higher price. The result shows that up to 90% of people are willing to buy product which is more friendly to our environment; however, this decision will be negatively affected due to high price. During the survey, we had realized that only through the education of environmental protection can people put it into practice. Therefore, for public engagement, we would like to introduce how we invent bio-deinking process through genetic engineered technique, and how we protect timber resource through our bio-deinking process.</P><H1 id="pModel">Sharing Bio-deinking Process With Dong-An Elementary School </H1><P style="font-size:120%;">
    The purpose of public engagement is to make people understand the importance and advantage of bio-deinking process. Therefore, in May 2017, we went to Dong-An Elementary School and provide a series of paper making activities for them. Through interesting games and recycled paper DIY, kids started to know more about paper and how it was made. Later, we shared our enzyme deinking project to them, and explained the relationship between high value and cost. At the end of the activity, many children had told us that they are willing to save money and purchase expensive but eco-friendly paper, because it’s better for the forest and environment.</P><H1 id="pDevice">Promote Synthetic Biology to National Taoyuan Senior High School</H1><P style="font-size:120%;">
    In Taiwan, seldom high student could have the opportunity to learn the usage of pipetman. Therefore, to promote synthetic biology to young student, we taught students from Nation Taoyuan Senior High School how to use pipetman and SDS page, which are the basic tools used in molecular biology experiment. Through manipulating tools by themselves, they got to know more concepts about how synthetic biology work.

In August 2017, we collaborated with NYMU iGEM team and held a meeting to introduce iGEM competition to students from Taipei Wego. The students were so curious and excited about our bio-deinking method and how we construct our yeast. In this meeting, we not only share our project, but also foster young students to participate in this wonderful competition.

Participating in 2017 Science Carnival provided us a great opportunity to educate the public. We wanted to make people understand the importance of fiber preservation, and how we achieve high preservation ratio through using enzymes to deink. Popularizing our design and let people value timber resource, we need people to put environmental protection into practice.

In July 2017, CGU_Taiwan had collaborated with NTHU iGEM team and held <B>2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference CGU X NTHU</B>. The original aspiration of holding this event is because every year there are about ten Taiwan teams participate in iGEM competition. Therefore, we believe that Taiwan should have our own event. This year, seven Taiwan undergraduate teams come to Chang Gung University, and this one-day event can be divided to four parts_ brainstorm, lunch party, lecture and presentation.
