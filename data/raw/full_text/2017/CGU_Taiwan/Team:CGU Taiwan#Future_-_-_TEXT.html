Future Work
In future world, natural resources would be restricted and cannot be made into new products. That is, reusing resources is a goal of technology development. To deal with cost and efficiency issues, we had designed a large scale factory model based on our modeling and small scale device. After the recycled paper was sent into the factory, classification was first done before all the process has started. Papers would be separated into different lines by the type of printed ink, the color of printed ink, dirtiness and the percentage of ink area. Then the paper would be pictured and sprayed with yeast using massive yeast spraying system. the paper would go onto conveyor and shine with red light. The paper would be fluently sent into the pulping step for further treatment. The design of the factory would lowered the cost and raise the specificity and efficiency. We wish to make a change of current reprocessed paper manufacturing process.
