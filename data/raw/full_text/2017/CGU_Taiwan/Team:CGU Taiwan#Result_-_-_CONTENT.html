The invention of paper allowed human to record knowledge and spread information rapidly. In modern world, the enormous amount of paper usage is decreasing the tree density around the globe. Paper reuse is a strategy of reducing tree cut, but recycling paper isn’t an easy job. Paper are made of different fibers depending on the manufacturing process, and printed with different inks. These reasons increase the difficulty of turning the pulp clean and ready for use. Deinking is the process which separates the ink and paper fiber during the cleanup of reprocessed paper pulp. The deinking process in the industry use chemical reagents like detergent, alkali which would cause water pollution and air pollution. Our plan is to replace the chemical reagents with biological enzymes, turning the waste into an environmentally friendly organic compound. We are going to create a controllable enzyme secrete system which would extend the limit of deinking and be more eco-friendly. </P><P style="font-size:150%">Paper is one of the most common natural resources we used in everyday life.
