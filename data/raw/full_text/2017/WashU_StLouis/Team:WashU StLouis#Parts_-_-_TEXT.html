Our Parts
Our team designed several parts that are intended to confer resistance to UV-B radiation in E. coli. Our basic parts encode radiation-resistance proteins, while our composite parts combine these proteins with an inducible Lac reporter and blue chromoprotein, a reporter.
Basic Parts
These basic parts are all coding sequences that came from foreign organisms, and we hoped would confer radiation resistance to E. Coli and our Cyanobacteria strain

Part Function
Dsup
BBa_K2195000
Tardigrade DNA binding protein, provides radiation resistance
phrAc
BBa_K2195001
Cyanobacteria DNA photolyase, provides radiation resistance
phrAt
BBa_K2195006
Tardigrade DNA photolyase, provides radiation resistance
Composite Parts
Two of our composite parts contain Lac-inducible forms of our resistance genes. One is a reporter using the Blue Chromoprotein that we used as a control. The last is an antibiotic resistance gene that we improved by optimizing for E. Coli
