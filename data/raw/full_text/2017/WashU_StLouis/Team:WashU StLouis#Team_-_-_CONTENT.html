Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the WashU iGEM team, master of all the sciences, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they were busy making competent cells. </P><P style="padding:1vw; text-align:center; font-size:1.5vw"> The WashU iGEM team is proud to have a diverse set of backgrounds and interests, including hailing from seven different states and Iowa (which is less of a state and more of an extended field of corn). We participate in activities ranging from building Rube Goldberg machines to teaching freshmen chemistry to putting on plays in a basement. Some of our team believes that <STRONG>&quot;gif&quot;</STRONG> is pronounced <STRONG>&quot;jif&quot;</STRONG>, while others hold firm that the &quot;g&quot; is pronounced like the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;gradient PCR&quot;. By bringing together this ragtag group of science-lovers, we have formed an impressive group of researchers who enjoy working with each other almost as much as they enjoy lab work. After all, the only bonds stronger than the bonds of chemistry are the bonds of friendship &lt;3</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV class="heading"><H1 style="color:#5B965B"> Team Members </H1></DIV><DIV style="text-align:center;height:16.5vw;margin:1vw;border:0.45vw dotted #93efea; background-color:#d6f9f7;  width:90%; float:right"><DIV style="float:right;width:78%;padding:1vw 0vw 0vw 0vw"><H2 style="color:#66A7A3">Alex Yenkin</H2><P style="font-size:1vw;"><STRONG>Junior | Human Practices Coordinator / Wet Lab | Major: Genomics and Computational Biology | Minor: Anthropology </STRONG></P><P style="font-size:1vw;"> Alex is a Biology major from the northern suburbs of Chicago, and is passionate about the superiority of deep dish pizza. In addition to being a part of iGEM, he is a volunteer coordinator for the student organization Partners in East St. Louis and is involved with the student theater group Cast n' Crew. Alex loves most aspects of biology and could see himself as a neuroscientist or a biostatistician or anything else in between, but he is totally content to spend the rest of his life doing crosswords.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style="text-align:center;height:16.5vw;margin:1vw;border:0.45vw dotted #93efea; background-color:#d6f9f7; width:90%; float:left"><DIV style="float:left;width:78%;padding:1vw 0vw 0vw 0vw"><H2 style="color:#66A7A3">Collin Kilgore</H2><P style="font-size:1vw;"><STRONG> Sophomore | Experimental Design Specialist / Wet Lab | Major: Chemical Engineering and Mathematics </STRONG></P><P style="font-size:1vw;"> Hailing from Des Moines, Iowa, Collin is interested in the systems biology end of Chemical Engineering and plans to pursue graduate work in the field. In addition to iGEM, Collin is a Calculus Peer Led Team Learning leader, Washington University Student Advocate, and member of WashU's After Dark a Capella. When he is not humming along to random songs in lab, Collin can often be found binge-watching shows on Netflix and dreaming about genetically-engineered corn.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style="text-align:center;height:16.5vw;margin:1vw;border:0.45vw dotted #93efea; background-color:#d6f9f7; width:90%; float:right"><DIV style="float:right;width:78%;padding:1vw 0vw 0vw 0vw"><H2 style="color:#66A7A3">Maddie Lee</H2><P style="font-size:1vw;"><STRONG> Junior | Financial Coordinator and Treasurer / Wet Lab / Team Social Media Goddess | Major: Biology </STRONG></P><P style="font-size:1vw;"> Maddie is a Minnesotan girl in a St. Louis world. She is studying biology and plans to pursue a PhD in pathology after graduating from WashU. In addition to iGEM, Maddie is a member of the executive board for the student theater group Cast n' Crew, a volunteer with Studio: TESLA, and a member of Alpha Omicron Pi. Additionally, she would like to note that according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

Developing this wiki is Mark's first coding experience, but he's enjoying the process of learning HTML and CSS in addition to performing wet lab experiments. When he's not studying or working on iGEM, Mark is a shift captain for Campus Kitchen, a volunteer at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and a coach for Campus Y's Science Olympiad program. On his free time, you can find Mark watching basketball and baseball, swimming, enjoying sunsets, or staring off into the distance contemplating the intricacies of life.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style="text-align:center;height:16.5vw;margin:1vw;border:0.45vw dotted #93efea; background-color:#d6f9f7; width:90%; float:right"><DIV style="float:right;width:78%;padding:1vw 0vw 0vw 0vw"><H2 style="color:#66A7A3">Micah Rickles-Young</H2><P style="font-size:1vw;"><STRONG> Senior | Modeling and Hardware Specialist / Wet Lab | Major: Genomics and Computational Biology | Minor: Bioinformatics </STRONG></P><P style="font-size:1vw;">Three years after attending the 2014 High School Jamboree with his team from Weston, Massachusetts, Micah makes his triumphant return to iGEM.
