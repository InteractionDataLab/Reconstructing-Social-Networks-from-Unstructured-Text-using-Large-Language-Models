Our goal was to transform cells so that they could resist high levels of UV-B radiation. We wanted to not only test our cells in a lab setting, but also in a setting that was near to what they might face in the real world, as we could not take them out of the lab. Using our Environmental Simulation System, we were able to expose our constructs to high levels of UV-B radiation which is more than what they would face in the environment. In addition, we were also able to control the temperature, level of light, and monitor the humidity to match real world conditions.
As shown on our results page, our cell constructs with Dsup were able to survive under increased levels of UV-B radiation, while wild type cells were not. Our part worked the way it was designed to, and exhibited increased resistance to UV-B radiation under real world conditions.
