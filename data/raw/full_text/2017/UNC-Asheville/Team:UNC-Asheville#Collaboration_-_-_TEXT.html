With a little help.
We had to learn a lot during this project. Luckily, a few kind souls decided to help us out.
The Conference
The Mid-Atlantic iGEM Conference at the University of Virginia.
Advice
We don't get to talk to people who know about synthetic biology in real life that much, going to a small liberal arts college. So it was an absolute treat to go to the University of Virginia and talk to domain experts and motivated students
.
Gibson Assembly
No one in our institution has even performed a Gibson Assembly, so when we decided to use it as our primary assembly technique we were more than a little nervous. Luckily, the UVA iGEM team are old hands at Gibson Assembly and were able to give us some guided direction in the design and troubleshooting of primers and assembly technique
Soluble Methane Monooxygenase, kind of difficult
Our chosen methanaphile and lynchpin of our project proved difficult to worth with. The Universtiy of Virginia actually had a graduate student from the Heidelburg Team that created the original sMMO part.  From this advice we were able to better understand how we wanted to express sMMO.
