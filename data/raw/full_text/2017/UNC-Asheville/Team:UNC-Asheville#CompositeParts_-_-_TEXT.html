dhlB
dhlB2_Lac_Inducible
dhlB2 is a haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase isolated from the Xantobacter autotrophicus strain GJ10. It is active on a number of halogenated alkanes including chloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid.
This basic part was characterized by the SydneyUni_2013 iGEM team but the part sequenced poorly and was never made a biobrick. The UNCA_2017 iGEM team had this part synthesized by Genscript after including a double promoter region (Anderson weak + lac, BBa_J23114 BBa_R0011) and a double terminator region (B0010, B0012)
soluble Methane Monooxygenase
sMMO
sMMO_1
soluble methane monooxygenase is a strong oxidizing protein that catalyzes methane to methanol in methanophile bacteria. The biobrick BBa_K1390019 was a complete composite part of sMMO that included all 6 subunits downstream of weak RBS (B0032). The part was lac inducible via BBa_R0011 and included a double terminator region with B0010 and B0012.
Unfortunately, this biobrick had a bad read and was never confirmed as a part. Our team attempted to create this biobrick once and for all. sMMO1 is the first half and includes the promoter region, plus the coding regions of mmoX and mmoY.
sMMO_2
soluble methane monooxygenase is a strong oxidizing protein that catalyzes methane to methanol in methanophile bacteria. The biobrick BBa_K1390019 was a complete composite part of sMMO that included all 6 subunits downstream of weak RBS (B0032). The part was lac inducible via BBa_R0011 and included a double terminator region with B0010 and B0012.
Unfortunately, this biobrick had a bad read and was never confirmed as a part. Our team attempted to create this biobrick once and for all. sMMO2 is the second half and includes the coding regions for mmoB, mmoZ, mmoD and mmoC (BBa_K1390001, BBa_K1390006, BBa_K1390003,BBa_K1390002) and the terminators BBa_B0010, BBa_B0012
