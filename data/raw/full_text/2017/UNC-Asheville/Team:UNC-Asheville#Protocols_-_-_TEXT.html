Protocols used by 2017 UNC-Asheville iGEM.
Agar Plate Pouring
Autoclave
Water bath
Pipetman
- 37 g pre-mixed powder consisting of:
5 g peptone
10.0 g peptone from casein
10.0 g sodium chloride
12.0 g agar-agar
1 L Sterile H2O
Sterile plates of your desired size - we usually use 60 mm x 15 mm plates which can hold 5-10 mL of agar and on which you can individually distinguish a maximum of ~100 colonies *Pro-Tip* If you will be screening a large number of colonies, we recommend using larger plates. Many labs use 100 mm x 15 mm plates which can hold 10 - 15 mL of agar. Autoclavable flasks Sterile pipettes Ice bucket to hold antibiotic Antibiotic at 1000 x concentration disolved in the appropriate liquid solvent. See table to the right for appropriate antibiotic concentrations.
