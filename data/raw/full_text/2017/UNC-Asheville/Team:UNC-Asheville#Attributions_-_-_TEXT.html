Let's find out who we need to yell at.
A Disclaimer
In comparison to most schools, this list will look sparse. Our team was composed of four motivated people, and was driven by and for students. While we received advice from many, our triumphs and failures lie squarely on our shoulders.
Wetwork
Nicholas White was responsible for overall project design and implementation. He designed the plasmids, created experiment protocols, and performed the bulk of the labwork.
Katie Brown performed wetlab protocols pertaining to bacterial cultures, restriction, ligation and experiment visualization and confirmation.
William Jackson performed tasks related to sample prep, PCR, lab management, creation and repair of lab equipment.
En Silico
Nicholas White was responsible for plasmid design, protocol design, and experiment implementation.
William Jackson was responsible for the wiki, implementation of the model and iGEM deliverables.
Jonathon Deutsch was responsible for mathematical representation of the model and research.
Human Practices
Katie Brown was responsible for Human Practices Programming and Content.
William Jackson was responsible for arranging logistics for Human Practices .
