InterLab Study
Overview
Directly comparing measurements is a challenge for many synthetic biology researchers. Fluorescent measurement is difficult for researchers to compare because it can be analyzed and reported in a variety of ways. Through the InterLab 2017 study, the iGEM Measurement Committee seeks to provide researchers with a standard for measuring expression of GFP in a plate reader.
iGEM Teams worldwide contributed to the InterLab study by transforming DH5a E. coli with six test devices (BBa_J364000, BBa_J364001, BBa_J364002, BBa_J364003, BBa_J364004, and BBa_J364005), as well as a positive (BBa_I20270), and negative control (BBa_R0040). Teams then measured the fluorescence of the bacteria in a plate reader over a 6-hour period.

Fluorescein Fluorescence Standard Curve
Materials
fluorescein
10ml 1xPBS
96 well plate, black with flat, transparent/clear bottom
Methods
Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 uM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of 1xPBS
Prepare 1mL of 50 uM (1x) fluorescein solution by diluting 500 uL of the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 500 uL of 1xPBS
Conduct serial dilutions of fluorescein in the well plate
100 uL of PBS added into wells A2, B2, C2, D2... A12, B12
200 uL of fluorescein 1x stock solution added to A1, B1, C1, D1
100 uL fluorescein stock solution transferred from A1 into A2
A2 mixed by pipetting up and down, then 100 uL transferred to A3
A3 mixed by pipetting up and down, then 100 uL transferred to A4
Continue through A11, DO NOT continue dilution into A12
Step 3 repeated for rows B-D
Fluorescence for all samples measured using the plate reader
Cell Measurements: Day 1
Materials
Competent cells (Escherichia coli strain DH5α)
LB media
Chloramphenicol
Incubator at 37°C
Devices
BBa_J364000
BBa_J364001
BBa_J364002
BBa_J364003
BBa_J364004
BBa_J364005
BBa_I20270
BBa_R0040
Methods
Locate the devices listed above in the distribution kit and resuspend them in 10uL of dH20
Transform each device into 50uL of competent cells
Plate the transformations onto LB plates with chloramphenicol and incubate overnight at 37C
Cell Measurements: Day 2
Materials
LB broth
Chloramphenicol
16 50 ml Falcon tubes
Aluminum Foil
Transformed Cells
Inoculating Loops
Methods
Two colonies were selected from each of plate and inoculated it in 5 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol in separate 50 ml Falcon Tubes. The Falcon tubes were then covered tightly with foil. The cells were grown overnight (16 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Cell Measurements: Day 3
Materials
Overnight Cultures
Luria Broth
Chloramphenicol
1.5 ml eppendorf tubes for sample storage
Ice bucket with ice
Pipettes
96 well plate, black with flat, transparent/clear bottom
Methods
1 mL of each culture was pipetted into a cuvette for an OD600 reading, which was then used for the Dilution Calculations in the Excel sheet provided by iGEM
Each culture was diluted to a target OD of 0.02 in 12 mL of LB media + chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tubes wrapped in foil
Cultures were placed in incubator at 37ºC and 220 rpm
500 µL samples of the cultures were taken at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation. (At each time point, a sample was taken from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a total of 16 samples per time point)
At each time point, the OD and fluorescence of the samples were measured
