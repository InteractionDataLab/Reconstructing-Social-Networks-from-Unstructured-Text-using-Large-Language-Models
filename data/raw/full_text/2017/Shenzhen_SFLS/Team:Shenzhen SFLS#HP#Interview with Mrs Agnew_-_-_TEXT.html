Interview with Mrs Agnew&action
Claudia C. Agnew is licensed to practice medicine under physician supervision and has her license from the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners. Experienced in family medicine, pediatrics, and women’s health, Claudia’s               background includes providing healthcare to the Spanish speaking community. She has a certification in Medical Spanish Translation from the Alabama Department of Public Health.
Mrs Agnew shared some targeted therapy that are currently used for cancer such as AVASTIN, HERBETIM, RITUSAM. With these precedents, we were highly encouraged by that we were working on a project that is good for people.
From the interview, we got to know that melanoma is also a devastating disease in America, and the targeted therapy is welcomed. If the therapy works effectively, the patient will try.
From the conversation, we learned that many people would get frustrated when the cancer spreads to other parts of the body or they cannot afford the treatment. We also learned that there are generally two kinds of treatments - standard treatment   and targeted therapy.
