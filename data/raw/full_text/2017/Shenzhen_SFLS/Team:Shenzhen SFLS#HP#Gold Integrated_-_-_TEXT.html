Former Project — Treatment of Trichophyton rubrum infection by β-human defensin-3.
We chose Trichophyton rubrum as our project at first for it is widely spread in a large amount of certain type of people and lack of efficient and simple treatment.

Changing Direction
After public survey and discussions with experts, we came to the conclusion that the project on Trichophyton rubrum study was almost infeasible. Meanwhile, through the investigation and communication, we found that skin cancer needed more public attentions. So we decided to shift the focus of our project from Trichophyton rubrum to skin cancer.
