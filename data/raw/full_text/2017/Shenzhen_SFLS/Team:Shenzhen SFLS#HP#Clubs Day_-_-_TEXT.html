Clubs Day
We held the Clubs Day twice after our term formed (December,2016)and created a lot of activities to let more classmates to know about us.
We prepared some questions about biology and genetic engineering for students. We hoped that the activities could arouse their interest in these(biology and genetic engineering)and let more students get to know more about biology. We draw a science comic and printed 200 copies of it . There are many interesting and funny contents and relaxing paintings in the comic. We also prepared some goods which are related to biology.Meanwhile, the school broadcasting station interviewed us on the Clubs Day and introduced our team to all the students in the school.
