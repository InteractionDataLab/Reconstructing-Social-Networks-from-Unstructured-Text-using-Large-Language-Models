Help from Dr. Xiaoqiang Guo
During the experiment in our project, we encountered a problem of DNA sequencing. The result tented to be confusing. We couldn’t tell whether the mutant BRAF in melanoma cells had been cleaved. It seriously influenced our experiment process, so we asked for the experienced expert for help. Dr. Xiaoqiang Guo from Peking University suggested that we can solve this problem by using TA cloning assay. With his help, we got satisfactory results.
