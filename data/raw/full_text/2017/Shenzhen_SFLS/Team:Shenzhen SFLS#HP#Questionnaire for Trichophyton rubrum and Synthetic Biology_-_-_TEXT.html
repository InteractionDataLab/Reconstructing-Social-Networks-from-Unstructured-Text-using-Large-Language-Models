Questionnaire for Trichophyton rubrum and Synthetic Biology
Summary
Question 1
Question 2
Question 3
Conclusion
Trichophyton rubrum, a type of Trichophyton, is the most common cause of skin superficial fungal disease. Therefore, we designed a questionnaire for Trichophyton rubrum, which consisted of 13 questions that were closely related to daily life.             In the survey, we also asked the public about iGEM and synthetic biology. The questionnaire was distributed on April 1st, 2017 and took back on April 30th, 2017. The representative questions and results of survey were as follows.
Question 1：Have you ever heard of skin ringworm?
Result: The survey showed that most of the people had heard of skin ringworm and thought that the modern treatments could effectively relieve the symptoms. Most people would buy medicine at hospitals or chain pharmacies. They knew somewhat about             what causes the disease.
Question 2：Have you ever heard of the synthetic biology？
Result: 33.96% of the public had not heard of synthetic biology before.
Question 3：If synthetic biology technology applies to treatment, would you be willing to try?
Result: 86.79% of people in the survey showed the willingness to try new medicines to verify whether it was effective.
Conclusion
Although most people know little about biology technology and skin ringworm, They are willing to try new treatments. We realize that we should enhance the knowledge and awareness of the public on this aspect. In this case, we are willing to             do more publicity work and activities in the future.
