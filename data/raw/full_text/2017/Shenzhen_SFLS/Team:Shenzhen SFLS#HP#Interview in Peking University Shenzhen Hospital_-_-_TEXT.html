Interview in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital
On June 17, 2017, we had an interview with Dr. Boran Cheng, an expert in the Department of Oncology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital. From the communication, we learnt: 1) Current primary treatment of cancer is surgery; 2) Early diagnosis significantly improve the survival rate of patients; 3) Gene therapy and immunotherapy may cure cancer in the future. About CRISPR/CAS9 system in the treatment of cancer, Dr. Cheng believed that it is a promising therapy, but there will be a long way to go for its development.
