We applied for Twitter and uploaded our trends as quickly as possible in order to record the steps our team made. Meanwhile, we updated our official accounts irregularly to introduce the teamwork and the process of our program. Sometimes,               we would send some articles about synthetic biology. Also, when we had some large activities by Human Practice, we would put the progress of the activities on the internet and add some feelings about these activities. Every time, our messages               have been viewed by thousands of people and many classmates admired us and left their comments.
On Twitter , we saw many iGEM teams. From their photos, we saw that we were the same in the progress of discovering. We all had failures and successes, which made us sad and joyful. Anyway, like the peers from different places of the whole               world, we will try hard and be brave with enthusiasm. Whoever, whatever, we fight for the same dream!
