An Interview about Dermatophytosis in Peking University Shenzhen Hospital
On March 24th, 2017, we interviewed a doctor(a dermatologist of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital) to conduct a survey about ringworm (dermatophytosis).
Firstly,the doctor informed us of the characteristics of dermatophytosis: 1. Ringworm tend to grow in moist and sweaty environment. 2. People with low immunity are more susceptible to ringworm. 3.The main route of transmission is physical contact.
Secondly, the doctor told us about the importance of precaution, People should strengthen their own immune system and improve their living environment. As for treatment, different types of ringworm have different therapies respectively. People usually choose topical agents and oral medicine to treat dermatophytosis. However, present treatments require such a long-term process that most patients can’t adhere to the medication. In addition, drug resistance is now a serious problem. We also obtained the information about public issues. For example, most patients don’t attach importance to ringworm,and most of them discontinue their treatments as soon as the medicine have made certain effect,which may reduce the effectiveness of the medicine.
In the end, the doctor told us that most of the present researches on the therapy of ringworm are the development of medicine for deep infection of ringworm (deep dermatophytosis).
With the professional help of the doctor, we realized that the public awareness of ringworm is unbelievably low and many misunderstandings still exist. Therefore, we were eager to arouse the public awareness of ringworm so that people can get better treatment.
