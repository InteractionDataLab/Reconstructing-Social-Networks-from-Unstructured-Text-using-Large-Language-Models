Fundraising
Due to lack of enough funds to complete our experiments, on Oct 16th, 2017 ,we started fundraising on the website: https://www.qschou.com/. In the website, we introduced iGEM and synthetic biology. We also made a self-introduction to the public. Besides, we described some parts of our project and showed some pictures of our team members. We are very grateful to the people who have supported us and also appreciate the sponsors for their support.
