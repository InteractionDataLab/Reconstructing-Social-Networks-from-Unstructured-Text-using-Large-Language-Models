Overview
Our team is made up of 20 memebers including the two that had   been retired. We are assigned to different kinds of work according to   our interests and merits and each of us makes special contributions to   our team.
Mixiao Gui , the leader of Shenzhen_SFLS team, is responsible for   managing the team and instructing team members to design and implement   the project. She is also in charge of contacting with professors and   seniors for us, finding labs and supervising the progress   of all the project.
Suxuan Wang, the vice leader of Shenzhen_SFLS team, is responsible   for managing the team and holding the public activity and   investigation.
Our team
Our team is divided into four groups :  the theoretical   experimental group, the social research group, the modeling group and   the website design group.
The Theoretical Experimental Group
This group includes :
Mixiao Gui， Yuheng Dai ，Yiting Xiang ，Yue Chen ,   Runqi Zhu ，Yingxuan Tan， Shuanghua Lai ，Lan Shen， Yuhao Wan and   Jing Feng(retired).
These members are responsible for constructing the project   theory and the experiments.
The Social Research Group
This group includes :
Suxuan Wang, Jingtong Huang, Qinni Zhang, Ziqi Zheng，   Xuelan Li, Fang Li and Yaduo Zhang (retired).
This group is responsible for the Human Practice with   publicity, pulling sponsorship and so on. It is this group that   presents us in front of the public!
Logo and Website Design
Zisang Yang is in charge of all the tasks of designing of   the whole team.  She did a lot of designing work including logo, PPT   templates, badge and uniforms.
She also decorated our wiki, making our wiki more vivid and   funny.  She not only makes our program better presented in front of   the public, but also better informs the public with sythetic biology's knowledge.
Modeling
Our modeling jobs are all in the charge of Xiaoyi Wang.
And in the early time, she also helped with the theoretical experimental group.
Wiki
Everyone in our team take part in the construction of our wiki. We aim to show more detailed information of our project, our team and our school. We also drew many drafts and came up with many beautiful ideas in order to create a lovely wiki for the team.
Training and Guidance
Professor Yaoting Gui, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Shenzhen PKU-HKUST Medical Center, instructed us to build our theory system and offered support to our experiment.

Acknowledgments
Primer synthesis and sequencing service are provided by Sangon   Biotech and DNA products are provided by   Beijing Syngentech Co.,LTD.
As a high school team, our knowledge and ability in all aspects   are not enough, so our project can not be done without everyone's   support and cooperation. We are very excited to work with the   graduates and our instructor from the lab and get their support!   Thanks for them!
We genuinely appreciate Haoqian Zhang and Boxiang Wang's help   with our theory and experiment, Xiaoqiang Guo's help of our   experiment, Hongmin Zhang (the instructor of SUSTech_Shenzhen ),   Boxiang Cheng (a doctor in Peking University oncology department   Shenzhen Hospital) and Jinfen Zheng's (a doctor in dermatological   department Luohu District Chronic Disease Prevention and Treatment   Hospital) suggestions for our project.
Project support and advice
Haoqian Zhang，a professor from CAS, facilitated us building our theory system and offered advice to our human practise work.
Dr. Zheng, a doctor from dermatological department in the Hospital of Chronic Disease Prevention and Treatment in Luohu district in Shenzhen ,we interviewed her on some basic information about Ringworm and cancers.
Dr. Cheng, a doctor from Peking Shenzhen University Hospital, attended our interview on various aspects including treatment of Melanoma and prospect of Crispr.
Claudia C.Agnew,a physician assistant, clarified us with the current situation and prospect of gene therapy and melanoma.
Venue support
On 29th July, we borrowed our lecture venue from Book City, and three members of our team gave speeches for the public.
Fundraising help
NOVA, gave us financial support.
Hairui Li, provided us with financial support and contribute to the publishing of our picture book.
