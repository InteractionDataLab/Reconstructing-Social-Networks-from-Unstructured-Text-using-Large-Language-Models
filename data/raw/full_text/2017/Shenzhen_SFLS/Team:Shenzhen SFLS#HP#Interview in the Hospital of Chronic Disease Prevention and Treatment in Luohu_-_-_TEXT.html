Interview in the Hospital of Chronic Disease Prevention and Treatment in Luohu
We interviewed Jinfen Zhen, a dermatologist of the Hospital of Chronic Disease Prevention and Treatment in Luohu. We asked her a few questions about melanoma and trichophyton to compare these two diseases and choose a more meaningful one.
From the interview, we learned that the melanoma is a rapidly spreading cancer and the main treatment for melanoma is surgery, but it could not be applied to the patients who have missed the best operation time. On the contrary, the diseases that caused by Trichophyton rubrum are easier to cure.
To sum up, the melanoma needs more public attentions. We want to improve the treatment of melanoma and allow more people to be treated successfully.
