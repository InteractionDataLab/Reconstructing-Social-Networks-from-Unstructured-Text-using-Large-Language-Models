Biosafety Level of Laboratory
Introduction of our biosafety video
In order to enhance the communication between iGEM teams and improve the project, we and SCIE-SIAT co-sponsored a meet-up. We invited eight iGEM teams to join the meet-up in Shenzhen College of International Education. Professor Haoqian Zhang               from Chinese Academy of Science was invited to join this meet-up as well. Each team had a 15-minute presentation. Before the presentation, Professor Zhang explained the evaluation criteria for iGEM competition in detail and offered many               valuable suggestions toward each team. After the exhibition of project, each team had a 10-minute question time. It was benefit for each team to understand the projects of others. At the same time, it gave a chance for us to offer or obtain               suggestions from others.
