iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting
To promote respective projects and have a throughout discussion with other iGEM teams, six undergraduate teams and two high school teams attended the meet-up organized by Shenzhen University (SZU). We gathered at Shenzhen University and had a wonderful meeting on April 29th, 2017.
Firstly, the eight teams joined the meet-up described the backgrounds and core theories of their project. We learned more information about the projects of other teams and had a further understanding about synthetic biology.
After presentations of their projects, the participants raised questions and gave out suggestions on others’ projects. Here, we got an important experimental hypothesis linking Human Beta Defensin 3 (HBD3) to motor protein so that HBD3 can not be transported outside the bacteria.
We got many inspirations, especially the ones about the side-effect and safety issues for our project.After the meet-up,we improved our design and learned more detailed information about our experiments.
