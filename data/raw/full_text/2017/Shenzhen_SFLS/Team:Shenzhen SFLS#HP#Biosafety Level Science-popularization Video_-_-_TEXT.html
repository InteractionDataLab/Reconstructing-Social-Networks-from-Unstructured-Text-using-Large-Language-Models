Biosafety Level Science-popularization Video
We took zhanghaoqian’s advice that we could make a video systematically introducing laboratory biosafety levels.
Having looked for lots of materials on the Internet,we arranged these in a clear way for the public to easily get along with it and we made a script based on these materials. At the same time we cooperated with Beijing Genomics Institute to               edit and trim it.
Having finished the video in late October, we uploaded it onto several video websites. For websites in China we chose three of the most influential ones including Bilibili, Youku and iQiyi. Also, to reach the goal of providing systematic and               concise information for people around the world, we also uploaded our video onto Youtube.
