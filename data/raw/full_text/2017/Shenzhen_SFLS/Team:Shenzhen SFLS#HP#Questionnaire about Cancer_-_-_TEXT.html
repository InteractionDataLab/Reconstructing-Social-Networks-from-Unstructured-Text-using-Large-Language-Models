Questionnaire about Cancer
Summary
Question 1
Question 2
Question 3
Question 6, 7, 8
Conclusion
After consulting with some experts and getting their opinion on our former projects, we decided to shift the focus of our project from Trichophyton rubrum to cancer（the leading cause of human death）. In order to learn more about the significance               of this issue, we designed a questionnaire including 10 questions related to the public.
We selected some questions, the results of survey as follows. We also explained how these results helped us determine the direction of our project.
Question 1: What types of cancers are you most familiar with?
Result: The public had less understanding of skin cancer than any other cancers
Question 2: Which of the following symptoms is the symptom of cancer and is necessary to go to hospital for examination?
Result: Only about one quarter of the people chose the right answer. Most of them couldt tell symptoms of the cancer. ( The correct answer is shown in Red: The local skin is ruptured, bleeding and pigmented nevus itching ).
Question 3: Which of the following treatments do you trust most?
Result: Most of people chose surgery.
Question 6, 7, 8: Which of the following symptoms are not the symptoms of liver cancer, breast cancer or skin cancer?
Result: We found that 68.33 % people can answer the questions about liver cancer correctly, 35.36 % people can correctly answer the questions about breast cancer, 25.38 % people can correctly answer the questions about skin cancer. (Answer to Question 6 - Chills; answer to Question 7 - Distending pain of mammary pain; answer to Question 8: Papule.)
Conclusion
In summary, these results revealed that the public misconceptions of skin cancer were the most common. Because of the less attention for skin cancer, people tend to ignore the symptoms and delay treatment. However, missing the best time for             treatment, patients may suffer more from the skin cancer. In a word，It is necessary to raise public awareness of skin cancer.
