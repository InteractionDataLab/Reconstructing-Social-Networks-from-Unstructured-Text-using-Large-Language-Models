Aid Education in Bali Island
From July 24th 2017 to July 30th 2017, our team member went to Sd Three Bukin school in Bali Island . We found many kids in the school had skin disease such as flat wart, chickenpox, hives, prickly heat, sweat herpes and so on. In addition, we found that students were not familiar with the precautions of these diseases, so we introduced some easy ways of preventing kids from skin diseases. It included:
Wash your hands before meals and after going to the toilet. Do not drink  unboiled water. Do not eat cold and raw food.Dry yourself as soon as possible after sweating. Clean up immediately after you touch the dirty water in the rainy day.
Keep away from eating some excitant foods, like onions, gingers, garlics, strong tea, coffee, liquors and other foods which may cause allergy easily.
Keep away from bushes and forests. Protect yourself from bitten by poisonous insects during outdoor activity.
If you have some pruritus feelings, do not scratch it.
Get up early and go to bed early to make sure that you have enough sleep time. Do some exercise to keep healthy.
