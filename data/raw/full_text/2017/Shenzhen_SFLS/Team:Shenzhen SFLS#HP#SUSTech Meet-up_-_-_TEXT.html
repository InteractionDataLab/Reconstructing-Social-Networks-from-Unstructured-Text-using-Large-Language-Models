SUSTech_China Meet-up
On July 10, we joined in a meet up held by Southern University of Science and Technology.
Since we’re high school team, and the condition of our project at the time is kind of complex, a number of problems need to be settled urgently. We got the chance to have a talk with their advisor, Dr Hongmin Zhang. Through the process we mainly express exact problems that appeared in the experiments and discussed the feasibility of our assumption both with the professor and their team members. In this part of our conversation, as we still had to make a choice between our two available projects, Dr. Zhang helped us a lot on analyzing the disadvantages of experimenting on Trichophyton rubrum. This is a crucial turning point to our final decision and we appreciated a lot.
What deserves to be mentioned is that, as experienced competitors, they initiatively helped us reckon our rest of time and offered a schedule available for reference.
Our 2 teams then met in a hall and separately made simple presentations to introduce our projects. We learnt a lot especially in how a professional research team runs and how we should efficiently organize such a team and do management.
We then visited their laboratory in passing with a student introduced us some advanced device. They also offered us varieties of material we urgently need which is really a big help.
To sum up, SUSTech_Shenzhen team’s suggestions led us to clearly consider the direction of our project and this meet-up strengthen our great relationship each other.
