CRISPR Questionnaire
We conducted a survey to investigate common public misconceptions about CRISPR.
Question 3: What is CRISPR?
Result: Through this survey, we found the public knew the application of CRISPR. It maybe caused by the popularization of CRISPR application through mass media. 48.8% of the participants considered CRISPR a kind of immune system. ( Answer for Question 3 - It is a kind of immune system. )
However, people had no idea about the origin of CRISPR
Question 4: What is the origin of CRISPR?
Result: According to the data above, we found that only about half of the participants knew that CRISPR originated from germs.( Answer for Question 4 - It comes from germs )
We also raised questions about ethical issues of CRISPR to investigate the attitudes towards CRISPR of the public.
Question 5: What do you think about the treatment of using CRISPR?
Result: More than 90% of the people thought it had broad prospects.
Question 6: Whether CRISPR could be used in the issues of human’s gene?
Result:About 78.85% of the participants considered CRISPR could be used in treatment of human,which indicated that most of people believed CRISPR could benefit human beings. However, there were still a minority of people doubt about the potential ethical issues and the future development of CRISPR.
In conclusion, the public’s attitude towards CRISPR is optimistic.They believed that  CRISPR technology has a great prospect in the future.

On October 25, BGIC-Unoin and our team conducted an activity at Class3 Grade 6, Donghai Primary School Attached to Shenzhen Foreign Languages School.
We started the activity with a series of quiz .
Then we told them some stories about the history of biology research and introduced them some basic knowledge of DNA. After that we played a DNA base-paring game with the children, leading them to learn more about biology.
Before ending the class, we gave out the same questionnaire to the children again and investigated the influence our activity exerted on them
Our statistics showed that our biology class seemed pretty successful.
Statistics before the speech
Statistics after the speech
On 27th Oct 2017, BGIC-Unoin and our team went to Shenzhen Baihe Foreign Language School to give a speech about our project. The content of the speech included iGEM introduction, cancer introduction, gene therapy and CRISPR/Cas 9 system.
After the speech, we conducted a survey about CRISPR. From the statistics we can know that after our presentation students have a clearer understanding of the related information about CRISPR, our speech focus.
