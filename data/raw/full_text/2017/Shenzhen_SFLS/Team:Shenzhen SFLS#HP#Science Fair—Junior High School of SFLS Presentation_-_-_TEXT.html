Science Fair & Junior High School of SFLS Presentation
In order to popularize synthetic biology and the project of our iGEM team, we joined in the Scientific Festival in Shenzhen Foreign Languages School and gave a presentation for all the students on April 20, 2017. Scientific Festival was an               integrated survey of scientific and technological education achievements, as well as a stage for students to exhibit their talents on science.
We introduced iGEM competition, synthetic biology and its application, and other biological technologies to the senior high school students. The speaker used the words easy to understand and an interesting video to capture audiences’ attentions               deeply.
Meanwhile, we also gave a lecture for junior high school students. On June 5, 2017, we held a presentation at junior high school of Shenzhen Foreign Languages School.
