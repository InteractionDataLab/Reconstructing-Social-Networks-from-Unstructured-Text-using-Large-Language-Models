Passaging adherent cells      DETAILS
Remove culture medium from the dish. Gently add 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the dish, and shake it several times.
Remove PBS from the dish. Add 1 ml of pre-warmed 0.1% Trypsin to the dish. Gently shake it to get complete coverage of the cell layer. Incubate the cells at room temperature for 40-60 seconds. (Note: The actual incubation time varies with                   the cell line used.)
Add 2ml of pre-warmed complete growth medium (DMEM with 10% FBS). Disperse the cells by pipetting over the cell layer surface several times.
Transfer the cells to 15 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 1200 ×g for 3 minutes.
Resuspend the cell pellet in 1-2 ml of pre-warmed medium and take 10 μl of medium for cell counting.
Cells were seeded in plates at the recommended density, and pipe the rest of the cells into new cell culture dishes, and put dishes back to the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2).

Mix the plasmids and transfection reagent and wait for 20 minutes.
Take out the seeded the cells in 6-well plates from incubator. (Note: The number of cells is generally suitable at 70-80% confluence.) Remove the original complete growth medium (DMEM with 10% FBS), and then add 1.6 ml of the mixture of                   the plasmid, transfection reagent and serum free medium to each well.
Put the plates back into the incubator.
Transwell migration assay      DETAILS
Remove culture medium from the dish. Gently add 1-2 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to the dish, and shake it several times.

Remove the medium from the small chamber with cotton balls (or remove it with a pipette, avoid destroying the film).
Take out the small chambers and remove the medium in the wells. Add 500 µl of PFA (multi chlorine formaldehyde) into the wells, and then put the small chambers back and let it sit for 30 minutes.
Take out the small chambers, remove the residual PFA in the wells by cotton swabs and add 500 µl of PBS to each well.
Add 500 µl of crystal violet dye to the wells and put back the small chambers (avoid making any bubbles). Stand it for 20 min for dyeing.

Centrifuge the cell suspension at 1200×g for 3 minutes. Aseptically decant supernatant without disturbing the cell pellets.
Resuspend the cell pellet in cold freezing medium.
Dispense aliquots of the cells into cryovials. Place the cryovials in an isopropanol chamber in order to decrease the temperature gradually and store them at -80℃ overnight.
Transfer frozen cells to liquid nitrogen, and store them in the gas phase above the liquid nitrogen.
Cell resuscitation      DETAILS
Remove the cryovial containing the frozen cells from liquid nitrogen storage and immediately place it into a 37°C water bath.
Quickly thaw the cells (< 1 minute) by gently swirling the vial in the 37°C water bath until there is just a small bit of ice left in the vial.
Before opening the vial, wipe the outside of the vial with 70% ethanol.
Transfer the cells into a centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 1200×g for 3 minutes.
Aseptically decant the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.
Gently resuspend the cells in complete growth medium, and transfer them into the culture vessel and then culture in the incubator.
Flow cytometry assay for apoptosis      DETAILS
Centrifuge the cell suspension at 500×g for 5 minutes.
Determine the total number of cells and percent of viability by the automated cell counter. (If necessary, add growth medium to the cells to achieve the desired cell concentration and recount the cells.) Then collected 2×105~2×106 cells for assay.
Add pre-warmed PBS to the cells, centrifuge at 500×g for 5 minutes and then collect the cells.
