Public Speech in Shenzhen Book City
Shenzhen Book City is located in downtown and has a large number of customers.
On July 29th, 2017, we introduced iGEM and our project to citizens in the Book City, and a large number of people participated in the event.
Three members of our team delivered speeches on different topics, including introduction of iGEM, synthetic biology, science popularization of cancer and our project - Melanoma. In the end, we made a simple pop quiz about our speech.
Through these speeches, more people got to know the  related information about melanoma and our project.
