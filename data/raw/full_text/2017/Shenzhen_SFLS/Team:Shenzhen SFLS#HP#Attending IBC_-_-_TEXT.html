Attending IBC
XIX International Botanical Congress was held in Shenzhen China. This summer, we joined in IBC and learnt a lot from these international academic meetings. This congress cultivated our interest for plants and widened our horizon.
Professor Huanming Yang, as the leader of Beijing Genome Institute in Shenzhen (BGI-Shenzhen), held a wonderful speech, which encouraged us to fight with the main problem in Biology - ethics, and led us in a bright world filled with plants. Before his speech, we introduced our project of cancer toward him and obtained his affirmation. During the speech, he introduced the importance of plants, DNA, the great genetic project —The Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), which let us learn a lot. Also, we learnt a lot from the speeches of Professors Douglas Soltis and Pamela Soltis from the University of Florida, USA, and Professor Jian-Kang ZHU from Chinese Academy of Science.
According to IBC, we obtained meaningful and invaluable knowledge about plants. Also, attending this congress, we strengthen the determination of our project.
