Title
Contribute 1: Experiment for sacB Promoter Test
1. Experimental Report
1.1.The sacB gene and sacB promoter
The sacB gene usually extracted from bacillus subtilis encodes the secreted enzyme levansucrase (sucrose: 2,6-b-D-fructan 6-b-D-fructosyltransferase). The enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of sucrose and synthesis of levans, which are high-molecular-weight fructose polymers. In E. coli, levansucrase activity is mostly located in the periplasm. The molecular basis of the toxicity is still unclear, but the toxicity could be due to an accumulation of levans which might encumber the periplasm because of their high molecular weight or a transfer of fructose residues to inappropriate acceptor molecules, which could thereafter have toxic effects on the bacterial cells. In our project, we make use of the sacB gene to kill the rest of E.coli that don’t play an effective role in coccid on leaves and scatter into the surroundings.
The sacB gene has been used in iGEM, but we didn’t find much description of sacB gene. Therefore, the efficiency of the promoter of sacB gene, which is a constitutive promoter, is uncleared. This experiment tests the efficiency of the promoter of sacB gene. We designed a plasmid with the promoter of sacB, ribosome binding side J61100, GFP and terminator B0015 on the backbone pSB1c3.

1.2. Vector Construction
We sent the plasmid to the Genscript company and had it man-made synthesized. To make a measurement next, we get a standard promoter BBa_J23100 into the identical plasmid backbone.

1.3. sacB Promoter Measurement
1.3.1 Abstract
In order to measure the strength of sacB promoter, standard measurement approaches for characterizing the sacB promoter were used so that it will be easier to be re-used by future teams.
We choose BBa_J23100(figure 4) from the Relative Promoter Units (RPUs) as the comparison to the sacB promoter. Three groups were set including an expertimental group(transformed with the sample), a positive control group(transformed with the standard J23100) and a blank controller. In each experiment there were also two parallel tests. After linking up the standard promoter BBa_J23100 into the identical plasmid backbone, we attained the OD600 to estimate the concentration of bacteria suspension with our linear function of detecting concentration of bacteria suspension in experiment 1. With the data of OD600,we controlled the bacteria in logarithmic phase. Then we made a measurement of the fluorescene of each groups.Using the fluorescein fluorescence standard curve made by A1~12 in 96 well plates and three groups of fluorescein intensity data,fluorescenece concentration was  computed and histogram of two promoters was made to figure out the intensity difference from fluorescenece concentration.
1.3.2 Method summary and experimental data
1.3.2.1 Measurement of OD600
Using the spectrophotometer  to get the estimated value of optical density of the 3groups, we made a conversion to the concentration of the bacterial suspension as an alternative independent variable of the expression intensity with the linear function of detecting concentration of bacteria suspension in experiment 1Y(Figure 5). Table 1 shows the Bacterial suspension Concentration[(CFU)/g] converted from the optical density[Abs].
1.3.2.2  Fluorescent Measurement
On the basis of data of OD600, we prepared the set-up of the ELISSA and calibration of fluorescence with each of the triplicates of the 6 groups, which was measured for its tripartite fluorescein. We also designed a set of precise concentration gradient to map the fluorescein fluorescence standard curve, after which the fitting function curve was attained.
For triplicates in each parallel group, the geometric mean of fluorescein [ABS] was calculated, and after all the geometric mean of each of the two parallel groups were attained. According to the arithmetic in terms of units, we divided it by the OD600 also averaged from each of the parallel groups.
To detecting inaccuracy in our measurement, we also saved the original database and use the corresponding data of OD600 to make enumeration in the same arithmetic, with which we have error bar in our contrastive histogram of the sacB promoter and BBa_J23100. Table 2 shows the original data attained from plate reader and the computation in terms of per unit in CFU. Table 3 shows the final result of the difference in the expressive quantity of GFP in these two promoters.

1.3.2.3 Discussion
Using our original data, we made an analysis of the significant difference between the sacB promoter and the positive control BBa_J23100. It turned out that the P value of the data of the three groups each in pairs is far less than 0.05. We drew a conclusion that the data differs significantly. As a result, the promoter intensity of J23100>the sacB promoter and the expression of the sacB promoter in our engineering E.coli has reached an experimental verification.
