The sequences of both chitinase and protease were cloned from a entomogenous fungus called verticillium lecanii. Testing the efficiency and the effects of these enzymes’ expression is a fundamental portion of the whole project. We hypothesized that the enzyme activity (defined by active unit divided by bacteria population) is positively related to a given period of time. We obtained factors from bacteria density in culture to the degradation amount of substrate via visible spectrophotometer.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sec2"><DIV id="page"><H1>II Background</H1><P style="font-size:18px">	Seq 1: K2224001</P><P style="font-size:18px">Promoter+RBS+Lecanicillium lecanii strain 432 endochitinase (chit1)+Terminator</P><P style="font-size:18px">	Seq 2: K2224002</P><P style="font-size:18px">Promoter+RBS+Lecanicillium lecanii strain CA-12 cuticle-degrading proteinase (Pr1)+Terminator</P><H2>	Enzyme Activity Definition:</H2><P style="font-size:18px">The enzyme activity is defined by the amount of N- acetyl glucosamine that produced by Chitinase' s hydrolysis to chitin divided by the number of cells (or bacteria concentration). Since the product, N- acetyl glucosamine, can lead to light absorbtion peak at 585nm and the light absorption can be detected by Spectrophotometer, we can figure out the relative activity of enzyme DQ412944.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sec1"><DIV id="page"><H1>III Objective</H1><P style="font-size:18px">Considered all the properties of E. coli expression system, there are serval things that can influence the expression of a particular enzyme. To understand and categorize the factors, the expression process of enzyme (protein, specifically) need to be broke down into three stages, which are target plasmid replication, transcription and translation (include further process to structure protein). Among these stages, transcription and translation affects the expression efficiency mainly.</P><P style="font-size:18px">In this experiment, the influence to chitinase and protease expression in TOP10 expression system is mainly measured in two factors, which is bacteria population and enzyme activity. To be specific, bacteria population determines the size of bacteria population that is capable for enzyme expression. Enzyme activity is the ability or effectiveness of catalyzing reactions.</P><P style="font-size:18px">Considered that the condition in natural environment will be much more complicate and unpredictable, designing appropriate experiments and dividing factors correctly are especially vital.</P><P style="font-size:18px">More importantly, our experiment is constructed by learning previous paper carrying out resemble experiments. According to our studies, previous experiments mainly focused on characterizing the enzyme (Chitinase and Protease), so the researchers expressed the gene (in mainly two different ways, culture the verticillium lecanii then extract the enzymes, and modified the sequences and express it in E. coli expression systems) and tested the enzyme activity in different temperature and different pH. One study tested the enzyme activity to figure out the enzymic mechanism that helped verticillium lecanii invade host coccid. Our experiment aims to explore the possibility in developing this mechanism into a product. Therefore, we designed our experiments by relating the enzyme activity to culturing time, which enables us to acquire the optimum culturing time when using the product.</P><P style="font-size:18px">According to the bibliographical material, the re-expression of chitinase is completed in JM109 (a type of E. coli strain) expression system with plasmid backbone pMD18-T. The re-expression of protease is completed in BL21(DE3) with plasmid backbone pMD18-T. Both of the template experiment in the material use Amp as an antibiotic. In our experiment, we take TOP10 as the expression system, using standardized iGEM plasmid backbone pSB1C3 and Chl as antibiotic.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sec2"><DIV id="page"><H1>IV Hypothesis</H1><P style="font-size:18px">According to the analysis above, we predict that the enzyme activity is positively related to time within a period.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sec1"><DIV id="page"><H1>V Procedure</H1><H3>1.

We can define this relationship as a linear relationship but since it is weak and uncertain, further research and experiment should be taken, until a confirmation can be done.</P><P style="font-size:18px">Unfortunately, the expected protease activity measurement is not successfully done since the measurement kit is invalid by inappropriate preservation operation.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="sec2"><DIV id="page"><H1> Reference</H1><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/File:Chitinase_activity_measurement_kit.pdf">Chitinase activity measurement_kit</A></P><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/File:A_research_for_Chitinase_in_Verticillium_lecanii.pdf">A research for Chitinase in Verticillium_lecanii.pdf</A></P><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/File:A_simple_method_to_test_the_concentration_of_bacteria_fluid.pdf">A simple method to test the concentration of bacteria fluid.pdf</A></P><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://http://parts.igem.org/File:Esterase_consortium_Process_Biochem_2016_%EF%BC%88marked.pdf">Esterase consortium Process Biochem 2016</A></P><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/File:The_function_of_protease_and_chitinase_in_the_process_of_Verticillium_lecanii_invasion.pdf">The function of protease and chitinase in the process of Verticillium_lecanii invasion</A></P><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/File:Chitinase_activity_measurement_kit.pdf">Chitinase_activity_measurement_kit</A></P><P style="font-size:18px"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/File:Lab_opertaion_recording.docx">iGEM Lab_opertaion_recording for activity measurement</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
