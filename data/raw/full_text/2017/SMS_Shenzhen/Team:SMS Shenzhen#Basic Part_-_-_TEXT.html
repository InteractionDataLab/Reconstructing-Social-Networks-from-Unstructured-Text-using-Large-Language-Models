BBa_K2224006
This is the coding sequence of a chitinase, which is from the Lecanicillium lecanii strain 432. The Lecanicillium lecanii uses this chitinase to degrade the shell of scale insect. In SMS_Shenzhen_2017 project, this chintinase functions as a core mechanism to degrade the chitin-protein complex, which makes up the second layer of the shell of scale insect.
BBa_K2224007
This part is a proteinase, which is from the Lecanicillium lecanii strain CA-12. The Lecanicillium lecanii uses this proteinase to degrade the protein-chitin shell of scale insect. This part can be transformed into E.coli to express proteinase, which shows a strong ability in degrading the protein layer under the Scanning Electron Microscope. In SMS_Shenzhen 2017 project, this proteinase functions as a core mechanism to degrade the chitin-protein complex,in which the protein wraps up the chitin to form the hard layer.
BBa_K2224008
SacB promoter is the beginning sequence of SacB gene.
