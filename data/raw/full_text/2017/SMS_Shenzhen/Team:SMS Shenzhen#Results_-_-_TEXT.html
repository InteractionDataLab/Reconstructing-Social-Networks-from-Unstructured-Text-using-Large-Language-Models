3. Result of Electron Microscope Observation of Erosion of Scale Insectâ€™s Shell after Introducing Protease
Result Picture 1 - Experimental Group
Result Picture 2 - Control Group (without protease)
The shell soaked in protease appears to be very different from that in the control group.
In control group, structure was relatively complete and the characteristics were clear, but the insect body of the experimental group had lost its structural characteristics under the action of protease, and the outer shell was severely eroded.
Result Picture 3 - Experimental Group
Result Picture 4 - Control Group (without protease)
The sample in the experimental group (arrow marker) has obvious erosion marks compared to the control group, which is relatively complete and flat.
