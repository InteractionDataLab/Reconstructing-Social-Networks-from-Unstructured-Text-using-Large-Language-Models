BBa_K2224001
This composite part contains a coding sequence of chitinase, which is from the Lecanicillium lecanii strain 432. The Lecanicillium lecanii uses this chitinase to degrade the shell of scale insect. This part can be transformed into E.coli to express chitinase, which shows a strong ability in degrading chintin into N-acetylglucosamine. In SMS_Shenzhen_2017 project, this chintinase functions as a core mechanism to degrade the chitin-protein complex, which makes up the second layer of the shell of scale insect.
BBa_K2224002
This composite part contains a coding sequence of proteinase , which is from the Lecanicillium lecanii strain CA-12. The Lecanicillium lecanii uses this proteinase to degrade the protein-chitin shell of scale insect. This part can be transformed into E.coli to express proteinase, which shows a strong ability in degrading the protein layer under the Scanning Electron Microscope. In SMS_Shenzhen 2017 project, this proteinase functions as a core mechanism to degrade the chitin-protein complex,in which the protein wraps up the chitin to form the hard layer.
BBa_K2224003
SacB promoter is the starting sequence of SacB gene.
BBa_K2224004
This part is the combination of SacB promoter and SRRz self cleaving gene.
BBa_K2224005
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 SacB Promotor+RBS+GFP+Terminater This is the standard measurement part of promoter of SacB gene. In our experiment, SacB promoter shows a strong ability in E.coli expression system, contrary to the former belief that this promoter is weak in E.coli.
