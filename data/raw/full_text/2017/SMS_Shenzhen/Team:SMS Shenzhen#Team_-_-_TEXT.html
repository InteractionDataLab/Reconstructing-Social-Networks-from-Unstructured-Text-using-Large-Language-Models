Jin Huang
Student Leader
Hi, I am Jin Huang, a senior in Shenzhen Middle School. I love solving real world problems and look synthetic biology as a useful tool, so I participate in iGEM throughout high school years and I am the team leader this year. Enjoying our Pesticide Mate project this year, I hope to make farming more sustainable in the future.
Yuqiao Li
Student Leader
Hi, I am Yuqiao Li, and I’m one of the student leaders this year. Synthetic biology inspires me to explore further in science, and it enables me to understand this world to a better extent. I wish our Pesticide Mate will be beneficial to farmers and bring them a better life as well.
Zhian Li
Student Member
My name is Zhian Li, the head of Wiki group. I participated in the Human Practice and the construction of our Wiki since I have some skills in HTML5 and CSS. I will major in Environmental Science in college. I believe that our project will promote the declination in the use of pesticide and lead to a better environment.
Shuoyi Li
Student Member
Hi, I am Shuoyi Li, a senior from Shenzhen Middle School. I enjoy the process of using theories and experimental results to prove hypotheses. I participate in iGEM this year to continue my interest in biology and deepen my understanding in synthetic biology. Learning from the design of the Part for our project, I hope to explore synthetic biology and gene editing technology at university.
Wanting Liu
Student Member
Hello, I’m Wanting Liu from Shenzhen middle school. I'm interested in genetic engineering and I'm delighted to take part in this competition.
Xiaoyang Qiao
Student Member
Hi, my name is Xiaoyang Qiao, a senior student in Shenzhen Middle School. I got a great interest in nature since my childhood, which actually result in my exploration in biology later on. With that interest, I joined our SMS_Shenzhen team and hoped that we could do something to preserve every small beauty in our environment. I am responsible for the market analysis and applied design.
Shutong Gu
Student Member
Hi, I’m Shutong Gu from Shenzhen middle school, China. I’m the designer of our project and I take responsible to the experiment. Attracted by amazing glamour of nature, I have developed great interest in plants. I have turned my little balcony to the kingdom of Sodium and other amazing plants since I was 10 years old. As scale insects that are strongly relate to our project are the main pests in my little garden, I am excited in our project and it’s my great pleasure to devote my effort in this competition.

Student Member
My name is Cheng Fangzhou and I’m a senior 2 student. My main role in this team is to perform experiments and to write a part of Notebook of our team wiki. I sometimes do some odd jobs like purchasing postcards for our team. I’m taking the AP Biology course and really wish to major in medicine in the future. I love listening to occident pop music and formulating travel plans, although the plans seldom come true.
Yu Ji
Student Member
This is Yu Ji, Elroy, from Shenzhen middle school. I take the responsibility of writing and experiment in the team. Biology and chemistry are the fields that I interested in. I really enjoying in figuring out how organism act and how molecules react with others. I had a really pleasant experience in IGEM process. To me, it is not a competition, but a meaningful process to enjoy what I like from the true heart.
Shiyuan Wen
Student Member
Hi! I’m Shiyuan Wen from Shenzhen Middle School. I’m really glad to be a member in SMS iGEM team. I am interested in biology, because the charismatic nature has lots of secretes of life. iGEM provides a valuable opportunity for me to explore life.
Sun Leyang
Student Member
I'm a member of experiment group and HP group. During the research and preparation, I did the testing experiment with all my groupmates, took part in making our Wiki, designed charts and then did modeling. Though sometimes hard, what iGEM has infused me with was the enthusiasm and persevere all the way. Thanks to iGEM, “stay hungry, stay foolish” to me wasn't just a slogan any longer.
