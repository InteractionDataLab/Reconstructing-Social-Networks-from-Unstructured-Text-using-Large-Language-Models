Our team consisted of one biologist, two biochemists, one natural scientist, one computer scientist, two mathematicians and three physicists.  Therefore our interdisciplinary team combines the different knowledge and skill sets of our members. We had a week of 'bootcamp' training in the Easter holidays where individuals were taught the basics of lab work and concepts we could employ in our project. Our project idea was decided during within the first few weeks of July after a lot of brainstorming and discussions with academics. The project lab work started following the completion of the interlab study in July. Unless otherwise stated, all the content documented on our Wiki was done by us.

Most Valuable Players (MVPs)
Dr Christian Hacker - Throughout the summer Christian took all the images our bacteria to provided us with microscopic evidence of our work.
Charlotte Gurr - Charlotte joined the team as our graphic designer. She designed all of the images for our wiki, presentation, graphics for the app, poster and the banner.
Dr Sarah Hartley – Introduced the concepts of RRI and assisted with the development of our human practices. Regularly meet with us to offer guidance and her expertise to help improve our approach to Human Practices.
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) - kindly provided us with all our DNA free of charge!
Technical Support
Dr Mark Hewlett - Help with dialysis and demonstrated simple biological protocols in boot camp week
Dr Joana Zaragoza-Castells - Helped with sample prep of the ICP-OES
Dr Chris Brunt-instructed use of SEM with XFAS
Angela Elliott - Helped with sample prep of the ICP-OES and ran the metal ion composition analysis
Katy Jones - Gave us data on metal ion and microbe species composition of the soils at Wheal Maid and put us in touch with Tomasa Sbaffi for Wheal Maid site sampling
Dr Ann Power - Helped prepare equipment to sample water, helped write protocols for on-site filtering and performing metal ion analysis on the water samples
Tomasa Sbaffi - Helped navigate the Wheal Maid site, choose the lagoons to be sampled and helped with sampling / sample filtration
Stakeholders
Veolia Treatment Plant - Provided us with vital information and invited us for a guided tour of the Treatment Plant at Wheal Jane where many of the questions we had were answered.
South West Water- Agreed to participate in an interview and gave us a tour around the plant. Provided information and answered questions surrounding the implementation of biosecurity.
Tauton Aquarium-Informed and advised us on the construction of different aspect of our filtration system.
Plymouth Marine Laboratory- provided suggestions and insight surrounding our applied design
Greenpeace-Kindly took the time to meet with two of our team members. Greenpeace provided us with additional research material and suggested ways we could make our project more appealing to other NGO'S.
