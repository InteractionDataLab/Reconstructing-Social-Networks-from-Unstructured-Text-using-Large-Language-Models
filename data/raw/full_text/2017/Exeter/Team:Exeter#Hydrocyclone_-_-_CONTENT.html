        through our <B> iterative design process </B>. </P><P>A hydrocyclone is a filter designed to separate larger particulates from a contaminated solution. Depending on
      size and shape, a hydrocyclone can be used to filter anything from sand (large particulates) to microalgae (small 
      particulates). The advantage of a hydrocyclone, and the reason that it is already widely used in industry, lies 
      with its relatively simple design structure, and its lack of moving parts. With no moving parts, a hydrocyclone 
      requires little maintenance and is seen as a cost effective, long term solution. For example, hydrocyclones are used in 
      the oil industry to separate oil from water and vice versa. They are also used in the drilling industry to separate sand 
      from the expensive clay that is used for lubrication during the drilling.</P><P>A hydrocyclone works by pumping contaminated water through an <B>inlet feed</B>, which is tangential to a 
     cylindrical feed chamber. A large vortex is then created inside the filter, which forces larger particulates to be 
     pushed out to the walls due to centrifugal forces. These larger particulates are then deposited through the 
     <B>spigot</B> at the bottom, while being carried in some waste solution. Meanwhile, a smaller, inner vortex is 
     generated through the centre of the hydrocyclone, which carries the lightest particles (the filtered water) up and 
     out of the <B>vortex finder</B> at the top. The filtered water is now mostly free of sediment and will not block 
     the second stage of filtration. </P><P> Hydrocyclones are essential to our project because we cannot afford to have our metal binding reactor blocked by
     unwanted debris in the contaminated waste that is being filtered. We have used an iterative design process to maximise 
     the separation efficiency (percentage of heavy sediment removed) of each hydrocyclone. Our final design boasts a 
     separation efficiency of 97.4%. </P><H2 id="Design1">Design 1</H2><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 1:</B> Hydrocyclone 1</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>For the 3D design of the hydrocyclones, we used the software package Autodesk Fusion 360. 
		We decided to use Autodesk Fusion 360, as it is free for students and is extremely intuitive 
		for beginners. The first design was influenced, quite simply, by 
                the shapes of other hydrocyclones seen on the internet. Unfortunately, the 3D printer printed 
		support structures on the interior of the first hydrocyclone, which were impossible to remove. 
                From this model, we did learn that the inlet was marginally too small for the piping and we were afraid of
		leakages, so we went away and made the design slightly larger in order to ensure a tight fit. 
		To prevent the support structures from affecting the interior of the cyclone, we split the design
		into four separate components which we glued together using Loctite Ultra Control Gel. We
		chose to use Loctite Ultra Control Gel following some brief research into the most effective 
		adhesives for PLA plastic. Ideally, we would have used a 3D printer that can print dissolvable,
		PVA support structures so we could have printed the hydrocyclone as a single piece.</P><P>After gluing together the hydrocyclone,
	we realised that to achieve the desired vortex we needed a more powerful pump than the peristaltic 
	pump we have in the labs. Our initial idea was to source a pond pump from an aquatics supplier, 
	however to achieve the desired 800ml/s (approximately), we would need a pump that would cost 
	somewhere in the region of £120. Unfortunately, this meant that the hydrocyclone was pretty much 
	useless. The only testing we were feasibly able to accomplish was running a tap through the cyclone 
	to explore whether the volume of underflow still vastly exceeded the volume of overflow. 
	Literature suggests that the ratio of overflow to underflow should be approximately 80:20 (Arterburn, R.A., 1982). 
	However, the overflow:underflow ratio was closer to 20:80 with this cyclone. Because of this 
	minor set back, we went back to the drawing board to work on Hydrocyclone 2. 
	</P><H2 id="Design2">Design 2</H2><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 2:</B> Hydrocyclone 2</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H4 id="DesignAdaptations">Design Adaptions</H4><P> A paper titled The Sizing and Selection of Hydrocyclones (Arterburn, R.A., 1982), 
	enabled us to design the hydrocyclone with much clearer direction. For example, we shortened 
	the cyclindrical feed chamber to promote the development of the inner cyclone. To futher promote 
	this development, we also extended the length of the vortex finder. In order to solve the flow 
	rate problem, we designed hydrocyclone 2 to be much smaller; the total volume is now 20cm<SUP>3</SUP>
	as opposed to the volume of hydrocyclone 1, which had a total volume of 100cm<SUP>3</SUP>.
        However, we still wanted this design to be able to separate slightly larger particulate contaminants 
	from water, such as sand, so we had to ensure that the inlet and outlets were large enough to prevent 
	clogging.
	</P><P>
	After the initial testing of Hydrocyclone 2 revealed an overflow:underflow volume ratio of 42:100
	(an improvement on Hydrocyclone 1, but still not sufficient), we returned to the literature,
	seeking instruction on how to adapt the design to increase overflow output.
	</P><H2 id="Design3">Design 3</H2><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 3:</B> Hydrocyclone 3</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>To increase overflow output, the paper titled: Hydrocyclones for Particle
	Size Separation (Cilliers, J.J., 2000) recommended increasing the angle of the conical chamber from the 
	cylindrical feed chamber from 20° to 30°. It also suggested that we change the diameter 
	of the vortex finder, as the diameter of the vortex finder should not equal the diameter of the spigot 
	(underflow outlet). It is suggested that the size of the spigot should be within the range 0.1D<SUB>c</SUB> - 0.2D<SUB>c</SUB>, 
        where D<SUB>c</SUB> is the diameter of the cylindrical feed chamber,
        while the size of the vortex finder should be within the range 0.13D<SUB>c</SUB> - 0.43D<SUB>c</SUB>. We also adapted the inlet
	feed so that it was rectangular as opposed to circular. In the image it looks square, however that opening
	tapers down to a rectangle with a height to width ratio of 2:1 (still tangential to the cylindrical feed 
	chamber).
	</P><P>Initial testing of the Hydrocyclone was to discover whether the perfect overflow to underflow ratio of
	80:20 could be achieved at a particular flow rate. After some initial optimisation of flow rates, we discovered 
	that the perfect ratio could be achieved with a flow rate of 143ml/s. The experiment we conducted was to connect
	the cyclone to a pump (a simple DC pump from an aquatics store, capable of 1200L/h), and run the experiment until the 
        overflow outlet had been filled to 1L. Our results then
	showed that at 143ml/s, for every litre of overflow, we had 250ml (±5ml) of underflow. The experiment
	was conducted three times and an average was taken. The next round of experimentation followed the protocol 
	as detailed below. We tested the hydrocyclone's ability to actually filter larger particulates from the 
	water.
