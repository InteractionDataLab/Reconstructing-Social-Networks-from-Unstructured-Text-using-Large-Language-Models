Safety
Overview
    This year, team Tsinghua-A utilized synthetic biology’s techniques to build up a system in E. coli which can simulate the complicated relationships within or between populations. We want to simplify the complex systems in nature and draw some interesting conclusions from this concise system. Since any hazardous accidents were unexpected, even if the chassis organism we used were barely E.coli EPI300 and E.coli MG1655, which are classified into Risk Group 1, it was also necessary for our team members who were in charge of the wet-lab experiments to receive indispensable lab safety training. A graduate student, Peng Shuguang, and a PhD student, Wei Lei, in our lab, who are experienced and scrupulous, offered us training on experimental skills and lab safety. Here we want to share our experience on lab safety.
I General Safety Training
    Before we started our experiments, all of our team members responsible for the wet-lab experiments received detailed and rigid training on biosafety and lab safety from Wei and Peng. The training included standard experimental procedures, usage of biosafety cabinets and normative disposal of experimental waste etc. During the first few weeks since we started our experiments, either Wei or Peng stayed with us all the way in the lab to supervise our manipulations. They gave us guidance and enlightened us when necessary. During our time in lab, we kept thorough lab records, including protocols, consideration on error-prone steps and careful discussions etc. None of us conducted experiments on our own until he or she could pass a check on lab safety and experimental operations.
II Chassis Organism Safety
    The chassis organisms used in our project are E. coli MG1655 ΔsidA ΔlacI and E. coli EPI300, both of which are classified into Risk Group 1 and Safety Level 1. Because of this, they do not cause disease in healthy adult humans and are allowed to be operated in open bench. Our genetically modified bacteria were cautiously operated and discarded and surly not released to the natural environment to prevent interference to the natural environment.
III Experiment Safety
    In order to minimize potentially risks that could be brought about by certain instruments and reagents, our members were requested to use normative protective equipment and follow the safety manuals throughout our lab time. Instruments like alcohol burner, centrifugal machine and hazardous reagents like ethidium bromide were carefully used and discarded according to the safety manuals. Gloves, lab coats, pants and close-toed shoes are demanded during lab time, and it is not allowed to touch about when wearing gloves. Besides, no food or drink is allowed in the working space.
