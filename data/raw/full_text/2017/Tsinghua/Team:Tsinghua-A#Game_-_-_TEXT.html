Game overview
    There are many factors (Like initial number of each populations and spatial factors) can have influence on the results of population interactions in our system, and we found that it will be much easier to consider effects of these factors if we can visualize it. Therefore, we designed our game---E.coli War to satisfy our needs.
    Our games are made on structure of html5. The videos below are two short videos of our Fluid E.coli War and solid E.coli War.

   After we designed our game preliminarily, we visited Beijing Perfect World Network Technology Co., Ltd (Perfect World), one of the largest game company in China, to learn more about the design of a game. The useful advice from the experts  help us a lot in improving our E.coli War, making it more fun and easier for kids to play.

    Afterwards, when children played this game during our exhibition in China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM), they found many interesting results which can even promote our understanding of this system. (See more details at Exhibition at National Museum and Game Discovery ) Furthermore, this can also be helpful for our further research design.
Children are playing E.coli War in CSTM!
