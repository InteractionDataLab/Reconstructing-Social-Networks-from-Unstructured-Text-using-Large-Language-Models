Experience Sharing Session
Nanjing, China 5.20.2017
We joined in experience sharing session, held by Fudan University, in Nanjing, China. In this session, undergraduate students from different teams shared our thoughts and experience about team construction, project design, human practice and challenge we were facing. Xiao Ge and Dongyan Liu provided some advice to other teams and shared the fundamental design and progress of our project.
Biology Undergraduates Development Symposium (BUDS)
Biology Undergraduate
Development Symposium
Nanjing, China  5.21.2017
BUDS contains a serious of academic practices for participants, including poster session, oral lecture and visiting Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University. During this symposium, we presented a poster about our project and received a lot of feedback about experimental design and workflow. Our poster was chosen as the best poster in this symposium.
Communication with other teams
Besides focusing on our experiment, we also held a series of one-to-one communication with Tsinghua A, BNU-China and XMU-China. We exchanged our experiment and advice with each other. For example, XMU-China proposed the idea that microfluidics might be a useful technique for AFT detection.
Scientific Lecture for Senior High School Students
Scientific Lecture for
Senior High School Students
Zhengzhou, China, 8.18.2017
In Zhengzhou No.1 Middle School, we held a lecture for students about synthetic biology and iGEM. To raise the interest of high school students to synthetic biology, we focused on the whole picture and history of this subject, and presented some hot spot of synthetic biology. We also introduced iGEM and the experimental design of our project this year.
Tsinghua iGEM of the Past Ten Years.
To retrospect the history of Tsinghua iGEM and summarize our experience, we interviewed some former member of Tsinghua iGEM and made a documentary video about the history and development of iGEM in Tsinghua University. Former members of Tsinghua iGEM not only recalled their memory in Tsinghua iGEM, but provided some important suggestion for our project.
Communication with Beijing Genomics Institute(BGI)
At BGI
Shenzhen China, 8.7.2017
We visited BCI, which is one of the best institute of synthetic biology in China, and communicate with their director and researchers. Though this activity, we learned more about the development of synthetic biology in China and received some valuable suggestion for our project.
Conference of China iGEMer Committee
Fuzhou, China, 8.23-24.2017
During CCiC, we communicated with other teams about the experimental design, experience and future direction of iGEM in China. We also took part in poster session to introduce our project to other teams and gained “certificated participant” award.
