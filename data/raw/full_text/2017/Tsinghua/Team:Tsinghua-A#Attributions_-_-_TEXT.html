Attributions
    We sincerely thank every person and every organization that gave our team a favor or provided us with guidance or material support. We would also like to thank every person and every organization that are not mentioned below but once afforded assistance to us. Without their contributions, even if we might complete our project, yet it would have been impossible for us to make it fun. Finally, thanks to every member and the instructors in our team. With their contributions, we have not merely accomplished a good project, but also harvested an unforgettable experience.
I Sponsors
II Members Contributions
Li Shuailin was responsible for design of gene circuits, the orthogonality test and construction of parts. Also, he was involved in the construction of fluid model.
Zhang Chi was involved in conducting wet-lab experiments, especially in creating a new part.
Li Siting developed the game of solid medium and came up with the idea of analogizing the competition among bacteria to typical history events. She contributed to the wiki of game and discovery. She was also involved in the work of human practice.
Zhu Rongping primarily made an effort to implement the game based on the fluid medium.
Kang Zifeng contributed to modeling and programming work, especially AI algorithms. Besides, he came up with the original idea of this project.
Gang Qiang was mainly responsible for the construction of our Wiki and some job in human practice.
He Wanlin was mainly responsible for the construction and testing of different parts as well as experimental designing. She will be presenting our project at the Great Jamboree.
Wang Zhaojian is one of the two leaders of Team Tsinghua-A in 2017. This year he basically got involved in almost everything from lab work, human practice planning to Wiki editing.
Wang Chenghao undertook the work of designing and assembling the genetic circuit of Farmers.
Tang Ruixiang is the other leader of Team Tsinghua-A in 2017. He was in charge of designing and constructing the game based on the solid medium.
Chen Yixin is interested in programming and also keen on the colorful biology world. He has devoted to Wiki construction and modeling.
III Advisors and instructors
Prof. Wang Xiaowo
He, together with Prof. Xie, opens a curriculum of synthetic biology and all of our members have took it. He gave us lectures on both biology and programming. He also provided us with constructive proposals and papers relevant to our project.
Prof. Xie Zhen
He offered us instructive guidance in the course. Additionally, he lent us a welcoming area in his laboratory for us to carry out our experiments. We were also given access to lab equipment and reagents.
PhD student Wei Lei
He taught us elementary experimental operations. Apart from that, he supervised our experiments for several weeks and gave us plentiful guidance.
Graduate student Peng Shugang
He helped us a lot solving problems we met when doing experiments. He also supervised our project and provided us with inspiring suggestions.
IV Acknowledgements
    We are subsidized by the Department of Automation and Bioinformatics Division in Tsinghua University. We are also indebted to SyngenTech for making brochures on iGEM and team uniforms. Furthermore, we are grateful to Biomatters for offering us access to Geneious which is a useful software in molecular biology research. We also appreciate IDT for synthesizing some essential genes. We would like to thank team NPU-China for helping us knockout of the genes, LacI and SdiA, in E. coli MG1655. Thanks to Perfect World and China Science and Technology Museum, we had opportunities to carry out human practice and let more people to know iGEM and synthetic biology. Thanks to Team Fudan ’s invitation, we sent two team members to the BUDS conference and received lots of insightful feedback. Furthermore, we are grateful to Xie Lab for offering us E. coli EPI300 which were utilized to construct plasmids. We appreciate being helped by the laboratory technician and members in Xie Lab as well.
