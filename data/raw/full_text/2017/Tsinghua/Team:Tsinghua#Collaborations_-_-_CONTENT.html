By collaborating with these four iGEM teams, we can seek out help whenever needed and receive prompt feedback about our project design and Wiki contents.

In retrospect, it turned out to be a very worthy journey with them.

                  During the brainstorming stage, we shared our ideas to each other and got useful suggestions to modify details. And whenever we got results, whether positive or negative, we would discuss and analysis together.

University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “goodbye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after. In the future, we would really look forward to creating more memories with them.

Introduced by Xuan Wang, advisor of team SHSBNU-China, we got in touch with Yihao Zhang, advisor of team Peking. We connected with Genscript in Nanjing and shared necessary information we needed to all of us. Then Yihao went to Nanjing by train on his own and delivered parts. Here we thank the two teams for their collaborations.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="sales"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-sm-7"><H2 class="increase-text">Start following YeasyAFT on wechat now</H2></DIV><DIV class="col-md-3 col-sm-4"><BUTTON class="btn btn-trial2" onclick="location.href='https://2017.igem.org/Team:Tsinghua/wechat'">Following us on wechat</BUTTON></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><FOOTER><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-8 col-sm-8"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-6"><UL class="list-inline access-links"><LI><A href="#overview" class="page-scroll">Overview</A></LI><LI><A href="#tsinghua_a" class="page-scroll">With team Tsinghua-A</A></LI></UL></DIV><A href="#pku_shsbnu" class="page-scroll">With team Peking and SHSBNU-China</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
