I Introduction
Even though we have orthometric gene circuit, the killing ability of two warriors may have great difference. [Fig.1]
RFP is used to indicate the LacI level inside warrior, so it can indicate the killing ability of warrior. From this figure, we can see that the LacI level inside warrior I increase at a very fast speed. In real situation, this means that warrior I will be killed at the beginning.
Therefore, in our project, it may be necessary to regulate killing ability to an appropriate level. Intuitively, many potential factors can influence the killing ability, like the catalysis rate of AHL synthase, cross-membrane rate between AHL molecules. Then what factors can we change to regulate the killing ability of warriors? Our model suggest that it is possible to regulate the killing ability of two warriors by just changing the promoter intensity of some proteins.
II Evaluation of warrior's killing ability
First, to simplify the evaluation, we will have some hypothesis at first:
1. The increasing rate of two warriors are the same.
2. The environmental capacity (it is mentioned in the famous Logistic model) of two warriors are the same if the environmental conditions and the initial amount of resources are the same. (By these hypothesis, we can ignore influence of growth rate on killing ability, which will make things more complicated.)
3. Also, we could only consider the condition that there is glucose inside the medium and there is only warrior lived in the medium.
4. RFP intensity is used to indicate the amount of LacI, so it can indicate the killing ability of the warrior. This means in our model that the warrior cannot actually kill another warrior, but can activate the RFP expression of another warrior. And more RFP inside cell means the cell is killed more by warrior in other side.
Then we can evaluate killing ability by looking at change of RFP intensity as time inside each warrior. The initial amount of them is same.
III Gene circuit of warrior in the model
Note: Here for simplicity, we hypothesize that this gene circuit is orthometric.

VI Results of model
Note: Since we have assumed that the increasing rate and carrying capacity of two warriors are same, so in the model, the amount of two warriors are same at all the time.
1. Results under original parameter sets:
(Fig. 3 RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II)
As stated above, RFP intensity is used to indicate the killing ability of the warrior. From this original parameter set and result, we can see that since the maximal expression rate of RFP of two warriors (Indicating the amount of LacI) have large difference, so the maximal killing abilities are different largely. In the real situation, this means that the warrior I has higher amount of LacI and thus less CmR so it has less resistance to chloramphenicol and slower growth rate.
The first step we can do to regulate maximal killing ability is to increase/decrease the maximal expression rate of warrior I/II. In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the RBS after Prhl in warrior. For example, we can increasing the maximal expression level of RFP inside warrior II to increase the killing ability of warrior I.
2.  Increasing the maximal expression rate of RFP inside warrior II
Change beta1AHL1 from 6e3 to 6e4
(Figure 4 RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II beta(1AHL1 )=6e4)
From this, Even the maximal expression intensity of AHL promoter of two warriors are the same, we will think warrior II still have much higher killing ability than that of warrior I. This is because its killing ability is high at the beginning, so warrior I may be killed at a very fast speed at the beginning. And sometimes we may not only want to regulate their maximal killing ability, but also want to regulate their killing ability in real time. (You can imagine that in a war, warrior II accumulate strength at a very fast speed and kill warrior I immediately, though their maximal strength is same. And what you want to do here is actually equivalent to regulate their speed of accumulating strength.)
Therefore, how could we do? Intuitively, we may think that if warrior II express less LuxI so that 3OC6HSL accumulate slower, so the speed of accumulating strength is slower. These hypothesis can both be demonstrated by our model.
3. Decrease the expression rate of LuxI inside warrior 2
(Figure 5: RFP level inside warrior I and warrior II beta(1AHL1 )=6e4,beta_const1=6)
By doing this, we can regulate the accumulating strength speed of warrior successfully! In the experiment, this can be achieved by changing the constant promoter or RBS of LuxI in warrior II.
In conclusion, the core is that we can regulate the maximal killing ability by regulating amount of LacI (In this model, RFP) and regulate the speed of accumulating strength by regulating amount of AHL-production enzyme inside cell. All these can be regulated by change the promoter/RBS of the protein or adding LVA tag after the protein experimentally.
According to the results obtained from our model, it is clear what we should do in the experiment to achieve the goal.
