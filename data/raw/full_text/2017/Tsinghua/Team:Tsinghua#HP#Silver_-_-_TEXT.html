Safe and good
Safe and food
It is quite important to keep our product safe, responsible and good for the whole society. To look into the real concerns of citizens in the community, we designed a questionnaire and asked people in our neighborhoods to answer the questions.
As it turned out, peoples tend to pay more attention to the safety of our product, as well as easy manipulation and high sensitivity (Figure 1).
Figure1. The relative score of priority of listed concerns.
It has to be noted that, the larger the relative score is, the more prior the concern is.
To fulfill peopleâ€™s demands and make our product safe and good, we carefully designed our product. We guarantee that all yeast is fettered in a package and none of them can escape, which can avoid potential risks caused by genetically-modified yeast. And we closely monitored the proof-of-concept experiments to make sure that our product can really benefit the society. More details can be seen in the product design part.
