Han Jianing
Jianing Han is the leader of Team Tsinghua in 2017 and the major designer of our project.
His primary responsibilities include recruiting the team, leading the design of the project, fundraising for project expenditure, and coordinating between instructors and team members.
Ge Xiaofei
Xiaofei Ge was in charge of protein extraction experiments in our projects and our star in human practice. She attended our communication with BGI and iCX, and presented our poster in CCiC.
Gao boyang
Baoyang Gao is the vice leader of Team Tsinghua in 2017 and one of the designers of our project.
She contributed a lot initiate design of sensor system, molecular clone and parts construction. and employed GFP to validate the efficiency of GAL promoter and sensor system.
Liu Dongyan
Dongyan Liu is has been consistently contributing tremendously to yeast transformation to construct AFT sensor and reporter system in yeast. She also contributed to molecular clone and presented our project in CCiC to communicate with other iGEM teams.
Jia zeran
Zeran Jia contributed to molecular clone and yeast experiments
and assisted the construction of our Wiki site.
Lan yuxuan
Yuxuan Lan contributed to molecular clone and was in charge of parts construction. He also assisted in human practice, including communication with BCI and iCX, and commemorative activity of the 10-year history of Tsinghua iGEM.
Zhou Siyan
Siyan Zhou is originally proposed using hexose transferase as the reporter, which is one of the most exquisite parts in our project. She constructed the plasmids that form the scaffold of yeast two-hybrid system and pushed the accomplish of yeast experiments.
Ma Hongpeng
Hongpeng Ma is our talented programmer. He was in charge of our server, which was used to store and process data, and the construction of our website. He also devoted his talent and energy in building our quantitative model. He also do some experiment.
Hu Yan
Yan Hu contributed to molecular clone and functional experiments in our project.
He built our quantitative model and the director of our scientific lecture for high school students.
Yang Tianrui
Tiaorui Yang is our brilliant artist. She designed our website, team uniform, poster and pattern diagrams for presentation. She also contributed to molecular clone and attended CCiC.
Lu yao
Yao Lu is the advisor of Team Tsinghua this year, and the team leader of the same team as leader. During the competition, she shares the experience of last year and gives us constructive advice.
