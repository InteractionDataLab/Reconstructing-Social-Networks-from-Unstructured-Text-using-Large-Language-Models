Overview
Knowing that collaboration is the tenet of iGEM competition, this year we have collaborated with three iGEM teams, a high school team (SHSBNU-China) and two undergraduate teams (Tsinghua-A, Peking). By collaborating with these four iGEM teams, we can seek out help whenever needed and receive prompt feedback about our project design and Wiki contents.
Collaboration with team Tsinghua-A
Having been known each other for a long time, we were quite thrilled to reach out to our old friends Zhaojian Wang, Shuailin Li, Chenhao Wang, Chi Zhang and Wanlin He, five team members from Team Tsinghua A, and form a very healthy and constructive relationship with them. In retrospect, it turned out to be a very worthy journey with them.
During the brainstorming stage, we shared our ideas to each other and got useful suggestions to modify details. And whenever we got results, whether positive or negative, we would discuss and analysis together.
Their team consists of students from school of life science or department of automation. With friends majoring in life science we could talk about strategy and technology in wet lab works, while with those from department of automation in their team, we could exchange experiment in terms of math and modeling.
Zhaojian and Chenhao, with excellent social skills, were able to get in touch with many other iGEM teams and invite them to Tsinghua University. Zhaojian always shared the information with us and communicated with them together. Additionally, Zhaojian took great photos during communications.
Thanks Team Tsinghua-A! we fight together. University’s Biotechnology Building has seen the two teams spend entire summer vacation in the lab for their project and force their ways out towards light and truth together. A day usually started with two teams’ early morning greetings at the building hall and ended up with “goodbye” in the evening. The way back to dorm listened the bitter and sweet they shared with each other. What a great scene we created. What a goal we have been always chasing after. In the future, we would really look forward to creating more memories with them.
Collaboration with team Peking and SHSBNU-China
In the process of parts delivery, we met trouble that all of the courier companies cannot express our parts in time because the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was going on and traffic restrictions became much more rigorous. Introduced by Xuan Wang, advisor of team SHSBNU-China, we got in touch with Yihao Zhang, advisor of team Peking. We connected with Genscript in Nanjing and shared necessary information we needed to all of us. Then Yihao went to Nanjing by train on his own and delivered parts. Here we thank the two teams for their collaborations.
