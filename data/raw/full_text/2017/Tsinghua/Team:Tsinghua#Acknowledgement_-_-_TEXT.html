General guidance
We would like to appreciate general guidance from Prof. Dai Junbiao, Prof. Chen Guoqiang and Prof Sun Zhirong, as well as their lab members. They have carefully supervised our project all over the year and provided insightful advices on project feasibility, experiment troubleshooting, presentation addressing, and so on. It is their help that allow us to make such achievements.
Lab Space
Thanks to Prof. Dai for providing laboratory space for us to do experiments. Our access to all lab equipment and reagents is quite dispensable for our project. Also thanks to all lab members for their generous help during our experiments as well as tolerance for our constant occupancy of the lab space. Dai lab provides experimental facilities that are essential for the molecular cloning and general bacteria- and yeasts-related experiments, such as yeast transformation and culture.
Material and Facility Supporty
Thanks to Tsinghua Experimental Platform for their support on Nikon fluorescent microscope, as well as flow cytometry.
Financial support
Thanks to School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua and the Tsinghua Xuetang Life Sciences Program for their financial support, including both experiment and journey costs.
Thanks to Wuxi Qinglan Biotech for their generous synthesis of the two important ScFv DNA sequence.
