Communication with other teams
Help High School Team CIEI-BJ
We communicated with CIEI-BJ, a high school student-team. As we were more experienced laboratory fellows, we were glad to share the details of experimental techniques and design with them. Moreover, we led them to our labs and gave them safety guidance, which was much more important than experimental details.
Scientific Lecture for Senior High School Students
Scientific Lecture
Zhengzhou, China, 8.18.2017
In Zhengzhou No.1 Middle School, we held a lecture for students about synthetic biology and iGEM. To raise the interest of high school students to synthetic biology, we focused on the whole picture and history of this subject, and presented some hot spot of synthetic biology. We also introduced iGEM and the experimental design of our project this year.
