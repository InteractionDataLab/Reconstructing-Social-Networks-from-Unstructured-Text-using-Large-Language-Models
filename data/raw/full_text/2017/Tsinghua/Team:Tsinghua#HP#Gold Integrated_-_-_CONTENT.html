                    Considering that glucometer is the final procedure of our biosensor, we surveyed how many citizens own glucometer. As it turned out, 28.7% of surveyed citizens have a glucometer. Though not that much, it indicates that using glucometer as readout is feasible. 

                    </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row space50"><DIV class="col-md-12"><P class="description">
                        To target potential customers that may not want to buy a new glucometer to test AFT, we also considered using color as readout. However, it seems that yeast is not easy to get colorful and the coral chromoprotein spisPink cannot change yeast’s color. So this is not involved in our final design. 
                        We also want to know whether citizens are willing to let our biosensor ferment for several hours in their home, so we asked whether they have fermentation experiences. As it turned out, 58.3% of investigated citizens do have their experiences to ferment something at home. This is a good news for the spread of our product.

                        Except for product design, we also want to know how citizens are familiar with AFT. The result is not that satisfying. Only 61.6% of surveyed people know that AFT cannot be depleted by any kind of cooking method. This may leave the 38.4% believing that, although AFT can cause cancer, it cannot do harm to our health because we eat cooked food instead of raw ones, which is absolutely not the truth.

                        At the same time, despite most people know that AFT can contaminate nuts, oil and crops, only 8.2% know that it can also contaminate meat and dairy products. This may also weaken their alerts when choosing meat and dairy products.

                        All these indicate that we still need to strengthen the propagation of AFT safety issue. So we investigated how people get safety information. According to the questionnaire result, TV program and Facebook counterparts (like WeChat, QQ and so on) are the major information source, indicating that propagation in these two ways is the most efficient.
