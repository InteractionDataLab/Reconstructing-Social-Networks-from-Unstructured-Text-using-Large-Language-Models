Communication Conference at Nanjing University
Participants: Nanjing University, Tsinghua University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University,                         Fudan University, Tianjin University, Sun Yet Sun University.
On May 20th, our members attended the iGEM communication conference,                        which was held by nanjing-china and nju-china, in School of Life Science, Nanjing University.
We shared the experience of Giant Jamboree and discussed how to establish a team,                         bring up new ideas and assign works. We also introduced our projects, gave our suggestions and shared fresh ideas.                         Through the communication we learned from each other, which was a great help to our 2017 iGEM projects. Besides,                         realizing the fact that present alignment CCIC, which is Central China iGEM Consortium,                         could not meet the trend of Synthetic Biology’s development, we introduced our last year’s project, iMAP,                         which can be used to construct a bridge between different iGEM teams. Finally, the meeting was a complete success.
5th iGEM Asia Pacific Conference in National Chiao Tung University
The 5th iGEM Asia Pacific Conference was held in at National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan from 2017/07/30 to 2017/08/04.
There were more than 20 teams from different universities in Asia and America attending this conference.                         Through the presentation and poster exhibition, we exchanged information and experience with one another,                         which benefited us a lot. Besides, communicating with professors and other software teams helped to simulate                         our creativity and bring about more ideals. After the conference, we kept in touch with USTC-Software,                         who also focused on developing software, and the communications between us helped us to deal with tough problems together.
Through these colorful and meaningful human practice activities, we harvested not only the                         communications and friendships among iGEM teams, but also the tight collaborations rooted in these                         friendships. We managed to understand how innovative ideas in synthetic biotechnology sprouted and                         how these ideas going to influence the subject, and even the world.
