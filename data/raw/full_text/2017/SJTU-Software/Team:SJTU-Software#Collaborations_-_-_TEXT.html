Collaborations
This year, we attached much importance to communication and collaborating with other teams.                     Our collaboration could be divided into two parts, collaborating with other iGEM teams and biology companies.
Other iGEM Teams
Through two iGEMer conferences, the Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) and the 5th iGEM Asia Conference,                       we got to know a lot of iGEM teams in Asia, through friendly communication, we reached some effective collaboration.
University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)
USTC-Software is one iGEM team which also concentrated on developing useful software for bio-brick researchers.                                          The similar interest and purpose helped us two teams to work together. During the collaboration,                                          it was their members’ experience that made us realize we should make improvements.                                          They identified the problem that some data in bio-bricks database was inaccurate and these parts should be removed.                                          We have not noticed it before, and we removed some inaccurate bio-bricks from the database according to their suggestions.                                         If not removed, these bio-bricks may cause wrong search results.                                          Moreover, we tested their software Biohub 2.0 and gave some useful suggestions on safety and design.                                          The cooperation between two teams made a “win-win” situation which we were both delighted to see.
SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
To strength communications between collegiate teams and high school teams, we had a in-depth conversation with Shanghai United International School. We exchanged constructive and meaningful opinions on many topics, like the the future tendency on high school level’s development of biotechnology, how to attract more high school to attend iGEM, what can be done to improve cooperation between high schools and colleges and the some problems high school teams are faced with etc.. We concluded that the most serious problems hat most high school teams faced is lacking experience of doing practical bioengineering and necessary professional scientific knowledge,. We came up the idea to build a well-spread network among high school teams to increase the efficiency of information exchange to promote the communication and cooperation. This will also provide the platform and opportunities for collegiate teams to contact and help high school team. What’s more, they have a project to produce a book for pedagogical meaning, which might be more suitable for high school level, and we could help them as adviser. Finally we gave them some aid of instructional significance on how to edit their wiki web page.
Biology Companies
We interviewed several biology companies so that our project can fit the social needs more properly.                       The industrial explorers all gave us their unique suggestions on both biology industry development and our software.
Bluepha
Bluepha is a company that devoted to applying synthetic biology technology to industrial biological manufacturing.                         One of their co-founders, Doc. Haoqian Zhang accepted our interview and discussed the present situation of synthetic biology industry in China based on our iGEM topic.                         We managed to know about synthetic biology more completely, both theoretical and practical.
Yaoyanshe
Yaoyanshe APP is the first platform of pharmaceutical research and development industry and value sharing and trading.                         The founder of Yaoyanshe gave advice on the future industry development in Biology and helped us to polish the idea of our software.
Novelbio Technology Company
Novelbio technology company is a company mainly focused on biological cloud computing. The founder of Novelbio Technology Company,                         Jie Zong, analyzed the potential of biology software for us and upon his analysis we justified our project’s function to meet the future sector demand.
These people are deeply involved in biological industry and their views are quite different from us undergraduates,                       so they can provide inspiring ideas and largely improve our project.
