Since its creation, SJTU-Software has been dedicated to designing and developing useful programs for Synthetic Biology and iGEM community.                     In some official databases, many biobricks are not well annotated and documented, which brings difficulties for researchers in finding biobricks of high quality. To help researchers study biobricks more conveniently and efficiently, we solve these problems with modern information technologies. We have developed a web application named BAT, which means “Biobrick Assist Technology”.
BAT is a suite of synthetic biology aided tools and mainly functions as a search and evaluation engine for biobricks.                     Users may search biobricks by categories, submission time etc. and BAT can evaluate at different levels, even completely new biobricks.                     In this year we have optimized the scoring algorithm to make it work more efficiently.                     Besides, considering the fact that evaluation may not be always perfect, we have developed a small but useful community like Q/A for users to manually select best biobricks.                     Users can score biobricks on our site and leave a short comment. We aim to create a platform for researchers to learn and communicate, hence we are willing to combine it with iMAP-our 2016 iGEM project, which serves as a communicate tool for different iGEM teams.
