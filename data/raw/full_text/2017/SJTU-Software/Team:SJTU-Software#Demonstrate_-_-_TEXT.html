Our BAT Q/A Community is easy to use.
You only need to type a term, for example, promoter, like the pictures shown below.
When you begin to type a term, it also begins to search for related questions.
For example, I put forward a simple question tagged with "Promoter" for test. At the first step I typed "promoter" and the search engine worked and return me this question I had just asked. As is shown in the picture below, users can leave a short comment on this question, maybe a potential answer to it, and can "like" this answer as well. If a question has many "likes" and answers, it can be a hot topic and will be appear in "most frequently answered" column.
One can comment(answer) like this:
Markdown is also available.
