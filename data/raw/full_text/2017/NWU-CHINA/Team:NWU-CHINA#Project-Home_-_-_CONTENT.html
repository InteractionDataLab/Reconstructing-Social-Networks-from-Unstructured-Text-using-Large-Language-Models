Once oil is accidentally leaked into the environment, it will cause a very serious harm. Oil pollution is a problem ailed people for a very long time. For example, oil leaked in ocean will lead intertidal creatures and many marine life to death. When oil enters soil, it will destroy soil structure, disperse soil particles, reduce the water permeability of the soil, limit the nitrification and dephosphorization, so that phosphorus and nitrogen content available in soil will be reduced. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic. With accumulating through the food chain in creature body, it can result in greater harm.  People have tried a lot of method to deal with this problem, such as, oil boom method, mechanical method, adsorption method, chemical treatment, and biological method. However, these methods cannot meet the requirement of environment recovery. For example, oil boom can only treat a small scale of oil spill; chemical reagent used in chemical method can be more poisonous than oil; biodegradation doesn’t have ideal degradation value. Besides, the method to detecting oil spill also has a lot problems in China. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box1"><DIV class="lefttext"><H3>Description</H3><P style="font-size:20px">Oil pollution is one of the environmental issues that attract more and more attention. It not only harms creatures immediately, but cause continuous damage to polluted area, which will cause severe harm to environment. Besides, oil polluted area is hard to recovered as well. So, solving the problem of oil pollution has been a dream of people for a long time.<SPAN style="”font-color:red”">So, recovering areas from oil contamination has been a dream of people for a long time. </SPAN></P><P style="font-size:20px">This year, we opened our mind. We didn’t limit our mind in recovery, but focused on the prevention. There is a saying goes that a small leak will sink a great ship. On analogy of this, many of oil pollutions are caused by oil spill and some some little leak will cause oil spill. If these kinds of leak be found in the beginning, some accident won’t occur any more. Therefore, with using those creature degrading oil, such as bacteria, we are willing to sense oil and find a way expressing this signal to detect leak in a early time. By this way, we want to prevent oil spill and make the world better. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box1"><DIV class="righttext"><P style="font-size:20px">Most of organisms in accordance with the first way to degrading alkane. In organisms, no matter which kind of degradation mechanism, alkanes hydroxylation initiate alkane catabolism pathways. So far, oil-degrading strains found, without exception, have alkane oxidases. Biochemical studies have shown that alkanes oxidized enzymes are the key enzymes in the metabolism of alkanes, and determine the rate of catabolism of alkanes.</P><DIV style="text-align:center">Figure1.
