After acquainted with the catabolic regulation mechanism of alkanes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa DN1, we need a reporter gene to show the condition of the cells after DN1 initiating the alkane catabolism pathway. Here, we chose the chromoprotein RFP (BBa_J00450). We linked it to the downstream of the AlkB2 promoter. After alkane released the inhibition of GntR to the AlkB2 promoter, the promoter plays a role in initiating the downstream gene and expressing the RFP. By this way, we can detect alkane.
