Though we all major in Biology, we master different skills, so we can finish our work by ourselves. This is our team first shot on synthesis biology, so we got together and thinking about what can we do. We search papers, do experiment, do social survey, acquaint public with synthesis biology and so on together. During this time, we get familiar with each other. In the process of finishing our project, we had been confused, met troubles, but with our teamwork, we overcame most of difficulties. At the end of the competition, we all benefit a lot from it.</P><P style="font-size:20px">We appreciate our instructors and advisor. They support us a lot as well when we had problem.
