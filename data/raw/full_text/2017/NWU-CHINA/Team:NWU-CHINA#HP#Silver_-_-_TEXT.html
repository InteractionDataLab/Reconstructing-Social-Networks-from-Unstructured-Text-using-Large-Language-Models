This year, we did a lot of investigations and researches corresponding to our project in our Human Practice session. Firstly, we interviewed product manager of an oilfield in Gansu Province to know the method local oil cooperation detects oil spill. However, what astonished us is they just detect oil spill by view. This method is inefficient and may trigger severe outcome. With many extra factors, such as, temperature, pressure, oil spill caused explosion accident before, which led a lot of people death.
What’s more, we also interviewed SINOPEC Shaanxi Company. From our interview, we learned that the main contaminants in their sewage is alkane. Besides, the device they used to detect alkane in the sewage is really heavy and difficult to take along. After we introduced our project, a novel biosensor for alkane, to them, xxx in SINOPEC confirmed that our project is meaningful and they’re really interested in our project.
By practical investigation like this, we found that our project do have significance to environment and possess application meaning.
What’s more, we also popularized knowledge about synthesis biology and biosafety to the public. Please click here to see the detail.
