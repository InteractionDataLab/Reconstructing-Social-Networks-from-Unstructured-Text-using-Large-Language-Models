We got inspiration from 2016 Sydney Australia. They used regulating circuit in ethylene degradation bacteria as sensor gene and used chromoprotein gene as reporter gene to develop an ethylene detection bacteria. They applied this to evaluating fruit ripeness. We are inspired from this method. Based on our labâ€²s researching, we hope we can utilize the circuit regulating alkane degradation in P.a to construct an alkane detection bacteria.
