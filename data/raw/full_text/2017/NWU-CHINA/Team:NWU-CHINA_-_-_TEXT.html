Alkane Biosensor      
         ——NWU-CHINA
Introduction
We separated oil degradation bacteria DN1 from areas contaminated by oil. As oil degradation is an alternative metabolic pathway in bacteria, there is a manipulator for oil degradation gene, such as GntR. It codes GntR protein, which can bind with promoter on upstream of alkB2.
When alkane exists, GntR will unbind with the promoter, and the RFP gene we added on downstream will express to show a signal. When alkane exists, GntR will unbind with the promoter, and the RFP gene we added on downstream will express to show a signal. We used P.a DN1 and DH5α as our chassis to explore which bacteria will be a better chassis for our device.
