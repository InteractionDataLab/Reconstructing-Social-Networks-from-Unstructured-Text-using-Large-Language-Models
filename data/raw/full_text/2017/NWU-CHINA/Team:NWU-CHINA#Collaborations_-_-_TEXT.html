Team OUC-CHINA also shows kindness to us.:
We went to OUC to learn and exchange information and experience with them. As a old IGEM team, they gave us many suggestions and we got a lot of inspiration from them, especially in the team building.
We helped OUC-CHINA plan and propagandize their summer camp in our own community.
