Safety
In biology research, especially researches using microorganism, biosafety is of almighty importance to researchers, environment, and the public. As far as we are concerned, biosafety  can be divided into two parts, safety operation and BSL of the lab.
Our chassis
We chose E.coli and P.a as our chassis. As we all know, E.coli is a BSL−1 chassis, so we just do experiment on bench with E.coli. As for P.a, it is a kind of conditional pathogen which can cause disease when people immune decrease, so it is commonly in hospital. Disease  caused by this bacteria can be cured. However, as P.a is a BSL-2 chassis, we do experiment in biosafety cabinet with P.a. Besides, when new team member join us, we will train there operation skills and widespread biosafety knowledge to them.
Our part all include coding gene about alkane degradation. It is not harmful to plants or animals.
Safety practice
Before our experiment, we will put on lab coat, gloves and mask to protect us and our sample. During our experiment, we will use alcohol lights,UV illuminator and DNA gel electrophoresis. In this time, we put on gloves and glasses to protect ourselves from UV and TAE. After our experiment, we will sterilize items in contact with bacteria. When we use autoclaves, advisor will be with us to ensure our safety.
What′s more, we also checked our antibiotic is safe enough to use.
