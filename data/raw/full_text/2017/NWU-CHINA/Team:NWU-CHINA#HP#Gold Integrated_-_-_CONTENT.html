Besides, in our daily life, people not in biology major always seem biology research as a mysterious, strange and frightening major. They don’t make any sense of biosafety level. Besides, on the CCIC conference we attended, professor Haoqian Zhang and xxx and xxx also emphasized the importance of Biosafety. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Therefore, we had the idea of spread the knowledge of biosafety and biosafety level among people.</P><P style="font-size:20px">We did a survey to investigate whether this phenomenon around us is prevalent. As we predicted, regardless those ordinary people or undergraduate students in biology major are not familiar with the word ‘biosafety’. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Here is our survey results:</P><P style="font-size:20px">Firstly, we investigate the education level of our survey subject. As the picture shows our questionnaire is mainly for college students, and there are also some doctoral student involved into our survey. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Then we investigated the way our subject acquire biological information in their daily life. As the picture shows that people prefer to get information from book, Internet and cell phone. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Next, we asked their impression to biological genetic research. As the results show that the public are more likely seem this as a creative and mysterious thing. Besides, most of them agree that biological research need to specify the protocol to guarantee the safety. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Then we investigated the population of biosafety and biosafety level among the public. As following results show that the public doesn’t know biosafety knowledge well but they do have a will to acquaint with it. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Finally, we want to know the actual understanding of the survey subject for biosafety level. We gave several creatures and required survey subject match biosafety level with these creatures. These creatures are Cobra, mouse, cat, black widow, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As the results shows, the public confused by this question. We agree that the public don’t have a clear definition of biosafety level in their mind. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Coming to a conclusion, we investigated the issue of biosafety by questionnaires. We asked the public their views about biology, their understanding of biosafety and how much attention they paid to biosafety. Surprisingly, people aren’t afraid to biology. To the contrary, people have a lot of interest in biology, however, they didn’t learn about biosafety scientifically, so that they also have a few of concern about biology. Therefore, popularizing biosafety knowledge is necessary. </P><P style="font-size:20px">In view of this situation, we made a short video to introduce biosafety to freshmen of our college and suggest them share the video with their relative and friends to spread biosafety knowledge. Besides, we also upload this video to famous online video platform in China, such as Youku, Bilibili, Tencent video and so on to spread biosafety knowledge to public. </P><P style="font-size:20px">To watch our video, please click here. </P><P style="font-size:20px">We hope that with our efforts popularizing biological knowledge, we can increase favorability of biology among the public and attract more and more people can be conducive to the biological field. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box1"><DIV class="lefttext"><P style="font-size:20px">What’s more, through our PI, we know that, with the lack of teachers in this novel subject, there is a shortage in academic resources of synthesis biology. </P><P style="font-size:20px">The results of our survey also support this point. Most of people didn’t hear of synthesis biology ever and they don’t know the difference between synthesis biology and genetic engineering. However, people around us have a liberal attitude to synthesis organism and GMOs. </P><P style="font-size:20px">Therefore, we popularized relevant knowledge of synthesis biology and the difference between synthesis biology and genetic engineering on a influential platform, Shaanxi Province Lifescience forum held by Shaanxi Provincial Lifescience Alliance. This alliance composite with few of famous high school, such as, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xidian University, Northwest A&amp;F University, Shaanxi Normal University. By this forum, we acquainted people with fundamental theory of synthesis biology. We have done the best we can to widespread synthesis biology. </P><P style="font-size:20px">to watch the detail, please turn to our Silver HP page. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="box1"><DIV class="righttext"><H3>Video(English Version)</H3><P style="font-size:20px">Here is our Human Practice videio</P><DIV align="center"><VIDEO src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/d/d0/NWU-CHINA-HP01.webm" width="80%" controls="">
