Composite Parts
 Melanin Construct
Melanin composite part
BBa_K2481108
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
melA Part BBa_K193600 .
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
This construct allows us to make Melanin out of L-Tyrosine.

These composite parts come together to complete the pathway from Eriodictyol to Anthocyanin. These constructs are separated due to the size of the genes. It would be too much of a sstrain on the cell to have all of th genes in one or even two plasmids and this is why we needed three separate constructs. These constructs are each submitted
 Zeaxanthin Construct
Zeaxanthin composite part
BBa_K2481107
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
crtY Part BBa_I742154 .
crtZ Part BBa_I742157 .
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
This construct is in the plasmid psB1C3, and will convert our initial molecule Lycopene into our final product, the pigment Zeaxanthin.
 Indigoidine Constructs
Indigoidine composite part 1
BBa_K2481106
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
indB Part BBa_K2481001
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
Indigoidine composite part 2
BBa_K2481109
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
indC Part BBa_K1152013
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
These two composite parts come together to convert our initial molecule Glutamine into Indigoidine. The indB has been shown to increase the yields of Indigoidine as well as it is our original basic part submissions. We had to split our genes into two separate composite part submissions as the size of each was too large to allow for them to be in one plasmid.
