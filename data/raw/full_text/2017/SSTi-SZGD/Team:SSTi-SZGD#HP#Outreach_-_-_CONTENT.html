							To promote the concept of synthetic biology and to propagate iGEM competition, we gave out a discourse at 2017 summer bio camp held annually in our department. The attendees were mostly fresh year students. We briefly described some basicknowledge of synthetic biology and encouraged the participants to think from a synthetic biology or engineering perspective. We also held one session of laboratory tour aimed to give interested fellow students an opportunity to try molecular biology techniques. Hope next year we will attract more students with various ackgrounds to join our journey!
						</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Bottom"><DIV class="right"><P>
							In addition to promote iGEM in our school, we also shared our experience with school students and local residents, so that more people could understand the importance of using genetically modified organisms to benefit the world, and reduce the anxiety of having to worry about GMOs as being some hidden monsters that could destroy our life one day. We believe it was a good starting-point to change people’s perceptions on GMOs.
						</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Professional"><P class="Title">Professional Visits</P><P class="introduction">
					To makes sure that our project setting was rational and workable, we visited two professionals in the field of agricultural~~
				</P><DIV class="left"><P>
						Dr. Wu, executive scientist of Tiehan Ecological Agriculture Research center, Shenzhen instructed us on the method of pesticide residue detection and interrelated knowledge on pesticide application. Different types of pesticide residues can be analyzed by different assays. In addition, Dr. Wu provided us current methods of  pesticide degradation, and a summary table of degradation efficiency. In addition, Dr. Wu gave us some remarks for our project, and made us think about the difference between scientific research and industrial production.
					</P><P>
						Professor Li Xiqing, a specialist in Soil Pollution Control of South China Agricultural University, generously offered us advice on detection of organophosphorus pesticide residues, and made a suggestion to us on the development of pesticide residue degrading system. The need for systematic management of the farm and the real-time monitor is growing. A device can help farmers detecting pesticide residue and analyzing data such as concentration and specific degradation time. He also shared with us his experience of propagating new agricultural technologies to elder farmers. Although the average age of farmers currently in China is 63, given the popularity and widespread of smartphone, wechat and internet access, there is an opportunity for them to harness the convenience of automatic farming system once they learn how to operate it on smartphone.
					</P></DIV><DIV class="right"><DIV class="bottom"><P>
							Further, he encouraged us to go further with the project by trying to commercialize it. Local government has provided generous financial supports to start-up businesses who are from a technology background. It was also through his encouragement we started to participate in various entrepreneurship competitions in the second half of the year.
						</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Entrepreneurship"><P class="Title">Entrepreneurship Competitions</P><P>
					In order to further elaborate our idea on product development, and seek opportunity for start-up funds, we participated in a number of entrepreneurship competitions held in Guangdong province this year. Most of the competitions took place during summer time, and involved many rounds of selection. We end up presenting our project to four different judge panels in a total of ten rounds of selection!
				</P><DIV class="left"><P>
						The major ones were: 2017 Shenzhen &quot;Dream Cup&quot; Collegiate student Innovation and entrepreneurship contest, and 2017 China (Shenzhen) Innovation and entrepreneurship competition. Surprisingly, we ended up making to the 4th place in Health &amp; Biology section of Shenzhen Innovation and entrepreneurship competition, and 1st place in the sub-division contest of ‘Dream up’ competition, and won a RMB￥50,000 (USD$7460) start-up fund!! Lately we have completed the registration of a Bio-tech company under the trademark of “Guardian of the Wheatland” using this seeded money. Most importantly, we received positive feedback from judges on our business idea, and were given credits on the selection of potential customers. This whole experience was very encouraging, given the fact that it was the first time we participated in such high level entrepreneurship competitions! 
					</P></DIV><P class="section">
					And, we just received notice that we made to the TOP50 of ‘G-Idea’ National Collegiate Student Genetic Application Competition, and will present our project once again in November after iGEM!!
				</P></DIV><DIV class="Social"><P class="Title">Social Media</P><DIV class="right"><P>
						Throughout the year, we engaged with various interesting parties through our Wechat Friendship Circle, and public blog. Although physically located in different part of the world, we could still keep in touch with our friends, instructors/advisors, other iGEM teams. We periodically updated our public blog with contents such as entrepreneurship competitions, iGEM regional 
meetings, our experimental progress, and visits to farm/village/garden. SSTi-iGEM 2017 team has attracted quite a big attention: our latest blog article on entrepreneurship competition had over 2300 readings!
					</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Survey"><P class="Title">Survey</P><P class="section">
					We conducted a survey to help formulating our App development. Respondents were asked about their awareness of harmfulness of pesticide residues on food products, opinions on GMOs, and potential interest in using the detection product and App. The survey was conducted with residents and visitors in three large farm markets in Shenzhen, Jieyang and Guangzhou. In total 525 copies of effective filling survey forms were collected.
