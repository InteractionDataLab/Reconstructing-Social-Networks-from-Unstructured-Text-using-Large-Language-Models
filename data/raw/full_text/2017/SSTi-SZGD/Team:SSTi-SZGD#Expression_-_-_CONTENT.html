					Light-regulated gene expression systems provide transient, non-invasive and reversible means to control biological processes, and often serve as an alternative to chemical-induced systems, i.e. IPTG in T7 system (1). In bacterial cells, many photoreceptor-based light sensitive system are two-component regulatory systems that are respond to blue, green or red light. These two-component systems, however, have drawbacks such as complex systems, co-factors dependent, low induction rate, etc. (1,2).
					</P></DIV><DIV class="right"><P>
					In order to efficiently produce enzymes for pesticide residue degradation, and further move onto generate ‘live cell biocatalysts’, we wished to use a system with non-invasive means of recombinant gene expression, as well as being simple, easy to manipulate and with high induction efficiency. During the process of screening previous iGEM works, we came across the Luminesensor (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K819007" target="_blank">BBa_K819007</A>), a single component light-regulated system. By making improvement of Luminesensor with technical guidance from Prof. Yang Yi of Eastern China University (ECU) (3), we obtained a light-repressed system containing a single light repressor LexA-VVD (Figure 1), and a ColE promoter containing a SOS operator sequence for LexA binding, regulates the expression of target genes (Figure 2). This system is referred to LightOFF system, and it was shown to have comparable induction efficiency to chemical-regulated systems, i.e. T7-driven pET system (Figure 3) (3).
					</P></DIV><P class="Headline">Figure 1: </P><P class="section">Schematic diagram of LightOFF system. A blue light sensor VIVID (VVD), which is a small light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain-containing protein from Neurospora crassa, was fused to the C-terminus of DNA-binding domain of LexA repressor of the Escherichia coli SOS regulon to create a light switchable system. Adapted from Chen et al. (2016).
				</P><P class="Headline">Figure 2: </P><P class="section">Schematic diagram of LightOFF system. When the system is exposed to blue light, a cysteine-flavin adduct is formed in the VVD domain, causing conformational changes of the domain and the subsequent dimerization of the fusion protein. The activated protein dimer binds its cognate operator sequence of ColE promoter and represses the promoter activity. Whereas in dark, dimerization does not occur, so the promoter is not repressed and gene expression proceeds.Adapted from Chen et al. (2016)

Red colonies appeared on the plate Indicated that mCherry was expressed. A cell growth study showed that induced cells had increased level fluorescence intensity, while non-induced cells had basal level of fluorescence (Figure 6), suggesting that pLEV1(408)-mCherry has high induction efficiency and low leakage rate, as well as being able to express in wild-type E. coli strain. Together pLEV1(408) light-repressed system was proven to be in good working condition.

					For “live cell biocatalysts”, due to the involvement of GMOs, it is essential to add a precaution step to prevent GMO leakage to the natural environment. We selected a suicide gene that encodes Supernova, which is a mutant form of well-known KillerRed, the first engineered genetically-encoded photosensitizer (4). Photosensitizer contains chromphores that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon illumination, and it is commonly used for illumination-induced destruction of targeted cells (5, 6).

Furthermore, unlike KillerRed, Supernova expression along does not interfere with normal cell growth prior to light irradiation (7).

					(2)  Supernova expression its effect on cell apoptosis by illumination
					DH5a Cells contained pLEVI (408)-supernova vector were inoculated into LB medium with Streptomycin (40 μg/ml) and grown in light irradiance at 37°C until OD600 reached ∼0.3. Then transferred to darkness for 14-20 hr to induce supernova expression. Pink color pelleted cells indicated supernova expression (Figure 9). 100 μl of culture was diluted in 1ml of PBS buffer and divided into two equal volumes. One was irradiated with intensive orange-yellow light (arac mercury light bulb 160-W with an orange-yellow filter, light intensity 1 W/cm2) for 1 h to induce the release of ROS (reactive oxygen species), while the other kept in darkness.

					The results showed that 1) supernova was successfully expressed after darkness induction, as indicated by red color cells visible to naked eyes and increased fluorescence (Figure 9), and 2) subsequent intensive light irradiation caused apoptosis of bacterial cells, as diluted irradiated culture failed to grow, and non-irradiated showed normal cell growth (Figure 9).
