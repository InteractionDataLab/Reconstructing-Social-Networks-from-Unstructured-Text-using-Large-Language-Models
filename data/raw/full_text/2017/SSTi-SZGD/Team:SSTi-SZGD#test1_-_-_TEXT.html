A product for the degradation
of soil pesticide residues
This year our project is to use a light inducible system to control the gene expression of recombinant genes. We used this system to replace chemical induction mechanism as it is more convenient, cost-effective and reversible. We apply this light control system to express a gene that encodes hydrolase to degrade pesticide residues.
As we know china is a large agricultural country, and pesticides residues is a big issue for environment. We hope to develop a method that degrades pesticides residues in soil and water efficiently and effectively. We believe this has a strong implication in sustaining development.
