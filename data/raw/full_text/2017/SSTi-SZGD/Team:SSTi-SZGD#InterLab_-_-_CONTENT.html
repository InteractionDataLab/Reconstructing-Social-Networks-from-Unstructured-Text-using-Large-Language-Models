					As a new iGEM team, we are pleased to participate in the Fourth International Inter-Laboratory Measurement Study this year.
				</P><P>
					This year we are required to test six devices either on plate reader or flow cytometry. Our lab conditions only allow us to experiment with plate reader. These six devices contain promoter and a RBS sequence, as well as a reporter gene GFP. The aim of the study was to test the expression level of GFP under different combination of promoter and RBS. Compared to Interlab study 2016, this year there were three additional devices, and each device contains different promoter in association with a newly allocated RBS. In addition, this year each sample was required to be repeated four times, and the observation time for cell reactions were set to be at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours.
				</P><DIV class="Explain"><P>
						The six devices were tested this year are shown as follows, along with the controls:

							Add 100ul LUDOX 100% into wells A1，A2，A3，A4; add100ul of H2O into wells A2, B2, C2, D2. Measure absorbance at 600nm for all samples in standard measurement modes on plate reader.

							Spin down fluorescein stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube. Prepare 2*fluorescein stock solution(100uM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1mL of 1xPBS.
							
							Dilute the 2*fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1*fluorescein solution and the resulted concentration of fluorescein stock solution was 50uM. The plate was set up with the fluorescein stock in column 1 and an equal volume of 1xPBS in columns 2 to 12. A serial dilution was performed by consecutively transferring 100ul from column to column with good mixing. 
							
							Then repeated serial dilution for rows B, C, and D. Measured fluorescence in standard measurement modes on plate reader, then imported data into Excel.

						Day 1 :Transformed into Escherichia coil DH5a
						
						Day 2: Picked 2 colonies from each plate and inoculated it into 5-10ml LB medium+Chloramphenicaol. Grew the cells overnight (16-18 hrs) at 37℃and 220 rpm.
						
						Day 3: Cell growth,sampling,and assay.
	In total four plates were set up to read,  one plate was for each time point respectively: 0,2,4,and 6 hours. Each plate was set up as shown below.
	Measured absorbance at 600 nm and measured fluorescence in standard measurement modes on plate reader, then imported data into Excel.

					From the results, we suggested that 1) device 2 might be the best device because not only the E. coli. transformants grew normal, but also GFP protein expression was the highest compared to other devices; 2) transformants of devices 1 and 4 did not grow well, but their GFP expression was very high, compared to other devices, therefore we guess that the high protein expression rate somehow slowed down the growth of bacterial cells; 3) transformants of devices 3, 5 and 6 showed normal growth patterns, but their GFP expression levels were comparably low. In conclusion, each device showed different level of GFP expression as well as cell growth condition, which likely to be a direct result of different combination of promoter and RBS sequence.
