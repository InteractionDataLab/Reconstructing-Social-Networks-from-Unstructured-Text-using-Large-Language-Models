						1.Cells were fractionated to yield cytoplasmic by the cell lysis solution ,and periplasmic samples by the Arginine buffer as follows, the E.coil strain cell medium by centrifugation 10000rpm, 5 min.
						
						2.The 1 g cell added 10ml concentration of arginine buffer 0.4mol/L ,pH8.0.

						3.Repeat that steps twice. 
						
						4.Added 200ul to soluble protein solution, to make the bacteria fully suspended and,10min boilingwater to make it inactive.

						•OPH activity assay mixtures (1 mL, 3% methanol) contained 5 μl paraoxon (added from a 10 mg/mL methanol stock solution), 870 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and 100 μL of cells.
						
						•The enzyme activity was measured using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer at 37℃ by monitoring the increases of linear optical density over time at 405 nm as parathion was hydrolyzed to p-nitrophenol (ε405=17,700 M-1 cm-1). Activities were expressed as units (1 μmol of p-nitrophenol formed per minute) per ml (total reaction volume).

						Will be back to the sample all poured on the glass plate, paved into a thin layer, in the shade to make it slowly dry. The dried sample was crushed with a glass rod and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove more than 2 mm of gravel and plant residue. The samples were repeated by four-fold shrinkage, and finally left enough to analyze the sample, and then further with a glass mortar to be ground, all through the 60 mesh metal screen. Sieve the sample, shake well, bottling analysis.

						10g of the soil sample was extracted with 15 mL of methanol: ddH₂O solution (4: 1, v / v) and the mixture was shaken at 200 rpm for 15 minutes. The sieve was then rotated and centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 minutes. The precipitate was treated three times in the same manner and all supernatants were added together. 20 mL of petroleum ether was added to the supernatant to remove lipophilic impurities and the mixture was shaken at 200 rpm for 20 minutes and then the petroleum ether phase , The remaining solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated at room temperature with a vacuum rotary evaporator. The residue was redissolved in 5 mL of methanol, mixed thoroughly in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes and analyzed by HPLC.
