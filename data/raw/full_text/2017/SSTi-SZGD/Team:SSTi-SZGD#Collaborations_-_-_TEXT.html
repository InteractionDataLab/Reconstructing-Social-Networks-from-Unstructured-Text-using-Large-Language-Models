This year is the first time we participate in iGEM competition. Given the little experience we had and the confusions regards to rules and regulations, it was extremely lucky for us to have ShenZhen University iGEM team as a mentor throughout the competition. Right from the beginning on team built-up, members selection, project formulation, to later stage of technical troubleshooting, project progress control, and eventually Wiki and poster formulation, etc. It is fair to say that our project would not even exist without the generous and timeless help from the whole SZU team. You guys are the stars!
In return, we helped them testing CA enzymatic activity and plotting standard curves using two different methods, as we have previous experience (interlab studies and our own project) of generating good results using plate reader in our lab. It was a great learning experience for us this year, and hope we will be able to pass on these invaluable experience to someone else in need in the future.
Besides SZU team, we also received great help and advice from other iGEM teams in the local region. For instance, by participating in Southern China Regional Meeting that was held in May this year, we shared our project idea with the participated teams, including SYSU-China, SUSTC-China, SCUT-iGEM, SZU-China, SCAU-China and SSTi-China, and received constructive suggestions on project formulation and technical approaches.
Through the discussion, we came up with fresh ideas and were able to locate solutions for problems encountered. Altogether it helped enormously to the following progress of our project. Furthermore, iGEM Organizing committee organized an Asian team leaders’ workshop that focused on team building, laboratory safety and practices. We have learned quite a lot about what’s on about iGEM, and how to make a meaningful and beneficial project. Organizer also invited experts from biotechnology industry to present us current developments in the industry, which really opened up our mind.
