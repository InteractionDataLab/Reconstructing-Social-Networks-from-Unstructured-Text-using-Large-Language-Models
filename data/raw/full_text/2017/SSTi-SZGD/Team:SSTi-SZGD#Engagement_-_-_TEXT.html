Expert Visits
Experimental experiences and advice must be learned from the professionals in the agriculture fields. We paid two visits to two professionals with respect to the experimental process of our project.
Dr. Wu, executive scientist of Tiehan Ecological Agriculture Research center, Shenzhen instructed us on the method of pesticide residue detection and interrelated knowledge, such as details and techniques of pesticide application. Different types of pesticide residues can be analyzed by different assays. In addition, Dr. Wu provided us with the existing means of degradation methods, and gave us a summary table of degradation of various pesticide residues. Besides technique advice, Dr. Wu also gave us some remarks for our project, and made us think about the difference between manufacturing and scientific research in terms of pesticide residue degradation products.
We also went to South China Agricultural University University to visit Professor Li Xiqing, whose specialty is on Soil Pollution Control, to get further advice on pesticide residue testing assays. Prof. Li generously offered us a methodology on detection of organophosphorus pesticide residues, and made a suggestion to us on the development of pesticide residue degrading system. The need for systematic management of the farm and the real-time monitor is growing. A device can help farmers detecting pesticide residue and analyzing data such as concentration and specific degradation time. He also shared with us his experience of propagating new agricultural technologies to elder farmers. He pointed out that although the average age of working farmers in current China is 63, given the popularity and widespread of smartphone, wechat and internet access, senior farmers could harness the convenience of automatic farming system as soon as it is connected to their smartphone. Further, he encourage us to go further with the project by trying to commercialize it. Local government has provided generous financial supports to start-up businesses with a technology background. It was through his encouragement we started to participate in various Entreprenuership competitions in the second half of the year.
Education(open day)
To promote the concept of synthetic biology and to propagate iGEM competition, we gave out a discourse at 2017 summer bio camp held annually in the Department of Biological Science and Technology. We briefly passed on some general examples of synthetic biology and also encouraged them to think the problem from a different angle such as synthetic biology or engineering.       they have learned about iGEM Competition、Concept of Synthetic and a lot of basic concepts of synthetic biology associated with laboratory practices.
While trying hard to make a difference in the world, it is also important that we inspire more people to join our journal to protect the natural environment so that people could enjoy a healthier life. We conducted a number of synthetic biology promoting activities to schools and communities, so that more people could realize the importance of using genetically modified organisms to benefit the world, and reduce the anxiety of having to worry about GMOs as being some hidden monsters that could destroy our life one day. In addition, as this is the first time our school participating in iGEM competition, and we are more of a polytechnic type of institute with students more focus on operational capacity, we conducted two sessions of iGEM introduction meeting to over 200 first year students, and one session of laboratory show-up that mainly gave interested fellow students an opportunity to try molecular biology techniques.
Entrepreneurship Competitions
In order to further elaborate our idea on pesticide residue degradation enzyme production, and seek opportunity for potential start-up fund, we participated in a number of entrepreneurship competitions held in Guangdong province this year. Most of the competitions took place during summer time, and involved many rounds of selection. We end up presenting our project to four different judge panels in a total of ten rounds of selection!
The major ones were: 2017 Shenzhen "Dream Cup" Collegiate student Innovation and entrepreneurship contest, and 2017 China (Shenzhen) Innovation and entrepreneurship competition. Surprisingly, we ended up making to the fourth place in Health & Biology section of Shenzhen Innovation and entrepreneurship competition, and 1st place in the sub-division contest of ‘Dream up’ competition, and won a RMB￥50,000 (USD$7460) start-up fund!! Most importantly, we received positive feedback from many judges for our business idea, and were given credits on the selection of potential customers. This whole experience was very encouraging, given the fact that it was the first time we participated in such high level entrepreneurship competitions.
