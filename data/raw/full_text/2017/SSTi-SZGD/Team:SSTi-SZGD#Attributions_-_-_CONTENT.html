As a polytechnic, students from our school have acquired hand-on operational skills through a wider range of curriculum, including microbiological techniques, pharmaceutical techniques, basic medical course, biochemistry, cell biology, etc. These courses provide us with a solid foundation for grasping new technical skills and engaging in product development. The skills we developed in the past couple of years provide our a good platform that help transferring our laboratory experience to real life applications.
				</P></DIV><DIV class="Training"><P class="Title">Training and Experience</P><P>Although most of the students from our school have solid operational skills, we are relatively weak on  theoretical studies, especially in molecular biology and professional English. However, we determined to make a difference in the game by putting more efforts. We spent one whole year preparing the project. We had our PI organized an interest group in December last year to start gathering potential members from different departments, and spent the entire winter holiday studying basic knowledge in molecular biology. Our members of the teams were selected through a number of tests, both the skills and attitude were important to the formation of our team. At the beginning of March, we had many rounds of  theoretical studies provided by our PI Shuqiao Yu, instructor Zhaoying Guan, adviser Wei zhao Chen, and training management center from our school on topics such as molecular biology, synthetic biology, project management, English and laboratory safety. As the project progresses throughout the year, not only we started comprehending more in depth on the concepts of molecular biology and synthetic biology, but also acquired a number of useful skills like how to build a wiki, design a poster, give a presentation in English, etc. 
				</P></DIV><DIV class="Instructors"><P class="Title">Instructors &amp; Adviser</P><P>For a team that is the first time participating in iGEM competition, we could not have done so without the helps from our instructors and advisers. 
					<I>Shuqiao Yu</I> as the &quot;Primary PI&quot; provides training and guidance to us throughout the year. She supports us on molecular biology techniques, such as light control gene expression system construction, verification, pesticide degradation enzyme studies, as well as English training and proofreading. She built a foundation for our project to progress upon.
					<I>Peng Ying</I> as the ‘Secondary PI’ who provides lots of help on project management, fund allocation, laboratory resource allocation, etc.  
					<I>Zhaoying Guan</I> as the &quot;Instructor&quot;shares her project experience of environmental Engineering with us, and gives us lots of advice on how to design a device.
					<I>Weizhao Chen</I> as the adviser from Shenzhen University iGEM team, overlooks the project build-up and progress, he is a safe-guard to our project, makes sure that we are always on the right track.
					<I>Zhanfan Lin</I> as another adviser helps us to develop software, like App, and provides other technology-related support.
				</P></DIV><DIV class="Individuals"><P class="Title">Individuals</P><P>Our team members are from a variety of background and specialties. Most of us who worked in web lab are from Applied Biology Department, and are mostly from 2nd and 3rd year; there are two members who come from department of Information Technology are responsible for wiki building and App design. We also have one member from the School of Design who works primarily on device design for the product .
				</P><P class="SubTitle">Core members</P><P><I>Chen hong</I> is the leader of our team. she is responsible for team organization and day-to-day management by allocating tasks to team members. she is also responsible for cooperation and communications with other iGEM teams and parties. Furthermore, she partly participates in wet lab and provides guidance to some major experiments, such as enzymatic activity and suicide system validation. She writes wiki contents, and is one of the members of the presenting group, reporting our project in the Jamboree.
					<I>Jinquan Huang</I> is the assistant leader, who takes responsibility of most Business plan and product development. He is also one of the members of the presenting group, reporting our project in the Jamboree . Meanwhile, he is the one of the key members writing the content on wiki, and the major organizer for many rounds of entrepreneurship competitions we participated thorough the year.
					<I>Xiaolin Wu</I>  is the core member in the group of human practice. Meanwhile, she is one of the members of the presentation group, participating in writing the presentation contents, business report and the speech draft. In addition, she is also responsible for interlab studies. 
					<I>Canyu Xu</I> is responsible of the biobrick construction and does most of the biobrick works. She also writes the page of parts and partly participates in the writing of judging form. In addition, she assists Xiaolin in human practice, outreach, and collaboration tasks. She is also the presenter for our entrepreneurship  competitions and impresses the judges every time! 
					<I>Yu liu</I> is the core member of the wet lab group and does most work in the target enzyme validation. Meanwhile, she is one of the members of the presenting group and writes the results part on wiki.
					<I>Xiaopei Lin</I>  is another core member of the wet lab group. She is responsible for validation of one of the new genes of our project, and participates in some human practice. She also writes the result part on wiki 
					<I>Qiu cheng</I> is lab technician who makes sure that our laboratory runs smooth and safe. He  assists extensively in many parts of the major wet lab experiments. He is also a core member for interlab studies and writes the interlab section on wiki. In addition, he helps widely in human practice, collaboration and education sessions. 
					<I>Liang li Liu</I> is one of the members of our design team. She designed, made our presenting slides and poster and took part in most of wiki design. Meanwhile, she also participated in interlab studies. 
					<I>Yuhang Yang</I> is responsible for wiki construction, and undertakes most of the wiki framework. At the later stage of the preparation, he coordinates with us extensively by putting different parts of teamwork and information together and organizes the wiki page. He also contributes significantly to the final finish of our project.
					<I>Xuanwei Wu</I> is responsible for wiki and product design, He also contributes significantly to the final finish of our project
