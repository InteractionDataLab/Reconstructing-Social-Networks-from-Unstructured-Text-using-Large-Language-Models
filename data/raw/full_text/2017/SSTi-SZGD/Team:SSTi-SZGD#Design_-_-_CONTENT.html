With the large demand of food products and commodities, pesticide usage increases annually. The hidden problem of pesticide residues on both human health and environment started to emerge and attract attentions (ref). This year, SSTi iGEM team strives to apply synthetic biology methodologies to solve this environmental and health issue.
					</P><P>We used a state-of-art light-controlled gene expression system in E. coli. to efficiently and effectively produce hydrolases that degrade two mostly used pesticides: organophosphate and carbendazim. By using this light-controlled system, we omit the use of chemical inducers (i.e. IPTG), and try to make the entire production procedure more convenient, economical, and reversible. Furthermore, we designed an automatic spraying system that helps customers using our products in the designated farmland. Altogether, we hope to help protecting our health and environment, and contribute to the sustainable development in China.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Expression"><P class="Title">Expression</P><DIV class="content"><P>For our light-off expression system, we improve a light-controlled gene expression system based upon technique provided by Eastern China University (ECU). Molecular biology modifications were conducted under the supervision of Dr. Ying Dong of ECU and finally a light-off expression vector named pLEV1(408) was generated.(ref) This expression vector allows an overexpression of target gene under dark condition, and a complete inhibition of expression in response to visible lights.

						Organophosphorus and carbendazim are two of the most commonly used pesticides around the world. Two genes called mpd and mheI could encode hydrolase that hydrolyzes those pesticides with good effects: toxicity of the metabolites reduces approximately 100 times. Genes mpd and mheI were isolated from Pseudomonas and Nocardioides respectively. In order to efficiently produce these hydrolases we chose to express the genes using light-off expression system. The genes were commercially synthesized, and were cloned into pLEV1(408) expression vector. Gene cloning was validated by colony PCR, plasmid digestion and Sanger Sequencing, whereas gene expression was analyzed via SDS-PAGE, ELISA, and enzymatic assays. 
					</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Super"><P class="Title">Super scavenger</P><DIV class="content"><P>By successfully using light-off system to express genes for hydrolase production, we devoted to grasp the advantages of our expression system for the purpose of commercializing the finding of the project. Enzymes (hydrolases) could degrade pesticide residues in soil, water, or even on the crop surface. Taken from the advice and suggestions from various interested parties, we planned to develop two forms of products: enzyme product and whole cell product, which can be used for difference situations based on different customer requirements. 
					</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Suicide"><P class="Title">Suicide system</P><DIV class="content"><P>For the whole cell product, because the involvement of GMOs, it is essential to add a precaution consideration to prevent the potential leakage to natural environment. We chose a suicide gene called Supernova, which is a mutant form of well-known KillerRed, the first engineered genetically-encoded photosensitizer. Photosensitizer contains chromphores that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon illumination, and it is commonly used for light induced destruction of targeted cells. Combined with our light-off expression system, we could manage the production of the enzymes, as well as the death of the bacteria cells as required, purely by using visible lights.
