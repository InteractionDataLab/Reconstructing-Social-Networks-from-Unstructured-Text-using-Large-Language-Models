Basic Parts
Four Basic parts were built this year.
(1) BBa_K2244004
Coding region of mheI, a functional gene encoding a carbendazim (Methyl-1H-Benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate, or MBC) hydrolyzing esterase that degrades MBC pesticide.
(2) BBa_K2244005
Coding region of LEV1, a conjugated gene encoding a fusion protein LexA-VVD.
(3) BBa_K2244006
Regulatory sequence ColE promoter, which contains a SOS operator sequence for the binding of LexA protein.
(4) BBa_K2244003
A signal peptide and a coding region of opdA. This is an improved part of BBa_K215090 (iGEM Washington 2009), which contains a functional gene (opdA) that encodes organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) to degrade organophosphate pesticides. In order to develop live cell biocatalysts, we fused a TorA signal peptide of E. coli Tat translocase to the N-terminal of opdA to facilitate the protein exportation to periplasmic space of E.coli.
Composite Parts
Three Composite Parts were built this year.
(1) BBa_K2244009
A Light-repressed gene expression device (LightOFF system). LEV1 repressor binds to operator sequence of ColE promoter thus halts the transcription of reporter gene mCherry
(2) BBa_K2244011
A heterologous proteins exportation component. Once the lightOFF system is activated by light repression, opdA hydrolase is produced and exported to the periplasmic space of E. coli cells.
(3) BBa_K2244010
A light-regulated biosafety device adapted from the lightOFF system. Once the lightOFF system is activated by light repression, supernova is produced and accumulated in the cells. Subsequent light illumination leads to release of ROS from supernova and causes cell apoptosis.
