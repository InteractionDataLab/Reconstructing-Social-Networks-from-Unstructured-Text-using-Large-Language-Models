Vivian
Hello, this is Vivian. It is really my honor to have this opportunity for iGEM. I’m one of the students in ShenZhen Insititute of Technology, my major is Electronic Commerce.
In five years, I have systematically studied Internet Promotion, Web Design, Web editot, etc. I also joined in Electronic Commerce Club to learn more knowledge and skills. In the past, I took part in various competitions and won many prizes. Now I hold the senior certificate in Web Design, so I’m good at Search Engine Optimization and Web Design.
Joyce
It’s a splendid opportunity to participating the iGEM competition this year!I’m a senior student in Shenzhen Institute of Technology and my major is in BioSciences. I love exploring new things and challenging myself. Obviously, iGEM competition a huge challenge for me!
I am responsible for planning Human practice,fill in the web content, design our team uniforms, besides conducting basic wet lab experiments in a daily basis.
Rebekah
My name is Rebkah Chen hong , I am a leader of SSTI-SZGD in 2017,  I am a senior student at Shenzhen Institute of Technology, and major in Biosciences. As a matter of fact, it is the first me participating in iGEM competition, but I have a long interest in solving environmental related issues using biology methods.
Personally, I’m an outgoing girl.I love various sports, such as  taekwondo, yoga, jogging and so on, I also love reading novels and pop music. I look forward to having a good time in iGEM this year and can’t wait to meet with fellow students from other teams in the jamboree in November!
