Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.

SILVER
Collaborated with another iGEM team
Created a BioBrick part central to our project
Successfully participated in Human Practices
Judging note: We would like to note that due to a judging form mishap, we did not fill in the Silver Medal parts requirement with any BioBrick IDs. However, since any of our mScarlet, copper sensor, or mf-Lon parts could fulfill Silver Medal criteria I, we humbly ask that judges evaluate those parts, and/or the parts listed on our judging form for best part collection and best composite part as proof of our fulfillment of the criteria. Thank you for your consideration.
