Have a Skype conversation with James Morris, the director of Alcohol Academy, a charity based in London, United Kingdom, which aims to promote effective alcohol harm reduction by working with and supporting local alcohol roles and commissioners 2. Ask him about his opinions on the potential impacts the AlcoPatch might have on our society&quot;,Qualitative,Suggested that an alcohol awareness patch like ours might be useful to health professionals who are trying to make people more conscious of how much alcohol they consume; learned about the “multidimensional aspects” to alcohol consumption and how an awareness tool would have limited impact in reducing alcoholism,,&quot;Rather than talking about how our patch can reduce alcohol consumption, it would be more appropriate to discuss how our patch could help make people more aware of how much they are drinking; also need to take into account many other factors that affect the actual level of intoxication of an individual, e.g. size, weight, etc.&quot;,

Converse with members of Addiction Dependency Solutions (ADS), an addiction charity based in Manchester, United Kingdom (UK), which provides a range of drug and alcohol recovery services across the North and Midlands of UK 2. Gain feedback on how AlcoPatch would be beneficial for the public&quot;,Qualitative,&quot;It was suggested that members of the public who have intentional addiction would choose not to use it and that the AlcoPatch would be more successful in raising awareness of alcohol consumption rather than a prevention tool, similar to the earlier suggestion by Alcohol Academy&quot;,,&quot;AlcoPatch would likely be effective in early intervention, where efforts are made to prevent addiction before it takes hold; another good suggestion would be to introduce the AlcoPatch in health kits and making them available in bars and clubs&quot;,

Explain project to members of Alcoholics Anonymous, founded as a fellowship of individuals who share their experience in the engagement of unhealthy drinking habits&quot;,Qualitative,&quot;Members believed that our patch has the potential for individuals who are thinking of cutting down on alcohol consumption and those who are on alcohol-related probation, however, most people would not want to use it out of embarrassment; mentioned how alcohol consumption always lingers in the mind: it is a psychological condition where one actively tries to reduce their awareness&quot;,,Students might benefit from such a patch as it would help them keep track of their alcohol consumption; it would make them aware of how much they are consuming before an addiction has the opportunity to take hold,

Meet with Lynn Sheppard, the director of Manchester Enterprise Centre and Martin Henry, an Enterprise Academic Lecturer about our project 2. Posed the question of 'how our AlcoPatch (if the prototype is made) is going to be cheaper than current breathalysers'&quot;,Qualitative,Lynn and Martin suggested investigating whether our AlcoPatch was a novel idea or just a recalibration of existing designs; They also mentioned that we should be cautious about making too much of our product’s science available to the public as it could have patenting issues,,&quot;Realized that cost could be an important issue, and later modelled different designs and their relative costs; After the meeting, we came up with some interesting ideas, including using the similar mechanism behind AlcoPatch to detect other chemicals, such as glucose, because the profit margins and the acceptable costs could be considerably higher; This led us to conduct a pilot experiment on glucose detection&quot;,

Discuss the financial aspect of the patch - 'Will it be more cost effective than the breathalyser?' &quot;,Qualitative,&quot;Learned that Cell-free Mechanism could have marketing issues, and as such, in making the actual prototype, looking for suitable alternatives for ABTS that do not pose a risk to the consumers would be crucial&quot;,,It was suggested that we see an Intellectual Property (IP) attorney in order to protect and patent our project; we decided to contact an IP lawyer and a patent attorney to obtain more information about the legal process that could be involved with the production of our AlcoPatch,

Discuss the commercial issues with ethanol detection patches - mainly their durability 4. Discuss other products currently or were previously in the market, such as smart phone apps to test breath alcohol levels and skin patches for drug testing in the 1980's&quot;,Qualitative,&quot;Learned that some companies claim their patches last for a week or more, but in reality it is much less than; to market something like our product, we would need proof of concept&quot;,,&quot;Realized the inherent problem of typical detection products with the time lag between the measurement and result due to the patches needing to be removed and sent off to a lab to be analysed; however, AlcoPatch would give a real time detection and indication which is very practical&quot;,
