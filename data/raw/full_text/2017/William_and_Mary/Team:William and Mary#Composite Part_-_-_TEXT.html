We are nominating our pLac mf-Lon ( K2333434 ) construct for best composite part. This part was a cornerstone of our efforts to produce a modular method to alter gene expression speed, enabling us to test a wide variety of protease concentrations with ease. All of our primary characterization was done using this part, and we think that it will prove invaluable to anyone who wants to test a variety of mf-Lon concentrations without having to undergo a large number of cloning steps. As we demonstrated with our IFFL circuit, this part can also be used to produce fully functional circuit motifs, and as such could be used as part of a proof of concept or final implementation of other projects. We'd like to note that this part should fulfill our silver medal criteria, for more information please see our for judges page.
