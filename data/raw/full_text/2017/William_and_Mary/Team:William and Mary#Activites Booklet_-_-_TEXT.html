Since creating the Synthetic Biology Curriculum in 2015, we have had a lot teams from iGEM contact us to ask us to send them it. We had not updated it since its creation, but since others continue to use it, we decided that this year we would work on updating it and making sure it can be a more effective teaching tool. We had the particular aim of making the curriculum a good resource for both other iGEM teams, synthetic biologists, and teachers. For more information, click here.
