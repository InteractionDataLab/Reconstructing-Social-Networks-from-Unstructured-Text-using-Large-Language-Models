When asked &quot;&quot;which plant breeding technique they think is the best and the worse from a nutritional, health and economical point of view?&quot;&quot; 44.3% of those surveyed chose artificial selection as the best technique and 23.5% of those surveyed chose genetic editing as the best technique. 68.7% of those surveyed chose induced mutagenesis as the worst technique. 3.5% of those surveyed chose genetic editing as the worst technique.

Those surveyed believed that genome editing was widely used, but a significant number did not feel that they knew what genome editing was. On the whole, plant genome editing was not seen as unfavorable, and is altogether seen as more favorable than &quot;&quot;transgenics&quot;&quot;. Of those surveyed, many knew about transgenics, but only about half knew the difference between transgenics and genome editing. This indicated that new technology needs to be actively communicated to society.
