Besides giving an outline of the iGEM project, discuss two findings that were encountered many times over during research for Synenergene: the problem of low oil prices and inconsistent government policy
Argue that low oil prices prohibit the full transition to a bio-based economy, and that biotechnology in and of itself is unlikely to ever match the costs of pumping oil out of the ground in terms of cost-effectiveness unless the peripheral costs of burning fossil fuels are properly taken into account
In a room full of policy makers, bring up the issue of inconsistent government policy pertaining to how the Dutch government has the tendency to change policy regarding biotech subsidization and legislation every two years

Individuals then glue their plasmids onto a paper template representing a wild type E. coli, while team members explain the methods of transforming host cells in the lab
Gene expression is represented through a ‘phenotypic change’ that is demonstrated by overlaying the wild type E. coli with a colored paper cutout with respect to their gene of choice

Meet with stakeholders; IVIA (Valencian Institute of Agrarian Researches), Intersemillas (national seedbed company), and Babyplant (local seedbed company) to gain feedback about whether ""HYPE-IT"" would be a useful tool, and to gain information about how to focus the project for maximal usefulness
",IHP,"IVIA was impressed by the CRISPR/Cas9 plant breeding technique, and noted that they used transgenics for research purposes, but not for developing new varieties, though that would change if the EU approved CRISPR/Cas9 edited plants for consumption.

Of the techniques surveyed, hybridization and artificial selection were the most widely known, while polyploidy and induced mutagenesis where the least. Of those surveyed 33.9% believed that induced mutagenesis is a commonly used technique. When asked ""which plant breeding technique they think is the best and the worse from a nutritional, health and economical point of view?"" 44.3% of those surveyed chose artificial selection as the best technique and 23.5% of those surveyed chose genetic editing as the best technique. 68.7% of those surveyed chose induced mutagenesis as the worst technique. 3.5% of those surveyed chose genetic editing as the worst technique.

On the whole, plant genome editing was not seen as unfavorable, and is altogether seen as more favorable than ""transgenics"". Of those surveyed, many knew about transgenics, but only about half knew the difference between transgenics and genome editing.
