Project
HEKcite
Inspired by the heart and its rhythm, our team sought to aid those who need continuous drug monitoring. To achieve this goal, we transformed ourselves into real dance instructors as we introduced a continuous rhythm in HEK cells. Our cells performed wonderfully so we are very proud to present you: HEKcite!

Team
The story of our team starts with four bioscience engineering students who were eager to expand their knowledge and learn vital practical skills. Almost one year later they were joined by nine motivated students and so the final 2017 KULeuven iGEM team was formed. A vast amount of meetings were followed by the actual lab work in the summer, but hard work was always varied with fantastic teambuilding activities. The great camaraderie is formed.

KU LEUVEN
Located just 30 kilometers from Brussels lies the educational beating heart of Belgium, the city of Leuven. It is home to the KULeuven, one of the oldest universities in Europe. Allow us to tell you some fun facts about Leuven.
Fact number 1: Did you know that Leuven is famously home to the biggest bar in the world?
Fact number 2: Around one third of the population of Leuven is a student at the university or works there. During summer, the streets of Leuven do indeed look emptier.
Fact number 3: Every year in October there is a major sports event where the different student societies battle it out on the racing track. The society that ran the most of laps after 24 hours wins this prestigious competition.

Education
Developing a card game that teaches you more about the immune system and its enemies, teaching children and young adults about biology and the importance of synthetic biology, doing fun experiments with children attending the childrenâ€™s university event... Our team did all this and more to make sure that we left a positive impact on the next generation. Want to know more about our education project, click here
