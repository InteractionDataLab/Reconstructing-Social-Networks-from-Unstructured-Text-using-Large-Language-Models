Human Practices Overview
Participating in iGEM was an amazing experience, but we did not only join igem just for fun: We also wanted to make sure that our project had societal relevance. Therefore, we discussed our project with people that would actually come into contact with our product: Doctors and patients dealing with various diseases.
Furthermore, we paid a lot of attention on sharing our enthusiasm for science with the world, and spreading information about synthetic biology. Interested in what else we did? Then continue reading!
