Safety
As safety is a very important aspect of sciences, we wanted to create a professor who could alert us whenever we did something dangerous. After following a recipe, which contained sugar, spice, everything nice and chemical X, Hekky arose from our experiment! But in contrary to what we wanted, Hekky came out as an inexperienced lab buddy to which we had to list up all the rules in order to keep him alive. Please read the following rules down below carefully and help us protect our sweet summer child!
