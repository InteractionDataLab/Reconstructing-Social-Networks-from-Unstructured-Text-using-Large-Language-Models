Ben Glick, a cell biologist and experienced cloner, realized that a huge amount of effort is wasted because researchers make avoidable mistakes when planning their cloning procedures, and because records of cloning procedures are incomplete. In the 21st century, many molecular biologists still don't know the full properties of the DNA molecules they are using. This problem has a solution: good software. If molecular biology software were easier to use than pen and paper, researchers would naturally plan their cloning procedures with computers, and electronic records could be automatically produced. To achieve this goal, a group of scientists, software engineers, usability experts, and product developers assembled to form GSL Biotech.</P><H2>Leuven MindGate</H2><P style="text-align:justify; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">Leuven MindGate was founded in 2016 when 29 leading knowledge institutions, companies and the city of Leuven joined forces.
