Day 1
Add 25µL of bacteria to the bottom of a polypropylene 14mL Falcon tube (352059). Place on ice.
Add either 0.5µL of 100ng/µL plasmid or 1 to 5µL of a ligation mix to the bacteria. Mix gently by shaking. Leave on ice for 30 minutes
Preheat the SOC medium and waterbath to 42ºC.
Perform a heat shock. Place cells at 42ºC for 30 to 45 seconds. Return to ice for 2 minutes.
Add 0.5mL SOC medium.
Place in shaking incubator at 37ºC for 1 hour.
Plate and spread on plates containing 50µg/mL of a specific antibiotic resistance markers. Incubate overnight at 37ºC for maximum 16 hours.
Day 2
Add 3mL of LB medium containing 50µg/mL of a specific antibiotic resistance marker to a 14mL polystyrene Falcon tube (352057).
Pick a single colony using a Inoculation loop. Transfer colony into medium and shake. In order to perform a miniprep, grow at 37ºC overnight and skip to 'Day 3'. Otherwise, grow for 3 to 4 hours and continue.
Add 70mL LB medium containing 50µg/mL of a specific antibiotic resistance marker to a sterile erlenmeyer.
Add the bacteria to the new medium: ½ of the medium in the Falcon if the growth is visible, all of the medium if the solution is still clear.
Place erlenmeyers in shaking incubator at 37ºC overnight or for maximum 16 hours.
Day 3
Harvest plasmids using mini-, midi- or maxiprep kit.

Patch Clamp
Methods
We used whole-cell patch clamp to measure the membrane voltage and ion currents across a HEK cell membrane. To measure whole-cell, we pushed a glass pipette against the  membrane of a cell, to seal the membrane completely against the membrane. Afterwards, we caused a sudden negative pressure in the glass pipette, which destroys the membrane in the opening of the glass pipette. The solution within the pipette will subsequentially mix with the intracellular compartment of the cell, which allows us to measure with a pre-defined intracellular buffer.
Voltage clamp
To study the currents through different ion channels with whole-cell patch clamp, we used a specific technique called "Voltage clamp". Here, we maintain a pre-defined membrane potential to study the activation of α1G, HCN2 and hERG. Each of these ion channels has a specific way of activation, which can be quantified using voltage clamp. When clamping the voltage at a certain value, a cell will adapt to the voltage by increasing or decreasing ion currents. These currents will be measured using this technique
Current clamp
When trying to measure an oscillation in the cell membrane with patch-clamp, you cannot use voltage-clamp, since this technique doesn't allow the cell to change its membrane potential. We used current-clamp instead. Here, you can inject a pre-defined current into the cell which allows you to see how the membrane potential of the cell responds to the current. When a cell oscillates by itself, the membrane potential will oscillate while injecting 0 current. However, we often needed to inject a small negative current (-300pA) into a cell to elicit an oscillation in a cell with an extracellular Krebs solution.
Calcium imaging
Calcium imaging is a scientific technique which can be used to measure and follow the calcium ions inside and/or outside the cell. We used a specific dye (Fura2-AM) to follow the calcium ions by the rate of fluorescence. For our project, we only used the calcium imaging for testing whether there were oscillations or not and what potassium concentrations (in a krebs buffer) were needed. We did not mathematically analyse the data we received. We only used it as a criteria for the patch clamp.
Preparation of imaging
Fura-2, AM (MW: 1001,9)
Dilute 50 μg of Fura-2 in 50 μl DMSO (1 mM stock solution)

To load cells (1 well): add 2 μl of Fura-2 to 1 ml of medium (2μM work solution)
Incubate cells for 30 minutes before measurement

The Na+ and K+ concentration is always 155 mM and when we made another buffer with another K +-concentration, the Na + concentration changes with it. The other components remained the same. (The most useful K + concentration is between 1 and 5 mM.)
