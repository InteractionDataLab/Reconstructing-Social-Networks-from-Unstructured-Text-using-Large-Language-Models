We received lots of encouraging words from many people but there is a difference between words and deeds, here we want to thank those who made some time and took the effort to help us. These people deserve to be in the spotlight because without them this project could have looked completely different, with their expertise and knowledge they showed many directions we could go in. But we don’t only want to thank the people who were actively helping, we also want to thank our family and friends. They supported us all the way and helped us through the difficult moments. So from the bottom of our hearts, thank you!</P></DIV><DIV class="container"><H2>Attributions</H2><P style="text-align:justify; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">We thank all our collaborators for their help, guidance and supervision. Without their help we wouldn’t be able to finish this project. Thanks to all the different people below we were able to create and finish our outstanding journey of 3 months, there were lots of ups and downs but we managed to push through. We started in July and during the months of July, August and September we proved that our concept is valid. The whole concept of sensing concentration differences with electrically oscillating cells started from an idea of one of our team members and ended up as finished proof of concept. We managed to create cells that electrically oscillate with a constant rhythm, with transient transfection of ion channels in HEK cells, and managed to alter this rhythm by adding different drugs, used in medicine, at the correct therapeutic concentrations to the cells. This shows that the cells can sense a change of concentration of the drugs and we can measure it. To see what we have accomplished please check our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Demonstrate">demonstrate page</A>. We didn’t only focus on the experimental work, we developed an amazing <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/Model">model</A> and created an <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/HP/Education">educational</A> journey for kids and young adults. Besides all this we are proud to present our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:KU_Leuven/HP/HP_Main">human practices</A> work. </P><H2>General Support</H2><P style="text-align:justify; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">As our first PI, professor Johan Swinnen and his team (Gertjan Werelds in particular), if we needed them they helped us with the small daily tasks. Kasia Malczewska and the rest of the KU Leuven 2015 iGEM team gave us advice and tips on how to work during the summer and passed their experiences to us.</P><H2>Project Support</H2><P style="text-align:justify; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">During brainstorm sessions several professors attended and gave their opinion on the ideas so we would like to thank professor Steven Verhelst, professor Rik Gijsbers, professor Geert Bulthynck, professor Joost Schymkowitz, professor Johan Robben, professor Jeroen Lammertyn, professor Vera Van Noort and professor Johan Swinnen for this.</P><H2>Molecular lab work</H2><P style="text-align:justify; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">Professor Johan Swinnen is a professor and head of the Oncology department at KU Leuven.

                            Professor Wim Van Paesschen is a neurosurgeon and head of the epilepsy research laboratory of UZ Leuven. He has shed light on the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring in the field of epileptics.
                            
                            We talked to professor Peter Sinnaeve, a specialist in the field of cardiology, about the implementation of our idea in the treatment of heart diseases. Thanks to his expert opinion we were able to determine what the needs in the field of cardiology are and if our project could benefit patients with heart diseases. The most important information he gave us was the need for a method to check if a certain drug would have an effect on the human heart. 
                            Professor Chris Bervoets is a psychiatrist responsible for the department of transcranial magnetic stimulation, the department of deep brain stimulation and the department of compulsive disorders within the University Psychiatric Center of KU Leuven. He has helped us by discussing the several possibilities of our project within the field of psychiatry. As professor Chris Bervoets, professor Filip Bouckaert is an expert in the field of psychiatry. He focused on the fact that anti-psychotics need to be present in a specific continuous amount in the human body to have the best effects. He was very enthusiastic about the possibilities of our product which allows an continuous measurement of that specific type of drug. He led us in the direction of some important and frequently used drugs in psychiatry.</P><H2>Education</H2><P style="text-align:justify; padding: 0px 50px 0px 50px;">We would like to thank some middle schools: Sint-Romboutscollege (Mechelen), Go Shill (Mechelen), Via Tienen (Tienen), Onze Lieve Vrouw Presentatie (Sint-Niklaas), Atheneum Tienen (Tienen) and Heilige-drievuldigheidscollege (Leuven).
