Notebook
You know what we did last summer! Do you want to know how the KU Leuven team filled their summer? In this Notebook you are able to follow what we did and when we did it. We documented every meeting, every sponsor meeting, every patient interview, every educational project and many more! Thanks to this Notebook you can travel back in time and see how we organized our summer and managed to get big things done in such a small time frame. Feel free to go through our notebook from the start to the finalization of the project with the Wiki Freeze. Once you get to know the past, you learn to appreciate the present day and the hard work done by this team.
