Design
The studying  of our model resulted in the discovery of three ion channels suited for our project. More information on these ion channels is mentioned below. The next step was measuring the rhythm of our transfected cells as well as the influence certain drugs have on this rhythm. With the results from the Patch Clamp showing indeed a change in frequency of the rhythm, the team started looking at the future. We started brainstorming about the theoretical design of our device. Further research brought the encapsulation method to light. The measurement of the rhythm in the human body would be done through a Multi-Electrode Array (MEA), as suggested by the nanotech company IMEC. More information about the in-vivo concept can be found below.

A voltage-sensitive calcium channel:
The
fast
voltage-sensitive
calcium
channel,
α
1G,
is
activated
by
depolarizations
that
reach
a
threshold
of
-65
mV.
As
a
result,
there
is
a
rapid
influx
of
calcium
ions
which
will
depola
-
rize
the
membrane
even
further,
until
all
the
ionchannels
deactivate
after
a
couple
of
mil
-
liseconds.
The
channels
will
reactivate
when
repolarizing
under
the
activation
threshold,
preparing
itself
for
the
next
cycle.
A voltage-sensitive potassium channel:
The
voltage-sensitive
potassium
channel,
hERG,
is
activated
by
a
slightly
more
positive
threshold
than
α1G.
Because
of
that,
there
is
an
efflux
of
potassium
ions,
which
causes
the
membrane
potential
to
drop
again.
The
activation
speed
is
slower
than
α1G,
that
is
why
the
membrane
potential
rises
first
due
to
α
1G,
followed
by
steep
decline
mediated
by
hERG
after
a
couple
of
millise
-
conds.
A slower voltage-sensitive sodium channel:
HCN2
is
peculiar,
it
becomes
activated
at
a
potential
below
-40
mV.
The
more
negative
the
membrane
potential
gets,
the
bigger
the
ion
flow
which
causes
a
steady
depolarization.
In
theory,
you
could
design
a
spiking
cell
which
contains
three
channels
such
as
α1G,
hERG
and
HCN.
We
hypothesize
however,
that
you
need
at
least
one
ion
channel
of
the
HCN
type
to
create
a
stable rhythm.
Ethosuximide
Ethosuximide
is
a
common
anti-epileptic
drug
that
reduces
the
amount
of
seizures
in
epilepsy
patients.
It
is
known
that
ethosuximide
blocks
the
T-type
calcium
channels
of
thalamic
neurons
in
a
voltage-dependent
way
and
thereby
reduces
the
calcium
current.
This
current
is
of
great
importance
for
several
cellular
processes
such
as
muscle
contraction,
hormone
or
neurotransmitter
release,
gene
ex
-
pression,
cell
motility,
cell
division
and
cell
death.
In
the
specific
case
of
epilepsy,
seizures
originate
because
of
synchronized
neuronal
ac
-
tivity
in
the
thalamic
nerves.
Blockage
of
the
T-type
calcium
channels
inhibits
depolarization
which
will
decrease
the
amount
of
synchronized
neuronal
activity
and
reduce
the
risk of initiating seizures.
Ivabradine
is
a
drug
commonly
used
for
the
symptomatic
management
of
heart-related
chest
pain,
also
called
stable
angina
pectoris,
and
heart
failure
not
fully
managed
by
beta
blockers.
It
is
the
first
specific
heart-rate
lowering
agent.
This
reduces
the
cardiac
load
which
prevents
ischemia
of
the
heart
muscle.
Ivabradine
is
a
specific
blocker
of
the
HCN
channel
and
thereby
lowers
the
funny
current
in
the
sinoatrial
node.
This
results
in
a
slower
depolarization
of
the
node
cells
without
affecting
the
duration
of
the
action
potential
which
leads
to
a
slower
heart
rate
and
no
reduction
in
heart
contractility.
Ivabradine
blocks
the
HCN
channel
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
by
entering
the
channel
pore
from
the
intracellular side.
Cyclosporin
is
an
immunosuppressant
commonly
used
to
prevent
organ
transplant
rejection
or
to
treat
several
autoimmune
diseases.
Cyclosporin
mediates
its
effect
by
binding
to
an
intracellular
receptor
cyclophilin,
the
formed
complex
inhibits
calcineurin,
a
Ca
2+
calmodulin-dependent
phosphatase
2B.
By
inhibiting
calcineurin
cyclosporine
prevents
calcineurin-dependent
interleukin-2
transcription
and
T-cell
activation
and
thus
causes
immunosuppression.
Next
to
this
mode
of
action,
it
is
also
proven
that
cyclosporin
affects
several
ion
channels.
First
of
all,
an
inhibition
of
voltage-gated
Ca2+
channels
in
hippocampal
neurons
was
reported.
Secondly,
cyclosporine
also
inhibits
voltage-gated
K+
channels
in
human
lymphocytes.
Not
only
voltage-gated
K+
channels
are
inhibited
but
also
hERG
channels
expressed
in
a
HEK293
cell
line
are
inhibited
by
cyclosporin.
This
does
not
directly
indicate
cardiotoxicity
since
HEK293
cells
have
a
different
phospholipid
composition,
the
inhibitory
effect
observed
can
be
different
in
cardiomyocytes.
This
means
that
blockade
of
hERG
in
HEK293
cells
does
not
imply
that
cyclosporine
causes
QT
elongation
and
possible
Torsades
de
Pointes
syndrome.

MEASURING THE EFFECT
Patch Clamp
Whole-cell patch clamp is an electrophysiological technique to study ionic currents by measuring membrane potential directly on single-cell level. More specific: it allows you to measure the electrical current or voltage differences across the membrane of a single cell. In our HEKcite project, we aimed to create stably oscillating HEK cells, by transfecting three key ion channels. Afterwards we wanted to influence this rhythm by adding drugs. Thus, it is crucial for our project to study our ion channels in the most precise manner.
Multi-Electrode Array2
A multi-microelectrode array is a device that measures electrical activity in cells, usually neurons. It is a transducer converting the voltage induced by ionic currents through the cell membrane to a current due to the movement of electrons. The MEA that was used for the experiments with the HEK cells can measure both extra- and intracellularly.
Dimensions of multi-electrode array
The array is based on CMOS technology. A wide range of MEAs are commercially available, ranging from a few electrodes to several thousands. One of the most important advantages of MEAs is the possibility to stimulate and record each electrode separately. Sometimes amplification is already included in the chip, as is the case for the one from IMEC. The MEA chip is mounted on a printed circuit board and has a small glass chamber on top where the cells go. The intracellular measurement is made possible by the MEA’s option to create nanopores in the cell’s membrane by applying voltage pulses. These holes are so small, they hardly affect the cell’s survival chance and the cell membrane repairs itself quickly. For measurement with the MEA, the peaks of the membrane potential of the cells need to be sharp/steep enough. This has to be verified before measuring. The output of the MEA is an analog signal.
IN VIVO CONCEPT 3,4,9
In order to use cells with an oscillating membrane potential as a means of continuous drug monitoring in the blood, a method needed to be established via which the cells could efficiently and safely be employed in a medical context. We first performed a preliminary investigation, during which various strategies were explored and evaluated for their potential clinical applicability.
To successfully measure the concentration of different drugs in the blood, the HEKcite cells have to be in perpetual contact with the bloodstream. As one might expect, simply injecting these cells was ruled out quite early in the evaluation process, as this would be both dangerous to the patient and would generate a situation in which it would be an absurdly difficult (if not impossible) task to measure the membrane potential of the circulating cells.
Further downstream the screening process, we stumbled upon the cell encapsulation technique. This method not only seemed promising for our project, but was already being investigated by multiple research groups for potential future applications. Furthermore, we were able to schedule appointments with two different experts willing to advance our understanding of in vitro encapsulation of living cells.
Before these meetings, we assessed the possible dangers and implications regarding capsules. This exploratory analysis revealed a list of primary risk factors associated with capsule implantation. This list includes (but is not limited to): Possible viral infections, risk of thrombosis, DNA leakage out of the capsule, and an immune response against the foreign material. Bernard Schneider, a senior scientist in the neurodegenerative studies laboratory in the university of Lausanne, was able to provide us with a list of answers to various questions like the ones listed above.
Type of cell
First of all, we made an inquiry about the type of cells we would use. HEK 293 cells, like the ones we created a sinus rhythm in, are known to have a high growth rate. This would result in the cells completely filling the capsule, which would cause them to starve and die. Furthermore, they contain adenoviral DNA, which makes them unacceptable for entering the human body. These two factors reduce the applicability of our HEK cells strictly to this proof of concept study. For this reason, we started looking for other cells.
As noted by professor Cosson, the key decision criteria for choosing new cells are: (1) the ease with which they are engineered, (2) the ability to store them in vitro in large batches, (3) the ease to be cultured in cheap media, and finally, (4) the cells need to be in biosafety category 1 to comply with regulation. Two cell types that meet these requirements, human myoblasts and ARPE-19 cells, were investigated to be used in the finalized capsule.
Specifics of chip in capsule
Secondly, we asked professor Schneider about the possibility of a chip in a capsule, and whether drugs could enter it through the bloodstream. The answer was that, in principle, these should both be possible. The implant itself could be quite simple, as it could simply be an empty space that can be filled with a gel and cells. Electrodes, used for the continuous measurements of the changing membrane potential, could be introduced, with the cells being measured on an electrode array. As noted by Schneider however, one should keep in mind that the cells need oxygen and nutrients. Thus, when a chip is inserted, the exchange surface should be large enough to accommodate for the number of cells in the capsule.
The implantable device we eventually aim to create consists of several parts. First and foremost, there is the multi-microelectrode array (MEA) for which we collaborated with IMEC, a leading research center in micro- and nanoelectronics. The output of this chip still needs amplification, filtering and conversion from analog to digital. This all will be included in a second chip. This second chip will also include Bluetooth to send the signal to for example a bracelet the patient is wearing, and components for power supply. The cells and the electronics are then encapsulated by two membranes. The purpose of these membranes is to keep the cells from escaping while letting nutrients and the medication to be measured in. All of these components will now be discussed in more detail.
The signal processing of the MEA output includes amplification of the signal, filtering and DC to AC conversion. This can all be included in one integrated circuit. There are some companies on the market that produce these, Intan being one example. The output of this chip is digital.
Membranes 11
An obvious design parameter for the capsules is the biocompatibility of the membranes to minimize host response. To help us decide on a suitable material we spoke to prof. Patterson of the department of Materials Engineering. Together we decided on the following specifications of the membrane: the material should be inert, non-degradable, cheap and of course biocompatible. Taking all this into account we landed on Polypropylene (PP). This polymer is a well-known biocompatible material which is commercially available. Because of its use in multiple applications it is well characterized. It is also relatively non-degradable and inert. The two membranes that encapsulate the chips and cells should be adhered to each other with welding techniques, since glues don’t tend to hold on PP. To manufacture the membranes in the desired shape, injection molding could be used. A hydrogel to grow the cells on, is not needed since the device only needs a sheet shaped 2D layer of cells. It could however be useful to place between the cells and the membranes to keep everything in place. A commonly used hydrogel that could be used is Polyethylene Glycol (PEG). Since PP is commercially available, the membranes could just be ordered and not custom made and designed, which reduces cost.
Entry of drugs and nutrients into the device 13
Regarding the entry of drugs into the device, the answer lies within neovascularization, according to Schneider. The formation of new blood vessels and their subsequent contact with the membrane should allow tight contact between blood and device. To establish whether a specific molecule can enter the capsule however, the structure of the semipermeable membrane and the size of its pores are determinant. Before commercial application of such an apparatus, these parameters should first be assessed.
Schematic representation of flow over encapsulated cells
While entry of drugs is an important parameter, the possible leakage of DNA out of the capsule is another. It has, however, been proved in multiple clinical trials, that the amount of DNA released from capsules is negligible. Professor Schneider (and we agree on this) thus believes the use of such capsules as ethically acceptable.   Of course, what good is putting cells in a device if they don't survive. A number of mathematical tools and expressions are available to calculate if cells will receive enough nutrients. The example of oxygen is shown in the following paragraphs.
Advection
One of the ways oxygen will reach the cells is through advection in the blood. The following equation accounts for this phenomenon.\[\frac{\partial C_{O_2}}{\partial t}=-\nabla V-V\nabla C_{O_2}\]                             If the liquid is incompressible, we can assume that \[\nabla V=0\]                             Blood however is slightly compressible, but for simplicity we can make this approximation. We can do this because the Mach number is very small and the blood can be said to behave as incompressible. \[Ma=\frac{V}{C}=\frac{1\rightarrow100 ^{cm}/_s}{1540 ^m/_s}\]                              Hence, we can state that \[\frac{\nabla C_{O_2}}{\nabla t}=-V\nabla C_{O_2}\]
Navier-Stokes
For describing the motion of the blood, we use Newton's second law. For fluids this comes down to applying the Navier-Stokes equations. Navier-Stokes can be used only for Newtonian fluids. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid which means we again have to make an approximation.
\[\rho\displaystyle(\frac{\nabla V}{\nabla t}+v\nabla v)=\underbrace{-\nabla p}_\text{forces due to pressure differences}+\underbrace{\mu\nabla^2v}_\text{forces due to viscosity}+\underbrace{f}_\text{body force}\]                             The left hand side is equal to zero since the blood has a constant velocity on average. This means that the Navier-Stokes equation can be simplified to \[\nabla p=\mu\nabla^2v+f\] Note that a pressure gradient is needed as a driving force for the motion of the blood.
Blood through membrane: Darcy
Since the membrane is a semi-permeable and thus porous, the flow of the blood through it can be describes by Darcy’s law, which can be derived from Navier-Stokes:                             \[Av=-\kappa(\nabla p-fg)\]                              with A, the cross-sectional area of the pores, equal to around 0,45 μm for polypropylene,                              g=9,81 N/kg and κ the permeability to oxygen of polypropylene.
Diffusion: Fick
Besides active flow through the membrane, there’s also diffusion. This process can be described by Fick’s law of diffusion:                             \[\frac{\nabla C_{O_2}}{\nabla t}=\nabla(D_{O_2}\nabla C_{O_2})\]                             We can approximately say the diffusion coefficient is homogeneous and thus the equation becomes \[\frac{\nabla C_{O_2}}{\nabla t}=D_{O_2}\nabla^2 C_{O_2})\]                             We assume steady state                              \[\implies C_{O_2}(x)=C_0+(C_1-C_0)\frac{x}{d}\]in which C0 is equal to the CO2 outside the membrane and C1 is the CO2 inside the membrane.
Total
When we combine all these equations, we get the following equations:                                \[\begin{cases}     \frac{\partial C_{O_2}}{\partial t}=D_{O_2}\nabla^2C_{O_2}-v\nabla C_{O_2}-\underbrace{QC_{cell}}_\text{consumption}\\     \frac{\partial C_{cell}}{\partial t}=\underbrace{AC_{cell}(1-\alpha C_{cell})}_\text{proliferation}-\underbrace{dC_{cell}}_\text{death}     \end{cases}\]                             If the oxygen consumption follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetic then      \[Q=\frac{C_{O_2}}{K_m+C_{O_2}}\]                             The death rate of the cells is a function of the oxygen concentration and can for example be described by the following equation:     \[d=f(C_{O_2})=1-\frac{C_{O_2}}{K_d+C_{O_2}}\]  A few more values are still needed to complete the calculation, such as the properties of the PP used and the consumption rate of the cells. If these are provided when the eventual device is developed, these equations allow to calculate if the cells will receive enough oxygen in the device to survive.
Risk of thrombosis
When implanting small capsules, one should always consider the risk of that device ending up in the bloodstream, and causing thrombosis. In our case, the macro-capsule would be relatively big (bigger than a 2€ coin in general). This makes it physically improbable that such a device could enter the blood stream and cause thrombosis.
Immune reaction
Last but not least, we inquired about possible dangers associated with immune responses against such an implanted device. When implanting a device (or something else that is considered ‘foreign’) into the human body, the typical reaction will be the foreign body response. To avoid going into great detail, the endpoint of this reaction is the formation of fibrous tissue that encapsulates the foreign body. Important to note, is that a low level of inflammation would help this kind of neovascularization (which is positive), but chronic inflammation caused by cellular hypoxia will cause an excess of fibrosis which will prevent oxygen and nutrients from entering the capsule.
