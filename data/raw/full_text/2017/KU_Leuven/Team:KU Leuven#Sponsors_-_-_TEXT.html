For this we want to express our deepest gratitude to every sponsor, especially VIB and our own university KU Leuven. Their input and support got our project rolling, who knows where this will stop?

SnapGene
SnapGene was born of frustration. Ben Glick, a cell biologist and experienced cloner, realized that a huge amount of effort is wasted because researchers make avoidable mistakes when planning their cloning procedures, and because records of cloning procedures are incomplete. In the 21st century, many molecular biologists still don't know the full properties of the DNA molecules they are using. This problem has a solution: good software. If molecular biology software were easier to use than pen and paper, researchers would naturally plan their cloning procedures with computers, and electronic records could be automatically produced. To achieve this goal, a group of scientists, software engineers, usability experts, and product developers assembled to form GSL Biotech.
Leuven MindGate
Leuven MindGate was founded in 2016 when 29 leading knowledge institutions, companies and the city of Leuven joined forces. These three parties represent the Leuven ecosystem in a so-called Triple Helix model.
Companies: Cooperate with the government and knowledge institutions and create economic development, growth and jobs.
Government: Invests in education to create a knowledgeable workforce, in infrastructure to create an ideal entrepreneurial climate and simplifies laws so local business can grow.
Knowledge institutions: Develop talent and knowledge for the future and encourage innovation through cooperation and the creation of spin-off companies.
When Leuven MindGate was created, two clear goals were determined for the benefit of the whole region of Leuven.
1) Position the Leuven region internationally as a top destination in Health, High-Tech and Creativity: Leuven MindGate participates in national and international projects, missions, trade fairs and constantly aims to make Leuven MindGate worldwide top of mind when it comes to health, high-tech and creativity.
2) Strengthen the region's eco(n)system for the benefit of local companies:           Leuven MindGate improves cross-pollination between these sectors by letting them interact, cooperate and co-create. This creates a unique ecosystem and perfect breeding ground for companies, entrepreneurs, investors and international talent.
