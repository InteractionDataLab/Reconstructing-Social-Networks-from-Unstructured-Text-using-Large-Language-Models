Not in the sense that he's the strong silent type, but more in the sense that he's tall and has the personality of a tree.   Talking to Greg, it becomes clear that he knows a lot about biology- specifically a lot about what it's like being a tree.  Greg's dad is an apple farmer, which means he plants trees. In a way, you could say that Greg has more than just the two human siblings he has. He also has hundreds of fellow trees.

Records have suggested that Sneha is worshipped by members of the tribe, for witnessing Sneha is believed to imbue an individual with kindness, strength, and insight. Sneha is also sometimes known as ‚ÄúPolicy and Practices Lead‚Äù among its people, reflecting her keystone presence in allowing Cornell iGEM to thrive.Habitat:Sneha exhibits unique migratory patterns, spending disproportionately lengthy periods of the year in the middle of nowhere to develop the next paradigm in cancer treatment as a chemical engineer. Occasionally, she retreats to the lush fields of New Jersey to recuperate from the cursed basement of Weill Hall, where incompatible restriction sites will ligate. Rumors have also claimed that Sneha can be seen in the forsaken halls of Baker Laboratory at 4 am, simultaneously studying for linear algebra, organic chemistry, and statistical mechanics, with a grace and ferocity that inspires awe and admiration.Characteristics and Behaviors:Sneha is characterized by a 72-hour circadian rhythm, rendering her capable of juggling 50 credits of coursework, handling two project teams, and having personal conversations with struggling friends until 3 in the morning. This is attributed to a unique metabolic pathway whereby caffeine is directly converted to ATP. In addition, as a master of all disciplines, Sneha once trained elementary school children to become experts biochemical engineering, many of whom have become important figures in the booming biotech industry of Silicon Valley.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row bio-wrapper"><DIV class="col-md-8 bio-info-wrapper right"><DIV class="bio-title">Amanda Ong - Wiki &amp; Design Lead</DIV><DIV class="bio-subtitle">Information Science, Systems, and Technology '19</DIV><DIV class="bio-body">Don't let Amanda's size fool you.

Some rumor he might have magical skills with what he can pull through in lab, and he has memorized no less than a million different molecular biology spells. His abilities are so great, that he has in the past been credited of lifiting the curse placed on the iGEM lab this past summer. Beyond his charms and brilliance though, he is more than willing to use his powers to help out any of the iGEM members, as he is no doubt an amazing friend. In a few years, Yi Fan will probably be on Forbes 30 Under 30 for science and simultaeneously winning the Noble Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Want to learn more about this famed, mystical figure? Lure him out of Weill with a bubble tea. You will be inspired by what you learn. Also, side note: don't cross him, he knows Akido and could probably kick your ass.
