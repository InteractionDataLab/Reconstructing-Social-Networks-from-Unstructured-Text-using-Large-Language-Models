As a team of only undergraduates, we conceived this concept on our own and have worked on it from start to finish.  Our wet lab team cloned the redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins, ROS scavengers, and light-sensitive promoters and other redox-related proteins into pSB1C3.  The team also tested the pDawn and pDusk system and characterized the redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins coupled with the ROS scavengers. Dry lab designed, 3D printed, and prototyped the camera system with the plastic planter cups filled with wet lab’s bacteria using materials and funding from Rev and Cornell’s College of Engineering. The team also tested our project in Cornell greenhouses and PureSpinach’s own plants. Policies and practices led and organized the numerous outreach programs directed to the youth and the wider public. The team met with and reached out to a diverse array of researchers, and hydroponics growers for ideation and implementation of our project. To understand how the the project fit into society, the team conducted surveys and met with lawmakers and educators.
Cornell iGEM’s OxyPonics would not have been possible without the guidance and support of our many advisors and organizations that we have worked with:
Our wet lab research was conducted in the Cornell Biomedical Instructional lab directed by Dr. Shivaun Archer. Dr. Archer provided us with all the necessary equipments including a gel imaging station, sterile hood, centrifuges, thermal-cyclers, and vortexes. She also oversaw lab safety and trained new members on lab safety measures.
Dr. Jan Lammerding for advising our team and letting us use facilities in his lab for protein purification.
Brian Bauer, Ken Rother, and Xanthe Matychak at Rev for funding OxyPonics and offering their space and mentorship at every step of the project.
AmHydro, Bolton Farms, Vertical Harvest, Terrapin Farms, Intergrow, Karma Farms, Red Acres Hydroponics for their time and willingness to meet with us to provide their insight and experience for our project.
Professors Neil Mattson, Adrienne Roeder, Yimon Aye, Miguel Pineros, Professor Paula Turkon, and Jed Sparks for providing their expertise in the myriad of fields necessary for the success of our project.
In addition, we would like to thank the following for their help and guidance:
Integrated DNA Technologies for the generous base pair donation.
All our interviewees who took the time to give us feedback on our project. Your opinions are crucial to designing our product.
Rebecca MacDonald for helping us with team organization and business relations, and Cornell’s College of Engineering for providing us the platform to participate in iGEM.
