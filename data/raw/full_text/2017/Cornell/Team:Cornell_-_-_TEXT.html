Synthetic biology meets
hydroponics.
We're a synthetic biology research team revolutionizing vertical farming.
Cornell iGEM believes in potential. Hydroponics will be the next agricultural paradigm to end food scarcity. Synthetic biology will be the paragon for solving problems on a global scale. We propose a novel platform that integrates basic biological processes with optical engineering to sense and optimize oxidative stress. Come dive in with us.
