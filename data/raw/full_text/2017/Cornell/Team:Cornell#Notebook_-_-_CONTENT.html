The team received important feedback from them, including their needs. One key theme we found in our interviews was a need for a simple, continuous, real-time monitoring system. Furthermore, they learned that there were several sources of abiotic stress, including excess heat, insects, humidity, and pH fluctuations. They also found that many hydroponic growers were open to testing new methods and technology. The group also reached out to the Rasheed Hislop Community Garden in New York City to consider the ramifications of placing genetically-engineered bacteria in such close proximity to people’s food. While it isn’t common, team members did find that some hydroponic growers, such as those at
            Terrapin Farms in Maryland, do use bacteria in their setup to provide benefits to crops.

Dr. Mattson discussed some of the specific disease problems that arise in hydroponic agriculture as well as the role of oxidative stress in those diseases. Members of product development and P&amp;P also spoke with more hydroponic growers, and they learned that disease can kill hydroponic crops extremely quickly. Many of the non-traditional growers, such as J.J. Reidy at Urban Pastoral, who uses an old shipping container for his setup, had similar complaints about energy usage and monitoring as the traditional hydroponic growers did. Another hydroponic farm, Urban Crop Solutions, told the team about its own use of oxidants such as ozone to sterilize the hydroponic solution.
