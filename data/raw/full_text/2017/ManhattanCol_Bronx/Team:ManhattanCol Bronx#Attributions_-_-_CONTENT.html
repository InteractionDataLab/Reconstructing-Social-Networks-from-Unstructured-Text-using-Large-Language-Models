The Manhattan College iGEM project was made possible by generous funding from the the School of Science and the Provost's Office. Specifically we would like to thank the Dean of Sciences, <B> Dr. Constantine Theodosiou </B>, provost <B> Dr. William Clyde </B>, <B> Dr. Rani Roy </B> and <B> Elly Mons </B>. Without their continued support our project would have never left the ground. The School of Science supported our team registration fee and the Jamboree registration for two students. The Provost's office also supported a portion of the Jamboree registration fees for an additional two students. We would also like to acknowledge the materials and equipment contributions from both the Wilkins Lab and the Santulli Lab of Manhattan College.

This project was conceptualization and designed by our team. Our faculty mentors helped us by teaching us new biological and nanoscience techniques. When our project encountered problems our mentors were available to help guide us through troubleshooting but the execution of the experiments were performed by the students on the team.

Farzana played a leading role in the synthesis of our nanowires. She also aided in building our expression plasmids, performing protein test expressions and building our biobricks. She was a major driving force behind this project.</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Brian Evans </B> (student leader) </H4><P> Brian played a leading role in the design and execution of this project. He is credited with the research background and helping determine our mutant enzymes. He played an extensive role in creating our expression plasmids, verifying ligation results, isolating our proteins and characterizing their activity. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Amanda Lazkani </B> (fundraising leader) </H4><P> Amanda has played a key role in organizing and managing our fundraising events for our iGEM team. She has also aided in the synthesis of our nanowires and other research aspects of the project. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Syeda Rithu</B> (wiki leader)</H4><P> Syeda has played a critical role in establishing our wiki page and being our IT administrator.  
</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Ashley Abid</B> (administrative leader) </H4><P> Ashley has been playing a critical role behind the scenes as a student advisor and administrator.

</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Dawud Abdur-Rashid </B></H4><P> Dawud has played a role in each of the research aspects of this project.  He helped create our expression plasmids, perform test expressions and initiate the digests for our biobricks.
</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Gregory Sanossian</B></H4><P> Gregory joined our team later than the other members and did not have much time to enter the lab for physical experiments. He has been contributing by taking a lead role in coordinating our Human Practices efforts. He also helped in the design of our project presentation and poster. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><H4><B>Samuel Corby </B></H4><P> Sam has played a role in various aspects of the project. He has focused mostly on helping build our biobricks.
