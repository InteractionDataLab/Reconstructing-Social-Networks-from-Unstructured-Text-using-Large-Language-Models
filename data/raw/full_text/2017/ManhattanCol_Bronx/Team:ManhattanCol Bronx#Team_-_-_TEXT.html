Undergraduate Team Members
Samuel Corby
Hometown- Cornwall, NY
Major- Mechanical Engineering
Favorite Hobby- I love to play instruments and experience music in as many ways as possible.
What does iGEM mean to you and what do you wish to get out of this whole experience- I aspire to become a better contributor towards the science community and grow as much as I can out of iGem.
Gregory Sanossian
Hometown- Garden City, NY
Major-Junior Pursuing a B.S. in Chemical Engineering
Favorite Hobby- Body building
What does iGEM mean to you and what do you wish to get out of this whole experience- Valuable research experience and broadening my scientific knowledge
Ashley Abid
Hometown-Queens, NY
Major- Currently pursuing Master's in Translational Medicine
Favorite Hobby- Drawing
What does iGEM mean to you and what do you wish to get out of this whole experience- Working in an iGEM team has been a wonderful opportunity for me to explore cutting-edge research in a field that combines both of my passions: technology and biology. I hope to increase my knowledge and understanding of the field of synthetic biology and to develop skills that I can build upon in the future.
Farzana Begum
Hometown- Bronx, NY
Major- Chemical Engineering
Favorite Hobby- Biking
What does iGEM mean to you and what do you wish to get out of this whole experience- From the iGem experience I hope to work in a team to learn about bio fuel cells, nanotechnology, and new lab techniques and skills. Through an international collaboration with other teams I hope to broaden my horizon on other topics in the field of synthetic biology being explored all over the world. Through outreach and education, explaining our project to other teams, teachers, and students of different age groups, I hope to be able to rethink the directions we could take with our project, to improve my presentation skills.
Amanda Lazkani
Hometown- Staten Island, NY
Major- Chemical Engineering
Favorite Hobby- Music
What does iGEM mean to you and what do you wish to get out of this whole experience- By joining the iGEM team, I hope to broaden my knowledge on synthetic biology and nanotechnology and get hands-on experience in this field by constantly working in the lab. This experience will allow me to collaborate with some of the biggest schools internationally, providing me with connections that will benefit my future, specifically my career. This project perfectly fits chemical engineering, further expanding my studies.
Brian Evans
Hometown- Dobbs Ferry, NY
Major- Biochemistry
Favorite Hobby- Fencing, Hiking, Chess, Anime/Manga
What does iGEM mean to you and what do you wish to get out of this whole experience- I hope to have fun and make new friends.  Through our work, I am sure I will learn new things about being creative and using synthetic biology to create exciting novel biological circuits.  I look forward to seeing how other teams use synthetic biology in their own projects.
