Hello! We're the Manhattan College iGEM Team!
We are undergrads with different backgrounds, but one common interest in the field of synthetic biology. We spent our summer working on making biological fuel cells more efficient at producing energy with the use of E. coli. Basically, we're making a BACTERY!
How to Produce Lots of
Electricity Using a Biological Fuel Cell?
Presented by Manhattan iGEM
Combining Biological Cells with Electricity
Our case is using Glucose Oxidase
Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid, by utilizing molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor with simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide.
Introduction
Synthetic biology utilizes concepts in engineering and mathematical modeling to design ways in which to genetically manipulate biological system in order to alter or create unique physiological pathways.  DNA serves as the functional units in the architecture of improved blueprints of existing organisms.
An enzymatic biofuel cell is a type of biochemical cell that uses catalysts, specifically enzymes, to oxidize its fuel, in this case, glucose.  In this project glucose oxidase from aspergillus niger is required at the anode, which is the cell in which oxidation occurs. The enzyme makes 24 electrons
