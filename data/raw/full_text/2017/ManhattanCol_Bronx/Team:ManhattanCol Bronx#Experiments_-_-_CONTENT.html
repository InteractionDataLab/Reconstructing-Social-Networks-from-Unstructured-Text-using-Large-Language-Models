</P><P align="justify"> Digestion of the gBlocks and plasmids were performed as follows:
<UL align="justify"><LI> 100-200 ng of gBlock DNA was digest in a total volume of 10-15 µl.

Digestions that produced 2 fragments (the size of vector and insert) verified that the ligation worked in those clones and the DNA was then sequenced. The cells that harbored the correct ligation products were then glycerol stocked and stored at -80C.

The pCDF plasmid utilizes a T7lac promoter that is IPTG inducible. This vector requires an E. coli expression host (DE3) containing a chromosomal copy of the gene for T7 RNA polymerase. We transformed BL21(DE3) cells with DNA from successful ligation reactions. The transformation protocol was the same as detailed above. Cells carrying the appropriate vector were then grow in LB medium, at 37C, supplemented with spectinomycin. From an overnight starter culture we inoculated a 500 ml culture for protein expression and purification:</P><UL align="justify"><LI> Cells were allowed to grow to an OD600 = 0.8-1.0.</LI><LI> IPTG was then added to a final concentration of ~ 400 uM.</LI><LI> Cells were then allowed to express protein for ~ 16 h.

The fractions that were taken at time points following IPTG induction were lysed by boiling 100 ul of cells (pelleted) in 100 ul SDS running buffer. The whole cell lysate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on a 15% gel. Separated proteins were blotted to PVDF membrane in Towbin buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol (pH 8.3)). The blotted proteins were decorated with anti-HIS primary antibody and then secondary antibody conjugated with HRP. We then visualized our proteins using ECL substrate. </P><P><FONT face="Tahoma" size="+1" color="#0B1907" line="" height="20px"><B>GOx purification:</B></FONT></P><P align="justify"> Our GOx expression lysates were passed over a 500 ul bed volume of BioRad, Profinity™ IMAC Resin, Ni-charged (#1560131), pre-equilibrated with PB buffer. The flow through was collected and the resin was washed with excess PB buffer. GOx was eluted using PB buffer supplemented with 250 uM imidazole. Elutions were performed as 5x 1 ml fractions. Each fraction was tested for presence of protein as well as the activity of GOx.</P><P><FONT face="Tahoma" size="+1" color="#0B1907" line="" height="20px"><B>GOx Enzymatic Activity Assay:</B></FONT></P><P align="justify"> GOx catalyzes the oxidation of D-glucose and produces hydrogen peroxide (H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>). We took advantage of the Invitrogen Molecular Probes Amplex® Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit (A22189) which allows for a one-step detection of glucose oxidase activity by coupling the production of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> to the activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> reacts with  Amplex® Red (a colorless molecule), in the presence of HRP, to yield resorufin (red-fluorescent product). This colorimetric assay directly couples the activity of glucose oxidase to the production of resorufin. </P><P align="justify"> We used the Amplex Red kit according to the manufactures <A href="https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp22189.pdf">protocol</A>. To 50 ul of the assay reaction mixture (PB buffer, HRP, glucose, and Amplex Red) we added 50 ul of our elution fractions. The kit provided Wt GOx which was used as the positive control (0.1 U/ml final working concentration). Our negative control was elution buffer only.</P><P align="justify"> We observe GOx activity from each of our tested constructs. The results are outlined on the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ManhattanCol_Bronx/Results">results page</A>. </P><P><FONT face="Tahoma" size="+3" color="#088A08">nANODE Synthesis</FONT></P><P align="justify"><FONT face="Tahoma" size="+1" color="#0B1907" line="" height="20px"> To create our nanowires, we used polycarbonate filter membranes (templates) with track etched pores with a diameter of 200 nm.  These templates were then sonicated in a bath sonicator in pure ethanol for approximately 10 seconds to fill the pores with ethanol.  Following the sonication step, the template is then mounted into a U-Tube reactor to separate the two half-cell compartments.  A picture of the assembled U-Tube is shown below. </FONT></P><P align="justify"> A 0.005 M solution of HAuCl<SUB>4</SUB> is used to fill one side of the U-Tube apparatus.  <B>Simultaneously</B> a 0.005 M solution of NaBH<SUB>4</SUB> is used to fill the other side.  It is critical to fill both sides at the same time and same rate to ensure that the delicate template is not broken.  Once filled, the U-Tube is left to react for a particular amount of time. The specific amount of time depends on several things, concentration of reactants, pore size, and temperature. </P><P> After allowing the reaction to occur, the solutions are carefully poured out of the U-Tube, the Au solution is saved for later use, while the NaBH<SUB>4</SUB> solution is discarded.  The U-tube apparatus is dismantled and the template is carefully removed and dried with a Kim-wipe.  A picture of the polycarbonate template after reaction is shown below.  The gold colored portion is where the reaction occurred within the pores. We are unsure at this point why the reaction did not occur evenly over the entire template, but the entire area should have a gold color. </P><P> To isolate the nanowires from the template for imaging in a Scanning Electron Microscope, first the excess Gold is removed from the surface of the template by grinding with a grinding stone.  The template is then placed into a centrifuge tube and dissolved using Methylene Chloride.  The AuNWs are then removed by centrifugation at 4000 RPM for 7 minutes, and the supernate is discarded.  This process is repeated 3 more times to ensure all of the polycarbonate has been removed.  At this point, the AuNWs are ready for characterization with an SEM or to be used in electrochemical experiments.  We have not had a chance to run any electrochemical experiments yet, unfortunately. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
