Collaborations
The Manhattan College iGEM team collaborated with the
Academy team in two ways ( West Point iGEM Wiki ).
Our team transformed DH5alpha cells with each of the devices for the InterLab study. We shared these strains with the West Point team in an effort to help them complete their Interlab study.
We are also collaborating through a joint meeting of iGEM teams. We visited West Point Academy and each team presented their Jamboree presentations. This collaboration was an effort to receive critical insight into our project
