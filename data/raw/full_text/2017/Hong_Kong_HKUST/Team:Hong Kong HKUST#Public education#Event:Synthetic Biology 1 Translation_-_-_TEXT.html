Aim
- To reach students in China whose native language is Mandarin and where Youtube is not accessible.
- To broadcast synthetic biology 1 to people whose mother tongue is Chinese.
Description
From the meeting with some high school students, we found that one issue is the medium of instruction. While Hong Kong is a place where English is the secondary language, students especially from public high school are taught in Chinese. Interesting sources for learning synthetic biology with Chinese as a medium of instruction is also limited.
At the same time, we encountered Mr. Ariel Lindner who introduced us Synthetic Biology 1 page and invited us to collaborate in Chinese translation with Mr. Edwin Wintermute. We would like to thank you Mr. Ariel Lindner, a founder of CRI, and Mr. Edwin Wintermute for this great opportunity.
Achievement
We translated subtitles and voice-over for four videos shared by Synthetic Biology 1. Our translated videos have been uploaded on bilibili website: https://space.bilibili.com/178821464/#!/
As synthetic biology 1 presents a diverge way of learning through interdisciplinary research, we hope that in the future we can share these videos through our facebook page once the translation is uploaded on Youtube. Bilibili is yet sharable on Youtube or Facebook. For further information about Synthetic Biology: https://syntheticbiology1.com
