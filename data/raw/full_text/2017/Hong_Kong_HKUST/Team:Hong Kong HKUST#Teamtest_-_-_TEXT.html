Our Team
Kin Yung CHAU, Ken
The original project designer in charge of our Sensing module.
Ken is a final year student who is very passionate about biology. He is known for being                             the "Cha-siu" (barbeque pork in chinese) of our lab as this is the way he says "I trust you".                             With all his trust for the team, we also call him a god who never gets angry.
Ka Wing YUEN, Gary
The original project designer in charge of our Recombination module.
As an experienced                             iGEM team player as this is Gary's second year joining iGEM, he always emphasizes on the importance                             of negative control, even when we held experiment workshops to primary school children in the                             HKSTP science fair.
Tak Sui LI, Max
The original project designer in charge of our Time Control module.
As a final year student and the oldest member in our team, Max is experienced with the laboratory                             procedure and precautions. He always reminds us of every precaution. Being one of the bosses,                             he cares for the precaution very much.
Handi YANG, Handi
The Mandarin translator in Human Practice.
Handi is a sweet girl working in the                             Recombination module. Using her skillful knowledge in Chinese and Biology, she made the production                             for the Chinese version of Synthetic Biology 1 videos a lot smoother.
Chen PENG, Harold
The perfectionist.
As one of the year one members in the team, Harold studies very                             hard for his knowledge in synthetic biology and on experimental design. As a perfectionist, he                             uses camera to keep track of what he has done and to modifying the experiments in the Recombination                             module.
Lok Man CHAN, Jenny
Our main artist.
Jenny not only draws the amazing pictures, but also creates numerous                             of iGEM memes to entertain us. She is very enthusiastic in the lab and project development, but                             sometimes you may find her falling asleep to recover her energy.
Wai Yan LO, Kapher
The automatic "laugh-generator".
Whenever Kapher is present, the lab will be full                             of laughter, she will yell "Yo! Let's goooo!!!" when our lab day begins. She is very responsible                             to keep track of lab works and is also engaged in the human practices activities. She loves to                             get in touch with children very much.
Alvin Riva KUSUMA, Alvin
The adventurer.
Alvin is one of the people you will see in the lab everyday. You                             can tell how committed he is to our project. Despite his love for messaging, he sometimes shares                             food with his E. coli pets when he wants to know how the double distilled water tastes                             like.
Sirinant KHUNAKORNBODINTR, Katie
The Promoter of our team.
Katie always reminds us to do work on time. She is very                             responsible not only for the Time Control Module and human practices, but also in other duties.                             She ensures that everyone completes their work to the best of their ability.
Ora-in CHU, Kelly
A secretary who needs faster typing skills.
Kelly is very committed that you can                             see her in the lab early in the morning working for our project. As a part of Time Control Module,                             she keeps track on the progress of the module as there were too many dishes.
Tsz Chun KWOK, Marco
The Poker-faced Comedian.
Being an introvert, Marco seldom speaks. However when                             he does, he always hits the nail on the head. He will never laugh to whatever jokes he makes,                             that is why he is so funny all the time! This personality made him got along with the kids and                             high school students very well.

The Snacks Secretary.
Yolanda is an extraordinary secretary who takes her job one                             step further by making sure we have enough snacks to survive in our daily work. She likes eating                             but always complains about eating too much.
Phoomraphee LUENAM, Phoom
The math and IT support center of the team.
The genius not only can model the whole                             construct but also can explain the complicated idea of the models clearly to every one of us.                             Perhaps he likes cat, he is nice to everyone in lab.
Vincentius Mario PURNAMA, Mario
The "Kekanak-kanakan" Foodie.
"Kekanak-kanakan" (means "childish" in Indonesian)                             is the only word Mario taught in Indonesian and we still cannot spell and pronounce it correctly.                             We named him this because he is always acting silly, especially in front of delicious food. (e.g. Ice-creams and Kit-Kat chocolates)
Marcel SANTOSO, Marcel
The Calmest member of the team.
Marcel is the best representative for the word                             "Santuirrrrrrrrrrrr" (a slang word for "calm down" in Indonesian), and also one of the first                             person who you will see in the lab everyday.
Belkis CHAU ZHONG, Belkis
The Presenter.
To polish her presentation skills, Belkis is always the kindest                             person who takes the initiative to present for the groups during general meetings.
Wun Kwan YAM, William
The "Radio Reporter" of the team.
With William's perfect tone in both English and                             Cantonese, he will always be chosen whenever we need a good voice (especially for the weekly                             presentations and voice-over for our "Synthetic biology 1" videos).
Yip Pan NGAN, Sheldon
The Funny Lecturer.
Sheldon is our greatest teacher available for public education                             on synthetic biology and biosafety. He can also keep the lab in a relaxed atmosphere by joking                             around.
Man Chun CHUI, Martin
Our Quiet Janitor.
Martin sets over 80% of pipettes back to the highest volume                             setting after everyday's lab work, and he's also the script writer for Cantonese version of Syn                             Bio videos

The Main Contact person for the human practice in our team.
David puts a lot of                             effort in the human practices group by organizing various events and activities for the public.                             He is a very sociable person who is not shy to contact people from other teams or the professionals.                             It is really a good thing to have him in the human practices group!
Our Advisors
Luna Eresta JAYA, Luna
The Good Teacher.
Luna taught us a lot of useful wet lab skills on our lab training                             tutorial. She often makes sure our team know where we are focusing and will guide us to the right                             direction. Especially for human practices, she always gives amazing advice to modify our plans.
Ka Man TAM, Sabrina
One of our best advisors that we are pleased to have.
She has taught us so many                             things in the lab and also in theory. She gives us advice from the very beginning of the project                             throughout the whole journey. Her advice on the project design and troubleshooting helps us to                             make our project better.
Tze Wing MAK, Tiffany
Our IT backup.
Tiffany knows well the importance of the wiki page. She gave us                             a lot of useful tips and helped us tackling technical problems. She appears to be very serious,                             but once she warms up, she has a pretty silly side too. She likes to call the iGEM girls "Dua                             eng" (which means "sweetheart" in Thai)
Mike DOROTHEA, Mike
The past secretary from last year's team.
Mike keeps us on a good manner for recording                             meeting minutes as well as all the public documents. She is a perfectionist who will make sure                             we follow the right nomenclature in all publications and annotate gel photo correctly.
Kar On CHENG, Karen
Our Lab Guider.
Karen ensures we do our lab work properly. She is very patient                             to our questions, always raises and gives useful suggestions to all the module groups and the                             auxiliary group. We are very pleased to have her!
Shek Chun LOI, Danson
The Elder Brother.
From what Katie have said, Danson "looks so old that was thought as a postgraduate".                             However, he is actually a nice advisor that he answer our questions and gave suggestions. He                             often gave advices that guide us into the right track.
Chui Shan KWOK, Cynthia
The Cutest Advisor.
Cynthia is a nice and helpful girl who always smiles. She gives us a helping hand even                             before we ask her. Her willingness smoothens our progress. She is also a very nice and reliable                             friend to have, both inside and outside the lab.
Our Instructors
Prof. King Lau Chow
Division of Life Science and Biomedical Engineering, HKUST
He is currently the Director of Interdisciplinary Programs Office. His research work spans a broad spectrum of biological                             sciences, with many different interdisciplinary collaboration. He has been engaged in iGEM activities                             for the past 9 years and sees it a very effective way of vertically integrating education while                             training our critical thinking skills. When we're facing problems, he encourages us to explore                             by ourselves rather than directly telling us the solution.
Dr. Jessica Ce Mun Tang
Division of Life Science, HKUST
Dr. Tang has been joining the iGEM team as an instructor for eight years. Prior to joining iGEM, most of the members, especially                             those from life science department, are already familiar with her since their first year as she                             is the course instructor for the General Biology course. She never puts on airs and has always                             treats us like more than a student of hers. Just like the lyrics, "Let this be our lesson in                             love. Let this be the way we remember us."
