Aim
- To share our iGEM experience and general approach on how to design an iGEM project to high school students.
Description
Our workshop targeted on future high school igem teams in Hong Kong. Prior to the sharing session, we got feedback that only a few high school students plan to join the iGEM in future. Our team was invited to teach them how to start an iGEM project.
We introduced a “Top-down Design” which is a common and easy method for high school students to brainstorm a project idea. We used the example of planning our summer vacation as a parallel comparison with the “Top-down Design” topic - building a system at hierarchical level (from large to small). We also mentioned some important issues that they should pay attention to. For example, biosafety and fundamental knowledges of synthetic biology.
Achievement
The students were appreciated by the concept and had a brief knowledge on project-designing. The teachers were really impressed by the workshop and had a strong interest in recruiting HKUST iGEM team to mentor and advise these students in the future.
