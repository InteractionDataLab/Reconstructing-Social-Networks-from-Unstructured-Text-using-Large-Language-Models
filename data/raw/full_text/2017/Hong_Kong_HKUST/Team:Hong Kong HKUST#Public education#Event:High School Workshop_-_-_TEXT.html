Aim
- To expose high school students with the general concepts of synthetic biology by holding a workshop.
Description
This workshop was held in Chinese as a medium of instruction to F5 (grade 11) students. In the workshop, a brief introduction of synthetic biology is first introduced, followed by explanation of relative concepts such as the Central Dogma, Recombinant DNA Technology and Biosafety. The process of transformation was carried out to familiarize students with what they had been learning in their biology class. Besides, materials for fruit DNA extraction experiments were given to groups of students to let them try out the implementation of scientific principles, and of course, have fun learning science!
Achievement
The feedbacks of workshop were satisfactory. Some students claimed that they had an interest in engaging into this field. Majority agreed that our workshop has influenced them in a field of synthetic biology.
