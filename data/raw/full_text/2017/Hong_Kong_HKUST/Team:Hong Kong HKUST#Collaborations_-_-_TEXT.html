SYSU Software iGEM team visualizations
Our team began to scrape team data and abstracts from the iGEM database using a web scraper, with the aim of                 identifying common themes between different teams, so as to create a tool that could potentially help teams                 find others with similar topics in the future. We wish to further improve the database by converting the                 csv file, which contains a lot of keywords, into a visualization where the output will be a visualized diagram                 that is easier to search, more creative and more user-friendly. Because our modelling team is not expert                 in making visualization using JavaScript, we decided to post our collaboration request on iGEM collaboration                 page to seek help from iGEM teams to improve the visualization for interested iGEM teams to use in the future.
SYSU software team was enthusiastic about this collaboration. We have achieved our final goal for this finished                 product, which is to put the Network Visualization on our wiki page!
This is how we make the visualization happen: CLICK ME
Modeling and characterization collaboration with CUHK
For modelling collaboration, our modelling team bidirectionally cooperated with CUHK's modelling team in the early summer.                 We contributed two Python scripts for CUHK team. One of them was for simulating and plotting an ODE-based                 model using Euler's method. The other was for simulating and plotting a stochastic model using a Gillespie                 algorithm. Both of these scripts were used for them to model the proportion of active and inactive toehold                 switches in their project.
In the opposite direction, we received from CUHK iGEM team a Python interface implemented with Cython that would                 allow us to call functions from a library called ViennaRNA which is written in C. Since it can be quite difficult                 to use functions between different languages like Python and C, and CUHK team’s interface greatly simplified                 our workload for modelling. We used this interface to estimate the dissociation constant for the antisense                 mRNA and transcript mRNA in our model.
For characterization collaboration, the CUHK team helped us with characterisation to further verify our Sensor                 Constructs (with Antisense RNA) using GFP assay. Analysis of the results is provided in our Sensing Module                 page. We greatly appreciate their help!
