What is Interlab?
InterLab Study is a measurement of GFP fluorescence among different lab organized by the iGEM community, aiming                 to produce common, comparable units for measuring GFP with different plate readers. This year (2017), 6 different                 RBS devices are tested.
Our Protocol
Transformation: please refer here for the protocol.
Calibration and Cell measurement :                     We were following the protocol provided except that we have measured the Abs595 instead of Abs600 due                     to the limitation of the plate reader in HKUST.
Plate reader :                     Envision Xcite Multilabel Plate Reader
Conversion from Abs595 to Abs600 (measured by spectrophotometer)

BBa_J364100 is a bicistronic design element (BCD2) that functions as a more controllable                 device to control translation comparing to prokaryotic RBS that may not be functionable with different coding                 sequences. In BCD, by ribosomes binding to the SD core sequence (SD1), the leader peptide will be synthesized,                 it gives SD1-directed ribosomes that recognizes and initiates translation via another SD site (SD2), following                 that, GOI (gene of interest) will be expressed.

Extensive Result Report
Conclusion
From the results obtained above, the promoters BBa_J23101, BBa_J23106 and BBa_J23117 has a decreasing promoter                 strength, while the RBS BBa_B0034 has a higher strength than BBa_J364100.
