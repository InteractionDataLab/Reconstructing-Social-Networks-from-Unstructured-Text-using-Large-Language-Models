We would like to thank all our sponsors. They do not realize how valuable their help has been to us. We wish to specially thank our university, Université catholique de Louvain, the Fondation Louvain, Fédération Wallonie Bruxelles, BIOLabs, Agilent technologies and ISV for financing us. Moreover, we'd particularly like to thank the AGL for helping us with the movie making. Last but not least, a great thank you to all the people who have believed in us and who have invested in our crowdfunding website.
Day to day support
An enormous thank to our four amazing PIs who helped us during this project: Pr. Patrice Soumillon, Pr. Charles Hachez, Pr. Bernard Hallet, Pr. Pascal Hols. Thank you for lending us some space in the lab, we hope we didn't take too much. Thank you for your advice and your accessibility. A huge thank you to all of your staff, Ph.D students and other who supported us during all this year.
