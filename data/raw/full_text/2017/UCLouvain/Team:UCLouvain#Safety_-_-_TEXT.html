SAFETY
Safety First!
LAB SAFETY
Safety is a key word when working in a laboratory. Each team member who worked in the lab received a guided tour and an introduction to safety protocols, including waste management, sterilization, clean lab coat, hand washing and so on. Sometimes, your protection equipment can turn into an unique Star Wars costume!
Most of the work made during our project was done in an L2 safety lab. The other part of the technical work concerns the printing of our bio badge 3D model. This work has been done in a chemistry lab that doesnâ€™t require specific biological safety protocols.
SAFE PROJECT DESIGN
The safety aspect of our project has always been in our minds while working on it, since the primary goal of the badge is to be used outside of the lab. We decided to design it in a way that prevents our modified bacteria from escaping into the environment. The badge includes a ring filled with bleach which is mixed with the bacteria contained into the capsule once it has been used. The bleach will rapidly kill the bacteria and ensure that none can escape. The risk of bacteria escaping into the environment is thus greatly reduced.
you think we're cool? so are our sponsors!
