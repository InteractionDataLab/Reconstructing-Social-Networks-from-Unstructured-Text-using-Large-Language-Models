L'UCL
Université Catholique de Louvain was founded in 1425 and saw numerous important persons within its halls.
For example, George Lemaître was one of the first and finest experts in Einstein’s general theory of relativity (1915). He connected the theory to experimental data proliferating in the field of astronomy and presented two hypotheses: the universe is both expanding and the result of an initial explosion of incredibly concentrated energy.
Christian de Duve (1917-2013) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1974 for identifying two organelles, the lysosome (1955) and the peroxisome (1965), which help cells absorb beneficial substances and reject others.
