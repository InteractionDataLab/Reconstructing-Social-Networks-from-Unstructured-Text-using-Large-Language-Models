Annotation
When we first got in touch with Wiki
We were confused by many technical terms
Through annotation, we hope our readers
Even they have no background knowledge
Can feel the interest of synthetic biology
Chinese Version
Language barrier always keeps many Chinese readers away
They are unable to reach numerous fantastic Wiki Pages
So we think the best way to promote synthetic biology in China
Is to make the Chinese version Wiki
Mobile device Adaptation
Mobile devices are gradually becoming the main way to surf the Internet
But most Wiki don't have specified adaptation to them
This time, we tried very hard to consider various devices
hoping people can find valuable information from Wiki anytime, anywhere.
