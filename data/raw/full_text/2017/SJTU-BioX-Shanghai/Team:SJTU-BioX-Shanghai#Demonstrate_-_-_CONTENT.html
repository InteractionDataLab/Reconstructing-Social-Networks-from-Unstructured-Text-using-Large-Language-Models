We use sfGFP(BBa_K515005) as the reporter gene, and design a series of experiments, using the change of fluorescence and OD600 to characterize the STAR system.</P><P>As the fig.1 and fig.2 show, during the 400mins of culture, the expression of sfGFP with target is far lower than those without.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 1 Schematic diagram of suppression of leaking characterization plasmids. </STRONG>The characterization plasmid containing Target1 was constructed on pCDFDuet-1 plasmid and the target plasmid containing Target3 was constructed on pETDuet-1 plasmid.

The initial point of the figure is 240 mins after culturing. In the comparison of the two STAR systems, it is obvious that the target of STAR3 system has a better inhibition effect as the difference from the blank control is subtle, while difference from that without the target is apparent. This indicates that target of STAR is successful in depressing the expression of sfGFP in both pCDFDuet-1 and pETDuet-1 plasmid. Also, this suggests that the target sequence of STAR is a promising tool to repress the leakage of downstream gene. In the experiment, we had 3 parallel biologic duplications, and the results consistently showed that Target3 can repress the downstream gene better than Target1. Figure 2C shows the difference between the normalized fluorescence of the experimental group at 600 min. Normalised fluorescence was calculated by dividing fluorescent signal by the O.D.600 value of the culture to eliminate the effect of bacterial growth on the fluorescence value.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure.2  Characterization of Target in DH5α E. coli cells. </STRONG>(A) Normalized fluorescence monitored over time for cell lines incorporating the Target1 sequence of STAR system in the absence or presence of transcribed target molecules.

The graphs from Figure 3C/3D represent the normalized fluorescence once the growth data (optical density) has been considered. The data from these graphs shows that sfGFP expression is increased more than 2-fold (for STAR1) and 4-fold (for STAR3) at 600 minutes of culturing, when STAR is present. This indicates that STAR is successful in the regulation of the growth repressing gene in our circuit. </P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 4 Characterization of STAR system in DH5α E. coli cells. </STRONG>Characterization of STAR system in DH5α E. coli cells.

In a large number of pigment proteins, we chose those with obvious color distinction, that is the three primary colors RGB (red, green, blue) for the experiment.

The lac operon is the one on MCS1 of plasmid pCDFDuet-1, and As promoter is provided by iGEM2006_Edinburgh BBa_J33201.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 8 lac operon and As promoter control STAR gene loop diagram. </STRONG>As promoter and lac operon should be added on the upstream of Antisense, and the two circuits is contructed on the same plasmid.</DIV></DIV><P>The characterization of lac responsiveness is mainly carried out using the STAR1 system, and sfGFP, which is more easily quantitatively monitored, is used as a downstream reporter gene to determine its accuracy. Afterwards, by using eforRed as the reporter gene, visualization of pigments was performed.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 9 Characterization of lac operon and As promoter for STAR. </STRONG>A) The presence of IPTG-induced STAR 1 system with lac operon in the case of fluorescence versus time. The plasmid we use is pCDF duet-1. Characterization cells are BL21 (DH3) E. coli. And each control group and experimental group were formed from the same colony. And a total of three repeated tests were conducted to verify the effectiveness. B) with eforRed as the downstream reporter gene STAR 1 system under lac operon’s manipulation of the color characterization C) As + STAR 3 system enzyme electrophoresis diagram. The marker used in the figure was DL2000, and the third lane was an expression product constructed using the restriction endonucleases NdeI and KpnI digested at both ends of As + antisense 3, and the second lane was a restriction on the use of T3 + sfGFP Endonuclease PstI and EcoRI digested to construct the expressed product. The electrophoresis tank buffer was 0.5 x TBE and the gel contained 1% agarose, using Dye DuRed, running 120 v / 100 mA for 20 min.</DIV></DIV><P>From the above, fluorescence emitted by gene under the control of STAR1 system containing lac operon changes over time. The difference between the group treated with ITPG and the control becomes greater and greater. The fluorescence of ITPG group generally not higher than the control and 10 hours after treating ITPG, fold activation reach a value of 6, which indicates that our STAR system is very effective as a RNA switch. Due to the limitation of time, we haven’t finished the characterization of STAR3 and chromoproteins so we plan to continue the rest of our work in the future. What’ more, according to the results from our characterization experiment, STAR3 system has greater fold activation than STAR1. There is every reason to believe that STAR3 system can response to change of environment more accurately. STAR systems are actually competent candidates for molecular switch.</P><P>On the part of regulation of As promoter, we have built the complete STAR3 system that can sense As3+. From the electrophoretogram, the first band is about 600-700bp, indicating the existence of As+A3, and the second band, about 900bp long, indicates the existence of T3+sfGFP. All of these result prove the success of our construction. In fact, we have proved that our construct is correct via Sanger Sequencing.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section5">Multi-factor detection</DIV><P>Due to the strong orthogonality of STAR system and the differences between colors of selected chromoproteins, we can build a multi-factor detection reporting system. In a multi-factor detection, the double-factor detection is the most direct and easiest to distinguish. The future iGEM team can use our reporting system to build their own multifactorial detection system by adding different downstream reporter genes.</P><P>To simulate the actual situation in multifactorial responds to the color changes incurred by factors of interest, we started with co-transformation of two plasmids containing different chromoproteins.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 10 Characterization of chromoprotein co-transformation.  </STRONG></DIV></DIV><P>We tried to use heavy metal ions as concrete examples of multiple factors. In the experiment, we selected As promoter and Co promoter as Antisense starting elements. Specifically, in the presence of As3 + and Co2 +, the corresponding repressor is released, activating the expression of antisense, subsequently reducing the inhibitory effect of Target. Next, downstream chromoproteins are expressed, resulting in obvious changes of colors. At the same time in a certain range of metal ion concentration, when the metal ion concentration increases, more Target are disrupted by Antisense, and the color gets brighter and brighter. And two STAR systems were established on different compatible plasmid backbone: pCDF duet-1, pET duet-1, which provided convenience for the transfer of the two expression vectors into the same host E. coli.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 11 gene circuit of multi-factor detection with STAR </STRONG></DIV></DIV><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text"><STRONG>Figure 12 electrophoretogram of Co+STAR1、As+STAR3 </STRONG></DIV></DIV><P>We have successfully construct STAR 1 system with Co promoter and STAR 3 system with As promoter separately.
