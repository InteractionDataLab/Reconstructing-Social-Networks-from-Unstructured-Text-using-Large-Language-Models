In July 30, we visited ECUST, having a face-to-face meeting and a lab tour. In the meeting, we helped them get a brief idea of what
                            modeling, human practice are, and gave them some advice on project designing, collaboration and visa application.
                        </P><P>Besides continuous communication, two teams collaborated on experiments. When their experiment encountered problems we helped then transform the part they needed. </P><P>In return, when we failed so many times in transforming CrtI ,they did the transformation for us which helped us proceed our project smoothly. Also, they provided us with pSB1C3 when we were short of plasmid skeleton. </P><P>And here is a table shows briefly what we have done for each other.

During the meetup, we listened to their project introduction and discussed some details with them about modeling and Human Practice. In the meeting,
                            we suggested them to think about finding an application for their project.</P><P class="my-title2">ZJUT-China</P><P>In April 2017, iGEM ZJUT-China team visited SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team in the Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This is the first year of ZJUT-China to attend iGEM competition. So the team members came to communicate
                            with our team. They shared their project and our instructor commented on their project and gave some advice. Students also had a communication on iGEM competition that it is not simply a scientific research program but connecting
                            with society by Human Practice.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text">Photo taken after meeting</DIV></DIV><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text">Two teams having a meeting together in SJTU Bio-X Insititutes</DIV></DIV><P class="my-title2">Online conference with CGU</P><P>We shared project and current progress with each other through Skype.

There are 8 teams participated in the conference: TJU
                            , UCAS, XMU, SCUT-A,
                            SCUT-B, FAFU, JLU
                            , and us SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We first introduced our project to each other including lab experiment, Human Practice, current progress and problems as well as willingness
                            to cooperate. Then we shared the information we had obtained lately, including some conclusion we had drawn after interviewing, investigating and reading literature.</P><P class="my-title2">Online conference held by XMU</P><P>This conference is mainly held for communication. We participated in that using Skype with UCAS, XMU, NCKU and SCUT-A. </P><P>
                            We learned that SCUT-A was dealing with a color analysis application which is similar to what we have achieved in our app. We shared the theory of our app with them and offered them suggestion on developing such app. NCKU mentioned CGU who was doing some
                            image processing work and suggested us that CGU may provide us some advice on developing app. We then had an online conference with CGU which we will write about later.</P><P>What’s more, NCKU gave us advice on bacterium conservation. When we mentioned we use paper to hold bacteria, they suggested us that we could apply the technique of lyophilized. It was helpful and we took it into consideration when
                            we discussed the possible methods to conserve the bacteria.
