Bozitao Zhong
Sophomore, major in bioinformatics
School of Life Science and Biotechnology
The team leader of our team.
I like biology, and iGEM let get intense interaction with the lab work.
After complete to organize a program, I think my dream can soon come true.
And my interesting lines:
I've seen things people wouldn't believe.
Attack groups on fire under the inert environment.
I watched x-rays glitter in the dark near the lattice defect.
All those...moments will be lost...in time.
Like aromaticity in the ring.

Junior, major in bioengineering
School of Life Science and Biotechnology
I possess the knowledge of many subjects like digital circuit and computer science. I am good at analyzing data and phenomenon based on what I learn and know a little about machine manipulation. I designed most of parts in our                             project, but besides that I was doing PCR all the time which was really boring. I love swimming very much and once liked playing the Rubik’s Cube.
Wish to have a good trip in the US and have fantastic experience. I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.

Working in the lab with a group of doggies and a little cat during the past five months brought me many happiness. Although the experiment was very repetitive and boring, I gain a lot in this process.

love studying and staying up
love drama and movie
and big brother is watching you
Chang Gao
Sophomore, major in biotechnology

I'm the small cat in this team. I like stars, those sparkling things on the sky.
It’s a gift for me to be one number in this team. I become the device (small CAT) in this project. I’ m interested in the small activating transcriptional RNAs (STAR) in this project. Happy to be one part in this team!
Xueqi Li
Senior, major in bioengineering
School of Life Science and Biotechnology
As the eldest student in this team who is nearly graduate,I think this competition is a superexcellent gift for my undergraduate years.
Like everything without study
Appear in everywhere you want

Junior, major in Biomedical Engineering
School of Biomedical Engineering
Multidisciplinary integration
Intersection of Art and Science
These concepts deeply attract me
This is the reason why iGEM is deeply attractive to me
And this is what I did
Zhengsong Pan
Sophomore, major in bioinformatics
School of Life Science and Biotechnology
The “song” in Chinese means pine.
I am willing to be a strong pine, steadily growing in my life.
I believe time, I believe the future, I believe I can.
Just as I believe our project, our team partners and our iGEM.
I love eating, I love reading, I love travelling.
Just as I love life and I want to have a good time every moment and everyday!
Yi Yang
Junor, major in biotechnology
School of Life Science and Biotechnology
A dreamer and a madman.
Keep eyes on the stars and feet on the ground.
Half in the ancient China and half in the modern life.
Being intermittently excited but insistently sitting around waiting to die.
Doggie is a bad art designer who doesn't dream of doing experiment.
Enjoying solitude.
Ruoci Shen
Sophomore, major in Material Science and Engineering
School of Material Science and Engineering
As the only member who majors in Material Science and Engineering, I take interest in a variety of things. And that’s why I am here participating iGEM competition.
Be enthusiastic towards the world, and be curious about new things. Embrace my life and the world with love, music and dancing. Looking forward to meeting you from all over the world in iGEM!

Junior, major in bioinformatics
School of Life Science and Biotechnology
I love mathematics far better than biology and computer science.
I love history and geography far better than mathematics.
I love unsolved mystery far better than history and geography.
I love life far better than everything.
I only hate the lessons that start at eight a.m.
My life credo is that where there is light, there is shadow.
Ruiyang Zhao
Sophomore, major in Biomedical Engineering
School of Biomedical Engineering
I have a lot of hobbies, including jogging ,playing musical instruments and photography.
And I am happy to communicate with those who have the same hobbies. Looking forward to becoming friends with you.
Hang Tao
I am a senior high school student from China，and my name is Taohang. I am currently studying at No.7 middle school in anqing，anhui province. In my studies, my favorite is English and biology. In my spare time，basketball，running                             and pingpang，which are all my hobby.
Yuchen Wang
Junior student
St. Mark's School
Love biology and epidemiology. Like exploring biomedical science to resolve challenges in health care.Attended Outreach360 Volunteer twice in Dominican Republic and also researched in Zika Virus disease control.                        I can conduct hands-on labs quietly, while run fast on the cross country course. I speak multiple languages, play different musical instruments, and travel around the world for fun.
