These problems mainly include:</P><P>Data processing equipment: it use PC end to process data. Although you can use the server for data transmission, but it is contrary to the original intention of APP processing data.</P><P>The design of the original box is unreasonable: the original box relies too much on the smartphone model; the impact of the distance between the reaction area and the light source  or  the camera on imaging is not considered.</P><P>The influence of data volume on the accuracy of results: the amount of data in the original double protein reaction system is too small, which will affect the accuracy of the results.
</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section2">Applicable conditions after improvement</DIV><P>The reaction system of double ionic induced double protein expression tends to be mature and stable;</P><P>A team can perform large-scale accurate data collection;</P><P>Commercial success of complete project.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section3">Design and manufacture of reaction card</DIV><P>The reacted card is shown in the following figure. The mixed color card is on the left. The two ions are mixed at different concentrations, and then induced two proteins expression that produces many mixed colors. A large number of experimental data about the mixed colors  can be drawn a color gradient cards, which is called the mixed color card, a part of the reacted card. The location of the point on the card corresponds to the concentration of the two ions when the mixed color is the same as the color of a point. The bacteria is placed in the green area, which is the reaction area. It is conducive to commercial applications. The reaction card can be produced rapidly and without additional standard reaction area which saves the cost. Moreover, the same box can be used many times. At the same time, each detection will photograph mixed color card again, which eliminates the impact of many external factors on the accuracy of the analysis, including light and card materials and other factors.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section4">Improvement of reaction box and APP</DIV><P>The hole position of the box is changed from the corner to the middle, which has three benefits: </P><P>it reduces the impact  of the distance between the reaction area and the light sourse  or  the camera on imaging;</P><P>it can be applied to all kinds of smartphones;</P><P>It enhances the tightness of the box and reduces the influence of the external light source on the photograph.</P><P>But it also poses a problem that the area is photographed becomes inaccurate. Thus, APP is improved, which adds a cross at the interface center during the filming of APP.</P><P>At the same time, the center of the reaction card is also increased a cross (The Green Cross shown above). If the two cross is coincident, the area is photographed is correct.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section5">workflow</DIV><P>The user takes photos after the sample is fully reacted in the reaction area. The color information of the two areas is obtained after taking photos. The RGB value of the reaction region and the RGB value of the color mixing region are compared to get the position of the corresponding color point on the reaction card, so as to obtain two ionic concentrations respectively.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section6">Further assumptions</DIV><P>Brevity is the most beautiful thing! In the above design, it can be further simplified. The figure is as follows. The middle region is a reaction region, and the annular region is for calibration. The mixed color card can be cancelled and the corresponding data is stored directly in the APP, while the calibration area is used to eliminate the impact of many external factors on the accuracy of the analysis, including light and card materials and other factors. The principle of the calibration area is similar to the calibration principle of the blank liquid of the spectrophotometer. The white calibration area is used to adjust the mixed color data stored in the APP. The rest principle and operation are the same as before.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="footer-L"><A class="footer-text" href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai/Results"><SPAN class="direction">Project</SPAN><DIV class="title">
