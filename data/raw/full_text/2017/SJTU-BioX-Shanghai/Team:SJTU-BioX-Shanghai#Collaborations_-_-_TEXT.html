One-to-one communication
ECUST
This year, we developed a close relationship with an iGEM new comer—ECUST iGEM team.
Since SJTU-BioX-Shanghai is a more experienced team, we offer our help to new team to our best. In July 30, we visited ECUST, having a face-to-face meeting and a lab tour. In the meeting, we helped them get a brief idea of what                             modeling, human practice are, and gave them some advice on project designing, collaboration and visa application.
Besides continuous communication, two teams collaborated on experiments. When their experiment encountered problems we helped then transform the part they needed.
In return, when we failed so many times in transforming CrtI ,they did the transformation for us which helped us proceed our project smoothly. Also, they provided us with pSB1C3 when we were short of plasmid skeleton.
And here is a table shows briefly what we have done for each other. For more information, please visit ECUST collaboration page.

Having a meeting discussing projects and iGEM competition
Shanghai Tech University
In July 2017, we visited Shanghai Tech University and participated in their meetup. During the meetup, we listened to their project introduction and discussed some details with them about modeling and Human Practice. In the meeting,                             we suggested them to think about finding an application for their project.
ZJUT-China
In April 2017, iGEM ZJUT-China team visited SJTU-BioX-Shanghai team in the Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This is the first year of ZJUT-China to attend iGEM competition. So the team members came to communicate                             with our team. They shared their project and our instructor commented on their project and gave some advice. Students also had a communication on iGEM competition that it is not simply a scientific research program but connecting                             with society by Human Practice.

Online conference with CGU
We shared project and current progress with each other through Skype. What’s more, we had a further discussion concerning image processing.
Meetups
Online conference about heavy ion pollution
We had an online conference about potential collaboration about China’s current situation of water pollution. There are 8 teams participated in the conference: TJU , UCAS, XMU, SCUT-A ,                             SCUT-B, FAFU , JLU , and us SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. We first introduced our project to each other including lab experiment, Human Practice, current progress and problems as well as willingness                             to cooperate. Then we shared the information we had obtained lately, including some conclusion we had drawn after interviewing, investigating and reading literature.
Online conference held by XMU
This conference is mainly held for communication. We participated in that using Skype with UCAS, XMU, NCKU and SCUT-A.
We learned that SCUT-A was dealing with a color analysis application which is similar to what we have achieved in our app. We shared the theory of our app with them and offered them suggestion on developing such app. NCKU mentioned CGU who was doing some                             image processing work and suggested us that CGU may provide us some advice on developing app. We then had an online conference with CGU which we will write about later.
What’s more, NCKU gave us advice on bacterium conservation. When we mentioned we use paper to hold bacteria, they suggested us that we could apply the technique of lyophilized. It was helpful and we took it into consideration when                             we discussed the possible methods to conserve the bacteria.
1st Collaborative Innovation Online-conference for iGEM
Community open day held by Tongji University
This year, we went to fablab in Tongji University and participated in the open day hosted by Tongji University. We brought our project to the activity and shared it with other schools and residents who came by that day. The community                             open day attracted many people stop to listen. Meanwhile, it was also broadcast live online.
