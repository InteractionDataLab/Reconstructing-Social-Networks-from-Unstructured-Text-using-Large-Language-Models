Introduction
We first seek for a suitable loader for our engineered bacteria, after we had the plan to make a product. In order to make bacteria fixed and to present a clear color for photography and color analysis, we considered three possible                             loaders. We had three potentials evaluated. Finally, we decided to take glass fiber filter paper as our loader.
Chip
We got the idea of combining chip with our project when communicating with Prof. Xiang Chen from Micro/Nano Research Institute of SJTU. Chip provided by their lab is a flexible carrier with a micro chamber which is made of PDMS                             material. The micro chamber has a height of approximately 80-100 μm and can be filled with 2-3 μL of solution to the maximum.
Chip is a small-sized and low-cost carrier. It can be combined with a box holding a smart phone. The box can further be applied to photo analysis with the chip（Kanakasabapathy, M. K., et.al，2017）. We planned to have a combination                             with smart phone since smart phone enjoys greater popularity and most products have a tendency to be mobilized. Meanwhile, chip is light and small, whose characteristics exactly fit our need for making a portable tool.
To demonstrate the feasibility of the chip, we carried out experiment. We added 2μL mutant RFP solution into the chip chamber and observed the color. As is shown in Fig.1, color is indistinguishable wherever observed, under naked                             eye or in picture. We then tried to have centrifuged hoping the color will be more distinctive. However, the color is still hard to tell (Fig.2).

We supposed that the reason why color was not distinctive was the small size of the chamber. So we put our chip under microscope to take a look. It is shown in Fig.3 that it is difficult to distinguish red color from the picture. Though red color can be observed on the wall of the chamber after centrifugation of 4k rpm, chip is not suitable for photo analysis.
Besides weak color presentation, another negative characteristic of the chip is tough condition for long-term culture of bacteria. The reaction period of our engineered bacteria will last several hours, so the culture medium inside                             the chip may not be able to support the normal production of bacteria.

Microdroplet
When communicating with our advisor Prof. Chen, we learned that Microdroplet is an extending area of microfluidics field.
We found it specially beneficial in providing nutrition to bacteria. Microdroplet is made of agarose in which we can add some nutrients. If we wrap the bacteria with nutritious agarose, we can culture bacteria in a microdroplet.                             So microdroplet is better than chip considering the aspect of culturing.
However, we learned from a senior that microdroplet is not suitable for our project. He told us that microdroplet is so small in size that it will suspend on the liquid, resulting in the number of bacteria in each region uneven.                             Thus, the color taken from photographing will have a difference if the shooting position changes, leading to a greater deviation of the results of color analysis. So we gave up the idea of applying microdroplet.
Glass Fiber Filter Paper
Ostrov et. al. (2017), presented another method of fixing bacteria in their article. They used glass fiber filter papers as the carrier of the bacteria. Because the pore size of glass fiber filters is 0.7μm, which is close to the                             diameter of E. coli. Thus, E. coli can be attached to the paper without leakage.
We applied the method of vacuum filtration, with a mold controlling the range of the bacteria to have a circle of                             5mm diameter. The bacteria will present a uniform colored round. In order to test whether the paper can effectively show clear color and even the difference between colors, we carried out the following experiment. A serial                             dilution of amilCP solution was carried out. We had 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x dilution in row. After filtration, naked eyes can clearly observe the gradient of color changes.

We then tried to analyze our color using our app version No.1 to get the statistics about grayscale. Statistics shown in Table.1.
