DNA Gel Electrophoresis
Materials:
Agarose
TBE Buffer
Gel board
EB
DNA×10 or×6 Loading Buffer
Electrophoresis tank
sample
marker 2000 or 15000
Methods:
Make a 1.0%-1.5% Agarose gel according to the volume of your gel board (eg. add 0.45g Agarose in 30ml TBE if choose a concentration of 1.5%)
Heat the container with the mixture until it is complete dissolved. When the solution starts boiling, stop heating, shake the container until materials mix well and heat again until the mixture become clear
Wait until the solution cools down to 50℃,add 0.01% EB (eg. 3μin 30ml) or non-poisonous dyes instead
Pour the solution into a gel board and insert the comb
Set the gel at room temperature and wait until it completely solidifies
Remove the comb and transfer the gel to the electrophoresis tank
Add samples into pores with 40% DNA Loading Buffer (eg. 2μLoading Buffer in 5μDNA sample)
Run the gel for 20 min at 100V, 100mA
Transformation
Materials:
LB broth
Ice
Selection plates with corresponding antibiotics.
Methods:
Put 50µL competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes
Add 20 µl DNA from a ligation reaction mix or 10-100 ng plasmid
Incubate the mixture on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 45 seconds
Place on ice for 3 minutes
add the mixture into 500 µL LB broth
Incubate at 37°C and 200-250 rpm for one hour
For ligation reaction DNA: 500 µl of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate. For known plasmid: 100-200 µL of each transformation reaction onto a selection plate
Incubate overnight at 37°C with plates upside down.
Purification and Gel Extraction & Plasmid Extraction
Purification of PCR or restriction products was performed according to the OMEGA Cycle Pure Kit D6492.
Gel Extraction was performed according to the OMEGA Gel Extraction Kit D2500.
Plasmid Extraction was performed according to the BIOMIGA Plasmid Miniprep Kit.
Air Pump Filtration
Materials:
vacuum pump
filter paper
cell culture
mould
Methods:
Assemble the pump and place the filter paper into the funnel correctly
Put the mould onto the filter paper
Switch on the vacuum pump
Add 200μl E.coli culture to the center of the mould
Wait until the liquid drained out completely, put out the filter paper
Characterization
Materials:
Replica plate with GFP
Appropriate antibiotic
LB broth
96 well plate
Microplate reader
Methods:
1. Pick appropriate clones from the plate to the 5ml LB broth with antibiotic
2. Grow cells in shacking bed and 37℃ until the OD reaches 0.6
3. Seed cells in the 96 well plat at 200μL per well every two hours, put back the rest solutions and keep growing until the OD becomes stable
4. Set 96 well plate in the microplate reader and read data
