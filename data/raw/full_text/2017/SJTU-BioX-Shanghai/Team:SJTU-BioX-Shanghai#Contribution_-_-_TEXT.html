This summer, we designed another STAR system to achieve multiple factors detection. To make these systems more convenient, we constructed both Target and STAR(called Antisense in our project) on the same plasmid. In order to know whether the characteristics change, we conducted the same experiment again but in our dual-expression plasmid pCDF-Duet1 based on the characterization above. To distinguish two systems, we call our new STAR system STAR3 and the STAR system used by Imperial College STAR1(Part:BBa_K1893013).
Figure 1(A) (B) : Characterization of STARs system in DH5α strain with pCDF as vector. Nomalized fluorescence over time for cell growth incorporating Star1 system in the absence or presence of transcribed Antisense Molecules. We used the dual-expression plasmid pCDF-Duet1. For the absence of Antisense1, the plasmid just includes Target1 in the MCS1. For the presence of Antisense1, Antisense1 is inserted into MCS2. For control(background), only pCDF backbone is transformed into DH5α.
