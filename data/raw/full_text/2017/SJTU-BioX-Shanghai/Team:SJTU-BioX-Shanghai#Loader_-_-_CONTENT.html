In order to make bacteria fixed and to present a clear color for photography and color analysis, we considered three possible
                            loaders. We had three potentials evaluated. Finally, we decided to take glass fiber filter paper as our loader.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section2">Chip</DIV><P>We got the idea of combining chip with our project when communicating with Prof. Xiang Chen from Micro/Nano Research Institute of SJTU. Chip provided by their lab is a flexible carrier with a micro chamber which is made of PDMS
                            material. The micro chamber has a height of approximately 80-100 μm and can be filled with 2-3 μL of solution to the maximum.</P><P>Chip is a small-sized and low-cost carrier. It can be combined with a box holding a smart phone. The box can further be applied to photo analysis with the chip（Kanakasabapathy, M. K., et.al，2017）. We planned to have a combination
                            with smart phone since smart phone enjoys greater popularity and most products have a tendency to be mobilized. Meanwhile, chip is light and small, whose characteristics exactly fit our need for making a portable tool.</P><P>To demonstrate the feasibility of the chip, we carried out experiment. We added 2μL mutant RFP solution into the chip chamber and observed the color. As is shown in Fig.1, color is indistinguishable wherever observed, under naked
                            eye or in picture. We then tried to have centrifuged hoping the color will be more distinctive. However, the color is still hard to tell (Fig.2).</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text">Fig.1 （a）Chip photographed by mobile phone.

Solution is added into the labelled chamber on the left. (b) The color of the centrifugal solution inside an EP tube</DIV></DIV><P>We supposed that the reason why color was not distinctive was the small size of the chamber. So we put our chip under microscope to take a look. It is shown in Fig.3 that it is difficult to distinguish red color from the picture.
                            Though red color can be observed on the wall of the chamber after <SPAN class="toolt" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Centrifugation is a process which involves the application of the centrifugal force for the sedimentation of heterogeneous mixtures with a centrifuge, and is used in industrial and laboratory settings.">centrifugation</SPAN> of 4k rpm, chip is not suitable for photo analysis.</P><P>Besides weak color presentation, another negative characteristic of the chip is tough condition for long-term culture of bacteria. The reaction period of our engineered bacteria will last several hours, so the culture medium inside
                            the chip may not be able to support the normal production of bacteria.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text">Fig.3 （a）RFP solution observed under microscope without centrifugation（b）RFP solution observed under microscope after centrifugation of 2k rpm（c）RFP solution observed under microscope after centrifugation of 4k rpm</DIV></DIV><P>Picture（a）,（b）,（c）is exposed for 4ms, at 10x magnification.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section3">Microdroplet</DIV><P>When communicating with our advisor Prof. Chen, we learned that <SPAN class="toolt" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Microdroplet technology has recently been exploited to provide new and diverse applications
                            via microfluidic functionality, especially in the arenas of biology and chemistry. Cited from Microdroplet Technology">Microdroplet</SPAN> is an extending area of microfluidics field. </P><P>We found it specially beneficial in providing nutrition to bacteria. Microdroplet is made of agarose in which we can add some nutrients. If we wrap the bacteria with nutritious agarose, we can culture bacteria in a microdroplet.
                            So microdroplet is better than chip considering the aspect of culturing.</P><P>However, we learned from a senior that microdroplet is not suitable for our project. He told us that microdroplet is so small in size that it will suspend on the liquid, resulting in the number of bacteria in each region uneven.
                            Thus, the color taken from photographing will have a difference if the shooting position changes, leading to a greater deviation of the results of color analysis. So we gave up the idea of applying microdroplet.</P><DIV class="my-title h5-my-responsive" id="section4">Glass Fiber Filter Paper</DIV><P>Ostrov et. al. (2017), presented another method of fixing bacteria in their article. They used glass fiber filter papers as the carrier of the bacteria. Because the pore size of glass fiber filters is 0.7μm, which is close to the
                            diameter of E. coli. Thus, E. coli can be attached to the paper without leakage.</P><P>We applied the method of <SPAN class="toolt" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Vacuum filtration is a technique for separating a solid product from a solvent or liquid reaction mixture. The mixture of solid and liquid is poured through a filter paper
                            in a Buchner funnel. The solid is trapped by the filter and the liquid is drawn through the funnel into the flask below, by a vacuum. From dartmouth.edu">vacuum filtration</SPAN>, with a mold controlling the range of the bacteria to have a circle of
                            5mm diameter. The bacteria will present a uniform colored round. In order to test whether the paper can effectively show clear color and even the difference between colors, we carried out the following experiment. A serial
                            dilution of amilCP solution was carried out. We had 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x dilution in row. After filtration, naked eyes can clearly observe the gradient of color changes.</P><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text">Fig.4 Colors shown on the paper after filtration</DIV></DIV><DIV class="figure-intro"><DIV class="figure-text">Fig.5 Color comparison between solution and papers</DIV></DIV><P>We then tried to analyze our color using our app version No.1 to get the statistics about grayscale.
