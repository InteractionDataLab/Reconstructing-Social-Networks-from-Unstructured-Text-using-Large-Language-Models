This year, we put forward a method to analyze and present Integrated Human Practice which is named “ Subject Analysis Method”. We make use of this method to analyze our Integrated Human Practice and we have achieved good results. Thus, we hope we can promote our method to more teams.
We wrote a business plan to have a deep analysis of our product. In an attempt to show our potential to investors.
When we were designing our project, a great idea given by Professor Ronggui Lee inspired us to have our project today. Prof. Xiang Chen inspired us to have a loader and gave assistance to us in designing a box. In return, we helped their research work by providing engineering bacteria. Prof. Shiyong Liu instructed us on principles of color superposition which benefited our game design… The development and completion of our whole project is in a process of interacting with society.
