We also designed and made a box which could help us take photos to estimate the concentrations of two kinds of inducers. It will provide a stable experimental environment in the calculation process, and a reduced influence of light environment sensitivity of RGB color space. It consists of two parts: Shell and Body. The Shell includes a flat board for mobile phone and a hole for camera lens, and it could slide on the Body freely. The Body includes an ingenious square box, plenty of small circular holes for glass fiber filters and it’s available for a delicate LED.
The box is made of resin. The total weight of the box is 280g. The volume of the phone chamber is 65646.83 mm3, and that of the body is 154473.55 mm3. Detailed size for the chamber is 73.45*16.25*146.60 mm and that of the body is 70.00*89.00*148.60 mm.
This box serves various functions:(1)Fix most mobile phones and help users put their phones to a suitable position to take photos.(2)Include many small circular holes for glass fiber filters which contains our E.coli & inducer liquor.(3)Convenient for users to put into and take out filter scraps.
