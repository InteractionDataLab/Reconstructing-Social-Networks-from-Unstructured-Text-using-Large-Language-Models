Signal Pathway Model
Our model helps describe intracellular interactions of our multifactorial visualized detection system. We also use it to analyze and evaluate our synthetic biology system. The model was built using Simbiology, a MATLAB toolbox.
From these figures, we find several typical patterns of species variation. And the result of our experiments also fits these patterns well.
Pathway Illustration
Figure1: Signal Pathway constructInducers enters the cell, activates receptor and binding with repressor protein, leading to antisense producing. Then antisense binds with STAR. Finally sfGFP expression starts.

Figure2: sfGFP degradation over time.
Figure3: antiSTAR1 variation over time.
Figure4: STAR & STAR_complex variation over time.
Figure5: sfGFP& STAR_complex variation over time.
From these figures, we find several typical patterns of species variation. And the Results of our experiments also fits these patterns well.
