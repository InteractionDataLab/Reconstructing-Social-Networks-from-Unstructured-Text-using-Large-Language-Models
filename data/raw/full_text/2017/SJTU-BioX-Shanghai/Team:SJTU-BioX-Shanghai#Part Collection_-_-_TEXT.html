STAR-Chromoprotein
We chose parts we have built relevant to our multifactorial visualized detection system for this year’s parts collection.
How to design your own multifactorial visualized detection system?
Figure 1. The STAR-chromoprotein construct.
To illustrate, we have built two circuit to detect two heavy metal ions, As and Co. (For more information about how these circuits detect factors, see our Design page )                             What should be noticed is although we used heavy metal ions detection promoters, there are indeed many promoters you can used to control circuits such as promoter relative to light, cellular signaling construction and change                             of human body environment.
