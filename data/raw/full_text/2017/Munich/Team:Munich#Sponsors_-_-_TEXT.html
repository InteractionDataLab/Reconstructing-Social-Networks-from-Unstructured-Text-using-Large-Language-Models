Nanosystems Initiative München (NIM)
The NIM cluster is a member of the Excellence Initiative of the German government. Its goal is to bring together the expertise and experience of scientists in the fields of physics, biochemistry, electrical engineering and medicine among others to develop nanoscale building blocks and integrate them into coherent nanosystems with a wide and powerful range of applications. In addition, NIM promotes scientific careers by supporting student projects and offering graduate programs for young scientists.
GRK2062 Molecular Principles of Synthetic Biology
The GRK2062 is a Research training group that provides an innovative PhD training program in Synthetic Biology with a focus in interdisciplinary education. By promoting collaboration of scientists in the fields of physics, biology and chemistry, the GRK2062 has a wide array of research projects that properly mirror the interdisciplinary nature of Synthetic Biology. The communication between the different fields is facilitated thanks to the holistic program of both practical and theoretical courses that the GRK2062 offers their doctoral researches.
Industry sponsors
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT)
Integrated DNA Technologies is one of the largest manufacturers of oligonucleotides in the world, offering also solutions in genome editing, gene synthesis and sequencing. IDT is a reliable partner for oligo-synthesis and, thanks to its vast expertise and experience, delivers a high-quality product in record time. Many of our cloning and sequencing primers were synthesized by them and without their help, this project would not have been possible.
biomers.net
biomers.net specializes in the synthesis of oligonucleotides of all kinds. From primers to modified RNA sequences, biomers.net is an amazing partner for all scientists working with nucleotides. Their rigorous quality control and helpful support guarantee that their products are always a good choice. We are deeply grateful for their generous sponsorship, which allowed us to synthesize primers, DNA templates for target RNA and crRNA sequences, among others.
New England Biolabs
New England Biolabs provides many labs around the world with enzymes and a wide array of essential buffers for life sciences applications. As an industry leader, NEB has become one of the best suppliers for kits and enzymatic assays. We would like to thank them for their products, as their enzymes played a central part in our experiments and their kits and assays were important benchmarks.
GATC Biotech
GATC Biotech is one of Europe's most renown sequencing companies. Founded in 1990, they were one of the first providers of non-radioactive sequencing and have been innovating in the field ever since. Be it transcriptomics, genomics, single samples or whole genomes, GATC Biotech presents a high-quality solution. Many thanks to GATC Biotech for offering their sequencing service to us and helping us validate our plasmids and BioBricks.
