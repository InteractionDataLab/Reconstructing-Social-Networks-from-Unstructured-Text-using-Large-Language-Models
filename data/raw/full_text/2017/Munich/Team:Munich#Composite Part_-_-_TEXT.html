Thanks to advances in molecular biology and biochemistry, scientists have been able to consistently detect lower and lower concentration of molecules 1 , to the point that single molecules can be reliably recognized with methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 2 , fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 3 and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 4 . This has opened doors for synthetic biology to create better and more accurate diagnostic tests that use biomarkers like nucleic acids and proteins as targets 5 , 6 . Through such advances, the field of molecular diagnostics developed. Unfortunately, current standard methods require expensive equipment or trained personnel, which generally limits their usability to hospitals or laboratories. Recently, there has been a push to develop new tests that fuse the reliability of standard methods with affordable platforms such as lab-on-a-chip or paper strips  to overcome this restrictions 7-9 . We wanted to help close this gap and set out to engineer a diagnosis principle for the detection of a wide array of targets that could be used without difficult-to-meet technical requirements.
