Introduction
Our pathogen detection approach relies on Cas13a digesting RNA. A change in fluorescence is the most convenient way to take trace of such enzyme kinetics. This is impractical for in-field applications because commercial fluorescence detectors are expensive and inconveniently large. A straight forward approach for making our pathogen detection fit for in-field applications is a cheap and handy fluorescence detector. Other iGEM teams already constructed fluorescence detectors. We therefore rated detectors of other teams in a cost vs sensitivity diagram. Nevertheless non of them had a high enough sensitivity or the ability to measured fluorescence quantitatively. We therefore constructed a detector matching our requirements. Our detector is paper-based and can detect fluorescein concentration down to 200 nM. The detector is able measure to automatically measure fluorescence in units of equivalent fluorescein concentrations. The detector is very compact and costs less than 15 EUR. We were able to measure a time trace of Cas13a digesting RNaseAlert with our detector. For comparison we also measured a positive control containing RNase A and a negative control containing only RNaseAlert. The data are displayed in image  [img:k3]. The time traces show an enzymatic reaction taking place on filter paper. This proves that our detector is sensitive enough and meets our requirements. However the detector is not limited to the detection of our specific application. It can be used for the detection of any fluorescence signal in biological or chemical systems. We think that our detector can benefit other iGEM teams and also research groups that want to make a fluorescence based detection fit for in-field applications.

Principle design
Light from a blue LED is filtered by the blue filter foil. The light from the LED excites fluorophores on a filter paper. The excitation light is blocked by an orange filter foil. The fluorescence light from the excited fluoroscopes passes through the orange filter foil and illuminates and light dependent resistor (LDR). The LDR changes its resistance corresponding to the degree of illumination with fluorescence light. An Arduino nano measures the resistance via a voltage divider and calculates the fluorophore concentration.
Components
Micro controller
We used an Arduino nano for automatized data collection. This micro controller has analogue pins that can measure voltages from 0 to 5 V. The output is an integer from 0 to 1023 corresponding to the voltage at the analogue pin. The micro controller is connected via an USB port with a computer where the data can be processed further.

For the detection of fluorescence light we used an light depending resistor (LDR). An LDR is a resistor which decreases its resistance RLDR

The response of a LDR depends on the wavelength λ
λ
of the incoming light. The data sheet provides information on the relative response normalized to the maximal response. The relative response is maximum for a wavelength of 540 nm and is therefore appropriate for detection of green fluorophores.

Light emitting diode (LED)
To detect green fluorophores we choose a blue LED with peak emission at 470 nm. For optimum performance we choose the brightest LED we could find. The LED used has a luminous intensity of 12 cd, a maximum current of 20 mA and a forward voltage of 3.2 V
NPN transistor
To provide a stable illumination, it is crucial to supply the LED with a constant voltage. We therefore control it via a NPN transistor with type designation BC635. Its base-emitter-on voltage is 2 V.
Control circuit for the LED
The digital output pin is connected via a voltage divider to the base of the transistor. The voltage divider consist of the resistor R1

was chosen empirically to limit the LEDs working current and to power it at maximum brightness.
Light filter foils
For filtering the emission and excitation light we used filter foils from LEE filters. The producer provides transmission spectra for every filter foil. For the excitation filter we choose the filter colour “TOKYO BLUE” and for the emission filter we choose the filter colour “RUST”. We took care that the transmission spectra of the filters have no overlap. We measured the transmissions spectra of the foils our self. The data are shown in image  [img:k2]. We also measured the transmission spectra of two blue filter foils combined with one orange filter foil. For this combination there is nearly no transmission up to a wavelength of 700 nm. This combination is sufficient for blocking the excitation light of the blue LED from reaching the LDR.
emission spectra of light filter foils
Filter paper
We choose glass fiber filter paper from Whatman Laboratory Products with type designation “934-AH” to detect fluorescence on. Because normal cellulose filter paper is auto fluorescent and causes a high background signal.
3D printed parts
We intended to have the LED,the fluorescence sample and the LDR in direct proximity. This ensures a maximum use excitation light from the LED and emission light from the fluorophores. We therefore choose a sandwich-like design for our sample holder that can be placed into a slot were a detection system snaps in keeps the sample in position.
In detail, two blue filter foils are stacked and glued with tape in front of two excitation windows of the upper halve of the sandwich. One orange filter foil is glued in front of the two detection windows on the lower half of the sandwich. The two detection and emission windows enable us to measure a blank sample and an actual sample with the exact same set-up. Care needs to be taken that no tape is covering the detection or excitation windows because tape is usually auto fluorescent and causes a high background signal. A piece of filter paper is placed between the two halves of the sandwich. The upper and lower part of this sandwich and pressed together with magnets and hold the filter paper in position. The magnets ensure an user-friendly exchange of filter papers. The sandwich can now be inserted into the slot of the detection device. The LED and the LDR are mounted onto beams at opposite sites of the detection device. The sandwich snaps in when the LED and the LDR are at the right position under the excitation and over detection window. Four magnets apply an additional force to the beams and press the LED and the LDR close together. The design ensures that the distance between filter paper, LED and LDR is only limited by the thickness of the filter foils.

Data collecting and processing with the micro controller
We want to verify if a reaction with a fluorescence product is taking place on a filter paper. Therefore we need to measure the resistance RLDR
R
L
D
R
of the LDR over a certain time certain period. We choose to measure a data point every 5 min over a time period of 1 h to take trace of the reaction kinesics. Before such a measurement series a blank measurement with plain water is performed to determine the resistance Rb
R
b
.
As a first step the exact value of the supply voltage U0
U
0
needs to be measured. The supply voltage is connected via an additional voltage divider with an analogue pin. The voltage divider consists of a 100 Ω
100
 
Ω
resistor and a 910kΩ
910
k
Ω
resistor. The analogue pin measures still a correct value for the supply voltage U0
U
0
because the first resistor is negligible small compared to the second resistor. We did not connect the analogue pin directly with the power supply to prevent the micro controller from damage in case of a short circuit or a peak voltage caused by an other component of the overall device. The micro controller measures the supply voltage 50 times with a delay time of 50 ms between measurements. It calculates the average of U0
U
0
and the empirical standard deviation σU0
σ
U
0
in percent, which is used as measurement uncertainty for further calculations.
To initiate a resistance measurement of the LDR the LED needs to be turned on by setting a digital output pin to 5 V. An additional green LED on the device is turned on as well to indicate that a measurement is taking place. After a waiting time of 30 s the actual measurement starts. This waiting time was determined empirically and is required because of the slow response of the LDR. ULDR
U

is measured as U0

As a first proof of principle we measured a kinetic curve of Cas13a digesting RNaseAlert. For a negative control we measured a kinetic curve for Cas13a without target RNA. and for a positive control we digested RNaseAlert with RNase A. We analysed the data with equation  [eq:k41] and  [eq:k42]. Image  [img:k4] shows fluorescence in equivalent fluorescein concentrations vs time. The time traces show an enzymatic reaction taking place on filter paper. This proves that our detector is sensitive enough for our application.
