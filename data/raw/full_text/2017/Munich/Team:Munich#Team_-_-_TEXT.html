Supervisors
Aurore Dupin
PhD student on synthetic circuits
She comes from France, studied at the ENS Cachan and got her Master in Chemistry from the UPMC in Paris. Currently, she is a PhD student in the field of synthetic biology and is working on spatially organized synthetic circuits. At the beginning of our lab work, she trained us in key experiments like cloning and RNA isolation. We can confirm that she is a very patient supervisor, always with a nice answer even after asking her several times the same questions.
Lukas Aufinger
PhD student on cell-free gene expression
He studied Physics and Biophysics at TUM. Before serious science got in the middle of his life, he used to do long jump. Now in his free time, he goes hiking and climbing. He has no clue about cloning, but is always willing to help us with any problem we have. He gives us advice on hardware and is always pushing us to learn new things outside the biologists’ comfort zone.
Benjamin Aleritsch
PhD student on cellular computers
He studied Aircraft-Engineering and got his Master in Physics at the LMU. Now, as a PhD student, he is attempting to build a Turing-capable computer in a living cell, which expanded his skills to microbiology and genetics. He is an IT- and Tech-Guru that can build anything. For that reason, he gives us advice in different fields like hardware, software, and web design. He's a heavy metal hearted nature-boy that has finished the Ironman twice in the two years past. His next goal: to cycle up to Mauna Kea's summit.
Michael Heymann
Post-doc at the Max Plank Institute for Biochemistry
He studied Biology and Biophysics in Berlin and Boston and now spends his days watching liquids flow down microfluidic channels to study dynamic biological systems. He is a fan of 3D printing big and small things and when he is not riding a bicycle, he likes to spend his vacations to spray nanocrystals in big free-electron lasers. Whenever he is around he is helping us understand and solve plumbing problems for our project.
Dong-Jiunn Jeffery Truong
PhD student developing Molecular Tools for Non-Invasive Imaging and Actuation
Jeff studied Molecular Biotechnology at TUM and is doing his PhD at the Helmholtz Zentrum München, where he is engineering molecular systems to control and observe cellular processes with different stimuli like light, magnetic fields, and sound. As an iGEM veteran, his experiences in the competition and the work dynamic have been very valuable, just like his knowledge in synthetic biology and biological engineering provided us with great ideas for our project.
