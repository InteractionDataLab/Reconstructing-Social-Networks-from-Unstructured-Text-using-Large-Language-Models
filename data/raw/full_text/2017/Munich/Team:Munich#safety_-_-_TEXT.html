Since our projectâ€™s ultimate goal is to diagnose infectious diseases, we thoroughly addressed safety aspects of our work. Originally we had an intention to work with saliva samples, but since our lab has S1 biosafety level, we had to find another solution. So we decided to obtain RNA of non-pathogenic parts of Bacillus subtilis, Norovirus and Hepatitis C virus by method of in vitro transcription. Besides that we work with E.coli only.
More details about regulations and law can be found in our Safety Form .
