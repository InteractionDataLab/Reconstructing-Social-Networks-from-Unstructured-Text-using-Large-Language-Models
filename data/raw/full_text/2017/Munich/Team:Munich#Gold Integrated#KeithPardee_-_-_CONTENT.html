align="left" valign="center"><H3>Regarding our project</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">What do you think about the problem of antibiotic resistance and the ways to prevent
it?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: We should continue to advocate responsible use for antibiotics in agriculture and medicine.  With low cost and accessible tools like your team is building, it may be possible to identify antibiotic resistance early on and enable better containment and patient treatment.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">We have some problems getting the Cas13a lyophilized into paper. Do you have any
low-cost suggestion for us?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: An interesting new paper (Karig et al., 2017) uses trehalose as a cryoprotectant for cell free-reactions. The trehalose is present in organisms like tardigrades (water bears) and helps to preserve protein stability while samples are dry or at elevated temperatures.
</P></TD></TR><TR class="lastRow"><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">Did you ever considered using as a colorimetric readout such as gold nanoparticles?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: I think gold nanoparticles are an interesting option for colorimetric outputs and you can borrow much from what has already been done.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="left" valign="center"><H3>Regarding his recent study <A class="myLink" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416305050">(Pardee et al., 2016)</A></H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">We read your paper from last year titled “Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Zika Virus Using
Programmable Biomolecular Components” and we wanted to know, what led you to
use β-galactosidase as a colored readout?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: One of the reasons was because of the potential for enzyme activity to amplify the output signal. 
Unlike fluorescent reporters (e.g. GFP), a single molecule of enzyme reporter can churn through substrate to create many molecules of color (chlorophenol red). The other reason was even more practical. With the use of a color-based system, the diagnostic processes occurring at the molecular level on paper can be determined with the naked eye. Therefore in low resource settings there is no need for UV lights, electronics and camera.</P></TD></TR><TR class="lastRow"><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">What was your motivation to build that detector on your study?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: The electronic optical reader developed by Tom Ferrante allows users to track multiple reactions at the same time. The reader also introduces the potential for quantification. These processes are semi-quantitative and so with this information you can start to interpret your data as more than just positive or negative for a pathogen. At this time, we don’t have the precision to determine the exact concentration of your pathogen (e.g. Zika virus), but you may be able to say this is a high titer or a low titer individual. Also, user accessibility, if you can automate the reading of tests, as in digital pregnancy tests, you can make it easier for users.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="4" align="left" valign="center"><H3>Regarding the Synthetic Biology field</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="4" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">What difference can Synthetic Biology bring to the world? How significant or relevant
can it be for future generations?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>:  As synthetic biologists we have a responsibility to be transparent and to actively communicate with the public. We cannot wait for the public to come to us, instead we need to ensure that the public knows what we are doing and why we are doing it.  This will help to prevent misunderstandings and rejection of technologies, like we have seen with genetically modified plants in parts of the world.
</P><P>
Synthetic Biology has incredible potential to solve a lot of the big challenges of the day and I think probably the biggest one is inequity. In Canada, where I live, we are fortunate to have access to high-quality food and health care and sufficient energy, but unfortunately this is not the case in many parts of the world. I think that synthetic biology and biological engineering (and science in general) can serve to correct this inequality by creating low cost, accessible technologies.
</P><P>
The work that we are doing in our lab is focused on improving access to health care. Using cell-free technologies that are biosafe, we are developing low cost diagnostics and platforms for the manufacture of protein-based therapeutics, like vaccines. There are many other ways to use Synthetic Biology, and the nice part, from a scientist’s perspective, is that we are in early days and the space is wide open. So you can pursue whatever drives you and see where your creativity takes you. That´s exciting.

severity and area of research. Do you think this should change and if yes how could we
overcome the ethical issues better?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: Scientists actively support practices of containment of GMOs during the development of technologies and the evaluation of safety. Policies are doing what they were intended to do and researchers follow them. But I am aware that some people are concerned about GMOS and in some cases, there is potential, just like any technology, for misuse. I think the benefits of the potential for biotechnologies vastly outweigh the risks when they are used in a well thought out regulatory framework. Again it is important to communicate with the public. Just like other big issues of our time (e.g. climate change, vaccine safety) it is facts, in lockstep with responsible use, that really needs to drive policy, fact-based policy is key.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="4" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">What is your opinion on the Bio-Hacking movement? (The people that are trying to
bring synthetic biology to homes)
</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: I think it´s exciting, distributed thinking, engaging young people and others keen to solve problems is great. We don’t need all solutions to come from institutions or companies. Think about how Apple or Microsoft started.  But there are risks and so there needs to be regulations. For example, what are the DNA sequences being synthesized?

detection systems, the ability to detect anything (mutations in your genome, HIV
infection, paternity, etc.) Should it be used by individuals, in their home, for detecting
pathogens or conducting different biological tests? What would be your personal
concerns regarding this?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: I think the practical path forward is to extend the capability that is currently limited to clinical labs and hospitals, out to patients in a more distributed model. The first step might be the doctor´s office or the pharmacy. I could see it going further out to veterinarians and doctors in developing environments and rural hospitals.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">Do you think there should be any limitations regarding the use of these types of
devices?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: Technology must be accompanied with regulations and consideration for the social implications. There are lots of places where portable testing for pathogens could do a lot of good, especially in low and middle-income countries.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><P><B class="interviewQuestion">What are the future perspectives of Synthetic Biology in your opinion?</B><I>Dr. Pardee</I>: : I am super excited about the future of Synthetic Biology and Bio-engineering. With continued and growing support from funding agencies, this is going to be an amazing field to be a scientist and there is a lot of potential to bring real benefits to the world. To think that you can use biology to transform carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. into sensors, materials and therapeutics with what are essentially self-replicating machines is amazing and has the potential to catalyze incredible change.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" align="center" valign="center"><H3>References</H3><P><OL style="text-align: left"><LI id="ref_9">Karig, David, et al. &quot;Preservation of protein expression systems at elevated temperatures for portable therapeutic production.&quot; Journal of the Royal Society Interface 14.129 (2017): 20161039.</LI><LI id="ref_5">Pardee, Keith, et al. &quot;Rapid, low-cost detection of Zika virus using programmable biomolecular components.&quot; Cell 165.5 (2016): 1255-1266.</LI></OL></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
