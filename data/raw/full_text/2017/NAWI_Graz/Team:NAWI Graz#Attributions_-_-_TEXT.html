The success of our project was due to the great work of many people. First of all, the idea came from our colleague Monika             Pranjic, who was working with this project due to her project lab together with other colleagues - Daniel Moser,             Martin Stefanec, Daniel Nicolas Hofstadler, Ingo Sequens and Nico Teuschler.. As a lot of technical and computational             knowledge was prerequisite to execute our project, we decided to join our teams together to form the iGEM Team             NAWI_Graz 2017.
