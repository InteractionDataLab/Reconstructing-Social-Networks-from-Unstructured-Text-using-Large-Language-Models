BIOREACTOR
In order to habitate our ‘
strain’, a bioreactor was needed offering optimal conditions. Magnetic stirring, a thermostat and a construction that keeps the optical density of the bacterial culture in range, had to be built.
Ports on top of the reactor bottle
Temperature Sensor: Opening for a glass tube with a temperature sensor suspended in distilled water
pH Sensor: Wide opening for the pH-Sensor (DFRobot pH sensor)
Port 1: Silicone tubing inlet for dilution of the reactor medium, from a peristaltic pump that                     pumped fresh sterile medium
Port 2: Glass tubing that reached to the bottom of the reactor bottle used to pump out medium for                     OD measuring
Port 3: Inlet for silicone tubing (acidic solution)
Port 4: Inlet for silicone tubing (basic solution)
Port 5: Silicone tubing outlet - the tubing was placed deep inside the reactor bottle used to pump                     out medium to the heating block and the fluorescence chamber

OD Maintenance
To keep the optical density of the reactor medium at values that are beneficial for good fluorescence signals, an "OD maintenance             system" was built. This consists of two arduinos, an H-bridge module, two peristaltic pumps, a bottle with sterile             medium and a waste bottle. The setup uses two "Arduino nanos" - one measuring the OD and the other controlling             the peristaltic pumps.
OD Measuring Device
The OD measuring device was built by 3D-printing a case that surrounds a regular UV-cuvette. This case has an opening on             one side for the 600 nm LED and on the other side for the light-sensor. A hole was drilled into the bottom of the             UV-cuvette and sillicone tubing was fitted inside. The tubing was sealed with 2-compound glue to be air-tight.             A 3D-printed cap was put on top of the casing that also had a hole for a second piece of silicone tubing. To             protect the OD-chamber from any outside light, another case was modeled and 3D-printed. The OD-chamber was fitted             inside this white chamber and cables and tubing were glued to it.
Fig. 2: The parts that were used to assemble the OD-measuring chamber.
The assembled OD-case can be seen in figure 3. Inside one of the openings, a LED with approximately 600 nm and in the other opening, a light sensor (“TSL 235R-sensor”) was placed             at the side and the light sensor (“TSL 235R-sensor”) inside the other opening. An isolation tape was wrapped around             the OD-chamber to keep everything in place and to protect the sensor from outside light.

OD Maintenance Set-Up
Hardware:
Pump 1: Used to pump out medium from the reactor bottle into the OD-chamber and finally to the                         waste bottle
Pump 2: Used to dilute the reactor medium with fresh sterile medium, if required
Pump 3: Used to pump out reactor medium through the heating block and the fluorescence chamber                         into another waste bottle
Arduino 1: Arduino controlling the H-Bridge module that had the peristaltic pumps attached
Arduino 2: Arduino running the OD-measuring code, sending GPIO signals to Arduino 1, if necessary
Fig. 5: Top view of the whole OD-maintenance setup. A bottle of fresh sterile medium and a waste bottle                 were connected to the peristaltic pumps 1 and 2.
Arduino 2 was used to run the "Aachen final.ino", an Arduino code used by the 2015 iGEM team Aachen to measure the optical                 density of a medium with the "TSL 235R-sensor". Before use, the system had to be calibrated with samples                 of a known OD (measured with a laboratory OD-device). The output value was transformed into real OD-values                 for better control of the experiment. Then a "switch case" code was written using this output value to                 decide whether fresh medium was needed to dilute the reactor medium or if a defined pause was required for                 the next measuring cycle. The Arduino 2 communicated with Arduino 1 via GPIO signals.
For a measuring cycle the coding on the Arduino 1 was designed as follow: After 20 minutes had passed, a small amount of                 medium was pumped out of the reactor and through the OD-chamber from below. Then a 5 second delay was used                 for any bubbles inside the chamber to dissociate. A delay ensured Arduino 2 to measure the optical density                 in the meantime. Then the code was waiting for GPIO signals of Arduino 2 that triggered the pump 2 if necessary.                 Our experiments showed that the optimal optical density for proper fluorescence signals was at an OD600 of 0.3.                 The OD-maintenance system was set to this value and was able to keep the OD600 at ~ 0.3 over a long period of                 time (or until there was no fresh medium left). Whenever an OD600 bigger than 0.3 was reached, approximately 5 ml of fresh                 sterile medium was pumped into the reactor bottle.
One problem that came up was that the liquid level inside the reactor bottle - it should stay the constant over longer periods of                 time. Since liquid was pumped out of the reactor bottle every 20 minutes for OD and fluorescence measurements by the other pump, the liquid levels dropped relatively fast and the reactor bottle was empty pretty                 quick in first trials. The solution was to measure the volumes transferred by the peristaltic pumps for specific                 running times. Then it was possible to adjust the liquid level inside the reactor bottle by changing the                 Arduino code since the estimated volumes were known. Every pumped out volume of reactor medium was replaced                 with the same amount of fresh sterile medium after this adjustment.
Thermostat
Thermostat including a heating mat and a temperature sensor - for the maintenance of the optimal temperature inside the reactor bottle, a basic thermostat system was built:
Arduino nano: Running a temperature measuring code (DallasTemperature.h and OneWire.h)
DS18B20 digital temperature sensor: Placed inside a glass tube that was inserted inside the reactor                         bottle and filled with distilled water. The glass tube was built by melting the opening of a glass                         burette over a bunsen burner until it was closed and air-tight
12W heating mat: Stuck on a small piece of aluminium and placed beneath the reactor bottle
Relay module: Suited for common microcontrollers
The relay module and the heating mat was connected to a 12V energy source. The controller pins of the relay module were triggered                 by the arduino nano, whenever the inside temperature of the reactor medium went higher than 30°C. This caused                 the relay module to stop the energy supply to the heating mat. Several test runs showed that this set-up                 holds the inside temperature between 29°C and 30°C which was sufficient for our purposes.
Fig. 6: The basic set-up for thermostat of the reactor medium. The heating mat kept the temperature                 of the reactor medium roughly at 30°C. Since magnetic stirring was used the temperature swings were minimal.
