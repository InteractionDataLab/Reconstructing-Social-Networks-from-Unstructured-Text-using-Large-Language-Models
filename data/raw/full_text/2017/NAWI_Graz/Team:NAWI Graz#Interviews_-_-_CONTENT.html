                                    Great and innovative, basic experiments are very straight forward. I am looking forward to seeing how it will transfer to
                                    the informatics part. There is a lot of potential in it. Microorganisms are normally
                                    not &quot;bit-like&quot;, they are normally not reacting with a yes or no. And another big chance
                                    is in the area of modified response. Like when our liver gets in contact with a hormone,
                                    which makes it produce some enzymes e.g. for digestion, not all cells react at the same
                                    time, some start earlier some start later, which is very important. I think there is
                                    a big chance that you can get temporary response in that way.

                                    too fast. Especially in gene technology, thinking of gene therapy, it was predicted,
                                    that we will win against all genetic diseases plus cancer. But it does take longer than

                                    But maybe you can also think about specified organisms, maybe oxygen in the air for aerobic

                                    It is a big problem. We are falling behind, since there is this mistrust in genes. Just think about the fact that things
                                    are labeled gene free, it has created a very bad atmosphere towards such a promising
                                    technology. As I said before, I think the future lies in biotechnology and genetic modification.
                                    The funny thing is, that if you modify organisms blindly by radiation or cross two species
                                    that is defined as natural and the result is good, but if a scientist takes a certain
                                    gene and puts it into an organism, it must be bad and it must be financed by Monsanto.
                                    Another important thing to think about, is why are there just big companies like Monsanto,
                                    which have monopoles in this field. It is because of the laws and the controls are so
                                    strict that a small company has no chance to afford that. I was quite shocked when the

                                    What comes first to my mind is a very well defined biological system, which in general is very well characterized and sometimes

                                    Safety guidelines are always an important issue. One of the main issues is that since genetically engineering is used (for
                                    about 40 years) no serious accident has happened, where the use of gene technology was
                                    the reason for an accident. And the reason for that is that guidelines for a safe use

                                    also have to provide the rules on how to use it. Because with gene technology you also
                                    have the problem that you can enter areas where there are some risks too.

                                    I think the iGEM guidelines support a very safe working area. Because of course, if students do not have a long experience,
                                    they do not know which areas are risky and what areas can be handled in a safe manner.
                                    And such guidelines provide this information for the students. From this point of view,
                                    I think it is a very good set-up, but on the other hand it is important that young students
                                    learn to work with such techniques under safe conditions. So in combination with the
                                    proper guidelines, there should not be a risk that the students would have any problems.

                                    None, none at all. So from the point of view of biological safety, I see no risk whatsoever behind it and I mean the organisms
                                    that are bred in it are, so to speak, pets and according to certain measures it is handled
                                    accordingly. It is a closed system so I would not associate any risks.

                                    So as you have described, it is a huge opportunity, because you could practically extremely expand the computing power through
                                    parallelism. That is a huge potential, when it works (laughs). Otherwise, I see a huge
                                    potential for microorganisms in connection with biotechnology or technology as a whole.
                                    If we remember that maybe we only know one percent of microorganisms that exist globally
                                    at the moment, there is still an inexhaustible potential. In my opinion, the greatest
                                    potential lies in the generation of alternative energies, since above all the conversion
                                    of solar energy. The photosynthetically active microorganisms offer a very large potential,
                                    although there the development proceeds relatively slowly, but I think that has only
                                    something to do with investment. Too little investment in the field. And the second is
                                    that I believe that the problem of climate change will not be solved without microorganisms,
                                    without knowledge and without commitment. These are actually the two.

                                    No, I can answer that with a clear no. I can not believe it. I rather believe that this is a social-political problem, that
                                    the worlds hunger is related to the stabilization of economies and inequality in distribution,
                                    which, in my opinion, is still the main problem for hunger. What will be certain in the
                                    future is that due to the climate change, certain areas of cultivation may be restricted
                                    and that the genetic engineering provides the opportunity to produce crops that can be
                                    successfully used, for example, in dry areas. Here I already see potential and a possibility.
                                    But that it actually wipes the hunger from the world, the genetically modified plants
                                    certainly will not. Nevertheless, the problem of the world remains open, since the use
                                    of genetically modified plants gives rise to monopole. This is again a social-political
                                    and economic-political problem. This has little to do with technology and science. One
                                    can not solve the other now. It needs a social dialogue that brings this together and
                                    regulates it.

                                    My name is Gabriele Berg and I come from Germany, but I have been in the Austrian Chair for Environmental Biotechnology at
                                    Graz University of Technology for 12 years. In our research we are involved with microbiomes,
                                    in a specific place or in a particular organism. On the one hand we investigate these
                                    things and on the other hand we also try to transfer new knowledge into application,
                                    like biotechnological applications.

                                    So if I am honest, then I would first think of great potential for research, secondly difficulties in the application and
                                    I would immediately encounter hurdles in the registry. As a third point I would gladly
                                    mention that it is of course an infinite natural diversity of microorganisms from which
                                    we have only really understood and analyzed a very small percentage so far. In this respect
                                    from 25 years of research experience, my conclusion is that diversity is the most important
                                    and I would rather have a look, if I could also find the potential in this natural variety.

                                    I really find this extremely exciting and innovative. We ourselves try to do so. We try to connect the technique with the
                                    microbiome, with the microbiology. I believe that there is really an unimaginable potential
                                    that we cannot imagine, so I find it very good that you are dealing with it, even if
                                    it is now, so to speak, the interaction between a robot and a microorganism, but I find
                                    that is a very good and exciting application.

                                    In principle, we carry risks all the time and, of course, also such a project, so in this aspect it is always important to
                                    weigh which risks are bigger or which risks are more dangerous. I think in this case,
                                    of course, the robot could somehow have a problem and the genetically modified MOs might
                                    be leaky. Genetically engineered MOs are not automatically dangerous. It strongly depends
                                    on the specific transgenes they carry, which promoters are in there, so there is actually
                                    a much more detailed evaluation necessary to make any statement. And there are also many
                                    MOs which are little risky and nature makes it happen. Always a major risk point of transgenic
                                    organisms is that the transgene migrates from one organism to the other. In nature it
                                    happens permanently and perhaps is a good example. We carry 2 kg of MOs inside us, so
                                    it would be natural that the robot follows the holobiontics concept and carries MOs in
                                    itself. However, I would argue for more diversity.

                                    In the last few years we have noticed that microbiomes are severely impoverished in their diversity, both in humans and in
                                    the high-performance animals and plants, so a future field is surely the microbiome engineering

                                    learn very much and it is far from its later field of application, namely the right research,
                                    and the sooner you get in touch with this research, the better it is to estimate whether

                                    they are statistically significant or not. So, there are always risks, but I also think
                                    it is important to gain experience.

                                    The ultimate solution certainly not, because there is no black and white here. I would imagine that it makes sense for certain
                                    regions or for different plants, but overall it is really important to preserve the diversity
                                    of our crops. We have a lot of cultivar adapted to the specific conditions of the ground
                                    and I am personally worried about the fact, that developing countries in particular may
                                    not have the right seeds from the corresponding crops. For example, we have a project
                                    with Africa. It is all about healthy vegetables and you cannot imagine how difficult
                                    it was to organize vegetable seeds at all. We have other problems as well. When talking
                                    about genetically modified MOs, it must always be considered in detail, who will use
                                    them, which property will be transferred. Of course, much of this is herbicide tolerance
                                    now. So a detailed look is necessary. It certainly is not the ultimate solution.

                                    I am professor for microbiology at the Karl-Franzens University of Graz and I work at the Institute of Molecular Biosciences.
                                    I participate in research and teaching. As chairman of the curricula commission I am
                                    also responsible for studies. The scientific field which I am working on at the moment
                                    is HTG (horizontal gene transfer). I research how molecular genes are transmitted through,
                                    so-called bacterial conjugation. This plays a role in the medical field, in the transmission
                                    of antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, I am examining molecular regulatory mechanisms
                                    in bacterial population. Not all organisms of a population express DNA transfer genes,
                                    so there is also a variety. On the other hand I am working together with the Institute
                                    of Applied Geosciences. We are investigating the phenomenon that in concrete structures,
                                    within a few years, the construction is eaten by bacteria that settle there and thereby
                                    destroy the sewage system. Since this is very costly, we are looking for new materials
                                    which are not attackable by the bacteria.

                                    There is great potential in the field of the MOs. Whereby I believe that we do not yet know, which variety of bacteria and
                                    archaea is present and what possibilities we have to use this variety, e.g. in biotechnological
                                    processes. First we have to identify genes that are suitable for the production of certain
                                    substances. We would also have to genetically modulate MOs to take full advantage of
                                    the existing potential. I am also thinking about bioremediation - environmental detoxification
                                    by MOs. On poisonous waste dumps we can find bacteria and MOs which can degrade these
                                    substances. It is also about recognizing what is there and then trying to use these organisms
                                    also purposefully.

                                    I think that your experiment is very exciting. And that a linkage between a biological and a technical system can make a
                                    lot of sense, since certain sensor systems are present in some MOs. They are very sensitive,
                                    one can directly couple many changes in the organism, such as e.g. in your case with
                                    movement. What also stands in the foreground is the work in the laboratory, and the attempt
                                    to really implement this idea and you will see how difficult it is to implement ideas
                                    that you have.

                                    I cannot imagine anything specific yet, but the possibility to connect a biological system with a purely technical system
                                    is very exciting. I think that the knowledge, which can be gained from this research,

                                    At this point, it must be said that regulatory mechanisms in bacteria are very diverse. It is often thought that bacteria
                                    are very simple creatures, but it must be mentioned that highly complex regulation mechanisms
                                    are present in bacteria. If you only think of the quorum sensing, they perceive how many
                                    of their species are around in their environment or where there is food. They also record
                                    temperature changes and many other special signal paths are available. I could imagine
                                    for example a quorum sensing system to control a process. In addition, there is heterogeneity
                                    within a population. There is also some sort of division of work within a population,
                                    some cells have certain functions.

                                    What do you think about the general legal position of genetic engineering in Austria

                                    The legal basis is sufficient in my opinion and would also allow the release of genetically modified plants that would be
                                    useful in agriculture. As far as I know, there has never been a release attempt in Austria.
                                    While the legal basis is clear, it does not seem politically feasible for research to
                                    be conducted in this direction in Austria either. In my opinion, the existing potential
                                    is very large. However, the focus is mainly on the dangers. But at least in medicine,
                                    genetic engineering is gaining greater acceptance, presumably because of the hope for
                                    a longer and healthier life. A greater danger is actually e.g. the addition of antibiotics
                                    in food. The risks of genetically modified plants are overestimated in comparison.

                                    genetically engineered organisms. Of course, it was a hard way to achieve this, because
                                    we were a group of students of molecular biology, who shared the idea to have our own
                                    laboratory, for working on our own ideas. We wanted to work on creative ideas and not
                                    be restricted with some bureaucracy or financial problems, which can occur at the universities.
                                    And that is why we said that we want our own space, to work on our own ideas and create
                                    what we think would be right for us. So, we searched for people who are interested in
                                    this idea and we created this laboratory on our own. We had no funders and did everything
                                    by our own. Now we are like a hackerspace, where technology and biology are connected
                                    at some point. This laboratory is open for everybody, who is interested in molecular
                                    biology and other related science disciplines.

                                    should not restrict any kind of scientists, who want to work with them, but it should
                                    be clear that genetically modified organisms are used for scientific purposes and not

                                    I think it is very good. I think this strongly promotes the idea that students can touch, learn and applicate new things
                                    by themselves, because the universities have unfortunately not so much space for creativity.
                                    Therefore iGEM is a very good exercise to progress, learn and perhaps also start a company.
                                    I believe that iGEM has definitely built something and it provides more publicity for
                                    synthetic biology and genetic engineering. I think it is great that you get challenged

Through my training I have no means to tell, whether this is too dangerous or not. I have never been dealing with ethics in my studies and I cannot calculate the risks in any numerical way. What I know is, that living systems are always self-organized systems. There is a lot of microscopic processes going on inside of a life form and then you will see emerging phenomena arising from that and they are basically unpredictable beforehand. If you play around with the genetic code of organisms, there is a danger that you change those microscopic processes and that something you did not expect will appear. Whether this is dangerous or not, is something that I cannot answer, but it is something that you should be aware of. Yes, it is our job as scientists to push the door wide open and gather all knowledge we can gather. It is then the job of regulators and politicians to create frameworks to prevent potential risks from happening.

So, what I said in my previous answer was, that it is very difficult to predict the emerging phenomena. They might be surprisingly welcome, or they might be surprisingly dangerous. Both is possible, and I personally lack the data, which is more likely than the other, but there will be surprises, and this can be on the good side or will fall on the bad side. Concerning technology assessment, following the same line is a very bad idea to even believe that something like that is possible and useful. If I build a bomb or if I build a killer virus, I do not need to study technology assessment to tell that this is not a good idea and that this is dangerous. So whenever it is obvious, I can easily tell. The only interesting part is, when this is not obvious - how should I tell if a technology becomes dangerous in the future - especially when it is cross effected by other technologies that are not known today, but will only be known in 10, 50, 100 years. My classical example is the invention of the telephone. Today smart-phone private based taxi drivers might render classical taxi drivers jobless and put them at higher social risk. Still it would be ridiculous to blame the invention of the telephone hundred something years ago for lowering the life quality of taxi drivers today. You can, in principle, not predict what will come from a technology that is invented today. It is in principle impossible to accept in some obvious cases, where we do not need technology assessments, that is like common knowledge and some basic thinking that can give you an answer.

                                    Different technology fields, well genetically modified organisms are probably a little bit more dangerous than classical
                                    mechatronic devices, because there is this additional feature of reproduction that every
                                    living organism has and in reproduction there is potential spread and in potential spread
                                    there is potential danger, so I would rank them always one level higher in the danger
                                    level then mechatronic or electronic developments.

                      A relative simple one compared to other technologies. I say this one is more likely to become dangerous than another once - yes - but not in a way like it is normally understood. I cannot tell today, whether I should invest time into this invention or not, because there might be something dangerous coming out of it. That is strictly not foreseeable. You suggest just to explore all the new technologies to a certain point and then think about the implications or to which point to go. For example, with GMOs, is it a good idea to do the studies behind closed doors to try not to get modified organisms out? Having secure laboratories is a prerequisite, but I think this is how it is done everywhere in the world and there are standards. Of course, these standards are important. For me the question is more, should I deeply understand those organisms, and should I understand them so deeply that I can reprogram them? And this is the tricky question, because if I fully understand them, of course I can unlock a lot of potential, but I also can unlock a lot of harm and this is the old question in this discussion. Should I then seek for this understanding or should I not? It is not about lab standards or stuff like that. I think this is out of dispute.

But you already do that to some extend when you say that there is a potential risks, when something is able to self-replicate and spread. Why is that not already some sort of technology assessment?

                                    like that, I mean this is trivial and I think this is what farmers did since centuries.
                                    When they were encountering, I do not know some investigation with some parasites or
                                    some diseases in their animals that they try to separate and prevent the spreading and
                                    so on. I hope for myself, this is trivial for me. The real question is, should we open
                                    the door and look inside or should we not? This is a tricky question and this
                                    is an ethical philosophical question that cannot be countered by lab doors I think.
                                    It is a start with the idea, with an idea of a new technology. Yes, probably yes, that
                                    is why I am being in favor of opening the door, because we scientists should seek for knowledge
                                    and this is the higher gain and then we should have regulations and politics around that
                                    and forbid any abuse of that and try to prevent most of the abuse of it. This is us
                                    job as scientists, that we gather knowledge and we are aware that this is a dangerous
                                    thing that we are doing.

                                    topic maybe. In your introduction you said that you founded the Artificial Life Laboratory.
                                    What were your intentions when you founded it, what goals do you have?
</H4></A><DIV id="ic87" class="collapse" role="tabpanel"><P class="interview-answer mb-3">

                                    So, I like the concept of understanding life. What makes a living thing different from a non-living thing? One way
                                    to approach this is to try to create, as a farfetched goal, something which is lifelike
                                    or living from scratch, because the basic idea is, if you can build it you have understood
                                    it. So, having this farfetched goal which we probably will never achieve in our lifetime,
                                    we search for the building blocks to build such an artificial life form. These building
                                    blocks contain understanding, to get those building blocks, we must understand
                                    it, but by bit, how life works, how it functions, what life is. Therefore, I like this
                                    overhaul goal of artificial life. Sometimes, it is worded, also in a different way that
                                    we seek for life. Not how it is, but how it can be. So, we are searching for alternative
                                    forms of life. Also, this is a very interesting goal, because it brings you to a different
                                    perspective where you see the more general principles of life. If you are too much focused
                                    on the life that we see on our earth, then we can be maybe over focused and general enough
                                    and this might prevent a more general understanding of life.

There is a new field emerging in science called synthetic
                                    biology, where organisms are created artificially, where whole genomes are put into existing
                                    cells and changing the bacteria as it used to be. Do you think that this sort of new
                                    synthetic biology can be called artificial life?
</H4></A><DIV id="ic88" class="collapse" role="tabpanel"><P class="interview-answer mb-3">

                                   It is called artificial life. It is not seeking for an answer to the question, how life can be in all its variants.
                                    It is very much focused on the life that we know on earth. It is built from this knowledge
                                    that was gained. I do not know how much we will learn from that. Maybe, it is of practical
                                    interest for not only genetically modified organisms, but also for morphologically and
                                    physiologically modified organism. Maybe, it is the next step of practical applications,
                                    but I doubt that we will learn much new things about life in general. If I compare it,
                                    to building a house for example, it is like I have a house to build from concrete and
                                    wood and some glass windows and I remove them and then I go somewhere and bring new glass
                                    windows, new concrete and new wooden parts and would build this house again. I build
                                    this house from scratch. What I am interested in more, is how could I build a house from
                                    water for example, what would I have to do and is it still a house? And by doing so,
                                    I learn more about the house. What makes a house a house and not just like?
                                    rebuilding, what is already known.

  As I said, it is a very open field. There can be any form that fulfills some basic requirements of life, what is a discussion
                                    itself, which I will not start here. For example, reproduction, inheritance and evolution
                                    over time are important. But also, self-repair and self-sustainability of these organisms
                                    are important. And it can come in various forms and the most likely form that we will
                                    encounter is, of course, robots. We see a quantum leap in robotics today, ranging from
                                    autonomous cars over legged robots, very small robot swarms. So, robotics is a booming
                                    field and in addition to that, we see artificial intelligence, adaptive algorithms but
                                    also, software is having sort of a quantum leap and maybe even material science will have
                                    a quantum leap soon with this graphene project and so on. Batteries will have a quantum
                                    leap and computation. Maybe, with quantum computers we will have a real quantum
                                    leap. So, bringing all this thing together, it is very likely that in 10 till 20 years,
                                    we will have machines, which are in discriminable from humans for example and definitely
                                    we are life forms - and machines that are not discriminable from ourselves, will they
                                    also, be life forms or not?

                                    if you go from microscopic point of view, if we change the dna, change the nucleotides,
                                    that are the building blocks of the dna to something completely different and we would
                                    still receive something that fulfils the requirements that we call it life, would you
                                    then call it artificial life?</H4></A><DIV id="ic810" class="collapse" role="tabpanel"><P class="interview-answer mb-3">

                                    It is an artificial life that these people are doing. The question is, how interesting it is and how much we will learn from
                                    that, that we could not learn in another way? For me, another important step is that
                                    these are all unicellular organisms. They might be interesting, but they cannot do much.
                                    So real work is not achieved by unicellular organisms. They produce substances, maybe
                                    they can even change their color or emit light or something like that. But for example,
                                    if I compare this to a robot, there is no work that can be done by these organisms. A
                                    classical application for a robot is to wash my dishes and clean my house, and another
                                    one would be maybe for safeguarding my house against thieves or something like that and
                                    none by these features can be done by unicellular organisms. Not even billions of unicellular
                                    organism will ever bring my dishes from the table to the dishwasher and put them into
                                    the cupboard afterwards. That is basically not possible. So, when we look at life, I
                                    think we must discriminate between green slime and what we usually comprehend as life,
                                    which are higher plants and higher animals and there is a huge difference in the work
                                    they can do. Artificial life, maybe, can be seen also along this line, so we
                                    have one branch, which maybe can produce insulin very cheaply or very efficiently and
                                    we have another line of artificial life, mostly mimicking multicellular higher animals,
                                    sometimes also plants. They can achieve real work and do maybe much more interesting
                                    and helpful things for humans, except building chemical substances.

                                    I think, it is a robotic idea that we also once had, but it never made it into a proposal or something like that. It is rather
                                    obvious what you want to have. There is a sort of autonomous robot and if you go to the
                                    very end of the line of an autonomous robot, you have an artificial animal and such an
                                    autonomous robot should collect plastic, rebuild itself because it is built from plastic.
                                    So, that it can collect more plastic and then of course collect even more plastic so
                                    this is the way how you would approach that. Yes, so you can probably take
                                    concepts of cell replication and so on, but if it really should achieve work, it needs
                                    muscles, it needs a nervous system, it needs the ability to create, it needs a sort of
                                    skeleton and joints to be able to apply force. Growth alone is probably not enough
                                    for achieving any of those tasks.

                                    get a little bit closer to biology again, because in the time in my lab they had to program
                                    a lot and work with engineering questions, what brought them maybe a little bit away
                                    from biology. And by now integrating those organisms into their artificial life forms
                                    they are partially creating, they must deal again with physiological aspects of unicellular

                                    some insight in how the scientific community works or how life as a scientist looks like
                                    and you must find an interesting topic that you can work on. On the one hand you have
                                    to find financial support for doing this and you must involve the public, whom you
                                    must tell in the end. I mean in most cases they pay, it is mostly taxpayer money,
                                    that we use, and we must explain to the public, what we are using their money for and
                                    why we use it this way and not in a different way and all those components are all part
                                    of this iGEM program or iGEM strategy, which is I think a very interesting part of learning
                                    how to do science and this is what I hope what my students learned.

                                    a scientist. You just talked about them. Maybe they are not really taught in universities.
                                    Is there a way to change that?</H4></A><DIV id="ic813" class="collapse" role="tabpanel"><P class="interview-answer mb-3">

                                    Should we change that? It is the job of university to teach knowledge and because many people go through a university, which
                                    do not end up as scientists. I do not have numbers, but I guess 90% of the people will
                                    do something else than science after their studies, so is it really the job of a university
                                    to teach also the life as a scientist? I think for this such projects like iGEM would
                                    be, I think a better solution.

                                    public relations, or team management could be used in a lot of jobs. Especially if you
                                    have finished a university degree. So maybe just transferring knowledge and no skills
                                    is not… I don’t know, do you think university should only transfer knowledge and no skills?

                                    No skills? I do not say no skills, but what you are referring to are social skills and of course social skills are important,
                                    but how to finance for example, how to gather financing for a specific study, something
                                    that in most cases scientists need, as soon as you go to a company you probably do not
                                    must search for that, because development will be paid by your company for example
                                    and if you become a teacher, then of course you do not have that and so on and so on,
                                    and you must look at the spectrum of things that people have to know. I would be afraid
                                    to bring universities too much into that field, where you just train for your job that
                                    you are going to do. This is what we have in Austria, so called “Fachhochschule”, and
                                    this is what they do, and I think universities should not become like that. University
                                    is a place for thinking and for most people university is a time in their life, where
                                    they spend on thinking in a way they will never do it again. It is a very special time
                                    period of your life and a very special place and this is how it should be. You can get
                                    your soft skills anywhere out there, does not mean you should not have any soft skills
                                    trained at university, but the main aspect of university should be thinking and promoting
                                    thinking, critical thinking, like rethinking what has been thought before and discussing
                                    and all of that there is little place in your work life for that and has nothing to do
                                    with soft skills. It is a special place and time in your life.

                                    so I got involved in robotics, came to the Artificial Life Lab in Graz to work on a project
                                    called SubCultron. We are making a swarm of robots to deploy in the Laguna of Venice
                                    to do some environmental monitoring and measurements which hopefully will lead to some
                                    more ecological policy changes.

                                    Definitely, definitely, so right now in our robots we have space occupied for computational hardware, so I would imagine

                                    yes, I would definitely see potential applications.

                                    I do not really see a such a risk, but I see a challenge. We would have to change the way we think about controlling, programming,
                                    paradigms that we have laid down for sequential processing. Until now we use CPUs and
                                    maybe when we talk about parallel processing we use GPUs, but we are still working very
                                    sequential.

                                    Definitely! If I look at how architectures are changing, and we are slowly moving towards this more parallel processing structures.
                                    GPUs already have a more parallel processing structure, but this might be a paradigm
                                    shift, where we cross the threshold to some kind of completely different architecture,
                                    if it is successfully implemented as a computer.

                                    So, if we look at the past few years and look at which areas have benefited from the increasing parallel processing, I would
                                    say there are two main areas that come quickly to my mind. There is a natural language
                                    processing and more widely known is computer vision or image processing. So I would expect
                                    that these fields would massively benefit from parallel processing. And talking about
                                    microorganisms that can be used as computers – they might become, for example, very,
                                    very good in understanding sounds. We are able to use Google Translate today because
                                    of convolutional neural networks that have gotten really good in understanding what we
                                    are speaking and any massively parallel system could implement a CNN to do the same things.
                                    So, I would expect these two fields to massively benefit from any massively parallel
                                    system.

                                    Yes, if we can dream. If I have a very small, strong computer, I can have an implant in my ear with a microphone and a speaker.
                                    If you then talk to me in German that processing unit can change that input signal into
                                    the language I understand and then I can speak back. That would be an application I could
                                    think of. If I want to do that today, I probably need a huge computer, at least in comparison
                                    to a microorganism based computer.

                                    But when we were actually starting using it, we actually saw that this is fine. That
                                    would be my approach, just do things that help people and then the society is going to
                                    understand. We always have, and we always have been growing over our natural inhibitions.
                                    And I think that genetically modified organisms will make a huge difference and people
                                    are going to see it.

                                    finding out what this potential is. GMOs are used for a lot of things nowadays, but as
                                    far as I know, they are rarely used to communicate with other systems. This is a thing
                                    we would like to change. We would like to show that GMOs are capable to communicate with
                                    other entities. We want to improve the existing way that GMOs are used for communication.
                                    The idea behind is that we do not only use GMOs for production, we use them also for
                                    communication, e.g. tell a user about the status or tell a machine what to do, to solve
                                    problems which usually can only be solved in very expensive ways by classical entities.
                                    GMOs have abilities that we miss in classical robots, e.g. they are very cheap to produce
                                    and reproduce, also regarding sensing they are able to detect substances and situations
                                    that are hardly detectable by detecting devices. We want to show that we can use GMOs
                                    for more things than just production.

                                    There is no new technology or no new machine you produce, that is completely without risks. First of all, what we use here
                                    is a life form, even if they are very small, and life forms do not react in a perfect
                                    determined way, they sometimes react different than you expect. The thing is, if you
                                    need a perfectly determined system, that reacts in a perfect way, still the classical
                                    silicon chip is the better solution, but if you give tolerance, than these kinds of processes
                                    are usable for you. The other thing discussed regarding MOs is what happens, if they
                                    get into the environment. The question is, can these modifications jump from one life
                                    form to another and what happens if they jump. I would not expect that the MOs do any
                                    harm, if they get into the environment. I can imagine that they lose their abilities
                                    pretty fast if released. But therefore, we have restrictions we should keep to.

                                    As mentioned before, GMOs as life forms have sensors for chemical substances, that go far beyond the technical sensors we
                                    use today. They are far better in detecting substances. The question is, if we can manage
                                    an interface between GMOs and machines that allows us to use e.g.
                                    <I>E. coli</I> as a sensor for something. We can also use GMOs as controller devices, however
                                    a big problem is the speed of the reaction. Usually people say there is no chance that
                                    you can use bacteria as processing devices, as they have comparatively long cycle lengths.
                                    We would need new algorithms that can run on a CPU, where thousands of single devices
                                    communicate to each other and calculate things. The real advantage might only show when
                                    we combine different kinds of bacteria and create a smart ecosystem of different GMOs.
                                    They might have different tasks, some might for example support or organize the others.

                                    I do not think that a microorganism based computer can replace our day-to-day computers. They are already established and
                                    proved themselves as useful. But there are special operation areas, where we would need
                                    massive parallel systems.
