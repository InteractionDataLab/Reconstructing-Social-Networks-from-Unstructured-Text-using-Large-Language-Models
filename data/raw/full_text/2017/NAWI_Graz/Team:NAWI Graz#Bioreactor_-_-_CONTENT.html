            To keep the optical density of the reactor medium at values that are beneficial for good fluorescence signals, an &quot;OD maintenance
            system&quot; was built. This consists of two arduinos, an H-bridge module, two peristaltic pumps, a bottle with sterile
            medium and a waste bottle. The setup uses two &quot;Arduino nanos&quot; - one measuring the OD and the other controlling
            the peristaltic pumps.
        </DIV><H3 class="section-sub-sub">OD Measuring Device</H3><DIV class="section-text container">
            The OD measuring device was built by 3D-printing a case that surrounds a regular UV-cuvette. This case has an opening on
            one side for the 600 nm LED and on the other side for the light-sensor. A hole was drilled into the bottom of the
            UV-cuvette and sillicone tubing was fitted inside. The tubing was sealed with 2-compound glue to be air-tight.
            A 3D-printed cap was put on top of the casing that also had a hole for a second piece of silicone tubing. To
            protect the OD-chamber from any outside light, another case was modeled and 3D-printed. The OD-chamber was fitted
            inside this white chamber and cables and tubing were glued to it.

            The assembled OD-case can be seen in figure 3. Inside one of the openings, a LED with approximately 600 nm and in the other opening, a light sensor (“TSL 235R-sensor”) was placed
            at the side and the light sensor (“TSL 235R-sensor”) inside the other opening. An isolation tape was wrapped around
            the OD-chamber to keep everything in place and to protect the sensor from outside light.

                Arduino 2 was used to run the &quot;Aachen final.ino&quot;, an Arduino code used by the <A href="https://2015.igem.org/Team:Aachen">2015 iGEM team Aachen</A> to measure the optical
                density of a medium with the &quot;TSL 235R-sensor&quot;. Before use, the system had to be calibrated with samples
                of a known OD (measured with a laboratory OD-device). The output value was transformed into real OD-values
                for better control of the experiment. Then a &quot;switch case&quot; code was written using this output value to
                decide whether fresh medium was needed to dilute the reactor medium or if a defined pause was required for
                the next measuring cycle. The Arduino 2 communicated with Arduino 1 via GPIO signals.
            </DIV><DIV class="section-text container">
                For a measuring cycle the coding on the Arduino 1 was designed as follow: After 20 minutes had passed, a small amount of
                medium was pumped out of the reactor and through the OD-chamber from below. Then a 5 second delay was used
                for any bubbles inside the chamber to dissociate. A delay ensured Arduino 2 to measure the optical density
                in the meantime. Then the code was waiting for GPIO signals of Arduino 2 that triggered the pump 2 if necessary.
                Our experiments showed that the optimal optical density for proper fluorescence signals was at an OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.3.
                The OD-maintenance system was set to this value and was able to keep the OD<SUB>600</SUB> at ~ 0.3 over a long period of
                time (or until there was no fresh medium left). Whenever an OD<SUB>600</SUB> bigger than 0.3 was reached, approximately 5 ml of fresh
                sterile medium was pumped into the reactor bottle.
            </DIV><DIV class="section-text container">
                One problem that came up was that the liquid level inside the reactor bottle - it should stay the constant over longer periods of
                time. Since liquid was pumped out of the reactor bottle every 20 minutes for OD and fluorescence measurements by the other pump, the liquid levels dropped relatively fast and the reactor bottle was empty pretty
                quick in first trials. The solution was to measure the volumes transferred by the peristaltic pumps for specific
                running times. Then it was possible to adjust the liquid level inside the reactor bottle by changing the
                Arduino code since the estimated volumes were known. Every pumped out volume of reactor medium was replaced
                with the same amount of fresh sterile medium after this adjustment.

                The relay module and the heating mat was connected to a 12V energy source. The controller pins of the relay module were triggered
                by the arduino nano, whenever the inside temperature of the reactor medium went higher than 30°C. This caused
                the relay module to stop the energy supply to the heating mat. Several test runs showed that this set-up
                holds the inside temperature between 29°C and 30°C which was sufficient for our purposes.
