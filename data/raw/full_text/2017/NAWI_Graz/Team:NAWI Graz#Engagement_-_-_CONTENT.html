We engaged with people from around 17 to 18 years up to 60+ years. Through many social events, we successfully taught thousands of people about genetic engineering and synthetic biology, as well as the iGEM competition and what is all about. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section container"><H2 class="section-sub">HLW - Wolfsberg</H2><DIV class="section-text container"><P>In spring 2017, we visited our first school in Austria, the “HLW Wolfsberg” in Carinthia. This school is a secondary
                school with the focus on industrial management, but the students of the 5th grade have a specialized course
                called “genetics”, where they learn everything about genes and DNA technology and all the processes behind.
                For this reason, the school gave us the opportunity to introduce ourselves and dive deeper into subject with
                the pupils. </P><P>To make it more comprehensible for the students, we prepared a powerpoint presentation. In the course of this
                presentation, we discussed the iGEM competition - what it is all about and what you have to do to become
                part of it. After talking about iGEM in general, we introduced them into our project “Colibot” and explained
                them how we want to create a  robot-bacteria interface. Since the students attended the genetic class, we
                also discussed the topic genetic engineering, some advantages and disadvantages of its use and the evaluation
                of potential risks. On one hand, it was important for us to raise awareness for genetic engineering and to
                engage in prejudices, but on the other hand, we also wanted to hear their opinion and where they see potential
                applications of genetic engineering in the future. </P><P>
                After the presentation, we prepared an experiment in which we isolated DNA from strawberries and bananas using salt, dish
                liquid and ethanol. Some of the pupils were very enthusiastic about the isolation process and to see, how
                easy it could be, generally, to isolate DNA with everyday tools. </P><P>Because of the attentiveness and curiosity of the students for all the topics, the presentation was a big success
                for us. Since natural science is not the main focus in that kind of school, we were really impressed by the
                knowledge of some of the students. </P></DIV><DIV id="slide2" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel2"><DIV class="carousel-inner"><DIV class="section-sub-text container"><B>Slideshow 1:</B> School visit at HLW - Wolfsberg

This is also a secondary school with
                specialized courses in natural science, so we thought it could be another great audience to deepen into the
                subject. </P><P>
                The procedure was planned the same as at the other school, but this time we got supported by the <A href="https://www.nawigraz.at">“NAWI Graz Institution”</A> and the <A href="https://www.humantechnology.at">“Human.Technology Styria”</A> (HTS). The reason why those
                two institutions supported us was not only to talk about iGEM and our project, but also to show the students
                some possible fields of studies and what you can do with this kind of education for your future career. </P><P>The <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAWI_Graz/Attributions">“NAWI Graz Institute”</A> talked about the possible studies students could attend
                at the Karl-Franzens University and University of Technology of Graz, since the institution offers “joint NAWI
                Graz study programmes” in Bioscience, Chemistry, Earth, Space and Environmental Sciences, Mathematics and
                Physics, instead of separated ones. </P><P>Followed by <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAWI_Graz/Attributions">“Human.Technology Styria”</A> presentation, the students were shown the possibilities
                they have after university and different fields they could work in. Since HTS is an economic initiative focused
                on strengthening the competitive capabilities of Styrian companies, institutions and scientific bodies working
                in the field of human technology, we also discussed the newest technological developments in the field of
                life science and human health care. </P></DIV><DIV id="slide1" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"><DIV class="carousel-inner"><DIV class="section-sub-text container"><B> Slideshow 2:</B> iGEM Team NAWI_Graz visits the students at BRG - Kepler

We achieved our goals by educating the students on topics
                like gene technology, biotechnology and synthetic biology, as well as promoting iGEM and talking about our
                project. Hopefully, we were also able to inspire some of the pupils to pursue a career in natural sciences.
            </P><P>Talking to students in that age can sometimes present some difficulties because of their “I am not interested
                at all - mood”. For us, it was really impressing on how they paid attention and tried to listen and understand
                the topics, despite the complexity of the content. No one of us ever did presentations like this in schools
                before, thus we were very proud that we were able to achieve such good results all together and show them
                some possibilities for their future career.</P><P><I>“I personally think it is very important to arouse the curiosity of pupils at an early stage, that they understand
                that one can also achieve a lot from Austria and be part of something big. It is great to see how students
                contribute to scientific progress”</I> - Silvia Joham (Teacher for Biology and Chemistry at HLW - Wolfsberg).</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section container"><H2 class="section-sub">Discussion Night</H2><DIV class="section-text container">
           In Austria, people are rather negatively opposed to the concept of genetic engineering. The reason for this is presumably because genetic engineering in Austria plays no great role in, for example, the agricultural sector. We do not have to resort to genetic engineering either economically or agriculturally. The fewest know, that genetic engineering is also used in medicine and therefore necessary in Austria. By this misunderstanding, the generally accepted term genetic engineering has a very negative association.
 
In order to stimulate the discourse on the subject of genetic engineering, we organized a discussion evening, to which we invited experts from various fields. Through our work for iGEM, we were aware of how much is discussed about genetic engineering, although the necessary understanding is only deficient. For this reason, we have decided to organize such an evening to clarify misunderstandings and half-truths.
 
Different topics have been discussed during this evening. The aim was to increase the knowledge about the widespread use of genetic engineering in various fields. The main topics were: genetic engineering in media, genetic engineering in agriculture and foods and its use in medicine.
In addition, some key words which are often heard on the radio or read more often in the newspapers, were deepened more precisely:
Genetic engineering interventions in the environment for the “well of man”; patent of life: growing influence of large concerns; synthetic life: do we play god?

If you are wondering what Nerd Nite is – it´s an event format, where people from different fields are holding 15-minutes presentations about certain scientific topics they are interested in. These can be subjects with which the persons are intensively engaged or an area in which they are working in, but of course, all scientifically related.</P><P>It all started, when the inventor of the event was asked, why he had been absent in his local pub for the last three months. He started a presentation about the expedition he did before and because the audience was so excited about it, it became a regular event.</P><P>By now, Nerd Nite is a monthly event in more than 90 cities across the world, during which several people give short and funny, but informative presentations about different disciplines. The inventors believe, that learning is more fun when you’re drinking with friends.</P><P>As we were able to host the first Nerd Nite ever in Austria, we were very proud to present our iGEM project there as well.</P><P>One of the participants at the event was Alex Murer, former molecular biology student, who did present his start-up “Briefcase Biotech GmbH”. He is now working on a DNA-printer that makes it possible to print primer in the shortest possible time. “Producing your own DNA Primers becomes as convenient as brewing a nice cup of coffee”, Alex Murer.

                mineral water a “Spritzer”. It is an event, where people come together to talk, drink and socialize while
                having fun after a long and hard day of classes. We decided to use these kind of events to call attention
                of the students from the Technical University and Karl-Franzens University of Graz for the iGEM competition.
            </P><P>Since our team consists of students from many different fields like biotechnology, biochemistry, philosophy or
                computer science, the event attracted a very diverse audience of upcoming future scientists. Because of the
                broad range of different fields, it was very interesting discussing scientific topics from various perspectives.
                We took the chance to explain what iGEM is about as well as how to become part of it and what we are doing.
            </P><P>Besides the social advantages and informational transfer, those so called “Spritzerstandln” also offered the
                opportunity to raise a little bit of money for the iGEM competition. All in all,  the “Spriterstandln” we
                hosted were a big success, since we were able to promote our team among the students and start a discussion
