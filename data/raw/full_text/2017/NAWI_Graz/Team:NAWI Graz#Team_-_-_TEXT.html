TEAM
We proudly present the iGEM Team NAWI_Graz 2017
It all started about a year ago, in November 2016, when we decided to found the new iGEM team for the year 2017. At the beginning,                 our team consisted mainly of students in the field of molecular biology - biotechnology, biochemistry and                 molecular biomedicine, microbiology as well as philosophy. The idea was to create an interface between a                 robot and bacteria. Since a lot of informatics and computational knowledge was required, we decided to form                 a larger team together with two other groups. Since the computational scientists had previously worked on                 the project, they were interested in helping us with the programming and technical part to build the bioreactor.

Studies: Molecular Microbiology
What are you obsessed about: Fancy cooking and eating
Special quirks: Has to have at least one wristband all the time
Favorite source of caffeine: Coffee, black and strong
Most annoying trait: Always has to be right
Favorite microorganism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, well it makes beer, so that’s an easy one
What i like about iGEM?: iGEM is the first chance in our scientific life to design and carry out a whole project from scratch. In this process we                         had to use our skills and learn new ones every day and we never stop to discover new things in the                         progress of the project. This learning by doing and trying out things we have never done before,                         all on our own, is what really amazes me about iGEM and our project.

Favorite source of caffeine: Coffee.
Most annoying trait: My special quirk
Favorite microorganism: E. coli, the classic. ...because it is an important species in research and it can control robots
What i like about iGEM?: I am very proud to be part of this talented and hardworking team. In our project we created an interface between bacteria                         and robotics, allowing control of the machine by the microbes. This approach offers new applications                         in classical research areas (behavioural studies, ecology) and applied science, leading to new approaches                         in robotics (adaption of microorganisms and microorganism-like structures, evolving computational                         systems) and biotechnology (applications in bioreactors). I am also very proud of the progress we                         made starting from this basic idea.
