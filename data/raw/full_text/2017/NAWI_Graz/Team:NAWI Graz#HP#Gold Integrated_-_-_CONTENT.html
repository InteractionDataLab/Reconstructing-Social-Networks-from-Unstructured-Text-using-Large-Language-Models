        At the beginning of our project, we participated a seminar called „Synthetic Biotechnology“ supervised by our secondary PI.
        In the course of this lecture, we repeated the most used and popular cloning methods. The much more interesting part
        was learning some new cloning methods, which are on the cutting edge of gene technology. Subsequent to the seminar,
        we started to work out our project idea, finding a way to connect bacteria with a robot. At first, planning everything
        was really difficult, because we did not know how and where to begin. Nevertheless, we benefited from the long lasting
        experience of our secondary PI and got useful hints for designing of our constructs and how to start them to work
        in
        <I>E. coli</I>. Our secondary PI also suggested to work with the novel gene editing method CRISPR/Cas9. To get familiar
        with this system, we got offered an internship in the working group of CRISPR/Cas9.

        Due to our project we took part in a skype conference about safety organized by the University of Uppsala. The discussion
        was about general safety in the lab, as well as the risks of the designed constructs and what might happen if they
        were released. To evaluate potential risks, we interviewed different experts about the safety aspects of our project
        and how to improve our constructs. However, we were able to enhance our designs according to their input and increased
        our knowledge in the field of genetic engineering.
    </DIV></DIV><DIV class=" container"><H3 class="section-sub">Expert Interviews</H3><DIV class="section-sub-text container"><P>Horizontal gene transfer, HGT, always represents a certain risk factor. In the course of the interviews, we evaluated,
            among other things, the safety assessment of our construct with various professors. The talks focused on the
            importance of incorporating deficiencies and discussing different options. Finally, we decided to use the following
            <I>E. coli</I> strains because of their deficiencies: BL21, XL1-blue, TOP10 and DH5alpha. After much discussion,
            we have decided that these strains are the safest variant for our planned experiment.</P><P>Another problem we solved with the aid of an expert was the time delay from the production of the proteins till their
            degradation. After endless discussions, we came up with the solution to integrate a TEV-protease which accelerated
            the subsequent degradation. </P><P>Finally, for the fluoreszenz proteins a problem occurred referring the detection. Originally it was planned to detect
            the proteins after induction by means of a plate reader or through the robot, but since the fluorescence signal
            was way too low we had no chance in proving the presence of the proteins. Coincidentally, we came up with this
            problem during our discussion evening, which led to a lively discussion. Many solutions came up, finally we could
            agree that a Western Blot would be the most promising variant. And indeed, we have succeeded in detecting the
            protein. We are currently working on improving the fluorescence intensity. During Nerd Nite, we discussed possible
            improvements with dedicated students. Their intellectual approaches were very interesting, some of them have
            been implemented. The students were very enthusiastic that they were able to contribute to our project. </P><P>Some experts were able to support us with new input, in which areas our project could develop in the future. Many
            novel ideas that on how this project might emerge are listed in the
            <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAWI_Graz/Application">“application section”.</A> There, many speculative new ideas are described and some of our team members hope
            to be able to help bring them to life in the course of our scientific career.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=" container"><H3 class="section-sub">Model</H3><DIV class="section-sub-text container"><P>At the beginning of our project, we already had a model of our entire experimental process. Thus, we were able to
            take this to public events, such as the
            <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAWI_Graz/Engagement">“Spritzerstandl”.</A> There, we got a lot of input from the public and even made fundamentally changes on how
            the robot works. After fierce discussions, the pH-based controller has been improved by several aspects, instead
            of just reacting to sensors' left and right input signals, additionally a kind of memory has been introduced
            into the system through the creative use of the
            <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NAWI_Graz/Model">“bacterial medium”.</A> By this, the robots could no longer get stuck in corners of the maze.</P><P>In addition, the model was sent to various other iGEM teams, who also created individually mazes. Unfortunately,
            we did not have time to solve this with our physical robot, but we can show in the model that this would theoretically
            be feasible.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class=" container"><H3 class="section-sub">Future iGEM Projects at Universities of Graz</H3><DIV class="section-sub-text container"><P>Since donations to non-official associations can lead to some difficulties for many companies, we decided to found an official association called “NAWiGEM - association to support the projects of the Graz iGEM team”under the auspices of the DIY electro- and biohacker scene in Graz, the Realraum<SUP>3</SUP> and the [OpenBioLabGrazAustria].</P><P>To increase the degree of popularity of iGEM and everything connected to it, we promoted all iGEM related topics at our events. We constantly received new inquiries from interested students on how to participate in the competition. Through the interviews with various experts, we were able to increase our awareness in different institutes. This made it possible for us to appeal to students from different fields.
        The first meetings with the new participants already showed a huge interest of engineering students for the competition.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
