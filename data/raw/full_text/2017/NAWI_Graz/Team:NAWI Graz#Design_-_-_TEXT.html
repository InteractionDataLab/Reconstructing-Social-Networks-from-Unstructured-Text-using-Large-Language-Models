DESIGN
The bacteria-robot interface is realized as a highly modular feedback system.
A mobile robot’s sensor values alter the environment of E. coli strains that were designed to respond to these changes with increased expression of fluorescent                 proteins. In turn, this fluorescence is measured and its quantities are translated into robot behaviour.
For how it all played out, see Results , but let’s first have a glimpse at the modules comprising the feedback loop (for a full description                 see the different sections in Parts ).
Fig. 1: Overview of the whole system: a Thymio II robot sends its sensor values to the control server, who translates         those values into environmental stimuli for the bacteria. Shown here are the interaction modules (IMs) for heat shock         and pH. These stimuli trigger the expression of fluorescent proteins, which are detected in the fluorescence measurement         chamber. If the fluorescence is strong enough, the server will tell the robot to change its behaviour.
The Bacteria
Our cultures have one goal: they should react to changes in their environment by expressing fluorescent proteins. Therefore,         we introduced three promoters, two sensing the pH and one sensing the temperature of the culture media. Activation         of one promoter leads to transcription and translation of a fluorescence protein.
"ibpA" - Heat Shock Promoter
Full description
The heat shock promoter ibpA is controlled by the transcription factor σ 32. In principle, the exposure to high temperatures leads to an increase of σ 32, which subsequently enables heat shock promoters to be recognized by the RNA polymerase. The promoter exhibits a high induction rate and high levels of expression. In our experiment, the ibpA promoter controls the expression of GFP.
"asr" - Acid Inducible Promoter
Full description
Promoter activity is controlled by the RstAB System detecting the pH and the PhoRB System activated when inorganic                 phosphate is rare. Thus, expression only works in low phosphate media (LPM). When grown in LPM and activated                 by a switch of pH to 5.5 the promoter becomes active and mCardinal is expressed. To enhance expression an                 extra ribosome binding site (RBS) was inserted between the promoter and mCardinal.

"alx" - Alkaline-induced Roboswitch
Fig. 3: The figure shows the molecular construction of the alkaline-inducible promoter.
Full description
Regulation of translation is managed by a pH sensitive riboswitch. The riboswitch itself, a mRNA part 5’                     of the RNA coding for our green fluorescence protein mNeonGreen is regulated by a constitutive promoter.                     Hence regulation of mNeonGreen translation is managed by the riboswitch and subjected to pH. When pH                     is neutral, the structure of the riboswitch prevents the ribosome from binding to the RBS. When pH rises,                     the structure of the mRNA changes and allows the ribosome to bind the RBS and therefore translation can                     start.
The Bioreactor
Full description
Our system consists of several modules, we differentiate them in 3 layers seen in figure 4. The layer on top is the INPUT                 layer. It is a steady source of medium or variable liquid, which can be changed and is a key component for                 its variability. The ANALYSE and MAINTAIN layer consists of two elements: the reactor to maintain our culture                 and two separate measuring units, one of which is the OD 600 measure unit and the other one can be changed as a variable component (see Interaction Modules (IMs) and Fluorescence Measurement Chamber (FMC) ). Both the variable liquid and the variable measure unit give                 us the freedom to change our system for different projects. In the OUTPUT layer we collect the waste from                 our measure units. Further to obtain a steady OD 600 value the OD 600 measure unit also transports medium containing cell mass to the waste to regulate the OD 600 value, if it is too high.
Fig. 4: Bioreactor design. The basic construction of our reactor corresponds to standard bioreactor setup.             Additionally it contains a variable measurement unit, which can be adapted to different parameters.
Interaction Modules (IMs)
An IM receives bacterial suspension and exposes it to a stimulus, whose quantity is determined by the robot’s sensor readings. We have designed and built two IMs, one for heating up the suspension and a second one to set its pH (both ways). The “Variable Measuring unit” shown in Fig. 4 consists of at least one IM and an Fluorescence Measurement Chamber (FMC) . The modularity of our design allows us to replace one IM for another (or even employ both) while keeping the rest of the setup intact.
Temperature IM
Full description
In this module, tubes carrying the bacterial suspension are coiled between a Peltier-element and a styrofoam block allowing for quick heating of the suspension.
Fig. 5: The picture shows the setting of our temperature interaction module.
pH IM
Full description
This module consists of two lab bottles, containing acid and base solution. Two peristaltic pumps are controlled according to the sensor values of the robot, to specifically set the pH value of the reactor medium.

Fluorescence Measurement Chamber (FMC)
Full description
A 3D printed case housing a cuvette (with in- and outflow tubes), LEDs to excite the fluorescent proteins, optical filters                 and two camera-modules form our FMC. We look into the raw RGB data in a region of interest to detect bacterial                 fluorescence. The information from both cameras is aggregated into a single output: the next command to the                 robot.

Control System
Full description
A Raspberry Pi coordinates the behavior of all the components of the system as well as offering an interface                 to users. It maintains a steady-state in the bioreactor, pumps bacterial suspension from the reactor into                 the other modules (the Interaction Modules (IMs) and Fluorescence Measurement Chamber (FMC) ), controls the behavior of those and communicates with the robot by receiving sensor readings and sending                 commands.
Fig. 8: Our server for the control system, hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The mini computer is connected to a camera         module and controls several hardware components of the bioreactor via GPIO connections.
Robot
Full description
We hooked up a Raspberry Pi to a Thymio II educational robot in order to enable it to communicate with a server on the             internet. The robot moves around in a maze and streams its various sensor readings to the server, while in return             receiving commands from the server (according to bacterial fluorescence) to change its behavior.
