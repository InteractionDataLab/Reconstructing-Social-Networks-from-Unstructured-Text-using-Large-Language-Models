Integrated Human Practices
This year the iGEM Team NAWI_Graz organized different events throughout the year as part of human practice work. We considered                     it particularly important, that students think about their career opportunities early on as they are                     our future. It is in their hands, which directions and paths are taken once and since genetic engineering                     and synthetic biology play an essential role here, it was very important for us to talk with them about                     this. The fewest people know that genetic engineering is not only used in the agricultural sector but                     also in medicine and therefore essential in Austria. By this misunderstanding, the generally accepted                     term genetic engineering has a negative association. In order to stimulate the discourse of genetic engineering                     and synthetic biology, we organized a discussion evening to clarify those misunderstandings and half-truths.                     To improve our project and construct design, we organized interviews with some experts from different                     fields. An important point here was the safety assessment of our project to what extent it could pose                     a risk or threat to the environment. Since we are a large group, finances play a very important role                     in our project. As the organization of a “Spritzerstandl” is a good way to increase the degree of popularity                     of iGEM, we planned several events, not only to earn money, also to talk to students and discuss scientific                     topics.
