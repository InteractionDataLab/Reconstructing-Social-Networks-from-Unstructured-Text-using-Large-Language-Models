pH PLASMID
Our two pH sensing constructs consist of promoters activated through high or low pH and two fluorescence proteins with fast maturation time. When pH of the media is changed above 8.0 or below 5.0 expression of a fluorescence protein is activated.
asr Promoter
asr Promoter: BBa_ K2348001
mCardinal: BBa_ K2348002
asr controlled mCardinal: BBa_ K2348011
Fig. 1: Overview of the regultion of the asr promoter by RstA/B and PhoB/R system.
The asr promoter was first described by Suziedeliene et al. in 19991. They showed that asr is induced through low pH, about                 4.8, and that the promoter is controlled by the phoBR system. They also named the asr promoter, because of                 RNA they found after shifting E. coli to low pH conditions and therefore named the RNA they found and its                 corresponding promoter acid shock RNA (asr). In 2007 Ogasawara et al2. found a second regulatory system                 controlling asr transcription by SELEX search for PhoQP-RstBA binding sequences. Hence the asr promoter is                 directly controlled by two different systems, the PhoBR system activated through low inorganic phosphate                 and the RstAB system sensing the pH. RstAB itself is controlled by PhoQP-system activated by low Mg2+ concentrations.
This complex regulatory mechanism for this small promoter amazed us and provided us with an interesting challenge to get             expression going. Because of the two regulatory systems only becoming active when Mg2+ or Pi are low expression             could not be done in LB-media. Also, our M9 media used for expression for the thermos project did not work because             as it seems both systems must be active to activated asr transcription and M9 still contains Mg2+. To solve this             problem, we used the LPM media described by Suziedeliene et al.3. This allowed us to express our fluorescence             protein mCardinal by shifting the cells to acid LPM media with pH 5.0 and 4.5. Best expression was achieved at             pH 5.0.
Fig. 2: Schematic structure of our asr_mCardinal construct containing all important coding and noncoding parts.
This part actually is a composite part containing the asr promoter and mCardinal. Additionally, between promoter and cardinal an additional RBS, a TEV-site and a F-degron are inserted. Also, mCardinal is 6xHis-taged and the part ends with a T7-terminator. Because the part does not work when build as Biobrick due to the Biobrick scar this part is listed as basic part.
TEV-site and F-degron allow a fast and controllable degradation of proteins and in combination with the fast maturation times of our fluorescence proteins, allow a fast colour change. This enables shorter time spans between signals when controlling the robot’s movement. Due to a change of our reactor design this feature is no longer needed because the pH is only changed in a small amount of media which is discarded after measurement.
The 6xHis-tag allows detection of mNeonGreen on protein level and the T7-terminator stops translation. The part itself was created using extension-PCR and overlap-PCR.
alx Promoter
alx Promoter: alx Promoter and Riboswitch
mNeonGreen: mNeonGreen
alx controlled mNeonGreen: alx controlled mNeonGreen
Alx was first described in 1990 by Bingham et al4. They created over 93.00 operon fusion with lacZ and screened those for             increased activity at pH 8.5. The locus they found was named alx. In 2009 the function of alx was characterised             by Nechooshtan et al5. They showed that the 5’ part of alx mRNA regulates translation by forming secondary structures.             High pH leads to pausing in transcription of this mRNA part which leads to a different secondary structure allowing             the ribosom to bind the RBS. Under neutral conditions the transcription is not stopped and secondary structures             disable the ribosom to bind the RBS. This mechanism makes alx the first discovered pH-responsive riboregulatory             gene.
We used this regulatory unit to express mNeonGreen under alkaline conditions. To increase expression an extra RBS was added             after the riboswitch, leading to a constitutive expression of mNeonGreen. Hence, we used our constructed without             the extra RBS to get pH depended expression but also showed that the riboswitch really is the regulatory part             of this system.
Fig. 3: Schematic structure of our alx-mNeonGreen construct containing all important coding and noncoding parts.
This part actually is a composite part containing the alx promoter and riboswitch and mNeonGreen. Additionally, between riboswitch and mNeonGreen a TEV-site and a F-degron are inserted. Also, mNeonGreen is FLAG-taged and the part ends with a T7-terminator. Because the part does not work when build as Biobrick due to the Biobrick scar this part is listed as basic part.
The function of TEV-site and F-degron is explained above . The FLAG-tag allows detection of mNeonGreen on protein level and the T7-terminator stops translation. The part itself was created using extension PCR and overlap PCR.
