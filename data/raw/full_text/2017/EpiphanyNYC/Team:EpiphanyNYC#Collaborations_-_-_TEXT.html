October 4, 2017
Greece iGEM Team
We collaborated with the Greece iGEM team and answered two of their questionnaires to take part in their risk assessment and large-scale human practices campaign. In exchange, they assessed the risks of our project and the ethical, health and environmental consequences of it by filling out our survey.
In return, we confirmed their data by analyzing the DNA samples they provided using a nanodrop machine.
