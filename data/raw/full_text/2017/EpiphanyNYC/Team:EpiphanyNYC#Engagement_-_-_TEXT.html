Public Engagement
 
Our team is rooted on our passion for public engagement, and we believe that interacting with people outside of our team is essential to the spread of our research. Our journey to expand started this summer, where we went to the headquarters of Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA) and Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) to present and learn about different brain diseases. We partnered up with the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation to promote 10,000 daily steps to people of all ages in New York. From the educational aspects of it, we went on to meet the Columbia University Synthetic Biology Team and present to Stuyvesant High School. To act within the hospital rooms, we also attended the NYC HDSA Family Education Day at Columbia University Medical Center to chat directly with Huntington’s disease patients, their caregivers and public advocates. We find passion in such commitments, as our goal is to, not only conduct research, but to promote health and to raise awareness to the general public.

We had a great opportunity to meet with entire staff at Alzheimer’s Foundation of America (AFA) Headquarters in New York. Thanks to AFA and its staff, we had an opportunity to share our HD Resolution iGEM project and learned about Alzheimer’s Disease since both diseases are both brain diseases. Thank you to Sherry Cheng, Coordinator at AFA for organizing this event and Stephanie Crumpton and the rest of AFA team for their hospitality.
