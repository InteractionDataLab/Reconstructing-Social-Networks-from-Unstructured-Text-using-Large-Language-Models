SOHEE LEE
Hey, I’m one of the Project Leads for our team, as well as a member of Website Content and Wetlab. I’m a senior at Stuyvesant High School, and I love eating and watching TedEd videos in my free time.  One day, I want to adopt a pig so I can be inspired to become a vegan.
RACHEL KWON
Hello! I’m one of the Project Leads for our team, and I’m a member of Outreach/Fundraising, Website Content, and Wetlab. I’m a senior at Stuyvesant High School, and during school hours my mind is most captivated by Biology and European History. Many periods out of ten are spent in lab rooms. However, outside of school I am an avid reader, a member of a Hip-Hop dance team, and a lover of music ranging from Fauré to Quavious Marshall. I aspire to major in biology and pursue a career in medicine.
