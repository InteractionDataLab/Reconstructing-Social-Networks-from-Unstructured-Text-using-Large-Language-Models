The Problem</SPAN></H1><P class="c1"><SPAN>Measuring the growth of cells is a vital task in any biology lab across the world. Thousands of dollars are spent on spectrophotometers and analysers to measure the optical densities of cell cultures. More importantly, </SPAN><SPAN>hundreds of researcher-hours</SPAN><SPAN class="c3"> are spent taking samples, diluting them and measuring the optical density, again and again, through the long nights of running growth curves.</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">There do exist automatic devices that can measure OD, such as the Bioscreen C, but their prohibitive cost (in the tens of thousands of dollars), low volume capacity, and inability to handle high ODs make them non-viable as a substitute for manual pipetting in most experimental scenarios.</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN>Other machines simply lack the capabilities to </SPAN><SPAN>...</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">There has to be a better way. That way is GCODe.</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">GCODe (Growth Curve and Optical DEnsity) is an optical density measurement device that will not only take readings at pre-programmed intervals or continuously, but will also aerate and dilute the culture as required. It can even send you a message when the OD reaches a particular level, just in time to you to start the next stage of your experiment. Fundamentally, it automates the grunt work of growth curves, in a manner that allows you to walk away from the lab, secure in the knowledge that you will be alerted when your cells are ready for you.</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">Our work stemmed from our own frustrations running growth curves night after night, and was also inspired by the OD meter built by the 2014 Aachen iGEM team. We worked incrementally, starting with a rudimentary box of wiring, designing version after version in response to feedback from the iGEM wetlab team, as they trialled our device, and other labs and professors from across IISc.</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">We currently have two versions of GCODe manufactured, tested and fully documented.</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">They are:</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN>GCODe</SPAN><SPAN class="c3"> Pro</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">And </SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">GCODe Mini</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN>Please</SPAN><SPAN class="c3"> follow the links to find out about their capabilities, design, cost and assembly instructions, and the results of our tests on them.</SPAN></P><H1 class="c9" id="h.ymc4rrnn8z3"><SPAN class="c6">2.

Optical Density is measured by drawing the liquid into a standard cuvette, which allows the flexibility to grow unlimited amounts of culture in a conical flask or any other vessel.</SPAN></H2><H2 class="c4" id="h.kz090js5uijl"><SPAN>Design</SPAN></H2><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">THe GCODE Pro has X main components</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">THe Analysis unit uses a cuvette supplied and drained by a needle, but the measurement system is the same as the one used in the Mini</SPAN></P><P class="c1"><SPAN class="c3">The Sampling Unit draws liquid from the conical flask, or culture vessel, dilutes it as programmed, and delivers the culture to the cuvette.
