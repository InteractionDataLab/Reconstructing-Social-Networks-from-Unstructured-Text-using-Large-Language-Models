Talking in Numbers
Flotation Analysis
This part of the model deals with estimating the number density \(\rho (z,t)\) of gas vesicles in a bioreactor using tools of fluid mechanics and statistical physics and finding the optimum skimming height for maximum protein purification.
Péclet Number
The Péclet number for a suspension is a dimensionless quantity which can be used to determine the relative strength of the effects of driving forces and thermal diffusion in the motion of a suspended particle in the solvent. In a general sense, it can be defined as,  \[P_{e}=\frac{\text{Rate of motion due to external forces}}{\text{Rate of diffusive transport in the medium}}\]  In the case of a particle moving through the media having a effective radius \(a\), the Péclet number takes the form[1],  $$P_{e}=\frac{\dot{\gamma} a^{2}}{D_{Th}}$$
