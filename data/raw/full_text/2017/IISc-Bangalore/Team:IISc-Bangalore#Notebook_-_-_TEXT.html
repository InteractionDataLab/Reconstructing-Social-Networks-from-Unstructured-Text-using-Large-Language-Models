Preparation
16/3/17
Autoclaved items and prepared media
17/3/17
Obtained S. cerevisiae BY4741 from Dr. Rajyaguru’s lab and incubated it at 30 degree celcius
Inoculated the above strain in 2 mL YPD [4.5 mL YPD media + 0.5 mL 20% glucose] using a sterile toothpick
18/3/17
Went to Prof. Dighe’s lab to get some chemicals, sans people
Yeast in the inoculated tube are growing fine but seem to have aggregated at the bottom.
19/3/17
Started 8 growth curves
Cuvette placement (orientation) was not right for the first few readings; path length was not 1 cm.
21/3/17
Autoclaved plates, falcons, media (YPDA and YPGA)
Got the plasmid pRS316 and HeLa cells from a lab
Decided to try shockwave transformation of yeast. We will be amplifying the plasmid pRS316 in E. coli, mini prepping it and taking it to Aerospace department.
22/3/17
Got DH5a competent cells from Prof. Chakravortty’s Lab. We have transformed the pRS316 plasmid in E. coli. We also made SOB media. Our selection marker for now is Ampicillin.
23/3/17
Plates (one streak and one spread) yeast culture and kept the remaining in cold room. We also observed plates of E.coli DH5a today
24/3/17
Transformants from the Amp+ plate were inoculated in SOB (3 test tubes)
WT from the amp- plate was inoculated in SOB (2 test tubes)
Observations: No GFP fluorescence was observed, possibly because plasmid is low copy (?). Note from Sai: In hindsight, we should have realized that the GFP was under a yeast promoter (hehe)
27/3/17
Step 8 of protocol failed: No pellet was obtained. Need to redo entire set of experiments :(
Miniprep was then carried out (protocol followed from Sambrook)
29/3/17
Plasmid (Yeast GFP) brought from Prof. Rajyaguru’s lab
pRS316 Amp/Ura. High conc, use 1 μL from Nupur’s protocol
Will show GFP expression in yeast only, not E.coli
31/3/17
Buffers for electrophoresis were made and autoclaved
Electrophoresis showed presence of plasmid! :D
02/4/17
YPD media prepared and inoculation done.
03/4/17
Shockwave transformation canceled by Akshay. Images of yeast cells were taken under the microscope for heamocytometry
At night comp cells prep was done. Gel was run for the transformants (terrible results, needs redoing)
30/4/17
Lab meeting done at 20:00. Plans were laid down for the whole project. As a whole, need to
Overexpress hexose transporters
Overexpress invertase
ACE2 gene knockout to induce clumping
Create GFP-GVNP and GVNP-TEV biobricks
Hardware part
Fiji plugin for haemocytometer yeast count
Fresh LB, YPAD, YPAD (2x) was prepared
01/5/17
Heat shock transformation carried out in Dipa lab.
02/5/17
(DC lab) Observation:- The colonies look good. Thus procedure shall be taken forward. Fresh media prepared, plates autoclaved.
04/5/17
Raj and Sharath carried out miniprep in DC lab.
Nanodrop readings too high. Ran, gel; too thick, not too clear. Repeated gel with lower concentration of DNA, presence of genomic DNA contamination and RNA contamination (probably non functional RNAse), need to repeat experiment
05/5/17
Raj and Sharath repeat miniprep, ran gel. Do get plasmid bands but with heavy DNA and RNA contamination (except for the third lane, for reasons unknown)
SOB plates were prepared, YPAD plates were prepared, and some required reagent solutions were prepared
07/5/17
Yeast cultures discarded, cant store them  properly without drastically affecting the efficiency. Fresh inoculum prepared
08/5/17
Bulk extraction commences from a 50 ml culture. Ran the gel and SUCCESS! :D . Realized some errors in our protocol which helped us prevent genomic DNA contamination. Nanodrop readings were positive and resuspension was done in TE and not MilliQ.
09/5/17
Met Nupur and asked for selection media, and the complete plasmid map we were given. Also shockwave transformation is a go, the first trial should be over tomorrow, 10th
10/5/17
Cleaned up the lab: hoods, drawers, trash. Rearranged equipment more sanely. Checked stocks of Eppendorfs, tips, etc.
11/5/17
LiAc transformation and shockwave transformation were carried out. Technical difficulties lead to LiAc transformation taking a LOT of time to carry out.
Media was prepared
After meeting with Dr Srinath, realized "Why work with yeast? E.coli is easier to work with, protocols are easier and less time consuming"
12/5/17
Made reagent stocks.
15/5/17
Media preparation. Different percentages of agarose gel prepared to check for fragility and suitability for low melting agar for cell density measurements. The burette idea was discarded, because vortexes formed and mixing occurs.
16/5/17
Inoculated DH5A (no plasmid) in LB media. Realized there are some contamination problems. Glycerol stocks were prepared and some transformants were plated
18/5/17
More inoculations done, growth curve of E.coli and yeast was carried out.
At 4:35 PM Srinath sir entered the lab and questioned everyone about the project. He pointed out various errors people were committing and asked for a lab meeting scheduled on 19th.
30/5/17
The lab notebook had been neglected for the past few days, sadly
Yesterday, five different transformants of pSB1A3 (ampicillin resistant) were plated. Today, we will miniprep the plasmid and ideally run a gel to confirm. To do this, we have prepared alkaline lysis solutions I and III beforehand.
Made working stocks of the required reagents
Ran a miniprep. Ran a gel, absolutely no bands were present. There was a minor screwup while loading. Will run gel again tomorrow.
05/6/17
Once again, a major ga in the lab notebook.
Possible reason for failure in gel- maybe used 50x TAE rather than 1x. Maybe EtBr diffused too fast. The second gel ran on 31st failed because probably 20x SB was used. . Even the ladder was not seen so the problem lied with the gel. The third gel maybe ran for too long and thus no bands were seen.
On the plus side, the assembly plan is going well. Primers are being designed, to be finalized with Arunavo tomorrow and then with Srinath sir afterwards
Four primary inoculums made today. If they are dense enough then we'll carry out miniprep tomorrow, then run a gel and discuss primers.
08/6/17
Haemocytometry imaging was carried out. We tried out Nigrosin staining for contrast between cells. There was non uniform cell density due to smearing and dead cells take up the die,thus we need to counterstain with something else. We need to come up with aa reproducible protocol for collab with other teams
LB kits and SOB kits were made. Comp cells were transformed using pSB1C3 and pSB1A3.
09/6/17
Imaging was tried using the saturated E.coli and yeast primary inoculum (set up on 8.6.17 night). Nothing significant came out from the 1st sem lab compound microscope for safranin staining.
Phase contrast inverted microscope was used to take images. The cells and the grid of the haemocytometer do not come on the same focal plane. So superimposition of the cell and the grid image was suggested. Also E.coli cells doesn't come in 10X zoom and in 40X zoom the grids of the haemocytometer go out of the frame. ~Will try to take image from the inverted microscope on Monday (12.6) in 1st sem lab.
Plates containing transformed cells didnt show any colonies till night
10/9/17
SOB+chloramphenicol plates are made for transformation. Cells were transformed with 10, 50, 100 pg/microL concentrations of the plasmid and plated on SOB+ chloramphenicol plates in duplicates .Two controls were plates on -ve chloramphenicol and +ve chloramphenicol plates.
11/6/17
In the morning, imaging was done with safranin. Not going to use nigrosin anymore. Tried E. coli and yeast. Yeast looks good without dye, but planning to use it anyway to improve contrast for the software. Camera takes worse images compared to direct view through eyepiece. :(
Prepared more SOB plates with and without chloramphenicol. Went to Dighe’s lab, collected 3 aliquots of competent DH5alpha and two plasmids (NRR3GST and N3NRRCisT). Will collect Pichia culture/plate from Simna tomorrow (call 9535145489 to confirm)
Returned to lab, and immediately transformed their comp cells using comp cell test kit (for positive control). Used plates with IPTG (100 uL of 40 mM filter-sterilized IPTG spread over and dried). Right now, going to transform our comp cells (in duplicates) using the comp cell test kit.
19/6/17
Lab notebook has not been updated in quite a while again. We should have… Anyway, stuff last week failed. One miniprep+gel went well. Some transformants of J04450 were red while others on the same plate were not. Some of the red colonies were - “papillae,” apparently. We tried miniprepping them and got a good gel only once. WT DH5A and Pichia X33 plates were streaked.
Then, the transformation work started. 3*50 µL aliquots each of TSS- and CaCl2-competent cells were transformed with 10 pg/µL, 50 pg/µL and 100 pg/µL of J04450. From each transformant tube, three plates were made: 100 µL directly, 20 µL (with 80 µL PBS) and the remainder (pellet resuspended in 100 µL PBS). Spread plating was then done carefully.
22/6/17
A test PCR was done today. The results were disappointing as the band obtained was very weak, large an\mount of primer dimers too. Thus proper selectio0n of primers will be done and PCR shall be repeated tomorrow.
Things learned at Lupin
Look up stripping and redressing gas vesicles from P. rubescens and see if it has been done. Look up the protocols if so. Warning: P. rubescens toxicity (hepatotoxic microcystins). If not, think about using other gas vesicles... haloarchaeal/Anabaena?
Obtain P. rubescens (order from reputable online sources or obtain from nearby institutes). Look up protocols to culture and lyse the cells. Find someone who works on this to help us. Contact Walsby. Look at how gas vesicles are purified from them. Purify large numbers of gas vesicles, concentrate them, and store for future use. Assay their critical pressure, try centrifugation at various rpms, take images, try FACS (?), try SEM/TEM.
Try overexpressing GvpA in E. coli. Decide on a promoter and RBS, and create an assembly plan for the GvpA plasmid. Order the necessary primers, assemble the plasmid. Transform into E. coli. Three possibilities: 1) nothing happens, 2) inclusion bodies are formed, 3) entire gas vesicles are formed. Look up a way to distinguish between these possibilities. If 1), give up. If 2), try denaturing, renaturing and see if gas vesicles are formed. Otherwise give up. 3) Lyse the cells, purify large numbers of gas vesicles, concentrate them, and store for future use.
Create an assembly plan for the GvpC-linker-DDDDK-sfGFP construct that can be used in both E. coli and Pichia by adding necessary promoters, RBSes, terminators and restriction sites using primers. Order the necessary primers for everything, assemble the plasmids. Transform into E. coli and Pichia. Overexpress the fusion protein. Create a rough protein extract.
Demonstrate iFLOAT by mixing gas vesicles purified in Steps 1/2 with the rough protein extract of Step 3 and performing serial purifications. At each stage, assay the quantity of protein purified. Perform protein purity assays (HPLC).
Design an adapter BioBrick for any protein someone might like to purify using the iFLOAT method. Create an assembly plan and execute it.
Fancy stuff we can try if we have time:  Try out acoustic sedimentation of cell lysate. Look into using gas vesicles for purifying other things that have protein binding domains (GvpC-BINDER) e.g. mammalian cells [a more general purification strategy].  Look into using it for rough enzyme industries. Try optimizing process with respect to temperature, reactor topography. Try designing a continuous flow device to execute iFLOAT, say with immobilized enterokinase beads in the final chamber. Think about reusing GvpA multiple times.
01/9/17
Orders for our biobricks placed, incase more problems occur with minipreps and other protocols.
Project work
12/9/17
Made primary inoculum of DH5A and TG1 for TSS comp cell prep
13/9/17
Gold plating for SEM, and SEM imaging of the gas vesicles was carried out. Vesicles of similar size were visible at low concentrations. At highe concentrations, salt crystals are predominant as the samples were stored in PBS. Removing salts for SEM is not viable as salt is required to maintain isotonicity.
Plates, eppendorfs, and spreaders were autoclaved. Chloramphenicol testing and comp cell prep was scheduled.. Subcultures of DH5A and TG1 were made
14/9/17
Plates check, cmp works. Comp cells prepared, DH5A: TSS protocol, TG1: CaCl2 protocol

Ran 60 colony PCRs (30 for sfGFP-Spycatcher transformants, 30 for 6xHis-mCherry transformants); patched colonies onto fresh plates. Then ran gel to check bands (expected 1.56kB for sfGFP-SC. Incubated B11 and D26 in duplicate for plasmid isolation.
20/10/17
Plasmids were isolated from B11 and D26 according to miniprep protocol; nanodrop readings taken
Set up diagnostic digests to verify plasmid size annd ligation
Single digests
B11 plasmid 1 - NEB3.1, PstI
B11 plasmid 2, NEB 3.1, PstI
