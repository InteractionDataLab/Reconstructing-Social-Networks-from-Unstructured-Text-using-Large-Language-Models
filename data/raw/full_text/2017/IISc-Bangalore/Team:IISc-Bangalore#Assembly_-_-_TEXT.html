BioBrick Transformations
The five BioBricks we are using were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α — chosen for its recA and endA mutations that allow for high-yield minipreps.

Plasmid Isolation
Minipreps were performed using three colonies on each transformation plate to confirm the presence of the plasmid. One positive transformant for each BioBrick was used to make a glycerol stock.
PCRs
Our assembly begins with our PCRs: using carefully-designed primers with 5'-overhangs, we add restriction sites, linkers and other features to our parts of interest. Since most of our PCRs have such overhangs, our annealing temperature changes after the first few cycles — our PCR cycle parameters account for this variation. In addition, we used NEB's Q5 MasterMix and NEB's Phusion polymerase, both high-fidelity DNA polymerases which have a higher annealing temperature than usual.

Screening Transformants
We screened 30 transformants from each plate using colony PCR with primers VF2 and VR, which we standardized using Taq polymerase (annealing temperature of 56°C).
Figure 6 : Colony PCR of sfGFP-SpyCatcher colonies (B1-B21) and 6xHis-mCherry colonies (D1-D21)
We obtained the expected band (~1.5 kb) for one of the thirty sfGFP-SpyCatcher colonies tested while none of the thirty 6xHis-mCherry colonies tested gave the expected band (> 1.1 kb). After plasmid isolation from this positive clone, we transformed BL21 (DE3) to continue with our protein experiments.
Other parts
Due to the failure of our assemblies for the other BioBricks, we were not able to submit these parts on time, but we have submitted the designs for future teams to use.
