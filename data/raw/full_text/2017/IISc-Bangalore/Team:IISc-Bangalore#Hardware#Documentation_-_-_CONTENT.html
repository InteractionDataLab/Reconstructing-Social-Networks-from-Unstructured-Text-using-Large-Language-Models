For laser cutting, the material we used is a standard opaque 4mm acrylic sheet. Simply submit the .dwg file in the laser-cutting-source-files folder to the laser cutting facility, along with the acrylic sheet. The Gerber files for PCB fabrication are in GCODeMini_PCB_V3.zip inside the zip file. The schematics are given as .pdf files. If that was confusing, worry not, the Construction Manual has much more detailed instructions.</P><P>Remember, the total cost of parts, PCB fabrication and laser cutting should be less than one hundred dollars, depending on how much you amortize electronic component costs by buying in bulk (Recommended - Share them out!), and local fab prices in your city.

GCODe Code Files</A>: Here's the entire source code for the Mini. Once you extract it, you will get a folder named 'Code'. This is referred to as the Code folder in the manual. Installing it is not more complicated than running the Arduino IDE, and that is pretty simple. Again, instructions in the Manual.</P><P>Things you need to run the software:
Python with <A href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</A>, <A href="https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html">matplotlib</A> and <A href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pushbullet.py">pushbullet</A>libraries.

What’s next? Why, using it, of course! As with any complex electronic device, it needs a User Manual. Ours explains the little things - such as making sure it has reached the temperature of the incubator - that let your experiments run smooth as silk.</P><P>Things you need:

He did it in just under two hours! <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:IISc-Bangalore/HP/Silver#hands-on">See what he had to say about the manual.</A></P><H1 id="pro">Build Your Own GCODe Pro</H1><P>The GCODe Pro is still under development. However, if you’d still like to try building it, we welcome you to help us develop it further. This section includes all the resources you need to build the Pro up to the level of development we had reached by October 31st, 2017. (Without all the false starts, of course - For that, see our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:IISc-Bangalore/Hardware/Notebook">Hardware Evolution</A> page) As of 31 Oct 2017:</P><OL><LI>The electronics is complete - including the PCB design. The Gerber files have been uploaded.</LI><LI>The Laser cutting files are complete too. The .dwg AutoCAD files have been uploaded.</LI><LI>The code for most of the fluidics is done. The machine transfers specified amounts of fluid.</LI><LI>There is some calibration required for the ethanol flushing part. The variables to be calibrated are given in the code comments. Apart from this, all other fluidics have been done.</LI><LI> Neither a Python CLI nor a GUI has been written. The code currently works with Serial commands from the Arduino IDE window.</LI></OL><P>

We have to admit, the GCODe Pro Documentation is not nearly as extensive as the Mini. This is mostly because of the complexity of the Pro and the number of parts that go together to make it. But it shouldn't be hard for a motivated person who's got a little experience in building stuff from online DIY guides to recreate the current version of the pro from our construction manual. Mind you, don’t bite off more than you can chew! We strongly recommend building the Mini first. (After all, you will have a whole lot of extra time freed from running growth curves then! )

GCODe Pro Code</A>: Source Code for the Pro. Installation works exactly the same way as with the Mini.
</P><P>Total costs will be of the order of $200 - $250, with the same caveats as for the Mini.
</P><H1 id="fab">Fabrication Guide</H1><P>It might be a little intimidating to get PCBs fabricated and to get the parts laser-cut if you haven't done it before. So here's something to get you started.</P><H2>Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Printing</H2><P>
The first step is to find a fabrication lab online, or in your city. Here's an easy place to get you started: <A href="https://easyeda.com/order">easyeda.com</A> [They are not sponsoring us]
</P><P>You'll find a zip file containing files in the Gerber format when you download our fabrication files. Gerbers are the standard files used by the PCB industry to describe the PCBs. You have to submit these files to the PCB fabrication facility or - if you're using an online facility like EasyEDA - upload them.</P><P>Check that the files you uploaded are in the correct format. For example, when using EasyEDA, use the &quot;Gerber Viewer&quot; option. after checking they are in the correct format, make your payment and receive the PCBs!</P><H2>Soldering</H2><P>Consult the 3D renders and the PCB pdf files we have given included in the fabrication files pdf when soldering. Soldering irons are hot, so if you're inexperienced get someone else to do it for you.</P><H2>Laser cutting</H2><P>Laser cutting is an extremely easy and efficient prototyping method for beginners. Just find a local laser cutting facility, buy a suitably sized sheet of the material you want (2ft x 2ftx 4mm Black Acrylic worked wonderfully for us) submit the .dwg files, and you're good to go!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
