Team
The Missouri university iGEM team was originally founded in 2007 with a small group of students with similar interests. Since its founding, the iGEM team has rapidly grown over the years. We are currently proud members of the Student Design and Experiential Learning Center, utilizing resources and knowledge to follow a respected campus tradition, working together as a team towards a common goal. The iGEM team is almost entirely student led, with hands on projects under the watch of trained supervisors.
