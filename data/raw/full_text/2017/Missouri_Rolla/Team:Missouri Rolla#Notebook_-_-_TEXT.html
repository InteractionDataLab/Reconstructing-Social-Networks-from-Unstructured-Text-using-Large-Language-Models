Cloning efficiency testing of new Universal Acceptor Plasmid
Purpose: To test the cloning efficiency of the Universal Acceptor Plasmid after deletion of the unexpected 10 bp region via site directed mutagenesis PCR
Protocol:
Golden gate assemblies were performed to insert TNTR3 gblock into our universal acceptor plasmid.  Various molar ratios of TNTR3: Universal acceptor plasmid were tested.  Molar ratios of 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 (recommended ratio), 4:1, and 8:1 were tested for the new plasmid. A 2:1 ratio assembly was performed using our original UAP. A negative control assembly was performed with no inserts added.   Golden gate assemblies contained the following: 1:2 Ratio

All samples were run with the following thermocycler conditions: – 20 seconds @ 37°C, – (3 minutes @ 37°C, 4 minutes @ 16°C) X26 – 5 minutes @ 50°C – 5 minutes @ 80°C – 5 minutes @ 16°C  Following assembly, 1 uL of each sample was transformed on to Chloramphenicol Blue-White Screening plates following Intact Genomics ig 5-Alpha chemically competent cell High efficiency Transformation protocol. Dillutions of 20% and 5% were plated and spread using sterile glass beads. A positive control transformation was performed using 1 uL of original UAP.   Colonies were incubated at 37C for 30 hours.   Blue and white colonies were counted on all plates.

Addition of Promoter and Terminator to PhoR, PhoB, and TNTR3
Purpose: Addition of BBa_K1467101 Promoter and BBa_K1618037 Terminator to PhoR, PhoB, and TNTR3 into BBa_P10501 Alpha 1 acceptor plasmid via golden gate assembly using NEB golden gate assembly kit.
Protocol:
20 uL Reactions were set up following NEB golden gate assembly mix using 75ng of BBa_P10501 as the destination plasmid and 100ng of each insert.   All samples were run at 37C for 1 hour followed by 55C for 5 minutes.   1 uL of each assembly were transformed using NEB® 5-alpha Competent E. coli (High Efficiency) protocol.   20% and 2% dilutions were then plated on Kanamysin selective blue white screening plates.
Stop: 7:00PM
