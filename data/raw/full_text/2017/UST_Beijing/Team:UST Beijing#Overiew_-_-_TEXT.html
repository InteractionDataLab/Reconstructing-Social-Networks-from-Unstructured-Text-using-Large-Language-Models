PanGu Cyclase Overview
Background
  We are going to compare and assess the 1w6k and ginseng cyclase through Pangu algorithm. Next, we will combine the first 90 nucleotides from 1w6k and skeleton of ginseng cyclase together, and we receive our final product called “Pangu cyclase”.We used PCR to amplificate the DNA fragments and isolated the DNA sequence of 2224bp.The target segment and the plasmid backbone of pSB1C3 were digested by the PstI ang EcoRI enzyme respectively. Then we used T4 DNA ligase to connect the backbone and target fragment. The electrophoresis showed our designed plasmid.
