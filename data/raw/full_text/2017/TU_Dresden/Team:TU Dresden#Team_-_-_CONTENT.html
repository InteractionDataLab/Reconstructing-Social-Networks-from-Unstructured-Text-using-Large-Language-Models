Nina is our most experienced lab member who keeps an open ear for everyone and helps in every situation – she often saved us from totally ruining our own experiments! Putting all of her power in creating a completely new <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/Project/Biosensor">Beta-lactam biosensor</A> in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>, to get the best results, she spent countless hours in the lab. Furthermore, she runs our Instagram profile, planned parts of our travel and organized a lot of the funding from sponsors. Our beautiful team logo also originates from her pen. Additionally, she is a member of our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/iGEM-goes-green">iGEM goes green</A> team and won a photo competition with one of her nice <A target="_blank" href="https://500px.com/ninalautenschlger">snapshots</A> that enabled us to compensate for our flights to Boston.

With idealism and stamina, she puts all her effort in the achievement of our team´s goals, while inspiring others to give their best. She is always a source of creative ideas and led the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/Project/Secretion">“Secretion”</A> subproject to success. She also came up with the idea for the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/iGEM-goes-green">iGEM goes green</A> initiative and contributed greatly to it´s accomplishments.

The main interest of the department is how microorganisms communicate with, and respond to changes occurring within their environment. As a Professor of Synthetic Microbiology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, he has already supervised four LMU-Munich iGEM teams (<A target="_blank" href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:TU Dresden">2010</A>, <A target="_blank" href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:LMU-Munich">2011</A>, <A target="_blank" href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:LMU-Munich">2012</A>, and <A target="_blank" href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:LMU-Munich">2014</A>). Together with his co-workers and iGEM-alumni Franzi and Philipp, he just had to continue iGEMming after moving to Dresden, reflecting his engagement and heart blood for iGEM competitions. 2017 is his first TU Dresden team.
