The minimized SpyCatcher
Minimization
The SpyCatcher is a highly functional Tag, that can interact with its protein partner: the SpyTag. Upon interaction, additional C- or N-terminally translational fused proteins are brought in close proximity and can be linked together via this Tag system. Unfortunately the size of the SpyCatcher (116 amino acid) is quite large and can therefore hinder the native folding of a linked protein of interest. We submitted a minimized version of the  Spy Catcher ( mini. SpyCatcher ) to the registry to ensure the effective secretion necessary for our project. The mini. SpyCatcher is 32 amino acids shorter but still fully functional, which was proven by our team (have a look at our results ) as well as by the researchers that proposed the minimization.
Codon adaption
The original part was used in Escherichia coli but the mini. SpyCatcher was thought to be implemented throughout our project in Bacillus subtilis. Therefore we codon adapted the sequence for this purposes. The sequence was proposed by researchers that investigated the secretion of SpyTag/SpyCatcher system in B. subtilis.
His-Tag
The mini. SpyCatcher was also submitted to the registry with an added C-terminal His-Tag to purify protein constructs when SpyTag/SpyCatcher link together.
