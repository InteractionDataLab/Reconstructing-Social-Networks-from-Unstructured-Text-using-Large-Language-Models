We are creating cages containing a liquid environment inside. The mesh-like structure of the cage allows the selective exchange of compounds via diffusion. Therefore, we are able to benefit from the entrapped cells’ abilities, while still ensuring that they are not released into their surroundings.
Peptidosomes can be further enhanced by incorporating magnetic or biological beads – which are also functionalized with proteins – into their peptide-based fibrillary shell.</P><H2> Achievements</H2><P>We proved that we are able to produce stable Peptidosomes with the sizes of 1 µL to 20 µL (Figure 1). Furthermore we showed that diffusion between the inside of the Peptidosomes and the environment is possible (Figure 2). This was crucial because it is necessary to make fresh nutrients available for the organism and to allow the release of secreted molecules of interest out of the peptidosome while keeping the bacteria inside.</P><P>As demonstrated with different methods, we are able to encapsulate bacteria inside the Peptidosome and detect them, i.e. with the plate reader well-scan technique (Figure 3). In addition we proved that the bacteria can also grow inside the Peptidosome.</P><P>By trapping Dynabeads inside the shell and attaching molecules to them we managed to decorate the surface (Figure 4).</P><FIGURE><FIGURE class="makeresponsive floatleft" style="width: 23.60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1: Different sizes of Peptidosomes</B></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE class="makeresponsive floatleft" style="width: 29.906%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2: Diffusion between the inside of the Peptidosomes and the surrounding environment.</B> The peptidosomes are shown directly after transfer in water (transparent liquid) or LB medium (yellowish liquid) and after 30 minutes.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE class="makeresponsive floatleft" style="width: 23.094%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 3: Well scan of a Peptidosome with loaded bacteria expressing sfGFP:</B> A results of the well-scan measurement for the detection of fluorescence is shown.

To simplify the search for new antibiotics and to track the antibiotic pollution in water samples, whole-cell biosensors constitute a helpful investigative tool. In this part of EncaBcillus, we developed a functional and independent heterologous Beta-lactam biosensor in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>. These specialised cells are capable of sensing a compound of the beta-lactam family and will respond by the production of an easily measurable luminescence signal. We analysed the detection range and sensitivity of the biosensor in response to six different Beta-lactam antibiotics from various subclasses. The evaluated biosensor was then encapsulated into Peptidosomes to proof the concept of our project EncaBcillus. The encapsulation of engineered bacteria allows a simplified handling and increased biosafety, potentially raising the chances for their application in e.g. sewage treatment plants.</P><H2>Achievements</H2><P>In this part of the EncaBcillus project, we successfully created and evaluated a novel completely heterologous biosensor for Beta-lactam antibiotics in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>. This biosensor is able to detect the following Beta-Lactam antibiotics: ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefperazone, cefalexin. cefoxitin and penicillin G in liquid and on solid MH-Medium. Besides the detection range, we analyzed the sensitivity of the biosensor for these specific compounds in several dose-response experiments shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of the biosensor when encapsulated into Peptidosomes. As depicted in Figure 6, the biosensor was able to sense the beta-lactam diffusing through the membrane of the Peptidosome. Hereby, we proved the possibility of encapsulating functional engineered bacteria into Peptidosomes.

The secretion efficiency is not determined by the sequence of the SP alone, but instead is the combined result of an SP with its specific target protein. This necessitates establishing efficient screening procedures to evaluate all possible SP/target protein combinations. We developed such an approach for our Signal Peptide Toolbox, which contains 74 Sec-dependent SPs. It combines combinatorial construction with highly reproducible, quantitative measurements. By applying this procedure, we demonstrate the secretion of three different proteins and succeeded in identifying the most potent SP-protein combination for each of them. This thoroughly evaluated measurement tool, in combination with our SP toolbox (fully available via the Parts Registry) enables an organism-independent, straightforward approach to identifying the best combination of SP with any protein of interest.</P><H2>Achievements</H2><P>We evaluated and proved the applicability of a powerful toolbox to quickly screen via a high throughput procedure for improved secretion of proteins in bacteria - the Signal Peptide Toolbox.
