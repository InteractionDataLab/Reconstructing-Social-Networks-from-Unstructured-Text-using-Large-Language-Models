Our Achievements
We are very proud of what we achieved this year: Our project was awarded a gold medal, acknowledging the overall quality of our work. In addition we were nominated for 4 special prices:
Best Foundational Advance Project
Best Part Collection
Best New Basic Part
Best Poster
Especially the nomination for Best Part Collection made us very happy, as our Signal Peptide Toolbox , with which we applied for that award, has truely been a team endeavour with every single team member contributing to it.
About Judging
For the iGEM competition, all teams must convince the judges of completing the requirements for achieving bronze, silver or gold as a rating for their project. iGEMers register their teams in March and work all summer to check off these requirements and prepare to defend their claims in Boston, at the Hynes Convention Center. Teams also need to complete a poster, wiki page and present at the Giant Jamboree in addition to other tasks to get the medal. You can hover over the UFOs below, to see our medal check-offs. Please see the Judging Criteria , for more information on medals.
In addition to that, teams with excellent results in specific areas can get nominated for and win special prizes in numerous categories. Last but not least the very best team in each of the 3 age groups is awarded the Grand Prize. An overview of 2017's special prizes, the nominees and winners can be found at the iGEM 2017 results page .
