Science influences very different aspects of our daily life. It is critical to health, economics, food security, and safety. Being part of an iGEM team brings us even closer in touch with what it means to be a scientist and how important the acknowledgement from public policy and society is for our work. </P><P>
To celebrate and strengthen the role of science in policy making, our iGEM team joined the March for Science in Dresden on April 22, 2017. The initial “Scientists March on Washington” was supported by a series of marches in more than 600 other cities all around the globe.
The main goals of the march were to support evidence-based policy making, government funded research and transparency in science. </P><P>
As young scientists, we walked through the baroque city center of Dresden to demonstrate what value scientific research has for our community and that scientifically proven facts should be taken more seriously in political decisions. The acceptance of the consensus on climate change and evolution has also been one of our major concerns which is why we put a lot of effort into our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/iGEM-goes-green"> iGEM goes green</A> initiative. Taken together it has been a remarkable experience to show solidarity with the world wide scientific community and to stand up for our values and interests - We marched forward with Science. </P></FIGURE><P>

While planning our iGEM project, we thought that only considering environmental implications of our project was not enough. We decided that we want to take responsibility for the environmental impact of our whole project from our lab work to our flights to Boston. Therefore, we started the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/iGEM-goes-green" style="color:green">“iGEM goes green”</A> initiative aiming for a more sustainable iGEM competition and research in general. With iGEM goes green we want to share the ecological improvements of our work and encourage as many teams and research groups as possible to get involved.</FIGURE><P>We spent a lot of time investigating options and possibilities for planting trees, getting familiar with CO<SUB>2</SUB> compensation as well as looking for collaboration partners and support. 
We got in contact with some experts in the field of sustainability and exchanged views with the existing community in order to learn how to track our green house gas (GHG) emissions, how to reduce them and how to share our results with the world:</P><H2>Sustainability experts</H2><H3>Toni Kiel</H3><H4>Founder of <A target="_blank" href="https://www.plant-values.de/" style="color:green">plant values</A>, a business consultancy for sustainable company development</H4><FIGURE>

When we decided to calculate the carbon footprint of our lab work, we soon realized that we would need some help and expertise. Therefore, we got in contact with Toni Kiel, a business consultant for sustainability. Since he has a bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biotechnology he was keen on supporting our idea from the very beginning. In our first meeting, he introduced a concept for structuring the tracking of our emissions to us. He accompanied the development of our calculation tool for weeks and provided us with helpful sources and professional advice. Furthermore, he helped us to establish contacts to further experts. Thanks to his advice and support we could actually calculate the GHG emission of our lab work and develop <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/iGEM-goes-green/Resources" style="color:green"><B>&quot;The iGEM goes green GHG Emissions Calculator&quot;</B></A> that we provide to the iGEM community as well as to scientists all over the world. </FIGURE><H3>Stephan Schöps and Dr. Ines Herr</H3><H4>Dept.

At the beginning iGEM goes green, we had no idea about what is needed to calculate our carbon footprint. In a discussion with experts from the Environmental Management of our university, details and the huge effort that is connected to our aim were revealed. They provided us with contact information and checked whether general energy consumption data of the biology building, and our lab were available (unfortunately this was not the case). Especially in the beginning, they supported us to define our aims in the initiative. Later, they were always available as contact persons. In return, they received our collected data about energy consumption of biological laboratories. </FIGURE><H3>Nicole Kelesoglu</H3><H4>Editor and blogger of <A target="_blank" href="http://www.labconscious.com/" style="color:green">Labconscious</A>, an open resource website for scientists in green lab initiatives</H4><FIGURE><P>While researching into sustainable lab work we discovered that there is already a community that shares our concern: Labconsious, an open resource supporting researchers using green lab initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of bench science supported by New England Biolabs (NEB).

She appreciated our work and gave us a lot of helpful input. With her large knowledge and experience in the field of sustainable lab work, we were able to extend our GoGreenGuide.

As our team aims at applying encapsulated bacteria in facilities other than our laboratories we had to consider the biological safety of our project. Therefore, we met with the legal assistant Ms K. Michalk from the Institute for Technological and Environmental Law at TU Dresden. She informed us about the procedure during the safety evaluation of a biological project and what is needed to make our Peptidosomes with the encapsulated biosensor applicable in e.g. a sewage treatment plant. According to her provisional assessment, the encapsulation of the biosensor into Peptidosomes represents a huge improvement in contrast to a biosensor that is placed on the market without further immobilization. She estimates this additional safety measure as pivotal for the potential prospective approval for a placement on the market. However, she also recommends the installation of further safety levels into our proposed portable system described <A target="_blank" href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/Safety">here</A>. Hereby, so-called indestructible materials could be suitable, preventing bacteria from escaping the system. </FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="contentbox"><H1 id="LNS" class="box-heading">Long Night of Sciences</H1><H4>16 June 2017 </H4><FIGURE><P>As part of giving back to the community, we hosted a booth at the Long Night of Sciences, an annually event taking place in many cities throughout Germany. We focused on introducing iGEM and synthetic biology to the public in Dresden. We tried to increase awareness of the beauty and ethics behind the things we do. To keep all ages entertained, we had Legos and gave instructions to kids on how to build BioBricks. Different colors of big bricks corresponded to different genes, like fluorescent proteins, smaller bricks corresponded to different promoters and so on. </P><P>
We also offered strawberry DNA extraction, where kids could extract DNA by mashing them with their hands in bag of soap and then extracting the DNA in cold ethanol. As the children were entertained with their Legos and strawberry pounding, we presented our project in synthetic biology to their parents and all the visitors of the Long Night of Sciences. People were introduced to the latest research in biotechnology and expressed their deep interest in BioBricks and synthetic biology in general. At the end of the day, successful young scientists were able to take home a tube of strawberry DNA and parents were left in awe of newly acquired kids' skills. </P><P>Some impressions: </P></FIGURE></DIV><DIV class="contentbox"><H1>Public Engagement</H1><P>To spread the word about synthetic biology and our project EncaBcillus, one of our team members went to her former school, the Rudolf-Hildebrand-Schule in Markkleeberg (a town close to Leipzig).
