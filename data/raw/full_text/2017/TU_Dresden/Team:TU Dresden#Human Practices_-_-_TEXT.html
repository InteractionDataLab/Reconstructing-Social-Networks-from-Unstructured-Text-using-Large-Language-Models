Human Practices
"Human Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work." — Peter Carr, Director of Judging (iGEM Measurement Committee)
Projects should have the aim to make the world a better place, and we are sure that Peptidosomes can be used in many applications soon. Still, the question arises how we adapted our project and working with regard to further impact.
To outreach the current status, we talked to experts about making lab work more sustainable and our project applicable outside the lab. For public engagement, we participated in the March for Science and presented our work at the Long Night of Science in Dresden.
Nevertheless, speaking reaches not far enough and we therefore aimed further with taking actions and integrating our knowledge, especially reagarding the iGEM goes green initiative.
As collaborating with other teams means exchanging ideas and helping each other, they doubtlessly belong to the field of Human Practices.
