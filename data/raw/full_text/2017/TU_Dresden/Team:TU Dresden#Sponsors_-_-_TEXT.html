Thanks to our Sponsors!
The TU Dresden iGEM team has received an incredible amount of support from our sponsors. Without this support we would not have been able to afford all our lab materials, the flight to Boston, or even the registration fees. Our sponsors are what made our project feasible, and for that we thank them greatly.
