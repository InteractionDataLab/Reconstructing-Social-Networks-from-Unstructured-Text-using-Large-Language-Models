By using Peptidosomes we introduce a new powerful platform for co-culturing. This technique physically separates bacterial populations without limiting their ability to communicate with each other via signaling molecules. This part of EncaBcillus is focused on proving the concept of communication between encapsulated bacteria by making use of the native regulatory system for competence development in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> which is based on quorum sensing.
</P></DIV><DIV class="contentbox"><H1 id="background" class="box-heading">Background</H1><P> 
In order to solve complex tasks, it is reasonable to break down a problem into small subunits that can be addressed by specialists individually. This concept is widely implemented in modern economy but can also be applied to synthetic 
biology <A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829281">[1]</A>. In nature, such strategies have been evolved over millions of years. A good example is the formation of biofilms by the gram-positive bacterium <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>. Here, cell-cell interactions lead to cellular differentiation processes, which results in an effective division of labour <A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4188541/">[2]</A>.
However, development of synthetic consortia consisting of several different bacterial strains, with each executing distinct tasks remains challenging <A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18675483">[3]</A>. 
</P><P>
By encapsulating subpopulations within molecular cages, called <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/Project/Peptidosomes">Peptidosomes</A>, we want to physically separate co-working bacteria while still assuring their cooperativity to fulfil one major task. In this context communication between the bacteria is indispensable, thus we had to make sure that the Peptidosome membrane is permeable for small molecules and that the bacteria are still able to interact with each other. In this part of EncaBcillus we will show that the encapsulation of one population does not limit its ability to communicate with cells in the surrounding medium.</P><H3>The regulatory system for competence development in <I><B>B. subtilis</B></I></H3><FIGURE><FIGURE class="makeresponsive floatright" style="width: 60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1: The regulatory system for competence development in <I><B>Bacillus subtilis</B></I>.</B> The development of genetic competence is stimulated by quorum sensing due to the secretion of the ComX pheromone and its accumulation in the surrounding medium. (Modified from: <A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511326">Jung <I>et al.</I></A>)</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
The well-studied regulatory system for competence development in <I>B. subtilis</I> provided a genetic set-up based on quorum sensing that we used as a proof of principle (Figure 1). <A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12576575">[4]</A><I>B. subtilis</I> constantly secretes the ComX pheromone, a 9- to 10-amino acid oligopeptide, as a signaling molecule <B>(a)</B>. By rising cell-density, the ComX-concentration in the surrounding medium increases until it reaches a threshold and activates ComP, a membrane-spanning protein kinase <B>(b)</B>. 
The kinase reacts to the accumulation of ComX by phosphorylating the response regulator ComA <B>(c)</B> which then works as a transcription factor by binding to several promoters and enhancing their activity <B>(d)</B><A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26582911">[5</A>,<A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18585392">6]</A>.</P><P>
The most important promoter regulated by ComA and involved in competence development is the promoter of the <I>srfA</I> operon. This operon contains not only genes for the production of the antibiotic surfactin <B>(e)</B> but also for ComS <B>(f)</B>, another small peptide that prevents the degradation of the autoregulated transcription factor ComK <B>(g)</B>.
ComK activates expression of more than 100 genes, including <I>comG</I>, that is part of the transformation machinery <B>(h)</B><A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16091051">[7,</A><A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14762007">8]</A>. Consequently, <I>B. subtilis</I> can take up DNA from the environment either as direct nutrient source or incorporate the DNA via homologues recombination into its own genome.</P></FIGURE><H3>Communication between encapsulated bacteria and bacteria in the surroundings </H3><FIGURE><FIGURE class="makeresponsive floatright" style="width:60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2: Illustration of co-cultured sender (ReSt) and receiver strain (SeSt) using Peptidosomes.</B> The SeSt in the surrounding medium secretes the ComX quorum sensing pheromone that diffuses through the membrane into the Peptidosome and stimulates the encapsulated, comX-deficient ReSt.  As a result, the ReSt produces luminescence driven by a ComX-dependant promoter upstream the lux operon.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
Based on this genetic background, we wanted to set up a simple experiment that shows communication between two <I>B. subtilis</I> strains. The basic idea is comparable to a radio broadcast: you need a transmitter that sends out the radio waves and a receiver that receives the waves and converts them into an acoustical signal. Transferring this idea over to our project means that we need a sender strain (SeSt) that secretes the ComX pheromone, and a receiver strain (ReSt) that reacts to the ComX-stimulation with an easy-detectable output (Figure 2).</P><P>
In our setup, we fused target promoters of the competence machinery of <I>B. subtilis</I> to the <I>lux</I> operon and measured luminescence output. Additionally, the ReSt needed to be <I>comX</I>-deficient to prevent autoinduction. We encapsulated the ReSt within Peptidosomes and incubated it together with the SeSt (either wild type or a ComX-overproducing strain) in the surrounding medium. Thus, we expected ComX that is produced outside the Peptidosme to diffuse through the membrane and stimulate the ReSt. As a result, we should obtain a glowing Peptidosome mediated by the <I>lux</I> operon, which is only present in the ReSt.</P></FIGURE></DIV><DIV id="design" class="contentbox"><H1 class="box-heading">Design</H1><P>After extensive research, an iGEM project starts with designing genetic constructs and planning experiments.

However, in both minimal media (MCSE and MNGE), we could observe a higher increase of luminescence, although there is a temporary decline of activity after 3 hours of incubation in MCSE-medium.

Luminescence was detected via well scan to precisely detect even small changes as well as the spatial extent. We could show that there is only a rise of luminescence if you cultivate the encapsulated ReSt together with the SeSt in the surrounding medium.</P><FIGURE><FIGURE class="makeresponsive floatright" style="width:60%;"><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 11: Co-culture of sender strain (SeSt) and receiver strain (ReSt) using Peptidosomes.

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In Figure 11 A, B and C illustrate the experimental set-up whereas D, E and F display the results of the well scan analysis. While areas with luminescence less or equal the maximal luminescence measured for SeSt (â¤ 40 RLU) are blue-colored, areas with luminescence above SeSt level (â¥ 40 RLU) are pink-colored. Therefore, we can show that the increase of luminescence is restricted to the Peptidosome (Figure 11, E). The mean luminesescence determined for the encapsulated ReSt is 90 RLU. There are few areas with values that are negligibly above the threshold (41 to 62 RLU) causing pink-colored squares located outside the expected position of the Peptidosome. This is a consequence of the chosen threshold and provides no evidence for cells leaving the Peptidosome. </P></FIGURE><H2>Conclusion</H2><P class="survey-quote"><B>Our team has made substantial progress in the evaluation of Peptidosomes as a tool for co-cultivation and studies of microbial interactions. We could prove communication between encapsulated bacteria and bacteria in the surroundings by exchanging signaling molecules (=ComX). Further research about pore sizes of the Peptidosome membrane and diffusion rates needs to be done to tap the full potential of Peptidosomes as a powerful co-culture technique.</B></P></DIV><DIV class="contentbox"><H1 class="box-heading">References</H1><TABLE class="source"><TBODY><TR><TD><A target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24829281">[1]</A></TD><TD> Goers, L., Freemont, P. and Polizzi, K.M.
