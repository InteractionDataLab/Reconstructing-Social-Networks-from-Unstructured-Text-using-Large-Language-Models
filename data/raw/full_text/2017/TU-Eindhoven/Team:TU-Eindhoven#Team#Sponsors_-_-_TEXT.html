ICMS
The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) aims to become the leading international multidisciplinary institute for research and education by combining the fields of mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and engineering to understand complex molecular systems. To achieve this goal, the ICMS does not only perform top research, but also trains young scientists, organizes interdisciplinary science activities and provides an advanced study center. Not only has the ICMS provided us with funding for our project, she has also provided our team with an office to work in and has offered support from its staff. We are grateful towards the ICMS for making it possible for our team to attend the Giant Jamboree in Boston! For more information you can contact the ICMS Website.
IBA Lifesciences
IBA Lifesciences is a biotechnology company providing custom specific services and products for life science research in academia and industry worldwide. IBA focusses on three business segments: cell selection, protein purification and oligo custom services. The company is the original manufacturer and supplier of the Strep-tag®/Strep-Tactin® technology, an affinity chromatography system developed for protein purification. The method is based on one of the strongest non-covalent interactions in nature, which is the interaction of biotin to streptavidin. An intrinsic binding affinity of the Strep-tag® towards Strep-Tactin® results in a highly specific interaction, which enables the isolation and purification of proteins in a native state as wells as intact protein complexes. Recently, the method was further developed to be used for cell selection from whole blood or other single cell suspensions (Fab-TACS, Fab-Traceless Affinity Cell Selection). For more information contact the IBA Lifesciences website.
