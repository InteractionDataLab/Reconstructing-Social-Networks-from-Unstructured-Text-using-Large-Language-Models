IBA focusses on three business segments: cell selection, protein purification and oligo custom services. The company is the original manufacturer and supplier of the Strep-tag®/Strep-Tactin® technology, an affinity chromatography system developed for protein purification. The method is based on one of the strongest non-covalent interactions in nature, which is the interaction of biotin to streptavidin. An intrinsic binding affinity of the Strep-tag® towards Strep-Tactin® results in a highly specific interaction, which enables the isolation and purification of proteins in a native state as wells as intact protein complexes. Recently, the method was further developed to be used for cell selection from whole blood or other single cell suspensions (Fab-TACS, Fab-Traceless Affinity Cell Selection).
