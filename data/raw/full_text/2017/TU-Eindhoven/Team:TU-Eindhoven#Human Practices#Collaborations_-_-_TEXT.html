Postcard Exchange
From iGEM team Duesseldorf Cologne 2017 we were invited to participate in this yearâ€™s Postcard Exchange. Last year seven iGEM teams from Germany decided to join this Exchange and this year teams from all over Europe have joined! Since iGEM is not only about lab work but also about spreading the knowledge about synthetic biology into society, each team was asked to make a postcard depicting their project or more general a subject from synthetic biology. On the back of the postcard, a small informational text can also be found. This was a very easy and fun way to incorporate outreach into our project! Every team also received a batch of postcards from all the other participating teams. It was very interesting to see the postcards from the other teams and made us curious for the presentations at the Giant Jamboree.
Potsdam
With the iGEM team from Potsdam we had a Skype call, since their project showed some similarities to ours. In their first abstract, they were going to investigate two approaches for metabolic channeling, one of which included the usage of liquid liquid phase separation.
Excited about the fact that we found a project similar to ours, we decided to set up a Skype call. We talked about our projects and exchanged some ideas about Human Practices. Since the project of Potsdam is also more foundational, they also struggled somewhat with explaining it to people. They gave us the tip to work towards a good application, which makes it easier to explain it to people. Next to that, we also gave them some tips about working with the WIKI in HTML and CSS and they also set us up with a contact person for our model.
Waterloo
Additionally we answered a survey from the Waterloo iGEM team. This survey was about the customizability and price of current lab materials. It was aimed to see if 3D printing was a good solution to overcome financial problems which might limit teams in their performance.
