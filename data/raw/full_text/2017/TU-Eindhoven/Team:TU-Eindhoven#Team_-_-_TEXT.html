Team
We are seven students from the University of Technology Eindhoven. Together we are one of the official student teams of this university. This year we had the opportunity to participate in the iGEM competition. We were all very motivated to do this because of our common interest synthetic biology and we all liked to develop other skills like presenting, working together or talking to companies for sponsoring.
Although we were very driven to get nice results, we could not have done this alone. Our advisors were a big help. We also could not have done this without all our sponsors.
If you want to know more about what we did in the past few months, read our notebooks.
