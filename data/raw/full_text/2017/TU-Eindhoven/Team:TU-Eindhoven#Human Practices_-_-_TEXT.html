Human Practices
Introduction
Human Practices is an important part of the iGEM competition. In this part of our project, we thought about the safety and possible issues of our project. In order to do this, we made an application scenario , talked to stakeholders and we looked at Safe by Design . To start a dialogue with people about synthetic biology and to expand their knowledge on synthetic biology, we attended events for our outreach .
