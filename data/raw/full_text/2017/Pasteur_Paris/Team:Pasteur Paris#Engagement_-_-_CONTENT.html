People who visited a stand would receive a clue about the location of the next step. The principle of ​​this event was to educate the participants in a fun way and to make sure that the ballad would be accessible to children accompanied by their parents, adults or people with reduced mobility. At the end of the event, we drew lots among the people who solved the final puzzle: &quot;Biologie de synthèse&quot; (synthetic biology in French).

To do so, we filed a request to occupy the public space with the Paris City Hall and the Paris police headquarters, since our journey passed through places as famous as Notre Dame de Paris, the Pantheon, the Senate, Boulevard Saint-Michel ... At each step of the treasure hunt, there was also a safety officer that could immediately report to the police if there were any accident.</P><P class="maintextsuite">In addition, this event received compliments from the Mayor of Paris, who said on Twitter: &quot;Congratulations to the team of the @ iGEM_Pasteur for this educational and fun action on the #Pollution of the air&quot; and was underlined by several national newspapers: Le Parisien and 20 Minutes.</P><P class="maintextsuite">This innovative event has allowed us to establish a dialogue outside the laboratory.

He also described the energy autonomy of our product as a great advantage for some emerging countries, where access to electricity is not always guaranteed. He told us that it would be interesting to have a first commercial phase (in the scenario, we considered rather a free distribution) on a smaller scale (10,000 copies for example). Such an approach would show the politicians that there is an appetite for the general public and that there is a real solution to the problem of indoor air pollution.
