Our Giant Jamboree
In November 2018 our team was happy to attend the 2017 Giant Jamboree of the iGEM competition. We presented our poster and our 3D printed model and both juries and iGEMers showed great interest for our project!
Medals
We were awarded a Bronze Medal for our project Aether.
Eventhough this is the end of the iGEM for us we will keep on working on Aether, so keep following us!
