BBa_K2198000:E1_1 The naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase part 1 (E1_1) from Pseudomonas putida Ref. [1.A]
Forms a complex with naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase part 2 (E1_2) to form an active enzyme to oxidize PAH that can be used as substrate. This oxidation with dioxygen form a vicinal diol and add two hydrogens on the ring. This step need energy to break the aromaticity. This complex enzyme need NADH,H+.
BBa_K2198001:E1_2 The naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase part 1 (E1_2) from Pseudomonas putida Ref. [1.B]
Gets complex with naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase part 1 (E1_1) to form an active enzyme to oxidize PAH that can be used as substrate. This oxidation with dioxygen form a vicinal diol and add two hydrogens on the ring. This step need energy to break the aromaticity. This complex enzyme need NADH,H+.
BBa_K2198002:E2 The dihydrodiol dehydrogenase from Ralstonia sp. Ref. [2]
This step allows the restoration of the aromatic with a dehydrogenation of the vicinal diol. Thanks to this, E3 will be able to open the ring with an oxidative cleavage.
BBa_K2198003:E3 The catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida Ref. [3]
In our degradation pathway the key step is to remove ring from PAH to reduce their toxicity. The E3 is able to do an extradiol ring cleavage. Thanks to this step, the PAH are now less toxic and available for an alkyl removal by E4. If this step is the last one of the process all the products can be handle by chemistry thanks to this alkyl chain. Furthermore E3 can begin an iterative degradation with E4 if the E4 main product enter in the range of substrate specificity.
BBa_K2198004:E4 The trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvate hydratase-aldolase from Nocardioides sp Ref. [4]
The last step of our degradation pathway allow us to remove a ring from the PAH by producing a py-ruvic acid. This product is a common harmless cell intermediate molecule. Moreover, this step pro-duce a smaller PAH if there is more than 2 ring at the beginning. This second generation PAH can reintegrate the pathway at the previous step thanks to a low substrate specificity E3
BBa_K2198005:S1 The Major ampullate Spidroin 1 (MaSp1) from Euprosthenops australis Ref. [5]
In order to carry out the reaction on a solid support, we designed a scaffold made of spider silk that can polymerize.
Figure 1: Biochemical degradation pathway for Anthracene
The catalytic degradation of PAH is ensured by four enzymes. (E1_1, E1_2) homodimer catalyzes the di-hydroxylation, E2 the dehydrogenation of the vicinal diol, E3 oxidative cleavage of the aromatic cycle and E4 cleavage of a linear unsaturated α-β enone to release a pyruvate molecule.
Open reading frames for the four enzymes were designed using Geneious 11.0.2 Ref. [5] software with Uniprot database sequences. Each sequence was designed with Biobrick prefix and suffix Registry in the 5’ and 3’ regions respectively. In addition, His(6) tag, spacer and TeV cleavage sites were included at the N-terminus for purification and release of the His(6) -tag. BamHI site were inserted in the construct after the prefix and before the suffix respectively for insertion into pET43.1a(+) or pET32a(+) (Merck-Millipore) expression plasmids. Genes were ordered from Eurofins Genomics after sequence optimization for Biobrick and cloning into pET vector compatibility. Sequences were further optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and gene synthesis.
