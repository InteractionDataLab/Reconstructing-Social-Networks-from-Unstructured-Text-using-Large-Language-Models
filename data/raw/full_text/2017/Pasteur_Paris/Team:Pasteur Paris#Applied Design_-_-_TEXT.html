Device
Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we designed an affordable, energy self-sufficient and efficient air purifier to fight indoor air pollution. Our product is composed of eight technical parts.
The interchangeable filter, made from synthetic biology, is held in place in a mount, easy to manipulate thanks to its small grip. This filtering part is then enclosed in a perforated plastic case, allowing air to flow through the object, and removing gross particles such as fibers.
In order to make the product energy self-sufficient, flexible solar cells surround the device’s case. Those cells supply power to a small fan, pulling the air through the filter that will trap and degrade pollutants. Ventilation holes located at the back of the device allows filtered air to extract.
All the parts of the device fit together thanks to a rubber strap, surrounding the whole product. Depending on the user’s preferences, this device can fit on flat surfaces - floor, desk, etc. - or on a wall, by attaching the strap to a stand or to a specially designed wall mounting.
App
A dedicated app for smartphones and tablets comes with the product. This app relays the service surrounding the product : scheduled filter replacement through an agenda, information about indoor air pollution through notifications, advice relating to good behavior through tutorials, etc.
Depending on different criteria, such as home location - close to a highway, to a farm, etc.- or indoor equipment - heating system, etc. -, the app is customizable. By creating his profile, the user will benefit from adapted filters regarding his close environment and local pollutants, more accurate information and advice.
All these design features - product, app and service - allied with the filter’s specificities make Æther’s device low cost and efficient, in comparison with existing air purifiers. For those reasons, Æther could reach everyone’s homes in the very short term. Would you sign for it ?
User Scenario
Two scenarios have been designed. The first one is about working with small groups of people - beta-testers - that will help Æther’s service to provide adapted filters, information and advices to the end user. The second one is about providing these adapted solutions to everyone, thanks to these beta-testers.
Beta-tester scenario :
Æther’s services will send early air purifier kits to volunteers that would apply for beta-testing the product, app and service for free. In exchange, they would help Æther to build a strong knowledge about close environment and local indoor air pollution by sharing their data - location, habitat description, etc.-. Plus, beta-testers will receive an additional filter - activated carbon for a wide range pollutants trapping - to send back to Æther’s laboratory for analysis. Thanks to these data, Æther will be able to design adapted filters for various environments and will be able to build and to provide verified information and advice for an end user living in similar environments.
End user scenario :
A future user could order Æther’s device and apply to the service thanks to a dedicated website. After completing his profile, the user will be about to receive a kit including :
- a self assembly kit of the air purifier ;
- an envelope containing an adapted filter and gloves ;
- a smartphone/digital tablet app.
Through the app, the user will be guided through the next stages. Once the product is assembled, the filter introduced and the flexible photovoltaic cells connected, Æther’s device starts trapping and degrading indoor pollutants.
When the filter’s lifetime is over, the user receives a push notification on his smartphone : an invitation to check his mailbox containing a brand new filter. Using provided gloves, he will replace the used filter by the new one. Once done, the device will start again purifying the indoor air and the used filter will be sent to collection centers in order to recover the degraded pollutants as an input for various industries, such as metal industries.
In a nutshell, Æther’s service and product would benefit :
-users health, by providing an affordable and efficient way to fight indoor air pollution through an innovative product, its integrated filter and a service ;
-environment, by feeding industries with pollutants recycled into useful raw materials - metals -, rather than using polluting and harmful extraction/transformation processes.
