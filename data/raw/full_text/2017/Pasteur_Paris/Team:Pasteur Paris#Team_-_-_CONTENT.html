The Mos(kit)o was a kit containing a mosquito trap, a diagnostic patch and a mapping tool. The diagnostic patch was biosilica-based and allowed a quick detection of viruses in mosquitoes.</P><P> For the third year in a row, the Institut Pasteur hosts a multidisciplinary team composed of Biology (UPMC), Chemistry (Chimie ParisTech), Engineering (CentraleSupélec, Ecole Polytechnique, ESPCI) but also Industrial Design (ENSCI-Les Ateliers), and Intellectual Property Law students (Faculté Jean Monnet, Paris-Saclay University). Two supervisors are also taking part in the adventure with us: Deshmukh Gopaul, Head Design for Biology Center Education Department at the Institut Pasteur, and Guillian Graves, designer in new technologies and teacher at the ENSCI – Les Ateliers. After the success of the 2015 and 2016 teams we have all the assets needed to maintain momentum.
