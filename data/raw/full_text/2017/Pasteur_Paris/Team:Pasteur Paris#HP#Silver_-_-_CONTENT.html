Throughout our project, we adopted a lean startup methodology, building our device and our scenario by successive iterations. We conducted a large survey about the use of synthetic biology to fight air pollution, which received more than 2 300 answers worldwide. We also met the French actors of the fight against air pollution, such as the French Ministry of the Environment, city agencies, scientists, medical professionals and associations. It allowed us to present and review our project, check our assumptions and integrate their feedback to our device. To show that we have now gathered a solid knowledge of the air pollution ecosystem, we have regrouped our findings in a socio-economic legal report.

But only about 14% of them are actually protect themselves against this plague (excepted in Asia where most of the people use protections, either it being masks or air purifiers). In this global study, we realized that there was a real need for our device and that people all over the world (especially in Asia and Africa), were interested in a solution using synthetic biology. However, 57% of respondents who were interested in a solution based on synthetic biology thought it is not a safe science. We wanted to better understand the point of view of these people, so we asked a series of more in-depth questions on the subject, which we analyzed at the European level.</P><OL style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size:11pt;padding-left:0%"><B>  Collaborative Design of a representative sample in partnership with UChile iGEM Team</B></OL><P class="maintextsuite"><B>After numerous discussions with our partners from the UChile_OpenBio-CeBiB team, we concluded that our results had a problem of representativeness, particularly concerning the age range.

For indoor pollution, even though 43% of people think they are exposed to pollution in their home, more than half do not know if they are affected or think that pollution does not affect them at home. </P><P class="maintextsuite"><B>This observation has strongly influenced our scenario and more particularly our desire to develop an application to raise awareness about the dangers of indoor pollution and create a database of pollutants so that people are aware of the dangers of this scourge. </B></P><P class="maintextsuite">Even though people are aware of the dangers of pollution, especially indoor pollution, most of them do not take measures to fight it. Most do not inquire, or inform themselves passively (TV, Radio). And only 13% of respondents really use protections against air pollution. We can interpret it as follows: pollution is a problem, but a second-area problem, which is not the priority of our fellow citizens at the individual level, which we can compare with the next question of the survey (How do you feel such an issue should be addressed?). Finally, we noted once again that a significant number of participants think that they will avoid air pollution by staying at home: a pedagogical work is therefore strongly necessary.</P><P class="maintextsuite">We asked the previous questions to see if the key concepts of our project were well known to the general public. As we have seen, most respondents think they know what are the fine particles (which we hear a lot about in the media). A large proportion (62%) also thinks they know what an endocrine disruptor is. This result is very high for such a technical term and contrasts with results from other continents, where on average 35% think they know what an endocrine disruptor is. This difference can be explained by the high-profile debates in the European Union on the banning of certain compounds suspected of being endocrine disruptors. After asking these questions, we gave a definition for these terms from a pedagogical perspective.</P><P class="maintextsuite"><I>We gave the following definition for particulate matter: Atmospheric particulates are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. It’s the deadliest form of air pollution due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood stream unfiltered, causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death. [Ref.]</I></P><P class="maintextsuite"><I>We gave the following definition for endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere at a certain level with your endocrine (or hormone) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders.[Ref.]</I></P><P class="maintextsuite"><B>To conclude these questions about air pollution and its impact on our society, we asked two questions about the solution we are developing. Respondents were asked to rate their interest on a scale of 1 (not interested) to 5 (I'm really interested). With an average of 3.89 / 5, it seems that our device meets a strong interest. We also asked the participants which scale seems most effective for combating air pollution. A very large part of the participants thinks the fight against pollution must take place at a local and then global scale. These findings have influenced our scenario, which you can find here. Indeed, we imagined a scenario where global foundations or health organizations take care of aether financing. The product will than have a life cycle on a local scale, between the consumer’s house and the local collect center.
</B></P><P class="maintextsuite">In the overall study, we found that most people were interested in a solution using synthetic biology but that more than half did not think this branch of biology was safe. We observed similar conclusions in our European subsample. We have therefore conducted our investigations further to better understand this finding and to raise awareness among people with limited knowledge. We asked questions to evaluate the knowledge of people regarding synthetic biology and see if they would accept a solution based on it.  </P><P class="maintextsuite">As can be seen, a vast majority of respondents, more than 69%, do not know the term &quot;synthetic biology&quot;, while on the contrary, 97% of respondents think they know what a &quot;GMO&quot;. The word GMO, associated with several scandals including food, is connoted very negatively in Europe. Looking at the third graph, we can see that the majority of interviewees do not have any problem with GMOs and consider that they are a great technical tool to address certain issues linked to health, environment or energy. What annoys most respondents is the fact that this is a new science that we do not have enough perspective to judge the effects. They are also concerned that GMOs are released into the wild and have an unintended effect. We realized the importance of communicating around the safety of our device and the fact that we produce GMOs, but we do not take them out of the laboratory.</P><P class="maintextsuite"><I>We gave the following definitions on Synthetic biology: “Synthetic biology is a field in biology where biological functions found in living systems of nature, are used as solutions to address technical issues in various areas such as health, environment, basic science or new energies.” And also explained about the production of GMO’s:”Researchers modify an organism, like a bacteria’s DNA, to give it new properties such as the ability to produce a medicine (synthesis of insulin), depollute, emit fluorescence or the ability to detect viruses.”</I></P><P class="maintextsuite">Further, :”GMO: A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. GMOs are used to produce many medications, genetically modified foods, to produce other goods and are widely used in scientific research.”</P><P class="maintextsuite">We then asked the participant what he thinks about synthetic biology based on what he knows or what he learnt from the definition. 73% of participants had a positive opinion while 6% had a negative opinion. This change can be interpreted in two ways:
- Our definition, not very objective, biased the opinion of the participants;
- Our definition allowed to associate a meaning to the word &quot;synthetic biology&quot; and thus reduced the fear of the unknown experienced by a large proportion of participants.
</P><P class="maintextsuite">In order to improve the understanding of synthetic biology of the participant we gave him two examples of synthetic biology applications (two past iGEM projects).</P><P class="maintextsuite">Example 1: An example for the use of synthetic biology is iGEM Paris Bettencourt's 2015 project. They improved an Indian dish by adding vitamins and nutriments produced by living bacteria (originally obtained from the fermented food itself), to help spread those nutriments among Indian people. The bacteria are killed before the meal is consumed.</P><P class="maintextsuite">Example 2: Another application for synthetic biology is the use of genetically modified bacteria to bait and eliminate bee killing parasites.</P><P class="maintextsuite"><I>In conclusion, this large questionnaire, which has received more than 2300 responses worldwide, has allowed us to better understand our subject, air pollution, and how a solution using synthetic biology would be received by the society. While most participants are interested in the potential of synthetic biology, many ask for safety guarantees. We identified a problem of lack of information about indoor air pollution. This questionnaire also confirmed the need for our solution and influenced our application scenario (we chose to act on a local/global scale and to add in our device an application to sensitize and inform the user about his air quality depending on features of his housing).</I></P><DIV class="subtitle"><P style="font-family: MinionPro, serif; font-size : 18pt">Meetings with institutional actors and experts in various fields</P></DIV><P class="maintext">We also present the solution aether to a number of actors in the fight against pollution.

He also described the energy autonomy of our product as a great advantage for some emerging countries, where access to electricity is not always guaranteed. He told us that it would be interesting to have a first commercial phase (in the scenario, we considered a free distribution) on a smaller scale (10,000 copies for example). Such an approach would show the politicians that there is a real interest and advantage for the general public and that there is a concrete solution to the problem of indoor air pollution.

Studies have shown multiple correlations between being in contact with air pollution and diseases that implicate inflammatory response or cell multiplication. Those correlations are statistical, and it is nearly impossible to prove scientifically the real impact of pollution over health, as it is only a co-factor (even if some in vitro tests are made). But the idea that both outdoor and indoor pollution impacts on health is generally admitted. A significant step is the 2016 OMS report, which quantify and affirm the correlation between air pollution and risks for human health.</P><P class="maintextsuite">The problem with air pollution is that it’s very difficult to make legislation on it. We have to inform, educate and act for a real change. We then asked him about the recent European decision about endocrine disruptors (The EU didn’t set a maximum concentration for endocrine disruptors), Dr Nhân Pham Thi explained to us that this decision is sad and difficult at the same time. Because those pollutants are only co-factors, there is no “truth” about them. You cannot know the limit between setting a realistic level for health and overly restrain the industry. With air pollution, there is always this contradiction between the qualitative approach (everyone agrees that it’s a problem) and the quantitative one (find precise, reliable experiment that shows the real impact of pollution is nearly impossible and would cost a lot).</P><OL style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size:11pt;padding-left:0%">City Hall of Paris</OL><P class="maintextsuite">On September 11th, we presented our project to the City of Paris. Mrs. Caroline Daude, Transport Consultant, and Mr. Serge Orru, WWF France Advisor and Former Director, welcomed us to discuss our project. They were very interested in our project and in the fact that we are a multidisciplinary team. When we have our prototype, we will have to go back to City Hall, to discuss their support for the development of our project. Their remarks also helped us to develop our scenario.

They attended a series of conferences on indoor air quality and could interact with allergy and health specialists and people working on the development of indoor air cleaners. This conference confirmed and backed a conclusion we had formed: there is still too little work and studies on indoor air while it is the most dangerous and toxic. Creating an indoor pollution database would be an excellent initiative. Azéline and Juliette then attended a conference on air purifiers with a presentation of the state of the art existing models. It turned out that systems that have the most chance of success in the future are those that do not consume energy (passive), that do not produce more pollutants after use, and that are not too expensive. Azéline and Juliette then had the opportunity to present our project aether, which received very good feedback.</P><P class="maintextsuite">As you can see, we spent a lot of time outside the laboratory to meet all the actors of the French ecosystem of the fight against air pollution. We were able to meet all these actors because we made ourselves known in the press.

One of the candidates had even directly targeted the endocrine-disruptors. </P><P class="maintextsuite">Once our subject was chosen and the project had begun, our law students, decided to make a report on air pollution and especially on how it affected our society in several aspects. Therefore, they decided to try to explain the political, economic, judicial and social issues when dealing with air pollution.</P><P class="maintextsuite">For this report, we have met with some major players in the French fight against air pollution such as associations but also people working for the French administration such as mayors’ and minister’s counselors (those meetings were described in the last paragraph).</P><P class="maintextsuite">With our project aether, we hope to give a technical solution against air pollution, but we think that technical means cannot do it all. We believe that each and every one should understand what are the main issues related to air pollution. Thus, we designed a report that you can read here:</P><DIV class="subtitle"><P style="font-family:MinionPro, serif;font-size:18pt">The Particulate Matter Hunt</P></DIV><P class="maintext">Finally, after our investigations and meetings, we returned to the general public to share our expertise on the issues of air pollution.
</P><P class="maintextsuite">On September 16th, 2017, we organized an unseen event to raise awareness about the growing issue of air pollution and the stakes of our project. This event: a treasure hunt in the streets of Paris to educate and alert the participants in a fun way to the problem of air pollution and show them how synthetic biology could be a solution to fight this issue.</P><P class="maintextsuite">The hunt was organized as follows: at each stop, the players had to find a clue to solve a riddle, then they had to take part in an activity or a game around a specific theme, held at a booth. Completing a step allowed the participants to receive a clue to the location of the next stage. The main idea was to create ​​an event accessible to a wide range of participants: adults, children, families and people with reduced mobility, to inform and educate the players in a fun way. At the end of the event, we drew lots among the people who solved the final puzzle. The winner was awarded a grand prize: a bike! (Sponsored by Bike in Paris)</P><P class="maintextsuite">The event was supported by several French institutions: The Ministry of the Environment, the Respire association, the Souffle Foundation, Bike in Paris, the Journal des Grandes Ecoles a University newspapers, the Pasteur Institute and the Paris City Hall. The Ministry of the Environment even highlighted our event on their <A href="http://evenements.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/campagnes/evenement/8877" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">website</A></P><P class="maintextsuite">The game was a great success as 108 people registered and nearly 95 participated in the treasure hunt. Like the rest of our project, the security of the players was our top priority. To do so, we filed a request to occupy public space, with the Paris City Hall and the Paris police headquarters. On account of our route passing through famous spots such as Notre Dame de Paris, the Pantheon, the Senate, Boulevard Saint-Michel ... Also at each step of the hunt, there was a safety officer that could immediately inform the police if any accident occurred.</P><P class="maintextsuite">In addition, this event received the congratulations of the Mayor of Paris, who said on Twitter: &quot;Congratulations to the team of the @ iGEM_Pasteur for this educational and fun action on the #Pollution of the air&quot; and was featured in several national newspapers: Le Parisien and 20 Minutes.</P><P class="maintextsuite">This innovative event allowed us to establish a dialogue outside the laboratory. Its playful nature made it possible to start a dialogue and debate openly without any barriers, and discuss in an original way around our synthetic biology project. We also sent a questionnaire to all participants after the game. The results of the 43 responses are presented below.</P><P class="maintextsuite">As we can see, 93% of the participants thought the Hunt for particulate matter, allowed them to discover synthetic biology and learn more about air pollution. All the players appreciated the idea of participating in a treasure hunt to discover a scientific topic. We also asked other questions about our device and took into account the answers while designing our product.</P><P class="maintextsuite">We also asked the following question: From what price would you say this product is too expensive? The average of the answers was 81 €.</P><P class="maintextsuite">Finally, we asked a more technical question about using our Aether product: The filters do not have an unlimited life, we consider the following charging system: The user will receive a notification on his phone indicating that it is necessary to change his filter. He will then replace the old filter with a new filter, and send the used filter to a collection center where it will be analyzed and upgraded. Envelopes specially designed for this purpose will be included in the kit &quot;Aether&quot;.
