Transformation of bacteria DH5α with pet43.1a.C162, for the positive control we will use the plasmid pUC19 + a negative control              according to the transformation protocol except for volumes.
Observations 16h later:
• The culture for the positive test revealed mean bacterial cultures (more than 50) this test confirms our DH5α cells are competent
• The culture for the negative test did not reveal any bacterial culture, which proved that the cells without any plasmids couldn’t survive in an antibiotic based media
• The cell cultures containing pET43.1a.C162 do not present any colonies; there must be a problem with the pET43.1a.C162 solution, because the DH5α cells are truly competent
• By spectroscopy UV-visible using the equipment UV5 Nano Mettler Toledo, at 260 nm with a 1µL sample, we measured a plasmid concentration of 0, the solution used did not contain plasmids, which explains the death of our cultures
