Many thanks to all those who helped us !
We would like to thank the administration and support services of Institut Pasteur for giving us the opportunity to build up our project. We thank the professors and the members of the administration of Institut Pasteur Paris, Ecole Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI Paris), Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Chimie de Paris (Chimie ParisTech), Ecole Polytechnique, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Création Industrielle (ENSCI-Les Ateliers), Jean Monnet Paris Saclay university, Pierre et Marie Curie Paris university (UPMC), Paris Diderot university.
Professional advice
For their most precious professional advice, many thanks to :
Mr. Thomas ALCARAZ (Engineer at the Airparif association, air quality monitoring network), that gave us the opportunity to become a member of the Airlab, a broad ecosystem with a network of actors in the fight against air pollution.
Mr. Patrick DANSET (Founder of R Lab, ARCAAM correspondant) who invited us to the conference on air quality.
Ms. Caroline DAUDE and Mr. Serge ORRU (Councellors for transport and sustainable development of the city of Paris) for helping us with the industrialization process of Aether.
Mr. Hubert HOLIN (Policy advisor long-range transboundary air pollution at General Directorate for Energy and Climate Change, Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea) for giving precious advices about business plans and application scenarios.
Mr. Rémi Pampin (Engineer at ON Semiconductor) for advising us to research about printed electronics, which led to the integration of solar cells into the device.
Dr Nhân PHAM THI (Allergist and researcher at Institut Pasteur) who gave us useful information about the relation between pollution and diseases from a statistical point of view.
Mr. Sebastien VRAY (Spokesperson for the Respire association) for helping us understand the current situation regarding pollution in France.
Pr. Bruno HOUSSET (Head of the Fondation du Souffle, foundation for breathing) who suggested focusing on indoor air pollution.
Lab work
We want to thank Hervé Waxin, head of the Teaching center of Institut Pasteur, and our lab technicians from the Teaching Center of Insitut Pasteur.
Our coaches
Dr. Deshmukh GOPAUL for leading our team in every aspect of the competition. Indeed Dr. Gopaul was a constant guide, counselor, teacher, during this entire 10 month project. He advised us during the whole brainstorming process. He counseled us during the research and bibliography phase. He taught us the protocols for the wet-work. He helped us with the equipment orders and the management of said equipment. He also coached us for oral presentations and pitching potential sponsors.
Guillian GRAVES for providing a significant amount of help and advice for the conception and the 3D printing of the device. He gave us precious information and advice about communication content and visual aspects of the project. He coached us for our presentations. He also guided us during the brainstorming sessions. And he helped us conceive a concrete scenario for our device.
