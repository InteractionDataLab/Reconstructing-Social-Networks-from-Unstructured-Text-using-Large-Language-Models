Welcome to the
team iGEM Pasteur 2017's webpage !
For the third year in a row, the Institut Pasteur hosts a multidisciplinary student team composed of Biology, Chemistry, Engineering but also Industrial Design and Law students. After the success of the 2015 and 2016 teams, which were rewarded by bronze and golden medals respectively, we have all the assets needed to maintain momentum.
Our team's research focuses on the issue of air pollution. This worldwide disaster is responsible for the death of between 7.3 to 9.0 million people per year, according to WHO's 2012 and Lancet 2017 reports. It concerns both indoor and outdoor air, especially in urban areas. Pollution in the domestic setting is a particularly big issue, even in rural areas. Indeed, we spend 80 % or more of our time indoors. Air contamination is also a threat to many ecosystems and infrastructures. Even though there is a rising awareness about the dangers of this issue, too few solutions exist. Our will is to design an innovative, biodegradable and affordable device to fight air pollution.
