Our team
Institut Pasteur's first participation to iGEM in 2015, the PlastiCure project, was rewarded with a bronze medal. PlastiCure was a biological system designed to degrade PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) and use the degradation products to synthesize bio-active compounds.
The second participation, the Mos(kit)o project in 2016, was a great success: it was rewarded with a gold medal and 3 special prizes (Best Applied Design, Best Entrepreneurship et Best Diagnostics). The Mos(kit)o was a kit containing a mosquito trap, a diagnostic patch and a mapping tool. The diagnostic patch was biosilica-based and allowed a quick detection of viruses in mosquitoes.
For the third year in a row, the Institut Pasteur hosts a multidisciplinary team composed of Biology (UPMC), Chemistry (Chimie ParisTech), Engineering (CentraleSupélec, Ecole Polytechnique, ESPCI) but also Industrial Design (ENSCI-Les Ateliers), and Intellectual Property Law students (Faculté Jean Monnet, Paris-Saclay University). Two supervisors are also taking part in the adventure with us: Deshmukh Gopaul, Head Design for Biology Center Education Department at the Institut Pasteur, and Guillian Graves, designer in new technologies and teacher at the ENSCI – Les Ateliers. After the success of the 2015 and 2016 teams we have all the assets needed to maintain momentum.
Team members
Azéline BOUCHER
Azéline BOUCHER
Law student at Faculté Jean-Monnet
Azéline comes from a faraway part of Brittany. She is starting her M2 studies in digital activities rights. Her expertise in intellectual property law is extremely valuable for our team. Moreover, Azéline is a really dynamic person, an excellent cook and an awesome speaker : she's the sun of the group! She also enjoys hiking, talking with her hands and showing around her apartment! So, if you're around Paris, don't hesitate to call her. To conclude, as she likes to say, "Le beauf vaincra!"

Karima BOUCHERKA
Karima BOUCHERKA
Biologist student at the Université Pierre et Marie Curie
Karima is a natural leader: she is the Mom of the whole team, always ready to cheer us up, she is the chief of moral. She is also a really good cook. She is everywhere, the lab does not scare her, nor does organizing a meetup for more than 80 people. Karima is also one of our community manager: her cellphone is always in her hands! To be honest she is such a nice girl, but beware if you talk with her when she is tired, you could be surprised by all the crazy things she can say.

Arthur Donald BOUILLE
Arthur Donald BOUILLE
Design student at ENSCI-Les Ateliers
Arthur is the designer of the team: every presentation we make, every thing you’ll ever see about our work, you’ll see it through his eyes, often with his personal black and white esthetic. Coming from a non-scientific field, he taught us a different way of thinking and resolving issues, and defined the application and the scenario about Aether. With his very Parisian style, his beard, his irony and his french accent, he’ll surely conquer you.

Alexis CANTALICE
Alexis CANTALICE
Chemist student at Chimie ParisTech
Nothing is finer than a whole day spent over petri dishes, hands (gloved, of course) immersed in bacterial cultures. He is a pure chemist; experimental manipulations hold no secret for him. A certainly discreet guy, but definitely irreplaceable for the lab work: you can count on him any time!             And then, he will surprise you by throwing an astounding punchline while keeping a perfectly straight face! Beware

My first is a workaholic.              My second is caffeine-addicted.              My third is the barbecue king and mastered the art of preparing a good pastis.              My fourth is sensible and sensitive.               My fifth is a high functioning nerd addicted to our wiki page.              My sixth is an extremely driven guy.              My seventh is a mad chemist.              My all is Gabriel!

Diane GIRARD
Diane GIRARD
Biologist student at the Université Pierre et Marie Curie
Diane is not only an effective and efficient biologist. She has a very particular set of skills, skills she has acquired over a very long career. Skills that are extremely helpfull for people who have back or neck pain. Indeed she is an amazing masseuse. But that's not all. She speaks many languages perfectly, which allows her to blend into all environments and befriend many foreign teams. Finally, her pitching skills allow her to get closer to the most influential people in this field. She is practicaly a "coach" !

Maud GRAINDORGE
Maud GRAINDORGE
Law student at Faculté Jean-Monnet
Maud is a 22 years old law student specialized in intellectual property. She and Azéline are essential to the group as they make sure we             abide by the law in any aspect of our project. She is also a leading member of the group. She and Karima organized many events and meetings.              Besides, Maud is an adorable young little woman with whom you can have both serious and crazy conversations. You will probably see her walking by with Gilson              the bear, our mascot. What a cute couple they make !

Xinzhi GUO
Xinzhi GUO
Engineering student at CentraleSupelec
Tracy is dedicated to seeing things thru. She joined the iGEM Pasteur Paris Team in her Senior year study abroad program from Tutfs university while attending CentraleSupelec near Paris. She brought her insight into the feasibility of the lab aspects of the project based on past experience and knowledge. Very organized, as required if you are away from home, she also added an international facet to the team. A a result, we were compelled to present in English, which slowly made its way up the popularity chart, (Oui, we are in France !!). Always with a smile, always busy !

Paul JEAMMET
Paul JEAMMET
Bio-physic student at Ecole Polytechnique
Paul is a true hipster and quite a surprising guy. He studies Physics and Biology but can chat about philosophy as much as hardtek. He loves his black sunglasses and comics. He is the artist of our team, an amazing musician and a sound engineer. He masters the art of bacteria kinetics (while listening to classical music, please!). His jokes are just too fine to be understood by the average person.

Juliette LANGLAIS
Juliette LANGLAIS
Chemist student at Chimie ParisTech
Juliette is surprising. Shy and often moonstruck, she is a really calm person and a hard-worker. But don't mess with her, she will answer with terrific punchlines ! She is one of the chemists of the team. But not only ! She is also a drama player, a fan-fiction writer and a great sailor. She helped with fundraising using her school network, demonstrating her excel skills. If I had to sum her up in one word I'd say : mysterious.

Nathan RONCERAY
Nathan RONCERAY
Physic student at Ecole Polytechnique
Nathan is a great reflection of our team: he shines trough his transdisplinarity. His studies at Ecole Polytechnique are centered around physics but for our project he did multiple things from labwork to the scenario. His greatest perks are his oral skills: Nathan is an outgoing extrovert and he is a great speaker. Also he is always in a good mood and the life of the party, so if you feel like it don't hesitate to offer to go for a beer afterwork: he'll be up for it!

Pierre-Louis SCHNITZLER
Pierre-Louis SCHNITZLER
Engineering student at CentraleSupelec
Pierre-Louis comes from the eastern region of Alsace. He took full advantage of his semester in Tsinghua to become our team's ambassador to China.
As kind as he is tall, young data scientist, Pierre-Louis leads some of our Human Practices projects, and most of all he is our money man.             Nothing can frighten the great Pierre-Louis, neither the CEOs of major Biotech companies, nor politicians and journalists. Tireless e-mail sender, he is the treasure hunter of the team.

Gaétan VERDIERRE
Bio-chemistry and physics students at ESPCI
Nicknamed the master of cards. Beneath his super engineer looks, Gaétan is a very skilled Magic card player. Those wicked cards with extraordinary powers, allow him to juggle from one field to another, from physics, to biology and chemistry.  All the while in a constant cheerful mood, Gaétan is always full of life. He is part of the inseparable and determined wiki duo with Gabriel. Also an excellent and safe driver with a hilarious sense of humour, Gaétan is the perfect team member and a great friend.
