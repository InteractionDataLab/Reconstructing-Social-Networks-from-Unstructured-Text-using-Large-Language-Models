The dialysis bag should be just submerged in electrophoresis buffer</P><P>    • Electrophorese at ~100v, occasionally monitoring the migration of the DNA under UV-light, until DNA has migrated out of agarose and lines up at the opposite edge of the bag.  Switch polarity of the electrodes and reverse electrophoresis for a minute to elute any dialysis bag-bound DNA.</P><P>    • Transfer the 0.4 ml of buffer containing the DNA to an Eppendorf tube, and rinse bag with 0.1 ml of additional buffer.  Extract once with 0.5 ml phenol and then with 0.5ml CHCl3, and precipitate by adding 50μl of 3M sodium acetate and 1.2 ml of 95% ethanol.</P><P>    • After ~30min at -70°C, microfuge for 15min, rinse pellet with 0.5ml 70% ethanol and dry in Speed-Vac.  Dissolve in 10-20μl of TE0.1 and quantitate by electrophoresing 1-2μl in agarose next to a known STD (1 μg of λ /StyI gives, in ascending size order; bands of 10, 20, 30, 40, 55, 70, 90, 130, 160 and 400 ng of ds DNA).</P><H3>Agarose Gel Preparation</H3><P>    • Add 0.6 grams of 1% agarose to an Erlenmeyer flask (0.9 g for a 1.8% gel).</P><P>    • Fill to 50 mL with 1x TAE</P><P>    • Microwave for 30 second intervals until bubbling, cool slightly</P><P>    • Add 2uL of ethidium bromide and mix</P><P>    • Pour into gel box, avoid air bubbles.</P><P>    • Add comb</P><P>    • Allow to cool</P><H3>Lysis Buffer Protocol</H3><P>    • 50 mmol Sodium Phosphate </P><P>    • 300 mmol Sodium Chloride </P><P>    • 10 mmol Imidazole </P><P>    • Fill to 1L with Milli-Q water </P><P>    • Adjust the pH to 7.5 using HCl</P><H3>Wash Buffer Protocol</H3><P>    • 50 mmol Sodium Phosphate </P><P>    • 300 mmol Sodium Chloride </P><P>    • 25 mmol Imidazole </P><P>    • Fill to 1L with Milli-Q water</P><P>    • Adjust the pH to 7.5 using HCl</P><H3>Elution Buffer Protocol</H3><P>    • 50 mmol Sodium Phosphate</P><P>    • 300 mmol Sodium Chloride</P><P>    • 250 mmol Imidazole </P><P>    • Fill to 1L with Milli-Q water</P><P>    • Adjust the pH to 7.5 using HCl</P><H3>Protein Purification Protocol</H3><P>1.
