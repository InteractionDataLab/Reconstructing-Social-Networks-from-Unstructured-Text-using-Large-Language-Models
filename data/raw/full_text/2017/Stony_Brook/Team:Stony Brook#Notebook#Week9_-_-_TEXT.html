Week 9
7/22:
    • Miniprep of liquid cultures
7/23:
    • Restriction Enzyme Digest of miniprepped plasmids and inserts
    • Ran all digests on gels (1.2% for vectors and 1.8% for inserts)
    • Gel extracted, LnqZE T did not work
    • Made more liquid cultures of MBP, SUMO, LnqZE T, and LnqZE U
7/24:
    • Nanodrop of gel extracts
    • Restriction Enzyme Digest
    • Minipreps of liquid cultures
    • Restriction enzyme digests
    • Ran on gels
7/25:
    • Ran on gels
    • Finally have enough vector and insert to ligate hybrid inserts into vectors
    • Make dilutions of gel extract inserts to perform ligations (Tagged in MBP and Untagged in SUMO)
    • Outreach at Stony Brook Movie Night to educate the community about synthetic biology and iGEM and promote our Chipotle fundraiser!
7/26:
    • Transformation of DH5α E. coli with MBP-LnqZA and MBP- LnqZE tagged hybrids, and untagged LnqZE and LnqZA.
    • Made our lysis, wash, and elution buffers.
    • Made small scale (5 mL)  liquid cultures of  GST lnqZ, GST A53, SUMO Epi, and SUMO LnqZ
    • Chipotle fundraiser from 5-9 pm!
7/27:
    • Made large scale (1 L)  liquid cultures of  GST lnqZ, GST A53, SUMO Epi, and SUMO LnqZ
    • Induced our large scale liquid cultures with IPTG at mid-logarithmic (OD600 around 0.70) growth stage
    • Centrifuged large scale cultures to collect cell pellet. Store at -80°C
    • Made small scale liquid cultures of MBP hybrids
7/28:
    • Presented about iGEM at Stony Brook’s Science and Society Undergraduate College Freshman Orientation
    • Miniprep of MBP hybrids
    • Preparation of miniprepped MBP hybrids and sent for sequencing!
