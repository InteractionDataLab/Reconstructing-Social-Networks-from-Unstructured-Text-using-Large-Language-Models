Week 6
7/03:
    • Nanodrop Results from plasmid miniprep
    • Restriction Enzyme Digest of NEB Constructs
    • Ran digests on 1.2% agarose gels, all failed except MBP
    • PCR of  Aureocin A 53, LnqZ, LnqZ-LnqQ hybrid, and Epidermicin NI01
    • PCR Products run on 1.8% agarose gel
    • PCR Purification of all constructs that ran properly on gel
7/04:
    • Happy Independence Day!
    • Nanodrop Results from PCR Purification
    • Tried to PCR Aureocin A53 again, ran on agarose gel, failed
    • Miniprep of MBP, GST, SUMO liquid cultures
    • Glycerol stocks created of MBP, GST, SUMO cultures- stored in -80°C
    • PCR Purification of Aureocin A53 R1
7/05:
    • Nanodrop Results from PCR Purification: Aureocin A53: 88.5 ng/ul
    • Nanodrop Results from miniprep
    • Restriction Enzyme Digest of vectors and inserts
    • Ran on a gel, everything was successful
    • Gel Extracted Restriction Digest products
    • Nanodrop Results of Gel Extracts
    • PCR Purification Using Enzo and Qiagen Kits
    • Transformed lnqZE and lnqZA tagged and untagged hybrids into DH5α E. coli
7/06:
    • Miniprepped plasmid vectors
    • Nanodrop Results from miniprep
    • Gel Extract of LnqZQ hybrids, Nanodrop Results of Gel Extract
    • Restriction Enzyme Digest of miniprepped vectors, messed up gel, so no results
    • Ligation of inserts with GST and SUMO vectors (20 uL reactions)
                • Set up reactions as shown below
                • Gently pipette up and down and microfuge briefly
                • Incubate at 16°C overnight
    • PCR Purification Using Enzo Kit
    • Made liquid cultures of lnqZE and lnqZA tagged and untagged hybrids
7/07:
    • Transformed and plated single bacteriocin constructs in GST and SUMO vectors
    • Retransformed lnqZE and lnqZA untagged hybrids
    • Nanodrop Results from miniprep
