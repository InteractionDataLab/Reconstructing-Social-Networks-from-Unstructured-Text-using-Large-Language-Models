Week 12
8/14:
    • Continued expression and purification of our proteins.
8/15:
    • Nanodrop of MBP lnqZE Elutions
    • Nanodrop of MBP lnqZA Elutions
    • Nanodrop of MBP lnqZQ Elutions
8/16:
    • Nanodrop of GST A53 Elutions
    • Nanodrop of GST Elutions
    • Nanodrop of MBP lnqZA hybrid Elutions
    • Ran an SDS Page gel to determine whether or not the protein was being synthesized/ where in the purification process it was being collected
                • Tested elutions of GST Epi and MBP lnqZA
8/17:
    • Protein purified MBP lnqZE hybrid, two different samples of MBP lnqZA hybrid, and MBP Lnq ZQ hybrid
8/18:
    • Nandodrop of MBP lnqZE Elutions
    • Nanodrop of sample 1 of MBP lnqZA
    • Nanodrop of sample 2 of MBP lnqZA
