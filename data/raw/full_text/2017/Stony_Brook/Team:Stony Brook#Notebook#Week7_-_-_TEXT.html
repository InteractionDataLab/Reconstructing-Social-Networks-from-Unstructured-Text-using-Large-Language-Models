Week 7
7/08:
    • Made liquid cultures of all of the transformed SUMO and GST ligated plasmids, MBP vector
    • The retransformation of untagged hybrids did not work
7/09:
    • Miniprepped the liquid cultures
    • Nanodrop of minipreps
    • Needed more MBP vector since we had not ligated using MBP vector yet.
7/10:
    • Results of MBP vector miniprep
    •Made LB and Kanamycin Plates (since our vectors have Kan resistance)
    •RE Digest of LnqZA and LnqZE tagged constructs, MBP R1, MBP R2
    • Ran RE Digests of MBP on a 1.2% agarose gel
    • Ran RE Digests of LnqZA tagged and untagged, lnqZE tagged
    • Gel Extract of MBP vectors and inserts that worked
    • Made more liquid cultures of all vectors, hybrid inserts
7/11:
    • Gel Extraction and nanodrop of inserts
    • Miniprep of vectors and hybrid inserts
    • RE Digest of Vectors/Inserts
    • Ran on gel. All samples split into two gel wells (25uL per well).  LnqZA T R1.2 (dropped), MBP 2.1, MBP 3.1, MBP 3.2, LnqZE T and LnqZA U samples did not work.
    • Made Liquid cultures of LnqZA U and LnqZE T
7/12:
    • Gel Extracted all DNA in gels from RE Digests (7/11)
    • Nanodrops Results of Gel Extractions
    • Miniprepped and nanodropped  LnqZA U and LnqZE T
    • Learn about how to prep samples from 7/09 to be sent for sequencing
7/13:
    • Prep samples from 7/09 for sequencing!
                • Each sample needed to be 8 uL in a 20 uL PCR tube to be accepted
                • Each sample must contain 250 ng of DNA
    • More vector liquid cultures of GST, MBP, and SUMO
7/14:
    • Miniprepped and nanodropped GST, MBP, and SUMO
