Our laboratory was certified as a BSL-1 Lab Facility from 5/31, when we moved into lab, until 8/09/2017. During this time, we followed all standard BSL-1 practices.
This included:
    • Wearing closed-toe shoes
    • Wearing long sleeved shirts and pants
    • Wearing Nitrile Gloves
    • Wearing UV protective goggles during gel analysis
    • Appropriate waste disposal procedures for biological waste and liquid waste
All members of the iGEM team completed the following training courses in order start working in the lab:
    • Citi Training: Responsible Conduct of Research in The Biomedical Sciences
    • ELS 002- Lab Safety- Chemical Hazards
    • ELS 003- Laboratory Safety- Safe Handling of Biological Hazards
    • ENV 001- Hazardous Waste
    • ENV 005- Regulated Medical Waste
    • EOS 004 - Blood Borne Pathogens
All surfaces were decontaminated using 70% ethanol before and after handling DH5α E. coli and BL21 E. coli All glassware and pipette tips were sterilized by autoclaving them before use.
In order to test our bacteriocins on Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus, we needed to find a lab space that was BSL-2. BSL-2 laboratory spaces are suitable for working with biological agents that pose a moderate risk to lab personnel. After identifying several lab spaces where we could potentially perform our experiments, we decided it would be best to have our current laboratory space inspected by a Laboratory Safety Specialist from the Department of Environmental Health and Safety.
Our Laboratory was approved to be used as a BSL-2 Lab space because it had the following:
    • A biosafety cabinet with laminar flow
    • An eyewash station
    • Limited access to the laboratory
    • Appropriate BSL-2 signage
    • Usage of sharps containers
Our experiments with MRSA and S. aureus were limited to a three day window in order to limit potential risks and during this time, only 6 members of the iGEM team had access to the laboratory. Any equipment that contained MRSA was kept under lock and key when not in use.
All members performing experiments with MRSA wore:
    • Particulate Respirators
    • Disposable gowns
    • Nitrile gloves
    • Protective eyewear
