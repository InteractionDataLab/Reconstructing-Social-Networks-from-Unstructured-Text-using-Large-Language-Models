Fighting MRSA through hybrid bacteriocins!
Developing hybrid bacteriocins with enhanced bactericidal effects on met­­hicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Each year in the United States, more than 2 million people become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and at least 23,000 people die as a direct result of these infections.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) affects approximately 90,000 Americans each year, with about 20,000 of those cases resulting in death. In response to the shocking fatality of MRSA, it is at the forefront of attention in research on antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.  The global health issues these infections pose, calls for the pursuit of alternative treatments, including the use of bacteriocins as a plausible solution to tackle MRSA.
