Week 11
8/06:
    • Prepared samples of GST A53 and GST LnqZ to run SDS-PAGE
    • Ran SDS-PAGE
    • Viewed SDS-PAGE→ faint protein bands in elution 1 for both A53 and LnqZ, but not in any other elutions
8/07:
    • Nanodropped our elutions of MBP protein purification products
    • Nanodropped our elutions of GST protein purification products
    • Freeze-Thaw of SUMO LnqZ and Epi
    • Made liquid cultures of
                • MBP lnqZE
                • MBP lnqZA
                • MBP lnqZQ
8/08:
    • Nanodrop elutions of SUMO Epi
    • Nanodrop elutions of SUMO Lnq Z
8/09:
    • Continued expression and purification of our proteins.
8/10:
    • Continued expression and purification of our proteins.
    • Discussed improvements on our purification protocol with our advisor Dr. Steven Glynn.
8/11:
    • Continued expression and purification of our proteins.
    • Applied new improvements to our purification protocol, such as the use of a sonicator
