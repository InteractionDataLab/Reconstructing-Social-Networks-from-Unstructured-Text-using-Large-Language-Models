Team Members
Julianna Casella
Julianna is a sophomore majoring in Biology and Psychology and plans to become a pediatrician in the future. She is a member of Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), and involved with Pre-Med Society and Synthetic Biology Cub. In her spare time, she enjoys watching musicals (especially Hamilton!), eating ice cream, and reading. Being the fiery Italian soul she is, she can recite the entire work of Dante’s Inferno in Italian!
Timothy Darby
Timothy is a junior majoring in Biomedical Engineering and aims to pursue a career in medicine/cancer research. Tim is a distinguished member of University Scholars on campus. When he is not chopping up meat at King Kullen or bartending, he enjoys playing volleyball, attempting to sing, hating on Chipotle (despite holding an iGEM fundraiser there), and maintaining his status as someone who has never been on a plane before.
Tabassum Kazi
Tabassum is a junior majoring in Computer Science, and plans to pursue a career as a software developer in the future. On campus, she is a member of Women in Science and Engineering (WISE), and is involved with the Muslim Students Association. In her free time, she enjoys baking and impromptu hangouts...sometimes both together! She loves learning new languages and even taught herself to read/write Korean in an hour!
Fatima Maqsood
Fatima is a junior majoring in Biochemistry, and plans to pursue a career in medicine. On campus, she is a member of University Scholars, Neuroscience Axis, and a writer for Stony Brook Young Investigators Review.
