Gel Electroelution Protocol
Thank you to Dr. Raafat El-Maghrabi for sharing his protocol with us
    • After electrophoresis, cut band of DNA-containing agarose and place in a sterile dialysis bag, clamped on one end.
    • Add 0.4 ml of TE buffer to bag, remove as much air from the bag as possible, move agarose band to one side of the bag, and close with a second clamp (see figure)
    • Place dialysis bag in electrophoresis cell so that the DNA in the agarose is closest to, and facing the elution buffer and the anode.  The dialysis bag should be just submerged in electrophoresis buffer
    • Electrophorese at ~100v, occasionally monitoring the migration of the DNA under UV-light, until DNA has migrated out of agarose and lines up at the opposite edge of the bag.  Switch polarity of the electrodes and reverse electrophoresis for a minute to elute any dialysis bag-bound DNA.
    • Transfer the 0.4 ml of buffer containing the DNA to an Eppendorf tube, and rinse bag with 0.1 ml of additional buffer.  Extract once with 0.5 ml phenol and then with 0.5ml CHCl3, and precipitate by adding 50μl of 3M sodium acetate and 1.2 ml of 95% ethanol.
    • After ~30min at -70°C, microfuge for 15min, rinse pellet with 0.5ml 70% ethanol and dry in Speed-Vac.  Dissolve in 10-20μl of TE0.1 and quantitate by electrophoresing 1-2μl in agarose next to a known STD (1 μg of λ /StyI gives, in ascending size order; bands of 10, 20, 30, 40, 55, 70, 90, 130, 160 and 400 ng of ds DNA).
Agarose Gel Preparation
    • Add 0.6 grams of 1% agarose to an Erlenmeyer flask (0.9 g for a 1.8% gel).
    • Fill to 50 mL with 1x TAE
    • Microwave for 30 second intervals until bubbling, cool slightly
    • Add 2uL of ethidium bromide and mix
    • Pour into gel box, avoid air bubbles.
    • Add comb
    • Allow to cool

4. Let the membrane sit for a half hour to absorb the samples
5.Block the membrane for an hour with a 2% powdered milk-TBS buffer for an hour at room temperature
6.Wash the membrane with TBS buffer to clean the milk solution off and then add a 1:2000 dilution of Anti-his antibody in TBS buffer and rock at 4°C overnight
7.Add the horseradish peroxidase to the membrane and let sit at room temperature for an hour
8.Wash the membrane with TBS buffer before reading
MRSA Testing:
Our MRSA  and S. aureus testing took place during a 3 day period in order to limit exposure to the bacteria in the laboratory and minimize risk.
Rehydration of freeze-dried bacteria from ATCC under laminar flow hood:
    • Heat the tip of the glass outer vial using a Bunsen burner
    • Crack the glass of the outer vial by squirting water on it
    • Strike with a file to remove the outer vial glass
    • Raise cotton plug with forceps and rehydrate the bacteria
    • Dispose of all broken glass and packing materials in a designated sharps container
Tuesday August 24th
    • Biosafety Level Two Restriction was placed on the laboratory space
    • Small liquid cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were made so that enough bacteria was present for the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) Assay and the Spot on Lawn Assay
    • 2 Mueller Hinton Plates were then coated with the Staph. aureus and 2 Mueller Hinton plates were coated with MRSA to prepare for the Spot on Lawn Assay
Wednesday August 25th
    • 13 small liquid cultures were prepared of Staph aureus and 13 more were created for MRSA.
    • Each liquid culture had 50 μL of a bacteriocin or fusion bacteriocin added to the tube according to the following chart. 13 was left as a negative control in both groups
    • For the Spot on Lawn assay, the plates were divided into 6 parts and each part had a small sterile paper circle with the bacteriocin or fusion bacteriocin placed in it. The placement of bacteriocins was similar to that of the MIC assay (1-12)
Thursday August 26th
    • The plates and the cultures were analyzed and no change was observed in terms of growth for the MIC assay and no zone of inhibition was observed for the spot on lawn assay.
    • All MRSA and Staph. aureus was transferred to a flask, covered, placed in an autoclave bag, and killed through autoclaving.
    • The laboratory was disinfected using several cleaning agents and antimicrobial agents to ensure that the area was free of any possible dangerous microbes. The hood, after being thoroughly disinfected, was left with the UV light on for 30 minutes to kill anything remaining in it.
    • All disposable materials used in the assays were disposed of properly (Masks, gowns, tips, etc.)
    • The lab was stripped of its BSL 2 status and returned to its regular BSL1 status.
