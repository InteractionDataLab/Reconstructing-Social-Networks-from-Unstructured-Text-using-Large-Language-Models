Week 10
7/31:
    • Ligation of tagged hybrids with GST and SUMO vectors
    • Transformation of GST tagged and SUMO tagged hybrids into DH5α E. coli
8/01:
    • Made small scale liquid cultures of GST tagged hybrids
    • SUMO hybrids → transformation failed
    • Wanted to start protein purification, but our columns and Ni-NTA resin had not arrived yet.
    • Samples sequenced properly!
8/02:
    • Transformation of MBP LnqZQ, MBP LnqZA and MBP LnqZE into BL21 E. coli
    • Miniprep of GST tagged small scale liquid cultures
    • Nanodrop of minipreps
8/03:
    • Columns and Ni-NTA resin arrived so we can start protein purification!
    • Freeze-thaw cycles 1& 2 on the frozen cell pellets (GST LnqZ, GST A53, GST Epi)
    • Small scale liquid cultures of MBP LnqZA, MBP LnqZE, and MBP LnqZQ
8/04:
    • Finished the last freeze-thaw cycle for GST individual cell pellets
    •  Started the protein purification process by equilibrating columns and nickel resin with lysis buffer
    • Followed all steps outlined for protein purification under the “Experiments and Protocols” tab.
    • Large scale liquid cultures of MBP LnqZA, MBP LnqZE, and MBP LnqZQ, induced with IPTG
    • Centrifuged large scale MBP liquid cultures, collected cell pellets
8/05:
    • Nanodropped our elutions of GST protein purification products
    • Since we did not get good results (most likely no protein), we did not nanodrop our elutions for GST Epi.
    • Decided to run a gel in order to determine whether any protein was being purified even though nanodrop did not yield results
