iGEM quote
How is the wiki going?
Why Are You on iGEM?
Synthetic Biology became my passion on iGEM 2016. Hard-working to achieve your own goals is an amazing experience so I’m participating again to know Plant SynBio deeply along with having an incredible summer.
Hobbies
Do you mean outside of iGEM?  I can't remember anymore. The pipettes and plants are my life right now.

iGEM quote
"This works this way"
Why Are You on iGEM?
I accepted to join iGEM because i was afraid to work in a big project like this, so the way to lose this fear is shock therapy. Another reason is that i like meet new people, and see differents points of view, and biology and this oportunity got together all of this.
Hobbies
I love board games, but I also like playing video games and take walks while talking with friends.

iGEM quote
"I'm not ashamed from hiding it"
Why Are You on iGEM?
When I first meet iGEM i felt curious about it: Hard working, learning a lot of new things and making new friends. "This should be great!" I thought.
Hobbies
A good story will catch me until is finished: Books, games, films, series... When I'm not in the lab, you'll probably find me behind a computer, (e-)book or mobile, reading or searching for whatever i was curious 5 seconds ago.
