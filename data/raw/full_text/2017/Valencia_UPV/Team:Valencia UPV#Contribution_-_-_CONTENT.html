Since the serine recombinase PhiC31 (BBa_K1742004) is codon-optimized for Nicotiana benthamiana, it has been characterized under weak and strong plant-specific promotors (Pnos and p35 respectively).</P><P class="jopesangria">To date, different synthetic and <STRONG class="jopenegrita">bistable genetic toggle switch</STRONG> have been designed with the ability to flip between stable states. Our team chose the recombinase PhiC31 due to its the ability of performing a site-specific recombination between two attachment sites.

The final Optical Density of reporter constructs (Figure 2a and Figure 2c) was 0,02 and the optical density of PhiC31 construct (Figure 2b) was 0,01.

After 48h, all leaves were also sampled. Overall, two points of samples were taken in the assay.</P><P class="jopesangria">After analyzing the data obtained from luciferase assay, it can be observed at Figure 2:</P><OL class="jopeli"><LI>A significantly difference between the OFF and the ON state expression levels.</LI><LI>The recombinase expression under a weak promoter (pNOS promoter) shows the same luciferase expression that the constitutive positive control (genetic construct which is expressing constitutively luciferase protein under the strong promoter).</LI><LI>However, the recombinase expression under the strong promoter shows the same expression level of the constitutive weak control (genetic construct based on the constitutive expression of luciferase under a pNOS weak promoter)</LI></OL><P class="jopesangria">The likelihood of producing the inversion event should be directly proportional to the luciferase protein concentration inside plant cell. Consequently, more quantity of phiC31 recombinase entails more probability of activating reporter gene expression. However, this experiment shows that once recombinase expression exceeds a certain <STRONG class="jopenegrita">threshold</STRONG>, the effect changes so the likelihood of up-regulating the reporter gene <STRONG class="jopenegrita">expression decreases</STRONG>.</P><P class="jopesangria">In order to provide robust evidences to the hypothesis explained above, a subsequent experiment (https://2017.igem.org/Team:Valencia_UPV/Experiments#Phic31Per) was performed. In this case, PhiC31 behavior was analyzed while being regulated by a weak promoter (pNOS) together with an optical density (A.tumefaciens culture concentration) 10-fold higher than the used in aforementioned experiment (Figure 3).</P><P class="jopesangria">Figure 3. a) Graphic representation of the construct comprised by a promoter and a terminator in opposite directions flanked by ΦC31 attachment sites (attB and attP).

Although the expected hypothesis may be that the more recombinase concentration the more inversion events, the obtained results suggest the existence of a threshold above which that assumption is not true. Therefore, <STRONG class="jopenegrita">a low recombinase expression is needed</STRONG> in order to maximize recombinase action.</P><P class="jopesangria">Our team has improved the characterization of the Phytobricks (PhiC31) documenting our experimental design and the results that were obtained.
