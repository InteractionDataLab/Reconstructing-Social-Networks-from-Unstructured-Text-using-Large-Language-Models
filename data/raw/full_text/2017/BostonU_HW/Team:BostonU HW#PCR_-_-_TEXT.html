Summary
PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, is a commonly used protocol in synthetic biology in order to replicate target DNA fragments. Through the use of specific primers, polymerases, and temperature cycling, exponential replicas of the target DNA fragment can be made. These fragments can then be ligated into plasmids and transformed into bacteria.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform PCR. A solution containing the required substrates for PCR is flowed into the chip and through a mixer, on top of chip a heating element will be placed. The valves at both ends of the mixer are closed, isolating the mixture, and then the heating element performs temperature cycling. The liquid is then pushed out into an output receptacle for future use in the lab.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.
