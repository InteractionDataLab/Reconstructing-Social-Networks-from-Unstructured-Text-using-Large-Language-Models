May
The BU Wetlab and Hardware iGEM teams participated in joint Wetlab safety and protocol training
The team performed an initial literature review in order to learn more about the types of microfluidic devices being design
The team was given a software overview/explanation of the three CIDAR lab microfluidic design tools: 3Duf, Fluigi, and Neptune
The team was given an overview/explanation of the CIDAR lab microfluidic design manufacturing process: Makerfluidics
June
