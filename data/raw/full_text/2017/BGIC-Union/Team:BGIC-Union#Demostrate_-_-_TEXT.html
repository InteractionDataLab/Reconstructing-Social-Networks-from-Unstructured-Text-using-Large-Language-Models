Product design
After discussing our project with researcher from Peking university Hospital in Shenzhen, we realized that the amount of ct DNA is very low in blood. So we designed our project with different kinds of amplification methods to increase the amount.  T7 dCas9 system has an important role in our design. It can amplify signals and can express into different output. It can also use inside human’s body or as a detective switch. We also include NASBA to increase the amplification of our signal.
Safe
Our product adopts cell-free system for our test paper to prevent the patient from interacting with virus cell directly. Also, we provide a test tube for patients to collect their blood. They only need one drop of blood using a clean needle.
Simple
The test paper will come with a kit. The kit will include all the materials for detection with a simple protocol, so patients can use it at home by themselves.
Cheap
Once we have a template for our system, we could duplicate the test paper easily. Cell-free system will provide an environment for transcription and translation to happen. So we can lower the cost of one test paper when we have enough copies.
