BGIC_Union iGEM team 2017 is a steady, sympathetic and honorable group of twelve passionate young Chinese students studying in different countries in the world. We worked together for the past several months with the guidance and support provided by our instructors, Mr. Wang Boxiang and Ms.Zhang.

                                     My name is Peter and I’m from Shanghai. I’m the student leader in my team and this is not an easy work because I need to make sure the whole team are striving for the same goal step by step. So my work covered from every part of our project to all kinds of mission assign. Thanks for the chance that my other team member gave me, now I do better on how to be a leader.

     Hello everyone, I am Honghao Su from Shandong Experimental High School. I am a senior 3 student and I am going to major in genetics and molecular biology in college. In the team, my main responsibilities are designing the project, carrying out protein experiments, modeling, and searching for collaborations. Participating in the iGEM project in team BGIC-Union, I have experienced the process of a true scientific research project and I have found the great potentials of synthetic biology in various applications.

     Hi there, I am Sammy from Morton Hall School, UK. As the leader of public promotion, my role included holding human practice events and designing promotional materials. After handing in countless drafts of poster, now I understand the pain and struggle to be a designer lead. It is my honor to work with my teammates and I cannot imagine how plain this year could be without BGIC-Union.

     Hi,I am Xiao and you can also call me Lucy~ The last year for IGEM is a year of trying everything.From a green hand in molecular cloning and protein purification to a so-called sophisticated lab assistant with countless “dark past”, I learned one thing from it: the more careful you are, the better your experiments’ results you will get. Meeting so many interesting team members here really impress me well.And IGEM let me get to know what the path towards biology look like.It’s just like the running of Haruki murakami, only constant effort brings success.
I help with the experiments in molecular cloning and protein purification and participate in some parts of Human Practice.
