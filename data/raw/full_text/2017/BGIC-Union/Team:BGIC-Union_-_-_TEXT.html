dCasentry
a dCas9-T7coupled DNA sensor
Hi, I am dCasentry,
dCasentry: A guardian against Lung Cancer Lung cancer is one of the deadliest malignant tumors in the world, with highest death rate in China. The most widely used lung cancer detection method nowadays remains biopsy, which may cause pain infection and bruising. However, the technic of liquid biopsy obviates this problem by detecting various factors including circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA is a short strand of DNA released from tumor cells that can be deemed as the sign of cancer. Although traditional liquid biopsy avoids many side effects, it requires laboratory apparatus such as PCR instrument during detection. Also, some other ctDNA detection systems fail to overcome the difficulty of the extremely low concentration of ctDNA in the blood. To solve those problems, we developed a new liquid biopsy method using dCas9 protein with a much simple procedure while increase the signal with various kinds of output. We hope to adopt free-dried paper chip as our vector of detecting system to simplify its operation as well as storage. Finally, the product will be presented as a kit that contains all the items you needed for convenient machine-free detection. Please, click here and know more about me as well as the product!
