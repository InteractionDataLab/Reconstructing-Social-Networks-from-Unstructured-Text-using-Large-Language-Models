					We produced a product portfolio to analyze whether our product fit the market. The product portfolio includes a general market analysis and a specific health check market analysis in China, a full product description and a SWOT analysis of our product. We concluded that health check is suitable market to assess due to the large scale of customers every year, but improvement must be made to satisfy vary demand in cancer detection. On the other hand, large scale of promotion and education should be made in advance to prevent misunderstanding from public.
					
					We applied our designed system on the a screening chip. The DNA device and proteins that required for detection can mix with E.coli cell-free system, freeze-dried on a paper chip, and stored in low temperature. The blood sample from the patient provides a liquid environment which can reactivate the cell-free system. The reaction takes place when the target sequence presents, emitting fluorescence on screening chip. Individuals can use the product associate with a kit to detect lung cancer within few hours. A further analysis of the market is also made in the section of entrepreneurship.

					We compeled a survey and analysis for Chinese companies who provide ctDNA detection and cancer screening services. The companies all provide similar detecting services but with slightly varied outcome. However, no similar technique is used in those companies indicates there is no technology monopoly in this industry at the moment. We analyzed the result of this investigation in order to put our product in social content and compare it with others exist products in the market. 
We also communicate with experts to give their opinions on our product design. For example, we visited Dr Fang from Peking University shenzhen hospital and member of staff from BGI product research department. All suggestions and opinions that we gathered help us improve the efficiency and customers experience of our product.
					<STRONG>On Engagement...</STRONG>
					We gave small science lectures to enrich STEM education in primary school and middle school as well as a formal introduction of the iGEM competition in one of the largest high school in Shenzhen to establish a new iGEM team. We distributed questionaires afterwards to make sure they comprehended the talks. 
On a larger stage, we participated in the 12th Annual Meeting of the International Conference on Genomics and talked about our iGEM experience.
We wrote about our project and documented the progress on several project incubator platforms and receive monetary support for more than 3, 000 USD in total. We also raised questions on the significance of participating in iGEM for high school students on Zhihu (Chinese Quora). We documented our experience in a column we created under BGI College Makerspace 's official account on (Chinese largest social platform）Wechat with over 3,500 subscribers of the account.
