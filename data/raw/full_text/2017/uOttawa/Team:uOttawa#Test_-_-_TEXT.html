Construction of Gene Regulatory Networks using Synthetic Guide RNAs.
Introduction
The engineering of genetic networks often relies on transcriptional regulatory modules composed of a promoter and the transcription factor proteins that modulate the activity of that promoter. In this approach, the properties of a network are determined by the way modules are “wired” together, and one can enable new functionalities by changing the wiring of the network without introducing new parts.
A key feature of many transcription factor proteins is that they bind DNA sequence elements with high specificity. This has some obvious advantages but also means that the regulation is “hard-wired”. With conventional transcriptional regulatory modules, it is not possible to redirect a transcription factor protein to a different promoter without changing the DNA sequence of that promoter.
The principle of regulated recruitment offers an interesting alternative to the conventional use of transcription factor proteins in genetic network engineering. In this principle, the transcription factor proteins don’t bind to DNA directly. Instead, they are recruited to a promoter by a second factor, an adaptor, which is capable of recognizing certain DNA sequences within the promoter. This makes possible to redirect a transcription factor protein to a different promoter by without changing the DNA sequence of that promoter.
Our project will explore if regulated recruitment using synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) is a viable alternative to conventional transcriptional regulatory modules in genetic network engineering. These regulatory RNAs can modulate gene transcription by facilitating the recruitment of certain engineered transcription factors, and it should in principle be possible to create gene regulatory networks in which sgRNAs are used to regulate the expression of other sgRNAs molecules and the expression conventional transcription factor proteins. While sgRNAs networks have been built in the past, the ones we propose to create include feedback loops that enable more complex functionalities. To our knowledge, sgRNA feedback control has not been studied much in the past.
To explore the potential of sgRNAs in genetic network engineering, we will implement sgRNA-based versions of two different system, the Linearizer and the Genetic Toggle Switch,  in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Linearizer network was originally build …add details… The second network we will construct, the Genetic Toggle Switch, was originally build in Escherichia coli and consists of two proteins that repress expression of one another in such a way that they are mutually exclusive. When the expression of one protein is ON, the expression of the other protein will be turned OFF. Because of this, one can flip the switch from one phenotype or another (e.g., from OFF/ON to ON/OFF) by inactivating the dominant repressor. Remarkably, the switch functions as non-genetic heredity because the phenotypic state of the switch is transferred from one generation to the next.
The suitability of sgRNAs in genetic network engineering depends critically on the availability of suitable promoters. The expression of sgRNAs is usually driven by so-called Pol III promoters, which function in ways that are very different from the Pol II promoters used to control the expression of protein-encoding genes. We simply don’t know if Pol III promoters will allow an sgDNA-based Genetic Toggle Switch to work. From mathematical modelling, we know that the two promoters in the network must have low basal activity or “leakiness”, high maximal expression rate, a switch-like response changing inputs, and low gene expression noise. Fortunately, a study published in May 2017 by Gander et al., suggests that it is possible to express functional sgRNA from PolII promoters in yeast and that sgRNAs and be used to control the expression of other sgRNA.
