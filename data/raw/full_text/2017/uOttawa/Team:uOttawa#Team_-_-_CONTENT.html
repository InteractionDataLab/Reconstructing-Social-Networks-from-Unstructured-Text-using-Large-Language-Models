It’s Yuchen here, just a friendly 3rd year biomed student at uOttawa. This is the first iGEM experience for many of us, including of myself. It wasn't easy, and sometimes even stressful, but in this process, we learned, had fun, and as a team we have accomplished so much! I am proud to be part of this group of enthusiastic synthetic biologists. It has been a pleasure! El Psy Congroo. </P></DIV><DIV id="profile-bio" class="pure-u-1 pure-u-sm-15-24"><H2>Sakib Kazi</H2><P>I’m currently a 3rd year undergraduate thrill seeker.

Being a complete rookie in the field of molecular biology, she has devoted her entire summer and even school time to learn the basic techniques while developing and and executing wet lab experiments.

While my work focuses on tissue engineering, I’ve developed a particular interest in science policy and regulation. What goes on behind the scenes has a huge impact on the work scientists are able to and in turn how our work is able to help people. The Human Policies and Practices team looks at just that, and how scientific research is ultimately translated and applied. I also volunteer for Actions for Healthcare, a group promoting interest in healthcare research and jobs through events and mentor ship events. Aside from those I love food and making art!</P></DIV><DIV id="profile-bio" class="pure-u-1 pure-u-sm-15-24"><H2>Gerry Huynh</H2><P>Hey everyone! I am involved in the Human Practices of the uOttawa iGEM team. I decided to join the team because I believe that the public's opinion on research should be as important as the impact of research on the public. I am interested in spreading awareness and collecting the public's input on what we do for research in iGEM.</P></DIV><DIV id="profile-bio" class="pure-u-1 pure-u-sm-15-24"><H2>Sarah Margeret Ziegel</H2><P>Sarah is enjoying the final year of her biochemistry degree and post graduation she intends to pursue dental school.
