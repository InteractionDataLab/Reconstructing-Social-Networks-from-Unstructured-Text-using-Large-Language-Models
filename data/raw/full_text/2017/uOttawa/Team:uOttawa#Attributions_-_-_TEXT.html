Wet Lab
The wet lab team consisted of Yuchen Luo, Sakib Kazi, Setti Belhouri, and Jaycie Dalson. All members helped design and build our DNA constructs. Yuchen Luo, Sakib Kazi, and Setti Belhouri were responsible for collecting data by flow cytometry with assistance from Kateland Marie, and creating biobricks.
This years project was a new initiative undertaken by a group of students participating in iGEM for the first time. We were inspired to do our work based on the findings of Gander, Miles W., et al. “Digital logic circuits in yeast with CRISPR-dCas9 NOR gates.” Nature Communications, vol. 8, 2017, p. 15459., doi:10.1038/ncomms15459. The authors were incredibly supportive of our project and we thank them for their advice. We'd like to thank all of the grad students: Kateland Marie and Danny Salem for their infinite wisdom and support.
Lastly, we'd like to recognize our supervisor, Mads Kaern, who generously provides lab space and the resources we need to participate in iGEM year after year, and we would like to thank Brendan Camellato.
Dry Lab
Shoumak Bhattacharya and Peter Doan helped the 2017 uOttawa team with mathematical models.
The wiki was designed and written by Peter Doan.
