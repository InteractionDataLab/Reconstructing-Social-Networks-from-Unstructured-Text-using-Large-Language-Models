Letâ€™s Talk Science
In an effort to extend our reach into our university and city communities, the University of Ottawa iGEM Human Practices Team partnered up with Let's Talk Science for the 2017 season. Let's Talk Science is an award-winning, national organization that creates and delivers programs to engage youth and educators in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). As a team, we recognized that our interests as Policy and Practices overlapped with the interests of Let's Talk Science in educating youth about the possibilities that science, including the field of synthetic biology, brings. We established communication with the Ottawa Chapter of Let's Talk Science and a great partnership was established for the 2017 season.
Adventures in Science
We also had a wonderful opportunity to work with Adventures in Science, a camp run in Ottawa that teaches science to youth during the summer in fun and engaging experiments. We spoke to campers about iGEM and the wonders of genetic engineering, and performed age appropriate synthetic biology activities to spark interest.
SynBio Science Research Workshop
During the 2017 year at the University of Ottawa, we organized a Research Skills Workshop. We spoke undergraduates about the various research opportunities available to them and how to get involved, particularly in synthetic biology. The event also consisted of an opportunity to ask questions to current grad students, and hands on experience in a synthetic biology wet lab
Investigating Opinion of Genetic Engineering
In order to gain an understanding of current thoughts on genetic engineering, an investigation, through interviews and surveys, targeting a wide range of career and education levels was conducted and the results are discussed in this report.
The results of the investiation will allow for improved responsiveness to the community with regards to human practice and educational outreach.
