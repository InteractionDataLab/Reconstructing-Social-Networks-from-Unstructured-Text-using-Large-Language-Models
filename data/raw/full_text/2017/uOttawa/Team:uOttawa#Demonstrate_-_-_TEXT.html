We tested the potential of the sgrna dcas9 system as an alternative to traditional transcription factors to introduce gene regulation and repression. Our system consisted of a constitutive promoter for yeGFP, a dcas9-mxi1 plasmid, and two sgrnas (sgrna1 and sgrna2) transformed into a suitable yeast chassis. The sgrnas are designed to hybridize with specific regions of complementarity on the yeGFP promoter. All elements were successfully incorporated to complete the system.
Figure 4 Results measured by flow cytometry indicating expression of GFP for w303 yeast containing the dcas9 sgrna1 system shown in red. Compared to the negative control of the w303 yeast expressing baseline levels of yeGFP with dcas9 in absence of sgrna1.
The results shown in figure 4 compare the relative GFP expression in w303 S. Cerevisiae between a complete sgRNA dcas9 system including the sgrna1 (red) versus the negative control without sgRNA1 (green). The results show a decreased  population count of GFP colonies as measured by flow cytometry, indicating a successful repression by the sgRNA dcas9 system.
As a new team with minimal training and time constraints, there are further questions and data collection that we would have liked to explore and incorporate in our project. However, based on the results collected, we were able to demonstrate that sgRNA dcas9 system exhibit the potential as an alternative to traditional transcription factors in gene regulatory networks. In future works, we would like to explore the possibility of applying this mechanism to a toggle switch or increasingly complex gene networks.
