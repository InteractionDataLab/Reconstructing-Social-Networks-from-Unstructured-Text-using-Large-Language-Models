Wetlab
Yuchen Luo
Hello world! It’s Yuchen here, just a friendly 3rd year biomed student at uOttawa. This is the first iGEM experience for many of us, including of myself. It wasn't easy, and sometimes even stressful, but in this process, we learned, had fun, and as a team we have accomplished so much! I am proud to be part of this group of enthusiastic synthetic biologists. It has been a pleasure! El Psy Congroo.
Sakib Kazi
I’m currently a 3rd year undergraduate thrill seeker. Genetic engineering is my definition of thrill seeking.
Setti Belhouri
Setti Belhouari takes competition to another level.  Being a complete rookie in the field of molecular biology, she has devoted her entire summer and even school time to learn the basic techniques while developing and and executing wet lab experiments. She is currently completing an Honours in Biochemistry and minor in mathematics.
Jaycie Dalson
My name is Jaycie Dalson. I am a 19 yr old student in my second year of Biomedical Science at the University of Ottawa. I joined iGEM this year to learn valuable lab experience while exploring the field of synthetic biology.
Drylab
Peter Doan
4th year student studying Mechanical Engineering and Computing Technology at the University of Ottawa. Been a part of 2013, 2014, and now 2017 uOttawa iGem team. Am always seeking to apply engineering technologies into differing and interesting fields.

The one who has many answers, but many more questions...
Human Practice
Raeesa Matadar
I’m Raeesa and I’m an MASc student in biomedical engineering. While my work focuses on tissue engineering, I’ve developed a particular interest in science policy and regulation. What goes on behind the scenes has a huge impact on the work scientists are able to and in turn how our work is able to help people. The Human Policies and Practices team looks at just that, and how scientific research is ultimately translated and applied. I also volunteer for Actions for Healthcare, a group promoting interest in healthcare research and jobs through events and mentor ship events. Aside from those I love food and making art!
Gerry Huynh
Hey everyone! I am involved in the Human Practices of the uOttawa iGEM team. I decided to join the team because I believe that the public's opinion on research should be as important as the impact of research on the public. I am interested in spreading awareness and collecting the public's input on what we do for research in iGEM.
Sarah Margeret Ziegel
Sarah is enjoying the final year of her biochemistry degree and post graduation she intends to pursue dental school. As member of the Sci-X and Simple Bio clubs Sarah enjoys promoting science-related out reach programs on the University of Ottawa campus.
Masters
Kateland Marie
I'm a graduate student from Texas completing my M.Sc. in cellular and molecular medicine and specializing in bioinformatics in the Kaern Lab. I love synthetic biology and iGEM is a great way for me to introduce new students to this world!
