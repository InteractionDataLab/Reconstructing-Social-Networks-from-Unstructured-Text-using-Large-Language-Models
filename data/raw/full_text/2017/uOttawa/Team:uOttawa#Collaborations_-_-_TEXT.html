Ontario iGEM (oGEM)
Seven iGEM teams from Ontario (uOttawa, McMaster , Toronto , Queen's , Western, Guelph , and Waterloo ) continued an initiative to create a larger Canadian presence in synthetic biology and iGEM. This initiative, Ontario iGEM (or oGEM), helps each team to solidify their projects throughout the summer. oGEM also has crucial connections with all of its affiliated universities, industry, and the Ontario Genomics Institute, which helps with finding resources to fund each team. Through oGEM we were able to give and receive assistance with regards to the design of our sgRNA networks from other senior teams. Furthermore, we collaborated with the University of Toronto by participating in their synthetic biology podcast.
Canadian iGEM Newsletter
We collaborated along iGEM teams across Canada in an initiative led by iGEM Calgary to create a Canadian iGEM Newsletter. This newsletter allows various iGEM teams to stay connected with what their fellow teams in Canada are up to, fostering a national synbio community while increasing public awareness.
Survey Collaboration with Nebraska
Nebraska completed a survey we designed to gather information on gauge public knowledge about what genetic engineering and opinions regarding the importance of genetic engineering research. We reciprocally participated in a survey run by Nebraska. For details, please click the badge.
