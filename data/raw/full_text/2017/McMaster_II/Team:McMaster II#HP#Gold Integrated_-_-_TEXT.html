Human Practices - Gold Criterion
When planning for the The McMaster University Life Sciences Competition, our team established two main objectives: (1) To promote synthetic biology as a viable solution to worldwide problems and (2) To investigate whether general students have concerns regarding implementation of synthetic biology. With regards to the latter point, we found that many teams raised safety concerns in their own presentations, citing considerations that must be made before approval for real-world implementation. We realized that this concern would be shared amongst the general public as well as safety officers, especially as our project involves injection of bacteria directly into humans for therapeutic purposes. To provide assurance to interested parties, our team drafted a position paper exploring safety considerations that must be made when using bacteria-based drug delivery to humans. While this position paper presents a holistic overview of all considerations that need to be made, the relevant points were integrated into our project. Considerations are listed below for three problems: plasmid instability, uncontrolled cell growth, and expansion of our project beyond a proof of concept.
Plasmid Instability
Removal of horizontal gene transfer elements: Horizontal gene transfer can occur through three mechanisms: conjugation, transduction, and transformation [1]. Conjugative plasmid transfer from the bioengineered bacteria to others present in the environment or host can be prevented by ensuring that an origin of transfer is not present in the plasmid backbone. In transduction, DNA is transferred between bacteria via bacteriophages. In human systems, transduction has been shown to mobilize virulence genes, antibiotic genes, and genes related to fitness between probiotic and pathogenic bacteria [2]. This process can often happen randomly, as genes can be taken up by these bacterial viruses as they progress through their life cycle. Transformation, which is the uptake of exogenous DNA, is an additional concern given that our system is expected to downregulate itself by means of cell lysis through Hok-induced membrane depolarization, exposing the plasmids to surrounding bacteria. The best way to prevent this process is through the design of plasmid-free systems, discussed below [3]. Kinetic Model: A transient expression profile for the bacteria system is crucial for predicting its activity when administered to humans.4 Without a clear case-by-case model for plasmid instability and dose release, bioengineered bacteria must be identified as volatile compounds.  For the purposes of our proof-of-concept model, it was important to understand the kinetics of gene expression in response to the two stimuli: hypoxia and low pH. Focusing on pH, our team designed a model that considered the strength of the promoters, allowing for cell growth to be roughly approximated. In future steps, when the system is grown in in vivo models, additional inputs can be added to this rough guide to predict plasmid instability [4]. Hok/sok stabilization: Expression of the plasmids used in the bacteria can place a metabolic burden on E. coli, leading to increased instability over time. The hok/sok system is effective in attenuating this instability [5]. The toxicity of the hok gene can be muted by sok, an anti-sense RNA that is complementary to the hok gene. They are located on two plasmids, with hok placed on a significantly smaller backbone while sok is located with the majority of the other genes. Due to its large size, the plasmid containing sok decays at a much faster rate and can be lost in binary fission. However, the hok gene will always be inherited, and induce apoptosis if the sok gene decays. Therefore, only bacteria with the large plasmid containing sok can survive, ensuring plasmid stability.
Uncontrolled bacterial growth:
Hok/sok kill mechanism: Containment modules can be built into the synthetic system to induce cell death in two scenarios: (1) The therapeutic target is eliminated (2) The bacteria leaves the target therapeutic area in the body. In the system designed for this project, the hok/sok killing mechanism can be activated when either scenario occurs. While the toxic protein Hok is expressed constituitively, it can be repressed via sok antisense RNA, which is downstream of a pH promoter [5]. Therefore, in the presence of a tumour, hok is not activated and cell growth is encouraged. However, when either the bacteria moves away from the tumour or the tumour is eliminated, sok is not expressed and cell death is activated.
Considerations for projects beyond a proof of concept:
The purpose of this project was to develop a proof of concept exploring whether both cytotoxicity and quorum sensing could be induced via detection of stimuli native to tumours. As such, the materials used in this project were specifically chosen to fit that purpose. If this system were to be adapted to be functional in an in vivo setting, many considerations would have to be considered to ensure safety. Genome editing: In order to be used in clinical trials, bacterial strains must be designed without plasmids. While plasmids allow for easy, quick genomic modifications, the possibility of horizontal gene transfer due to their high mobility increases the risk profile of the technique. While the bacteria used in this project were manipulated strictly via transfer of plasmids, this was only done as a proof-of-concept. In a fully-realized system, the bacteria would have the necessary genes inserted into their chromosomes instead. This can be accomplished with genome-editing techniques such as using CRISPR Cas-9 [6]. Bacteria strain: The strain of bacteria used for this project was DH5É‘, an expression strain optimized towards plasmid isolation. Specifically, it lacks recA and endonucleases, which leads to reduced homologous recombination and plasmid digestion respectively [7]. As such, it was an ideal strain to use for this project, in which genes were constantly being isolated. However, for the purposes of drug delivery, commensal bacteria are preferred due to their lack of toxicity towards human cells. One specific strain of E. coli that has been approved for clinical trials is the Nissa strain, a commonly found probiotic [8].
