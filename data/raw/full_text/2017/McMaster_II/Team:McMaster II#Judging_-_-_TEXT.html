Design a new part central to your project
Our new part places cyan fluorescent protein downstream of a hypoxia inducible promoter (BBa_K387003). This is an important reporter system for this promoter, and was critical to our project in order to determine the specificity of our circuit to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment. This is critical to the development of an effective bacterial cancer therapy. For more information on the part click here . For information on the experimental characterization of the part, please click here . This hypoxia-RBS-CFU was a critical reporter which we designed for our circuit.
Collaboration
We collaborated with the Oxford iGEM Team to develop a simulation for their project using the supercomputer cluster at McMaster University. This assisted them by furthering their knowledge of protein conformation and the stability of systems central to their project. The Oxford iGEM Team helped us to advance our project by sharing code with us to help us supplement our pre-existing model of the complex feedback loops and protein expression involved in our project.

Human Practices
We worked with elementary school students in Hamilton to develop a project for a local science fair. We provided the students with materials, met with them on a weekly basis, and offered advice in order to help them succeed at the science fair and to foster their interest in science. For a more detailed explanation on our human practices, please see our practices page by clicking here .

Create a model for your project.
We used reaction kinetics to model the transcription of the pH-dependent promoter and used molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the acyl homo-L-serine (AHL) synthase. For the first time, we identified the binding site of the AHL synthase enzyme using these biophysical modelling techniques.Please see our modelling page for a better explanation by clicking here .
