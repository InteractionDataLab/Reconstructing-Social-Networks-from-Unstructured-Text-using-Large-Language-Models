                We chose to improve the characterization of the hypoxia-inducible promoter (BBa_K387003). This promoter was designed by SJTU-BioX-Shanghai in 2010 to serve as their detector for low oxygen levels. However, they did not fully characterize the part. The team only measured the activity of the fdhF promoter under two conditions: normal oxygen pressure (20%) and hypoxic oxygen pressure (&lt; 20%). Therefore, we decided to improve this characterization by showing the activity of the fdhF promoter under varying oxygen pressures.
            
                To simulate hypoxic conditions were implemented the following method. We took up 200 uL of a sixteen-hour overnight culture into a syringe. In order to place the culture under different oxygen concentrations, we added different amounts of air into the syringe by drawing the stopper up. We chose the following air volumes (in uL) to characterize the promoter activity: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300. After creating the varying hypoxic conditions, the syringes were dipped into agar and allowed to solidify. This created a seal that did not allow any oxygen to enter. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. The syringes were incubated for 24 hours. Triplicates of each syringe was prepared in a 96-well plate and the fluorescence was read in a plate reader.

                     Through this experiment set-up, we were able to improve the characterization of the fdhF promoter (BBa_K387003). We were able to measure the promoter activity under varying concentrations of oxygen and obtain the data in Figure 2.

                    Our data shows that the hypoxia-inducible promoter is maximally activated when there is no air present in the syringe. Moreover, the activity of the promoter showed an inverse relationship to the volume of the air in the syringe. As the air volume increased, the fluorescence measured decreased.
                    In conclusion, we improved the characterization of the hypoxia-inducible fdhF promoter (BBa_K387003) by measuring its activity under varying concentrations of oxygen. Our results indicate that the promoter is maximally activated when there is no oxygen present and it shows a decreased activity as the concentration increases.

The bacteria exposed to hypoxic conditions produce cyan fluorescent proteins.</P></DIV><P> The characterization of the hypoxia promoter fused with CFP was critical to our project because our project involves the tumour microenvironment which has been characterized to be hypoxic. Moreover, we tested the part under various hypoxic conditions to ensure that the promoter is a reliable detector for tumours, which have been shown to have fluctuating hypoxic states. Previous characterizations were done under a single hypoxic state. Therefore, this part and its characterization served a critical role in our project. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
