Achievements
Designed a genetic circuit that harnesses the principle of bacterial colony quorum sensing to:.
localize a potent chemotherapeutic agent to two unique features of the tumour microenvironment, hypoxia and low pH; and
invoke a ‘kill switch’ that causes bacterial growth, and consequent production of the gene-delivered agent, to become self-limiting
Provided insights into the activity of our chemotherapeutic synthase using molecular dynamics
Created a mathematical model to characterize the kinetics of the multiple steps in transcriptional regulation governing our gene circuit
We added 8 new BioBrick parts to the iGEM registry. Read here for details!
We mentored three teams of elementary school students to complete award-winning projects on at the 2017 Bay Area Science and Engineering Fair, and involved more than thirty undergraduate students in a case competition which taught the principles of synthetic biology using the Inquiry model of group learning.
