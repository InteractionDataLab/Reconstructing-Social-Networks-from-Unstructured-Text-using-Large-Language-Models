Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Scheme
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations offer unprecedented detail into the underpinnings of protein-protein interaction. For any dimer, there is a specific sequence of contact residues on each dimer that correspond to the dimerization and subsequent signalling. We developed a production scheme for use in the GROMACS MD package to test site-directed mutagenesis in silico. Specifically, one would input the specific sequence of interest (DDV) and the PDB of the dimer. The program would run simulations of the system in a membrane package for the initial dimer and mutagenized dimers.                  The simulation scheme is provided below. The residues to be substituted would be removed, and a harmonic potential would be applied to the residues nearby to away from the removed residue. After this, a new residue would be added to the alpha-carbon and the system would re-equilibrated and re-ran. The system outputs typical results from the MD simulation.
For example, with the AHL synthase enzyme, we could substitute the binding site near residues 108-141 and find that with the greatest reduced root mean-square fluctuations and use this to direct our gene sequence in vitro. Doing this, we may be able to make quorum sensing more sensitive in E. coli. References:                 [1] Abraham MJ, Murtola T, Schulz R, PÃ¡ll S, Smith JC, Hess B, Lindahl E.
