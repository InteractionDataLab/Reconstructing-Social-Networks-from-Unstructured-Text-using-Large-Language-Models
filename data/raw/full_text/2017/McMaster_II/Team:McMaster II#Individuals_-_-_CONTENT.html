            This project would not be possible without the help of many individuals and groups. We would like to sincerely thank everyone that has been involved with our project since its inception, leading to its eventual completion. Throughout each step of the process, we have been fortunate to have some of the most amazing support networks both at our University and in our surrounding community.

            An extra thank you is extended to the following individuals:

                Dr. Rheinstadter has been central to the oversight of our project and computer modelling. His advice on both research and personal matters has helped make our project feasible and tangible, and his approach towards scienctific research has inspired many tangential aspects of our project.
