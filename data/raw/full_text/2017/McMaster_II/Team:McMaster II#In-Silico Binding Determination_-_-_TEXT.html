MD Simulations
Using the GROMOS 54a7 force-field with the GROMACS MD package on MacSim, a GPU-accelerated workstation in the Origins of Life Lab at McMaster University, we were able to run replicate all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The acyl homo-L-serine synthase enzyme was taken from the PDB database (1R05) and fit in a rectangular box with ~12000 water molecules with a periodic boundary condition applied in all directions. The systems were energy minimized, and equilibrated with the NVT/NPT ensemble prior to running 20 production simulations of 5 ns each. For systems with the SAM ligand to the AHL synthase, umbrella sampling was used to find itâ€™s most preferred state in the bilayer. Then the molecule was placed, using VMD, in the water layers surrounding the protein Monte-Carlo. 20 production simulations for 10 ns were run.
The first term is a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, which approximates the typical interaction between pairs of neutral atoms and molecules. The second term is based on Coulomb's law and holds the electrostatics between. The last term holds the dihedrals of angle restraints. To define further the interactions between these atoms in the system, we must draw vector fields around each atom from its position in space using quantum mechanics. We utilized the CHARMM36 forcefield to define all our atoms and residues which contained the equations defining these fields.
The root-mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of each residue was calculated as a measure for the residue instability by taking the variance of displacement of each residue from the reference position. For more, see work on Mathematical Modelling.
We find that the Asp135 has 40% reduced RMSF upon the addition of SAM ligand to the protein. From this, we can determine that the Asp135 residue plays a major role in the binding of SAM ligand to produce the product AHL-C12.
