Proceed to Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Protocol to analyze results of PCR
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Procedure:
Prepare a 100 mL of TAE buffer and add in agarose (concentration from 0.8 – 3% w/v) in a 250 mL flask and mx it thoroughly. Place the flask in the microwave, heat until the solution is completely clear. The agarose concentration depends on the band size of interest (2kb – 10kb → 1%; 1kb – 2kb → 1.5%; 200bp – 1kb → 2%; 40bp – 200bp → 3%
When the gel does not burn your hand anymore, add 5 uL of RedSafe Nucleic Staining solution (20000X) to the agarose solution. Swirl the flask gently to mix the solution and avoid forming bubbles (5uL for 100mL, 10uL for 200mL)
Pour it into the gel tray until the comb teeth are immersed about ¼ - ½ into the agarose
Allow the agarose gel to cool until solidified. This usually takes 20 minutes
Add adequate amount of 6X loading dye to DNA samples to have a final concentration of 1X. Load samples on the gel
Perform electrophoresis: 120 V for 45 minutes
Detect the bands under UV illumination
Gel Extraction
Procedure:
Excise the agarose gel slice containing the relevant DNA fragments. Remove any excess                     agarose to minimize size of gel slice

Add 500 uL of DF Buffer to the same and mix by vortex
Incubate at 50-60°C for 10-15 minutes to ensure the gel slice is fully dissolved. Invert every 2-3 minutes.
