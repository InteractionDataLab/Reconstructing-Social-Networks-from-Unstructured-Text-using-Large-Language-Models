            This construct serves as a reporter to characterize and test the functionality of the fdhF promoter, otherwise known as the hypoxia inducible promoter. This promoter is induced when the oxygen concentration in the air is below 21%. The CFP is only expressed when the conditions are hypoxic. Therefore, we used various concentrations of oxygen and examined the differential fluorescence.

The Hok toxin is a part of the Hok/Sok toxin-antitoxin system. This system regulates cell survival and allows for the maintenance of particular plasmids. As a highly toxic and stable protein, Hok expression causes cell death in the absence of Sok by initiating depolarization of the cell membrane. Sok mRNA is complementary to the leader region of Hok mRNA, allowing for the formation of a complex which inhibits translation of the Hok protein, and thereby prevents cell death.

            This part places the CI repressor of phage lambda under the regulation of the lacI promoter and lasb promtoer. This allows for expression through two alternate means. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LasB expression produces the enzyme elastase, which plays a role in pathogenicity. Characterization of the LasB promoter has revealed the presence of two distinct operator sequence, OP1 and OP2. Data indicates that both of these operator sequences are involved in LasB activation by PAI and LasR. On the other hand, gene induction can occur via the addition of IPTG, an activator of the lac promoter, as well.

            This part serves as the antitoxin portion of the Hok/Sok toxin-antitoxin system. On its own, Sok RNA is extremely unstable and is rapidly degraded, but in the presence of Hok, Sok enables cell survival. Sok RNA is complementary to the leader region of  Hok mRNA, and its binding prevents translation of the toxic Hok protein, thus preventing cell death. The bound mRNA is then degraded. Through the use of the Hok/Sok system, plasmid maintenance and cell survival can be regulated.

            This part consists of LasI placed downstream of the pH sensitive GadA promoter. GadA is a component of the glutamate-based acid resistance (gad) system, which plays a role in the survival of E. coli in acidic environments. This part enables the expression of LasI in the tumour microenvironment where pH is characteristically low. LasI encodes an N-acyl-homoserine-lactone (AHL) synthase, allowing for the production of the C12 autoinducer molecule. C12 is a quorum sensing molecule which binds to the transcription factor LasR. This complex generates a positive feedback loop, promoting the expression of more C12, which in our project induces malignant cell death through a PON2 dependent mechanism.
            </P></H3><H3 style="text-align: left;">BBa_K2493007 (Hypoxia + RBS + LasR) </H3><H3><P align="left">
            This part consists of LasR downstream of the fdhF promoter, which is a hypoxia inducible promoter. Due to the hypoxic nature of the tumour microenvironment , this system regulates the production of LasR when in the region of the malignant mass. LasR forms a complex with acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), a quorum sensing molecule, to regulate the activation of the LasB promoter.
