This project would not be possible without the help of many individuals and groups. We would like to sincerely thank everyone that has been involved with our project since its inception, leading to its eventual completion. Throughout each step of the process, we have been fortunate to have some of the most amazing support networks both at our University and in our surrounding community.              An extra thank you is extended to the following individuals:
Professor Maikel C. Rheinstadter
Dr. Rheinstadter has been central to the oversight of our project and computer modelling. His advice on both research and personal matters has helped make our project feasible and tangible, and his approach towards scienctific research has inspired many tangential aspects of our project.                  An extra thank you is extended to the following individuals:
Professor Zeinab Hosseini-Doust
Dr. Hosseini-Doust has been helpful in safety training, and guidance throughout the project. Her patience and drive helped make the project reasonable within the deadlines.
Dr. Lynn Stewart
Dr. Lynn Stewart has greatly helped in the inception of this project and integrating our iGEM work with that of the engineering faculty here at McMaster University. Her guidance has been the cornerstone of our education initiatives.
Dean Ishwar Puri
Dr. Ishwar Puri provided encouragement of the project in the faculty of engineering and offered very valuable advice during the inception of this project.
An extra special thank you to Sanofi Genzyme, for without their generosity, our project would not be possible and to the new Origins of Life Lab at McMaster University for giving our bacteria a home to originate from.
