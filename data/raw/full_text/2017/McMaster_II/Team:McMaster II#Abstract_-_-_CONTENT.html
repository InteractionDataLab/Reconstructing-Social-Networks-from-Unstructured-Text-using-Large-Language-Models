                Current chemotherapeutic agents trigger apoptosis non-specifically and induce cell death within healthy tissues.
            However, almost all tumors create a specific micro-environment with a set of parameters independent from that of the rest of the body. 
            To exploit this, we will use quorum sensing to trigger gene therapy in response to these micro-environments. Specifically, 
            we propose a novel therapeutic using a bacterial vector that expresses acyl-homoserine lactone C12, 
            the Pseudomonas aeruginosa signalling molecule known to induce cancer cell apoptosis through a Bcl-2 independent pathway. Upon detection of hypoxia and low pH, 
            known tumour microenvironment markers, C12 will be released by the bacteria containing our genetically engineered circuit to act as: (1) a cytotoxic agent that 
            induces cancer cell death, and (2) a signalling molecule that coordinates actions between bacterial colonies. Furthermore, the quorum sensing properties of C12 
            have been manipulated to activate a kill mechanism that arrests bacterial growth upon destruction of the tumour and the ensuing loss of its microenvironment. 
            Thus, we propose constructing a genetic circuit that not only removes tumours,  but also self-regulates itself to mitigate the risk of bacterial infection in the absence of cancerous cells. </P><P><I>
             Genetic circuit for tumour microenvironment-dependent activation of C12 expression.
            In environments that are both hypoxic and acidic, the AND gate induces C12 synthesis, which kills cancerous cells and ensure continued bacterial growth.
            In the absence of a tumour, the hok/sok mechanism prevent bacterial proliferation.
