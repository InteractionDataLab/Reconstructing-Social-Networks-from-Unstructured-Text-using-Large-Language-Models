Resistance
Summary
Antibiotic resistance is an important part of evaluating the success of a synthetic biology experiment.  This test is usually performed after transforming your plasmid into your chassis organism. The resistance is due to selection markers that are placed within the plasmid that contains your biological part(s). The cells that were not transformed properly will die to their lack of resistance. The remaining cells can be utilized to perform subsequent experiments.
