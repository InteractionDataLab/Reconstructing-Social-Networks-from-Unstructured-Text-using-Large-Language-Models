ATTRIBUTIONS
The 2017 BostonU iGEM team would like to thank the following people who made our project possible:
 
Mentors
Firstly, thank you to our mentors Alan Pacheco and Matthew Brenner for assisting in brainstorming our project starting in February, and providing support with laboratory training, difficult techniques, and general project support.
 
Project & Lab Support
Thank you Luis Ortiz and Marilene Pavan for lab support and especially for teaching us how to make our own batches of cell free TX-TL. Special thanks to Marilene Pavan for the trainings she provided to kick off our lab work on May 23rd.
 
Thank you to everyone who provided project advice and support along the way: Manuel Giménez, Benjamin Weinberg, Jeffrey Marano, Marisa Mendes, Emma Briars, and the STEM Pathways community.
 
Fundraising
Tiffany E. Grant King and Marisa Mendes were very helpful with fundraising support and assistance with Human Practices.
 
Presentation Feedback
We are grateful for all the great feedback on our presentations that we received from Alan Pacheco, Matthew Brenner, Dr. Douglas Densmore, Dr. Daniel Segrè, Dr. Wilson Wong, Manuel Giménez, Divya Israni, Jeff McMahan, Josh Lippai, and Jeffrey Marano.
 
Sponsors
Thank you to our sponsors: The Living Computing Project, STEM Pathways, the National Science Foundation, and IDT for providing the support necessary to power our project.
 
PIs
Finally, thank you to Dr. Douglas Densmore, Dr. Wilson Wong, and Dr. Daniel Segrè for allowing us to use their lab spaces and resources and for making our participation in iGEM possible.
 
Team Members
During the project, each team member worked on every aspect of the project. We all contributed to the design, cloning, and testing of our parts. Thomas, Stephen, and Sophia focused on the work relating to recombinases and the design and testing of our modular linker plasmids. Madeline, Sai, and Abbey focused on the characterization of the cell free system and the toehold switches in cell free. Sai led development of our in house cell free.
 
Outside of the lab, Stephen led work related to the wiki. Sai and Madeline created the JoVE video, with Abbey helping to write the script. Sai also completed the art project used for human practices. Sophia led our other human practices and outreach events. Thomas developed the model used to characterize our cell free system. Madeline took charge of lab work and performed most of our cell free tests. Abbey compiled results and was in charge of the registry pages for our team.
