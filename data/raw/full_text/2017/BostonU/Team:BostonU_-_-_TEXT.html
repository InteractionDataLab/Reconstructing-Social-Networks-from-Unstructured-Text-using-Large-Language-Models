ABOUT THIS PHOTO
SAY HI
We are the 2017 Boston University Wet-lab iGEM Team! Our research seeks to develop a platform that integrates de novo designed RNA sensors known as toehold switches with recombinase-based molecular computation systems in a cell-free system. By expanding the application space of combinatorial logic to RNAs, we anticipate applications within biological systems with characteristic RNA profiles of any complexity. Click here to learn more!
