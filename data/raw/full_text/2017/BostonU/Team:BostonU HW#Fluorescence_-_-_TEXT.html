Summary
Fluorescence is commonly used as a quantifiable marker in synthetic biology procedures. Following the completion of a protocol, for example an assay test, samples are tested in a plate reader and the results analyzed.
This microfluidic chip is designed to perform a Cell-free Toehold test; however, it can be adapted to perform alternative fluorescent tests as desired. The metering primitive dispenses accurate ratio volumes of various substances. These are pushed into the central well which matches the dimensions of a 96-well plate. The chip can then be read in a plate reader with the use of an adapted skirt.
This chip has been milled and tested, but not deemed fully fluid functional as of this time. For a more complete understanding of the chip, click the download button in order to access its CNC millable SVG files, JSON file, full device documentation and PNG files of its flow and control layers.
