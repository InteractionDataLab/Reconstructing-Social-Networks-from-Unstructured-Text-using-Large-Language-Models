MARS Repository
Summary
Microfluidic devices are often highly specific, performing entire specialized experiments on a chip. This means that these chips are not useful or relevant to an average member of the synthetic biology community.
With this in mind, we set out to make the MARS repository. This repository would consist of generalized microfluidic chips that could be useful to any synthetic biologist.
To determine what protocols synbiologist would find useful on microfluidic devices, we reached out the the Biological Design Center located at Boston University. This community of synthetic biologists gave us insight as to what procedures are performed every day in the average synbio lab. We were able to identify eight protocols integral to synthetic biology: Cell Lysis, DNA Digestion, Ligation, Transformation, PCR, Fluorescence Testing, Antibiotic Resistance Testing, and Cell Culturing. These eight protocols, as well as Cell Sorting, make up the nine chips currently located in the MARS repository.
Each of the nine chips located in the MARS repository are located within one of three subcategories:
These nine chips, each performing a basic individual protocol, can be combined together to perform more complex synthetic biology experiments.
Each chip is fully documented, providing all the necessary files for replication and usage. These files include:
Design Files
Manufacturing Specifications and Instructions
Usage and Testing protocols
As well as other useful tools and resources to make them as accessible as possible. Full chip documentation can be found on this Wiki and will be available on Github and Metafluidics as well.
These chips are currently in the water testing phase, but they provide a framework that can utilized and built upon by future iGEM teams and the synbio community to allow for biological testing and optimization. A good starting point to explore the repository from are the Cell Lysis, Cell Sorting, and Transformation chips!
