The first set of cassette plasmids contained the high-copy number ColE1 origin and the other set contained the low-copy number p15A origin. The <I>gadB</I> part plasmid used in these assemblies was sequence verified. Nonetheless, from these experiments, it was evident that constitutive expression of the <I>gadB</I> gene led to its mutational inactivation. </P><P>It is most likely that our cassette transformants were able to overexpress the <I>gadB</I> gene. However, <I>gadB</I> overexpression was metabolically-taxing to these cells, as the glutamate typically used for important cellular growth processes was being allocated towards GABA production, which was a process that did not confer a selective advantage. As a result, subsequent generations of these cells initially overexpressing <I>gadB</I> began to &quot;break&quot; the <I>gadB</I> gene. After several generations, the colonies that appeared on our plates represented only the clones containing the mutationally inactivated <I>gadB</I> gene. These cells were selectively favored in the population, as having a broken <I>gadB</I> gene allowed them to utilize glutamate sources for growth processes, providing a competitive advantage over other cells containing the functional, metabolically-burdensome <I>gadB</I> gene. <B>Observed mutations of the <I>gadB</I> gene in our cassette assemblies, which can be seen in <B>Table 1</B> below, indirectly demonstrates its intial overepxression in the original population of transformants followed by its mutational inactivation in subsequent surviving generations.</B></P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:802px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Table 2.</B> Types of <I>gadB</I> mutations observed in sequenced P8/<I>gadB</I>, P32/<I>gadB</I>,  P8/<I>gadB</I>/p15A, and  P32/<I>gadB</I>/p15A cassette plasmids.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4><I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I> transformation </H4><P> One of the main goals of our project was to genetically engineer <I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I> to produce high amounts of GABA through overexpression of the <I>gadB</I> gene. In order to do this, we first had to be able to transform <I>L. plantarum</I> via electroporation. We used the pMSP3535 vector for transformation as it contains the erythromycin resistance gene and a pAMb1 origin that is replicable in Gram-positive bacteria, including <I>Lactobacillus</I>.  The pMSP3535 vector contains a ColE1 origin for replication in <I>E. coli</I>. Due to having both the ColE1 and pAMb1 origins, the pMSP3535 was intended to be used as a shuttle vector for creating and testing our GABA overexpression cassette first in <I>E. coli</I>. The functional GABA overexpression cassette would then be transformed into <I>L. plantarum</I> using electroporation. Thus, transforming <I>L. plantarum</I> with the pMSP3535 shuttle vector was central to our project.</P><P>After using various electrotransformation protocols, we were able to successfully transform <I>L. plantarum</I> with the pMSP3535 vector. As can be seen in <B>Figure 1</B>, the <I>L. plantarum</I> transformants grew on selective plates containing erythromycin. In comparison, the untransformed <I>L. plantarum</I> control did not grow on the erythromycin plate. <B>From this transformation experiment, we have demonstrated that we were able to successfully transform our <I>L. plantarum</I> probiotic. In doing so, we have also demonstrated the functionality of the pMSP3535 vector in <I>L. plantarum</I></B>.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:452px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG>Figure 1.</STRONG> Transformations of <I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I> with pMSP3535.
