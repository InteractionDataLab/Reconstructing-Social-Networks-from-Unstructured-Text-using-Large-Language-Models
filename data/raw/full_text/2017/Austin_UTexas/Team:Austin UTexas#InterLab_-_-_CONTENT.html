The goal for the study this year is to test various RBS devices with the intention of finding which combinations yield more stable gene expression and how this might translate to various labs worldwide. Detailed below are the protocols and materials we used during the course of the experiment as provided by the iGEM Foundation. We are proud to contribute to this research endeavor by the iGEM Foundation.</P><P style="font-family:verdana">The University of Texas at Austin iGEM team is one of nine teams to have participated in all of the interlab studies to date!</P><H3 style="font-family: verdana">Protocol: Getting Started</H3><OL style="font-family: verdana"><LI>Transformed Interlab 2017 Part kit devices into <I>E. coli</I> DH5-alpha cells using electroporation.</LI><LI>Plated on LB/CAM and allowed to grow overnight at 37° C.</LI><LI>Two colonies from each plate used to inoculate 5 ml of LB/CAM liquid media and grown overnight at 37° C and 220 rpm for a total of sixteen culture tubes.</LI><LI>Next dilutions were made in 12 ml of LB/CAM to a target OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 0.02 and allowed to grow at 37° C and 220 rpm in a foil covered incubator with the lights off.</LI></OL><H3 style="font-family: verdana">Protocol: Plate Reader</H3><OL style="font-family: verdana"><LI>Allow OD<SUB>600</SUB> dilutions to grow for 6 hours at 37° C and 220 rpm</LI><LI>Take measurements every two hours, starting with hour 0, for a total of four measurement points.</LI><LI>Measurements were taken by:</LI><UL style="font-family: verdana"><LI>Taking 500<SPAN>µ</SPAN>l from each of the sixteen culture tubes and put into microcentrifuge tubes.</LI><LI>Next, 100<SPAN>µ</SPAN>l from these samples were pipetted into the wells of a Costar black with clear-bottom 96 well plate.</LI><LI>The samples were measured using an Infinite 200 Pro with the following settings: Excitation 485nm with a 9nm bandwidth and an Emission of 530nm with a bandwidth of 20nm.
