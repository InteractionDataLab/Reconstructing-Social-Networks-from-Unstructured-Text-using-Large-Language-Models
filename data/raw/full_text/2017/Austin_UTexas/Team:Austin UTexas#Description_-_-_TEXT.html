Project Description
The indigenous gut microbiota in humans possesses the ability to synthesize neurotransmitters that are hypothesized to modulate behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes of the body via the gut-brain axis (1). Since the emergence of this axis theory, researchers have been interested in genetically modifying probiotics for use as edible delivery vehicles of neurotransmitters to treat a variety of illnesses. There is limited experimental evidence regarding the effectiveness of these probiotics in the gut as this is a relatively novel concept.
Thus, our project is aimed at engineering an effective probiotic capable of producing higher levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to treat patients with anxiety, hypertension and certain bowel disorders. GABA is the neurotransmitter of interest due to its proposed anxiolytic, anti-hypertensive, and digestion-regulating effects (2-4). In order to create an accurate and translational model, we will utilize Lactobacillus plantarum as our probiotic as it is native to the human gut (5). L. plantarum is also commonly found in a wide variety of foods, including yogurt, kimchi, and cheese, allowing us to easily utilize our genetically-modified version to create medicinal food (6-8). Although L. plantarum can naturally synthesize GABA, we intend to expand the GABA-producing potential of the bacteria by characterizing and subsequently optimizing the expression of the gadB gene, which encodes glutamate decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for converting glutamate into GABA (Fig. 1) (9).
