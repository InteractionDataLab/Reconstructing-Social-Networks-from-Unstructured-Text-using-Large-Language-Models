In 1954, Briggs agar was developed (5). This media was designed for lactobacilli, but was not sufficient for many species, including <I> Lactobacillus plantarum </I>, so a different non-selective media for general lactobacilli was developed in 1960 by Man, Rogosa and Sharpe and named MRS(6). We have exclusively grown our <I> Lactobacillus plantarum </I> on MRS media. Further, we grew <I> Lactobacillus plantarum </I> in a CO2 incubator as referenced in most literature we studied (1)(2)(3). The metabolic pathways in the bacteria alters when grown aerobically to produce excess acetate (7) and less lactic acid. Because we intend to utilize this bacteria in a fermentable food, a change in this metabolic pathway would not benefit our ultimate goal.</P><BUTTON class="accordion">MRS Media</BUTTON><DIV class="panel"><UL><LI>MRS broth was prepared using 55g of Difco MRS broth powder in 1L of distilled water.

The solution was then autoclaved and stored in a 4 degree refrigerator along with the Difco MRS powder.</LI><P style="text-indent: 40px; font-family: verdana">Once we could successfully grow our chosen bacteria, we needed to  transform the gram positive, <I> Lactobacillus plantarum</I>, with pMSP3535. In order to do this, we identified and worked with a different protocol than we had ever used in our lab. We attempted several protocols, including Landete 2014 (2) and Speer 2012 (1). However, we found success using a variation of the Welker protocol(3). Welker et al.  transformed multiple strains of <I>Lactobacillus casei</I> using varying reagents and yielded different efficiencies between each strain of the species with each variation (3).</P><P style="text-indent: 40px; font-family: verdana">The Texas Tech iGEM team helped us by testing the Speer protocol after we had attempted three procedures and hadn't successfully transformed. They were not able to successfully transform using the Speer protocol which suggests that the procedure was either too simplified for researchers who have never transformed gram-positive bacteria, or was not compatible with <I>Lactobacillus plantarum.</I><BUTTON class="accordion">Electroporation of <I>L. plantarum</I></BUTTON></P><DIV class="panel"><H4>Materials Needed</H4><UL><LI>MRS liquid media</LI><LI>L. plantarum cells</LI><LI>Glass culture tube</LI><LI>CO2 incubator</LI><LI>MRS liquid media, containing 0.5 M sucrose</LI><LI>Spectrophotometer</LI><LI>Centrifuge</LI><LI>Vortex</LI><LI>50 mL Falcon conical tubes (2)</LI><LI>30% PEG 8000</LI></UL><H4>Preparation of Recipient Cell Stocks</H4><OL><LI>Inoculate 10-25 mL of -80 &amp;#2103 L.

We inoculated bacterial stocks with 10 mL of MRS broth in a CO2 incubator, without shaking, overnight. After this, we subcultured the bacteria in 200 mL of prewarmed MRS broth with 0.9M NaCl from an OD600 of 0.1 until it reached an OD600 of 0.6 (~6 hours). After harvesting the cells by centrifugation and rinsing, we resuspended the cells in 4 mL of cold water and eight 0.5 mL aliquots were divided into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.</P><P style="text-indent: 40px; font-family: verdana">The cells were washed several more times with water and 30% PEG 8000, then  stored in a -80°C freezer. These cells should stay viable for up to two years.To enhance the transformation efficiency, 600 μL of prepared cells were suspended 900 μL of cold, sterile, distilled water for 30 min as a pretreatment to electroporation.The cells were pelleted and washed several times with water and 30% PEG 8000. We added 100 ng of plasmid DNA to 100μL of cell suspension as opposed to 200 ng that the protocol recommends; our first plasmid of choice was pMSP3535. This plasmid expresses erythromycin resistance. The cells were electroporated in 2mm cuvettes using the Ec3 settings on the BioRad electroporator which corresponds to 600Ω and 3 kV, differing from the Welker protocol recommendations.
After cells were electroporated, they recovered overnight in the appropriate recovery media. They were plated on MRS agar plates with 10μg/mL erythromycin and left to grow for 2 days. </P><P style="text-indent: 40px; font-family: verdana"> Colonies from each transformation plate were grown up in MRS broth supplemented with 10μg/mL erythromycin. The subsequent day, they were streaked on  10μg/mL erythromycin MRS agar plates to verify resistance.</P><P style="font-family: verdana">We aimed to show a visible transformation of <I>Lactobacillus plantarum</I>  in addition to the resistance, so we transformed again using a different plasmid. This time we transformed with  pBTK501, a plasmid that codes for a resistance to ampicillin and expresses <I>gfp</I>.</P><H4 style="font-family: verdana">References</H4><OL style="font-size: 13px; font-family" verdana=""><LI>Speer, M., &amp; Richard, T.
