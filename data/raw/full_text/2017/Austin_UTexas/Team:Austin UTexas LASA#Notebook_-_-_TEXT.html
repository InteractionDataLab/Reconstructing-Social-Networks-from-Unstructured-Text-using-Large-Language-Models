Nov 1- Nov 3, 2016
Week 1: Did Gibson assembly, transformed and miniprepped ppddc, pEM7, and HpaBC, found that Gibson assembly for HpaBC did not work
Nov 6 - Nov 10, 2016
Week 2: Redid Gibson assembly for HpaBC, realized we were cloning our parts into YTK001 [plasmid vector]
Nov 13 - Nov 17, 2016

Dec 11 - Dec 15, 2016
Week 2: Transformation of HpaBC, ppddc plates had no colonies, redid Gibson assembly for ppddc
Dec 18 - Dec 22, 2016
Week 3: miniprepped and made glycerol stocks of HpaBC, got very low concentrations for the minipreps, looked into origin of the backbone (BTK001). Transformed gibson reaction of ppddc, plate had no colonies.
Dec 25 - Dec 29, 2016
Week 4:  Digested ppddc and backbone (BTK001) to see if there was a problem in the ori, ran on a gel, showed no insert.
Jan 1- Jan 5, 2017
Week 1: Used Zymo DNA clean up kit to get more concentrated values to send in for sequencing. Established plan for how to proceed with each part.
Jan 8 - Jan 12, 2017
Week 2: Miniprepped pp2551. Designed primers for ppddc pcr to add golden gate overhangs.
Jan 15 - Jan 19, 2017
Week 3: Sent in HpaBC and pp2551 to sequencing. Started ‘lab trainings’ with highschool students new to the club.
Jan 22 - Jan 26, 2017
Week 4: Received primers for ppddc, and diluted them.
Feb 1- Feb 9, 2017
Week 1: Ran a PCR reaction of ppddc to add golden gate overhangs.
Feb 12 - Feb 16, 2017
Week 2: Received and grew up an aliquot of new backbone (YTK001) with ColE origin because the original backbone was giving us trouble with getting high enough concentrations to sequence verify it.
Feb 19 - Feb 23, 2017
Week 3: Miniprepped new backbone (YTK001). Did a PCR clean-up of ppddc.
Feb 26 - Feb 28, 2017

March 13 - March 17, 2017
Week 2: Miniprepped ppddc + ytk001. Transformed pp2551 from January. Grew up pp2551 for glycerol stocks and Hpabc for miniprep to do a golden gate reaction with ytk001.
March 20 - March 24, 2017
Week 3: Miniprepped HpaBC and nanodropped, but concentrations too low to do a golden gate assembly. Re-did liquid cultures then miniprep of HpaBC.
March 27 - March 31, 2017
Week 4: Figured out/planned how to combine the two separate sensing plasmids (venus cassette and pp2551 cassette). Decided to do multigene assembly using a new backbone. Looked into addition of lac operon in the sensing assembly.

May 1- May 5, 2017
Week 1: Miniprepped each of the cassette plasmid parts. Transformed VCP golden gate reaction. Did a ___golden gate reaction for pp2551 cassette plamisd (PCP).
May 8 - May 12, 2017
Week 2: Made glycerol stocks of VCP. Transformed HCP, PCP, and VCP. No growth on plates. Looked into why golden gate didn’t work. Found out the low-copy origin is not efficient, and z-comp cells we used for transformation are less efficient.
May 22 - May 26, 2017
Week 3: Redid golden gate reaction of HCP, PCP, and VCP using EcoRI enzyme. When we spun down liquid cultures, the cells were all red. Re-picked colonies (white) from the HCP and VCP plate because PCP plate only had red colonies. Did a miniprep of HCP and VCP.
May 29 - May 31, 2017
Week 4: Digested and ran gel electrophoresis of HCP and VCP. No insert seen.
