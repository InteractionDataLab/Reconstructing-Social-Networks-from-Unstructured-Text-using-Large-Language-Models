Wash in .11% sodium hypochlorite for 10 seconds.
Wash in 75% of ethanol for 30 seconds.
Wash in sterile H20MiliQ water for 20 seconds.
Place on an sterile petri dish under a stereoscopic microscope.
Grab the head of the insect with tweezers then slowly remove the lower abdomen. If removed slowly, green strings will appear indicating the digestive tract. In order to avoid contamination, remove completely.
Collect the removed digestive tracts and place in a separate container.
Collect the head and rest of the body and place in a microtube.
For the digestive tract:
Place a Corning 10 μm cell strain filter over a sterile 50 mL Falcon Tube and place the material in it.
Using a 5 ml syringe plunger, grind the tissue until it is completely homogenous.
Add 500 ul of Hank's Salt Solution.
Keep grinding the remains.
Add another 500ul of Hank's Salt Solution.
In a different 50mL Falcon Tube, place a 40 μm Corning cell strain filter and filter the previously obtained solution.
Add 300 uL of Schneider's Insect medium and place on a cell culture plate.
For the rest of the body:
Centrifuge at 250 g for 5 minutes.
Remove the supernatant with a micropipette and place on a 10 μm cell strain filter.
Grind with a syringe plunger until homogeneous.
Wash the filter with 400 uL of Hank’s Salt Solution.
Transfer the filtered liquid to a 40 μm cell strain filter and add 200 uL of Hank’s Salt Solution.
Centrifuge the filtered liquid at 250 g for 10 minutes.
Add the supernatant to a cell culture plate well, then resuspend the pellet in 300 uL of Schneider’s Insect medium and add to a different well.
