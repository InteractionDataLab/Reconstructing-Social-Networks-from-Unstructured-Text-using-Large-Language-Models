Device Builder
We believe in making synthetic biology accessible to anybody.  Therefore we developed “BioBrick Builder”, a tool that simplifies the design of standardized BioBrick parts.  It also includes new technologies (such as RNAi and riboswitches), allowing the user to easily use them. For example, the siRNA design function allows to quick siRNA design, similar to those online, but ready for using as a BioBrick.  At the end the user end with a text file with the builded device and each of its individual parts in the selected standard. To use it you must download the zip folder , uncompress it and run BioBrick Builder.pyc, all the files must remain on the same folder and you require Python 2.7 to use it.
