Characterization of Tec Chihuahua’s BioBricks
We characterized Tec Chihuahua’s BioBricks (T7 promoter + RBS) + (epsE) + (T1 terminator), which can be found here as a whole [BBa_K2471002], the individual parts being (BBa_K525998) + (BBa_K143032) + (BBa_B0010). This was a relevant collaboration that will allow the team to report an essential feature of their part. The collaboration developed as follows: On October 15th Tec Chihuahua shipped the BioBrick to us. They shared us protocols to characterized by SDS-PAGE. Once the results were obtained, they were shred with the team for their evaluation and report. The complete protocol including the results can be seen below. Tec Chihuahua Collaborations
STEM Manual
We developed an experiment manual for use with elementary school children alongside iGEM teams Tec Chihuahua and Tec Guadalajara. A complete description of this collaboration including the results can be seen on our Education and Public Engagement tab. In addition to this, we had several smaller collaborations with teams for around the world, which are listed below:
UrbanTundra iGEM
We mentored and helped them develop an idea for their human practices. As their project was based on the outer space, we suggested giving lectures to kids in elementary schools. Urban Tundra Edmonton Collaborations
iGEM Oxford
We helped them fill a survey and spread it to 167 Mexican people so that they could get a real time answer. We also provided them a contact with an expert in Chagas disease, Dr. Téllez, who is located in Mexico. He gave us the contact of one of his friends in Glasgow, Dr. Héctor Díaz Albiter, who was able to help the team with their project. Oxford Collaborations
iGEM TEC Guadalajara
We sent Tec Monterrey GDA to characterize our most important BioBrick BSLA by measuring absorbance at 600 nm in 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours to observe the increase of RNA seen as biomass and blue color presence indicating more Blue Chromoprotein in each sample. TecMonterrey GDA Collaborations
iGEM Peshawar
We assisted them by giving some feedback about their project ideas so that they could develop the best option. Peshawar Collaborations
iGEM Nebraska
We had a skype call to talk about our projects and GMO policies in our country. We also shared information about CO2 regulations in Mexico. UNebraska Lincoln Collaborations
iGEM CHILE
We established a Latin American contact network where all the teams posted their profile including the individual conflicts each team suffered due to the fact that in our countries science is not supported. We provided them the contacts of iGEM Tec Chihuahua and iGEM Tec Guadalajara. UChile Biotec Collaborations
iGEM IONIS
We helped them answer a survey about GMOs in Mexico, sharing it on social media and spreading to many people locally. IONIS PARIS Collaborations
