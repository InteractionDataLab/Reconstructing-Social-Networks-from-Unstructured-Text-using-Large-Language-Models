We designed a kit that will upscale our project to be used on fields. It is composed by three parts: a mini bioreactor, a thermic shock and a purifying column.
Our first idea
We designed a solution to upscale siRNA production in a reactor that would also have a pH and temperature sensor to constantly monitor the conditions of the reactor to ensure a proper bacterial growth. The purpose of this reactor is to have a viable industrial method to produce our biodegradable, siRNA-based insecticide, at high efficiency and low cost.
While the materials shown below were used only for the protocol, its purpose to prove the reactor's functionality was fulfilled, and they can easily be interchanged for industry grade materials if the project were to be upscaled.
Shown below, a complete draft of the prototype that we built.
