 Parts Improved
We improved all of the basic parts we used by putting them into the composite parts that we used. The T7 promoter that we had at the beginning of each construct and our use of the T7 system in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Is an improvement to each of the basic parts. This system allows us to control when the gene is being expressed. This is a great advantage to us as large batch culture overexpression is very stressful on the cells. If we did not use an inducible promoter on our genes we would see significantly less pigment than our literature would lead us to expect. This is due to the fact that the genes we are using have been optimized to produce the maximum amount of pigment possible, and this process on a single young cell would be very stressful and significantly increase the doubling time of the cells. We have induced the cells after they have replicated many times and matured, this allows us to have more cells with the construct that can produce more pigment faster.
The most significant improvements of previously made parts worth discussing is the improvement to the melA and crtY-crtZ (zeaxanthin) coding parts.
The melA gene is coding sequence of tyrosinase from Rhizobium etli. This tyrosinase converts tyrosine to dopaquinone. Dopaquinone is intermediate product of melanin biosynthesis pathway that will polymerizes in an enzyme-independent reaction to form melanin. Melanin production in E. coli requires supplemental tyrosine and CuSO4. The part for the melA CDS was originally made by Kazuaki Amikura of the iGEM09_Tokyo_Tech group (2009-10-14, BBa_K193600 ). Previously, it had been used in an expression construct using the constitutive P(lac)IQ promoter ( BBa_I14032 ) and B0040 RBS (composite part: BBa_K193602 ). We have developed a different expression construct specifically for use in E. coli BL21(DE3) which takes advantage of the T7 RNA Polymerase expression construct in the DE3 cassette. This will provide tighter epxression control and help to prevent leaky expression of the tyrosinase. Additionally, the double terminator B0015 was added to increase control over the system. In order to maximize production of the tyrosinase and limit unnecessary energy expenditure by the cell, a transcriptional terminator will ensure energy is not wasted on transcribing an overly-long mRNA transcript. The melA expression construct is the improved part that we were able to characterize the most (see Results ).
The crtY-crtZ parts, containing RBSs native to Pantoea ananatis had been previously developed by Chris French of the iGEM07_Edinburgh group  (2007-10-24, parts BBa_I742155 and BBa_I742158 ). These had previously been expressed under constitutive promoters such as J23103 but not under a T7 promoter that can be used in E. coli BL21(DE3). We kept the native RBSs on these genes and incorporated it into a new part under the control of the T7 promoter ( BBa_I712074 ) and the terminator BBa_B0015 . As with the melA expression construct descried above, these new control elements will allow users to specifically control when expression starts through an IPTG induction system, as well as limit leaky expression.

These composite parts come together to complete the pathway from Eriodictyol to Anthocyanin. These constructs are separated due to the size of the genes. It would be too much of a sstrain on the cell to have all of th genes in one or even two plasmids and this is why we needed three separate constructs. These constructs are each submitted

These two composite parts come together to convert our initial molecule Glutamine into Indigoidine. The indB has been shown to increase the yields of Indigoidine as well as it is our original basic part submissions. We had to split our genes into two separate composite part submissions as the size of each was too large to allow for them to be in one plasmid.
