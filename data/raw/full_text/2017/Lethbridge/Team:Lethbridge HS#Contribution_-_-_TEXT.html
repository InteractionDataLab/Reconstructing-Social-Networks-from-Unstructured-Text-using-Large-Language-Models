 Basic Parts
3gt
The gene 3gt is from the anthocyanin synthesis pathway and converts the initial molecule Pelargonidin into Anthocyanin. This gene is from the organism Petunia hybrid. We have added this parts sequence to the registry for use in our composite part BBa_K2481105 . The basic part is BBa_K2481002
yadH
This Gene is an Escherichia coli gene that has been shown to increase the yields of anthocyanin when paired with the genes in our anthocyanin construct. We have added the sequence to the registry for use in our composite part BBa_K2481105 . The basic part is BBa_K2481004
f3h
We will be useing the gene f3h as the first gene in our anthocyanin synthesis pathway, it comes from the organism Petroselinum crispum. We have added this sequence to the registry as part BBa_K2481111 . This gene will code for a protein that converts the initial molecule flavanone into dihydroflavonol.
dfr
The gene dfr is the second one in our anthocyanin synthesis pathway. We are using the biobrick part BBa_K2481110 . We have added the sequence to the registry as our gene is from a different organism than the existing part in the registry.
ans
This gene is the third gene in our pathway, it converts the molecule created by dfr into pelargonidin. It is from the organism Malus domestica and we have added it to the registry. It is an engineered anthocyanidin synthase. Part BBa_K2481112 .
indB
This gene is from the organism Streptomyces chrmofuscus, and it is our original basic part submission to the registry. Its is part BBa_K2481001 . It has been shown to increase the yeilds of Indigoidine when used with indC. It is a putative phosphatase.

yadH Part BBa_K2481004
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
These composite parts come together to complete the pathway from Eriodictyol to Anthocyanin. These constructs are separated due to the size of the genes. It would be too much of a sstrain on the cell to have all of th genes in one or even two plasmids and this is why we needed three separate constructs. These constructs are each submitted
 Zeaxanthin Construct
Zeaxanthin composite part
BBa_K2481107
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
crtY Part BBa_I742154 .
crtZ Part BBa_I742157 .
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
This construct is in the plasmid psB1C3, and will convert our initial molecule Lycopene into our final product, the pigment Zeaxanthin.
 Indigoidine Constructs
Indigoidine composite part 1
BBa_K2481106
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
indB Part BBa_K2481001
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
Indigoidine composite part 2
BBa_K2481109
T7 Promoter Part BBa_I712074 .
RBS Part BBa_B0034 .
indC Part BBa_K1152013
Terminator Part BBa_B0015 .
These two composite parts come together to convert our initial molecule Glutamine into Indigoidine. The indB has been shown to increase the yields of Indigoidine as well as it is our original basic part submissions. We had to split our genes into two separate composite part submissions as the size of each was too large to allow for them to be in one plasmid.
