Cell-free Synthetic Biology
for the Masses
Why Cell-free?
Cell-free systems include all the necessary biomachinery to produce proteins outside of a living cell
Due to their inherent safety and simplicity, cell-free systems provide a powerful tool to synthetic biologists for engineering novel systems without the constraints of cellular life
Motivation
A lack of standardization, simplification and flexibility has limited the application of cell-free systems, including its use within the education system and Do-It-Yourself (DIY) community
Design
Lowering the barrier to synthetic biology, our project aims to create a STANDARD, SAFE, MODULAR, and USER-FRIENDLY cell-free system
Our System
A collection of standard parts for essential TX-TL components
Streamline and novel purification techniques
Software to keep synthetic biology safe
Curriculum aligned synthetic biology teaching tool
Simplified protocols
