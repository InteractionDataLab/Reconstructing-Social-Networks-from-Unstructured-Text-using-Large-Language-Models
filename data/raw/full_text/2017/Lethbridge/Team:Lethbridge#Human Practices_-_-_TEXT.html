Next vivo was developed to provide a modular, safe and accessible cell-free system for synthetic biology. The design was informed by three user groups: novices, hobbyists and experts, which lead to the development of a customizable tool dependent on the application. We addressed the dual-use potential of our system and proposed a solution to mitigate biosecurity threats, as well as evaluated how such systems should be regulated. Additionally, we tailored Next vivo for use as a safe, educational tool providing an example of how our system could be implemented. Lastly, we brought awareness to our project by engaging with our community through various events. To learn more about each aspect of our project and how it informed our design, please click below:
