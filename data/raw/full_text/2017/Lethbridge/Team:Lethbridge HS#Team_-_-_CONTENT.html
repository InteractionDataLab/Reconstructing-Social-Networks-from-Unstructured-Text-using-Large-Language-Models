 </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><DIV><DIV class="hiddendiv clearfix"><H3>Dr. Brian Dempsey</H3><P>  I am a Structural Biochemist and new to Synthetic Biology and iGEM. I love the idea of being able to make whatever I want in the lab. Previously I have used NMR and X-ray crystallography to look at protein-protein interactions. My wife is a Biochemist also, which makes dinner conversation interesting (for us anyways).   </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><DIV><DIV class="hiddendiv clearfix"><H3>Chris Isaac</H3><P> Hi there. My name is Chris and I am pursuing an MSc in Bioinformatics and Genomics. I worked with the team as a specialist mentor through MindFuel and GeekStarter's high school synthetic biology program. I discussed initial project design with the team and also helped teach them how to code their wiki through various workshops hosted by GeekStarter.   </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-4"><DIV><DIV class="hiddendiv clearfix"><H3>Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden</H3><P> Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
