In addition, we consider seriously and extensively whether our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. Therefore, we designed and carried out numerous human practices around our project, and we integrate a lot of human practices considerations into every part of our project. Besides, we also conduct public engagement and education activities to have conversations with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM.During this year, we collaborated with so many teams in project design, experiments, human practices and other parts. We got a lot of help, thanks all those amazing teams so much!</DIV></DIV><DIV class="mid-wrapper"><DIV class="title-center"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCU_China">SCU_China</A></DIV><P>As two teams in the same school, we had deep and close cooperation with SCU_China.</P><P><B>RiboJ</B></P><P>At the beginning of our project, SCU_China’s team leader Zhu Junyan privately pointed out to us that to better measure the promoters, we could use the Insulator RiboJ to get different proteins in approximately the same expression level, and her suggestion was adopted.</P><P><B>Sleep center</B></P><P>The project of SCU_China this year is about melatonin and sleep.
