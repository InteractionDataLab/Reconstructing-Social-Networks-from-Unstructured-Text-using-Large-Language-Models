Collaborations
This year, we've done a lot of works on human practices with painstaking effort. In addition, we consider seriously and extensively whether our project is safe, responsible and good for the world. Therefore, we designed and carried out numerous human practices around our project, and we integrate a lot of human practices considerations into every part of our project. Besides, we also conduct public engagement and education activities to have conversations with participates while inviting public input to shape the direction of our work and spreading synthetic biology and iGEM.
During this year, we collaborated with so many teams in project design, experiments, human practices and other parts. We got a lot of help, thanks all those amazing teams so much!
SCU_China
As two teams in the same school, we had deep and close cooperation with SCU_China.
RiboJ
At the beginning of our project, SCU_China’s team leader Zhu Junyan privately pointed out to us that to better measure the promoters, we could use the Insulator RiboJ to get different proteins in approximately the same expression level, and her suggestion was adopted.
Sleep center
The project of SCU_China this year is about melatonin and sleep. In order to get first-hand clinical data and advice from doctors about their project, we helped them get into contact with doctors working in Center of sleep, West China Hospital, Sichuan University.
iSWU 2017
SCU_China attended the China iGEM Southwest Union(iSWU) this year. We discussed our projects together, shared different opinions and gave each other suggestions to improve our projects.
ACMA 2017
We co-hosted ACMA 2017 with SCU_China.
In the academic salon, we presented to the participants the project of Vilnius - Lithuania 2016 and the project of Groningen 2012, answered questions about these two projects and offered some skills in project design.
Our team leader showed up as a judge of the preliminary contest, grading, reviewing and asking questions about the participating projects.
Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
We collaborated with SCU-China, TMMU-China and UESTC-China on the themed exhibition “GMO & Human Health” held in Chengdu Library. Details about our contributions and the exhibition can be seen in Human Practice page.
Microplate Reader
College of Life Science have no Microplate Reader to do continuous measurements, and we helped them to find one in the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital.
Second team discount
SCU_China helped us obtain the discount for the second iGEM team in the same school.
Experiment assistance
During the blackout period of the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, SCU_China allowed us to continue our experiment in their lab.
96-well plate with black background for fluorescence measurement and trypsin were gifted by SCU_China for our experiment.
RED
We offered the plasmid pKD46 of RED system to the SCU_China.
UESTC-China
iSWU 2017
UESTC-China attended the China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU) this year. We discussed our projects together, shared different opinions and gave each other suggestions to improve our projects.
Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
We collaborated with SCU_China, TMMU-China and UESTC-China on the themed exhibition “GMO & Human Health” held in Chengdu Library. Details about our contributions and the exhibition can be seen in Human Practice page.
TMMU-China
iSWU 2017
TMMU-China attended the China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU) this year. We discussed our projects together, shared different opinions and gave each other suggestions to improve our projects.
TMMU-China offered great help in optimizing our project. They suggested that we could change the microbial chassis of our dialysis part from Salmonella Typhimurium to Bacillus Subtilis to better ensure safety. We carefully evaluated the suggestion and compared the two microbes, and finally decided to follow their advice.
Exhibition in Chengdu Public Library
We collaborated with SCU_China, TMMU-China and UESTC-China on the themed exhibition “GMO & Human Health” held in Chengdu Library. Details about our contributions and the exhibition can be seen in Human Practice page.
Plasmid from TMMU-China
We designed bistable switch in our original project, but we lacked the essential genes for its construction. TMMU-China generously offered us these genes from 2016 iGEM Distribution Kit when we turned to them. We appreciated their kindness so much.
SiCAU-China
iSWU 2017
SiCAU-China attended the China iGEM Southwest Union (iSWU) this year. We discussed our projects together, shared different opinions and gave each other suggestions to improve our projects.
Salmonella typhimurium SL1344
We obtained Salmonella typhimurium strain SL1344 from SiCAU-China, which was designed in our original project.
E. coli Nissle 1917
We offered SiCAU-China the E. coli strain Nissle 1917 we obtained from SDU-China.
RED
We gave the plasmid pKD46 of RED system to SiCAU-China.
CRISPR
We got plasmids pCas9 and pTarget from SiCAU-China and used them for gene knockout.
Mentoring
The team leader of SCU-WestChina, Hongbin Yu, used to be in team SCU-China from 2015 to 2016. Our team leader has contacted with the leader of SiCAU-China for more than 2 years to give them suggestions on iGEM competition. In 2017 competition season, we still mentored  SiCAU-China in many aspects, from competion, team management, visa, to project. We are firmly collaborated.
SDU_CHINA
We got E. coli strain Nissle 1917 from SDU-CHINA, which is crucial to our project.
Hong_Kong_UCCKE
Hong_Kong_UCCKE’s project this year is also about engineering bacteria to catabolize uric acid, so we communicated with them through video chat, exchanging ideas about our projects and the problems we met in our experiments. We offered advice on uric acid testing and gene expression.
SZU-China
We had problems with the transformation of our pucR-PHT43 plasmid into B. subtilis WB800 and R179 strains. SZU-China’s project this year focuses on B. subtilis engineering, so we contacted them and asked for help. They helped us with great effort.
FAFU-CHINA , WHU-China , Shanghaitech
We had difficulty with B. subtilis transformation and we tried a lot before we contacted with SZU-China. We asked FAFU-CHINA, WHU-China & Shanghaitech for help and they gave us the suggestions and protocols. Thanks for their help.
Greece
We answered the questionnaire from Greece iGEM team.
