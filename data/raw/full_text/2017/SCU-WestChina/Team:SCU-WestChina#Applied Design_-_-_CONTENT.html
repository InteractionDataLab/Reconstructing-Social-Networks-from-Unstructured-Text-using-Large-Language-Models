                Uric acid is a product of purine nucleotide catabolism in nucleic acid constituent units. Most mammals and poultries are
                able to produce uricase, which decomposes uric acid into allantoin, then into NH3, CO2 and H2O. However,
                humans and apes lack the ability to produce uricase, so in humans uric acid is the end product of purine
                metabolism. For humans, increased production or decreased excretion of uric acid can lead to its accumulation
                in the body, causing hyperuricemia. Research shows that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor of arteriosclerosis,
                hypertension, heart failure and metabolic syndrome.

                As the concentration of uric acid in blood increases, if sodium urate crystals deposit from super-saturated extracellular
                fluids to joints, synovium or other tissues and organs, it will cause a syndrome clinically known as &quot;gout&quot;,
                including features like arthritis, tophi, uric acid kidney stones and gouty nephropathy. At this stage the
                patient suffer from acute gouty arthritis, having acute pains in the joint from time to time.

                        Controversy still exists on whether to use medications on ordinary patients with hyperuricemia: specialists of rheumatic
                        and immunologic fields state that hyperuricemia without symptoms of gout does not require drug treatment;
                        however, in the Cardiology field hyperuricemia is considered as an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis
                        and need to be controlled by medications. And for patients with refractory gout, traditional
                        drug treatment is slow, taking several years to complete, and for some of them the uric acid level
                        still cannot get low enough for tophi to dissolve. At the same time, for some patients, age factors
                        and complications like hypertension, renal insufficiency, diabetes and vascular disease have also
                        limited drug use on them.

                        Based on the information above, we speculated that the reduction of intestinal uric acid concentration can mean a reduced
                        serum uric acid concentration, thus treating hyperuricemia. Meanwhile, the use of probiotics offers
                        a perfect solution for the dispute about whether to use medications to treat hyperuricemia: the blood
                        uric acid level is lowered through proper application of intestinal microbes without the administration
                        medications.

                Refractory gout is caused by recurrent episodes of acute gouty arthritis for several years, manifested as chronic, multiple,
                destructive arthritis with pain and tophi formation and / or uric acid kidney stones. The number of such
                patients grows with the increasing prevalence of gout and the younger onset of the incidence, and these patients
                have severe illness and low quality of life. 3% of the 3 million gout patients in the United States suffer
                from refractory gout. Some patients treated by existing medications get poor result or have intolerance,
                and the treatments are time-consuming and difficult, so how to treat the disease effectively is a major clinical
                issue faced by physicians.
            </P><P>
                The biochemical basis of refractory gout is hyperuricemia, so the key to the treatment is to control the level of serum uric
                acid effectively, the target value of which is
                &lt;356Î¼mol / L (&lt;6.0 mg / dl). The daily production of uric acid by a normal adult is 750mg, 80% of which is endogenous, and
                    20% of which exogenous. The uric acid gets into the metabolic pool of urate, the daily metabolic rate of
                    which is about 60%.Of the uric acid metabolized, 1/3 is catabolized in the intestine, and 2/3 is excreted
                    through the kidneys. This process can maintain a stable level of uric acid in the body, and any problem within
                    the process can lead to hyperuricemia. </P><DIV class="img-describe">

                        In recent years, Pegloticase, a new type of uric acidâlowering agent, has brought new solutions for patients with refractory
                        gout and tophi. Pegloticase is a kind of PEG-modified uric acid oxidase which can transform uric
                        acid into allantoin, which can be easily excreted. It can reduce the level of serum uric acid effectively,
                        so as to quickly dissolve tophi and treat chronic gout. The PEG modification helps to improve its
                        antigenicity, and FDA has approved the marketing of the drug (trade name KrystexxaÂ®) in 2010. In
                        the 2012 American College of Rheumatology Guidelines for Management of Gout, the drugs was recommended
                        drug for treatment of refractory gout: âPegloticase is appropriate for patients with severe gout
                        disease burden and refractoriness to, or intolerance of, conventional and appropriately dosed urate-lowering
                        therapyâ. However, in clinical practice, it is hard to ignore the immune response caused by injections
                        (Infusion Reactions). Peter E Lipsky et al. found in 2014 that among the 169 patients treated with
                        the drug, 41% of them had high-titer anti-uricase antibodies, 40% had high-titer anti-PEG antibodies,
                        and one patient had high-titer anti-uricase antibodies even after treatment with mere placebo.
                        Because of the presence of high-titer antibodies, the efficacy of Pegloticase is low for one-half
                        of the patients treated, which means that for the small number of patients, refractory gout is incurable.
                        Furthermore, the price of the medication is high, costing around 3,500 USD per month, which also
                        limits its clinical application. Moreover, the strong uric acidâlowering effect of the drug can cause
                        very fast dissolve of tophi, leading to acute gout.
                    </P><P>The key to the treatment of refractory gout is to lower the blood uric acid concentration, but direct
                        protein contact may be blocked immediately by the IgG antibodies (of a long half-life) of the uricase-resistant
                        patient, so it is necessary to build a relatively independent immunologically privileged sites. Through
                        the establishment of a dialysis system, we try to solve the problem of refractory gout. At the same
                        time, if the efficiency of the device is acceptable, it can be used as an inexpensive treatment regimen
                        to accelerate the dissolution of gout and may be able to change the principles of treatment for chronic
                        tophi.</P><P>The treatment of refractory gout is a difficult clinical problem. FDA-approved Pegloticase is effective for some patients. However, if the patient is not sensitive to Pegloticase, it means that there is no proper treatment all over the world. However, we should not give up on every single patient. For rare diseases, we still need to focus on their health and quality of life. Our dialysis device therapy method provides an ultimate treatment for those who suffer from refractory gout and are insensitive to Pegloticase. If the device works well, it can be applied to all patients with chronic gout and facilitates the elimination of tophi in a relatively quicker and less expensive way. At the same time, we have put forward a completely new approach for the treatment of metabolic diseases: with the guidance of synthetic biology and biomedical engineering, the bacteria strains can be applied into the blood to treat any metabolic disease. It provides a brand new idea for the clinical application of microorganisms, to improve the application of immunoadsorption, for example</P><P>Immunoadsorption is a newly developed technique ultilizing the chemical ligand or anitibody to &quot;catch&quot; the substrate that should be excluded from the blood. It's used in clinics now, which is pretty like our dialysis method. However, according to our human practice, it's expensive and for one kind of immunoadsorption tube, it can only absorb one kind of substrate. However, if we can utilize our dialysis method, we can use the membrane surface display technology or inner metabolic pathway to utilize multiple substrates, which is quick and cheap, revealing the potential of our dialysis method in the future.</P><P>For the detailed design of the dialysis device, please visit  <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCU-WestChina/Hardware">Hardware Page of iGEM Team SCU-WestChina 2017 </A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="pop_why_box"><DIV class="pop_close">Ã </DIV><DIV class="pop_why_content"><H3> Loading ... </H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
