                        It's the third time for me to attend iGEM. From the youngest member in SCU-China the first year, the vice-team leader of
                        SCU-China the second year, to the team leader of the new team SCU-WestChina this year. iGEM means
                        a lot to me in many aspects. It can be my biggest thing in the undergrated stage. The competiton
                        teaches me how to do your research, how to work with the others, and how to deal with all these
                        f**king things. I’ll always treasure the guys who accompany with me through this journey. You are
                        the COOLEST.

                        This is the second year for me to take part in iGEM and the first year for me to be a truly iGEMer. I feel honored to be
                        a team member of SCU-WestChina. In this team，I am mainly responsible for the molecular experiment.
                        During this period, I gained a lot, both in the experimental skills and the capability of doing team
                        work. I found the interest of using biological method to make something useful for human being, and
                        the interst of working with a group of people to make this come true. I do appreciate iGEM for giving
                        me the chance to improve my ability and meet so many outstanding partners. I believe the spirit of
                        being an iGEMer will keep affecting me and let me do things better in the rest of my life.

                        I am a freshman in iGEM, but iGEM changes me a lot during this year. iGEM makes me know about what is synthetic biology,
                        even it makes me learn many basic roles and pratical skills in a real lab. Thanks for iGEM, I have
                        many first time experiences. Such as having a extremely formal speech in the public; spending a whole
                        summer vacation on doing experinment. And iGEM gathers us in one lab, making me have lots of friends
                        and I am honor to work with them. To be honest, iGEM also give me a chance to learn what is scientific
                        research and make me take the first step to be a scientific worker.

                        This is the first year for me to be an iGEMer. For me, it goes without saying that iGEM is a part of my college life. I learn
                        a lot from it and I make with many excellent friends, which means a lot to me. What’s more, the process
                        that we find the problem and do our utmost to figure it out togather, every time, leaves me profound
                        depression. To be honest, I will be a dentist in the future, doing research is also a part of our
                        life. iGEM, for the first time, teaches me how to do it. During a long time, I’m thinking why we
                        have to do research. Until now, I find from iGEM that we can use it to solve problem, even some clinical
                        problems. What it makes me realize that science ,or medicine , needs not only “rich experience” but
                        also “innovative thoughts”.

                        This is my first year to be fully participated in iGEM. As an oral medical student, I've always wanted to try something beyond
                        my own specialty and I chose iGEM simply out of interest. After 2 years in iGEM I finally realized
                        how lucky I was to make that choice. Other than experimental theory and skills of synthetic biology,
                        I also got a chance to be in a team full of extraordinary people. And it is gratifying to know that
                        we are able to make a difference for the patients suffering from gout. Medicine is a long journey,
                        and I'll never stop.

                        As my second year in iGEM went by, it's quite astonishing for me that I've been keened on one thing for such a long time,
                        considering that I used to shift my favourite film every day. Lol. For me, iGEM built a bridge between
                        daily school life and the real scientific research. I did gain a lot in the process, including methods
                        to shoot problems, communicate with others and wonderful friends, which I treasured most. I really
                        enjoyed the journey with all you guys.

                        Undoubtedly, my first year to join the iGEM competition is so wonderful and unforgettable. Because our team is such a great
                        team, I made lots of friends here. And for me, I learned a lot this year, especially the skills of
                        experiments and the ways to get along with other people in a team. What's more, iGEM has greatly
                        stimulated my interest in scientific research, which is of great significance to me.

                        human practice, and those could always be a little challenging meanwhile fascinating. Not only the
                        knowledge I have learned during the process of heading for our goals is vauleable for me, but the
                        emphysis of iGEM on the connection between the lab and the society benefits me a lot in my research
                        thinking. besides, constructing a device is never so easy.

                        globe. With iGEM I have formed a basic understanding of interdisciplinary studies, and it has brought
                        together such a team of brilliant friends and future researchers whom I will always cherish. I feel

                        This is the first for me to be an iGEMer. iGEM gave me a crucial chance to know about the biological research. Personally
                        speaking, iGEM is a fantastic platform for college students to learn what is real research. The most
                        important thing for me in this year is that I could combine my knowledge learned in class with the
                        requirment in the research. I think it was a precious and interesting exprience in my college years.

                        I learned about the competition from one elder schoolmate in physics who highly recommend me of iGEM. When I was deciding
                        my major, there was a pendulum between physic and biology. I appreciate iGEM for providing an opportunity
                        to study biological system using sophisticated mathematical methods in physics. My research process
                        in iGEM fully reminds me of the complexity and subtleness of organics that our current understanding
                        of life represented via mathematics seems so feeble and naïve in some occasions. In the light of
                        iGEM I may proceed my future interest in biological phenomena in a collective and statistical hierarchy.

                        It's my honor to fight together for the same goal in such a enterprising team. During this memorable period, I tried to think
                        in a totally different way to communicate with those guys who major in medicine and biology. However,
                        as I became familiar with them, I gradually understood what they meant and attempted to use compute
                        science in our project to realize our crazy idea. It's a challenging and interesting experience that
                        I may never forget.
