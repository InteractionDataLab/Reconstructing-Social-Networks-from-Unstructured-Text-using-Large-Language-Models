We used the insulator to measure the expression of eGFP driven by 10 Anderson's promoters for the first time. We updated the information of the constitutive promoter family with quantitative protein data. The data is used for our project modeling to construct the pathway.

INTRODUCTION</DIV><P>The model mainly contain two sections, one is the model of proper promoters choice due to the problem of rate-determining enzymes, another is the model of blood flow in the dialysis device. In section”II, first we will introduce the chemical equations and the relative molecular mass of crucial substrates and products and their proportion in the metobolic pathway of the urate. Then the differential equations system can be listed with the advanced Michaelis-Menten equation which describe the relatioship between the reaction rate and the concentration of substrate and enzyme. The equations system can be solved numerically assuming the rule of distribution of energy and equilibrium, from which the proper proportion of the concentration of the enzyme can be obtained. Besides, the relative capacity of the constitutive promoter family Anderson Promoter in the iGEM database can be obtained according to <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCU-WestChina/Measurement">the experiments of eGFP</A> which called the scale of promoters. Finally, with the scale of promoters and proper distribution of enzymes, the proper promoters upstream of different genes can be determined which optimize the expression with least energy consumed.In section”III,we will talk about the modeling of the hemodialysis device. The viscosity of the fluid in our experiments cannot be precisely the same to blood in real condition. To deal with this, we have proposed an equation enabling us to determine the flow density of a fluid given its dynamic viscosity as long as the power of our pump is controlled. Besides, the cleaning-out rate of urate acid is depicted as a function of flow density by solving the diffusion equation or namely Fick’s Law.

Urate metabolic pathway</B></P><P>In the metabolic pathway of uric acid of microorganisms, urate is catalyzed into hydroxyisourate by uricase, then hydroxyisourate can react spontaneously and form allantoin. Allantoin is highly solubility and can be easily excreted from the body. The above mentioned new uricase drug is based on this mechanism. There are anther two enzymes that can speed up this process</P><DIV class="img-describe">
