Blocking the Urate Storm in the Blood
SCU-WestChina 2017 Project
Abstract
Hyperuricemia and refractory gout are caused by the high urate concentration in the blood. Considering there are still debates                     on whether the drug should be used in the asymptomatic hyperuricemia patients and the drug resistance                     of the refractory gout patients, new approaches are eagerly needed. We constructed the urate metabolic                     pathway in the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 and applied it in the gut to reduce the urate concentration                     in the blood indirectly. In addition, we built a dialysis-like device combined with modified bacteria                     to utilize the urate directly in the blood. Our solutions provide a suitable, long-term and non-drug                     treatment for the asymptomatic hyperuricemia patients and an ultimate treatment for the refractory gout                     patients.

Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in human. Increased production or decreased excretion of uric acid can                     lead to its accumulation in the body, causing hyperuricemia. If sodium urate crystals deposit from super-saturated                     extracellular fluids to joints, synovium or other tissues and organs, it will cause a syndrome clinically                     known as "gout". Controversy still exists on whether to use medications on asymptomatic hyperuricemia,                     refractory gout can be still hard to treat even with the new drug. And those are the reasons why we start                     our project. More
Based on the background, our project will put forward a new method to control hyperuricemia and treat refractory gout from                     the following two aspects: 1. Control of ordinary hyperuricemia (in the intestinal tract); 2. Treatment                     of refractory gout when Pegloticase treatment is of no avail (with methods of dialysis) More
We used the insulator to measure the expression of eGFP driven by 10 Anderson's promoters for the first time. We updated                     the information of the constitutive promoter family with quantitative protein data. The data is used                     for our project modeling to construct the pathway. More
We collected the information from various tubes. As a medical school team, we got the first-hand feedback from clinical doctors                     to make our project really meaningful. And it's our duty to spread the medical knowledge to the public                     to practice the saying: "Health related, life entrusted." More
