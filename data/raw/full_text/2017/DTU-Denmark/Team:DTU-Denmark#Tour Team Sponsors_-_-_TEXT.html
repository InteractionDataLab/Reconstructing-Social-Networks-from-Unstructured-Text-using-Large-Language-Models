Team
This years DTU-Denmark iGEM team, the DTU Biobuilders, have been comprised of individuals from a range of different backgrounds all contributing in their own way to the development of the final detection kit. The project would not have been possible without the support of our sponsors.

Dionysia Valkani
MSc. Pharmaceutical Design and Engineering, 4th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
My motivation for doing iGEM was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project in the interesting area of synthetic biology. iGEM involved a great deal of independent research, requiring initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. I was confident from the beginning that this experience would be extremely exciting and valuable for both my studies and overall general development.
What did you work on during the project?
My main focus has been on the laboratory work, being involved in both designing and performing experiments. I was also part of the administration group, contributing in coordinating and project management tasks, and the team-building group, organizing team-development activities.
Frederik Bayer Frøhling
MSc. Biotechnology, 2nd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
The iGEM competition presented an opportunity to work on a long term and extensive project, to experience what it takes to make a project like this work was exciting to me. Besides than synthetic biology was always one of my favorite fields of biotechnology, and that interest has not been made any less in doing this project.
What did you work on during the project?
I was in the economy group and in charge of the initial funding, and in the teambuilding group. I was part of working with Biotech Academy working on the Biosensor. My main responsibility has been working in the laboratory.
Ivan Doudka
BSc. Electrical Engineering, 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
The DTU BioBuilders provided me with a unique opportunity to work as a part of an interdisciplinary team and explore applications of electrical engineering within the biomedical field.
What did you work on during the project?
I have been mainly working on our hardware and outreach. I am responsible for the microfluidics device and most of my outreach-work has to do with public relations. I also worked with a graphic designer to create a single theme across all presentation-media and platforms.
Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I joined iGEM because I wanted to test my capabilities and knowledge in trying to solve problems that affect people globally, to meet equal minded students across disciplines, and exchange ideas with them.
What did you work on during the project?
I was part of the administration group and the economy group. I participated in the organization of the lab exercises during BioBrick tutorial. I also worked in the lab on the Biosensor project, substrate discovery and testing and BioBrick design, and on dry lab performing data mining and analysis. Lastly, I was part of the wiki group.
Line Meyhoff Aastrup
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 4th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I have always wanted to work on an interdisciplinary project that resembles project work on the industry. Being part of the DTU BioBuilders allows me to learn useful skills for project management and apply what I have learned in theory on real life problems.
What did you work on during the project?
I was part of the administration group and helped with the development of the microfluidics device. In addition I was main responsible for overseeing the economy and the wiki.
Mohamad El Lakany
MSc. Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, 3rd semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I gained so much experience participating on The Biobuilders team 2016 that I, post-Jamboree 2016, then and there on the Hynes Convention Center Hall floor, decided that I wanted more of the iGEM experience. I did so, by seeking participation on this year’s team - It was simply too gratifying for me to pass.   I thoroughly enjoy the learn-as-you-go approach to things - It seems more intuitive to me. In addition to that I appreciate all the things I am subject to learning, that I did not expect to learn. I sincerely believe that this kind of work contributes to my development into a prudent, patient and diligent being.
What did you work on during the project?
I coordinated and organized various ad hoc tasks for our team and -for our annual biobrick tutorial. I was main contact for communicating our project to the outside world in addition to being involved in the administrative-, the outreach- and the human practice part of our project.
Philip Hau Sørensen
BSc. Human Life Science Engineering, 5th semester.
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
At my first year at DTU, I had a lecture session on synthetic biology. It was immediately clear to me how synthetic biology was the future of recombinant DNA technology, a field I have been interested in since childhood. When I heard that DTU had a student team working with synthetic biology, I couldn’t help but apply right away!
What did you work on during the project?
I worked on outreach, human practises and as part of the wet lab team. I was responsible for the 4th International InterLab Study of the iGEM competition. As part of the wetlab, I was involved in the design and testing of our BioBricks. As a side project to this, I did some modeling on the enzymatic reactions of the BioBrick device I developed.

Supervisors
Christopher Workman
Associate Professor, DTU Bioengineering
What is your motivation for joining the DTU BioBuilders?
I supervise DTU Biobuilders and iGEM projects because I believe in a future where synthetic biology is used to benefit society in new and diverse ways. The next generation of engineers and scientists will make the breakthroughs that will make this possible and it is exciting to be a small part of the development of this next generation.
What did you work on during the project?
My role was most often moral support and encouragement. There are so many challenges when going into the lab and experiencing repeated failures. This can be very trying on the patience and it is important to keep the spirits up in order to persevere.
