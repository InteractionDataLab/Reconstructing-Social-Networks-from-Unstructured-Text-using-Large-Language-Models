            I find the world of synthetic biology to be very exciting, and I really enjoy the process of getting things to work in the lab. I wanted to be a part of the the DTU BioBuilders because I saw it as a good opportunity to learn a lot while utilizing my skills and meeting nice and likeminded people.
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            My focus has been on the lab. I have been working with discovery of new protease substrates for the venoms we have been investigating. I have also been involved in the interlab study, as well as the long and tedious process of producing BioBrick results in the lab.

            My motivation for doing iGEM was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project in the interesting area of synthetic biology. iGEM involved a great deal of independent research, requiring initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. I was confident from the beginning that this experience would be extremely exciting and valuable for both my studies and overall general development.
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            My main focus has been on the laboratory work, being involved in both designing and performing experiments. I was also part of the administration group, contributing in coordinating and project management tasks, and the team-building group, organizing team-development activities.

            The iGEM competition presented an opportunity to work on a long term and extensive project, to experience what it takes to make a project like this work was exciting to me. Besides than synthetic biology was always one of my favorite fields of biotechnology, and that interest has not been made any less in doing this project.
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            I was in the economy group and in charge of the initial funding, and in the teambuilding group. I was part of working with Biotech Academy working on the Biosensor. My main responsibility has been working in the laboratory.

            I gained so much experience participating on The Biobuilders team 2016 that I, post-Jamboree 2016, then and there on the Hynes Convention Center Hall floor, decided that I wanted more of the iGEM experience. I did so, by seeking participation on this year’s team - It was simply too gratifying for me to pass. 

I thoroughly enjoy the learn-as-you-go approach to things - It seems more intuitive to me. In addition to that I appreciate all the things I am subject to learning, that I did not expect to learn. I sincerely believe that this kind of work contributes to my development into a resilient, patient and diligent being.
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            I coordinated and organized various ad hoc tasks for our team and -for our annual biobrick tutorial. I was main contact for communicating our project to the outside world in addition to being involved in the administrative-, the outreach- and the human practice part of our project.

            At my first year at DTU, I had a lecture session on synthetic biology. It was immediately clear to me how synthetic biology was the future of recombinant DNA technology, a field I have been interested in since childhood. When I heard that DTU had a student team working with synthetic biology, I couldn’t help but apply right away!
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            I worked on outreach, human practises and as part of the wet lab team. I was responsible for the 4th International InterLab Study of the iGEM competition. As part of the wetlab, I was involved in the design and testing of our BioBricks. As a side project to this, I did some modeling on the enzymatic reactions of the BioBrick device I developed.

            I'm very interested in biology and so I wanted to experience a real lab and learn about the process. It has been fun but also a bit intimidating.
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            I assisted with the interlab study and I helped with some of the creative work related to the Wiki page.

            I supervise DTU Biobuilders and iGEM projects because I believe in a future where synthetic biology is used to benefit society in new and diverse ways. The next generation of engineers and scientists will make the breakthroughs that will make this possible and it is exciting to be a small part of the development of this next generation.
            <U>What did you work on during the project?</U>
            My role was most often moral support and encouragement. There are so many challenges when going into the lab and experiencing repeated failures. This can be very trying on the patience and it is important to keep the spirits up in order to persevere.
