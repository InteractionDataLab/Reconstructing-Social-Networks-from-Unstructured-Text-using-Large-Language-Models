Team:DTU-Denmark/TeamBuilding
Team Building
Breaking the Ice
Once the team was created, we decided to set up an informal event where we would have the chance to get to know each other. We met up for pizza, beer, and wine at the university. Being at the beginning of the project, these hours were very important for us to bond.
BBQ at Ostenfeld Dormitory
After a long day brainstorming and working on our project strategy in the office, we met for a well-deserved BBQ at the courtyard of one of the dorms at the university campus.
Trip to Delft and Amsterdam
This year’s European iGEM Meetup was held in Delft, the Netherlands from the 7th to 8th of July. We took this opportunity not only to bond with other iGEM teams and discuss about our projects, but also to relax from the hard working days in the lab during the summer. Before going back to Denmark, we also spent one day in Amsterdam sightseeing.
The Great DTU BioBuilders Bakeoff
Designing a different kind of team building activity, we organized an event where the team was split in subgroups that competed to create the best cake. The team that made the most tasteful cake was announced as the winner of the great DTU Biobuilders bake-off.
Goodbye Lunch for Aleksander
One of our team members, Aleksander, had to leave earlier for the States, as he was going for a semester abroad. Thus, we decided to have a lunch to say goodbye to him and arranged to meet him again in Boston for the Giant Jamboree!
Visit to Terrariet Reptile Zoo
We were very excited when we discovered that one of the snakes, Bitis gabonica, with which we are working in the project could be found in a reptile zoo, here in Denmark. For this reason, part of our team planned a day trip to visit the Terrariet Reptile Zoo.
