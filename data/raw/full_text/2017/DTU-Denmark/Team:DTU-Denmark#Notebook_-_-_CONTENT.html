Protocol #2 - no colonies appeared when digest was extracted from a gel.<I>CMP</I> and <I>AFT</I> did an assembly of a part that consists of single chain avidin and amilCP with his-tag flanking a double cut site (BBa_K2355302) with two protocols.

Protocol #2 ligation with gel extracted digest.<I>PHS</I> ligated the part from the 20th of October, it was later transformed onto a X-gal + IPTG LB Cam plate. 
The plates with X-gal showed blue colonies for the LacZ part that contained the promoter and RBS (BBa_K608003).

These colonies was then used for cPCR and also an overnight culture.
