Human Practices
We have engaged the general public and specifically the next generation of academics, scientists and lawmakers of the opportunities of synthetic biology.
We have, together with the danish organization Biotech Academy’s Biosensor project, made a free kit that will be distributed to high schools (see more here ).
Danish legislation is strict on synthetic biology, and it is not possible for high school students to make their own plasmid modifications. We have thus done the plasmid purification for them thereby enabling them to get hands-on experience with synthetic biology at their local school  - while still prioritizing safety and respecting the regulations of the law.
We tested a simplified version of this kit at our biobrick tutorial where we invited iGEM teams from the Nordic countries: Danish, Swedish and Norwegian teams (see biobrick tutorial for more)
We have further engaged and initiated the public into the opportunities of synthetic biology through our events, lectures and our outreach activities on social media platforms.
We are being published in DTU avisen and The technologist (next issue in January). A documentary is being made about our project, where the iGEM work and our daily efforts are being documented. The documentary is filmed and edited by documentarist: Jeppe Mølgaard. For a more detailed walk through of our Human Practices, please refer to the dedicated Human Practices section of the site.
