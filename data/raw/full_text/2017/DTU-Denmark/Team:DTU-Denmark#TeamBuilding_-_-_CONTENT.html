Before going back to Denmark, we also spent one day in Amsterdam sightseeing.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="colp-7 rmvpadmarg"><H3><FONT size="4">The Great DTU BioBuilders Bakeoff</FONT></H3><P>Designing a different kind of team building activity, we organized an event where the team was split in subgroups that competed to create the best cake.
