Collaborations
Introduction
The ability to collaborate is essential in a scientific field such cross-sectional as synthetic biology. Our team has collaborated with other iGEM teams in numerous ways as described below.
Helping a new team get on track
We sent our own interlab strain to the Lund iGEM team to help them complete their interlab study,as they experienced some issues with transforming cells with the interlab devices themselves. In doing so, we made sure to abide by all the regional regulations on transporting GMO between borders.
A global problem needs global outreach
In order for a Northern European team like us to do a project that focuses on a tropical disease like snake envenomings, it is not sufficient to merely get inputs from experts within our own region. In our efforts to reach out and engage with health professionals from around the world, we got a lot of  help by Amazonas Brazil and the AshesiGhana teams. They have all helped us to get into contact with professors and doctors from their region with experience in researching and treating snake envenomings. This has led us to get feedback on our project from all major areas of the world that are affected by snake envenomings.
Ethics
We have participated in an ethic discussion hosted by team Uppsala, with attendance from other iGEM teams from Bielefeld-CeBiTec, Grenoble-Alpes, Wageningen UR, and Technion-Israel. We discussed the responsibility that scientists have to present their results in a proper way, while at the same time maintaining the interest of the public.
The Danish iGEM teams
The Danish iGEM teams in general have done a lot to help each other’s projects. In addition to hosting events for each other, as stated below, we have helped each other out with general feedback and advice throughout the project period.
Events
As part of our efforts to collaborate with other iGEM teams, we have attended and hosted a range of different events throughout the year.
5th annual BioBrick tutorial
This year, the DTU Biobuilders hosted the 5th BioBrick tutorial from the 10th-12th of March. SDU-Denmark, UCopenhagen, Chalmers-Gothenburg, and UiOslo_Norway participated in the tutorial.  The BioBrick Workshop is an initiative to educate iGEM team members with the basic lab competences required to perform a synthetic biology project as ambitious as iGEM. It also provided an opportunity to introduce fellow iGEMers to general lab safety and cloning techniques, while strengthening the social dynamics within the teams. To read more about the BioBrick tutorial, please take a look at our BioBrick tutorial page.
Nordic iGEM conference
In June, DTU BioBuilders went to the Nordic iGEM Conference (NiC) in Copenhagen hosted by UCopenhagen. During this weekend, DTU BioBuilders connected and shared their projects with the other Nordic teams.  DTU BioBuilders presented their project in a mini-Jamboree, where the requirements set by iGEM Headquarters were in focus. The mini-Jamboree gave DTU BioBuilders the opportunity to get a feel of the big iGEM competition in Boston and refine their project. Besides the mini-Jamboree and workshops, there was also time for barbeques and other social activities to get to know the other teams.
European MeetUp
In July, DTU Biobuilders went to the the European MeetUp in Delft hosted by TUDelft.  DTU Biobuilders presented their project at a poster presentation. It was a great occasion to share ideas and explore new possibilities about the project.
The 4th International Synthetic & Systems Biology Summer School (SSBSS)
The teams sent representatives to a summer school in synthetic biology, to reach out and present the project to their peers. At the summer school, we met up with the iGEM team from Greece, and presented our projects to each other, giving each other feedback and making suggestions for improvement of the projects.
Danish ethics and wiki workshop
This year SDU-Denmark hosted a workshop with focus on ethics and development of the wiki page. All the Danish iGEM teams participated in the workshop.   At the workshop, there were lectures and discussions on bioethics and how to make a good wiki page.
