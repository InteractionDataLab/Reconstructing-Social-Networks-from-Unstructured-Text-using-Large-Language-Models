The assembly of both amilCP with and without his-tag was successful.
PHS introduced a RFC[25] restriction sites into the LacZ part (BBa_2355313) by doing a PCR with restriction sites in the tails. The PCR was done only for the lacZ part of the BBa_2355313 composite part (Effectively amplifying the BBa_I732005 part).

BioBrick assembly
CAL and CMP put on an overnight cultures of: (BBa_K2355006, BBa_K2355008, BBa_K2355014, BBa_K2355015, BBa_K2355025, BBa_K2355026, BBa_K2355032, BBa_K2355033, BBa_K2355037 and BBa_K2355039, BBa_K2355001, BBa_K2355302).
PHS plasmid prepped the overnight culture from the 23th of October (BBa_K2355313). It was then digested for verification. The bands indicated that the single chain avidin was present. That, along with the lacZ activity, indicates that the part was assembled as planned.
