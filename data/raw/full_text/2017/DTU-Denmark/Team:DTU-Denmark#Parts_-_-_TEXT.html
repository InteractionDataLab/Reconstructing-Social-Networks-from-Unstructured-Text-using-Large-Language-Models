BBa_K2355001
Protein-domain
Peptide linker that is cleaved by Bitis arietans and Bitis gabonica venom. When translated, this linker should contain 5 x repeats of the ALK motive identified by our experiments to be cleavable by the venom of Bitis sp.

BBa_K2355002
Coding
This is a modification of the amilCP part from the Uppsala 2011 team (BBa_K592009). It has a 6x His-tag attached to the C-terminal end of the protein

BBa_K2355302
Composite part
This part contains two major protein domains: A single chain avidin domain to bind the device to biotinylated surfaces, and amilCP with his-tag. Between the two domains, NgoMIV and AgeI restriction sites are present, to allow for insertion of RFC[25] part.

BBa_K2355313
Composite part
This part is used for detection of snake venom. The Beta-galactosidase, encoded by lacZ, should allow for an decrease in detection time.
