Prototype
The detection of snake venom in human blood samples is an important part of our project. We aimed to create a spectrophotometer that could be attached to a mobile phone and a device that could prepare the blood for being analyzed with it.
Spectrophotometer
Figure 1: Spectrophotometer.
The creation of a pocket-sized spectrophotometer allows for more applications. A spectrophotometer is now available to more people in developing countries, due to its low cost, size, and convenient design.
The spectrophotometer’s 3D-model can be easily modified to fit most smartphones as well as any optical filter. The fact that it only needs the smartphone and does not rely on an arduino or other external devices, nor needs any external power source, means that it is very portable.

App
Figure 2: SV Detector app.
The SV Detector app is developed to work with the spectrophotometer and is capable of analysing pictures of the samples. The app captures the spectrophotometer’s output that is then analysed in order to give the operator feedback on the type of snake that the victim has been envenomed by, if envenomed.
