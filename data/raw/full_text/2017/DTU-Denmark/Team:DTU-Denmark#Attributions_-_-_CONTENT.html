As the previous years, the team had an open application round to select high school members that are interested in learning more about synthetic biology. <B>Minh Greulich (Nærum Gymnasium, 3rd year)</B>
During the summer period, Minh has contributed to both the InterLab study, and the Biosensor project. She was especially helpful in the testing of the Biosensor protocol, for which no noteworthy experience in the lab was actually an advantage.  
 </P></H3><H2 id="bioengineering" class="bottomborder" align="center">Support from DTU Bioengineering</H2><P>We have had some great help from our supervisors, who have guided us throughout the whole process of making this project a reality.<B>Christopher Workman</B> has been the primary supervisor of our team. He has dedicated a lot of his time to consult us, and has been great in representing us internally in our department. Besides helping us with practicalities, general management of the team and giving scientific advice, he has helped with design ideas for our prototype as well. He came up with the idea of using Biotin/Avidin interactions to attach our detection protein device to a surface in the incubation chamber of our device. Chris was instrumental for the substrate  modelling part of our project.<B>Rasmus Frandsen</B>, our secondary supervisor, has provided feedback on our cloning techniques. He was also involved in designing USER-primers for USER cloning of our biobricks, however, we opted not to use the designed primers, as it was easier for us to order de novo synthesized composite parts as gBlocks from IDT, thereby making USER cloning obsolete.  <B>Martin E. Kogle</B>, our residential lab technician, has helped us a lot with getting familiar with the lab, and he has lended us both equipment and chemicals crucial to our experiments. He has also been of great use with helping out when we were unfamiliar with a technique. His apprentice, Sofie L.K. Jensen, has helped us prepare buffers and solutions etc. on a daily basis.   <B>Soumya Kannan</B> provided valuable feedback during the idea generation.</P><H2 id="ack" class="bottomborder" align="center">Acknowledgements</H2><P>Beside people directly associated with our team, we have had some great support from people within and outside of our university</P><H3 class="bottomborder" align="center">Snake venom</H3><P><B>Andreas Hougaard Lausten</B> (postdoc, co-founder of Biosynthis, co-founder of VenomAb, on Forbes 30 under 30) have provided some great feedback on the feasibility of our diagnostic tool, and he has contributed with ideas to improve our project in general. He has also helped us with our biobrick design, as he inspired us to construct a composite part using β-galactosidase, to amplify the output signal of our detection device. <B>Clara Guerra Duarte</B> (Ph.D., Fundação Ezequiel Dias) has helped us design and optimize our biobricks, by giving us feedback on the different fusion proteins we designed. As an expert in venomics, we have been able to get a lot of feedback on how we should expect venom to affect our constructed fusion-protein.  <B>Manuel Giménez</B> (Graduate student, Boston University) is a former participant and instructor in iGEM, who helped form the very first iGEM team in Argentina. He has given us general feedback on our project management, and has helped us get into contact with both iGEM teams and researchers from South America.<B>Angela Alice Amadeu</B> (Ph.D., Instituto Butantan) has given us advice that has led us to test our biobricks in the presence of blood thinners such as heparine, as this reagent is often used in the treatment of snakebite victims, and as this reagent often hinder the effect of serineproteases. Being an expert in the venom of <I>Bitis arietans</I>, she has been able to help us gain more knowledge in the venomics of the <I>Bitis sp.</I><B>Lotte C.G.
