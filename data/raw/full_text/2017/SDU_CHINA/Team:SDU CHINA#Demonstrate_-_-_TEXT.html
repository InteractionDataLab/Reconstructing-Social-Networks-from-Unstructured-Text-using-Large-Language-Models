Fighting NSCLC with an invincible opponent of PD-L1 can be more workable?
In our project, we have creatively designed the safe and precise gene therapy for PD-L1 to treat NSCLC, which we make sure there is no danger to human body. ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:SDU_CHINA/design ). Although this is the first time for our team to participate in iGEM competition, our experiments and operations fully meet the iGEM Safety Committee standards.    ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:SDU_CHINA/Safety ).
In the section of Human Practice, since our experiment is to use CRISPR technique cutting PDL-1 gene to reduce the immunologic escape of tumor cells, we design our HP to make public know more about the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cutting-edge molecular therapy. So we carried out community propaganda, freshmen propaganda and teaching activities. The use of antibiotics in experiment reminded us of investigating its overuse in our life, for misuse of these antibiotics increases the danger of antimicrobial resistance.
On the other hand, human practice improved our project. We interviewed clinicians, knowing the status of NSCLC and determining the project scope. Then we set up communication about project by cooperating in human practice. Last, the questionnaire showed that people pay more attention to the safety of therapy, which provides guidance for us to design suicide system in our project.

In addition, we greatly completed detecting the starting efficiency of the hTERT and survivin promoters in eukaryotic cells. It showed the expression efficiency of hTERT and survivin promoters in different cancer cells and non-cancer cells from multiple angles. Besides, our work also well revealed the effect of EGF on hTERT and YM155 on the suvivin promoter. The result indicated that EGF with same concentration has stronger effect on hTERT in H460 than that in A549. hTERT promoter was more sensitive to EGF inH460 cell line. However, YM155 with same concentration has stronger effect on survivin promoter in A549 than that in H460 cell line, indicating that survivin promoter was more sensitive to YM155 in A549. Besides, our results also showed that the sgRNA targeting PD-L1 worked well, it can cut PD-L1 effectively. ( https://2017.igem.org/Team:SDU_CHINA/Results )
Generally speaking, although we have not finished the whole project, the present results indicated that our work is going well, and it is a very promising prospect!
