BBa_K2321005 is a GFP device made up of R0040 and E0840, containing tetR repressible promoter and GFP. tetR repressible promoter is like a switch, which determines the expression of GFP.
BBa_K2321006 and BBa_K2321007 are composite parts, which can be combined with tetracycline when both promoter and terminator exist.
For more details, please refer to the results .
From BBa_K2321008 to BBa_K2321011 are composite parts with color, with or without promoter. They can expresss lovely color as the Figure 5 and Figure 6 show. In order to celebrate the success of these parts construction, we painted our team badge with these two bacteria as Figure 7.
