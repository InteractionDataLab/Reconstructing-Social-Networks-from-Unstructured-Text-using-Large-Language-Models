<<< Two PIs >>>
Huiqing Yuan is the first PI who gave the fund support for the iGEM team SDU_CHINA. We’d like to appreciate professor Yuan and her research team members here!
Guijie Ren is the second PI who is responsible for the whole project performance. She worked aside the students in this summer vacation, and involved in solving some academic and nonacademic problems.
<<< Instructors >>>
Dr. Keli Tian is responsible for organizing some activities, such as meet-up activity of team members, propagation iGEM at school campus.
Xiaoyan Hu is a senior experimentalist. Being an instructor of SDU_CHINA, she is responsible for all substance supply of whole team members in the lab. And she worked with care and maintenance of the instruments.
Qian Cao is skilled in a variety of experimental skills and responsible for the safety of whole team members in the lab. All students were trained before the experiment starting by her.
Ying Xiao is also an instructor of the team. She helped the team members to learn safety rules and fill some safety forms of experimental operation. And she taught the students how to use equipments safely and the emergency response
<<< Advisors >>>
Mengqi Jia is a phD. student from Shandong University. He helped the SDU_China team to design the project, and gave some important technique direction in the experiments. Also, he helped us to resolve some problems we met in the lab.
Huiyu Li has some iGEM experience, and she gave some advice and suggestion on the project design, modified the project and helped to analyze the experiment data. She also gave some important suggestions on wiki writing.
Fei Xie is a graduate student from Medical school, Shandong University. She is good at some skills and directed the team member experiment technologies.
<<< Students >>>
Ziming Chen is a student leader. He is responsible for the overall work and trivial things work of the team. In the project, he completed the plasmids construction of hTERT and survivin promoter, detection and analysis of the promoter activity. He also helped to find the mathematics models.
Min sun is another student leader of SDU_China team. In the teacher and classmates’ eyes, she is a versatile person. In addition to doing some experiments, she is mainly responsible for the human practice work, including propagation iGEM in Shandong University and in Shandong Science and Technology Museum, as well as design team logo, production poster, and making video, etc.
Zhuoxuan Jia is also a student leader. She is good at the skill’s learning in the lab and always full of confidence. She is responsible for insertion of sgRNA targeting pd-L1, and function analysis of crispr-cas9 with sgRNA system in the cell lines.
Lamei Huang is a girl who loves sports. She is mainly responsible for construction of standard parts, and she also submitted the standard parts to the iGEM HQ, writing some wiki which is relevant to parts.
Xianghui Zhao is a silent girl who worked with part building, such as culture E.coli, extract plasmids, enzyme digest, running electrophoresis, analysis of the sequence, and doing some preparation work, etc.
Hanyue Zheng completed the construction of TetR expression plasmid, TetR repressible GFP device, and fdHF promoting GFP device. She also detected the functions of these plasmids.
Suqing Liu assisted Hanyue Zheng to construct some recombinant DNA. And Suqing Liu is also responsible for some human practice activities, such as iGEM propagation to public, communication with OUC_CHINA, etc.
Kankan Cao is good at PCR work, so he is in charge of some PCR work and other experiments. Besides that, he wrote some wiki which is regarding the judging form.
Xiaohui Liang participated in some experiment work, for example, making gels for electrophoresis, extracting plasmids, doing PCR, analyzing data and preparing the experiment etc.
Yurong Zhang assisted Ziming Chen to detect the activity of promoters in the cell lines, such as extracting plasmids, running electrophoresis etc. And she is also responsible for writing some wiki which is relevant to the safety.
Pei Mu is from information engineering college, Shandong University. He analyzed our experiment data and applied the mathematic model into the experiment for modification the project.
Jiawei Feng is a design engineer of our web, a student from software college, Shandong University. He is responsible for logo design and wiki writing.in our team.
<<< Others >>>
Dr. Xudong Hu is a doctor of Shandong tumor hospital. Before we started our project, he gave us some introduction about the basic situation, diagnosis and treatment of Lung cancer which inspired our project.
