Before we started our project, we interviewed clinicians, knowing the status of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. So we determined our projec---to use CRISPR/cas9 removing PD-L1 gene in tumor cells, reducing the immunologic escape of tumor cells. We need to let the public know NSCLC and cutting-edge gene therapy. So we publicized our project to the public, explained gene therapy and issued some questionnaires. From these questionnaires, we know that people pay more attention to the safety of gene therapy. This made us constructed our second plasmid which would commit suicide if the plasmids were transferred into the nontumorous cells, which make our gene therapy very safe for patients. Besides that, the use of antibiotics in experiment reminded us to investigate its overuse in our life, so we also finished another social investigation: overuse of antibiotics.
Interviewing clinicians Shandong Provincial Cancer Hospital
At the end of May, we interviewed clinicians of Shandong Provincial Cancer Hospital to understand the nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in clinical. Chemoradiotherapy is still play an important role in the treatment for NSCLC. Molecular targeted therapy is limited for its hihg expensive cost. And gene therapy is confined to its complexity of intracellular signal transformation pathways, the gene therapy still has a long way to go.
Survey of caner treatment and gene therapy
We made a multi-city wide-ranging questionnaire in summer, and we received 1,000 questionnaires from different age groups and different occupations to learn about cancer treatment and gene therapy. We hope that our survey can help to us improve our project, and it did. The best concerned problem is safety of gene therapy, so we constructed the second plasmid to commit suicide when they are transferred to nontumorous cells.
Survey of cognition of antibiotics overuse
We also made an investigation on the cognition and use of antibiotics in the urban area of jinan city. We hope that we can raise the awareness of antibiotics usage by our efforts.
