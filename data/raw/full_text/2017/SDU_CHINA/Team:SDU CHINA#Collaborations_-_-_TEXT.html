Collaboration with OUC-China
From August 9 to August 13, We co-organized the summer camp with OUC-China team. We communicate some experimental ideas, specific technical issues and mathematical modeling, etc. We did not only make a valuable friendship between the two teams, but also attracted some college students and high school students who didn’t participate in iGEM, expanding the iGEM influence in Shandong Province.And, with the help of OUC-China, our team successfully completed the model of the effect of EGF on hTERT promoter and YM155 on survivin promoter.

Collaboration with SCU-WestChina
This year, when we knew that the SCU-WestChina team needed the E.coli strain Nissle 1917 to start their iGEM project, we told them that our lab reserved the strain and mailed it to them as soon as possible. Later, at the request of the SiCAU-China，we also agreed SCU-WestChina team give some of the strains to SiCAU-China.

Collaboration with JNFLS
In the summer，JNFLS team needed to detect the starting efficiency of the anaerobic promoter fdhF, and they don’t have the proper instrument. So we helped them to finish this section of experiment using a Blood-gas analyzer which can detect PCO2 and PO2. And this result is important for them. Meanwhile, we shared each other's social resources and had some other cooperations.

Communication with other iGEMer at CCIC in Fuzhou
 
From August 26 to 28, 2017, the fourth Conference of China iGEMer Community was held in Jinshan Campus of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. We and nearly 50 colleges and universities from all over the country and high school iGEM team, more than 300 iGEMer attended this conference. The iGEMers and scholars launched a warm and enthusiastic sharing around the iGEM theme. We showed our project and got some valuable advice and suggestions.
