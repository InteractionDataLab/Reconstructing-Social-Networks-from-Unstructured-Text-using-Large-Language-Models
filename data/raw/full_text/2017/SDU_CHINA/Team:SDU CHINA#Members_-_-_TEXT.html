As being a professor, my research interesting focuses on: Analysis of functions of genes related to multidrug resistance in cancers via genetic and epigenetic modification mechanisms; Screen assays for novel drug discovery from natural chemicals. Identification of antitumor chemicals by targeting proteasome, autophagy, cell cycle checkpoints, inflammation and multidrug resistant proteins and enzymes, and investigation of genes and signaling pathways involved in cancer response to small natural chemicals by proteomic analysis and microarray expression profiling. The research projects are funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Key Basic Research Program of China, Shandong Natural Science Foundation. We have published articles in a number of journals, including J Med Chem, Cell Death Dis, Carcinogenesis, Cancer Lett.
Guijie Ren
 
I am the second PI of iGEM team SDU_CHINA, as well as the Molecular Biology teacher of some team members in Shandong University. Passion and enthusiasm are the two most important things accompanying my work, so I spare no effort in helping my brilliant students to go forward in their road of chasing dream. I pay hard effort, but meanwhile, I gain much more than that. It is their bright future that lights my teaching career.

I am glad to make friends with my classmates. In the team I will help the classmates to learn safety forms of experimental operation. Wish all to achieve satisfactory results in this summer!
Fei Xie
 
I am a graduate student in Shandong University, major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I am a kind of person who is easily moved and somewhat of a perfectionist, even in small things, and I do need more self-confidence to see a thing through to the end. I love reading, which can give me happiness and quiet. I really enjoy my life now, although I still have many dreams to chase. In this summer, being an advisor, I am very glad to be involved in iGem and synthetic biology.
Huiyu Li
 
I am an undergraduate senior student from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. My major is pharmacology. I had participated in iGEM competetion two times previously, so I have some experience. Being an advisor of SDU_CHINA, I gave some advice and suggestion on the project design, plasmid construction method and some data analysis, etc.

Ziming Chen
 
I am Ziming Chen.This is the first year for me to join the iGEM competition. It’s my honor to be the leader of our team. As a new team, we have many difficulties to overcome and lot of new things to learn. I want to thank all the team members. It's you guys who company me through the whole year. Personally speaking, iGEM is a fantastic platform for college students to learn what is real research, and how to collaborate with others in lab experience. My passion towards research will be continued even after I've become an iGEMer. The experience of working together for one goal will become an important part of my student life forever.

Zhuoxuan Jia
 
It's a precious experience for me to join 2017 SDU IGEM team. IGEM competition brings me a chance to design and practice a whole project, which is the first time for me.During the experiment process, honestly, there always troubles and problems come out. But they taught us a lot after we get through. In short, IGEM gives me a hot sense of uplift in research and the joy of experiment.

Hi, every one，I am Suqing Liu from ShanDong University. As a student of medicine, I have been a crazy fun of biology for a long time. Surely, the IGEM is a competition. But for myself, I would rather to treat it as a long time chat when every member of this team try to exchange their own special ideas with each other. Although the daily work always try to bother me, I have learned a lot from this experience anyway.Thanks for my team and thanks for the IGEM.
