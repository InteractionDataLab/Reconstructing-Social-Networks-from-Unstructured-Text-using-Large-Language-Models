Both hTERT and survivin are tumor-specific promoter, so the parameter of starting efficiency after transfection is most important.  In order to explore the specificity and sensitivity of starting efficiency for each promoter, they were respectively inserted into luciferase reporter vector. Then we selected NSCLC cell lines A549， and measured the relative luciferase expression activity of the consructed plasmids in A549 cell line in different time points,which represent the starting efficiency of each promoter.

TK plasmid in A549 cell line, after hTERT was inserted into pGL-3 vector.

TK plasmid in A549 cell line, after survivin was inserted into pGL-3 vector.
