This year we have designed more than 20 parts, including 4 basic parts. All of the parts are designed ourselves and most of them have been tested to insure their reliability. To see their specific function, you can click  here  to learn about our project, or browse the specific page on  parts.igem.org  by clicking on the part numbers.
----------* Composite Parts *----------
We have designed a series of composite parts this year, and most of them could be useful tools for constructing other devices or systems. There are also some new devices such as BBa_K2310106 , BBa_K2310107 , BBa_K2310108 .
