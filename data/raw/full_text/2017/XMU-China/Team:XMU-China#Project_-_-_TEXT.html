TITLE
The team's project description must be documented on their iGEM Team Wiki by the deadline. The project description should be 1-3 paragraphs and only needs to include an up-to-date explanation of the project. This description should be posted on your Team Wiki home page (example URL: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Example).This description will not be used to judge your project. It serves to provide some background on what your team has been working on so far and what you hope to accomplish. It also provides other teams the opportunity to see what you're working on so they can reach out for collaborations or troubleshooting if they are exploring a similar topic.
TITLE
Once the wikis are frozen, users can no longer make any changes until they are unfrozen after the Jamboree. Please be sure to read through the the wiki requirements! No extensions will be provided (no exceptions!) and judges will begin their assessment on November 2, so make sure all changes are done by 11:59PM EDT.PLEASE NOTE: During week of wiki freeze, iGEM experiences higher than normal traffic which can lead to strain on our servers and sessions timing out for users. iGEM HQ recommends that users do not wait till the last days to work on and/or finish their wikis. Edits done during the final week should be very minor edits (spelling mistakes, updating images, etc.).
TITLE
All iGEM 2017 Team Wikis are required to have the iGEM Login Bar. The Login Bar includes essential links, tools, and information for all users: both wiki creators and viewers. The judges need these tools. The iGEM Login Bar is a 20 pixel high, full-width menu bar that exists on all 2017.igem.org pages. It contains: iGEM related pages, wiki tools (edit, history, watch, etc.), search tools, team information (not released yet), login, and the site menu. It serves as a quick navigation tool for all users and must be maintained on all of your team wiki pages as a result.
