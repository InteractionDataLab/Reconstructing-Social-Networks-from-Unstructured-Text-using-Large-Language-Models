March
- Our team was formally founded.
- All student members learned the fundamental knowledge of molecular cloning and iGEM.
- All student members looked through the previous excellent projects and learned the basic notion of synthetic biology and iGEM.
April
April
- We divided into three groups and started to brainstorm separately (and we reported each’s progress every weekend).
- Our team was formally accepted by iGEM.
