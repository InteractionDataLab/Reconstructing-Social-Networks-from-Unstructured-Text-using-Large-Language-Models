Introduction
BBa_K1357009
BBa_K540001
-----* Introduction *-----
We also improved the characterization of two existing BioBrick Parts although we've participated in the InterLab Measurement Study . The parts we tested are BBa_K1357009 and BBa_K540001 .

The fluorescent protein is used widly as a reporter, such as GFP and RFP. To enrich the kinds of fluorescent proteins, the iGEM11_Uppsala-Sweden supported some other colour proteins like BFP and YFP which are from the coral Acropora millepora, amilCP. In this year, we want to verify the characteristic of BFP.
Firstly, we got BBa_K1357009 from the 2017 DNA Distribution Kit Plates and transformed it to the E.Coli DH5α. After a one-week incubation, a big bacterial colony grew on the plate.
Secondly, we extracted the plasmid from the bacteria, digested with XbaI and PstI, cloned it into plasmid BBa_J61002 with the promoter BBa_J23100 , then transformed into E.coli DH5α again. We observed the strong blue just one day later. The result shows that BBa_K1357009 works well.
-----* BBa_K540001 *-----
Meanwhile, we also tested BBa_K540001 using the reporter BBa_I13504 . The Cobalt induced promoter BBa_K540001 was added before the reporter BBa_I13504 , then the constructed plasmid was transformed into E.coli DH5α to measure the fluorescence intensity and OD600
The result shows that there is not a specific relationship with the concentration of Cobalt. There might be some problems with this promoter.
