First, we visited the Xiamen Yundang Sewage Treatment Plant, a company with the capacity of 300 thousand cubic meters of sewage treatment per day, to preliminarily understand today's treatment of domestic wastewater. We were shown around the whole process of sewage disposal and a variety of large-scale equipment. The technical manager told us heavy metal concentration in daily life sewage was actually very low, however, the industrial wastewater contained significantly much more ions of heavy metals, thus they normally do not need to concern about heavy metal treatment methods.
All in all, we drew the conclusion that our <STRONG>target groups</STRONG> are those industry plants, environmental offices and citizens in water polluted areas.</P></DIV></LI><LI class="work"><DIV class="relative"><LABEL for="work11">Zenland Mineral Water Company</LABEL><SPAN class="date">Jul 5<SPAN class="superscript">th</SPAN>2017</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="content"><P>
Next, in order to further investigate the standard and commonly used methods of drinking water detection, we visited the Zenland Mineral Water Company which is located in the Wulao Mountain in Xiamen University. In the water quality monitoring laboratory, professional staff told us that the water quality inspection in China was mainly in accordance with the national standard law. Interestingly, no biological assay was applied in large scale, to this extent we believed that <STRONG>our inspirations would be a major innovation in water disposal industry</STRONG>.</P></DIV></LI></UL><SPAN class="subtitle">-----* Laws and Relations *-----</SPAN><P>Laws regulate the human world steadily and sustainably, without which we may fall into disorder. Thus, we have investigated heavy mental pollution in particular areas of China, and regulations referring to genetically modified organisms to see what we have already done and what we should do.</P><UL id="timeline"><LI class="work"><DIV class="relative"><LABEL for="work10">Water pollution control China &amp; World</LABEL><SPAN class="date">Jul 12<SPAN class="superscript">th</SPAN>to Jul 24<SPAN class="superscript">th</SPAN>2017</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="content"><P>
The metal ions in water will change the water pH value, resulting in deterioration of water living environment. While the pollution intensity exceeds self-regulating capacity, they will eventually lead to serious due deterioration to the positive feedback regulation. The heavy-metal pollution with the characteristics of bioaccumulation, transformation process complexities as well as difficulties in forming insoluble complexes have arisen in Guangxi, Yichang, Gansu and other places in China recently.
Additionally, China plays an increasing role in the water pollution remediation work, within domestic and international circumstances. Consequently, a series of measures for preventing and controlling industrial pollution such as &quot;Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan&quot; and &quot;<A href="http://www.ipe.org.cn/">Water Pollution Map</A>&quot; have gradually been perfected.
At the same time, we made clear requirements of the detection limits of various pollutants (See below). However, how to achieve a low cost and efficient detection of water quality is still a big challenge.<SPAN class="HPsilver"><STRONG>Detection Limits of Water (partly)</STRONG></SPAN>
At present, the water heavy metal detection and processing method of the mainstream can be divided into <STRONG>physical, chemical and biological three categories,</STRONG> among which, the physical examination is mainly detected by different metal specific absorption spectra and emission spectra of qualitative and quantitative, and chemical detection method is the use of electrochemical method for determination of the dissolution potential quality and anode. However, due to the extremely low concentration of heavy metals in water, thus producing <STRONG>considerably weak signal,</STRONG> resulting in <STRONG>large errors.</STRONG> In addition, experimental requirements of physical and chemical determination are comparably high which means they cannot be applied to real-time detection in nature. Compared to these, biological detection had <STRONG>a lower threshold,</STRONG> with the a variety of the corresponding signal forms, can completely overcome the harsh natural conditions of field testing. The disadvantages of the traditional physical and chemical methods generally have higher cost, narrow scope, second pollution possibility. Biological treatment utilizes microorganism adsorptions, plant enrichment means which can effectively reduce the toxicity of metal ions. In addition, with the use of <STRONG>synthetic biology tools,</STRONG> engineering bacteria can better fit for heavy metal processing requirements.
By contrast, the public still concern about the safety and ethics behind biological control, to a certain extent, prohibiting the wide development of biological technology in water treating. In the aspect of the development of synthetic biology, all countries in the world have made clear GMO Safety and management regulations. See below.</P></DIV></LI><LI class="work"><DIV class="relative"><LABEL for="work9">Laws Exploration Mathematical Model combining per capita GDP &amp; environmental quality</LABEL><SPAN class="date">Jul 18<SPAN class="superscript">th</SPAN>to Aug 9<SPAN class="superscript">th</SPAN>2017</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="content"><P>
Because there are many health determinant factors, including market goods and services, such as healthcare, investment time and environmental conditions, such as air pollution, environmental sanitation and water purity, Grossman put forward the model of human capital demand in 1972 healthy, healthy as a kind of capital goods for the first time, be regarded as different from other human capital &quot;health capital&quot;. The model considers the demand for &quot;good health&quot; can be used to explain the supply and demand curves, and the optimal decision for health needs by wealth and survival time in the life cycle of constrained. in 1991, Grossman and Krueger first proposed the environmental Kuznets curve (referred to as EKC), to describe the relationship between economic growth and environment are analyzed, their environment and economic growth in many countries the data shows that this the relationship between emissions and economic growth of some environmental pollutants in some countries of the present an inverted U-shaped curve relationship, which is in the initial stage of economic development, economic growth will cause great damage to the environment quality, but when the per capita GDP more than a &quot;inflection point&quot;, the economic sustainable growth will in turn promote the improvement of environmental quality. 
This year, XMU-China made a plan to investigate the relationship between environmental pollutants and economic, and finally chose the Grossman model to explore the relationship and the amount of GDP emission environment.The Grossman model (the classical economics on health demand model) was divided into three kinds of emissions of pollutants and GDP effect, which were the scale effect, structure effect and the impact of technological progress effect respectively. <STRONG>Fujian province (China)</STRONG> was selected, which maintained 12 major rivers in the province's 143 water quality evaluation. In the 143 sections of the overall water quality evaluation section, only 3 of them did not meet the water quality standard. The main items exceeding the standard was <STRONG>ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, COD, BOD five dissolved oxygen,</STRONG> all the statistics were from the data source for the 2016 statistical yearbook of Fujian Province, <STRONG>between 1996 to 2009.</STRONG>
Due to the fact that the industrial solid waste and industrial smoke and per capita GDP regression failed to pass the test, therefore, the EKC test lists four other pollution emissions and per capita GDP on the table. There is no Kuznets inverted &quot;U&quot; curve relationship among per capita emissions of dust, per capita wastewater discharge and sulfur dioxide emissions per capita per capita GDP. And per capita industrial emissions and per capita GDP shows no Kuznets inverted &quot;U&quot; curve as well. Unlike the inverted U-shaped curve of developed countries and emerging countries in general, Fujian's environmental Kuznets curves are two positive type u or ∽ type. The Fujian pollutant emissions in 1990s were relatively slow, and growing significantly fast from 2000, at which time the overall pollutions in Fujian were at a high level. In recent years, with the industrial wastewater and industrial dust effectively governance, Fujian comprehensive environmental pollution level of growth trend to be well controlled.</P></DIV></LI></UL><SPAN class="subtitle">-----* Public and Promotion *-----</SPAN><P>Working on synthetic biology in a lab is amazing, but sharing our enthusiasm can be even more wonderful.

Teenagers had the opportunities to extract DNA from bananas while learning about its structure and how it was produced inside cells. Through the extraction process, we described the purpose of each step, and invited them to consider the chemical and biological theory principles behind what they were doing. Both their parents and teachers encouraged us to hold more activities like this in order to help teenagers to put theory into practice. Now, there were no subjects referring to Synthetic Biology, however, most of students consequently found it interesting and considered it was important to life.<STRONG>As a result, we decided to put our efforts to spread the word about synthetic biology to the next generation of scientists</STRONG>.</P></DIV></LI><LI class="work"><DIV class="relative"><LABEL for="work7">Xiamen Science and Technology Museum</LABEL><SPAN class="date">Jul 29<SPAN class="superscript">th</SPAN>2017</SPAN></DIV><DIV class="content"><P>
