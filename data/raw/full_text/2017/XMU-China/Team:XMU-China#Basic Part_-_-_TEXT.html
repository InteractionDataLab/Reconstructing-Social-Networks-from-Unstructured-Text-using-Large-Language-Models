This year we have designed more than 20 parts, including 4 basic parts. All of the parts are designed ourselves and most of them have been tested to insure their reliability. To see their specific function, you can click  here  to learn about our project, or browse the specific page on  parts.igem.org  by clicking on the part numbers.
----------* Basic Parts *----------
This year we have designed four basic parts. BBa_K2310100 is our favorite basic part, which is obtained from X. luminescens and encodes LuxAB, emitting luciferase. Besides, we designed other basic parts to construct our detecting system.
