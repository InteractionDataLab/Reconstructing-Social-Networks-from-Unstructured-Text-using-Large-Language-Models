Chips
Darkroom
Besides the microfluidic chip usd in East-Wind, we have many other chips designed for freeze-dried bacteria checking and the part LuxAB, BBa_K2310100 . We also put the design drawing of the darkroom we use in the accessory below. You can get the CAD files of all the designs here .
We designed the chips in the way of continuous integration, which means you will see the chips from the basic chip in the device, then add the LuxAB, then add the multichannel, then add the valve, and then add the modularization.
-----* Chips *-----
I. The basic chip in the device
This design is what we use in the accessory. The size of the sampling hole and the tube has been tested many times. Making and using of this can be found here . There is a piece of the semipermeable membrane between two layers to avoid bacteria liquid leakage.
II. Add LuxAB
This is the primary chip we design for LuxAB , which is for luciferase outputing chemiluminescence when adding the substrate.
It has an inherent switch that you can't get the signal until a few seconds after adding the substrate. And it only needs one hour or less to get the signal after induction. So we design a set of cell and tubes to add the substrate to the reaction cell (the biggest cell); you can use this construction to control the time you open the switch (get the signal).
This chip has four sampling channels and one detection channel. We have tested the fluid flow in this chip, and we sent this kind of chip to BIT .
The layers should be piled up with the order of 1 to 7 we mark in the picture. And the follow design can be assmbled in the same way.
III. Add the multichannel
This design has four sampling channels and two detection channels. It enables us to have two channels of the detection the signal which will make it a less-error equipment.
IV. Add the valve
In this design, we make a valve in the chip so that you can control which sampling channel to add the sample.
We also have this design of two sampling channels and four detection channels. You can control which detection channel to output.
In this section, which of those two designs is more practical needs more experiments to test.
V. Add the Modularization
This chip should be assmbled into two parts of “1-2-3-4-4.4” and “4.6-5-6”, which we name as partA and partB. You can use partB with different partA in which we have added different engineered bacteria.
-----* Darkroom *-----
I. Primary Darkroom
We design this darkroom to make a steady optical environment for our accessory to work. You can see how to assumble and use it in our wiki .
II. Darkroom Drawer
When you use this dark room, you can put your chip in different layers for your special need.
