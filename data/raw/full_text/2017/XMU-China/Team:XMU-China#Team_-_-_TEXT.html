PI
Baishan Fang
Dr. Fang is a distinguished professor in College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, and he is also the director of the Institution of Biochemical Engineering of Xiamen University. His research mainly focuses on synthetic biology, mining and the transformation of enzyme, construction of bio-molecular machines. He has been our PI since 2010 and his advice and equipment support are also helpful this year as ever.
Keju jing
Dr. Jing is an associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, his research mainly focuses on amino acid dehydrogenase-catalyzed synthesis of chiral amino acids and directed evolution of glucose dehydrogenase and application of biomimetic cofactor. This is his second year participating in iGEM and working as our PI. Thanks to his suggestions and supports in theory and laboratory, we can work on our project much easier.
