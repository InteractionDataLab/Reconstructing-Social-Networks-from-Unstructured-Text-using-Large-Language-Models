Introduction
Our project aims to control Drosophila’ courtship behavior by overexpressing dopamine in their brain. In our plan, we will make 7 parts, 3 plasmids with a specific promoter.
First of all, we need to design the PCR primers with Primer Premier 5. Then we run pfu PCR to clone our target gene out of the Drosophila’ genome. After that, we do the digestion of vector pUAST-3xHA and do the ligation by In-fusion cloning, then do the transformation. The last step in molecular construction is plasmid extraction.
Then we come to the Drosophila’ part, which includes microinjection, screening, testing parts by rtPCR and behavioral experiments.
All the details are shown below.

Behavioral Tests
Material
Canton.S, a kind of wild fruit fly from Canton, was used as control group. W1118 is a kind of fruit fly with a genetic mutation in the white gene. We transferred the plasmid to the flies and use them as treated group.
In the screening process after microinjection, the red eye gene W+ in the plasmid was used to determine whether the plasmid successfully inserted the chromosome. We picked the red eye fruit fly from the offspring. Then we interbred the red eye flies with the Cyo/Sp;Tb/Sb white eye flies to show which chromosome this gene was integrated into.
The relationship between genes and phenotypes is as follows: Cyo/curly wing, Sp/hairy, Tb/short body, Sb/short hair. The Cyo gene and Sp gene are located in the second pair chromosome of flies while the Tb gene and Sb gene are located in the third pair chromosome of flies. The homozygote of these genes is fatal. In the flies we use, these four genes are located on different chromosomes.
The hybridization is as follows:
P means the parent (red eye fruit fly). PⅡ/PⅢ mean the second/third chromosome from the parent (red eye fruit fly). By looking at the color of PⅡ/Cyo;Tb/Sb and Cyo/Sp;PⅢ/Tb fruit fly's eyes, we can know which chromosome the gene was integrated into. And in these flies, the gene is steadily hereditary. Then we reserve fruit flies that have been transferred to the target gene for subsequent experiments.
