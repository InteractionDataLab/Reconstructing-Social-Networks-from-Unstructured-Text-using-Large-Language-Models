Here you can find the information about the people who have contributed to the project. We would like to express our gratitude to our instructors for their continuous support and encouragement, and we would like to acknowledge all the others who provided valuable advice and essential support.
The following is our amazing team, Tongji_China.
Jianfeng Zhou
I’m a Junior student of Tongji University, majoring in biotechnology. I was keen on life science since I was in high school. Last year, I applied for being an intern of team Tongji SHANGHAI, having learned a lot about iGEM and its operation pattern. In iGEM 2017, I am the captain of team Tongji China, involved in almost every part of the project, hoping to explore more about synthetic biology, together with my team members.
Qian Zeng
I’m a junior student of School of Life Science and Technology, Tongji University. I am interested in synthetic biology, which drives me to take part in iGEM. I have a good logical sense and I am good at giving fresh ideas during our brain storms. I really cherish this great chance to cooperate with such a nice team, and to solve various problems during plasmids construction experiments.
Cichen Zhang
I am a junior student who is majoring in biotechnology and an iGEMer who is enthusiastic and confident about all unknown things all the time. During the project, I was responsible for the behavior test about drosophila and also participated in human practice. I enjoyed working with an efficient team and really learned a lot from this project. Out of the lab, I like to spend my spare time in reading novels, watching movies and playing ping-pong.
Wei Zhu
I am an undergraduate from the School of Life Science, Tongji University. I’m responsible for the behavioral experiment. I also play an important role in the interlab work. The most intresting things for me is to study new things. I thinks it is a honour for me to take part in iGEM.
Chenyu Song
I am a third year student in Tongji University at Shanghai. Since I heard about synthetic biology and all its possibilities, I wanted to take part in a project from scratch and build a complete system. That’s why I joined the iGEM team. During the summer, I specifically worked on doing the modeling of the behavior of drosophila. I am glad to help the team making real discoveries after a modelling work and numerical calculations. This iGEM contest experience was therefore a good training exercise of teamwork and software development.
Zhifei Shi
Nice to meet ya! I'm Zhifei Shi, the Hp director of team Tongji China. It's my honor to join iGEM party and work with my best teammates. Except doing experiments, my work is to generalize synthetic biology to people form every group and cooperation to other iGEM teams. I hope more and more young people can explore synthetic biology with us and become a new star.
Xinran Chen
I am Xinran Chen, a junior student in Tongji. I majored in life science and technology when I first came to Tongji university, but later I changed my major and now I major in water supply and drainage science and engineering. But my classmates in the former college are my good friends so I'm very glad to prepare the iGEM competition with them this time. I love painting very much, so I’m responsible for the design of the team logo, team clothes, poster and so on. Hope we can have a wonderful journey in America!
Ruimin Xu
This is my last year as an undergraduate student in Tongji University. I used to spend most time in my lab, doing experiments limited to my researches, which would definitely be a little pity for me if I didn’t join iGEM 2017. iGEM provides a best platform for students like me, to broaden our horizons and temper ourselves. This experience makes my college years more colorful. The tougher the problem we met, the deeper impression it left me.
Huan Wu
Hello, I am Huan Wu from Tongji University. As a student majored in biotechnology, I’d like to exploring undiscovered biological phenomena and explaining how life works. During the three years of learning, I found that researching is not as right as rain. Sometimes, I think dream is perfect but reality is very skinny. However, skinny is just for that someone without target, I believe if I hold on to my dream, the best is always yet to come. Where there is a will, there is a way.
Giovanni Riva
I joined the Tongji iGEM team while part of a double degree program in China between Politecnico di Milano and Tongji University. I’m interested in how software can enable other fields to understand and design more complex systems. This has unsurprisingly led me to explore Biology and the intricate mechanisms that govern it, starting from the Code Of Life.
Yihao Wang
Hey! I'm Yihao Wang, the biggest fan of Biology and it's so nice to meet you guys~ My major is Machinery which is a new way to be connected to iGem. Communicating with GIANTs and getting this chance to this competition is my pleasure! Besides, I learn German and mean to study further in Germany. In my spare time I usually hang out with my friends or playing the piano... Thank all of you again!
Instructors
This section is dedicated to our instructors. Most of our team members are still bachelor students and had no, or only minor, knowledge about how to actually work in a lab before getting in touch with iGEM. Our instructors played an important role in starting our project.
They guided us in the long process of shaping our abstract ideas into real, scientific strategies and are the reason why we can now proudly say that we are able to organize and execute our own experiments. Here, we want to tell you how each of them supported our project.
Changsheng Du
I am a professor of School of Life Science and Technology in Tongji University, the primary PI of the iGEM team. During the year, I guided the iGEMers to do realize the importance of biosafety while doing experiments. Since my research field is molecular immunity and signal transduction, I also gave them quite a lot suggestions on plasmids construction and primer designing. I strongly feel that these young iGEMers are keen on life science and synthetic biology, which drives them to work really hard which may finally lead to a great success.
Ye Leng
I am the second PI of the iGEM team, a professor of School of Life Science and Technology in Tongji University. My research mainly focuses on the signal and epigenetic mechanisms of the occurrence and development of tumor, based on tumor cells. I gave the iGEMers advice during brainstorms and kept following the process. I’m happy to work with our iGEM team, the iGEMers are quite diligent and enthusiastic. Good luck to our team.
Lei Xue
I am a professor of School of Life Science and Technology in Tongji University. My research field is molecular genetics, using fruit fly as a model animal. One day, the iGEMers came to me, saying that they were curious about the male-male courtship behavior of fruit fly. I gave them my suggestions and guide them to read large amounts of relevant documents. We also keep in touch during the whole behavioral experiments. The iGEMers have strong animation and enthusiasm, which helped them to the final success. Wish them good luck!
Jiayu Chen
I am an assistant professor of School of Life Science and Technology in Tongji University. It's really a great honor for me to join the iGEM this year. I will be the guiding teacher of the 2017 iGEM representative team of Tongji University. I have strong confidence in all of the members, for their extraordinary courage and dedication. While what really matters to us is nothing but the precious experience. Wish them enjoy the Jamboree in Boston!
