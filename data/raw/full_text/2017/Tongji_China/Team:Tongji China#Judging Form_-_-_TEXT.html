Integrated Human Practices
We want to link more and more people from every group to synthetic biology and iGEM to enjoy this party! In integrated human practices, we improved ourselves, gave a help hand to other iGEM teams and made a great education and public engagement. We made friends with Shandong University and send the plasmid which was used by Tongji_China 2016 to help them get through it. On August 19th we invited Fudan_China, Shanghaitech, STJU_BioX_Shanghai and ECUST to give community members a lecture. What makes us proud is that we had held two OPEN NIGHT(with network LIVE) and designed the first biology S.T.E.A.M-education course in China in last year. And we made a toolbox for children to experience biological experiment by themselves with the help of Fablab Shanghai. Compared with traditional education, our course, toolbox and OPEN NIGHT spreads knowledge to our society in a way which is interactive, original and easy to understand.

Education and Public Engagement
We're very proud of our Education and Public Engagement project because we had held two OPEN NIGHT(with network LIVE) and designed the first biology S.T.E.A.M-education course in China in last year. And we made a toolbox for children to experience biological experiment by themselves with the help of Fablab Shanghai. Compared with traditional education, our course, toolbox and OPEN NIGHT spreads knowledge to our society in a way which is interactive, original and easy to understand. So we think these are educational innovations! OPEN NIGHT focus on simplifying knowledge and spreading it accurately to everyone from all the groups. Everyone can come and listen to the lecture without invitation and express their ideas freely. We also had a live webcast so that people who cannot come to OPEN NIGHT can watch our LIVE via live network. As for the S.T.E.A.M course, we have already contacted some high schools in Shanghai and will add this course as a elective course.
Engagement
Model
We think our modeling has the following advantages:  1.  We unite existing solutions which were proved feasible to our project and modeling. And we established a new line with factors which were gained from our experimental data to compare the effect of pest control. We found the deficiencies in the old method and improve them.
2.  Specific reduction destinations are given for the specific problem of pest control.
3.  We have made a great prediction model in a short time and fished out a condition in which we can control the population of pest.
4.  The change of the population in the medium term was simulated by Leslie matrix, which verified the sustainability of the method in controlling pest population.
5.  The expected results obtained by the model are highly operable and feasibility.
