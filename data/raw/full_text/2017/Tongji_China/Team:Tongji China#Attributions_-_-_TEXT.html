Acknowledgements
We want to thank all the professors, teachers and students who have offered us great help during our project.
General support
First and foremost, we would like to show our deepest gratitude to our instructors: professor Changsheng Du and professor Lei Xue. Professor Du, a respectable, responsible and resourceful scholar, has provided us with the advices on the project’s idea and on the molecular experiments. As an experienced instructor of Drosophila melanogaster, Professor Xue helped us a lot on the behavioral experiments. He has also offered us many suggestions on our human practice activities.
We also want to thank for our instructor Ye Leng who help us gain some financial support from our university and Jiayu Chen who is going to take us to the Jamboree!
Lab support
We want to thank for all the labs which provided us with the experiment reagent, including Professor Fanglin Sun’s lab, Professor Shaorong Gao’s lab, Professor Lei Xue’s lab and Professor Changsheng Du’s lab. We definitely couldn’t finish our project without their kind help!
Funding support
Thanks to Professor Jing Zhang, who is in charge of our project in school. She helped us a lot in buying experiment materials.
Thanks to our college, Tongji University, they gave us enough funding to start our project.
Technique support
Thanks to Li Wu and Xiang Ding for helping us solve the problem in the plasmids construction and behavioral test separately. Both of them were very patient in teaching us not only usages but also strategies.
Human practice support
Thanks to Fablab Shanghai from Tongji Design & Innovation Institute for developing Biology & SynBio courses aiming at teenagers with our team. Their knowledge of machine manufacturing really help us make a simple biotool box demo. What’s more, they provide us a great community and school platform to put our courses into practice.
Presentation coach
Professor Chao Zhang and professor Jing Zhang helped us on presentation coaching. Thanks for their patient instructions.
Multimedia support
Thanks Qingyan Zeng for dubbing for our brief introduction video.
Material support
Last but not least, in our project, we used some other labs’ plasmids and materials. Here we want to show our sincere thanks to Chunyang Ni (SYSU, UTSW) and 2017 XMU iGEM team. Thanks for your kindness!
