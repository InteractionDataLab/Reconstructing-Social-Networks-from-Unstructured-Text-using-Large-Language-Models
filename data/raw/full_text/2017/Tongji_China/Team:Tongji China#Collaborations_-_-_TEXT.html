Mutual Help
Although some unexpected difficulties arose in the course of our experiment, mutual help among teams can help us get through. We got help from other iGEM teams and professors and overcame the difficulties, we also gave a helping hand to iGEM teams in need of our assistance.
We were extremely fortunate to become friends with the Xiamen University (XMU) iGEM team, they were very generous and gave us plasmids E0020,E0040 and E0010 which we were looking for in our previous preparatory project.
This is Shandong University (SDU) 's first time to participate in iGEM, and Tongji has already participated in 3 years. We shared information on team managementï¼Œthe iGEM requirements and what iGEM really is. In the process we became very good friends.
This year SDU's project focuses on the treatment of tumors by replacing the mutated p53. The 2016 Tongji iGEM team also focused on cancer therapy with some parts containing p53. Therefore SDU team asked us for BBa_K1922003(wt p53) and BBa_K1922006(htERT-p53) for their experiments. We shared what we know and our experiences using p53 in experiments. We sent two samples fugw vector and htERT-GFP plasmid containing htERT promoter in them.
We checked the samples carefully and wrote instructions in order to make their work easier. Some of the information are as follows:

Conference of China iGEMer Community
This summer we took part in the 4th CCiC which was held by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. iGEM has been in China for ten years, and many of the first iGEM contestants have become excellent synthetic biologists. Some of them came to the conference to share their iGEM and scientific research experience. CCiC Organizing Committee set up speeches, posters exhibitions, academic salons, panel sessions and other different activities, the atmosphere is really great. Here we also had the opportunity to talk face to face with King L. Chow and Kenneth Oye from the iGEM Headquaters. At the meeting we showcased our project: Ignis Fly, and shared not only just our project itself, but the opinions about SynBio and biology researches with the other teams.
What an amazing experience!
2nd Open Night Live
The 2nd Open Night Live also called Tongji iGEM x Fablab Shanghai Open Night. It was held to showcase the iGEM teams in Shanghai and to give people an opportunity to exchange ideas with different iGEM team members. It has been an honor for us to invite Fudan, Fudan_China, Shanghaitech, STJU_BioX_Shanghai and ECUST to our Open Night Live.
We were delighted to find out that there were many college students watching and expressing views. Some of them also made a few suggestions on what more our project could do, and we added the parts we thought were reasonable. There was a symposium among iGEM teams after the Open Night Live where we exchanged ideas. We also set up a live webcast and gave Open Night Live to iGEM teams in other areas. It's really an unforgettable experience that we meet members of other iGEM team directly and interact together with more iGEM teams on the internet!
