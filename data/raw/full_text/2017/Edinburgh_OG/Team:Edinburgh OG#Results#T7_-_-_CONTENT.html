Band sizes were not as predicted, indicating that the insert is incorrect.</P></DIV><P>In the colony 1 sequences, both the forward and reverse aligned well with the T7 flanks, and the first half of the protospacer construct. However, a large gap in alignment was seen spanning from the end of protospacer 2 to the end of protospacer 4 (Figure
		2). It is unclear what could cause what seems like a precise excision of half of the <EM>vanA</EM> sequences. Chromatogram peaks were unambiguous so sequencing issues are unlikely.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width:500px;"><P><STRONG>Figure 2: </STRONG>Colony 1 sequences indicated a loss of two protospacers from the construct.

The forward sequence aligned to a short sequence prior to the insert, then contained a large gap in alignment followed by a very weak alignment to the 3’
		end of the 3’ flank. It is unclear what could have caused such massive discrepancy between the expected and obtained sequences. Chromatogram peaks were significantly smaller and less clear than with colony 1, so it is possible that the discrepancy
		is at least partially due to sequencing issues.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width:500px;"><P><STRONG>Figure 3:</STRONG> The colony 2 reverse sequence showed no alignment to the template.

Several attempts were made to ligate the spacers into the pCas9 plasmid - using simultaneously phosphorylated, separately
		phosphorylated and unphosphorylated spacer oligo pairs. In all cases, transformation into <EM>E. coli</EM> resulted in no colonies on chloramphenicol selection plates. The chloramphenicol plates, ligation protocol, and BL21 DE3 cells were successfully
		used in other experiments by the team, so these are unlikely to be the source of the problem. The spacers were only 25bp in length, so it is possible that their small size prevented successful ligation.</P><P>Due to the lack of successful production of the CRISPR selection system, no work was done on the T7 phages themselves.</P><H1 class="subtitle text-center">Want more results?</H1></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
