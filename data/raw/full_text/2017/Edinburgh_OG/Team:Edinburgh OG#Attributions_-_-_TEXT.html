We are incredibly grateful to everyone who provided us with help and advice during our project. We couldn’t have done it without you - thank you very much!
Original Work
The project was based on work carried out by Ido Yosef, Miriam Manor, Ruth Kiro and Udi Qimron, described in their 2015 paper “Temperate and lytic bacteriophages programmed to sensitise and kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria”.

Team PhagED
Filippo Abbondanza: responsible for engineering the lambda lysogenic phage to contain a CRISPR system to target resistance gene fragments.
Erin Corbett: responsible for engineering E. coli to create the mock pathogen testing platform, and for developing the T7 lytic phage.
Yunqi He: responsible for engineering the P1 lysogenic phage to contain a CRISPR system to target resistance gene fragments.
Ti He: responsible for engineering the lambda lysogenic phage to contain a CRISPR system to target resistance gene fragments..
Lydia Mapstone: responsible for engineering E. coli to create the mock pathogen testing platform, and for engineering the T4 lytic phage using BRED (Bacteriophage Recombineering of Electroporated DNA).
Yuri Matsueda: responsible for engineering the P1 lysogenic phage to contain a CRISPR system to target resistance gene fragments.
Anton Puzorjov: responsible for building a model of bacteria-phage interactions, combining both lytic and lysogenic phages.
Yating Wang: engineering the P1 lysogenic phage to contain a CRISPR system to target resistance gene fragments.
Owen Yeung: responsible for engineering the lambda lysogenic phage to contain a CRISPR system to target resistance gene fragments.
The Edinburgh_OG team members developed the iGEM project as part of our Masters dissertations at the University of Edinburgh. Due to academic requirements, the iGEM project, PhagED, was divided into individual sub-projects to allow the production of unique dissertations. Each of us completed a dissertation based on the work we did for iGEM, and these dissertations are available upon request.
