The MoClo cells possess the target sequence of the CRISPR system on a KanR plasmid. On the contrary, the SaCas9/FnCpf1
		system is on the ChlrR P1 phagemid. Therefore, if cleavage by the endonucleases occurs, it results in the loss of Kanamycin resistance gene in the host cell, while in the acquisition of Chloramphenicol resistance. In both scenarios in which the endonucleases
		work or donâ€™t work, the MoClo cells will possess ChlrR as the result of the phage infection.</P><P>To test it, from the Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol plates (Figure 1 Step 1), several colonies were picked, and each colony was directly inoculated onto new LB plates (with Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin, and no antibiotics) (Figure 1 Step 2). The efficiency
		of the CRISPR system was verified by the presence of colonies when the colonies were moved from a Chloramphenicol plate to a Kanamycin plate. If these colonies do not grow on Kanamycin plates, we can assess that the cleavage of the target sequence by
		endonucleases occurred, leading to the loss of the KanR MoClo plasmid. Instead, the efficiency of the phage infection was assessed by counting the colonies on the Chlr plate.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width:100%"><P><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> Strategy to verify the efficiency of the SaCas9 system and phage infection.</P></DIV><H2>Efficiency of SaCas9 system</H2><P>To investigate the efficiency of the SaCas9 system to cleave the target sequence, colonies were picked from Chloramphenicol plates and inoculated onto Kanamycin plates (Figure 1 Step 2). Colonies 1-4 came from KPC MoClo cells infected by P1-SaCas9-KPC
		spacer, while colonies 5-8 were VanA MoClo cells infected with P1-SaCas9-vanA spacer. In addition, colonies from KPC and VanA MoClo cells infected by the negative control phage (no spacers) were also picked (A-D for KPC MoClo cells, E-H for VanA MoClo
		cells). The result is shown in Table 1. The pictures of plates are available in Figure 2.</P><P>The SaCas9 system targeting the KanR plasmid within VanA MoClo cells showed promising - albeit not consistent - results. Among colonies 5-8 from the Chloramphenicol plate, colony 6 did not grow on the Kanamycin plate indicating that the SaCas9 might
		have cleaved the target KanR plasmid. However, the experiment was performed only once and further replicates to confirm the efficiency of the SaCas9 should be tested.</P><P>On the contrary, survival of the KPC MoClo cells on the Kanamycin plates implied that none of the plasmid with <EM>bla</EM><EM>kpc</EM> target sequences and the Kanamycin resistance gene were cleaved. This may be due to an error in the spacer design,
		as SaCas9 cassettes are identical between ones targeting <EM>bla</EM><EM>KPC</EM> and ones for VanA.</P><P>Despite these results, three colonies which was infected by negative control phage did not grow on Kanamycin plates. This might imply that KanR plasmid has been lost from the MoClo cells due to unknown mechanism. Further repetitive experiments are needed,
		to make sure that our SaCas9 is functional.</P><H2>Efficiency of phage infection</H2><P>The efficiency of phage infection suggested to be low (Table 1). This is because the colonies 9-16 from Kanamycin plates did not grow on Chloramphenicol plates, thus not hindering the P1 phagemid. Quantitative analysis on the number of phage in solution
		could have been done for more precise results.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width:800px;"><P><STRONG>Table 1:</STRONG> Verification of efficiency of the CRISPR SaCas9 system and phage infection.
