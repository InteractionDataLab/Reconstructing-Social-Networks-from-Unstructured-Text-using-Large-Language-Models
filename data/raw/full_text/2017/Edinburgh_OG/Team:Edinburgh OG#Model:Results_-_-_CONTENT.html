The list of interactions is described as follows: the initial population of susceptible bacteria (<EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>S</EM></SUB>) are
		infected with a population of temperate phage (<EM>P</EM><EM>T</EM>) at time <EM>t=0</EM>. Bacteria that are get infected with this phage form a new population of lysogenic bacteria (<EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>L</EM></SUB>). These bacteria obtain protection
		from a lytic phage (<EM>P</EM>) and can pass it to their daughter cells upon division. Upon induction at rate <EM>q</EM> lysogenic bacteria enter the lytic cycle, which leads to the production of viral particles and cell burst after the <EM>time latency </EM>(<EM>T</EM>)
		has passed. After some time (<EM>ε</EM>), the lytic phage is added into the system. Lytic phage can also infect susceptible bacteria and form a new population of infected bacteria (<EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>I</EM></SUB>). After the time latency has
		passed, infected bacteria burst open releasing <EM>b </EM>phage particles that can then repeat the cycle. Lytic phage can also infect a population of lysogenic bacteria, however upon entering the cell, phage genome gets destroyed by the CRISPR-Cas9
		system delivered by the temperate phage. Similarly, a temperate phage can infect a lytically infected bacteria before it gets burst, however this has no effect on the bacteria as will be discussed further (Figure 1).</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width: 600px;"><P><STRONG>Figure 1</STRONG>.

		between induction and lysis using DDEs as described in Levin <EM>et al.</EM> (2007).</P><P>The population of lytic phages increases as lytically infected bacterial cells <EM>T</EM> time ago lyse, releasing the phages. The population of lytic phage can infect all populations of bacteria, of which only <EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>S</EM></SUB> will result
		in an outcome by rendering cells into <EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>I</EM></SUB>. To highlight the essence of the proposed two-phage strategy, upon infection of lysogenic bacteria with a lytic phage, the CRISPR-Cas9 system inside lysogenic bacteria cuts the lytic
		phage genome, thereby protecting the bacteria from its viral genes.</P><P>The population of lysogenic phage increases proportionally to the induction rate and the concentration of lysogenic bacteria that were induced <EM>T</EM><SUB><EM>T</EM></SUB> time ago.

		we argue that upon superinfection of <EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>I</EM></SUB> with <EM>P</EM><EM>T</EM>, in most cases there will not be enough time for the temperate phage genes, including CRISPR-Cas9 system, to be translated and produce a significant enough

The final system of DDEs is as follows:</P><P>One of the key questions for the two-phage re-sensitation approach is to define the time when the population of antibiotic resistant bacteria, here referred as <EM>susceptible bacteria</EM>, goes extinct. Therefore, in all simulations we drew a particular
		attention to the time at which the concentration of <EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>S</EM></SUB> goes below 10-15 particles/ml as explained in <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh_OG/Model:Methodology">Methodology</A>. In addition, we calculated the ratio
		of average concentration of lytically infected bacteria to the average concentration of susceptible bacteria (<EM>r</EM>) also as described in <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh_OG/Model:Methodology">Methodology</A>.</P><P>In order to see how inclusion of the re-infection and superinfection affects the time of extinction of <EM>X</EM><SUB><EM>S</EM></SUB>, in Figure 4 we simulated a full model and variations with and without these two processes. It is clear that with the
		inclusion of the superinfection has little or no impact on the extinction time (Figure 4A and C). Whereas exclusion of the re-infection process from the model results in decreased extinction time. Although from these simulations it might be suggested
		to exclude the superinfection from the final model for the further simulations, we decided to leave due to the following reasons: (1) the absence of a noticeable effect of superinfection might be just a result of the simulation with a given set of initial
		parameters and might change together with the parameters. (2) we could not find any previous studies of phage and bacteria models with either superinfection or re-infection included into the process, so it is an opportunity to present a new data here.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width: 800px;"><P><STRONG>Figure 4.</STRONG> Simulations of final batch models with parameters mentioned in Table 1.

Although the variation of this parameter in the continuous model showed no impact on the extinction time, we expected to see the difference in the
		batch model. Interestingly, the batch model also showed little variation in the output up if the phage is added at any time up until 9 hours after the start of the simulation (Figure 5). Figure 5D shows that introduction of the phage at 9 hours sharp
		results in the lowest extinction time (10 hours). However, from the same plot it is also seen that the population of lysogenic bacteria levels off at the concentration around 10-3 particles/ml, which should not happen due to constant lysis of these
		cells.

		Table 1. Similarly, there was no difference in the parameters of all three populations of bacteria: susceptible, lytically infected and lysogenic. Biologically, it is unlikely that all of these parameters will be the same across different populations

Therefore, the initial model of the batch process was extended to take allow variation in all 20 parameters.</P><P>We then performed a local sensitivity analysis using the expanded model, each parameter was changed from its nominal value (Table 1) by either subtracting 50% of the nominal value to obtain the minimal value or by adding 50% to obtain the maximal value.

To better represent the relative elasticity values of different

One per cent increase in <EM>Ki</EM> will result in 39.75% increase in <EM>r</EM>-value, meaning the proportion of lytically infected cells
		will increase dramatically. The main rationale behind the <EM>r</EM>-value is to quantify the selective pressure that a lytic phage is exerting onto the bacteria. The higher the <EM>r</EM>-value, the larger the proportion of susceptible bacteria that
		gets infected with the lytic phage and dies due to lysis. Therefore, one has to be careful whenever trying to manipulate the output variable, such as the extinction time of XS, as an undesirable side effect might result in a significant increase in
		the selective pressure thereby raising the risk of development of the resistance to the phage in bacteria.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width: 800px;"><P><STRONG>Figure 6.</STRONG> Spider diagram of the sensitivity analysis results.

Only parameters with absolute elasticities over 0.01 are shown.</P></DIV><P>Based on the data from Table 2 we selected five parameters that either had significant elasticity of the extinction time or a low PCC to study their change and relationships with the output values in more details: the burst size of both phages (<EM>b</EM>,
		<EM>b</EM><EM>T</EM>), induction rate (<EM>q</EM>), time latency of a temperate phage (<EM>T</EM><SUB><EM>T</EM></SUB>) and the initial concentration of the lytic phage (<EM>P</EM><SUB><EM>0</EM></SUB>).</P><P>The results of the sensitivity analysis of separate parameters are simulated in Figure 7. It shows that the relationship between the induction rate and the extinction time is non-linear. This result was not obvious from the PCC value in Table 2, since
		the percentage change of the nominal value of 0.35 only analysed the lower end of the curve displayed in Figure 7A. The relationship between the time latency of a temperate phage and the extinction time is also non-linear and shows an obvious minimum
		extremum of around 0.5 hours at which the extinction time takes the lowest value (Figure 7B). The burst size of a temperate phage is shows a more linear relationship with the extinction time compared to the burst size of a lytic phage, yet the latter
		has a much larger elasticity of the r-ratio, confirming its importance in spreading the infection to other cells (Figure 7C and D). There is nearly a linear relationship between the initial concentration of the lytic particles and the extinction time
		and <EM>r</EM>-value. It is worthy noting that this parameter can be easily manipulated by the experimenter, so its influence on the selective pressure has to be always taken into account.</P><P>In addition to the five pre-selected parameters, we also simulated the the variability in the time when the lytic phage is added into the system (Figure 7F). The plot shows that the extinction time is independent from the time of introduction up until
		9 hours after the start of the simulation. Although this result matches the one we obtained previously (Figure 5), the pattern of the plot and unexpectedly round number suggest a numerical error during the simulation. So far we were unable to identify
		the source of this issue, however we suspect it originates from the PyDDE algorithm for solving DDEs.</P><DIV class="div-fig" style="width: 800px;"><P><STRONG>Figure 7. </STRONG>Sensitivity and relationship analysis of the separate parameters.

Most of these attempts failed at the attempt to interpret or replicate a limited number of previous papers that require a much better knowledge of mathematics,
