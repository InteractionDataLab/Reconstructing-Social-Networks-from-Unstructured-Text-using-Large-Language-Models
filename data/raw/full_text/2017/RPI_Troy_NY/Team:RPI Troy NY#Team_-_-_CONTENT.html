The inaugural RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) iGEM team comprises 11 undergraduates. Our team has benefited from the guidance of two professors in addition to other advisors. We are the first official team from RPI to successfully participate in iGEM, and we are excited and grateful for the opportunity to compete. Our team plans to realize the iGEM vision of advancing the state of the art in synthetic biology to improve health and generate knowledge. Our proposed work is highly interdisciplinary in that our project will feature several fields of inquiry including genetics, synthesis and identification of molecules, assessment of biological properties through cell based assays, and metabolic pathway engineering. Following a summer and fall of interdisciplinary collaboration to carry out an innovative synthetic biology project, we plan to present our work at iGEM. Our team members come from many different areas of science and engineering and have diverse skill sets in cellular biology, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and metabolic/enzyme engineering. We've been doing our best thus far, and look forward to meeting the other teams at the Giant Jamboree in November!</FONT></FONT></P></DIV><DIV class="column full_size"><CENTER><FONT face="Century Gothic"><FONT size="5"><H5>Team Members</H5></FONT></FONT></CENTER></DIV><TABLE align="center" height="200px"><TBODY><TR><TD><P style="width:850px"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size="3"> Name: Krystyna Farrell  Class Year: 2018  Major: Chemical Engineering  Hi! My name is Krystyna and I’m a Chemical Engineering major with a strong interest in molecular biology and genetics. In addition to my involvement in iGEM, I work at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and hold officer positions in RPI’s Red &amp; White Student Organization and Alpha Phi. My greatest passion of all however, has been research in the Koffas metabolic engineering lab over the past two years. CRISPR systems fascinate me and I’m looking to pursue a PhD in Biological Engineering at another institution after earning my Bachelor’s degree from RPI in May. </FONT></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE align="center" height="200px"><TBODY><TR><TD><P style="width:850px"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size="3"> Name: Ian Fralen  Class Year: 2018  Major: Business and Management  Hey! I’m Ian, a Senior Management student with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship. With a passion for science and a drive to use my schooling and knowledge to build upon something bigger than myself, I found massive opportunity for growth within iGEM. Much of my free time is spent playing on the RPI rugby team, weightlifting, playing guitar, working on business ventures, or spending time with my friends. Additionally, I am a proud brother of Phi Sigma Kappa and am an aspiring business owner. </FONT></FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE align="center" height="200px"><TBODY><TR><TD><P style="width:850px"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size="3"> Name: Megan Gupta  Class Year: 2019  Major: Biology  Hi! My name is Megan and I am a junior at RPI studying in the Accelerated Physician-Scientist Program. I joined iGEM because I have a strong interest in laboratory science and I believe in learning beyond the classroom to make a difference in our world. In my free time (as little as it is), I like reading, watching TV, and hanging out with friends. Megan Gupta I have been a part of iGEM since June 2017 as part of the Culturing and Chemistry Committee, specifically to work on chemical extraction of the sophorolipids, as I have a strong background in organic chemistry. I also am one of the two members working on the team Wiki, and have been regularly attending team meetings.
