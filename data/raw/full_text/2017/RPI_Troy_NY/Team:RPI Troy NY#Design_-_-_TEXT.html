Design
In this project, we sought to increase the production of sophorolipids by taking a two-part approach. In the first part, we engineered primers and inserted these into the yeast to be able to produce either normal amounts of sophorolipids or lesser amounts of sophorolipids (gene knockout). In the second part, we extracted these sophorolipids and completed analysis on this.
