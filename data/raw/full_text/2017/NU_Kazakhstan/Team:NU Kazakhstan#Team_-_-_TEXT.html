TEAM MEMBERS
Valdemir Kim
Bachelor of biological sciences, 4th year
Valdemir constructs parts and sequences like a boss. When he sends emails to us requesting us to check what he constructed, nobody replies because we don’t know how to improve that even more!
Mariyam Akizhanova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 4th year
Mariyam is like a mitochondria. When she spots the one, who is not working properly, she gives motivation (ATP) to work with her look “Be productive if you wanna live”.
Yerkezhan Kalikanova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 4th year
“Yerkezhan” equals “calm”. She is tranquil even if the experiment is failed and it has to be done several times again and again. Outside of iGEM, she enjoys contemporary dance.
Kymbat Mukhtarova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 4th year
Kymbat is miss productivity but only after she takes enough sleep. You do group work with her? Start without her, anyway she is sleeping. But when she comes, she does twice the work you have done when she was absent.
Sultan Mussakhan
Master of biological sciences, 1st year
Sultan is the master of troubleshooting in our team. If something went wrong, he sits for several hours surfing internet and gives the reasonable solution to the problem. If you hear someone cursing out loud, it is either him, or his supervisor.
Aigerim Abdimanova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 3rd year
Meet Aigerim! We call her “Angry girl”. Ask for a favour and she will always help you. The price for asking a help is to endure her anger.
Zhassulan Ispolov
Bachelor of biological sciences, 3rd year
Zhassulan is a professional cyber sportsman of our team. Well, at least he calls himself like that.
Almira Zhantuyakova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 3rd year
Almira is a junior at Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan. She is majoring in Biology. After graduation, Almira plans to pursue a MD. Outside of her research, she enjoys cooking.
Nikhola Mirashirova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 3rd year
In the laboratory, Nikhola loves to write everything down what she is doing. Ask her what have we been doing on 6th of July at 9:37 am, she can look it up in her notebook. We planned our agenda by her notes.
Saniya Aitmaganbetova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 3rd year
Saniya is one of the sporty members of the team. She is so in love with biology that she even has a tattoo in the form of DNA!
Daulet Aitymbayev
Bachelor of biological sciences, 2nd year
Daulet is a sophomore student that likes to make everybody happy with his catchy phrases. There are rumors that he is a magic unicorn that came from another universe.© Daulet
In his leisure time, he usually plays guitar.
Lyazzat Bekish
Bachelor of biological sciences, 2nd year
Lyazzat is ready to work all night long when necessary. The next day, she is not in the lab by minding her “business”. We always see through her. You wonder how? God bless instagram! One interesting thing to note is that she is keen on art and sport besides iGEM.
Yersultan Mirasbekov
Bachelor of biological sciences, 2nd year
If you read about Daulet, Yersultan is exactly the opposite of him. He always tries to make somebody (Aigerim) unhappy :(. However, he is optimistic about everything and does heavy mechanical work in the laboratory.
Assel Mukhanova
Bachelor of biological sciences, 2nd year
Assel is very accurate and able to do almost everything but at an easy pace .If you requested her to do something, oh boy, be ready to wait.
