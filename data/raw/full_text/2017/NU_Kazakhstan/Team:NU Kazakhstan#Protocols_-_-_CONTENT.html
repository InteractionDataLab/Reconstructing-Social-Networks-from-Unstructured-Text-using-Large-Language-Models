If the antibody is diluted in TBST-BSA, you will have to wash 3X in TBST for 5 min each before adding antibody.</LI><LI>You should add enough primary antibody to just cover the gel. Very gently rotate the blot in primary antibody in PMT for 1 hr at room temperature. Make sure that during the shaking the liquid is continuously covering all of the blot: if you rotate it too quickly you can create a situation where the liquid is not circulating over the center of the blot --- this is bad. (Usually you can save the primary antibody after use and use it several times. In fact, it often gets better [cleaner] with extended use. Store the diluted antibody/milk solution at -20 degrees)</LI><LI>Remove primary antibody. Wash the blot by shaking in an excess of TMT for 5 min. Repeat 4 times, i.e., 5X 5-min washes; in other words, these washing steps should take about 25-30 min</LI><LI>Remove and discard the final wash solution, and add the secondary antibody. Slowly shake membrane in diluted secondary antibody for at least 1 hr. For goat anti-rabbit HRP, use 1:10,000-20,000 for Pierce reagent, i.e., 1uL in 10 mL or 20 mL of TMT. Make the dilution by first pouring the given volume of TMT (e.g., 10-20 mL) into a plastic tube, then add the secondary antibody, mix by inverting a few times and pour onto the nitrocellulose. Note, the dilution of the secondary varies for each primary antibody and the detection reagents that are used, and often must be determined experimentally</LI><LI>Remove and discard the secondary antibody. Wash the blot in TBS-Tween for 4 washes for 10 min each</LI><LI>Wash in 1X TBS for 2 washes for 5 min each</LI><LI>Leave blot in TBS until ready to expose to substrate. To prepare for the addition of substrate, lift the nitrocellulose with forceps to drain excess TBS (but do not dry) and put onto Saran wrap with protein side up</LI><LI>Prepare Pierce’s SuperSignal (Pierce SuperSignal WestDura Extended Substrate) just before you are ready to probe the blot. For each substrate, add an equal amount of reagent 1 and 2 to a 15 mL snap top tube and mix gently (for a small blot, use 0.5-1 mL of each reagent, i.e., 1-2 mL total should be sufficient to cover blot)</LI><LI>Slowly pour the substrate solution onto the nitrocellulose membrane (protein side up). Leave on for 5 min (Pierce). While the substrate solution is on the membrane be sure to gently and carefully move the saran wrap so that the substrate continuously and fully moves across the membrane. To avoid any darkroom conflicts, it is usually a good idea to do the substrate addition in the darkroom, so that you will have ready access to the exposure and developing facilities. That is, take your blot upstairs in TBS, do the substrate addition in the darkroom, and then do your exposures</LI><LI>After incubating with the substrate for 5 min, use forceps to lift blot, allow the excess substrate to drain, and place the blot onto a new piece of saran wrap. Place the protein side face down onto a smooth surface of saran wrap. Package the membrane by closing saran wrap on back</LI><LI>Place the blot protein side up in a film cassette, close cassette tightly and expose to film. (Note: do not expose with white radiation enhancing screens in the cassette. These will cause fogging of the film especially on long Western blotting exposures.) The time of exposure will vary depending on the antibody, the abundance of the given protein, the amount of extract used, etc. To save time and film, it is advisable to perform multiple exposures on a single piece of film; this is done by moving the nitrocellulose membrane to a fresh part of the film and allowing to “expose” for varying lengths of time. One can usually get 6 exposures of a small filter per 8 x 10 inch piece of X-ray film. For example, to do 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120 sec exposures. You can cut the film in half if you only want to do 2-3 exposures, but do not cut the film smaller than this. If using a new antibody, and you do not know how long to expose the blot, a five minute exposure is usually sufficient to determine if you need to expose it longer or five minutes is too long. If you can see your proteins “glowing” in the dark room on the membrane, 1-10 second exposures should be sufficient.</LI></OL><P>**The incubation times that are indicated above are the minimum times (i.e. you can leave the primary antibody incubation at 4 degrees overnight).
It is advisable NOT to leave the secondary overnight, as that might increase the background
