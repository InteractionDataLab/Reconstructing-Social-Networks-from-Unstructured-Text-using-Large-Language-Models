May
This month was used for preparation of all equipment, media and reagents that can be necessary for realisation of the project. Also, in May newly recruited and future members of iGEM team acquired skills in basic techniques of biotechnology. The plan of the activities and protocols was worked out in order to keep the big picture of the process and organise the work of all part of the project.

In June we focused on collection of the stock DNA which could be used further in electroporations.

At the same time, we used June to develop a biosafety system SuperNova for our project.

Plasmid DNA collection stage proceeded to transformation of C. reinhardtii stage. The Miniprep plasmid extraction procedure was optimized to the Miraprep protocol which appeared to be very efficient in its plasmid DNA concentrations. We tested pHYG3 and pJD67 plasmids in electroporations of algae which gave green colonies and resistance on the selective media. But the main part was still awaiting as the ChrR+Chromodulin genes were still to come.
