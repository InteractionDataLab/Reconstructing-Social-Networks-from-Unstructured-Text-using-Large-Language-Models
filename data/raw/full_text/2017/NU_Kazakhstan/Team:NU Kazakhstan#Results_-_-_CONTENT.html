The final results were obtained in the very last days.

There were three controls in the experiment: strains without chromium (background correction), Sodium acetate with chromium and NADH with chromium.

Chromate reduction assay performed by use of two strains of algae C.reinhardtii, namely with cell wall (cw+) and without (cw-).  The measurement of Cr(VI) concentration as a period of time was conducted according to 1,5-DPC method described in Chromate reduction assay protocol. Non-electroporated algae samples (without Chromate Reductase) and electroporated algae (with Chromium reductase) were used. NADH substrate for chromium reductase was tested as well. 

As it can be seen from the graphs 1 and 2, the natural ability of ability of C.reinhardtii to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was observed. However, there is a noticeable increase in reduced ability of electroporated samples of cw+ strains (almost two-fold decrease in hexavalent chromium) due to the presence of the recombinant protein - chromium reductase. </P><CENTER>Graph 1. Reduction of Cr(VI) as a period of time by CW+ C.reinhardtii strain in the presence of NADH.</CENTER><CENTER>Graph 2. Reduction of Cr(VI) as a period of time by CW+ C.reinhardtii strain in the absence of NADH.</CENTER><P>Considering the reduction of hexavalent chromium in the electroporated cw- stains from graphs 3 and 4, it is possible to say that while in graph 3 there was approximately 20% decrease in Cr (VI) concentration, in the graph 4 - about 12%. It could be proposed that the addition of NADH influenced the reduction ability of the cw- strain. Reduction ability of electroporated CW- strains upon the addition of NADH was not as dramatic as in the electroporated cw+ strains. The natural ability of cw- strains to reduce Cr (VI) upon the addition of NADH constituted much higher reduction as compared to the NADH- control. It could be suggested that this happened due the influence of the NADH in the mutant strain of C.reinhardtii. </P><CENTER>Graph 3. Reduction of Cr(VI) as a period of time by CW- C.reinhardtii strain in the presence of NADH.
</CENTER><CENTER>Graph 4. Reduction of Cr(VI) as a period of time by CW- C.reinhardtii strain in the absence of NADH.</CENTER><P>In the graph 3, it can be observed that experiment with CW- (NADH+) was done improperly due to human error, because reduction ability of electroporated and non-electroporated cells are almost the same.

Overall, according to the results of the experiment, it was observed that the presence of Chromate Reductase substantially improved the efficiency of hexavalent chromium reduction for C. reinhardtii.</P><B>We have experimentally proven that the part central to our project works as expected.</B></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 col-md-pull-8 left-sidebar" id="fh5co-sidebar"><DIV class="sidebar-box animate-box"><H3 class="sidebar-heading">Results</H3><UL class="sidebar-links"><LI><A id="intr_sb" href="#">Vector Construction</A></LI><LI><A id="rp_sb" href="#">I.
