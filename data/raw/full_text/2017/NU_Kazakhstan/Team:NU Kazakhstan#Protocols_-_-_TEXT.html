SUBCULTURE OF ALGAE
Resuspend and take 100μL of algae from the old solution of TAP+arg
Place into fresh 50 mL TAP+arg
Check OD at 750nm
AGAR WASH
Put 15 g of Agar (SIGMA-ALDRICH) in 2 L Erlenmeyer flask and fill up with 1.5 L of dH2O
Put in magnetic stirrer rod and place on magnetic plate
Wait for 3 hours
Take Buchner funnel and place a filter paper on it
Attach it to vacuum filtering flask, turn on vacuum pump and seal filter paper on the surface of Buchner funnel (pour a little bit of dH2O)
After vigorous swirling pour about 250 mL of agar with water in the Buchner funnel
After several minutes, agar will dry a little bit on filter paper
Take it out from  the funnel very accurately and place on the dish
Discard all liquid from vacuum filtering flask into the rack
Repeat steps 6-9 until all agar is filtered
Carefully take all dried agar from filter papers back into washed  2 L Erlenmeyer flask
Fill it with dH2O again
Repeat 7 washes with dH2O, 1 wash with 10% bleach, 1 wash with 70% ethanol and 1 final wash with dH2O. Total 10 washes

CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATION
was carried out according to IGEM Protocols
Resuspend DNA in selected wells in the Distribution Kit with 10µl dH20. Pipet up and down several times, let sit for a few minutes. Resuspension will be red from cresol red dye
Label 1.5ml tubes with part name or well location. Fill lab ice bucket with ice, and pre-chill 1.5ml tubes (one tube for each transformation, including your control) in a floating foam tube rack
Pipette 50µl of competent cells into 1.5ml tube: 50µl in a 1.5ml tube per transformation. Tubes should be labeled, pre-chilled, and in a floating tube rack for support. Keep all tubes on ice. Don’t forget a 1.5ml tube for your control
Pipette 1µl of resuspended DNA into 1.5ml tube: Pipette from well into appropriately labeled tube. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice
Pipette 1µl of control DNA into 2ml tube: Pipette 1µl of 10pg/µl control into your control transformation. Gently pipette up and down a few times. Keep all tubes on ice
Close 1.5ml tubes, incubate on ice for 30min: Tubes may be gently agitated/flicked to mix solution, but return to ice immediately
Heat shock tubes at 42°C for 45 sec: 1.5ml tubes should be in a floating foam tube rack. Place in water bath to ensure the bottoms of the tubes are submerged. Timing is critical
Incubate on ice for 5min: Return transformation tubes to ice bucket
Pipette 950µl SOC media to each transformation: SOC should be stored at 4°C, but can be warmed to room temperature before use. Check for contamination
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hours, shaking at 200-300rpm
Pipette 100µL of each transformation onto petri plates Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony
Spin down cells at 6800g for 3mins and discard 800µL of the supernatant. Resuspend the cells in the remaining 100µL, and pipette each transformation onto petri plates Spread with sterilized spreader or glass beads immediately. This increases the chance of getting colonies from lower concentration DNA samples
Incubate transformations overnight (14-18hr) at 37°C: Incubate the plates upside down (agar side up). If incubated for too long, colonies may overgrow and the antibiotics may start to break down; un-transformed cells will begin to grow

https://www.neb.com/protocols/1/01/01/taq-dna-polymerase-with-standard-taq-buffer-m0273
CPEC
was conducted in accordance to Quan & Tian, 2011, “Circular polymerase extension cloning for high-throughput cloning of complex and combinatorial DNA libraries”
http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v6/n2/full/nprot.2010.181.html
Colony PCR
Carried out by NEB protocols for Phusion Master Mix solution what we found as the best possible protocol for colony PCR. The general protocol is here.
https://www.neb.com/protocols/2012/09/06/protocol-phusion-high-fidelity-pcr-master-mix-with-hf-buffer-m0531
However, we added some modifications in order to our protocol to increase the efficiency. Instead of using extracted DNA, we used a single colony, which was boiled for 10 min at 95C. Then, 1 uL of solution was used to set the general protocol. A single colony should be stirred rigorously and well (crucial point). In addition, we figured out the the addition of 3% DMSO is important to maximize the PCR.

The complete Western Blotting Protocol
Preparation of Total Cell Extracts by the AT Lysis Method
AT Buffer (final conc.)
Make up EDTA, EGTA, NaF, Na4P2O7, DTT as 10X stock, store at -20°C
Make up Hepes as 1 M stock, store at 4°C
Once made up, AT Buffer can be stored at -20°C indefinitely in small aliquots
Components marked * must be added freshly on day of use
To isolate cytosol only, try only 0.1% Triton X-100 and no glycerol
To prepare 100 mL of AT Buffer
To make extracts
Aspirate media from 100 mm (60 mm) plate of cells and wash cells 2 times with ice-cold PBS or TD. After the second wash, add 1 mL of 1X PBS (or TD), scrape cells gently with a rubber scraper, and collect in microcentrifuge tube. Add another 0.5 mL of ice-cold PBS (or TD) to the plate, rescrape and pool with the first 1 mL scraping
To collect cells, spin 3-4 min at about number 5 speed in microcentrifuge and aspirate as much of the PBS (or TD) as possible from the cell pellet when done
Add 160 uL of ice-cold AT buffer (or 100 ul for 60 mm dish)
Aspirate through a 27-gauge needle at least 5 times. Squirt liquid onto side of tube as you are aspirating up and down
Add 5 uL of 5 M NaCl (to a final conc. of 150 mM NaCl) (or 3.1 uL of 5 M NaCl if working with cells scraped from 60 mm dish)
Spin at top speed in microcentrifuge at 4°C for 30 min
Transfer supernatant to a new tube. At this point, extracts can be stored at - 80°C
Preparation of Cell Extract by SDS/boiling Lysis
Aspirate media from cells and wash cells 2 times with ice-cold TD buffer. Scrape off cells as above in about 1.5 mL of TD buffer (1 mL then 0.5 mL and then pool)
To collect cells, spin for 5 min at approximately #5 speed in microcentrifuge and aspirate to remove as much TD as possible from the cell pellet
Depending on the number of cells and the abundance of protein, add water, resuspend cells and then add an equal amount of 2X or 4X SDS sample buffer. For a 60 mm dish of cells, you may want to add about 100 uL of water and 100 uL of SDS sample buffer (and run about 10-20 uL on the gel after boiling)
Mix sample well, and boil sample for 10 min at 95-100°C
Extract is now ready for loading onto SDS gel or can be stored at -80°C (if stored frozen, reboil about 3 min before loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gel)
Protein Determination (OD 595)
Dilute Bio-Rad solution to 1X (It comes as a 5X stock) e.g., 2 mL of Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Concentrate Reagent + 8 mL of distilled water
Aliquot 1 mL of 1X Bio-Rad Protein Assay solution to microcentrifuge tubes. Of course, the number of centrifuge tubes depends on number of samples
Set up the Bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard using the BSA stocks from New England Biolabs: 100X BSA stock is equal to 10 ug/uL, and 10X BSA stock contains 1 ug/uL. Therefore, to the aliquoted 1X Bio-Rad solution, add 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 ug by adding the following amounts of a given BSA stock to each tube:
For your samples, you want the Bio-Rad solution to turn blue within about a minute after addition of extract. Usually, this will happen if you add 2-5 uL of each cell extract to 1X Bio-Rad solution, and then mix by vortexing briefly and leave at room temperature for one minute
When reaction has completed changing color, transfer 200 uL of reaction (i.e., either BSA standards or cell extracts) into a 96-well Falcon plate
Read OD at 595 nm
Find slope (ug/OD) of BSA standard, according to the following formula:  Slope = ug (0+1+2+5+10+15+20)/absorbance (OD0+OD1+OD2+OD5+...+OD20)
Multiply absorbance value of each cell extract sample by the calculated slope number (ug/OD). Divide that number by the volume of cell extract added to the 1X Bio-Rad solution (from step 4). Resulting value (ug/uL) is the protein concentration of cell extract. This will often be in the range of about 1-5 ug/uL
Depending on the level of expression of the protein of interest you may need to load different amounts of cell extract. However, a good starting point is to use about 20 ug of cell extract on SDS gel. (To determine volume needed, divide 20 ug by the protein concentration of cell extract)
SDS-PAGE
Assemble the glass plate sandwich
Prepare the resolving gel solution:
Pour the gel solution between the glass plates, leave about ¼ of the space free for the stacking gel
Carefully cover the top of the resolving gel with 50% isopropanol and wait until the resolving gel polymerizes (~30 min). A clear line will appear between the gel surface and the solution on top when polymerization is complete
Discard the isopropanol. Wash gently with double-distilled water
Prepare the stacking (upper gel):
Pour the stacking gel solution
Insert combs. Allow the gel to polymerize for at least 60 min
Remove combs carefully. Put the gel into the electrophoresis tank, fill the tank (bottom and top reservoirs) with fresh 1X Tris-glycine-SDS Buffer, make sure that the gel wells are covered with the buffer
Load protein ladder/marker and probes
Set an appropriate voltage and current depending on how many gels you run

*Wet Whatman paper and transfer apparatus sponges with 1X Transfer Buffer
Prepare the blot sandwich as follows:
Black side of transfer apparatus
Two sheets of Whatman 3 MM paper
Gel
Nitrocellulose membrane (nitrocellulose also needs to wetted for about 30 sec in 1X Transfer Buffer before putting against gel). When laying nitrocellulose on gel, be sure to lay out smoothly and with no bubbles (use a glass dowel). Wear gloves and handle nitrocellulose with forceps
Two sheets of Whatman 3 MM paper
White side of transfer apparatus.
Close apparatus tightly, and place in blotting apparatus. The nitrocellulose membrane should closest to the anode (red) part of the apparatus (for the cassette: Black to black - White to red).
For minigels, use the mini-transfer apparatus, and transfer at 160 milliamps for 60 min (for higher molecular weight proteins, transfer for 2.5 hrs at 200 mA in cold room)
Western Blotting with Pierce’s SuperSignal
Solutions Required:
25% Tween 20 [pour 10 mL of Tween 20 into a 50-mL falcon tube; add deionized water up to 40 mL]
1X TBS
1X TBS + 0.1% Tween
TMT: 1X TBST, 2% milk [100 mL: 5 g Carnation instant nonfat milk; TBST to 100 mL] Note: for some antisera, you will need to use 3% BSA-not milk-in the antibody dilution buffer)
Protocol:
Blocking Step: Immerse nitrocellulose in TMT and shake slowly on platform for 1 hr at room temperature (or overnight at 4 degrees)
Remove blocking solution and add diluted primary antibody. If the antibody is diluted in TBST-BSA, you will have to wash 3X in TBST for 5 min each before adding antibody.
You should add enough primary antibody to just cover the gel. Very gently rotate the blot in primary antibody in PMT for 1 hr at room temperature. Make sure that during the shaking the liquid is continuously covering all of the blot: if you rotate it too quickly you can create a situation where the liquid is not circulating over the center of the blot --- this is bad. (Usually you can save the primary antibody after use and use it several times. In fact, it often gets better [cleaner] with extended use. Store the diluted antibody/milk solution at -20 degrees)
Remove primary antibody. Wash the blot by shaking in an excess of TMT for 5 min. Repeat 4 times, i.e., 5X 5-min washes; in other words, these washing steps should take about 25-30 min
Remove and discard the final wash solution, and add the secondary antibody. Slowly shake membrane in diluted secondary antibody for at least 1 hr. For goat anti-rabbit HRP, use 1:10,000-20,000 for Pierce reagent, i.e., 1uL in 10 mL or 20 mL of TMT. Make the dilution by first pouring the given volume of TMT (e.g., 10-20 mL) into a plastic tube, then add the secondary antibody, mix by inverting a few times and pour onto the nitrocellulose. Note, the dilution of the secondary varies for each primary antibody and the detection reagents that are used, and often must be determined experimentally
Remove and discard the secondary antibody. Wash the blot in TBS-Tween for 4 washes for 10 min each
Wash in 1X TBS for 2 washes for 5 min each
Leave blot in TBS until ready to expose to substrate. To prepare for the addition of substrate, lift the nitrocellulose with forceps to drain excess TBS (but do not dry) and put onto Saran wrap with protein side up
Prepare Pierce’s SuperSignal (Pierce SuperSignal WestDura Extended Substrate) just before you are ready to probe the blot. For each substrate, add an equal amount of reagent 1 and 2 to a 15 mL snap top tube and mix gently (for a small blot, use 0.5-1 mL of each reagent, i.e., 1-2 mL total should be sufficient to cover blot)
Slowly pour the substrate solution onto the nitrocellulose membrane (protein side up). Leave on for 5 min (Pierce). While the substrate solution is on the membrane be sure to gently and carefully move the saran wrap so that the substrate continuously and fully moves across the membrane. To avoid any darkroom conflicts, it is usually a good idea to do the substrate addition in the darkroom, so that you will have ready access to the exposure and developing facilities. That is, take your blot upstairs in TBS, do the substrate addition in the darkroom, and then do your exposures
After incubating with the substrate for 5 min, use forceps to lift blot, allow the excess substrate to drain, and place the blot onto a new piece of saran wrap. Place the protein side face down onto a smooth surface of saran wrap. Package the membrane by closing saran wrap on back
Place the blot protein side up in a film cassette, close cassette tightly and expose to film. (Note: do not expose with white radiation enhancing screens in the cassette. These will cause fogging of the film especially on long Western blotting exposures.) The time of exposure will vary depending on the antibody, the abundance of the given protein, the amount of extract used, etc. To save time and film, it is advisable to perform multiple exposures on a single piece of film; this is done by moving the nitrocellulose membrane to a fresh part of the film and allowing to “expose” for varying lengths of time. One can usually get 6 exposures of a small filter per 8 x 10 inch piece of X-ray film. For example, to do 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120 sec exposures. You can cut the film in half if you only want to do 2-3 exposures, but do not cut the film smaller than this. If using a new antibody, and you do not know how long to expose the blot, a five minute exposure is usually sufficient to determine if you need to expose it longer or five minutes is too long. If you can see your proteins “glowing” in the dark room on the membrane, 1-10 second exposures should be sufficient.
**The incubation times that are indicated above are the minimum times (i.e. you can leave the primary antibody incubation at 4 degrees overnight).
It is advisable NOT to leave the secondary overnight, as that might increase the background

Stripping a Membrane and Reprobing with a Different Antibody
Make 100 mL of stripping buffer
Turn on the 55°C water bath and give it about 10-15 min to heat up
Pour out old stripping buffer from stripping container
Pour new stripping buffer into the container
Put nitrocellulose into the stripping buffer, seal the container, and put it into the 55°C water bath with a red weight on top
Incubate for 30 min
Wash 3X in TBS-Tween for 5 min each
Block with TMT for 1 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C
Proceed to Western blotting with the different primary antibody
When developing the blot, you may find that there is less signal on the blot, and so the best exposure may be significantly longer than expected. At times, 15-20 min of exposing to film is necessary to get a good signal on a reprobed Western blot.
