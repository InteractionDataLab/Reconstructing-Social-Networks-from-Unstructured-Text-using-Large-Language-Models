As an illustration, NU_Kazakhstan 2017 team used Varioskan LUX Multimode Microplate Reader to accomplish the InterLaboratory Study this year. The six different promoters (test device 1: BBa_J364000, test device 2: BBa_J364001, test device 3: BBa_J364002, test device 4: BBa_J364003, test device 5: BBa_J364004, test device 6: BBa_J364005) along with positive (BBa_I20270) and negative controls (BBa_R0040) inserted in pSB1C3 plasmid were transformed into DH5- alpha cells and tested for fluorescence. The green fluorescent protein served as a marker for promoter activity. The procedure was the same for all the teams participating in iGEM InterLab 2017.

In addition, it has expected increase in fluorescence every two hours. The promoter with the weakest expression of fluorescence appears to be the test device 6, which has values slightly higher than the negative control. The fluorometric readings for the samples with promoters from devices 1,3, and 5 are moderate. If to look at general trends, the results demonstrate the boost in fluorescence after 4 hours of incubation. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 col-md-pull-8 left-sidebar" id="fh5co-sidebar"><DIV class="sidebar-box animate-box"><H3 class="sidebar-heading">Interlab</H3><UL class="sidebar-links"><LI><A id="intr_sb" href="#">Introduction</A></LI><LI><A id="rp_sb" href="#">Protocol for OD600 Reference Point</A></LI><LI><A id="fl_sb" href="#">Protocol for FITC fluorescence Standard Curve</A></LI><LI><A id="cm_sb" href="#">Protocol for Cell Measurements</A></LI><LI><A id="c_sb" href="#">Conclusion</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><FOOTER role="contentinfo" id="fh5co-footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 footer-box"><H3 class="fh5co-footer-heading">School of Science and Technology</H3><UL class="fh5co-footer-links"><LI>Nazarbayev University</LI><LI>Astana, Kazakhstan</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 footer-box"><H3 class="fh5co-footer-heading">Get in touch</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV></FOOTER></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
