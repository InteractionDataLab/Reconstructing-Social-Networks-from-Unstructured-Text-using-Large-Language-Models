Whole construct assembly design
Initially 4 transcriptional units were ordered from IDT company using iGEM promotion. These 4 units were designed (additional flanking 24 bp sequences) in a such way so that it could be amplified using PCR and appropriate primers (Figure 1).

As it can be seen, these 4 transcriptional units have overlapping regions of the length of 49 bp each for Gibson Assembly (Figure 2).

Final construct looks like this (Figure 3):

Design of primers for insertion into pChlamy_4 vector
pChlamy_4 vector ordered from company ThermoFisher was used to check presence of our proteins in C. reinhardtii by Western blotting. This vector is designed in a such way, so that after restriction-ligation cloning into multiple cloning sites, it is fused with resistance gene (Zeocin) and also has V5 epitope with 6xHis tag. During translation target protein is self-cleaved from resistance gene by FMDV 2A peptide.  In order to clone our coding sequence into the pChlamy_4 vector, transcriptional units were PCR amplified using specially primers that added EcoRI from 5’ end and XbaI+PstI from 3’ end. In addition to this, start codon and stop codon were removed, because coding sequence was fused to the resistance gene and addition of additional protein tags require absence of stop codon. After successful PCR, obtained amplicon could be digested with EcoRI+XbaI for further protein analysis (Western Blot/protein purification). In case if protein is desired to be expressed without any additional tags, EcoRI+PstI cloning can be used (Figure 4).

Primers were carefully designed in such a way so that everything remained in frame (Figure 5):

Design of primers for CPEC (Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning) cloning of our parts into pSB1C3 plasmid
pSB1C3 linearized plasmid backbone was PCR amplified by using these two following primers:
Rwd pSB1C3, 39bp

Rev pSB1C3, 41bp

Each part was also PCR amplified in such a way so that it had flanking BioBrick Prefix and Suffix (Figure 6).
Following primers were used for each part (3 bp from 5’ end corresponding to pSB1C3 backbone, BioBrick prefix/suffix and 16-20 bp of overlapping nucleotides with target region at 3’ end of each primer):

After PCR purification of two amplicons (part and backbone), CPEC reaction was run. Then CPEC product was transformed into E. coli and plasmid extraction was performed.
