INSILICO WORK
INTRODUCTION
We carried out insilico studies for both our peptides using ExPASy ProtParam tool and the results are as listed below.
NATIVE LATARCIN
Peptide Sequence: GLFGKLIKKFGRKAISYAVKKARGKH-OH
Number of amino acids: 26
Molecular weight: 2902.57
Theoretical pI: 11.33
Atomic composition

0
Formula: C136H229N41O29
Total number of atoms: 435
Estimated half-life
The N-terminal of the sequence considered is G (Gly).
The estimated half-life is: 30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
>20 hours (yeast, in vivo).
>10 hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo).
Instability index
The instability index (II) is computed to be 1.29
This classifies the protein as stable.
Aliphatic index: 82.69
Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY): -0.438
MUTANT LATARCIN
