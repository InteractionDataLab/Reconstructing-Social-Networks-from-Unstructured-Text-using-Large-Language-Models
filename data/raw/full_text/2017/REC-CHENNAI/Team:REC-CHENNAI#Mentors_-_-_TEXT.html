INVESTIGATORS
Dr. Babuskin
Dr. Babuskin has completed his PhD at Anna University, Chennai. For his PhD thesis, he worked on the development of Functional Foods from Microalgae. He has previously worked on the production of polyhydroxy alkanoates  from waste oil. His research interests are in food product development, biopolymer production, food preservation and Bioprocess Engineering. He can be contacted at buski87@gmail.com.
Dr. V. Gayathri
Dr. V. Gayathri has completed her B.Sc., M.Sc.,and M.Phil in Biochemistry. She got her doctoral degree in the field of Biochemistry-Zoology in 2011. She currently holds the Assistant Professor position in Department of Biotechnology, Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai. Her extensive passion towards research let her to publish a couple of books related to Environmental pollution and about fifteen papers as National & International journal publications and proceedings.  She has also filled three patents related to stored food grain insect control.  She is interested in Genetical engineering and Systems Biology also and guided projected like Cloning and optimizing the expression of IFb1. For the past decade, she has been guiding more than thirty studentâ€™s projects both UG & PG. She always advises students to carry out product oriented research as they would have a great value to the society. At present she is working on the formulation of fish feed, biopesticide against stored food grains removal of oil spill by bioremediation. She can be contacted at gopigaya9@rediffmail.com.
INSTRUCTOR
Dr. Sujata Roy
Dr. Sujata Roy is an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. She mainly works on  In-silico drug designing. She is working to find out the molecular mechanism of main constituent of  different natural products. Recently, she studied actions of Withaferin A and Curcumin. Designing of  drugs for Cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease based on the binding mode and pharmacophoric features of these compounds is the main goal of her research. Another part of her research is on prediction of ADME and toxicity of compounds using Machine Learning Algorithms. You can reach her at sujataroy1@gmail.com.
