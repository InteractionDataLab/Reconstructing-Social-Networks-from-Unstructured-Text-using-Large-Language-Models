SVCE_CHENNAI
Participating in iGEM for the first time, we had Team SVCE_CHENNAI mentor us. Being practically neighbours, they were with us every step of the way, right from troubleshooting our protocols to ordering our g-blocks. Ramit, the student leader of their team had earlier designed a quorum sensing mechanism which we modified and incorporated into our project to overcome the lethal effects of our peptide of interest, latarcin, on the chassis itself.
Biofair
Biofair was an event we conducted in collaboration with SVCE CHENNAI in the month of August, 2017.

COPENHAGEN COLLABORATION
UCopenhagen came up with an innovative idea for creating quality awareness about synthetic biology. "Science out of lab" by UCopenhagen is a podcast series where science was brought into a social, ethical and environmental context by interviewing people from different walks of science. We joined forces with them and interviewed postgraduate students and professors in our city, adding a small value to the podcast series.
ALL INDIA iGEM MEET, PUNE
The All India iGEM Meet was held at IISER, Pune on the 15th and 16th of July,2017. Various iGEM teams from across the country participated in this Meet. The main agenda of this gathering was to allow teams to share their projects, for other teams to put forth suggestions on how to better the team’s project and thus, to basically encourage exchange of ideas between the different teams.
Eminent speakers from various fields of Science were also invited to speak to us. We were allowed to glimpse into some of their astounding work and encouraged to raise questions. IISER Pune was an excellent host in making sure our stay was a memorable one.
This year, two members of our team represented the team’s idea at the All India iGEM Meet in front of an audience of the other Indian iGEM teams. After the presentation, lots of valuable suggestions and feedback was given by the members of the different teams.
We have taken these ideas into consideration and tried to customize our project accordingly.      Being our first iGEM venture, this Meet helped us not just in refining our project, but also in getting to know the other Indian teams.
