Their support and guidance was the driving force that kept us moving forward through this journey. Our special thanks to the chairperson of our college, Dr. (Mrs) Thangam Meganathan, Mr. Abhay Shankar, our principal Dr. S.N Murugesan, and the administrative officers Mr. Thiagarajan, Mr. Balaji and Mr. Tamizhselvan for funding our project and supporting us in this endeavor. </P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="collab2"><DIV class="wrapper"><H1>DR. JAYASREE &amp; DR. JOHANNA RAJKUMAR</H1><P>Jayasree Ma'am, the Head of the Department of Biotechnology, and Johanna ma'am, the Dean, have been our strong pillars of support throughout this journey. When we were initially taking our baby steps towards iGEM, they were on our side, constantly motivating us and have always pushed us to do better. They are the backbone of our team.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="collab1"><DIV class="wrapper"><H1>DEPARTMENT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY</H1><P>We are sincerely thankful to all the teachers, scholars and lab assistants from our department for imparting us with knowledge, providing us with safety training and helping us in lab at all times of the day (and night).</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="collab2"><DIV class="wrapper"><H1>DR. S. BABUSKIN</H1><P>As our primary PI, Babuskin sir has been right with us from our initial brainstorming sessions, where he was instrumental in deciding our project, to the final stages. With numerous friends in the scientific community, sir put us in contact with a lot of scientists and research scholars, who helped us mould our idea to what it is today.</P></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="collab1"><DIV class="wrapper"><H1>DR. V. GAYATHRI</H1><P>Gayathri ma’am has been more than a PI to us. For anything gone right or wrong, she was the first person that we all would contact and report to.
