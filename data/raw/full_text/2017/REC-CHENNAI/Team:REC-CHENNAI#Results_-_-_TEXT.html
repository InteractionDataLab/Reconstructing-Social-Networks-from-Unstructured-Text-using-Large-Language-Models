Results
We carried out transformation using E.coli Dh5a cells.  Three different test concentration of the plasmid was used- 100 pg/µL, 50 pg/µL, 10 pg/µL to estimate the transformation efficiencies. The plasmid contained RFP in a psb1c3 plasmid backbone. The transformation efficiency for each concentration is listed below.
We have also plotted  a standard curve for the growth of E.coli Dh5a cells. When the cells were transformed with a plasmid containing latarcin, we were unable to obtain mature cells due to the toxicity of the peptide to the host. The growth curve for cells containing latarcin is also shown below.

To overcome this problem, we designed the quorum sensing mechanism. However, due time constraints, we were unable to successfully express the protein and test its functionality.
