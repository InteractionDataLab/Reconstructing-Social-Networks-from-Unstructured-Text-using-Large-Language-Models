The ultimate aim of our project is developing a food wrapper, we saw it fitting to consult    experts from the food preservation sector. In light of this, we approached Dr.G.R.Gopi, Director    Fermentech GSV PVT LTD , Thanjavur and Dr.Ng.Iboyaima Singh, Senior Principal scientist, Dept of    Fruit and Vegetable technology, CFTRI. We presented our project to both of them and discussed the    pros and cons of our application.
Dr.G.R Gopi suggested that the haemolytic activity of the peptide could be altered by mutating the     native peptide. On exploring this thought further, we came across a case study that was carried out by     Alexander A.Vassilevski et al. It proposed that a parameter related to hydrophobicity at the N-terminal     of the peptide could be used as a measure of its tendency to exhibit haemolytic activity. After several     discussions, we concluded that the working with the mutated peptide would be more appropriate.
Dr.Ng.Iboyaima Singh felt that our delivery mechanism might not turn out to be cost effective while scaling up. He suggested that we look into active antimicrobial packaging as a viable alternative. However due to time constraints, we were unable to design and bring to life a suitable matrix system for immobilizing our peptide based on this idea. In the future, we plan to work on bringing to life an active packaging system using our peptide.
