Our Instructors
Eddie
Former iGEMer
I was an iGEMer too a few years back then. Being one of the instructors of CUHK IGEM 2017 has been a wonderful experience full of adventures and fun. Let's enjoy the journey. Cheers!
Asa
PhD Structural Biology and Protein Science
It is difficult to manage a team. So, I am glad to have Ryan to work with me, and have support from the professors. While I provided the team proper training in scientific thinking. I hope the jamboree can bring the team excitement and inspiration. Go! iGEMers!
Ryan
PhD Molecular Biology
I am delighted to be one of the PG instructors of CUHK iGEM team. I have gained the administration and guidance experience by mentoring the team. Besides the role of instructor, I enjoy to meet lots of new friends and play with them. Wish we all have a wonderful memory.
