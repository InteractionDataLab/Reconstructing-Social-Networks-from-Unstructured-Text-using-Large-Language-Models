Team training and Project start
Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course?
In CUHK, every student needed to take a synthetic biology course before becoming an iGEM member.
When did you start this course?
The course is opened in the whole spring semester.
Are the syllabus and course materials freely available online?
Yes,
Syllabus is available here
Course material is available here
When did you start your brainstorming?
At the end of the synthetic biology course
When did you start in the lab?
The synthetic biology course required us to do experiment in the lab. We started in the lab from the start of the spring semester.
When did you start working on your project?
We start working our own project from June.
