Add the other Component in the tube. If the added volume is less, pipetting up and down  is necessary.
Mix reagents in tubes by pipetting the solution up and down slowly.
Quick spin the PCR tube to ensure the mixture is in the bottom of the tube.
Put it in the thermocycler (PCR machine) and set the cycle information.
Start the cycle and wait till it is finished.
