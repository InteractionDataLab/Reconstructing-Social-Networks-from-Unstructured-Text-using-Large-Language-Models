Description
Our project for this yearâ€™s iGEM Giant Jamboree has the purpose of improving healthcare conditions in Peruvian agriculture industry. Our objective is to reduce the rate of infection of Avian Influenza through feather waste. As of now, we have begun establishing communications with people in the local agricultural industry and with their valuable input on the topic we are addressing, we plan on identifying the specific problems that we will attempt to alleviate and provide solutions for. However, a challenge that we will surely face in the near future is that of transporting the synthesized DNA sequences through Peruvian customs. In previous opportunities, our progress with similar projects has been hindered by our inability to receive the DNA due to difficulties with bureaucracy and fees imposed by the Peruvian government, seeing as synthetic biology is still a new field in our country.

Advice on writing your Project Description
We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be consist, accurate and unambiguous in your achievements.
Judges like to read your wiki and know exactly what you have achieved. This is how you should think about these sections; from the point of view of the judge evaluating you at the end of the year.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.
