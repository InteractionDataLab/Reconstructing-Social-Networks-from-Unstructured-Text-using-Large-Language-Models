Korea University
 
This year we worked with the prestigious Korean University. Collaborations are an important part of fulfilling the IGEM mission: “to cultivate, support, and grow the community of passionate students, professors and advisors who have participated in the iGEM competition. By building upon the international base of the iGEM competition, the community connects participants and alumni across the world, to engage in dialogue and collaboration.” This affiliation allowed us to fulfil this mission.
Their project consists of using a microbe as a disease testing machine. It would allow the one taking the pill to know if they have a disease such as colon cancer by showing fluorescents in human excrement. It has the potential to save time, energy, and even lives.
We held meetings through skype and kept in contact constantly since our first meeting that took place August 14th. We discussed project scheduling, wiki management, part submission and some other fulfilments for medal criteria. Throughout this time, we were able to provide them with __as they were very generous to provide us with their expertise in the subject since they are a much more experienced team.
Their assistance and advice had a strong impact on our project. We are thankful for this opportunity.
