Throughout the year, we worked closely with our high school newspaper, The Condor's Nest, which has a strong presence within the Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt Community. The human practices department worked along with some of the strongest writers in our school community to generate a powerful article. In this article we explain the in’s and out’s of our project. The insights, process and challenges. All of it. The intention of creating such an article was to educate the community and __.
 
We didn’t stop there. We stepped out of our school community and went a step further. We worked with Altavoz, a newspaper with the peruvian public. After carefully crafted our article with the goal of transmitting the idea and importance of synthetic biology to the peruvian community. We explained how the issue is important by showing the obvious benefits for the society although there are some controversial ethical opinions for many.
