Hyunjun Jared Park
Student Leader
 
Jared is a senior at our international high school who currently studies biology and physics. He is the student leader of team this year after having participated in the competition in 2016. His primary work was to manage all the departments by having all the members from each department work cooperatively rather focusing solely on their main work. Additionally, he coded the entire wiki. While recognizing the fact that the team is composed of high school students, he hopes that the project could provide a small benefit to developing countries for a better world.
 
 
Andre Rosen
Research Leader
 
Andre is a senior at our international high school  who currently studies biology and sport science. He is the leader of research department and has provided proficient levels of investigation, allowing the team to understand the seriousness of the problem in the Peruvian society. His main role was not just to focus on the research but also to help other members comprehend professional science journals according to their level. Developing the initial idea for the project with Jared, he also hopes that the project could contribute to the communities from developing countries, hoping for a better world.
 
 
Leonardo Jimenez
Research Co-Leader
 
Leonardo is a senior at our international high school  who currently studies biology and psychology. He is the co-leader of research department and has focused mostly on relating the project to the real world and conducting literature review. Leonardo was a great leader as he provided a bridge between the research and human practices department so that the members could communicate and share information with clear purpose.
 
 
Guillermo de la Torre
Research Department
 
Guillermo is a senior at our international high school who currently studies biology and chemistry. Apart from Jared, Guillermo is the only member who has remained in the team from last year. He mainly focused on providing insights to the members of the team by sharing his experience of interacting with other teams in iGEM competition. Not only so but he has done a great job providing assistance to the research department as he shown a great level of investigation and has shared his skills with the team.
 
 
Isabel Windsor
Human Practices Co-Leader
 
Isabel is a sophomore at our international high school. Although she joined the team late, she has shown great enthusiasm and has worked very hard to communicate and share our project with the Peruvian community. Although she is not familiar with synthetic biology, she is on her way developing her interest in this field. She is looking forward on visiting the competition in Giant Jamboree as this is her first year participating in iGEM.
 
 
Karina Vastergaard
Research Department
 
Karina is a sophomore at our international high school. After being introduced about the topic of synthetic biology in her class, she has been participating in the project work with high interest. Although she has already worked on a similar project for her class, this is her first year participating in the competition.
 
 
Andres Lassus
Funds Manager & Human Practices Co-Leader
 
Andres is a junior at our international high school who is studying physics. Through his participation in iGEM, he has expanded his interest in the field of biology, especially in synthetic biology. Although he was overwhelmed by the topic in the beginning, he has shown a great interaction with the community by sharing and promoting the project. Not only so but as he had great connections with various universities and firms, he was able to build a connection between the team and other organizations.
