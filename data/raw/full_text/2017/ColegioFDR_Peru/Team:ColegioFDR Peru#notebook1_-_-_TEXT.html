Week 1.
We researched several gastrointesintal diseases and its causes.
Additionally, we researched existing diagnostic methods used in detecting these diseases.
 
 
Week 2.
We looked for gut microbiome distribution in the gut and bacterias that are currently verified and utilized in probiotics.
Also, we chose heme, pH, bile salt as our target indicator, which could detect the diseases we previously researched on the first week.
 
 
Week 3.
We designed a detector device based on analyzation of prior research about sensing heme, pH, and bile salt.
 
Week 4.
We received Lactobacillus plantarum L67 from professor Se Jong Oh of Chunnam University, and cultured them in MRS media.
We collected single colony from them and cultured it.
We then cultured these bacteria in culture medium that contain ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and tested antibiotic resistance.
 
 
Week 5.
Our Professor gave us a feedback on the experiment conducted in week 4. Based on the feedback, we revised the problematic part and conducted the experiment again.
We compared the test result and verified antibiotic resistance data of L. plantarum, and checked if the right bacteria was cultured.
We researched on transformation protocol of Lactobacillus transformation and referenced protocol of Eppendorf.
