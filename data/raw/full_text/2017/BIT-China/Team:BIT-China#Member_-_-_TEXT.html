TongJin Jia（贾锦彤）
I’m the eldest member in this team. As an advisor, I’m in charge of sweet receptor expression and speech organization. I believe there's always a way as long as you maintain in a good state of mind.
JiangPing Ni（倪江萍）
I am mainly responsible for the route of sensing sweetness and the host detection. My major is biology and my interests include singing and playing volleyball. I am an outgoing girl and I like to meet different people and go to different places.
ShiChao Ren (任师超)
As an advisor, I'm in charge of the work that related to the transformation of the host. I'm drunk in biochemical engineering and still not awake. If there is no lemon so sour you can't make something resembling lemonades, maybe I just need some to sober up.
Tian Jiang (姜恬)
Hello, my name is Tian Jiang. I am a graduate student in BIT majoring in Biology. My research area is enzyme engineering. I am a girl interested in reading and running, besides I enjoy the entertainment in scientific research process. Luckily, I join in the 2017 iGEM competition as an adviser in BIT-China and my mission is to help the undergraduate students to solve the problems in this research and give proper suggestions. Thanks all my teammates.
JingPeng Hu (胡鹏晶)
My grandmother once said : ”you will change the world in the future, my dear grandson.” So today, I am here and join the iGEM 2017 in order to make my grandmother’s dream come true. Save the world and protect the all human being! If you also have the same dream, I will be with you!
Yu Zhang (张宇)
My name is Zhang Yu, a student from the bioengineering major of Beijing Institute of Technology. I'm outgoing and energetic. In BIT-CHINA , I am mainly responsible for the work of the reformation of host and the synthesis of T1R3. I appreciate that the competition help me improve my ability and make many friends.
Lu Chen (陈璐)
Hi! I’m Lu Chen majoring in biotechnology. I’m responsible for the signal reporter device and paperwork. I like watching movies, TV shows, and animation, but I’m not a otaku girl. Joining in iGEM and working with my teammates make me feel like we can change the world, and we will.
QiWei Huang (黄绮薇)
Hi！I'm Qiwei Huang. My major is biotechnology. In BIT-China, I am mainly responsible for art design and I am pretty enjoy it. I wish Sugar Hunter would provide people with a new method and idea towards taste bio-sensing. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
