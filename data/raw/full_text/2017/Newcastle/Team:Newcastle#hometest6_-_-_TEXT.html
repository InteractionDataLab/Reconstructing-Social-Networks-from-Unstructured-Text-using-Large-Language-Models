A New Era of Biosensors
Biosensors...
...have applications in many aspects of life; from agriculture (testing for pesticides/herbicides) to medicine (diagnostic tests), and everything in between. Unfortunately, biosensor development can be far from simple. Below are some of the major issues identified during this project.

Our research showed that the overwhelming majority of biosensors fit into a specific design pattern: a 'detector' module, which interacts with the target of choice; a 'processing' module, which does something to a signal (e.g. amplification); and a 'reporter' module, which converts the genetic signal into something which can be perceived by the user or a machine (e.g. a colourmetric output or a change in pH). By making biosensor designs modular in this way, the development of future biosensors can directly benefit from previous designs. This is possible because the processing and reporter modules of a previous design could be connected to a new detector module, hence creating a new biosensor without re-designing new genetic circuit components.
The Sensynova Framework takes this concept further by drawing on the wealth of literature regarding the advantages of multicellular communities in synthetic biology. Each module described above is separated into separate cells, which can be co-cultured to form a functioning biosensor. This allows for truly 'plug-and-play' behaviour, in which a newly designed detector module within a cell can be simply added to previously designed and characterised processing and reporter module cells without requiring any DNA assembly or re-designing of parts.
