Reactions were prepared according to the manufactuer's protocol
Reactions were made up to 50 μL and pipetted into wells of a flat-bottom black 96 well plate
Reactions were incubated in a plate reader (BMG Fluostar Optima) for ~4 hours with fluorescence readings every 15 mins - gain was set at 900
For the Luc1 & 2 and Neg1 & 2 reactions, after four hours the plate was removed and 50 μL Luciferase assay reagent was added to the reactions before luminescence was measured by the plate reader
The gain was calculated as 40% of Luc1

Time course of commercial S30 circular CFPS systems expressing pSB1AT3-mRFP1: Data points are averages of triplicate repeats and error bars show plus and minus standard error. Red circles are reactions with no plasmid DNA, black squares are reactions with 1 μg plasmid DNA, and blue triangles are reactions with 1.7 μg plasmid DNA.
End point luminescence readings for commercial S30 cicular CFPS systems expressing pBEST-Luc: Data points are averages of duplicate reactions and error bars show plus and minus standard error. 'Neg' reactions contained no plasmid DNA. 'Luc' reactions contained 2 μg pBEST-Luc. Readings were taken after 3.75 hours incubation at 37oC. The Y axis is in log10.
