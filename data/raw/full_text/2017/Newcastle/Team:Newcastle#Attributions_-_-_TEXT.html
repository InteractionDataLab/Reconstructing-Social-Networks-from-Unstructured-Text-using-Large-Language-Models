This year our team consisted of 8 molecular biologists, a life scientist, a computer scientist, a forensic scientist, a chemical engineer and an English student. We bring different branches of expertise together and are a true example of an interdisciplinary team. We decided on our project idea during April, after months of intense and independent discussions. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code, wiki and results documented on our Wiki were performed, written and collected by the Sensynova team.

All supervisors and advisers gave advice to the team over a range of areas, including the initial project idea and help in the laboratory. Anil Wipat: PI - general advice Thomas Howard: Second PI - general advice Jon Marles-Wright: Instructor - general advice Dana Ofiteru: Instructor - general advice Angel Go√±i-Moreno: Instructor - modelling advice Wendy Smith: Adviser - general and laboratory advice Michael White: Adviser - laboratory advice Alice Banks: Adviser - laboratory advice
Jonny Naylor: Help with the modelling aspect of the project, specifically with his Simbiotics software (which he customised to our needs!) James McLaughlin: Assisted us with the technical aspects of our wiki. Exeter iGEM 2017: Analysed our deGFP construct for us using their fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting machine. Evry Paris-Saclay 2017: collaborated with us to test their novel synthetic promoter regulated by psicose in our Sensynova framework. Dr Chris French, Dr Martin Peacock, Dr Karen Polizzi and Dr Oliver Purcell for their invaluable insight into biosensor development and their help in influencing our project. Ivy Wellman from DEFRA: For her insight into the legislative procedure deliberate release of GMOs into the environment. Jasmine Bird: Took time to help proof-read the wiki and suggest improvements.
