Biological systems are extremely sensitive to cellular and environmental changes, therefore standardisation of gene expression is essential for reliable measurements. The lack of these standards presents a potential limitation to the development of Sensynova and other genetically engineered devices. To address this issue, we examined the variability found between identical genetically engineered devices under different environmental conditions and as a result of using different assembly standards.</P><H2 class="text-left" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-family: Rubik">Optimum DNA Assembly Standards</H2><P>Gibson assembly proved to be the least time-consuming method to manually produce the synthetic GFP reporter gene compared to Golden Gate and BioBricks. The production of the GFP reporter construct using the Biobricks method was unsuccessful; the multiple steps involved, time consuming methodology and inefficient enzyme activities throughout this process lead to a limited number of parts that were able to be joined. Additionally, it was found that joining the smaller parts; the promoter and RBS was more challenging than joining the larger parts in the manual assembly. The Golden Gate assembly method successfully produced the GFP reporter construct, however it involved more steps and was more time consuming than Gibson assembly. A major limitation of this investigation was human error and a difference in user.
The Gibson assembly construct had a higher GFP expression level after 24 hours, at 7.46x105 AFU/OD<SUB>600</SUB> with the standard error of 6.51x104 AFU/OD<SUB>600</SUB>, compared to the Golden Gate assembly construct which had the final GFP expression level of 2.17x105 AFU/OD<SUB>600</SUB> with the standard error of 6.68x104 AFU/OD<SUB>600</SUB> (Figure 1).

Gibson assembly proved to be the optimum DNA assembly standard, producing a gene construct that had no sequence scars and had the highest expression of downstream products. It was additionally the simplest and least time-consuming manual assembly method. The optimum conditions for the expression of the GFP reporter gene were 31ᵒC LB growth media, at pH 9 using a BL21 E. coli chassis. However, there were some anomalies and unexplained outcomes from the different combinations of variables and these optimum conditions were found to differ from the optimum conditions for the growth of the E. coli chassis.

</P><P style="margin-top: 2%">This research provides the foundations for the development of automated, high-throughput methods of DNA assembly and characterisation of genetic circuits, which will lend itself to a wide range of beneficial applications. There are several competing standards for constructing DNA parts into circuits with various requirements and disadvantages but there has been relatively little previous research into the direct effects of different DNA assembly methods on the expression of genes. Therefore, these findings provide a valuable contribution to a plethora of future developments within the field of synthetic biology.


      
</P><H2 class="text-left" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-family: Rubik">Further Work</H2><P style="margin-top: 2%">Reporting accurate measurements is crucial, but can prove a challenge. Device operation is often measured against optical density, but this can be affected by various factors, such as the plasmid copy number and variable cell count. The Interlab study used standards such as Ludox and fluorescein, which help standardisation across various labs and instruments, but do not account for natural variation. In order to combat the difficulty of reporting measurements accurately, we decided to design an internal control featuring monomeric RFP.

</P><P style="margin-top: 2%">GFP tends to show a high Copy-Number Variation (CNV), and this combined with its unreliable cell count can render it a non-optimal fluorescence standard. In a study conducted by Kosuri <I>et al</I>. (2013), “GFP expression levels varied over approximately four orders of magnitude compared with relatively constant red fluorescence”. Copy number is affected by many factors, such as culture conditions, the ori, the size of the plasmid, the growth rate, etc. In the absence of selection, high-copy number plasmids are typically lost from populations at a high rate, making plasmid loss a key factor in limiting accurate measurements.

</P><P style="margin-top: 2%">RFP’s high, constant levels of brightness, a relatively low number of base-pairs, and availability of multiple assays to measure its fluorescence such as spectrophotometry and microscopic assays, make it a viable choice for an internal control. By integrating a monomeric RFP reporter into the current iGEM Interlab plasmids, it is hypothesized that a better alternative to Ludox and fluorescein can be found in RFP. 
</P><P style="margin-top: 2%">A comparison of fluorescence versus OD measurements across multiple plates of both interlab plasmids as well as plasmids with the proposed internal control, should indicate the reliability of the RFP unit as a standard. </P><H4 class="text-left" style="margin-top: 2%; margin-bottom: 1%; font-family: Rubik">Design</H4><P style="margin-top: 2%"><A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2205000"><B>BBa_K2205000</B></A> is a proposed composite BioBrick reporter that constitutively produces MFRP1 (Figure 3.1). It possesses an MRFP1 coding sequence (E1010) after a strong Anderson promoter (J23100) and RBS (B0034). A double terminator (B0015) was added after the MRFP1 sequence. A BioBrick RFC10 prefix and suffix were added as well. Three twins were discovered after submission to the Registry. The construct was submitted to IDT for synthesis as a gBlock.

Future work could be conducted by further characterising this part and acquiring OD and fluorescence values on a plate reader of an assembled interlab plasmid against interlab devices without an internal control. Ideally, the RFP should maintain constant levels of fluorescence regardless of cell count and copy numbers across all plates, and provide an internal standard for comparison against GFP fluorescence. This addition could extensively improve variation issues encountered in the InterLab Study.
