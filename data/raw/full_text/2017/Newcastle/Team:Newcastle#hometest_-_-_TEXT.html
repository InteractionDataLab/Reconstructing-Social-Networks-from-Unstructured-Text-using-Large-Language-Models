Biosensors can be defined as systems containing
genetic elements which are capable of detecting
and responding to a target signal/molecule.
A plethora of biosensors are created
by iGEM teams each year, yet many
are not used in the field.
After a systematic review of biosensors
from iGEM projects and talks with
biosensor developers, five main
problems were identified.
