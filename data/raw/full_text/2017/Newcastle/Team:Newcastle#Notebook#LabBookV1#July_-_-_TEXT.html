Checking For and Harvesting Colonies
Transformation plate had colonies
Most not green, some fluorescent green (due to backbone re-ligation)
Picked 6 non-green colonies for overnight cultures (using pipette tip)
5 ml LB in each tube

Digestion
Digest of sarcosine oxidase PSB1C3 (from transformed E.coli) for confirmation it's present
16 µl sample
2 µl buffer (cutsmart)
1 µl Xbal
1 µl Spe1
Gel
Gel run of SOX PSB1C3 digest
• 3.4 µl 6x loading dye
• 1 µl Nancy 520
• 10 µl in each well
Digestion was good, but 2 lanes showed an empty backbone where the plasmid had re-ligated without GFP or SOX
Didn't label which digest sample came from which miniprep, so digest and gel repeated to determine the 2 with the empty backbone
102 and 104 had the empty PSB1C3 backbone
103 will be used for transformation into BL21-DE3 cells because the band was the strongest, indicating more SOX in that sample
Competent cells
Prepared overnight culture of BL21-DE3 cells from streak plate
• Picked 'colony' in 5 ml of LB
• 37C, ~16h
July 18th
Sarcosine Oxidase
