Team Newcastle '17 Presents...
Biosensor genetic networks are typically encoded on a single plasmid within a single chassis. However, this configuration can create stress on the host organism as they have to express the entire network, and the biosensor can not be easily modified or re-purposed for new applications.
To alleviate these problems, we propose that biosensor networks are split into three whole-cell modules; a detector, a processor, and a reporter.
With this in mind, we have created the 'Sensynova Biosensor Development Framework'. This framework separates each module into individual cells which communicate via quorum sensing molecules. This separation creates an off-the-shelf set of cellular modules that can be mixed to form new biosensor applications and configurations. This approach also enables biosensor variants to be made and tested without the need for long and tedious genetic cloning steps.
We have also included an optional 'adapter' module. To learn more about our framework, go to our project description page!
