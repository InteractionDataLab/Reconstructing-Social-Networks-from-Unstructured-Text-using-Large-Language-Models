Most of these parts are basic parts, like from BBa_K2509000 to BBa_K2509005 that encode proteins expressed and purified as antigens to immunize rabbits. Some of them like BBa_K2509007 and BBa_K2509008 encode proteins or small tags that will be expressed at the outer membrane of E.coli strains as binding sites with B cells. The BBa_K2509019 or BBa_K2509020 are used as donor proteins for fusion with other proteins or small tags that need to be expressed at the surface of E.coli strains.
