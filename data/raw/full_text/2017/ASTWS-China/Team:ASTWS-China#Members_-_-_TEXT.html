ASTWS-China
Members
ASTWS-China is the name of our team. AST comes from our most important sponsor AST Space, a community open lab located at Zhejiang Science & Technology Museum (AST could be initial of Art, Science and Technology); WS comes from the initial of our general supporter Worldshaper Fellows Program, a popular science program for youth under guidance of Zhejiang Association for Science & Technology; and China means the majority of team come from China.
Comparing with most of iGEM teams whose team members come from same school, ASTWS-China is a particular team. Actually our team consists by 15 Chinese students coming from 11 different high schools located in among 8 Chinese and U.S. cities. Therefore, it is so hard for us to work together for most of times. Thanks to the Internet, we were able to have regular online meeting to discuss the project or assigned the works. And this unforgettable summer of iGEM will be our common memory forever.
