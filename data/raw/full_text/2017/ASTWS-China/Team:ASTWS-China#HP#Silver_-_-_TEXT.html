HUMAN PRACTICE-Silver
In order to find an advisable research direction, we did brain storming lead by Professor Zhang and Dr. Dong, literature research, as well as interview on experts and general public.
The interviews with professionals, including Dr. Chenglong Sun from Hangzhou First People’s Hospital, Dr. Qichun Wei from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medicine School,  as well as Dr. Xiuli Song and Mr. Jihong Dai from Hangzhou HuaAn Biotechnology Co., Ltd, helped us gradually clarify our research direction. Moreover, Dr. Ya Zhai from Southeastern University gave us her professional suggestions on our research proposal and helped us avoid wasting time on incorrect direction. Dr. Song’s suggestion on biosafety also very helpful. The information in detail could be found Integrated and Gold HP page.
We did some interviews in person as well as survey on-line to general public so as to investigate the public opinion, and successfully received 102 valid feedbacks. The samples were including almost half males and half females, and most of participants (68%) were senior high school students, similar age as us. Upon the results (see below), we found that public lacked knowledge about antibody, i.e. almost half of people had absolutely no idea on B cells, more than 60% participants know nothing about Hybridoma technology. Public (86%) did not familiar the synthetic biology neither. However, after a brief introduction the overwhelming majority (79%) of participants take a positive viewpoint of our project.
According to results, we decided to extend our HP work to education and public engagement, especially to the high school students.  For more information see Education and Public Engagement page.
