In order to find an advisable research direction, the instructor Professor Zhang and team PI Dr. Dong organized brain storming several times in May, in between we did the literature research and interviews.
We found that cancer has become one of the most deathful diseases over decades, with the increasing understanding of cancers, people begin to pay more attention on their health conditions. Therefore, the original idea of this research project came from public general concern of cancers. We planned to start a project on studying a cheaper and better cancer treatment. In order to better understand the current situation of cancer treatment, we interviewed two clinic doctors in hospital working related to malignant tumor.
