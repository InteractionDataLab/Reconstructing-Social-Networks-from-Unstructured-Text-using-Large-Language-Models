NOTEBOOK
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
1. Weigh agarose powder and TAE buffer according to a proper portion, and add them to a 100ml conical flask (we usually make 1.5% Agarose Gel).
2. Melt the mixture in a microwave until the solution becomes clear (don’t leave the microwave).
3. Let the solution cool down to about 40-50℃ and add DNA gel stain (usually we use EB), pour the solution into the gel casting tray with appropriate comb. 
4. Let the gel cool until it becomes solid.
5. Pull out the comb carefully.
6. Place the gel in the electrophoresis chamber.
7. Add enough TAE Buffer so that there is about 2-3mm of buffer over the gel.
8. Pipette DNA samples mixed with appropriate amount of DNA loading buffer (the dye/GeneFinder is in the loading buffer) into wells on the gel.
9. Run the gel at 135V for about twenty minutes.
 
Basic ELISA Protocol
There are many different types of ELISAs, which can detect the presence of protein in serum or
supernatent. One of the most common types of ELISA is the so-called "sandwich ELISA." It is termed this because the antibody that you are detecting gets sandwiched between an antigen and a chromogenically-conjugated antibody. Below you will find a basic protocol for this assay.
1、To coat the plate with the appropriate antigen, fill the microwells of a Immuno Plate with 100uL of the diluted antigen.
2、Incubate at 4℃overnight
3、Wash the unbound antigen off the plate by flicking the contents of the plate into the sink, fill the wells with PBS-Triton, flick again, repeat 2X with PBS-Triton.
4、Block non-specific binding by adding 200uL of 1%BSA/PBS
5、Incubate for 30-60minutes at Room Temperature (RT)
6、Wash plate as above
7、Add 100uL of (diluted) samples to appropriate wells. Be sure to include positive and negative controls, and, if necessary, a standard curve.
8、Incubate for 1hour at RT
9、Repeat washing step
10、Prepare appropriate dilution of the second step antibody conjugated either with Alkaline Phosphatase or Horseradish Peroxidase. (antibodies should be titrated for optimal dilution)
11、Add 100uL of second step antibody to wells and incubate for 1hr
12、Repeat washing step
13、Prepare substrate solution*
14、Add 100uL of substrate to well and incubate at RT for 60min
15、add stopping solution if appropriate
16、Read plates on an ELISA plate reader
*Common Substrates and the appropriate plate reader setting

cation- exchange chromatography
Sample preparation
For optimal growth, induction and cell lysis conditions, please refer to established protocols.
The sample should be fully dissolved. To avoid column clogging, we recommend centrifugation and filtration through a 0.22 μm filter to remove cell debris or other particulate material.
Purification procedure for a packed column
1. If the column contains 20% ethanol, wash it with 5 column volumes of distilled water.
2. Equilibrate the column with 5-10 column volumes of binding buffer. or until the column effluent shows stable conductivity and pH values.
Bind the sample
1. Add 10 ml of sample to 1 ml of the 50% slurry. Binding capacity of  SP Sepharose  Fast Flow
 is protein dependent and the average is  40 mg/ml. This means that 1 ml of the 50% slurry can bind about  20 mg of total protein.
2. Incubate sample and the SP Sepharose  Fast Flow slurry at room temperature on a shaker at low  speed for 1 h.
3. Load sample/SP Sepharose  Fast Flow mix onto the 1ML columns and collect flowthrough.
Buffer wash and elution
1. Wash with 5 × 1 ml of binding buffer and collect both fractions.
2. Elute with 4×1ml of elution buffer and collect the eluted fractions in four separate tubes.
Regeneration
After each separation, elute any reversibly bound material either with a high ionic strength solution(1 M NaCl in buffer) or by increasing pH. Regenerate the medium by washing with at least 5 bed volumes of buffer, or until the column effluent shows stable conductivity and pH values.
Measure absorbance at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer and confirm purity of pooled fractions by  SDS-PAGE. Use elution buffer  as the blank.
Store
Store the beads in 20% EtOH.

DNA purification/Axygen gel extraction
1. Excise the agarose gel slice containing the DNA fragment of interest with a clean, sharp scalpel under ultraviolet illumination.
2. Absorb the liquids left on the surface of the gel slices using paper towels. Weigh gel slice (tare with empty tube).
3. Add 3 volumes of DE-A buffer per mg of gel (so a 100mg gel gets 300ul of buffer).
4. Resuspend the gel in Buffer DE-A by vortexing. Heat at 75℃ until the gel is completely dissolved (keep heating for 6-8 minutes). If low-melt agarose gel is used, you may heat it at 40℃. Intermittently vortexing every 2-3 minutes will do a lot of help to accelerate the solubilization.
Note: Buffer DE-A is red liquid, so you can observe the color to make sure the gel is fully dissolved.
5. Add 0.5× Buffer DE-A volume of Buffer DE-B and mix. If the DNA fragment is less than 400bp, supplement further with a 1×sample volume of isopropanol.
Note: After the addition of DE-B, the solution should be in the uniform color of yellow.
6. Place a Miniprep column into a 2ml microfuge tube (provided). Transfer the solubilized agarose from the step above into the column. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
7. Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 500ul of Buffer W1. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
8. Return the Miniprep column to the 2ml microfuge tube and add 700ul of Buffer W2. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
9 Place the Miniprep column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Add a second 700ul of Buffer W2 and centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate from the 2ml microfuge tube.
10. Place the Miniprep column back into the 2ml microfuge tube. Centrifuge at 12,000×g for 1 minute.

Note: Pre-warm the ddH2O at 65℃ will generally improve elution efficiency.
