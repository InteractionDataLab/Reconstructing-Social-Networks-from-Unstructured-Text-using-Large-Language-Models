Our project can be divided into four parts. In our team prepared several recombinants proteins as antigens for immunization, and finally separated the B cells from the rabbits that immunized with antigens. In part II, we screened several outer membrane proteins and chose two of the best as donor proteins used in surface display. Then we co-expressed antigen peptides and affinity tags by fusing with these two donor proteins respectively in part III. Through the work of part II and part III, we successfully made the E.coli strains, which we named it ‘smart E.coli’. And in part IV, we did some tests and verifying our project using two models and a real binding experiment.

Our ‘Smart E.coli’ can also be applied to many aspects with enormous value just by making some little modifications, such as vaccine producing and immune T-cells or tumor cells separations.
