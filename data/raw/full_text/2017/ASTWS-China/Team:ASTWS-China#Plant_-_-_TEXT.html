Our idea of project comes from Hybridoma technology. We found some disadvantage about the old technology. In order to improve this technology, we started this project. We also want to know how most of people thinks about Hybridoma technology and our new approach. So we make a questioner to collect others view about our project.
To know the opinion from normal people, we started a questionnaire on WeChat.According to the result, we found that most people only know a little or even none about B cells and Hybridoma technology. But after our introduction, most of them show their support to our project.
