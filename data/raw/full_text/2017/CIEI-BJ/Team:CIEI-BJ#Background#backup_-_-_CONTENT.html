These buzzing creatures are always flying around, stinging every being on which they can be fed with blood. Everyone must have been the victim of these tiny, annoying ‘bombers’ at least once. However, even with that diminutive figure, mosquito can bring troubles far worse than being bitten.</P><P class="my-content">Among all species of mosquitoes, those that have evolved the life cycle interfering  humans are responsible for transmitting harmful infections within the settlements. The saliva of mosquitoes is where the danger hides. Saliva mainly serves as circumventing the physical responses of the preys. Through continuously stinging among different individuals, the saliva of mosquitoes that have contacted with the blood may contain pathogens of various kinds of diseases. </P><DIV class="first-level" id="a2">Mosquito-Borne Diseases</DIV><DIV class="second-level" id="a3">Malaria</DIV><P class="my-content">As a mosquito-borne infectious disease, malaria is widely spread within tropical and subtropical regions where the combination of moisture and heat provides ideal environment for reproduction of mosquitoes.

        </DIV></DIV><P class="my-content">To prevent the devastating disaster brought by mosquitoes, people have come up with several basic methods to restrain the spread of pathogens. The first is to prevent the mosquitoes from entering human colonies. The second is to directly eliminate the mosquitoes either by poisonous medicines or physical ways including beat and electric shocks. The third method utilizes chemicals to disturb the mosquitoes. Mosquitoes mainly identify the hosts by detecting the CO2 released or by the amino acids that form the odor from animals or humans. Therefore, when the substance can produce smell that mosquitoes dislike, or can leak molecules that block the receptors of mosquitoes, the mosquitoes can be successfully repelled.[7]</P><P class="my-content">To identify the effectiveness of current mosquito repellent products, we looked up for existing researches as well as surveyed by ourselves on people’s opinions. </P><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="content-left"><P class="my-content">Fig 1 Purpose of using anti-mosquito products</P></DIV><DIV class="content-right"><P class="my-content">Q9 Your Age/ Q4 The Main purpose of using mosquito repellents (Multiple Choice)</P><P class="my-content">Avoid the mosquito borne diseases（e.g malaria）</P><P class="my-content">Among the people aged 16 or older who polled , only 39% of them claimed that they are aware of the danger of mosquito-borne disease.</P></DIV></DIV><P class="my-content">Here are several types of mosquito repellent products that we’ve surveyed on:</P><DIV class="first-level" id="a6">Current Mosquito Repellent Products</DIV><DIV class="second-level" id="a7">Mosquito Net</DIV><P class="my-content">Mosquito net has been an orthodox tool to repel mosquitoes. However, there are still several constraints upon it. For instance, its portability is frustrating. Consequently, it only contributes to protect human from sleep disturbance caused by mosquitoes.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a8">Burdick Lamp</DIV><P class="my-content">Burdick lamp seems to be effective as the ultra violet light attracts mosquitoes, while the fact is  that carbon dioxide released by humans tempt mosquitoes better. Therefore when putting one person and one Burdick lamp into the same room, mosquitoes will simply ignore the lamp and pounce on the person, sucking as many drops of blood as they can.[8]</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a9">Mosquito Repellent Bracelet</DIV><P class="my-content">Safety of these products worth suspicion. According to quality research, harmful substances were checked out in 37.14% of samples, seven samples contained insectifuge ester, five samples contained toluene, one sample contained benzene, toluene, xylene.[9]</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a10">Mosquito coil</DIV><P class="my-content">A mosquito repelling incense made from a dried paste of pyrethrum powder, usually made into a spiral. A mosquito-repellent smoke can be produced through burning. Being aware of the potential for developing fire hazards, consumers have to be careful with using mosquito coils. Some studies highlight concerns when mosquito coils are used in closed rooms. Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM 2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. [10] Moreover, smoke produced from coil combustion may cause sensory irritation of respiratory system.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a11">Citronellol Oil</DIV><P class="my-content">Citronella oil enjoys a widespread reputation of repelling mosquitoes. Unfortunately, one of its ingredients, methyl eugenol, has been proved that it can cause great irritation to our skin.   Concerning its doubtful safety, Canadian Ministry of Health bans citronella oil.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a12">Floral Water</DIV><P class="my-content">The most common repellent for mosquitoes in China must be Floral water. But this doesn’t mean that it is the safest. 75% of floral water is literally alcohol, which is combustible. In consequence, we mustn’t go into kitchen and have to keep ourselves away from cigarettes after applying floral water to our skin. Furthermore, if we overuse Floral water, it will harm our body for the ingredient DEET or BAAPE is actually poisonous.</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TH>Types of Mosquito Repellent Product</TH><TH>Advantages</TH><TH>Disadvantages</TH></TR><TR><TD>Mosquito Net</TD><TD>Effective in protection</TD><TD>Lack Portability</TD></TR><TR><TD>Burdick Lamp</TD><TD>Can attract mosquitoes</TD><TD>Less efficient in killing mosquitoes</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mosquito Repellent Bracelet</TD><TD>Convenient with no pungent odor</TD><TD>Has no actual impact on repelling mosquitoes</TD></TR><TR><TD>Mosquito Coil</TD><TD>Valid in eliminating mosquitoes</TD><TD>Might cause fire hazards, produce irritating smoke</TD></TR><TR><TD>Citronellol Oil</TD><TD>Good reputation for mosquito repelling</TD><TD>Irritation to skin, is banned in some countries</TD></TR><TR><TD>Floral Water</TD><TD>Nice odor with some effects</TD><TD>Combustible, poisonous when being overused</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="content-left"><P class="my-content">Fig. 2  Comments on effectiveness of products</P></DIV><DIV class="content-right"><P class="my-content">Towards the current mosquito repellent products, only about half of the participators feel satisfied. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="content-wrapper"><DIV class="content-left"><P class="my-content">Fig. 3 Worry towards mosquito repellent product</P></DIV><DIV class="content-right"><P class="my-content">Most participators have considered the negative effect of anti-mosquito products on humans, this means that potential consumers care about whether the product is poisonous.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="first-level" id="a13">Challenges in Mosquito Repellent</DIV><DIV class="second-level" id="a14">1. Suitable for Majority</DIV><P class="my-content">Only when a repellent is suitable for the majority can it be good and widespread. To elaborate, not only healthy adults can use it, but infants, children, the old, pregnant women, the disabled and many others who are vulnerable can also use it.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a15">2. Efficacy</DIV><P class="my-content">To be a good mosquito repellent, efficacy is a consequential standard that should always be regarded. An ideal repellent ought to repel or even kill a large amount of mosquitoes. In this case, repellents like floral water whose DEET or BAAPE is little don’t really reach our demands.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a16">3. Portability</DIV><P class="my-content">Being portable is very important. If it is too heavy or too big for us to carry around, how can it protect us from those voracious mosquitoes which seem to never have enough blood? </P><DIV class="second-level" id="a17">4. Simple Procedures without Pollution</DIV><P class="my-content">It is better for producing procedures of repellents to be as simple as possible. If the process is too complicated, the cost will rise as well. Plus, an ideal repellent has to be environmental-friendly, which means no pollutants should be emitted during manufacturing or after being used.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a18">5. High Productivity </DIV><P class="my-content">Last but not least, it is of necessity of repellents production to have high productivity. With much of the reactants turning into products, the company can reduce the waste of raw materials as well as successfully cutting down the budget. </P><P class="my-content">Considering all the challenges we mentioned above, lots of improvements can be made. Therefore, our team utilized citronellol as the main substance for repellents.</P><DIV class="first-level" id="a19">Citronellol (C<SUB>10</SUB>H<SUB>20</SUB>O)</DIV><P class="my-content">Citronellol is a natural substance extracted from Cymbopogon. It acts as an effective mosquito repellent which has already been applied to some products. Citronellol releases a natural odor smells like roses, which makes it a common ingredient of perfume and spices. The United States FDA considers citronellol as generally  safe (GRAS) for food use, which ensures its safety.[11]</P><P class="my-content">People have been researching for better methods of synthesizing citronellol for decades. Here we list some typical pathways.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a20">Typical Citronellol Synthetic Pathways</DIV><DIV class="third-level">1)Geraniol Hydrogenation [12]</DIV><P class="my-content">Fig.4 process of Geraniol Hydrogenation</P><P class="my-content">The main source of geraniol is palmarosa oil, which is a high cost raw material, making the production less economical beneficial.</P><DIV class="third-level">2)1-Menthone Method[13]</DIV><P class="my-content">Fig.5 process of 1-Menthone Method</P><P class="my-content">Designed by Tatsuya and Yoshiro in 1974, this method requires nine steps. In this way, too many steps limit the industrialized production of citronellol. </P><P class="my-content">Although the principles of using pre-existed substances are clear and simple, these raw materials are only abundant in typical locations due to differentiated geological characteristics, plus the radical group that can be reduced in the molecule will influence the selective reduction in hydrogenation.</P><DIV class="third-level">3)Citral Hydrogenation [14][15]</DIV><P class="my-content">Fig.6 process of Citral Hydrogenation</P><P class="my-content">Currently, Citral is catalyzed by Raney nickel under the condition of 100℃ and (136398) kPa, together with the alcoholic environment to undergo hydrogenation thus producing citronellol. This method requires heavy metal as the catalysts and requires restrained reaction circumstances, thus making the process of production complicated.</P><P class="my-content">In conclusion, the widening gap between the increasing threat from mosquitoes and the unsatisfying development of anti-mosquito products reveals the urgent demand of an innocuous substance that effectively repels mosquitoes, and can be applied to mass production in low cost.</P><DIV class="first-level" id="a21">References</DIV><P class="my-content">
