Collaboration with CIEI-China
Our sister team CIEI-China needed to collect samples to test the salinity of kitchen waste for their project and asked if we can help. In May, our team members provided the kitchen waste from each oneâ€™s family, helping them collect more trash samples. Also, some of our team members, together with CIEI-China, asked the local residents from door to door and found the kitchen waste in the local community. Eventually, CIEI-China successfully collected enough trash samples for their project.
In order to check if our citronellol was really effective, in October, we conducted our outdoor experiments in the School of Pharmacy in Southern Medical University in Guangzhou. We invited the members of our dear sister team CIEI-China to do the experiments with us in order to gain more sets of data. Due to the experiments, each people got some mosquito bites. We felt really grateful to CIEI-China for helping us with the experiments, because it was awful to be bitten by the mosquitoes.
Collaboration with College Teams
BIT-China provided us the vector pSB1C3.
We joined in a WeChat group called Conference of China iGEMer Community, which is launched by Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University. We were motivated to communicate with other teams and learned a lot.
CGEM Summit
We believed that it is of great importance to communicate with other IGEM teams because we could broaden our horizon and get more inspiration of our own project. So, we, CIEI-Beijing, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit aiming to share our research and communicate with other about our own latest progress. We invited other three IGEM teams, HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou, RDFZ-China and BIT-China, and some experts to join in our forum.
In this summit, we shared our research with each other, listened to the suggestion from the experts, and developed a further understanding of the great importance and multiple applications of synthetic biology.  Thanks to IGEM, we became close friends with each other and we would work together to make the world a better place to live with biosynthesis technology!
