PdGES
PdGES, Phyla dulcis geraniol synthase (GES), is an enzyme which bolsters the production of geraniol. Through the MVA or DXP pathway, Geranyl Diphosphate（GPP）can be  produced by glucose. The function of PdGES is to convert GPP into geraniol. This enzyme is one of the essential proteins in our process, since it produces geraniol in the first place.

Optimization
In order to assure that PdGES ligate to the multiple cloning sites of the vector successfully, we avoid all the common restriction enzyme cutting sites （EcoR I, Xba I, Spe I, Pst I, BamH I, Bgl II, Hind III, Kpn I, Nco I, Nde I, Not I, Sal I, Xho I, Polymerase slippage site, Polymerase slippage site, Frameshift element, ribosome binding site）when the synthesis is being performed.
To make the parts established by genes satisfy the need of constructing the vector pSBIC3, we avoided the restriction enzyme cutting sites, which are EcoR Ⅰ, Xba I, Spe I, Pst I.
To ligate genes directly to the standard vector, we added the restriction enzyme cutting sites  of Xba Ⅰ and Spe Ⅰ to the upstream and downstream of target gene.

pUC57 vector
Introduction of pUC57:
pUC57 and it is a cloning vector with size of 2710 bp 2710 bp. The promoter of pUC57 is lac and the replicon is ColE1 origin and the resistance of pUC57 is the ampicillin in prokaryotic. In addition, the aerobic environment with 37 degree Celsius in LB medium is optimal condition for pUC57 cultivation. In our experiment, we got gene  PdGES and PcGES from pUC57 as our initial materials.

Amplification of PdGES
To obtain the target gene PdGES , by using the specific primers to clone the targeted gene, our team amplified the template----vector pUC57 with PdGES ---- through PCR.
The sequence of forward primer is: AAAAACAACTAATTATTCGAAGATGGCGAGCGCGCGTAG
The sequence of reverse primer is: AGGCGAATTAATTCGCGGCGCTTTACAGCAGCGGGGTAA
As shown is figure 1-3, the size of PdGES matches with the theoretical size of PdGES which is 1755 bp, The results proved that we had  successfully cloned the gene PdGES .

The left column is the marker, and the two strips on the right are PCR products of PdGES .
The sizes of the two strips are both about 2000 bp.
Construction of vectors
Construction of yeast expression vector pPIC9K
pPIC9K is a carrier for protein expression of in yeast of of 9276bp. The promoter of pPIC9K is AOX1 and the resistance of pPIC9K is the Ampicillin.
The sequences of common primer for pPIC9K:
5' sequencing primer is 5´-GACTGGTTCCAATTGACAAGC-3´
3' sequencing primer is 5´-GCAAATGGCATTCTGACATCC-3´
Fig. 1-4 The plasmid portfolio of pPIC9K
The vector pPIC9K used in our experiment doesn’t have the S part, because the S part is the secretion signal which can remove the protein we produce in the experiment. Since our purpose is to obtain the protein, we have to cut this part to make our experiment successful.
As shown in the diagram below, PdGES has been ligated to the yeast vector pPIC9K successfully. The process is achieved by digestion and ligation to BamHI and NotI.  Finally, we transformed the ligation product  into competent cell yeast GS115.
Fig. 1-5 Electrophoresis of PdGES -contained pPIC9K vector.
The left column is the marker and the strips on the right are the PCR products of ligation of PdGES.
Construction of E. Coli expression vector pET32a
pET32a is a carrier for the expression of protein in E.Coli of 5900bp. The promoter of pET32a is T7, which is a strong promotor that can express at any time, any cell under any circumstance. The resistance of pET32a is the Ampicillin.
The sequences of primer for pET32a:
5' sequencing primer is 5´-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3´
3' sequencing primer is 5´-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3´
Fig. 1-6 The plasmid portfolio of pET32a
We tried to ligate PdGES gene into pET32a vector, but after three trails, we failed to ligate the intracellular device in pET32a. The possible explanation is that the condition for ligation is not suitable or the sequence of this gene.
PcGES
PcGES, Pogostemon cablin geraniol synthase (GS1), is an also enzyme which bolsters the production of geraniol. Through the MVA or DXP pathway, Geranyl Diphosphate（GPP）can be  produced. The fuction of PcGES is to convert GPP to geraniol. PcGES functions the same as PdGES, the only difference is that they are from different species. By applying both GESs in our experiments, we can find out which one is more efficient by analyzing the efficiency of production.

we use the restriction endonuclease BamH I and Xho I to cut the E. Coli expression vector pET32a and make it ligated with HbOYE (1.2 kb), and the result has shown to be positive  through PCR.
Then we ligate the product with T4 vector for sequencing. Eventually, the product has been transformed into the competent cell E. Coli complement cell DH5α, and the result of sequencing is 100% matched.

The left column is the marker and the strips on the right are all the samples of combination of HbOYE and pPIC9K. According to the graph, the size is between 1000 bp and 2000 bp, so the result is positive.
Ligation of HbOYE with 2A and GES to pPIC9K vector and pET32a vector
To improve the efficiency of production while keeping the two proteins independent at the same time, we decide to combine OYE and GES together. It turns out that we choose 2A as a ‘bridge’ to link the two genes because the protein translated by 2A can be cut by certain enzymes automatically. 2A, known as CHYSEL polypeptides, contains the peptide bond to grow the peptide chain which helps to link two genes. The presence of the conserved CHYSEL residues in the peptides contributes to form a torsion which causes the peptide chain to be released later, and then the two genes can express in a cell separately. Furthermore, we employ two kinds of 2A, which are F2A and P2A. By doing so, we can compare the efficiencies of them and choose one which is more efficient.

HbOYE+2A
By using Net-PCR, we combined the HbOYE with 2A. 2A is a piece of peptide which can combine two genes together and be cut at 3’ prime end when the DNA is translated into mRNA. After being cut, the two genes can still perform their functions correctly in the latter steps. The picture of electrophoresis following shows the positive result of the combination. This product will be used in the final step of our experiment. Because of the function domain of GES is on the 3’ end，the 2A which can express 20 amino acids which may influence the function of GES protein, so we ligated OYE with 2A first, the ligate GES after 2A.

HbOYE+2A+PcGES
By using Net-PCR, we combined the previous product (HbOYE with 2A) and PcGES. The picture of electrophoresis following shows the positive result of the combination. This product is our final product of the whole experiments.

After ultrasonication, we used the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to detect our target protein (HbOYE+F2A+GES2 and HbOYE+P2A+GES2), and the result showed that we succesfully produced our the recombinant protein (Fig ).
To make sure the expression of SmCPSI goes successfully with our instruments, we performed sonication on E.Coli cells and smashed them. Then we collect the supernatant fluid and protein to conduct the SDS protein electrophoresis. The size of HbOYE is about 1.2 Kb, and the encoding protein is about 44 KD; The size of PcGES is about 1.8 Kb, and the encoding protein is about 67 KD. There are about 22 KD fusion tags  on the carrier skeleton of pET32a on the end N of HbOYE. F2A and P2A can cut the fusion protein into two parts and the each new protein will be about 67 KD which cannot be separated by electropherosis. The result of SDS-PAGE shows that the protein can be expressd fluently through our instruments with the induction of IPTG. The positive result meets our expectation.

Next we committed Western Blot method to detect the exitence of HIS tag by using HIS antibody. The results showed that, under both situations, bacteria successfully expressed our recombinant protein.

Amplification of ScOYE
carrier-pUC57
The information of this vector is the same as PdGES (above 1.2.1.1)
verification of ScOYE product
To obtain the target gene ScOYE , by using the specific primers to clone the targeted gene,we amplified the template is the vector pUC57 with HbOYE through PCR.
The sequence of forward primer is:AAAAACAACTAATTATTCGAAGATGCCATTTGTTAAGGACT
The sequence of reverse primer is: AGGCGAATTAATTCGCGGCGCTTTTTTGTCCCAACCG
As shown is figure 1-3, we successfully cloned gene ScOYE , because the size of ScOYE shown on the picture matches with the theoretical size of ScOYE which is 1203 bp.
Fig. 4-1 The picture of electrophoresis of ScOYE.
The left column is the marker, and the two strips on the right are PCR products of ScOYE.
The sizes of the two strips are more than 1000 bp.
Ligation of ScOYE in E.Coli
Ligation of ScOYE fragment to pET32a vector
We uses the restriction endonuclease BamH I and Xho I to cut the E. Coli expression vector pET32a and make it ligated with ScOYE, and the result has been shown positive through PCR.
Then we ligate the product with T4 vector for sequencing. Eventually, the product has been transformed into the E. Coli competent cell DH5α, and the result of sequencing is 100% matched.

Ligation of ScOYE in Yeast
We plan to striction endonuclease BamH I and NotI to cut the yeast expression vector PIC9K and make it ligated with ScOYE. Then combined the previous product (ScOYE with 2A) and PcGES. but the time is limitated.

Results of the Experiment to Test Citronellol’s Effect in Repelling Mosquitoes
To test the repellent effectiveness of citronellol, we chose the common and safe Aedes（Stegomyia）albopictus as subject. We bought bottled citronellol from 3 companies (each sample was tested independently). We used citronellol with concentration ranging from 95%-99% for test outdoors, but the odor was too strong for people to accept. The indoor mosquito repelling experiment used the following 4 solutions:
Citronellol 60%; glycerin 30%; ddH2O 10%
Citronellol 40%; glycerin 30%; ddH2O 30%
Citronellol 20%; glycerin 30%; ddH2O 50%
Citronellol 10%; glycerin 30%; ddH2O 60%
1.Applying on Hands:
Apply the Solution evenly to a circular area with a diameter of 4cm on the back of left hand and record the number of bites on the area. Take the back of the right hand as control. Stop the experiment when the effect of repellent decreases. Results showed direct proportional relationships between the concentration of citronellol and the time of repelling. The highest concentration of citronellol was 60%, the 100% protection time was 2.5h. The lowest concentration of citronellol was 10%, the 100% protection time was 2h. The results demonstrated citronellol as a highly effective mosquito repellent. The protection effectiveness does not have a significant difference when the concentration of citronellol is 20% or 10%. If the concentration of citronellol exceeds 20%, the effective protection time increases as the concentration of citronellol increases. The odor is more acceptable when the concentration of citronellol is lower.

Treatment: number of bites when solution composed of Citronellol 60%, glycerin 30% and ddH2 O 10% is applied to the left hand. The number of bites is an average of 3 kinds of purchased citronellol. The protection equals: (bites on control – bites on treatment)/ (bites on control) *100%.
Fuming Experiments:
Prepare 2 cubic mosquito cages. Separate each mosquito cage with a piece of gauze. Mosquitoes were put in the left part of the cage and citronellol fume was put in the right part. Put both hands in the left part of the cube without citronellol fume. Then record the number of times mosquitoes stayed on or collided with the gauze in 5min. Repeat each set of experiment 3 times. Record the average number of bites and calculate the protection rate: (number of mosquitoes without citronellol fume – the number with citronellol fume)/ (number without citronellol fume) * 100%. The results showed different concentration of citronellol did not have apparent distinctions; whether there was citronellol fume or not influence on the number of mosquitoes staying on the gauze. It was natural for mosquitoes to stay on the gauze as there had been no disturbance. We learnt from Dr. Xu that citronellol only works as a repellent when in contact with skin. This is consistent with the experimental results. Citronellol blocks the scent that attracts mosquitoes. Therefore, if citronellol is not applied on skin, it can be reasonably hypothesized that mosquitoes will still be attracted.
