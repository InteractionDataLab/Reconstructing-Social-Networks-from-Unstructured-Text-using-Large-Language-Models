When we started our project in January, 2017, ITCCC taught us knowledge of synthetic biology. The course materials were prepared by our teachers. Right after we finished our lesson, we started our brainstorming. Meanwhile, Dr. Wang taught us the lab rules and some basic experiments in the lab of China Agricultural University. We determined our research topic and began to do our experiments in June.
