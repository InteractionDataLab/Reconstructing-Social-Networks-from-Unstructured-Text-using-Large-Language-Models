Here we are ---- the one and the only CIEI-BJ (China International Education Institute - Beijing), building up with fourteen creative youthful beings and advisers. We gathered together with abundant passion and superhero-like sense of mission in heart. As high schoolers, we know of our disadvantage in knowledge clearly, and we convert into the motivation of forging ahead and the ability of constantly jumping out of the box. In another word, we are the green hands with limitless minds. Fortunate like us, we’ve always gotten our wonderful advisors beside us. 2017, CIEI-BJ is ready for the journey, joy and sorrow, awaiting in front.
It's 2017, we are trying our best for this competition as our estimable experience, best wishes to us and other teams and great thanks to our teachers.
