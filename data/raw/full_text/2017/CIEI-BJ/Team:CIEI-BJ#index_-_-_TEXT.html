Repel the mosquitos, without harm left
Mosquitos are capable of transmitting severe diseases to human beings (e.g. malaria, yellow fever, and microcephaly, etc). Many countries have suffered/are suffering from disasters caused by these epidemics, and there were roughly 1.5 million people killed in 2016. Even worse, most mosquito repellents currently used contain DEET which is detrimental to both humans and environment. One of the most significant concern during production is to ensure that neither pollution nor toxin will be released. Thus, our team, CIEI-BJ, aimed to design a biosynthesis pathway to produce a special substance, Citronellol, which is nontoxic to human beings, environmental friendly, and can repel mosquitoes effectively. In this research, we successfully transferred geraniol synthase gene (GES) and old yellow enzyme gene (OYE) which is connected by the link gene 2A intoE.coli and yeast, and realized direct production of citronellol from glucose. Based on the human body test, we proved the effectiveness of citronellol in mosquito repelling. Through this method, we can produce citronellol massively with high efficiency, low cost and zero toxic byproducts, which will benefit our health, society and environment a lot.
