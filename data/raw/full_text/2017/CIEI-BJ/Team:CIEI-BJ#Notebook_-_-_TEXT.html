Feb. 2017
-We learnt some basic concepts of synthetic biology, and the safety rule of laboratory.
-We practiced some basic experimental operation under guidance of Dr. Wang from China Agriculture University.
-We read a lot of literatures, brainstormed and came up with the topic of our project.
Mar. 2017
-After massive literature study and discussion, our group members agreed to design a toxic-free product which could repel mosquitos effectively.
-We visited Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and consulted with the professors about our experimental plans.
-We decided the research plan which is most possible to lead us a successful accomplishment of our research objective.
-We presented our ideas to some teachers from Institute of Agriculture, and gained several useful advice.
Apr. 2017
-Based on group communication, our project aimed on citronellol, because the literature study gave us a clear clue about the incomparable advantages of citronellol in the perspective of repelling mosquitoes.
-We searched more documents about citronello and its effects on mosquito repelling. Finally we found out that OYE and GES are the two key enzymes in citronellol production pathway.
-We designed our unique genetic circuits and selected the appropriate vector which can result in a successful expression of our target proteins.
-We cloned both gene OYE and GES after the primers was designed.
May. 2017
-We visited the College of Life Science in Peking University and asked Prof. Liu for some advice on our plan.
-We Found and chose the appropriate vector for our project which can express our target protein in yeast.
-We Found and chose the appropriate vector for our project which can express our target protein in E.coli.
Jun. 2017
-We kept searching for literature and improved our research plan based on Prof. Liuâ€™s suggestions.
-We combined GES and OYE with 2A through PCR successfully.
Jul.2017
Week 1-2
-We visited the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and discussed our project with the experts there.
-We learnt that diseases caused by mosquitos are prevailing all over the world and there is an urgent need for a more effective repellent product.
Week 3-4
-We started to write our background, experiment designs, and experiment protocols.
-We ligated GES and OYE on the yeast expression vector pPIC9K separately, and on E. Coli expression vector pPET32a separately as well.
Aug.2017
Week 1-2
-We designed the questionnaires and set up a public account on WeChat to disseminate our projects.
-We combined the two yeast expression vectors (pPIC9K) together to form the combination of GES+2A+OYE
Week 3-4
-We furthered our experiments under guidance of Dr. Song to build up other vectors.
-We started our Wiki designing.
Sept. 2017
-We transformed the different vectors into yeast and E. Coli separately.
-We developed yeast and E. Coli under different conditions to maximize the efficiencies.
Oct. 2017
-We purified our final product citronello through bio-chemical methods for the further experiments.
-We designed and conducted human body test for the effectiveness of citronello, to prove the usefulness of our product.
-We accomplished the majority of the experiments in laboratory and began to analyze our results.
-To search for concrete suggestions, we also held a communicating symposium, inviting teachers in the genetic engineering field to provide some suggestions for improvement of the our experiments and inspire us with some creative ideas.
Nov. 2017
-We finalized everything related to the project and prepared for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
