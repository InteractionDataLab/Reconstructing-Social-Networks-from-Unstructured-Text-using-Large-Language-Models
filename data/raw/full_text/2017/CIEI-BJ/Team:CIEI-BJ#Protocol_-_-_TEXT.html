Protocol
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
1. Mix 0.25 gram of agarose with 25 grams of TAE solution, and the heat the mixture until the agarose fully dissolves.
2. Pour the mixture into a square mould. Plug in the comb, and wait until the mixture solidifies.
3. Put the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus, and the fill it with TAE solution.
4. Add 1 μL of loading buffer and 1 μL of SYBR Gold into 5 μL of sample.
5. Add the sample and marker into the gel. Connect two sides with the electric source. Wait for 30-40 minutes.
6. Take out the gel, and observe the result under UV transillumination.
Agarose Gel Electroporation of Pichia pastoris
1.Prepare the cells
(1)Prepare 5mL Pichia pastoris in a conical and oscillate it on the oscillating table for several hours.
(2)Put 0.5mL of the Pichia pastoris in the conical. Let it grow to an OD600=1.3-1.5.
(3)Centrifuge the Pichia pastoris at 1500 ×g for 5 minutes in a 4℃ condition. Add 500 mL sterile water (which is previously stored in the ice).
(4)Centrifuge the Pichia pastoris then add 250 mL ice-cold water.
(5)Centrifuge the cells then add 50 mL 1M ice-cold sorbitol.
(6)Centrifuge the cells then add 1.5 mL 1M ice-cold sorbitol.
2.Transformation
(1)Put 80 L Pichia pastoris cells we prepared in previous process in a centrifugal tube and add 5-20 μg of linearized DNA (which we got from the previous experiment)
(2)Transfer the mixture in a particular tube prepared for the eletroporator. Use the electroporator to transform the DNA in the Pichia pastoris.
