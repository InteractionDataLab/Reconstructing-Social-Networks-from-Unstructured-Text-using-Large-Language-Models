Geranyl diphosphate（GPP）can be  produced through MVA or DXP pathway. Then GES can  help to convert GPP to  geraniol.. Geraniol will be reduced to citronellol as OYE adds hydrogen to geraniol. Researchers tried to improve efficiency of citronellol production through a MVA pathway in which GES can be expressed in engineered E. Coli  to produce geraniol [1]. Some other researches also  showed that certain types of OYE (OYE1 from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis [2][3], OYE2 and OYE3 from S. cerevisiae [3][4], CmOYE from Candida macedoniensis [5] and bacterial OYE homologues YqjM from Bacillus subtilis) can lead to different reaction rates  for geraniol to be reduced   into citronellol [6]. Zeng’s research showed that differen OYE gene in E.coli and yeast can induce different production of citronellol [7] [8].
Our aim is to work out a pathway to take glucose as the substrate to directly produce citronellol. We will also try different composition of citronellol-based mosquito repellent to make our product has enjoyable scent and repels mosquitoes effectively. We would like to make a mosquito repellent safe enough  even for babies. We will optimize the labor and resource cost to extract citronellol and make E. coli or yeast into a factory for massive production of  citronellol, a harmless mosquito repellent. Therefore, we designed expression systems in both E. coli and yeast.
New Design from CIEI-BJ
After mass investigation, we, CIEI-BJ, designed a brand new citronellol production procedure.
The graph below shows this process.
Fig.1 General process of synthesizing citronellol
Based on previous researches, citronellol can be produced with the catalyst old yellow enzyme (OYE) from geraniol[9], which can be synthesized by using modified E.coli with the raw material of glucose[10] . Geraniol synthase (GES) is the enzyme identified to be responsible for synthesizing geraniol. [11] In order to have a continuous production process for citronellol, we innovatively combined these two steps and utilized E.coli as the carrier for undergoing the process. We used glucose as the substrate to produce citronellol with the intermediate product geraniol. During this procedure, GES and OYE are the most important factors to determine the production of citronellol.
Thus we designed the following genetic circuits to produce the two enzymes GES and OYE, for the E.coli based automatic citronellol synthesis.

In our experiment, we adopted two plasmids for two separated pathways. In the first pathway, Isopropyl β-D-Thiogalactoside (IPTG) provides activation for lacI operator during translation. 2A functions as separating GES gene and OYE gene, which can be automatic removed by cell itself. thus two independent proteins can be synthesized properly. [12]
In the second pathway, we construct two plasmids one contain GES gene, and the other  contain OYE genes, the two plasmids can be transformed to one cell.
