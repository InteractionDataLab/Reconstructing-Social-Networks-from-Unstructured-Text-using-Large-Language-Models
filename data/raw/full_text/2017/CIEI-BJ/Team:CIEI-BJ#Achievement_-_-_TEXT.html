[Collaborations]
We communicated with some college iGEM teams through the online community. We, CIEI-Beijing, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit, invited some other iGEM teams  and shared our research progress with each other..

Gold Medal
[Human practice Gold]
In order to know people’s expectations on  mosquito repellent products i we designed a questionnaire, and did surveys   online and offline.
We, CIEI-BJ, together with our sister team CIEI-China, set up CGEM Summit and invited another iGEM teams (HFLS-H2Z-HangZhou,RDFZ-China, BIT-China), predecessors iGEMers from Qinghua university , and four professors to our forum, aiming to share our research with other teams and communicate with them about thelatest progress in the project. ### Our team made several public speeches about our project in schools and at the corner of Xidan road in Beijing.

[BioBrick Part]
BBa_K613010: We successfully connected HbOYE and T7 terminator to the part BBa_K613010 and also connected ScOYE and T7 terminator to the part BBa_K613010, which made T7 promoter and lac operator regulate expression of these genes together.
