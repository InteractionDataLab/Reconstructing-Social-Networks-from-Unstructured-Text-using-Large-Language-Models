        A major requisite of cyano-cell factories, according to expert's opinion, is that they  must be able to produce in a stable fashion under industrial conditions. A recent quantitative analysis of the various ways to convert the energy of photons to chemical bonds has revealed that the direct utilization of sunlight is the most efficient [1]. This however means that cells will be exposed to diurnal regimes in which they will inevitably be exposed to periods of darkness. Our goal here is to achieve the first photoautotrophic cell factories that are able to stably produce fumarate around the clock.

        leads to a stable cell factory that produces fumarate as it grows during the day. Nevertheless, at night our cells do not produce fumarate, since at night, they don't grow. To overcome this challenge, we have taken a systems biology approach which interweaves theory, modeling, and experimentation to implement stable nighttime production of fumarate. We theorized that we can redirect the nighttime flux towards fumarate production by removing a competing pathway via knockout of the
        <I>

        gene.  Additionally, we also took inspiration from nature and speculated that the incorporation of the glyoxylate shunt would further increase our nighttime production of fumarate. Our models corroborate these predictions, however, they also suggest that the stability of the glyoxylate shunt is sensitive to the timing of when the shunt is turned on (i.e. expressed). We therefore took a robust approach to incorporate the glyoxylate shunt enzymes under ideal expression conditions.

         Why produce during day and night?

         Our cyano-cell factory must be able to stably grow and produce under industrial conditions. At the industrial scale,
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         and other cyanobacteria are often grown in large outdoor ponds or in greenhouses [2], where natural solar radiation is the primary source of light. This means that the cultures are subject to an oscillating light-dark cycle. Therefore, we aim to make a cyanobacterial cell factory that is able to produce fumarate in a stable fashion during, not only the day, but also the night.
         
         We mimicked industrial conditions in the lab by tailoring commercially available photobioreactors (MC1000-OD, PSI, Czech Republic) to be capable of simulating dynamic white light regimes. This involved developing new algorithms to incorporate the on-line measurements (e.g. OD
         <SUB>

         ) with the desired oscillatory light intensity patterns, which then had to be coded into the in-house

In combination, these new developments allow us to use lab-scale photobioreactors to mimic industrial settings operating at high cell densities in which cells perceive fluctuating light intensities on top of the sinusoidal light regimes inherent to day-night cycles. This effort, albeit time consuming and with little application of synthetic biology methods, was crucial to ensure the connectivity of our metabolic engineering strategies to the

         Why is stability an issue?
        </P><P>
         Stable production at the industrial scale is a challenge of biotechnology. Production rates are often not sustained and will diminish throughout the cultivation. Furthermore, maximal production rates cannot be reached again by the same culture, even with the addition of fresh medium. This is due to the phenomena of strain instability [3].
         
         This generalized phenomenon can be easily understood in the light of evolution theory, Darwinian selection and population dynamics. By introducing heterologous production pathways, cellular resources are forcibly diverted towards an extraneous product, and away from anabolic processes (i.e. growth). Cells which then lose the ability to produce the product are able to grow faster and eventually take over the population based on simple Darwinian selection, resulting in the irreversible loss of production [4].
         
         Promising solutions to strain instability can involve the alignment of production of the desired compound with the fitness of the cell, i.e. the cell must produce in order to grow. One method for stable production is to knock-out genes whose proteins recycle anabolic byproducts [5].

          Experts in biotechnology
         </A>
         have indicated to us at the onset of this project that the process unpredictability that emerges from the instability of engineered strains in production settings is one of the major technical hurdles of the field [6]. This occurs because most commonly used metabolic engineering approaches make products in direct competition with biomass formation, which imposes high fitness burdens on production strains. This ultimately leads to a rapid appearance of suppressor mutations, for instance in the form of insertions or deletions, that impair the culture's ability to form product [7][8]. So called
         <B><I>
           growth-coupled production
          </I></B>
         (i.e. obligate coupling of the synthesis of specific target products with bacterial growth) can help stabilize production traits. When the formation of product and biomass are aligned, non-producing mutants that emerge spontaneously are outcompeted by the fitter producing strains according to Darwinian selection principles [9]. The theoretical framework behind the engineering of growth-coupled strategies has thus far been underpinned by the same principle - linking a product-forming pathway to the capacity of the cell to regenerate energy and/or redox co-factors. This principle has been proposed for photoautotrophs but never successfully implemented in the laboratory [10]. The cause behind this has to do with the plasticity conferred by all the alternative electron flows surrounding the photosystems I and II, which makes it very difficult to achieve the desired strict coupling. However, recent advancements in the designing of metabolic engineering growth-coupled production strategies may bring the solution to this hurdle.

          2015 Amsterdam iGEM team
         </A>
         has pioneered the development of a method to design growth-coupled strategies based on a completely different principle. Instead of using energy or redox regeneration, this is now based on the direct stoichiometric coupling of pathways uniquely responsible for the formation of biomass precursors to the production of target compounds. This is achieved through the deletion of the native metabolic route(s) that cells have to reintroduce side-products of anabolism, leading to their accumulation, and hence, ensuring their growth-coupled production.
         
         This concept has been developed into an algorithm to 'Find Reactions Usable In Tapping Side-products' - FRUITS. By analyzing existing genome-scale metabolic models, it identifies anabolic side-products that can be coupled to cell growth by the deletion of their re-utilization pathway(s). This pipeline is freely-available at

         . When applied to
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         growing under photoautotrophic conditions, FRUITS predicts that nine compounds can be coupled to growth, of which one is fumarate.
         
         Prediction is that during growth, so in the light (or during the day in an industrial setting), fumarate is produced as a by-product of specific anabolic reactions within purine and urea metabolism and then re-assimilated through the TCA cycle via the activity of
         <I>
          fumC
         </I>
         (fumarase). If the only fumarate assimilation pathway present is removed, by the engineering of a
         <I>
          fumC
         </I>
         deletion strain, FRUITS predicts that fumarate will be accumulated (fig.2.1). While the precise localization of fumarate is not important in silico, in our

         While undoubtedly promising (!) these initial growth experiments do not assure that biomass and fumarate formation are strictly aligned. The strong stoichiometric coupling which we are striving to engineer implies that at different growth rates one would expect a linearly proportional change in the biomass specific production rate.

The results obtained indicate that fumarate productivity is indeed proportional to cell growth rate, implying that both physiological traits are strongly coupled as here desired. Furthermore, we compared the linear fit between fumarate productivity and growth rate based on our experiment, with the outcome of the simulations using FBA on the metabolic network reconstruction of
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         . It is important to highlight that we did not in anyway tweak the modeling parameters, which were taken directly from the original report [11]. Still, both fits match strikingly well, corroborating that indeed the hypothesis that fumarate production and growth rate are aligned in the

This indicates that irrespective of the growth rate, as long as cells are illuminated, the fumarate yield on biomass is constant. This result also support theoretical predictions, which state that fumarate production is only affected by environmental conditions to the extent that the latter affect growth. In other words, that fumarate production is

As explained above, the root of the instability comes from Darwinian selection for fitter strains. When using classical metabolic engineering strategies, the fitter strains are the non-producing ones; When using our new growth-coupled strategy, it should be the producing ones. Conditions in which cells are under a strong selection pressure for fastest growth and in which the propagation bottlenecks are smallest, are predicted to result in the fastest drops in productivity [12]. Such conditions, while maintaining the total population size relatively constant, are best met under turbidostat cultivation [13], and so these provide the harshest test ground to assess the stability of production strains.

         strain under turbidostat regimes operated at non-light limiting conditions at maximal growth rate extending for over 3 weeks.

As a control, we compared how a

          Synechocystis

         strain that was engineered using classical approaches to produce lactate [14] fairs under the same conditions. Lactate production in this strain was achieved by the heterologous expression of lactate dehydrogenase from Lactococcus lactis, yielding an initial carbon partitioning as the one here reported for fumarate. As theory would dictate, lactate production was lost within 5 to 10 days for this strain (fig.2.4B). This result reinforces the stringency with which this regimes selects for fitter cells, which when using our engineering method, means the producing ones.

         Turbidostat cultivation

         We studied the genetic stability of our strains in populations maintained under turbidostat model [13]. In this continuous cultivation method, microbial populations are kept at a fixed biomass density by diluting the culture with fresh medium at the same rate as the populations grows. This feedback loop applies a strong selection pressure on cells to grow at the maximal specific growth rate. The turbidostat setup used in this experiment is based on a modified Multi-Cultivator, with additional pumps (Reglo ICC, ISMATEC, Germany) transferring fresh medium to the cultures, and subsequently, to a waste container (i.e. as in a classical chemostat). The &quot;pycultivator&quot; software package that controls the Multi-Cultivator and adjunct hardware, additionally sets the pumps to dilute the cultures if the selected OD

         How to stably produce fumarate during the night?
        </P><P>
         Experts in the field of biotechnology explained to us that production with photoautotrophs is to the best of their knowledge not been explored. After all the claim to fame of these organisms is precisely their ability to use the energy of light. Nonetheless, a significant part of the energy from light captured during the day is used by these organisms to make storage compounds such as glycogen [24] or poly-hydroxybutyrate[25]. If we explore the production possibilities of fumarate in
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         during the night, we face a challenge. As
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         does not grow without sunlight, the growth coupled production strategy of fumarate is not possible during the night. Thus, we expect no growth coupled fumarate production. But is there another strategy in which we can exploit the night to produce fumarate?
        </P><P>
         In order to survive the night,
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         produces energy by catabolizing its glycogen storage [24]. The TCA cycle is often associated with this process as it provides the electron carriers for ATP production via respiration.  As fumarate is an intermediate metabolite in the TCA cycle, increasing the carbon flux through the TCA cycle could be exploited to increase fumarate production during the night.
        </P><P>
         An unexpected challenge, probably quite unique to photoautotrophs, that emerged is that flux measurements experimentally determined that
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         does not use the TCA cycle at night as anticipated, but as rather evolved to prefer the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) [15]. During the night, the PPP can also act as an additional electron carrier producing pathway, which is preferred over the TCA cycle in
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         for this function [15], potentially because it does not release so much of the energy already stored in the carbon bonds. End-product of PPP will be a pentose (5 carbon skeleton), while the TCA cycle will produce CO
         <SUB>
          2
         </SUB>
         which was so costly to fix in the first place!
        </P><P>
         To increase the flux through the TCA cycle, we took a modeling approach, which predicted that we could increase flux towards the TCA cycle by deletion of the
         <I>
          zwf
         </I>
         gene, which codes for  Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase. It catalyzes the first step in the PPP. By removing the PPP, our
         <A class="in-text-link" href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Amsterdam/Model#ppp" target="_blank">
          model
         </A>
         predicts that the cell is then forced to have a higher flux towards the TCA cycle to reconcile the loss in reducing equivalent production. When combined with the
         <I>
          fumC
         </I>
         deletion, this will lead to an increased production of fumarate, which we have tested (and confirmed) in a photonfluxostat experiment.

           PCR confirmation of gene deletions on Wild Type and Δ fumC background of Δ zwf and Δ fumC Δ zwf. A clean knockout gives a single DNA band at 2202 bp, while for wild type (WT) this is 3.430 bp. As a positive control (C+) the knockout plasmid was used and as negative control (C-) the mazF plasmid was used. Most importantly the Wild Type (WT) gene is not present anymore in our strains, which implies that the strains are fully segregated knock outs.

         It must be noted however, that nighttime fumarate production can be perceived as finite since it relies on the glycogen storages that were built up during the day. The reported QP is calculated by looking at the night as whole. Although the comparisons between the strains are still valid, it is important to understand that QP is not necessarily constant throughout the night as it depends on the dynamics of glycogen catabolism.

         strain produced fumarate during the night, and albeit not much, still it directly contradicts our model predictions. Even if we do not correct for OD, there is an increase in fumarate concentration during the night (fig. 2.8), further supporting that the

         indeed (unexpectedly) produces fumarate during the night. This can be easily explained by one of the pitfalls of constraint based analysis techniques such as the ones we used - they assume optimality. The dynamic flux balance analysis predicts that using the PPP at night is preferred over the TCA, and hence, the corresponding flux distributions deduced do not lead to fumarate production. The thing is that Life does not always have to conform to the optimality principles that underlie the modeling, as there might be other factors which are not captured in the model at play. For instance, one could speculate that cells adopt an anticipatory behavior during the night and want to make some amino acids that are derived from TCA intermediates. That could explain why a residual flux towards the TCA could still be beneficial. One thing remains clear, though - deletion of the
         <I>

         </I>
         gene combined with the
         <I>

         </I>
         drastically increases fumarate production in the dark - nearly 3 fold! This also opens up possibilities for the production of other TCA cycle intermediates at night with

          Many microorganisms express a glyoxylate shunt. The glyoxylate shunt consists of two enzymes which are not natively present in
          <I>
           Synechocystis
          </I>
          : isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS). The first enzyme, ICL, catalyzes the reaction of isocitrate into glyoxylate and succinate, where succinate can then be consumed by succinate dehydrogenase to produce fumarate and FADPH2. As for glyoxylate, this compound is then consumed by MS, along with acetyl-CoA, to make malate. Malate is then converted to oxaloacetate by malate dehydrogenase, yielding NADPH (fig. 2.11).

This would potentially align fumarate production with an increase in fitness during the night, providing the type of positive selection pressure, which could be used to stabilize the expression of this heterologous pathway in a production strain as advised by

         . However, timing the activation of this pathway turned out to be of the essence when engineering a stable strain. This led us to the construction of the first fully-segregated (i.e all copies of the chromosome have the same allele) promoter library in a polyploid organism such as the cyanobacterium we work with (

        </P><P>
         We found that the glyoxylate shunt must be well timed: it cannot be active during the day, as the glyoxylate shunt will draw carbon from more prefered pathways. We are thus faced with another challenge: how do we time the expression of the glyoxylate shunt such that the cell has a fitness advantage, while partitioning more carbon to fumarate synthesis? Clearly, only expressing the glyoxylate shunt during the night with the right expression levels is hard. The expression level and timing of a gene is, at the very least, partially regulated through its promoter. That is why we aim to look for a promoter with the right expression pattern for the shunt genes to be activate only in the night. Photoreceptor-based transcriptional circuits could at a first glance be suitable control systems. However, the delays between transcriptional activation (or repression) and the actual increase (or drop) in enzyme levels can be many hours depending for instance on protein stability. Such delay could be sufficient to remove the competitive edge of harboring the genes encoding the shunt, and therefore, rendering it phenotypically unstable.
         <I>
           Synechocystis
          </I>
          harbors circadian clocks with periods close to 24 h [18]. Chances are, that there already is a promoter present in its chromosome with the right expression levels at the right time for our glyoxylate shunt enzymes. These cellular clocks allow organisms to anticipate the environmental cycles of day and night by synchronizing circadian rhythms with the rising and setting of the sun. The rhythms originate from the oscillator components of circadian clocks and control global gene expression and various cellular processes, hinting at the presence of an appropriate promoter for our shunt genes. To express the glyoxylate shunt only during the night and with the right expression levels, we aim to use what nature has to offer and make a glyoxylate shunt promoter library.

          Or come up with a new method to do it.
         </LI></UL><P>
         We chose the latter and decided to develop a method to create a fully segregated (promoter) libraries in polyploid organisms.
         
          The strategy we developed employs the
          <A class="in-text-link" href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Amsterdam/Method" target="_blank">
           markerless method
          </A>
          that facilitates the selection for fully segregated colonies. This procedure is based on the negative selection method using the toxic gene
          <I>
           mazF
          </I>
          [20]. The
          <I>
           mazF
          </I>
          gene is an endoribonuclease that is regulated by a nickel-induced element (NIE) [21], killing the cells upon exposure to elevated concentrations of nickel. The
          <I>
           mazF
          </I>
          cassette needs to be introduced into the neutral site
          <I>
           slr0168
          </I>
          of the
          <I>
           Synechocystis
          </I>
          genome, enabling the introduction of the glyoxylate shunt into the neutral site at later time points, replacing the
          <I>
           mazF
          </I>
          cassette itself. With this selection method, complete segregation of the glyoxylate shunt in the genome can be tested simply by adding nickel - if the colony is not fully segregated, even if there is only one copy of the
          <I>
           mazF
          </I>
          -cassette in the genome, the cell will be killed upon exposure to nickel! However, when a colony is fully segregated, and all the
          <I>
           mazF
          </I>
          cassettes are replaced by glyoxylate shunt genes, the colony remains unharmed. Furthermore, we wanted the glyoxylate shunt promoter library to represent the entire genome (i.e. as many colonies as possible to reach a probability of having all the positions in the chromosome in the library at least once approaching 100%). To expand the library, we allowed the cells time to segregate before exposing them to nickel, as cells often shift towards full segregation over time [22].  A positive selection marker was used to push cells towards full segregation. However, high amounts of antibiotics might hamper cell growth and thereby slow down segregation. Studying the segregation dynamics, we found the sweet-spot between antibiotic concentration and the timing before exposing cells to nickel: after transformation (day 0), cells were supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) on day 1 and nickel 20 μM on day 4 (fig. 2.14).
          
           Using our newly developed method, we created the first fully segregated library representing the entire genome (99.9% confidence) of
           <I>
            Synechocystis
           </I>
           upstream of the glyoxylate shunt genes. What is more; the library is now ready to be tested. The beauty of the glyoxylate shunt promoter library approach lies in the fact that expressing the shunt at both the appropriate time and level increases fitness. Therefore, we can now easily select the ideal promoter using long term cultivations and letting Darwinian selection do the rest. The promoter that expresses the shunt the most optimally will be the one that grows the fastest, outcompeting the rest of the population. This will also be the best fumarate producer, which will eventually be used to further increase the nighttime fumarate production.

         Conclusion
        </P><P>
         Using the genome-scale metabolic model, we found that the glyoxylate shunt can increase the growth rate of our fumarate producing strain, but only under specific conditions: (i) it cannot be active during the day, as this will result in a decrease in fitness, and (ii) the expression of glyoxylate shunt enzymes need to be at the right levels. In order to find a promoter with the right expression characteristics for the glyoxylate shunt, we developed a method to create a fully segregated promoter library in polyploid organisms, such as our own cyanobacterium
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         . Using our own developed method, we created the first fully segregated library representing the entire genome (99.9% confidence) of
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         upstream of the glyoxylate shunt genes. This library is now ready to be tested to further increase nighttime fumarate production.

         Construction of the glyoxylate shunt genes in a plasmid

         The glyoxylate shunt genes are derived from

          Chlorogloeopsis fritschii
         </I>
         PCC 9212 and are obtained from the Bryant Lab in a plasmid called pAQ1Ex_cpc_MS-ICL_Sp [23]. To get both genes expressed under the same promoter, the glyoxylate shunt will be placed in a plasmid (pFLXN-h1h2-rbs-yfp-0168; obtained from MMP) that contains a ribosomal binding site (rbs) in front of each gene and a BglII restriction site where the genomic DNA fragments will be inserted. To push segregation and to select in

         , a kanamycin (Kan) resistance cassette was introduced in the plasmid.
        </P><P>
         Both plasmids were digested with NcoI and BamHI (Thermo Scientific FastDigest), placed on a 1% agarose gel, cut out and purified (Qiagen PCR/gel purification kit). Subsequently, the insert (MS-ICL) was ligated in the vector (pFLXN-h1h2-rbs), replacing the YFP fragment using T4 ligase and transformed to DH5alpha competent cells. Colonies were confirmed with colony PCR using primers h2_down_rv and h1_up_fw. The confirmed colonies were inoculated in LB (+50 μg/mL Kan), after which the plasmid, now called pFLXN-h1h2-rbs-MS-ICL (fig. 2.15), was extracted and sequence confirmed by Macrogen Europe (the Netherlands).

         ~5) and purified using RNAse. Then, the purified genomic DNA was digested with Sau3AI (Thermo Scientific FastDigest), yielding fragments ranging from 100-1000 bp. These fragments will be referred to as the inserts.
         
          To open pFLXN-h1h2-rbs-MS-ICL, enabling it to integrate the inserts, the plasmid was digested with BglII which is compatible with Sau3AI (Thermo Scientific FastDigest; incubated for 3 hours, added Phosphatase after 1.5 hour to prevent self ligation).
          
           Next, the insert was ligated in the vector using a ligation ratio of 1:7 (v:i) and transformed into Dh5-Alpha Competent  E. coli cells (MCLAB) multiple times, yielding it total over 100,000 positive colonies. This led to a probability of 99.9% that any fragment in the genome will occur at least once in the library.
