A hugh aspect of science is not informing other scientist, but informing the public about the beauty, possibilities and risks. Due to this, we were driven to tell our story to others. The conversations we had with people outside of the scientific world were very interesting. We learned a lot from their opinions about for example bacteria, environmental change and genetically modified organsims. If everyone we reached was unique, we told our story about saving the world with our Cyanobacteria to over 3 milion people!
