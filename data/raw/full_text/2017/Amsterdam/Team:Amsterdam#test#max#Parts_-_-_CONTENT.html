        Each year, every team competing in the iGEM competition contributes to the iGEM Parts Registry. This growing collection of genetic parts can be mixed and matched to build synthetic biology devices and systems. During our project, we worked with tens of constructs and chose the two most interesting (and promising) genes to turn into BioBricks. We have designed two versatile Basic Parts that have the potential to be used beyond the scope of our project.

        Introduction
       </P><P class="summary-text" id="underheader">
        There is increasing interest from researchers and companies in the potential of cyanobacteria as green cell-factories to produce valuable compounds and contribute to a so called ‘biobased economy’. Such photosynthetic cell-factories are capable of producing directly from CO
        <SUB>
         2
        </SUB>
        using the energy of (sun)light. However, it is only the compound that is excreted from the cells that is readily available in a downstream process of a “real-world” scenario. Furthermore, if the compound is accumulated intracellularly, it may prove to inhibit its own production, and potentially even growth. Therefore, in order to anticipate product secretion from the cells, it is important to ensure that an effective transport system is available, and hence, the latter becomes an important engineering target in cell factories.
        
         In our project, we engineered the cyanobacterium

         </SUB>
         as a resource for synthesizing fumarate - a versatile chemical traditionally manufactured from petroleum. Among other approaches, we aimed to increase fumarate yields through engineering an effective transport system. We expressed in Synechocystis the transporter leading to the highest fumarate yield increase in

         -dicarboxylate carrier, DcuC, with efflux as a major function (hereafter DcuC-ec) [2]. Bearing in mind that transporters are often not expressed or not correctly folded in a non-native host [1], we decided to also include a transporter from an organism that is more closely phylogenetically related.

        DcuC-ec (Bba_K2385001) and DcuC-NS (Bba_K2385000) are versatile BioBricks that have the potential to increase the yields of any organic acid producing cell factory. Standard biological parts (like these) and molecular biology tools have been developed for widely studied organisms as
        <I>
         E. Coli
        </I>
        . These parts can also be used in other organisms, but characterization of parts in a non-native host, reveals differences in performance. This emphasizes the importance of detailed part-characterization for a specific biological chassis. Good characterization and documentation opens up the possibility of enhancing the productivity of traditional (algal) compounds and producing new ones through metabolic engineering, bringing us one step closer to a biobased economy.

         The BioBricks were gene synthesized using the sequence from NCBI (NC_000913.3 and AHJ29173.1). Each of the genes was integratedinto the genome of

          , cells were collected from liquid culture. After being washed twice with fresh BG11 medium by centrifuging at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, cells were further concentrated to a total liquid volume of 200 µl. The plasmid containing homologous regions of the psbA2 promotor and DcuC-ec or DcuC-NS downstream was added and mixed with cells to a final concentration of 10 μg mL-1, and subsequently the mixture was illuminated under moderate light for 4 to 6 hours. The mixture was then spread on a commercial membrane (Pall Corporation) resting on the BG11 plate. After further illumination for 16~24 hours, the membrane with the mixture was transferred to another BG11 plate with kanamycin (50 ug/ml). After about one week, colonies were picked and scratched sequentially on a new BG11 plate with kanamycin. Colonies were picked for PCR confirmation (with 35 cycles). Further segregation was done in the liquid culture. After another 2 weeks, the strain was fully segregated. (fig. 1).

          was roughly 0.05. Continuous light was given at fixed light intensity of 20 µmol photons m-2 s-1 after inoculation, and then switched to 120 µmol photons m-2 s-1 after 24 hours.
          
           Cell culture samples were harvested at selected time points for OD and fumarate analysis. 1 ml of sample was centrifuged at 15.000 rpm  for 10 min. Then 500 µl supernatant was taken and filtered (Sartorius Stedin Biotech, minisart SRP 4, 0.22 µm) for sample preparation. Fumarate concentration was measured by HPLC-UV/VIS (LC-20AT, Prominence, Shimadzu), with ion exclusion Rezex ROA-Organic Acid column (250x4.6 mm; Phenomenex) and UV detector (SPD-20A, Prominence, Shimadzu) at 210 nm wavelength. 10 µL of the HPLC samples were injected through an autosampler (SIL-20AC, Prominence, Shimadzu), with 5 mM H2SO4 as eluent at a flow rate of 0.15 ml min-1 and column temperature of 45 ºC.

         However, after 150 hours, no extracellular fumarate is being produced by the DcuC-NS or DcuC-ec expression strains (fig. 2A). The ∆fumC is used as a control for fumarate production and produces roughly 1 mM of fumarate after 150 hours. This indicates that under these conditions heterologous expression of DcuC-NS alone is not sufficient for fumarate to be secreted above our detection limit (~0.05 mM). To our surprise, we measure extracellular lactate being produced by DcuC-NS with a maximum of 5 mM (fig. 2B). Lactate often indicates that there is a contaminant, but extensive contamination checks did not show contamination of any kind.

A next step would be to express DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS on the ∆fumC background that is already producing fumarate to see if this could further boost fumarate production. This will test simultaneously whether intracellular fumarate was the limiting factor in the experiment described above; and whether it is inhibiting its own production, and potentially even growth, in the strain with the
