         Until the 17th century, the area where Amsterdam Science Park now stands lay entirely under water. More than four metres below sea level, it took revolutionary technological advancement for the land to be reclaimed in 1629. Appropriately, today Amsterdam Science Park is home to one of the largest concentrations of beta sciences in Europe. This unique juncture of prestigious education, high-quality research and knowledge-intensive business has been carefully cultivated to stimulate innovation and collaboration. With the University of Amsterdam Faculty of Science, the Amsterdam University College, dozens of renowned research institutes and some 120 companies – from start-ups to multinationals – all working in the fields of IT, Life Sciences, advanced technology, and sustainability, Amsterdam Science Park has become a vibrant melting pot where business, science and innovation meet.

         Integrated DNA Technologies
        </P><P class="sponsor-txt">
         Integrated DNA Technologies sells short strands of DNA called oligonucleotides. The way that one strand of DNA specifically binds a second strand of DNA allows scientists to use short DNA strands (oligos) as research tools. A short synthetic piece of DNA can be used to bind or find its matching sequence even in a complex mixture of millions of unrelated pieces of DNA. It is this unique fact that allows researchers to decode and study the genetic makeup of any living organism. Using new oligo-based technologies, a revolution is underway where we are beginning to catalog the complete genetic makeup of hundreds of living things, ranging from bacteria to humans. Given a known DNA sequence, scientists can easily design a short oligo that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. It is this short single-stranded DNA that the researcher orders from IDT. IDT manufactures the oligo using chemical DNA synthesis machines designed and built in-house. We've refined the process to the point where we can receive an order as late as 1:00pm and have the desired oligo in the researcher's hands the next morning. Our customers range from small university labs of only a few scientists to global pharmaceutical companies, and everything in between.

         The Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) is the largest institute of the Faculty of Science. The institute comprises biological disciplines including molecular and cell biology, microbiology, plant science, physiology and neurobiology, supported by modern enabling technologies for the life sciences. The research groups of SILS also develop methods in genomics (micro-array, next-gen sequencing, proteomics), bioinformatics and advanced light microscopy technologies. Knowledge from adjacent fields of science, in particular biochemistry, biophysics, medicine, bioinformatics, statistics and information technology make SILS a multidisciplinary research institute with a systems biology approach to the life sciences. SILS’ research objective is to understand the functioning of living organisms, from the most basic aspects up to complex physiological function(s). Biological processes are studied at the level of molecules, cells, cellular networks and organisms. SILS research topics have in common that similar cellular processes and interactions are studied, likewise using similar methodologies and technologies. Therefore SILS scientists often study the same concepts in different biological systems. Within the institute, this leads to exchange of information and extension of research over the borders of different disciplines. Part of SILS research activities are directed to application-oriented research in close collaboration with industry.

         The Dutch consumer’s collective UnitedConsumers was founded in 2000. Over the years 500.000 consumers became a part of the collective. From the beginning UnitedConsumers has one purpose in mind: reduce the fixed charges of consumers, without compromising on service and quality. Members can get a discount on their car and health insurances, fuel, telephone subscriptions and energy (gas and electricity). As an energy supplier UnitedConsumers finds it important to take its responsibilities. That is why the consumer’s collective supplies green electricity to all its customers. Also, United Consumers informs and advises consumers on energy saving options. This way UnitedConsumers wants to contribute to a sustainable future, together with the consumers. In recent years United Consumers won awards for best service (GfK, Preferenso) and several times for best energy supplier (GfK, Consumentenbond, Vereniging Eigen Huis).
