         pointed out to us that it is only the fumarate that is excreted from the cells that is readily available in a downstream process of a “real-world” scenario. Furthermore, if fumarate is accumulated intracellularly, it may prove to inhibit its own production, and potentially even growth. We therefore anticipate that ensuring an effective fumarate transport system is an important engineering target for our cell factories. In this module of the project the goal is to: (i) study the native fumarate transport system of
         <I>
          Synechocystis

To test this in silico prediction we constructed single knock-out mutants of these putative genes of unknown function. Furthermore, we have also exploited the possibility of increasing fumarate production in our engineered strains through the expression of known heterologous fumarate transporters.

         Our cyanobacterial cell factories produce fumarate intracellularly, but the fumarate that we measure (and could easily harvest in a

          future downstream process
         </A>
         is extracellular. The efflux of fumarate that is taking place can be either the result of passive diffusion, or facilitated by a transport system. Fumarate is a dicarboxylic acid and has dissociation constants far below the intracellular pH of
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         . This causes fumarate to be almost completely in its ionized form, which makes it much harder to diffuse across a hydrophobic membrane. A native fumarate transport system in
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         is yet to be identified, but this strongly suggests a transport mechanism of some kind must to be present.
        </P><P>
         A transport mechanism in the form of a protein can be studied by knocking out the encoding gene and study the resulting phenotype. To this end, we are forced to first identify candidate genes that may putatively encode fumarate transport proteins within the genome of
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         . Membrane transporters are notorious for being promiscuous, often displaying affinity for multiple substrates [1]. However, their specificity for certain chemical properties (e.g. presence of two carboxylic acid groups) is often sufficiently conserved across phylogenetic clades [2], making it possible to attempt the identification of genes by sequence comparisons (i.e. by homology searching). Sequence alignments unambiguously distinguish between protein pairs of similar and non-similar structure when the pairwise sequence identity is high (&gt;40% for long alignments) [3]. Below 35%, the number of false positives increases tremendously and one can no longer infer a homologous relationship. Up to now, no C

         , which already indicates that the search will not yield an unambiguous result. We went to see an expert in the field:

         Together we designed a pipeline to tackle the problem from every possible angle, aiming to provide the support required for an educated selection. We made use of targeted searches, where we used sequence information from known, phylogenetically closely related transporters, but also protein motifs and conserved domains as a template for sequence alignment. Complementary, untargeted searches were used to profile large groups of sequences (including putative identifications) and find distant homologous relationships between proteins.

To prevent profile wandering with iterative tools, the inclusion threshold (e-value) for PSI-BLAST was set to 0.05.

         , an alignment method that integrates membrane-specific scoring matrices to improve alignment of the transmembrane regions [4]. It creates a Multiple Sequence Alignment file (MSA), that is taken as a template for HHSearch, present-day, the most sensitive protein sequence alignment method [5]. HHSearch computes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), similar to simple sequence profiles, but in addition to the amino acid frequencies in the columns of a MSA, they contain the position-specific probabilities for inserts and deletions along the alignment. The HMM is then aligned against the sequence database of
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         (tax id: 1148, which is a profile-profile alignment. By aligning profile HMMs instead of simple sequence profiles, both sensitivity and alignment quality improve significantly. This allows for the identification of more distant homologous relationships.

In separate searches, each of the gene sequences was used as a template to create a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), using PSI-BLAST on the NCBI NR db [6]. This was done in order to 'enrich' the sequence with information from related sequences.. ClustalX is used to create a MSA out of the PSSM, as this is the most sensitive method that is able to take a PSSM as template [7]. The MSA is subsequently taken as a template for HHSearch.

         First, we studied the effect of the deletions on fumarate efflux by cultivating the double knock-out strains (
         <I>
          ΔfumCΔsll1103
         </I>
         and
         <I>
          ΔfumCΔsll1314

         ) with
         <I>
          ΔfumC
         </I>
         as a control for 150 hours, while monitoring cell growth and fumarate production. We hypothesized that if one of the genes encodes a protein involved in fumarate export, we should measure less extracellular fumarate compared to the control strain.
        </P><P>
         Neither of the two gene deletions led to an inhibition of cell growth (fig. 3.4A). We are mostly interested in the log phase, as this is where the fumarate is produced (remember that
         <I>
          ΔfumC
         </I>
         is a
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         derivative producing fumarate as the cell grows). Zooming in on T = 49 (log phase) we can see that deletion of
         <I>
          sll1103
         </I>
         causes a diminishable and insignificant decrease in fumarate efflux (fig. 3.4B). Deleting
         <I>
          Δsll1314
         </I>
         , on the contrary, causes a significant decrease in fumarate efflux of 31 % (p-value &lt; 0.01, ANOVA). The fact that we still see extracellular fumarate suggests that
         <I>
          sll1314
         </I>
         is not the only transport system for fumarate, but this result validates that
         <I>
          Δsll1314

         is involved in fumarate transport.

         Secondly, the effect of the deletions on fumarate influx was studied by cultivating the single knock-out strains (

         We can see that both wild type and

          Δsll1103

         have restricted/no capability to assimilate fumarate, under the conditions tested (fig. 3.5). Our results thus strongly hint the absence/deficiency of the fumarate import transporter in

         .

         Lastly, the postulated promiscuity of the tentatively annotated dicarboxylate transporters,

         and

          sll1314
         </I>
         ,was tested for multiple substrates by performing high-throughput phenotyping array screens using BIOLOG plates. We hypothesize that if the target genes are involved in the uptake of other compounds, than we should see a difference in this screen when comparing the single knock-out strains (
         <I>
          Δsll1103

         and
         <I>
          Δsll1314

         ) with the wild type as a control. Comparisons can be performed in cells taken from cultures in the light and in the dark, since they display different expressions patterns [13].
        </P><P>
         We did not observe any differences in BIOLOG screen between wild type and the derivative knock out strains

         . This suggests that these two genes do not encode proteins involved in the transport of the substrates tested (fig. 3.6) This however does not mean that they may not be involved in the transport of other substrates, or that their expression pattern in wild type under different conditions could not have lead to a different conclusion.

         Introduction

         Current data on fumarate production in
         <I>
          Synechocystis
         </I>
         does not indicate that fumarate yields produced in our cell factories exceed the native transport capacity (at least not yet!) [14]. This indicates that overexpressing a transporter is not expected to have a great impact on fumarate productivity. However, this knowledge is based on model predictions and has not been fully experimentally validated.

         Therefore, we decided to express in

Bearing in mind that transporters are often not expressed or not correctly folded in a non-native host [1], we decided to also include a transporter from an organism that is more closely related phylogenetically.

         Both transporters are from the DcuC family, a family of transporters present only in (facultative) anaerobic bacteria capable of fumarate respiration. DcuC-ec is able to catalyze the uptake, antiport, and efflux of C

          We were able to integrate the heterologous transporters DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS into the genome of Synechocystis. When cultivating for 150 hours, no extracellular fumarate was produced by the DcuC-ec or DcuC-NS expression strain.
         </LI><LI>
          DcuC-NS is a putative C4-dicarboxylate transporter, but yet no experimental evidence can support this. Therefore, more extensive experiment have to be done on this transporter to confirm its function.

          A next step would be to express DcuC-ec and DcuC-NS on the ΔfumC background that is already producing fumarate to see if this could further boost fumarate production. This will test simultaneously whether intracellular fumarate was the limiting factor in the experiment described above; and whether it is inhibiting its own production, and potentially even growth, in the strain with the ΔfumC genotype.
