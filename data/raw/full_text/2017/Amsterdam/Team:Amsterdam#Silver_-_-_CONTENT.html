        Our team believes that good Human Practice and Public Engagement have been our two most important intrinsic motivators, rather than iGEM requirements. This became clear in the period that our team got to know each other during our Masters. As we became good friends, we discovered that each individual team member had a strong desire to stop talking about the big problems that society faces nowadays and start contributing to the solution of these issues. From the very beginning, we were determined to make our project mean something and we hope it will have an impact that extends beyond the scope of the iGEM competition. Before and during the design of our project, we have consulted our stakeholders in order to identify, investigate and address several Human Practice issues to the best of our abilities. Our stakeholders come from various walks of life and include academia, industrial and regulatory bodies and the general public. We have visited several large-scale events, conducted interviews with experts from the field, recorded a series of podcasts and visited the Photanol pilot plant in order to identify the industrial settings for creating a cell factory. The incredible contributions from all our stakeholders, makes us feel that, no matter the outcome, our project has been an immensely rewarding experience.

         We were present at the Climate Marathon to introduce the public to the possibilities that synthetic biology has to offer. Besides introducing the people to our project, we actively engaged in discussions, asking questions like: &quot;What do you think about genetic modification?&quot;, &quot;Is it natural to modify organisms?&quot;, &quot;Do we want to modify organisms if it contributes to solving environmental issues?&quot; and &quot;What are your thoughts on safety?&quot;.  We recorded the responses in a movie.
         
          It was amazing to see the the enthusiasm and the willingness of most people to think about these tough questions together. It was very inspiring; giving us the feeling that what we are doing is actually bigger than our work in the lab!

The ability to study, understand and manipulate genetic material has contributed to a biobased economy. Therefore, we talked extensively about how our project can support a biobased economy. In addition, Hans helped us getting in contact with companies and institutions aiming for a biobased economy, such as Differ, Amsterdam Economic Board and the Port of Amsterdam.

          Once we were there, it became clear that in the greenhouse where the cyanobacteria are grown, the primary source of light is the sun. However, this also means that roughly half of the time, it is dark, and because these are photosynthetic organisms, this also means that half of the time they aren’t growing. Juliette Marin (Photanol) explained that determining whether your cells are actually producing the compound that you want is quite the hassle, as there is no quick and easy way to sense if the strain is producing.
