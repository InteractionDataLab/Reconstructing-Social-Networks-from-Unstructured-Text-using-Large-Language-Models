       </P><DIV class="module-collapsible-container-inner" id="first" style="display:none;"><P class="collapsible-main-header" id="intro1">
         Introduction
        </P><P>
         Currently fumarate concentrations in liquid samples can be quantified through two well-developed methods, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzymatic assays. Both methods are costly and labor intensive. In our search for cyanobacterial cell-factories we need to measure fumarate concentrations very often. Measurements need to be accurate and specific to fumarate, and on top of that measuring should be quick and easy. Fortunately, synthetic biology may be used to derive a solution to this inspired in nature.
        </P><P>
         Bacteria have evolved to use two-component systems (TCS) to sense and adapt to changes in the extracellular environment. These systems are often highly specific to particular compounds and accurate in their measurement [1]. A TCS typically consists of a sensor histidine kinase (SHK) and a response regulator. The first sits in the membrane and gets activated upon sensing particular signals such as a specific compound The second gets activated by an active SHK and can then bind to DNA at specific loci to initiate a biological response [2]. We construct a fumarate biosensor based on the DcuSZ/OmpR chimeric TCS developed in
         <I>
          E. coli
         </I>
         by Ganesh et al. (2013) [3]. The SHK in this system, DcuSZ, is a fusion of two native
         <I>
          E. coli
         </I>
         SHKs, fumarate sensor DcuS and osmolarity sensor EnvZ. The protein domains in DcuSZ are the extracellular sensing domain and transmembrane domains of DcuS and the intracellular HAMP and histidine kinase domains of EnvZ. Coupling the emerging TCS to the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein leads to cells that fluoresce in response to extracellular fumarate (fig. 4.1).
        </P><FIGURE id="fig41"><FIGCAPTION class="module-figure-text"><B>
           Figure 4.1
          </B><I>
           The DcuS fumarate sensing, transmembrane and HAMP domains were fused to the EnvZ kinase leading to the chimeric DcuSZ/OmpR two-component system. Coupling this to fluorescent protein (EYFP) expression by using the ompC promoter leads to sensing and reporting of fumarate.
          </I></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
         We have created several differently fused DcuSZ genes to compare their functionality. The difference is in the length of the linker region between the DcuS and EnvZ functional domains. The linker region originates from the DcuS gene and forms an α-helix. A complete turn in an α-helix consists of approximately 3.6 amino acids, so by differing the linker length in steps of 5 amino acids we extend or shorten the α-helix by ~1.4 turns per step taken. This results in a titration of the different orientations of the EnvZ kinase relative to the membrane bound DcuS domains, and thus relative to the membrane. We expect the linker length and kinase orientation play a central role in the functionality of the system. By creating 9 DcuSZ genes with different lengths (fig. 4.2), at least one of them, and at best two, are predicted to be close to the optimal orientation. By taking more than one turn per step we also scan a relatively large range of distance between the DcuS and EnvZ functional domains. This may influence the kinetics of binding and activation of the engineered TCS, possibly leading to variants with different detection limits and signal dynamic ranges for fumarate. For detailed descriptions on strain cultivation, plasmid construction, testing conditions and data analysis see the

Orientations of the EnvZ kinase domains are shown relative to the orientation in DcuSZ 1, which is the gene as it was constructed by Ganesh et al. (2013) [3].

         Strains 1-9, containing corresponding DcuSZ 19 signaling systems, were screened for their functionality within a range of 0-10 mM of fumarate (supplementary fig. S4.1). This screening suggested that strains 1, 6 and to some extent 9 are functioning as biosensors. The screening also showed that the response in fluorescence/OD
         <SUB>
          600
         </SUB>
         is robust over time. Times of measurement were quite high, namely 16 and 22 hours, because the signalling system was only induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc) upon addition of fumarate. Ideally the system would be induced before adding fumarate, as in our case there is more time in which the strains can take up the fumarate. However, fumarate uptake is repressed by the presence of glucose in the medium [4].
        </P><P>
         A more thorough characterization of strains 1, 6 and 9 was performed, with a range of 0-20 mM of fumarate. By fitting a logistic curve to the data the detection limits and saturation levels of each sensing strain can be determined. Several nice examples of the logistic nature of similar sensing systems are shown by Pollard et al. (2016) [5]. By varying the linker length, and with that the kinase orientation, we expect to have changed the effectiveness of signal transduction in the chimeric DcuSZ protein. While intuitively one might expect only the range of signal detection to differ as a consequence, in reality the dynamics of the fluorescence output vary widely (fig. 4.3).

         respectively. DcuSZ 1 and 6 do have similar lengths, but DcuSZ 9 is 15-20 amino acids longer than DcuSZ 1 and 6, and yet strain 9 is also functional. The characterization suggests that strain 1 can be used to quantify fumarate concentrations up to 3 mM, strain 6 up to 6 mM and strain 9 even up to 20 mM (fig. 4.3). To quantify fumarate concentrations below 1 mM, calibration in the 0-1 mM range should be performed. While strain 9 can measure up to the highest fumarate concentration, it is less sensitive than strains 1 and 6. The logistic fit is the best for strain 6 and therefore its curve is the most trustworthy. The spread in the fluorescence/OD
         <SUB>
          600
         </SUB>
         of strain 1 is high, which leads to more uncertainty as to the level of saturation of this biosensor. The specificity to fumarate of these systems should be tested by comparing the response found here to the response to other C4-dicarboxylates (succinate, malate and aspartate). Previous work shows that the DcuSZ/OmpR system with the kinase orientation and linker length as they are in strain 1 is highly specific to fumarate [3].

         Conclusion
        </P><P>
         Based on our results, we are unable to identify a general trend in functionality caused by the linker length and kinase orientation. However, the results do show a large difference in fluorescence response as a consequence of DcuSZ linker length and kinase orientation. In general we can conclude that varying the linker length and kinase orientation in the chimeric DcuSZ/OmpR TCS has a complex and often detrimental effect on its functionality. In light of our project specifically, we can conclude that we have successfully created a family of biosensors capable of quantifying its concentration from (at least) 1 up to 20 mM with different dynamic ranges.

         Plasmids pCI148 and pCI146 used by Immethun et al., (2017) [6] were obtained and used as a starting point for the biosensor construction. A visual approach to plasmid construction can be seen in supplementary figure S4.2. The complete DcuS gene was amplified from the

          E. coli

         genome using primers 1-4, all primers can be seen in supplementary table S4.11. Amplification with these primers gave a point mutation at position 858 (T → C) to remove an Acc65I restriction site, the amino acid remains glycine (a.a. position 286). Next, the first part of DcuS was amplified with primers 5-14, adding an Acc65I restriction site to the start of the gene and resulting in DcuS fragments with 9 different lengths. The shortest fragment consists of 1020 base pairs (bp) and the longest of 1140 bp, with steps of 15 bp in between. The

         EnvZ gene was amplified from pCI148, this plasmid contains the last 690 bp of the original EnvZ gene. From pCI148 the first 570 bp of the partial EnvZ gene were amplified, up to and including the MunI restriction site, using primers 15-24. Fusion PCR resulted in 9 different DcuSZ genes, which were sequence confirmed by Macrogen Europe (supplementary table S4.2). Using Acc65I and MunI restriction enzymes the DcuSZ genes were placed in the pCI148 plasmid (replicative with an RSF1010 replicon), replacing the Cph8 gene. The DcuSZ containing plasmids were transformed into

         First a screening experiment was performed on all 9 strains containing the varying DcuSZ genes and the wild type. Subsequently a characterization experiment was performed for strains 1, 6 and 9. Both experiments were performed in
         <I>
          E. coli

         DH5α growing in shake flasks (screening) or glass tubes (characterization) in liquid mineral medium M9 + arginine (DSMZ 450) at 37℃ in an incubator with a shaking speed of 200 rpm. Antibiotics that were added to the experimental strains were kanamycin in a concentration of 25 μg ml

         <SUP>
          -1
         </SUP>
         . Ampicillin was not used since it influences OmpC transcription [7], and our system is placed behind the OmpC promoter. Pre-cultures were grown for ~24 hours in M9 before starting the experiment. At the start of the experiment cultures were diluted to an OD
         <SUB>
          600

         and fumarate concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 mM for the screening experiment and from 0 to 20 mM for the characterization experiment. The osmolarity of the fumarate solutions was kept equal by adding the appropriate concentration of NaCl. EYFP fluorescence was measured in a  96-well plate with a BMG FluoStar Optima plate reader, using excitation at 470 nm and emission at 510 nm, gain was set to 1000. OD

         For both experiments the raw fluorescence data was corrected for position bias of the wells by subtracting the 0 hour measurement of each well from all following measurements in that well. Next, the fluorescence was normalized by dividing it by the corresponding untransformed OD

         was subtracted from fluorescence/OD

         of all strains. To better compare the dynamics of each strain's response we removed the background fluorescence/OD

The Gompertz function is a Hill equation-like logistic equation with this structure: \(y = a e ^{-b e^{-c x}}\) where a is the asymptote and b and c are positive numbers.

         For a smaller range of cell factories fumarate detection can be performed in a standard 96-well plate. For the most accurate result you can pellet a culture with a producing strain and use the supernatant to resuspend the same amount of biosensor for each culture. A wild type culture should be used to subtract background fluorescence. We demonstrate this way of using the biosensor, specifically

         supernatant gave a fumarate concentration of 0.0870 mM which confirms our conclusion that the fumarate concentration was too low to be measured by strain 6, using the current calibration. Our result does indicate that with more thorough calibration such low concentrations can also be quantified, as the sensor still produces a stable and significant signal.

         We were able to qualitatively detect fumarate in the extracellular medium of one of our
