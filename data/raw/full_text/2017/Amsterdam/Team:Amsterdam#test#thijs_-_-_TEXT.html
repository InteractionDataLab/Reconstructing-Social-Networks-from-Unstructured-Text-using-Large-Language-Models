We are running out of oil and the climate is changing drastically due to the emission of polluting gases such as CO2.
But what if CO2 were a resource, rather than a wasteful pollutant; and might even replace oil?
Traditionally people have tried to achieve this by producing fuels and sugars with plants, and by fermenting these sugars with bacteria to produce other chemicals.
But there is a better way, where no arable land is needed and which is faster and more efficient. This is the way our team has chosen to go, using cyanobacteria to take up CO2 and directly convert it into the valuable chemical FUMARATE
PROJECT
Did you know that....
Fumarate is used to make certain plastics, food additives, and medicine and is currently made from petroleum.
