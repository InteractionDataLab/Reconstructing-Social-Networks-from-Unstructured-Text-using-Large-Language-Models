        We shaped our outreach activities to have the greatest impact in the short-term given the urgency of the challenge we tackle - Sustainability. Our activities were broad, but underpinned by a common denominator - bring awareness to the unsustainability issue haunting human societies, and how safe and well-designed biotechnological processes can provide solutions NOW. We interacted with students from different levels and with the general public directly at multiple occasions. Our project was disseminated via several channels such as printed and online publications, radio stations, mainstream news channels, social networks, etc.... We were also featured in high-profile debates related to climate discussing directly with policy makers at the highest governmental levels. On a personal level, we were also quite proud to welcome a Syrian refugee to use our project as a springboard into Dutch society. Ultimately, when adding up the reach, even conservatively, we are well over one million people!
