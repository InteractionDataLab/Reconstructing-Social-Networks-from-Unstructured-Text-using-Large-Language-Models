Our iGEM project is the result of seven months of team effort. Every member of our team has different qualities, which lead to division of the tasks. After finishing different subjects everything was discussed plenary, so everybody's point of view was integrated. We decided to do as much as possible with the team and minimally rely help from non-members of the team. The research that we conducted was based on previous findings of the Molecular Microbial Physiology Lab. In the table below the different subject are displayed with the members who were responsible for this and at the bottom of the page are some people we want to thank.
