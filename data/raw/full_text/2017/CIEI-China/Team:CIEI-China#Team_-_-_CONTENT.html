		Coming from all around the world, 15 members of CIEI-China gathered together out of their passion towards synthetic biology. During this marvelous journey, we have encountered massive challenges, and with the help of our instructors, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Qu, we conquered all of the difficulties, and improved ourselves unbelievably. We hope that our efforts in designing and producing this new type of salt-resistance yeast will eventually turn into practical application in protecting our environment from the bad effects of food waste, save more energy and finally improve our life qualities.</P><DIV class="team-members"><DIV class="first-level" id="a2">Teammates</DIV><DIV class="team-line"><DIV class="team-container"><DIV class="our-team"><DIV class="team-content"><H3 class="title">Qi He</H3><SPAN class="post">I’m Qi He, a year-11 student in Hun School Of Princeton. school. When I was taking biology in year-10, the knowledge of this subject amazed me. One of the topics that impressed me the most was the fact that gene is passed from generations to generations, which inspired me so much. As a member of the human practice group, my job was to interview as much as organizations which are related to our project. As a designer, I would like to use my art skill to design a symbol to show the spirit of our team. </SPAN></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="team-container"><DIV class="our-team"><DIV class="team-content"><H3 class="title">Skye Chen</H3><SPAN class="post">I am Skye Chen, a junior.
