During our experiment and the period of time we spent in the laboratory, we noticed several safety problems, and we would like to list them here:</P><P class="my-content">1.Follow the lab work instructions informed by our instructors.</P><P class="my-content">2.It is really necessary and important to wear the lab coat before we enter the lab.</P><P class="my-content">3.We should keep the lab coat clean, and we should not wear the lab coat in other occasions in order to prevent the diffusion of some harmful or toxic substance.</P><P class="my-content">4.We should not waste the reagent in the lab.</P><P class="my-content">5.It is forbidden to bring anything in the lab to the outside.</P><P class="my-content">6.We are not allowed to eat, drink, have lunch or make up in the lab.</P><P class="my-content">7.We must wear goggles or face protectors when dealing with the caustic and toxic substance.</P><P class="my-content">8.We must wash our hands before we leave the lab.</P><P class="my-content">9.Smoking and explosive materials are not allowed to be brought into the lab in case of fire.</P><P class="my-content">10.Food and drinks are banned from experimental places.</P><P class="my-content">11.After the experiment, we should turn off the equipment and avoid fire.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a3">Project Design Safety</DIV><P class="my-content">    Since our experiment does not involve any dangerous organisms, chemicals, or steps that may harm other organisms, the design of experiment processes does not have many potential emergencies that may lead to damage or injury. The whole experiment will be really safe and accurate if all experimenters follow the laboratory safety instructions about required clothing, ways to deal with chemicals, and proper use of scientific equipment in the lab. There are several points that need wariness while conducting the experiment:</P><P class="my-content">1.Before experiment, we always wear cloves, goggles, and lab coat firstly whenever we enter the lab for experiment. Professional protection wearing help avoid the spill of corrosive, poisonous, or bacterial liquid from directly contacting skin, which might cause injury.</P><P class="my-content">2.We read the instructions carefully as well as check the equipment before using them.</P><P class="my-content">3.The steadiness of electricity power is another safety concern. It’s a potential danger to both the experimenter and the equipment we are using.</P><P class="my-content">4.During experiment, we always wash hands with alcohol before performing on the clean-bench, and do not touch the alcohol burner unless the alcohol on our hands dries out.</P><P class="my-content">5.It’s important not to expose ourselves under UV rays while doing experiment or observing result of electrophoresis.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a4">Waste Management</DIV><P class="my-content">1.All waste materials generated during the experiment process are stored strictly in special containers with large capacity and taken care of by professionals after the waste amount reaches certain level.</P><P class="my-content">2.Disposable equipment are thrown into trashcan specialized for experimental waste after we ensure that bacteria are killed out by sterilizing kettle.</P><P class="my-content">3.Experiment equipment that is not disposable is also cleaned up first by water. Then, they are set into the sterilizing kettle to kill out possible bacteria remains inside. After that, the equipment is properly placed back to where they are taken from for tidiness, safety concern of the lab, and benefit the next team using the lab.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a5">Emergency Corresponding</DIV><P class="my-content">The building our lab locates in contains complete safety system including several escaping passageways, accessible fire-fighting equipment in every lab room and hallway, and smoke detectors on the ceiling for emergency. Fire can be deal with quickly whenever it happens.</P></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class="sponsor"><DIV class="sponsor-txt">Sponsors</DIV></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
