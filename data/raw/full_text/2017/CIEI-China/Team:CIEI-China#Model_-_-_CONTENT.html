It consists of rice, flour, vegetables, plant or animal oil, meat, bones, and so on, and therefore, contains high percentages of organic substances, mainly starch, protein, cellulose, and lipids. Specific Groups in food waste may vary in different regions due to their size, function, life level, and citizens’ habits; yet in China, food waste generally has a higher level of starch and lipids, with a lower level of protein and cellulose. Because of the amount of organic substances and moisture in food waste, which is considerably larger than in other solid waste, food waste is easy to decay at high temperature, produce repulsive smell, breed bacteria and pathogens, and thus lead to tremendous harms and pollution to the surrounding areas.</P><P class="my-content">Osmosis pressure plays an important role in microbes’ life. Their living environment must have a relatively equal osmosis pressure as in their cells; if the surrounding osmosis pressure goes beyond the limits or changes all of a sudden, microbes may not be able to conduct normal activities or even die. In hypertonic solution, the cells dehydrate, protoplasma contracts, and the cell plasma becomes viscous, leading to plasmolysis. In hypotonic solution, water moves in to the cell, and cells expand or even burst. In isotonic solution, microbes metabolize the best, and the cells neither contract nor expand – they keep their original form. Normal saline (0.85% NaCl solution) is one kind of isotonic solution.</P><P class="my-content">The influence of salinity on microbes mainly includes:</P><DIV class="third-level">Dehydration:</DIV><P class="my-content">Since water naturally move from lower concentration to higher concentration, if the outside environment contains excessive salt, water inside the microbes will get lost through osmosis, resulting in the change of inner biochemical environment. The microbes will unable to perform metabolic reactions and die of dehydration.</P><DIV class="third-level">Interference on the absorption</DIV><P class="my-content">Generally, cells absorb beneficial substances, a process influenced by outside solution concentration directly. Too much salinity will interfere or even halt the absorption, and repress microbes’ metabolism.</P><DIV class="third-level">Poisoning</DIV><P class="my-content">Salt may get inside of the microbes and destroy their inner biochemical reaction processes; some may react with cell membrane and change its protective/absorption   characteristics (for example, heavy metal salt).</P><P class="my-content">During our research, we discovered that high salinity influences anaerobic composting in the following aspects: 1. Active sludge: longer adjusting period, lower growing speed in logarithm growth period, longer decelerating period; 2. Stronger microbe respiration and cell lysis; 3. Lower organic biodegradable degree; 4. Lower composting efficiency.</P><P class="my-content">In the following article, we will discuss the influence of hypertonicity and high salinity on microbes in food waste anaerobic composting through dynamic models.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a3">Model Construction</DIV><DIV class="third-level"> Model Analysis</DIV><P class="my-content">Hypertonicity and high salinity  reduce the microbe survivability  in food waste disposal, and it is a negative factor in the anaerobic fermentation, which decreases the effectiveness and efficiency of the microbes.</P><P class="my-content">Anaerobic fermentation, known as anaerobic composting or biogas fermentation, refers to the process of transforming organic crop straw, livestock manure, organic waste from industrial and domestic waste water into CH<SUB>4</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB>.</P><P class="my-content">The essence of anaerobic fermentation is the transforming process of microbial metabolism and energy conversion. The microbes utilize a small part of organic matter for microorganism’s own metabolism, and the remaining part are used for biogas production.</P><P class="my-content">Anaerobic fermentation can reduce the amount of waste, achieve the purpose of reduction, decrease environmental pollution, and produce available energy to obtain green resources. The main components of biogas are CH<SUB>4</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB> and, 60% of which is CH<SUB>4</SUB>, 40% is CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and a small amount of etc. Different fermentation substrate produces slightly different biogas. At the same time, biogas residue and slurry produced by anaerobic fermentation can also be used as fertilizer and other agricultural purposes.</P><P class="my-content">Anaerobic composting is a process involving many stages and various microbes. People's understanding of this complex reaction process has developed through the Two-Stage Theory in the 1930s to the Three Stage Theory and the Four Stage Theory. According to the differences in microbes’ biological chemical process, Two Stage Theory divided the microbes into two groups: fermentation bacteria which produce methane and bacteria which do not produce methane, and the anaerobic composting was divided into acid and methane production stages. The acid production stage is the process through which the microbes decompose the complex organic matter into fatty acid, alcohol, and so on through hydrolysis, and the stage of methane production further transforms the substance into CH<SUB>4</SUB> and CO<SUB>2</SUB>. This theory gives a brief description of anaerobic composting, and guide the production practice of anaerobic fermentation in the last century; however, this theory did not fully reflect the essence of anaerobic composting, and there are still some questions remaining for further researches.</P><P class="my-content">With further anaerobic composting research, people have developed a deeper understanding of the relationship between microbial populations in anaerobic composting. In 1967, Bryant introduced the Three Stage Theory of anaerobic composting in 1979. The anaerobic composting process was divided into three stages: hydrolysis, acid production and methane production. At the same time, Zeikus et al. proposed the Four Stage Theory of anaerobic composting. The anaerobic composting process was divided into four stages: hydrolysis, acid production, acetic acid production and methane production. The Four Stage Theory has clearly defined the types and roles of microbes at each stage of anaerobic composting and thus received wide acceptance.</P><P class="my-content">On the one hand, the main influencing factors of anaerobic fermentation include total solids concentration, temperature, pH value and inhibition factors. In addition, the number of microorganisms plays a key role in the anaerobic fermentation; however, hypertonicity and high salinity can affect the number of microorganisms, so we, using anaerobic fermentation effect, have to analyze the osmotic pressure and high salinity effects on microorganisms. Therefore, we constructed a model to provide a detailed analysis of our idea.</P><DIV class="second-level" id="a4">Model Construction</DIV><P class="my-content">According to different composition of particulate organic matter and the hydrolysis process, hydrolysis kinetics model of particulate organic matter (POM) is divided into 3 categories: hydrolysis model based on the concentration of POM; hydrolysis model based on particle surface area of POM; hydrolysis model based on the component of POM. Therefore, we also considered the effects of hypertonicity and high salinity on microorganisms in accordance with these three models.</P><DIV class="forth-level">Hydrolysis Model Based on Concentration of POM</DIV><P class="my-content">In Contois model, substrate concentration is related to the initial substrate concentration in the anaerobic composting, saturation constant is proportional to the initial substrate concentration.

The fitting effect is good. The primary sludge can be regarded as a mixture of 4 components with different hydrolysis characteristics. Studies have shown that the Yasui.H model has a good fitting effect on the hydrolysis process of POM, such as food waste.
