1.Pour 1400 μL of the culture into a microfuge tube. Centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 rpm for 1 min in a microfuge. Pour the discard solution, leaving the leftover as dry as possible.
2.Repeat step 1 once.
3.Add 400 μL solutions P1 into the microfuge tube, wait until all deposition dissolves.
4.Add 400 μL solutions P2 to the microfuge tube; mix the content by inverting the tube rapidly for five times.
5.Add 560 μL solutions P3 to the mixture, wait until all deposition dissolves.
6.Centrifuge the microfuge at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant into a fresh column which is in a tube.
7.Centrifuge the supernatant at 12,000 rpm for 1 min in a microfuge. Discard the solution in tube.
8.Add 700 μL Washing buffer (PB) to the column, then centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Pour the discard solution in tube.
9.Add 500 μL Washing buffer (PB) to the column, then centrifuge the mixture at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. Pour the discard solution in tube.
10.Centrifuge the tube at 12,000 rpm for 2 min, then open the tube and dry the column.
11.Transfer the column to a fresh microfuge tube, then add 80 μL Elution buffer (EB), store it at room temperature for 5 min.
12.Centrifuge the microfuge tube at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, and then discard the column.

DNA Electrophoresis
1.Mix 0.25 g of agarose with 25 g of TAE solution, and then heat the mixture until the agarose is fully dissolved.
2.Pour the mixture into a square mould. Plug in the comb, and wait until the mixture solidifies.
3.Put the gel into the electrophoresis apparatus, and then fill it with TAE solution.
4.Add 1 μL of loading buffer and 1 μL of SYBR Gold into 5 μL of the sample.
5.Load the sample and marker into the gel. Connect two sides with the electric source. Set the voltage at 120 V and then wait for 30-40 min.
6.Take the gel out, and observe the results under UV transillumination.

1.Add the materials above in a conical flask (except the dextrose).
2.Shake the conical flask till all the materials were dissolved.
3.Autoclave the conical flask at 121°C for 20 min to sterilize on a liquid cycle.
4.Then swirl the conical flask gently. After it cool down to 50~60°C, add dextrose. Swirl the flask to mix them up.
5.Pour the LB agar in the conical flask on plates before it solidified.
6.Culture yeast that with our target gene and the yeast without our target gene. Couple days later, then test the survival rate of both kinds of yeasts.
Salt concentration testing of Kitchen waste
1.Dry the materials thoroughly in the oven.
2.Grind the dried materials into powder; weigh them, then add five times volume (mass-to-volume ratio) of boiling distilled water and fully mix them. (For example, 5g dried powder require adding 25mL boiling distilled water.) Extract the supernatant after standing or filtration.
3. Measure conductivity of the supernatant by conductivity meter and convert the data into salt concentration. (At 25̊C, based on the mass/volume ratio of 1:5, the salt concentration is calculated as the conductivity multiplied by 0.064.)
Principle: according to the fact that the salt concentration is proportional to the conductivity, the salt concentration can be calculated by measuring the conductivity of the samples.
