Qi He
I’m Qi He, a year-11 student in Hun School Of Princeton. school. When I was taking biology in year-10, the knowledge of this subject amazed me. One of the topics that impressed me the most was the fact that gene is passed from generations to generations, which inspired me so much. As a member of the human practice group, my job was to interview as much as organizations which are related to our project. As a designer, I would like to use my art skill to design a symbol to show the spirit of our team.
Skye Chen
I am Skye Chen, a junior. My interest in Biology first started on observing animals and pets. Later on, with a deeper understanding in biology, I found this subject is fascinating on molecular level. In our project, I am the human practice leader and I am also responsible for web design and Logo design. I often check in with group leaders and assign work to my team members to ensure that the human practice projectse are processing smoothly.
Scott Yeheng Zong
I am Scott Yeheng Zong，a junior from Beijing 101 High School. Because of my deep interest in biology, I joined this team, becoming a member of the human practice group. I really enjoyed the process of discovering knowledge and doing social activities which are related to our topic. I participated in sample collections and interviews, which greatly improved my social communication skills.
Xiyue Ding
I am Xiyue Ding, a senior from IB program. My interest in genetics started when I knew that my grandfather received lung cancer. All through the treatment to his death, I learned a lot about current development in curing cancer and noticed great limitations of chemo therapies. I have also realized that gene therapies have huge potentials and hope to study more in this field in the future. In this team, I am mainly in charge of conducting experiments and designing the wiki.
