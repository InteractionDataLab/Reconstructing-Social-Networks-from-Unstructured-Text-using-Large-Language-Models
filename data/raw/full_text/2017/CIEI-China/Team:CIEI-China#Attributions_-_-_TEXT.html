This year, our team, CIEI-China, is consisted of 14 high school students, including five boys and nine girls. Each of us has our own ideas and opinions, and we all have enthusiasm for biology. After anintense discussion and brainstorming, we decided our project idea. Next, we planned every step of the project, implemented the experiment, recorded the data, and prepared all the writing materials for the wiki.

General Support
We would like to thank China Agricultural University for providing our team the learning site and experimental training equipment and materials.
Thank you very much, Professor Wang Na of the laboratory. She spent a long time explaining and guiding us on operation of the experiment.
Special thanks to Ms. Qu, who taught us the necessary biological knowledge and answers our questions with great patience.
Thanks to Ms. Zhang for giving us help and support throughout the whole process. She coached us what is iGEM and how to prepare our presentation.
Lab and Modelling Support
We thank Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences for providing the necessary facilities and materials for the experiment.
Thanks to teacher Sun for instructing us during the experiment, such as the safety of the laboratory and the precautions of the experimental operation.
Thanks to Mr. Zhang Wei, who coached us with the programming of Wiki and helped us in designing our wiki.
Human Practices Support
During the training period, we invited Professor Mao to come to our training ground to give us a brief introduction of his research area---molecular biology and synthetic biology. Our team discussed with Professor Mao and he enlightened us in improvement of our research plan.
In the summer of 2017, our team members went to the community garbage treatment station and conducted a field investigation. We learned about the status of household waste in the community and collected the food waste samples which were already processed by the treatment station. In communication, we took each other's point of view and tried to make our products easier to be used in practice.
Thanks to the canteen at the Kasetsart University in Beijing, Beijing 101 Middle School student cafeteria 1 & 2, Sha Xian Xiao Chi, and other five anonymous restaurants for providing us a garbage sampling collection permit, so we had an opportunity to actually test the salinity in our kitchen waste.
Through unremitting efforts and consultations, we have successfully got found support from Nanjing Zhengbeicehui Equipment Inc., Hunan Tianxingjian Project Management Inc., Shanghai Songyuan Cork Foam Inc., Beijing Shiyuan Business Inc., Kanglihua Company, Beijing Huaxiafengxing Advertisement Inc., LP Team.
During the summer vacation, we also went to Tsinghua University and Peking University to visit their labs, get knowledge of the college-level research, communicated our ideas with our seniors. Our ideas have been recognized and some shortcomings have also been found.
Acknowledgement
First of all, we would like to present our appreciation to our directors: Ms. Zhang from ITCCC who taught us how to do the project, Mrs. Qu who taught us professional knowledge, Mrs. Wang and Mrs. Sun who helped us finish our experiment and Mr. Zhang who guides us on our wiki programming.
