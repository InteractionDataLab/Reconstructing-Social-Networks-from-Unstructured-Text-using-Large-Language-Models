Team Introduction
Coming from all around the world, 15 members of CIEI-China gathered together out of their passion towards synthetic biology. During this marvelous journey, we have encountered massive challenges, and with the help of our instructors, Ms. Zhang and Ms. Qu, we conquered all of the difficulties, and improved ourselves unbelievably. We hope that our efforts in designing and producing this new type of salt-resistance yeast will eventually turn into practical application in protecting our environment from the bad effects of food waste, save more energy and finally improve our life qualities.
Teammates
Qi He
I’m Qi He, a year-11 student in Hun School Of Princeton. school. When I was taking biology in year-10, the knowledge of this subject amazed me. One of the topics that impressed me the most was the fact that gene is passed from generations to generations, which inspired me so much. As a member of the human practice group, my job was to interview as much as organizations which are related to our project. As a designer, I would like to use my art skill to design a symbol to show the spirit of our team.
Skye Chen
I am Skye Chen, a junior. My interest in Biology first started on observing animals and pets. Later on, with a deeper understanding in biology, I found this subject is fascinating on molecular level. In our project, I am the human practice leader and I am also responsible for web design and Logo design. I often check in with group leaders and assign work to my team members to ensure that the human practice projectse are processing smoothly.
Scott Yeheng Zong
I am Scott Yeheng Zong，a junior from Beijing 101 High School. Because of my deep interest in biology, I joined this team, becoming a member of the human practice group. I really enjoyed the process of discovering knowledge and doing social activities which are related to our topic. I participated in sample collections and interviews, which greatly improved my social communication skills.
Xiyue Ding
I am Xiyue Ding, a senior from IB program. My interest in genetics started when I knew that my grandfather received lung cancer. All through the treatment to his death, I learned a lot about current development in curing cancer and noticed great limitations of chemo therapies. I have also realized that gene therapies have huge potentials and hope to study more in this field in the future. In this team, I am mainly in charge of conducting experiments and designing the wiki.
Lande Hu
I am Lande Hu, a junior from Beijing 101 Middle School. I recently started to study preAP Biology and found my interest in this subject. Because of my knowledge in chemistry and interest in biology，I was selected to be a member of experiment group. I have participated in conducting of the experiment for a few months. To support our human practice projects, I also collected necessary samples for the salinity testing in food wastes.
Ella Zhao
I am Ella Zhao, a senior from Yali Experimental Middle School in Changsha. “Nature I loved, and next to nature, Art.” I was delighted and amazed when realizing the poem Life and Death is in such accordance with my perspective of life. I love nature owning to my ardor for biology. I’ve always yearned to be a biologist, and that’s why I devoted all my passion to iGEM. As the leader of experiment group of our team, my job is to design and conduct experiments, as well as summarizing experiment results.
Sizhu Jiang
I am Sizhu Jiang, a senior from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I am interested in biology, as this subject lends meticulous explanations to seemingly elusive lives, ranging from Evolutionary Theory to cell structure. I enjoy my own exploration toward science, and iGEM offers me an opportunity to appease my curiosity in genetic engineering. I am the leader of our team and am responsible for organizing the teamwork, especially writing paperwork and holding human practice activities.
Mengxuan Yan
I am Mengxuan Yan, a senior from Nanjing Foreign Language School. I love biology, as this subject provides numerous opportunities for me to pursue the truths around my surrounding. I never feel bored when reading through scientific magazines and textbooks; I, inspired by rapid developments in biology, start to imagine my contributions in this field. I am the leader of the team in iGEM, being in charge of arranging writing and designing assignments in the project.
Yu Zhu
I am Yu Zhu, a junior from Beijing Changping New Oriental School. Since I was a child, I enjoyed watching the Animal World, and the magic of life and human being did attract me. Moreover, after reading many materials and books, I wanted to further my study and aimed to become a biologist. Joining iGEM is a good opportunity for me to closely learn about the molecular biology. And as a member of the experimental group, my duty was to design the methodology, carry out the experiment, and analyze the results.
Nate Feng
My name is Nate Feng, a senior from Beijing National Day School, and I aimed to be a biologist in the future. I’m the “lab guy” in this team, who conducted the experiment, analyzed the data, , and wrote the results part of our results. My interest in biology began since kindergarten for a reason that even I have already forgotten, but I just love everything about this subject. Being a part of iGEM’s team makes it possible for me to learn more professional knowledge and to meet lots of new friends.
Iven Guo
I am Iven Guo, a junior from Beijing Huijia Private School. I extremely enjoy video games, books and traveling. And I am an expert in Mathematics and biology. Are there any students who love biology not trying to take part in it after hearing about IGEM? Of course not. I'm here for fun. I'm here for challenges.
My duties are academic support and experiment support. It's quite hard to keep working on our project, but it's well worth for me.
Han Ji
I am Han Ji, a Senior from Wuhan Foreign Language School. I am willing to further my study in biology. By playing the Plague Inc, a game using pathogens to ruin the world, and learning that some bacteria in the intestinal systems benefit human, I realized that the relation between human and bacteria is really subtle. As a leader of experiment and wiki design in our team , my job was to select the appropriate genes, design the experiments and design the whole wiki project.
Flora Lin
I am Flora Lin, a junior from 101 Middle School. I was highly interested in biology and experiments. My friend recommended me to take part in the iGEM. I was soon attracted by synthetic biology and the basic experiments in molecular biology, which disclose the magical essence of science and world. My job in the team was to conduct the experiments, and I get immersed in every single step in the lab.
Zehua Liu
I am Zehua Liu, a junior from Beijing Huijia Private School. I was captured by the fascinating nature of biology and engineering, and iGEM offered me a good chance to devote my passion and creativity into this subject. I want to utilize my knowledge to solve certain problems. In the team, I am responsible for conducting experiments and writing necessary paperwork. I feel content when I was staying in the experiment room.
Hongyu Liu
My name is Hongyu Liu , a senior from Yali Experimental Middle School in Changsha. Looking at the pictures on the textbooks, I felt curious about the tissues in the creatures. How do those tissues work in my body? How can a monad survive with such a small size? Such questions drove me to find out more about biology. So I decided to join iGEM, to explore synthetic biology. In my team, I am in charge of setting up the wiki, which gives me a valuable chance to learn website programming.
