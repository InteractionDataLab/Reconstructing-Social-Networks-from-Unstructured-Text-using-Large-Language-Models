In the ideal disposal pathway, the initial food waste will firstly be  sorted into pure food waste and other waste. Other waste is consisted of plastic, paper products and metals, which cannot be decomposed by microbes in the further process. After  separation of the initial food waste, the machine would successively apply thermal treatment and solid-liquid separation on the food waste  to reduce the its moisture content to an optimal level (50%-60%), because based on  recent researches, excessive water content may hinder the effectiveness and efficiency of the microbes during waste decomposition. To obtain the maximum of useful organic substance during  fermentation, the machine uses our product, osmosis pressure resistant yeasts, to dispose the food waste  which is composed of oil-solution mixture and solid. Then we will be  able to gain the high-quality decomposed products which can be used for agricultural, medical and industrial purposes.
