This year, our team concludes 15 students of life science college, 1 student of department of physics, 2 students of mathematical science college, 3 students of information science and technology college, 1 student of chemistry college, 1 student of geography science college and 1 student of psychology college, a total of 24 excellent students. We decided on our project idea before summer holiday, and then we spent an amazing summer holiday together. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code, wiki and results documented on our Wiki were performed, written and collected by us. Here “Acknowledgement” is someone who helped us and we would like to thank to.
Following is our division of labour:
Project Design and Wet Lab Experiments
Under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Xudong, Prof. Yang Dong, and Prof. Xiang Benqiong etc, nearly all team members have taken part in the project designing process, especially those of wet lab group. Team leaders Nan Rong and Yutong Hou not only contributed the most in project design and lab works, but also managed the schedule and coordinated the cooperations between different groups in the team.
Modeling
Gengshuo Tian is the leader of the modeling group, and is the main contributor to the flagellar filament model and the model for FAFU. He also wrote the Wiki pages. Shang yang Li developed the microtubule models and analyzed it extensively. Lei Cao, working both in dry lab and wet lab, coordinated the communication between the two groups and offered key biological insights both in the general ideas of the models and in details like parameter estimation.
Wiki Construction
Wiki group consists of Zhaodong Wang, Ziyu Liu, and Xizong Zhang, who major in information science and technology. They all make great efforts in wiki construction.
Graphic design
Mengmeng Wang really did a fantastic work in graphic and web design.
Human practice
Suyue Lyu designed the whole human practice project and planned the trip to Boston with the assistance of Huanhuan Chu. Other three group members, including Ruoyan Li, Xiyu Dong and Yuanqiang Wan tried their best to make lots of contributions to each part of Human Practice.
