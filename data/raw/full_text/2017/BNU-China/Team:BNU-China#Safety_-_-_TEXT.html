Biomaterial Overview
Our project aims to improve the yeast surface display system by assemble biopolymers on the yeast cell wall. Here are two types of biopolymers synthesized our chasis organisms, the engineered S. cerevisiae str. EBY100 and INVSc1. One is tubulin protein, whose sequences originate in Mus musculus (house mouse). The other one is flagellin protein coded by codon optimized sequences of E.coli str. K-12. In addition, there are some enzymes fused with the subunits of the biopolymers, including PETase, Xynase, BG, EG, CBH. All of the organisms involved, both the chasis organisms and those we acquire original coding sequences from, are belonged to the risk group one, which do not cause disease in healthy adult humans.
Measures
Even though the organisms of our choice are relatively safe ones, we still took necessary measures to guarantee the safety of our project.
First of all, we strictly limited the engineered strain within the lab by destroying their ability to survive under environment lack of certain substances. The engineered EBY100 cells cannot sustain deficiency in leucine, and the engineered INVSc1 cannot survive without histidine, tryptophan, and leucine.
Secondly, before starting our lab work, we thoroughly examined the safety protection facilities, including wall-mounted eye-wash and emergency shower, first aid kits, fire extinguishers, etc. The broken, dysfunctional, overdue ones were immediately fixed or replaced.
Thirdly, to keep the risk of accidents and leakages to the lowest level, we strictly followed the rules and codes of safe operation listed below:
No slippers and pants would be permitted in lab. Close-toed shoes are worn at all times in the lab.
Gloves and medical mask is ordered when working in the labs, especially with some aerosolizing agents, such as SDS.
Hands must be washed before leaving the lab area. And lab coats are mandatory precaution.
No food or drink are allowed in the lab.
All bench space is wiped with 75% EtOH before and after use, and the biosafety cabinets are exposed to UV for twenty minutes before and after use.
All unnecessary equipment is unplugged and removed from bench after use.
All rules on safety operation on high-risk equipment are strictly followed as documented in our video .
