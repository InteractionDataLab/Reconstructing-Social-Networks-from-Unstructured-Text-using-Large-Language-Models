Abstract
Our project aims to improve the loading capacity of yeast surface display system by displaying microtubules and flagellar filaments, respectively, onto the yeast surface. To start with, by using the agglutinin system, we anchored subunits of fibrous polymers which were represented here by microtubulin subunits or FilC, on the cell wall of yeast. Since the particular polymers' self-assembly could take place outside the cell, we provided the engineered yeast with an environment rich of pre-secreted polymers’ subunits. In this way, an extracellular tridimensional display system could be formed, which enlarged the loading capacity by roughly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we remodified the structure of FliC, substituting its D3 domain by an enzyme of interest. By this means of displaying a fusion prtein of FilC-enzymes, the co-display ability was significantly enhanced. As a result, a highly efficient, whole-cell biocatalyst system was established.
