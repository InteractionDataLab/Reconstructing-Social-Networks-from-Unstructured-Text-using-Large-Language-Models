Light at a wavelength of 340 nm is scattered by microtubules proportionally to the concentration of polymerized microtubule. Purified α and β tubulins secreted by engineered INVSc1 were mixed together and incubated at 37℃ for 1 hour, and absorbance readings at 340 nm were conducted every minute. The results are shown in the image below.Comparing the absorbance curves obtained, it was clear that the secreted tubulins had successfully polymerized into microtubules when GTP is added into the system.</P><H4>Figure 9 Absorbance curve of polymerization reaction at 340 nm.</H4><P>To get more definitive results, we observed samples with High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM).

            In display module, we constructed and validated the following 6 parts. They are pYD1-FliC <A href="">(BBa_K2220002)</A>, pYD1-XynA<A href="">(BBa_K2220004)</A>, pYD1-PETase<A href="">(BBa_K2220005)</A>, pYD1-BG<A href="">(BBa_K2220007)</A>, pYD1-EG<A href="">(BBa_K2220006)</A>, and pYD1-CBH<A href="">(BBa_K2220008)</A>, which means to fuse the target gene sequences with AGA2 gene respectively. We also constructed pYD1-FilC(eGFP) <A href="">(BBa_K2220003)</A> as our positive control. The length and sequence of each parts have been validated by sequencing and electrophoresis. The length validation are presented on the part registry page.

        We then validated the function of our pYD1-FliC(XynA) by testing the enzyme activity of recombinant <I>S. cerevisiae</I> EBY100 harbouring pYD1-FliC(XynA). We cultured and induced control group(EBY100-pYD1) and experimental group(EBY100-FliC(XynA)) at the same initial concentration in SG-CAA medium (plus 5% xylan). Supernatant of the same volume were collected every two hours from 10h to 18h to examine the concentration of reducing sugars by DNS method. The results are shown below.</P><H4>Figure 16 Xylnase enzyme activity assay curve.</H4><P>The value of OD<SUB>540</SUB> is of positive correlation with the concentration of reducing sugar assayed by DNS method. So here we used the value of OD<SUB>540</SUB> to estimate the concentration of reducing sugar. Before 14h, engineered yeasts were consuming the galactose in medium, so the OD<SUB>540</SUB> values of two groups were similarly decreasing. After 14h, the OD<SUB>540</SUB> of the control group was still decreasing, while the values of the experimental group had changed to increase, and decreased again after 16h, which means that FliC(Xylanase) proteins had been displayed in a certain quantity at the beginning of 14h and degraded the xylan of culture medium to xylose, so the concentration of reducing sugar increased. After a period of time, yeast absorption rate of xylose and galactose was greater than that of xylan decomposed by enzyme, so the concentration of reducing sugar decreased again. Thus, from here we conclude that our FilC(XynA) were successfully displayed on the yeast surface.</P><P><B>Secretory module</B></P><H3>Plasmid construction</H3><P>In secretory module,we successfully constructed the following parts: pYCα-FliC(XynA) <A href="">(BBa_K2220011)</A>, pYCα-FliC(BG) <A href="">(BBa_K2220014)</A>, pYCα-FliC(EG) <A href="">(BBa_K2220013)</A>, pYCα-FliC(CBH) <A href="">(BBa_K2220015)</A>, and pYCα-FliC(eGFP) <A href="">(BBa_K2220003)</A> as positive control.
