The value of foundational advance projects always lies in their application, whereas there's still a long way to go from lab experiments to fully functional products. For instance, it's the researchers' responsibility to consider the safety issues raised by the interaction between the application and the human society. Considering the possible application of our project, we decided to conduct an investigation on the perception of average customers held towards the biosafety issues on common biological enzyme preparation. Besides, we participated in a series of academic conferences, during which we exchanged our ideas with other participants and sought out for chances of collaboration. </P><H2 id="title2">Gold</H2><P>The goal of our project is to develop the yeast surface display system. For this purpose, we've contacted a lot of experts, companies in related fields to acquire information on the prospects, potentials and weakness of this technique. Throughout these interviews and investigation, we've developed a profound understanding on the interaction between our project and the society, which in turn has enlightened the evolvement of our project.</P><H2 id="title3">Public Engagement</H2><P>As an iGEM team rooted in the Chinese society, we consider it our duty to engage in propagating the brilliant idea of synthetic biology and iGEM to the rest of the community. To start with, we designed an investigation project to dig into the past developmental process and present stage of the Chinese iGEM community, and how its vivid atmosphere has affected the individuals in it. The focus of this investigation was fixed on the motivation and learning strategy of iGEMers. Meanwhile, we exploited the resources we had as a leading university in the area of education and teaching. We launched a four-week introductory course series in Beijing Bayi High School and three other high schools, hoping to inspire the kids there and sum up our experiences to improve the method on the education of synthetic biology. What's more, to spice up the user experience of our site, we created a user-friendly desktop assistant system as a compulsory part, which users can interact with and access the knowledge and information of our project and synthetic biology from. We believe that this cute desktop assistant will win over the hearts of our viewers and fulfill its mission of spreading the idea of synthetic biology.</P><H2 id="title4">Collaboration</H2><P>Lab safety have been brought up as one of the major issues of consideration since the very beginning of our project. However, there're no properly filmed lab safety education video accessible in Chinese. Therefore, we established a collaborating program with Shanghai Technology University and 11 other universities to produce a comprehensive series of Chinese voice-over safety education videos.</P><DIV style="background-color:#F7EDB7;text-align:center;"><P style="text-align: center;color: #e5b051;padding-top: 5px;margin-top:75px;">Copyright © 2017 <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:BNU-China" style="color: #9E2B20;text-decoration: none;opacity:0.8;">BNU-China</A> All rights reserved.</P><P style="text-align: center;color: #e5b051;margin-bottom:-20px;">If you like this page, you can contact us: <SPAN style="color:#9E2B20;text-decoration: none;opacity:0.8;">bnu_igem@163.com</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
