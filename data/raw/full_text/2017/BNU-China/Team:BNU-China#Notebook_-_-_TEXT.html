Acknowlegement
Week 1 (March.19 - March.25)
Wet Lab
Read excellent literatures about synthetic biology and projects on iGEM Official Website.
Week 2 (March.26 - April.01)
Wet Lab
We discussed with our instructors about the project designing and decided to improve Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface display technology. Then we read iGEM projects about Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface display.
Week 3 (April.02 - April.08)
Wet Lab

Week 4 (April.09 - April.15)
Wet Lab
After discussion, we set our initial project theme that displaying human tubulins on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we read more literatures about tubulins.
Week 5 (April.16 - April.22)
Wet Lab
We visited Mr Meng who is the doctor of Chinese Academy of Sciences and discussed our project with him. Through the discussion, we found it difficult to keep tubulins lasting polymerization in vitro. So we attempted to look for more stable materials. At last, we found flagellin which can polymerize spontaneously in vitro.
Week 6 (April.23 - April.29)
Wet Lab
Our experiment was discussed and designed. We divided the display system into two parts: the display modules and the secretory modules. With the special structure of surface display system, we could display the particular subunit onto the Saccharomyces cerevisiae surface as a linkage site and secrete other subunits into the extracellular environment to create a subunit-rich surroundings. With the optimal concentration of subunits, GTP and other ions, those subunits could reconstitute into microtubules and flagellum. In this way, we could finally display the microtubule and flagellum on the cell surface. And then, we could use this upgraded system to facilitate small molecules screening.
