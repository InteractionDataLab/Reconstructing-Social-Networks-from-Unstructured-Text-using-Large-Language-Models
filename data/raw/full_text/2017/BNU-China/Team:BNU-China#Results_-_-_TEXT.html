Microtubule
Plasmid construction
We have accomplished the construction of 6 main parts whose functions are described respectively in the previous design page. (Microtubule module) They are pYD1-α tubulin (BBa_K2220019) , pYD1-β tubulin (BBa_K2220020) , pYCα-α tubulin (BBa_K2220022) , pYCα-β tubulin (BBa_K2220023) , pYCα-mCherry-α tubulin (BBa_K2220024) , pYCα-β-tubulin-mGFP (BBa_K2220025) and pYCα-mCherry (BBa_K2220021) . All parts have been validated by sequencing.

Protein expression analysis- Fluorescence microscopy
These are the images recorded by the Fluorescence microscope. The engineered yeasts were induced at 30°C for 20 hours. From the image, we can see that our engineered yeasts have successfully expressed our recombinant proteins mCherry-α and mCherry. Moreover, the expression rate of mCherry is almost up to 100%.

Protein expression analysis- Western blot
The image shows the results of a Western blot analysis carried out with an anti-V5 antibody. The recombinant proteins are expressed by the engineered yeasts which contain pYCα-alpha, pYCα-beta, pYCα-mCherry and pYCα-mCherry-αtubulin, respectively. After 24h inducing，the recombinant proteins are extracted and analysed by Western blot.

Our engineered yeasts, containing pYD1-β tubulin vector, have been proved to have successfully expressed exogenous βtubulin by Western blot analysis.

Flagellar Filament
Plasmid construction
We have successfully constructed the following 11 parts that have been described in detail in the previous design page. (Flagellar filament module)
In display module, we constructed and validated the following 6 parts. They are pYD1-FliC (BBa_K2220002) , pYD1-XynA (BBa_K2220004) , pYD1-PETase (BBa_K2220005) , pYD1-BG (BBa_K2220007) , pYD1-EG (BBa_K2220006) , pYD1-CBH (BBa_K2220008) , which means to fuse the target gene sequences with AGA2 gene respectively. And we also constructed pYD1-FilC(eGFP) (BBa_K2220003) as our positive control. The length and sequence of each parts have been validated by sequencing. The length validation are presented below.

In secretory module,we successfully constructed the following parts: pYCα-FliC-XynA (BBa_K22200011) , pYCα-FliC-BG (BBa_K2220014) , pYCα-FliC-EG (BBa_K2220013) , pYCα-FliC-CBH (BBa_K2220015) ，and pYCα-FliC-eGFP (BBa_K2220003) as positive control. The lengths and sequences of each part has been validated by sequencing. The length validations are presented below.

Protein expression analysis- Western blot
The image shows the results of a Western blot analysis carried out with an anti-His antibody. The recombinant proteins are expressed by S.cerevisiae INVSC1 pYCα-FilC(PETase) and pYCα-FliC(XynA) respectively. After 24h inducing，the recombinant proteins are extracted and analysed by Western blot.
