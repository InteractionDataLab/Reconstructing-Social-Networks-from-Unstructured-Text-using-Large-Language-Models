Asia-Pacific Conference in Taiwan
We attended International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference held by National Chiao Tung University from July 31st to August 4th 2017. Over 20 iGEM teams attended the conference and 6 members of our team was sent to Taiwan.
During the conference, the iGEMers communicated, changed ideas and learned from one another. The conference is not only a simple warm-up for the upcoming world championship in Boston, but an Asian regional platform for teams from different countries to exchange ideas and explore synthetic biology as well. All the teams made a project presentation and introduced their projects. In this way, we received useful feedbacks and technology-improvement suggestions from students and professors of other teams.

Software Promotion
Since our software is an open and fantastic platform with practical functions for synthetic biologists, itâ€™s of great importance to promote our software to synthetic biology related users.
To find out whether our improvement above is useful or not, We packed up an alpha version distributing to schoolmates whose major is biology in September. And in October we packed a more advanced version to some igem teams worldwide. We introduced them to Biohub and its basic usage. After they had used this software for a while, most of them reported that it was quite useful. And then we have packed our completed version to the real synthetic biologists by now.
