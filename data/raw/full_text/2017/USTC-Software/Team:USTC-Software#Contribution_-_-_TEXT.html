Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient Biobricks information retrieval and more convenient biological ideas sharing. It is also a flexible plugin which allows users to develop new functions and integrated them into the platform. Plugins will have full access to the community's data, so plugin developers can make further analysis of the parts.
