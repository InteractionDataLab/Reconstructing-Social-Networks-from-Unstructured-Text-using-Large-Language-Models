Q1. Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
A1. We surely had a great summer. We travelled to Taiwan and Shanghai, had dinners together,                 played video games together,                 and fixed bugs together. We are preparing to have a wonderful Halloween at the Giant Jamboree.
