Team
We couldn’t have accomplished all that we have without the great people in our team. Extra special thanks to our PIs, Mr. Zivanic and Dr. Pattison who worked tirelessly to help us. There’s some more awesome people mentioned on the attributions page who helped us on our project but weren’t part of our team.
