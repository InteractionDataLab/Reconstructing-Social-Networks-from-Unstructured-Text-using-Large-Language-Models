Toehold Switch Tools
The toehold switch tools below can create a toehold switch candidate for a given strand of miRNA. It finds a complementary strand to the input and then, using a customisable ribosome binding site and linker sequence, creates a potential toehold switch. This switch is broken into itâ€™s functional parts for clarity to help with manual editing. There is also a button which will send the toehold switch straight to NUPACK for analysis.
The tools automatically check for illegal sites and stop codons, and can simultaneously show the complementary and reverse strands.
This was used by our team as part of the design of our switches and could be used by future iGEM teams working in a similar area to speed up their design.
