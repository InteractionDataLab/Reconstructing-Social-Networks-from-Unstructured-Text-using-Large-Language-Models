	</P><P>We couldn’t have accomplished all that we have without the great people in our team. Extra special thanks to our PIs, Mr. Zivanic and Dr. Pattison who worked tirelessly to help us. There’s some more awesome people mentioned on the <A href="/Team:CLSB-UK/Attributions" title="Team:CLSB-UK/Attributions">attributions page</A> who helped us on our project but weren’t part of our team.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sammy_Lovat">Sammy Lovat</SPAN></H2><P>Sammy is our chief biologist, and has a slightly unhealthy passion for toehold switches. He has led the team well, despite a knack for grilling anyone who dares slightly misinterpret complex synthetic biology. Needless to say he has been involved with most of the team’s work, particularly in designing our toehold switches. Fortunately (for the sanity of all future patients) he has chosen to study biochemistry over medicine next year.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Abe_Tolley">Abe Tolley</SPAN></H2><P>Abe has an array of talents. He has used his to charm to successfully secure funding as well as being instrumental in the actual biology of the project. His desire to study medicine and passion for oncology has been more than useful (though he must remember always to close PCR tubes before placing them in the thermocycler). His calm and kind manner combined with biological knowledge and management skills have made him an ideal team leader. Outside of the lab, Abe plays possibly the most niche 'sport’ in the world: Eton Fives.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Adam_Jones">Adam Jones</SPAN></H2><P>Adam does 'great things' - or at least that’s what he tells us every time we ask about how modeling is going. His computing and mathematical knowledge has made him priceless in creating the computer models used to design our toehold switches. Despite not studying biology in school he is one of our student leaders. He also is an expert in graphic design - and is responsible for our wiki and poster’s allure. He is highly organized, and is quite good at pretending he knows what he’s doing. Next year he wishes to refine his skills by studying computer science at university.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="George_Smith">George Smith</SPAN></H2><P>George is a talented mathematician and a crucial part of the modeling team. He has also provided a helping hand with lab work. Along with Adam, he created the model of our system as well as designing the toehold switch tools. Whenever asked to describe how he finds his analytically unsolvable differential equations or similar, he invariably replies 'too easy'. Outside of the classroom, George set up a successful football team in which he is player-manager and still has dreams of managing professionally himself.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Gaspard_Salle_de_Chou">Gaspard Salle de Chou</SPAN></H2><P>Gaspard’s area of expertise is research, having looked into miRNAs and cancer diagnostics. Needless to say, his brains and diligence have been of great use to the team. So too, his micro-pipetting skills have come in handy and he is a crucial part of our lab work team. Next year he wishes to pursue natural sciences (in the non-medic minority).  Outside of iGEM, Gaspard is known for his most impressive name - Gaspard Yve Etienne Salle De Chou - and yes, it does mean room of cabbage.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Alex_Landell_Mills">Alex Landell Mills</SPAN></H2><P>Alex is a highly committed, intelligent and essential member of the iGEM team. Another hopeful medic, he has been very involved with the project from its inception, with a focus on human practices. He has had the pleasant task of immersing himself in cancer research, and is highly knowledgeable on the clinical implementations of our project. 
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Rahul_Shah">Rahul Shah</SPAN></H2><P>Despite being in the year below, Rahul has contributed massively to the team with his medical knowledge and admirable work ethic. He has found time over his GCSE period to keep on top of iGEM research, and came in frequently during his summer holidays. He is the type of person every team needs and is primed to lead the CLS iGEM team next year. He is yet another hopeful medic (although luckily there’s more time to change his mind).
</P><P>Rohan Desai
Rohan is a bubbly character and is part of the human practices and biology team. Over the summer he has been carrying out wet lab work meticulously with a very steady (like his run rate) hand on the micropipette. Apart from his interest for science and research, cricket is also unsurprisingly in his repertoire.
</P><P>William Chataway
William, another aspiring medic, has been primarily involved with the human practices side of our project. As a talented writer, he has also been our voice within the community and has written numerous articles about our project. 
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Suleyman_Ullah">Suleyman Ullah</SPAN></H2><P>Suleyman role has been predominantly with the biological side of the project. He has been a key researcher for the team as well as being heavily involved with the wet lab work. His steady hand, perhaps acquired from the pool table, has worked wonders in the lab. He has been a credit to the team and is always at hand when something needs to be done.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Joe_Allen">Joe Allen</SPAN></H2><P>Joe is a jack of all trades - his passion for art has helped design our beautiful wiki, and he has immaculate micropipetting skills in the lab. Much of his job has been coordinating people, going back-and-forth between Mr Zivanic and the team and ensuring that we have enough people in the lab for each day’s work. He has also worked tirelessly in creating and calibrating our fluorometer. He is especially interested in astrobiology, the study of how life would differ chemically on a different planet.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sasha_Walter">Sasha Walter</SPAN></H2><P>Wanting to study biochemistry at university, Sasha is interested in the biological and practical aspects of our project. He has helped research theory behind our work, and been a key member or the wet lab team. In his spare time he impressively plays karate for England and is a talented water polo player - our U18 vice-captain at CLS.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Nabil_Choudhury">Nabil Choudhury</SPAN></H2><P>Nabil has been involved in human practices research, as well as efficiently carrying out wet lab work. Nabil is yet another probable medic with an interest in psychiatry.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Leon_Scott-Engel">Leon Scott-Engel</SPAN></H2><P>Leon is an art aficionado and our beautiful logo was one of his masterpieces. He specializes in digital painting and design, and has been valuable in creating all our images. Next year he wishes to do a foundation course in fine art.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Lior_Tapnack">Lior Tapnack</SPAN></H2><P>Lior played a crucial part in the fundraising process - with no shortage of confidence, Lior helped persuade potential sponsors into donating the funds needed for the project. Despite not studying any science subjects he was an integral part of getting the project off the ground, showing that diversity in expertise massively strengthens a team.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mr._Zivanic">Mr. Zivanic</SPAN></H2><P>As a high school team, we are constantly asked the question “how are you able to enter iGEM still at school?”. Our answer we invariably give is that “we have an amazing PI” (also, not sleeping helps with time management). Mr Zivanic has facilitated every aspect of the project - without him none of it would have been possible. He has constant patience to teach, explain and put up with our questions.This is no mean feat given how often we bug him but may explain why he drinks 8 cups of coffee every day. Not only that, but he has devoted hours of his own time - including before school and during the holidays - assisting us with our lab work and ensuring all aspects of the project are going smoothly. He is meticulous, ruthlessly efficient and also a highly engaging person with a great sense of humour. We are extremely lucky to have him as a PI and a teacher, and cannot thank him enough.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Dr._Pattison">Dr. Pattison</SPAN></H2><P>Dr Pattison, our secondary PI, has supported us whenever needed. She has been heavily involved in preparations for the Jamboree, helping out as we fumble through practice presentations. We appreciate her help with iGEM, despite her busy teaching schedule.
