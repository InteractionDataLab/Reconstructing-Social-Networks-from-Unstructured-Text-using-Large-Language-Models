The lab work, wiki design and development, poster design and any images or diagrams were done by team members except where otherwise attributed.
Biology technicians
The brilliant biology technicians at our school helped us by sourcing and setting up the equipment we used in our lab work, as well as generally keeping everything organized.
Kirsten Jensen, Imperial
Kirsten helped with troubleshooting whenever OpenWetWare and other forums did not yield useful info. She also helped us secure sequencing vouchers from Eurofins, as well as allowed us to store our competent cells and cell-free extracts in Imperial’s labs. When we urgently needed more pSB1C3 plasmid, she rescued us with some miniprepped BBa_J04450 that they had from last year. She has been our go-to person whenever we “hit the wall” and we have used her as the fountain of all knowledge. Her continuous encouragement was much appreciated throughout the project. Without her expertise, it would have been virtually impossible for us to test our constructs in the cell free system.
Westminster
We collaborated with Westminster, and they allowed us to use their plate reader to do the Interlab . Their PI, Dr Caroline Smith, assisted us while we carried out the interlab readings - without her we couldn’t have done it!
Alexander Wood
Alexander Wood and his physics department at CLS kindly lent us their soldering equipment. He and the physics technicians put up with us coming early several times to build the fluorometer - without them our hardware would not exist!
Aachen 2014 and Denver Biolabs 2016
Aachen’s iGEM team created the initial guide to building a spectrofluorometer including a useful component list. Denver Biolabs shared their improved designs for the spectrofluorometer housing and cuvette holders. This was used as part of creating our hardware . They both also helped us troubleshoot our first device via email.
Alleyn’s School
Alleyn’s kindly laser-cut the casing and 3D printed the cuvette holders we needed to build our hardware .
Professor Laurence Lovat and Dr Sujal Desai
Professor Laurence Lovat and Dr Sujal Desai reviewed our survey for healthcare professionals, helped us to improve it and then distributed our questionnaire.
