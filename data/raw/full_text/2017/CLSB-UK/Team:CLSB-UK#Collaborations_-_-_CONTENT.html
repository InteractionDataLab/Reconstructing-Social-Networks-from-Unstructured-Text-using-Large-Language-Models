We helped them with a mixture of modeling, and wiki development and they have helped us massively in return - giving us advice, testing our hardware and software, reviewing our guide for high school teams and letting us use their facilities.

</P><P>Their <A href="/Team:Judd_UK/Collaborations" title="Team:Judd UK/Collaborations">collaborations page</A> mentions us too!
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="What_we_did_for_them">What we did for them</SPAN></H3><P>We met near the start of the iGEM cycle and discussed both wiki development and modeling, giving them lots of advice and actionable tips - these are available for all high schools in our <A href="/Team:CLSB-UK/HP/HS_Guide" title="Team:CLSB-UK/HP/HS Guide">high school guide</A>. We helped them derive their differential equations and explained some reaction kinetics. 
</P><P>We later advised them on modeling. We suggested ways of modeling their inducible promoter and advised them on solving differential equations, both analytically and numerically. We also helped them find constants for transcription and translation as they are also using a cell free extract. We checked the matlab code for their final model. Their results validated their model. Take a look at their modeling page for details
</P><P>At the UK iGEM meetup we gave them ideas about what to do for human practices.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="What_they_did_for_us">What they did for us</SPAN></H3><P>They tested our <A href="/Team:CLSB-UK/Software/SynBioBot" title="Team:CLSB-UK/Software/SynBioBot">synthetic biology bot</A> giving us useful feedback including suggesting the team lookup feature, the ability to repeat a step in the protocol (as opposed to just next and back), which we implemented. They also suggested having a command to skip to a particular step which we tried to implement but found it wasn’t feasible as it caused conflicts with the part lookup feature.
</P><P>They tested our <A href="/Team:CLSB-UK/Hardware" title="Team:CLSB-UK/Hardware">combined densitometer and fluorometer</A>. They found that we could hold the light sensor more securely using blue tack, or possibly superglue rather than the electrical tape we had been using. They also suggested we save a recording number rather than just whether or not a reading had been recorded and add the ability to download only the ‘recorded’ data. We implemented this, making data analysis easier and the fluorometer more powerful.
</P><P>They helped us with our <A href="/Team:CLSB-UK/HP/HS_Guide" title="Team:CLSB-UK/HP/HS Guide">high school teams guide</A> by giving us detailed feedback that we incorporated into the final guide. They gave us lots more advice for the ‘idea’ section of the guide, and helped provide us with other pertinent points for the ‘why enter,’ ‘fundraising’ and ‘equipment’ sections.

We do not have a plate reader at CLS, but Westminster kindly agreed to let us use theirs to carry out the measurements.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="What_we_did_for_them_3">What we did for them</SPAN></H3><P>We helped Carroll High School with several parts of the wiki. We first explained the way the iGEM wiki is structured and how to use Mediawiki formatting and templates. We later troubleshooted parts of their wiki, writing code to fix problems they were having in their navbar, footer and with the overall layout.

This was a great opportunity for us to present our project to others. We delivered a formal presentation, and explained our project at poster sessions. We were also able to find out more about other teams’ projects and their work.
</P><P>We were able to set up links with some of the teams there  which led to some of our collaborations. In addition, it was useful to talk to other teams with more experience and get advice on things like poster design or presentation skills.
