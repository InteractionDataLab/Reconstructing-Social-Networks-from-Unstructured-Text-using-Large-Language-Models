Human Practices Summary
Our team was motivated to examine problems of distributive justice in modern medicine and biotechnology. We wanted to find flaws in the current distribution scheme of medicine, especially in areas of the world lacking in infrastructure. At the same time we wanted to educate the public as well as figures with particular agency, about modern advances and issues in synthetic biology and biotechnology. To these ends we talked with experts in Mozambique health services, and offered a brief introductory class on genetic engineering and synthetic biology to Boston area high-school students.
