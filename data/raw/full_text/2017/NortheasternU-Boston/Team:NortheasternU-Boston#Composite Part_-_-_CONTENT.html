</P><P>New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts (like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).</P><H3>Best Composite Part Special Prize</H3><P>New BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts. For example, Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators, Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to <A href="http://parts.igem.org/DNA_Submission">Registry sample submission guidelines</A> and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Judging/Awards">special prize</A>, make sure you add your part number to your <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Judging/Judging_Form">judging form</A> and delete the box at the top of this page.

<B>Please note:</B> Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize. </P><DIV class="highlight"><H4>Note</H4><P>This page should list all the composite parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Composite Part award, so put your best part first!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
