From the start, our iGEM team wanted to do something to address questions of
distributive justice. That is, we wanted our project to advance an idea that
could help bring the power of modern biotechnology and synthetic biology to the
broadest group of people possible. This is why we chose to work on a paper-based project,
especially since paper has already been used and deployed to address biomedical
issues in low-resource areas.
</P><P>
Working with paper has many advantages, including low cost, ease of transport,
and chemical stability. However, designing a solution with paper meant first
understanding the root of the problem. Here we chose to focus on Mozambique because
we had connections to experts with deep experience in the structure of the healthcare
system and clinical experience in clinics around the country and region.
We spoke to Ruth Bechtel, Mozambique Country Director of Village Reach,
an organization that works to improve health systems capacity and efficiency through
improvements in supply chain logistics, about the structure and function of the Mozambican
healthcare system. We also spoke to Kebba Jobarteh, a clinician and healthcare
entrepreneur with decades experience in southern African health systems,
about healthcare structure, as well as his experience working in clinics
in Malawi and Mozambique. Given the dearth of data concerning healthcare questions
in Mozambique, we relied heavily on the experiences and descriptions of the experts
with whom we spoke for information on these issues.
</P><P>
Below is an account of what we learned from our research and conversations,
how that learning influenced our design ideas on how to address these issues,
and how we contributed to growing connections between researchers in the lab
and experts in the field.
</P><H3 id="Logistics">Logistics in Mozambique</H3><P>
When it comes to healthcare systems in Mozambique, <U>“most issues are logistical,
or stem from a lack of knowledge</U>,” says Ruth Bechtel. To better address the
question of how a paper-based system could alleviate some of the issues,
we first sought to understand the structure of the Mozambican healthcare system.
</P><P>
The logistical system for import and distribution of biologics in Mozambique
consists of three main systems :
</P><P>
“The problems begin at the point of purchase,” says Kebba Jobarteh.
The vast majority of pharmaceuticals in the Mozambican health system are purchased
from India, where there is variable quality control and reliability.
They are transported on boats, where storage conditions are also known to be variable,
which can damage the product. When they arrive in Mozambique,
they are stored in a centralized warehouse in the capital Maputo. Notably,
there is no facility for testing the quality of the imported products.
</P><P>
From the central warehouse, the products are transported to the district level
in refrigerated trucks, which offers another opportunity for spoilage ;
many biologics, such as vaccines, have strict storage requirements,
and can spoil if frozen (<A href="http://www.who.int/immunization/documents/IIP2015_Module2.pdf" target="_blank">
  http://www.who.int/immunization/documents/IIP2015_Module2.pdf</A>).
“We had to teach healthcare workers that the vaccines should not come in contact
with the cold packs, in order to avoid freezing and spoiling them,”
describes Ms. Bechtel. Village Reach also worked to improve awareness of
simple tests for whether or not the vaccines had frozen beyond the point of safety,
such as the shake test. If a vial has frozen and thawed, shaking the vial will
show the solution is cloudy, and that the vial is unfit for use.
</P><P>
From the district level, samples are once again transported by truck to individual
facilities, which are fraught with their own set of cold-chain, logistical, and training problems
</P><H3 id="Facility">Facility-level Storage and Administration</H3><P>
As imperfect as the logistic system is, many problems arise only once biologics
have reached facility-level. Storage conditions at the level of the individual
clinic vary enormously, from facilities with good electrical and refrigeration
infrastructure to more remote clinics with only unreliable solar or generator power.
</P><P>
A lack of training and information exacerbate these problems at the facility level.
Undertrained and overworked staff often miss small details that can impact the
effectiveness of a medication. One common issue that Village Reach found was
that staff were leaving medication out of refrigeration for too long, resulting
in spoiling.
</P><H3 id="At-home">At-Home Storage</H3><P>
Beyond even the “last mile” of biologic delivery and storage, a final hurdle
exists between having a medication in hand and treating a patient. When a patient
is prescribed a regular medication or treatment regimen, often they are given
the medicine to take home, store, and use as directed. However, this raises two
more problems : inadequate cold storage and inadequate instructions for administration.
</P><P>
This poses a troubling ethical question for clinicians and medical professionals
in the field: Should they prescribe or dispense medication if they think or know
that it will not be used safely? This is a decision that no medical professional
should have to make, especially not in a day and age when we have the technology
to completely obviate such questions. The real need, then, is to design solutions
using relevant technologies that can directly address these problems.
</P><H3 id="Paper">Paper Can Help Overcome Storage and Information</H3><P>
Paper-based cell-free products help address the multitude of issues facing
Mozambican healthcare in two ways: they can be a source of biologics and
contain instructions on how to use them safely.
</P><P>
The stability of the paper systems (Pardee et al. 2016) obviates the need for the
most stringent transportation and storage conditions. While paper still
must be handled carefully, and could not be exposed to high heat for extended
periods, it is a much more flexible and forgiving substrate. This increased
flexibility would help reduce losses along the logistic pipeline and help ensure
the quality of the final product delivered to patients.
</P><P>
Coupling the actual biologics with information on how to use them compounds
the impact of both. One cannot travel without the other, and if the paper system
is well-designed, the end user will never be without the information they need
to safely and correctly use the product. This could help both the healthcare
professional in the clinic to administer and store the product correctly,
and the patient at home to do the same.
</P><P>
As an example of what a paper-based therapy for home use might look like,
we created a mock-up of a <I>Kaletra</I> treatment passport for individual, long-term use.
<I>Kaletra</I> is an HIV medication used to slow the progression of the disease.
It is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, two protease inhibitors that are
the standard of care for suppressing HIV activity and are known to be the best
combination medication for treating children.
</P><P>
The draft booklet shown above is meant to be given to the patient by the prescribing
doctor, who would fill in the details about the number of tablets per day, and
any other notes they wish to include. The patient would drip water onto the target,
which would initiate the reaction. They would then secure it against their body
for the specified time, then simply consume the paper.
</P><P>
The title page contains paper sensors to indicate if the product has been damaged
with heat or water. It contains a unique barcode for identification and inventory.
The names of the doctor and patient can be written in on the front page,
as well as the date of the prescription.
</P><P>
The first page inside contains instructions in Portuguese, Mozambique’s official
language, and English. The instructions are simple and easy to follow, meant
to give the patient only as much information as they need to successfully
consume the medication.
</P><P>
The remaining pages are use pages. They are meant to be hydrated, cut, and
consumed by the patient. The design of the page is simple and the images on
the page are easily understood. Each line contains a slot for the date to be
written, to help the patient keep track of how much medication they have taken
and when. One issue of the system is to contain the reaction to a specified area.
This can be achieved by including a wax ring that does not allow water to
permeate, and can also help seal in the reaction when the page is folded over.
</P><P>
The whole booklet contains holes on the left side to allow multiple medications
in similar booklets to be stored in the same binder along with all of their
instructions for use.
