SAFETY
1. What is the Safety Level of your lab?
Level 1 (low risk)
· Equivalent to ordinary microbiology laboratory
· windows and doors will be closed during the experiment
· sterilization facilities effective for microorganisms is provided in the laboratory
Level 2 (moderate risk)
(In addition to the P1 level specification)
· Installation of safety cabinet
· Installation of autoclave
· Display of 'P2 level experiment in progress' at laboratory entrance
Level 3 (high risk)
(In addition to the P2 level specification)
· installation of front room for clothes changing, construction which front and back doors could not be open at the same time
· Installation of an exhaust ventilation system designed to allow air to flow from the front room to the experiment area
· Installation of a hand washer that can be operated with feet at the exit, installation of floor, wall and ceiling made with material which is easy to clean
Level 4 (extreme risk)
(In addition to P3 level specification)
· Exclusive buildings or clearly partitioned experimental partitions with others
· Installation of Class III safety cabinet (glove box)
· Install shower room in front room
· Installation of double-sided (cannot be open at the same time) autoclave etc.
· Installing a dedicated supply / exhaust device (with alarm device) for    experiment area, maintenance of negative pressure
· Construction to prevent reverse flow of water supply pipes
We usually do our experiment at P1 laboratory.
2. Which work areas do you use to handle biological materials? Please check all that apply.
Our experiments were done in the level 1 laboratory. We used clean bench to prevent contamination such as dust and floating microorganisms when performing inoculation work. When using clean bench, we removed accessories such as watch, rolled up our sleeves to elbows, and disinfected our hands and equipment used in the experiment with 70 percent ethanol. We also autoclaved and sterilized with high pressure steam, to prevent leakage of genetically modified E.coli out of the laboratory and autoclaved chips and micro-tubes to prevent contamination.
3. Please briefly describe the topics that you learned about (or will learn about) in your safety training.
Team members are safely trained in all aspects in the department's experimental lessons, including safety rules, safety facilities, and how to deal with emergency situations. For example, we learned how to use the eye-washer and emergency shower. Emergency contact information which correspondence is written are always affixed about correspondence at the time of fire occurrence. In addition, we got a lecture on the contents of Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and Japanese law on safety management in conducting genetic modification experiments.
4. In your country / region, what are the laws and regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
In Japan, it is stipulated by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. The link below is the link of the institution's homepage.
