Genes used to create this system
When it is inserted into E.coli, and when IL-10 is received, same thing will occurs. IL-10 receptor is activated and STAT 1 phosphorylates. Phosphorylated STAT1 will form a dimer, then binds to the GFAP promoter, and transcription starts.
Therefore, to let IL-12 be transport out of the cell, gene is insert to the downstream of the GFAP promoter.
HlyA is a signal peptide to carries IL-12 out of the cell.
In this way, the IL-10 produced can be transported outside the cell.
