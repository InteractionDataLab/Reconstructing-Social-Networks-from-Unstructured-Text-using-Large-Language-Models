Plasmid 1
IL-10Receptor, STAT1 and JAK are cloned to produce plasmid 1.
Figure below shows colonies observation images obtained by binding all genes, placing them in pSB1C3 and transforming them into DH5α.
Picture of agar gel electrophoresis result of plasmid extraction from the obtained colony is shown in figure below.
From figure above, we can confirm that the plasmid obtained is consistent with the molecular weight targeted.
Plasmid 2
Total: about 7443bp
In order to create plasmid 2 (4 patterns), GFAPpromoter, HlyD, HlyB, TolC, and HlyA + IL-12 or GFP were cloned.
This four plasmids has the same molecular weight.
The four figure below shows colony observation image obtained by binding all genes and inserts them in pSB1C3 and transforms them into DH5α.
Agarose gel electrophoresis result of plasmid extraction from the obtained colonies is shown in figure below.
From figure above, we can confirm that all the plasmids obtained are plasmid 2 since the molecular weight is consistent with the molecular weight targeted.
