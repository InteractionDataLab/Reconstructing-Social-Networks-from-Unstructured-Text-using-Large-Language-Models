In each DNA sequence, restriction enzyme sequence and primer sequence were designed like Biobrick Part and were synthesized by IDT. Since we wished to use this Plasmid to control the expression, a human-derived GFAP promoter was used as the promoter. And since it was impossible to determine whether the HlyA signal peptide should be added before or after the gene, it was not possible to judge whether it should be added before or after the gene, so that the signal peptide was added before and after the signal peptide.</DD><DD>In addition, Plasmid which IL-12 is changed to GFP, was also prepared to simplify functional tests.<D>GFP versions of plasmid were prepared by changing the position to which Hly A was added.</D></DD><DD>For demonstration,</DD></DL></MAIN><DL><DD>The two plasmids prepared are transformed into JM 109 and functional test is carrying out.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:KAIT_JAPAN/demonstrate">Demonstrate</A><SMALL><SPAN><SPAN class="mail">Contact: <A href="mailto:kaitjapan@gmail.com">kaitjapan@gmail.com</A></SPAN><SPAN>Twitter:<A href="https://twitter.com/kait_japan">@KAIT_JAPAN</A></SPAN></SPAN></SMALL></DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
