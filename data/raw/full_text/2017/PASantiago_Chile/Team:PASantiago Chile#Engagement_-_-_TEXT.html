“Expanding the knowledge”
Our team realized the little knowledge that students have about the topic about synthetic  biology, due to the fact that it is not included in the curriculum of each school in our  country. For that reason, as a high school team, we were convinced that synthetic  biology and genetic engineering were topics that not only the scientists were capable to  handle, also students were capable to discuss these topics.   To achieve this goal, we perform different talks in schools, teaching differents topics  about synthetic biology: What is it? In what is present? As well as we motivate students  of 9 to 12 grade to participate in the same talks, where they asked various questions  creating a dynamic and interactive environment for the learning about this topic.
The number of students who got this talk were 623. Also likewise we expect that this  number to increase and expand all around the country.
Also among the activities that we carry out, we invite to students to work in our  laboratory, where they made simples manipulations of DNA, generating that they were  interested and involved more these issues making this activity was more significant and  useful for them.
The most important and rewarding thing during this process was the chance to teach  and bring personalized science classes to as many students as we could. awakening  a  new scientific curiosity to many of the students who were present in our activities,  motivating them to explore different areas of science and how beneficial it can be to  solve big problems that we have every day.
In these talks we collect all the signatures of the students, professors and guests  represented in the following graphics and photographs:
