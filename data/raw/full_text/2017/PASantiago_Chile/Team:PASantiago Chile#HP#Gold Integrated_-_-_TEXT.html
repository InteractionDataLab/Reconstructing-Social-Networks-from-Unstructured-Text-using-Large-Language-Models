Human practice
In the time that we approached to the biology (Approx. 3 years), we enquired in diversity areas, such as:
Synthetic biology
Biotechnology
Genetic engineering
Bioinformatic
Biology of systems
Our work has been both theoretical and practical. In the latter, we can emphasize our work in the laboratory of genomic and bioinformatics of the Universidad Mayor, which counts with instruments, tools and advanced devices for the development of practical skills.
In the time that we have been working in our project, we carry out the following activities:
Theoretical training :
Scientific fair in the Universidad Mayor, seat Huechuraba, Santiago
Scientific Fair at the Gabriela Mistral Cultural Center (GAM)
Participation in "X Technology Fair" at the National Interactive Museum (MIM)
National competition “Explora”
Presentations of synthetic biology and our project for the diffusion.
