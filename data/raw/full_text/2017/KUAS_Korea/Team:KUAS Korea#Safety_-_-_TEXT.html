Safety
We have thoughtfully considered the safety issues during our whole lab project. Details are as follows.
1. Members of two-component regulatory system HssS/HssR are highly unlikely to be dangerous. They function as heme response acceptor and activate the expression of hrtAB, an efflux pump that indicates hemin and detoxifies heme stress. They are expressed in a strain of Bacillus cereus, which is classified as risk group 2.
2. HrtR protein is unlikely to be hazardous. It is an intracellular heme-binding protein which controls heme efflux by the conserved HrtAB transporter. They are expressed in a strain of Lactococcus lactis, which is classified as risk group 1.
3. Bacillus cereus KCTC3624 is a dangerous pathogenic species that produce toxin. It could cause food poisoning, vomiting, and diarrhea. This risky pathogen is classified as risk group 2.
4. Lactobacillus plantarum L67 is a nonpathogenic species which is classified as risk group 1. This bacteria is responsible for the fermentative conversion of sugars in raw materials into lactic acid. It is commonly found in dairy, meat, vegetable fermentations and human gastrointestinal tract.
All of the chemicals we use are not dangerous. However, we deal with dangerous pathogenic organism B.cereus as a chassis. In order to protect ourselves, we always use gloves for protection and wear lab coats. We also always sterilize our experiment tools and biological materials to prevent the dispersion of hazardous materials.
