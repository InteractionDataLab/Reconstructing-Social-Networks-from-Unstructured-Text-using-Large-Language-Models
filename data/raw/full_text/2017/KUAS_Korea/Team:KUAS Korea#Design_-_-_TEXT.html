Detection System 1: HssR/S Mechanism
The HssR and HssS mechanism of our project is as follows.
① If intestinal bleeding occurs for a variety of reasons, blood leak into the bowel.
② When heme in the blood binds to the HssS protein, it phosphorylates histidine 249 through autophosphorylation.
③ HssS transfers the phosphate group from its histidine 249 to aspartate 52 of HssR using transphosphorylation.
④ The phosphorylated HssR binds to the direct repeat sequence of the hrtAB promoter and initiates the reporter’s transcription.
Detection System 2: HrtR Mechanism
Also, the mechanism of heme detection using HrtR protein is as follows.
① If intestinal bleeding occurs for a variety of reasons, blood leak into the bowel.
② When heme binds to the HrtR protein, HrtR binds to the promoter in front of the hrtR sequence and promotes its own transcription.
③ The reporter behind the hrtR sequence is transcribed together to determine the presence of heme detection.
