During our lab work, we managed to do 3 constructions:
pmyo2::GFP pmyo3::unc-60::RFP pmyo3::unc60::GFP These 3 constructions xere microinjected in worms under the microscope. Pmyo2::GFP is used as a brenchmark in order to know if our worms were well injected. The promoter pmyo2 is tissue specific, it allows the expression of the gene myo-2 in the pharynx of the C.elegans. Thanks to the green fluorescent pharynx, we can screen transformed worms from non transformed worms. The two others constructions, pmyo3::unc-60::RFP and pmyo3::unc60::GFP, will allow us to see how the two different isoforms unc-60A (RFP) and unc-60B (GFP) are expressed in the body wall muscle. Here are a few pictures about what we obtained under the microscope.
Fed worm GFP
Fed worm RFP
Starving worm GFP
Starving worm RFP
We observed the worms under two conditions: starved and non-starved worms. C.elegans eats the bacteria and fungi. When there are no more bacteria on the petri dish, the worms are starved. It can be useful to see if the starvation can change a phenotype, as the worm can be adaptive.
