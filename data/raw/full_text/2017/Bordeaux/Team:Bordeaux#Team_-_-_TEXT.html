Our Supervisors
Denis DUPUY
Denis DUPUY is a Research officer (CR1) at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). He works at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology on tools and methods needed to perform systematic analysis of spatiotemporal gene expression in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans.
Marie BEURTON-AIMAR
Marie BEURTON-AIMAR is is the head of the Bioformatics Master of Bordeaux University. She is also a Research officer at the Bordeaux Laboratory of Research and Informatics (LaBRI) and works on the modeling and simulation of biochemical reactions and on the processing and analysis of biological images.
The members
Christian Te, 24
aka "The ninja"
You may notice him or not, but he is somewhere. He likes to understand how things works, so naturally he turns to sciences. Actually he is in the last year of the Master in Bioinformatics. It is his second year in IGEM adventure full of twists and turns, this time as an advisor. To be versatile and multi-task is a need, to chill out too! Have a question? Ask him, he may not knows the answer, but he knows who to ask for.
Marguerite Batsale, 21
aka "Gwyneth Paltrow"
Attention to this blonde woman, behind her laughter and her jumps in all direction hide a real president. Approved in agrosciences Master's degree, she considers the competition as challenge which we can reach in team. She is always here to help and have always a lot of energy. If you ask her what Igem provides her, she will answer a kick up the backside.
Hey, Jesus ! Where are the claims ?
Jean Descarpentrie, 24
aka "Stephen Merchant"
After 3 years of participation in the competition, Jean is just a bit like a dean for the team. However this instructor still does not need hip prosthesis. He likes to define a scientific as a wizard who find solutions whose muggles are not aware. If you don’t know where he is, you can go at La Grange (an habitual bar of the crazy members of the team), where he will welcome you yelling, a glass of mead in the hand.
Before my life was to stop at the stop sign and wait for it to turn green.
I did not expect anything but I'm still disappointed.
Estelle Lesbros, 22
aka "Dragonette"
Do not rely on its Cannes origin, Estelle is sociable and friendly. When she doesn’t talk about Imagine Dragons or Harry Potter, you will discover a person curious and open to the different fields of science. But beware, her true personality comes out in her natural habitat, in the sun or in a laboratory of genetics, where you can see her dancing, singing and saying mainly bullshit.
I’m not crazy, my mother has make me tests
Bazinga !
To forget, do you want I forget ? This brain don't forget. I never forget anything since my mother stopped breastfeeding me. It was a Tuesday and it was raining.
Julia Gaboriaud, 22
aka "Hattie Morahan"
Budding geneticist, you’ll find rigor and kindness in this young woman. Not able to decide which of Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff the best house is, she loves to work in a caring environment. With her presence, such as a BBC actress, she defends her ideas brilliantly in every debate. When we have doubts or questions, no need for Doctor Who, we know who to contact to reassure us.
Allons-y, Alonzo !
Julien Benetti, 22
aka "Brad Depp"
If you ask this young man to explain you the synthesis biology, he will simply answer “ it’s biology that you make”.  Julien knew how to combine his computer video game passion with biology by realizing a bioinformatic master degree. He has the charisma of Brad Pitt mingled with the madness of Johnny Depp, which gives the perfect mix for a mad scientist.
Who has two thumbs and who cares ? Bob Kelso !
When something changes it reminds you that you are always the same.
Guillaume Beucher, 23
aka "Elijah Woodt"
Jazz lover and singular cooker, Guillaume wakes up the lab every morning by whistling.  It must be said that he managed to survive in a full-woman laboratory for two months. His favorite instrument is none other than the saxophone but in a laboratory, he knows how to manage the PCR. By his hobbies, he reconciles the perseverance of sportsmen and the patience of the figurinists.
Real is just a matter of perception.
Alexandre Bosdonnat, 24
aka "Joseph Fiennes"
A handsome speaker, this young man is the Shakespeare of the team. He knows how to turn phrases and talk about science. According to him, each person is an actor in his own setting.
Now say my name !
Remy Viannais, 23
aka "Josh Radnor"
This biochemist converted into  a bioinformatician. Fan of science, he thinks above all that the knowledge is life. For that, he tries to have all knowledge in all scientist fields even though his brain has struggles to follow. So, Rémy is a little shy but very kind. Established sportsman, he also plays the guitar time to time.
Marie Didelon, 23
aka "Kristen Dunst"
This great Lorraine knows how to be festive. Indeed, she is very friendly which makes her a superb Hufflepuff, but she can show the characteristic courage of the Gryffindors. She has proved to be a very good Game Master during role games, which helps to explain why she is the team leader this year. Curious, it’s been two years since she participates in the competition. She seeks to know how things work and is very interested in the Tardigrade.
Amara ikrame
aka "Dreamer"
Spending more time in space then in earth, ikram is the dreamer of the team. If you need crazy ideas, she will always be there to help. Full of love, happiness, and positive attitude, she loves to render services against a hug! After spending so much time in C.Elegans company, she is even capable to talk there language! Crazy, don’t you thinks!
Fatma Saleck, 23
studying Biology at Bordeaux University. She is doing her my second year in the iGEM adventure. She engaged in this adventure for the second time because she likes biology and the concept of iGEM, concretize an idea within a team. She learned so much while working with this team and had some fun moments.
Gary Bouchentouf
aka "Elon Muscle"
Gary is a punchy and passionate dude. Behind the 6 packs he has the pack instinct. A meere contact and you immediately feel comfortable talking to him. But he can also be frank and push you toward your goals. If there was one word to describe him it would be “leader”. He has the knack for making contacts and convincing people into doing things, not through manipulation but motivation. He knows how to surround himself with talented people and to bring up the talent that lies within yourself. He really understands what are sacrifices and does not hesitate to go through them to reach a bigger goal.
Don't be upset with the result you didn't get from the  work you didn't do - Eric Thomas
Thomas Maucourt
aka "The nerd"
This 5ft11 sturdy man is the more relaxed you have ever seen. You will often find him enjoying his sweaty electronic cigarette, while focusing and working on projects. Passionate about science and computer science, you can feel all his passion when you talk with him. He is always trying to get how things work, getting deeper and deeper in the heart of things. And every time, he succeeds. Despite this, he knows when to take a break, and when it comes about having fun, he is there.
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn - Benjamin Franklin
Pierre Ortalo
aka "The machine"
We are actually talking about the most interested guy ever, everything attracts him. It is amazing, whatever the subject, science, computer science, health, theater, music, time managment, even business… He is always finding a way to learn more about such topics. There is two possibilities, either he is reading books to cultivate himself, or he is planning to on his bullet journal (an other tip that he has learned from his personnal lectures), when he is not already working. Pierre is a clever student, nothing resists to him, he pushes through everything. Adding his serious and investment in every project he undertakes, it makes him THE asset. Even when it is about enjoying beer and chilling, he is the king of improvisation and will make you enjoying the evenning !
Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee? ― Albert Camus
Savandara Besse
aka "The mother Pika "
As a real mother, she dotes us. Feel a bit bad? Go talk to her and her angelic smile will comfort you. With a wealth of experience in IGEM competition, she provides us many useful tips on many aspects. She is always doing few things at the same time and master everything, she is untiring.. She remote supported us from Harvard, and wanna innovate in Bioinformatics domains. She will leave us to perform a phD in Canada, but will always be in our heart and keep in touch. She is the best magikarp trainer ever.
Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. ― Marie Curie
