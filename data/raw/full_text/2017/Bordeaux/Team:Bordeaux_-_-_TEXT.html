Background
Since its characterisation in 1981, alternative splicing is a well-known mechanism. Indeed this mechanism has been very important in understanding the complexity of genetics. Alternative splicing is how different mRNA are expressed, due to different splicing sites being used, by the cell depending on the different environmental conditions, the cell type, or the state of cell differentiation.   Alternative splicing has been observed in C.Elegans, more precisely, in the unc-60 gene of the ADF/cofilin family, which has been described as encoding two tissue-specific isoforms, one for muscular tissues, and the other for non-muscular tissues. The synthesis of these two isoforms is regulated by two proteins, ASD-2 and SUP-12, which control the alternative splicing of the unc-60 gene.
Description
This year, IGEM bordeaux aims to study the alternative splicing of the unc-60 gene in C.elegans. In order to control the alternative splicing of this gene, it is important to control the synthesis of proteins involved in it’’s splicing. On the one hand, we want to make a photo-inducible system that will use on the two promoters of regulatory proteins ASD2 and SUP12. On the other hand, we aim to use another system called the Q system allowing more precise control of the regulatory proteins of the unc-60 gene. We also aim to create a microfluidic system to observe the results of these genetic modifications on C. elegans.
