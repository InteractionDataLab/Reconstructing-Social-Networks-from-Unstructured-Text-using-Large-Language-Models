It’s better home made to learn
This year, IGEM Bordeaux restart again with C.elegans for new adventures and a new team composed by 17 students. We worked together through the year to realize our project and everyone contributed by doing specific works. We divided the group in three. One for the scientific part and laboratory experiments, a second for the informatic part of our project and a last for all sides.
The laboratory
First, we want to thank the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology for hosting us all the year for our interships and meetings.
We would like to thank the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology (IECB) for hosting us and supporting us all the year for our interships and meetings.
In this Institute, many professionals used to advise us during our internships and to lend us machines to work on our project. Thank you to:
Florian Bernard, Phd student in Denis Dupuy’s team, for all his advises and all the time he took to explain us how to operate in a laboratory. We would like to add special thanks for his good mood and jokes.
Axel Innis's group, for lending us their NanoDrop instrument.
Lionel Beaurepaire and Myriam Mederic, from the IECB's technology platform in preparative and analytical techniques. They gave us encouragements all along the internships and lend us their thermocycler.
Natacha Perebaskine from Axel Innis’ group,for telling us how to behave in the lab and in the institute in case of accident and for all the safety information she gave us.
Esther MARZA, lecturer in the University of Bordeaux and member of Rémi Fronzes team, for allowing us to take part in the « Fête de la Science » workshops in order to make children discover a little bit of science.
Our Team
PI
Dr. Denis Dupuy, Primary PI, We thank him a lot for everything, iGEM Bordeaux would be nothing without his hard work.
Pr. Marie Beurton Aimar , Secondary PI, Thank to her for her advice on the bioinformatic part of the project.
Team Members
Thomas Maucourt, Estelle Lesbros, Alexandre Bosdonnat, Peter Bock, Julia Gaboriaud, Nancy Randria, Cécilia Ostertag, Ikram Amara, Rémy Viannais, Pierre Ortalo, Julien Benetti, Guillaume Beucher.
They worked hard all along the year to realise their project.
Instructors & Team leader
Jean Descarpentrie, Instructor. He helped us to work en C.elegans by giving us protocols and interesting scientific papers. He was there at each meeting to give us advices.
Savandara Besse , Instructor. She gave us a precious help to understand all the aspects of the competition. She also helped to find the title of the project and imagined the project’s logo.
Gary Bouchentouf, Team Leader. He took care of the sponsoring a lot, worked on the bioinformatic part of the project and the team management.
Advisors
Marguerite Batsale, Marie Didelon, Fatma Saleck and Christian Té.
They supported the team thanks to their experience in the IGEM competition.
Work Repartitions
Experimental strategy
Jean Descarpentrie supervised and gave many advices on the injection of our different genetic constructions and on the lab work.
Estelle Lesbros, Julia Gaboriaud, Miriam Amara and Guillaume Beucher  and Alexandre Bosdonnat designed all the DNA primers and several approachs for the realization of the lab work.
Guillaume Beucher, Alexandre Bosdonnat, Fatma Saleck and Marguerite Batsale worked on the experimental strategy.
Special thanks to Nicolas Boisset who gave a lot of support and advices to us, in order to help us to realise our project.
Bioinformatics
Julien Benetti and Cécilia Ostertag proposed many ideas towards a better analyse of our worms.
Gary Bouchentouf, Thomas Maucourt and Pierre Ortalo worked on the sofware part. An RNA-Seq pipeline from May to October.
Labwork
Estelle Lesbros and Guillaume Beucher worked during July.
Estelle Lesbros, Nancy Randria and Guillaume Beucher worked during August.
Marguerite Batsale provided many advices and help, supervising all the experimentations.
Wiki
Christian Té and Rémy Viannais worked on the conception of the wiki page.
Rémy Viannais worked hard on the layout coding of the wiki and wrote the text about attributions and a first description of the project.
Gary Bouchentouf, Thomas Maucourt and Pierre Ortalo wrote the entire bioinformatic part.
Estelle Lesbros and Rémy Viannais wrote the team part.
Julien Benetti read many times the wiki to correct mistakes.
Estelle Lesbros and Peter Bock wrote the text about the team members.
Ikram Amarawrote about Human Practices.
Sponsoring and communication
Marguerite Batsale and Gary Bouchentouf looked for money in order to make laboratory experiment and let the team going to Boston.
Peter Bock and Estelle Lesbros took care about communication through our facebook page and Twitter account.
Special thanks to Amélie Laporte for the design of our logo and Savandara Besse for her help on the sponsoring folder.
Events
Gary Bouchentouf was the speaker on the first event.
Marie Didelon and Christian Té were the speakers for the second event.
Fatma Saleck helped the team to find speakers in order to debate on a specific  subject.
Marguerite Batsalehelped to organise each event.
Poster and presentation
Thomas Maucourt, Guillaume Beucher, Gary Bouchentouf and Pierre Ortalo prepared the presentation together with support of the rest of the team.
Rémy Viannais and Alexandre Bosdonnat worked on the first edition of our poster.
Thomas Maucourt and the rest of the team worked on the last edition of the poster.
Special Thanks to:
Nicolas Delattre who designed our poster for our conference about CRISPR-Cas9. He also designed a sponsoring booklet to help in seeks funding
Amélie Laporte who helped us to make our facebook banner for the event page about our conference about CRISPR-Cas9.
AEBBCB student association for students in Biology in the University of Bordeaux, for inviting us in order to talk about the IGEM Competition.
AMBB student association in bioinformatics, for helping us to organise events in the University.
Marc Chevalier from Talence innovation for supporting us and giving advices.
