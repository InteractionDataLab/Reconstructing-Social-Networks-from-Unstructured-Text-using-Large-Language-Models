SAFETY
Our project is axed to experimental studies on c.elegans. We choose to work on these tiny microscopic worms because in nature there are harmless to humans and the environment as you can learn from our guide of the C.Elegans. During our experiments, we worked on a same line of C.Elegans. Each worms used during the experiments were destroyed after getting results, putting then in alcohol and bleach.  We extracted our genes of interest to make our biobricks from N. crassa. This bacterium is also naturally harmless to humans and the environment.  The genome modifications that we have induced can be transmitted only by precise micro-injections in our C.Elegans.  Of course, these manipulations need to be done with a respect of the safety rules that will allow a good progress of the experiments.  In the laboratory, we must be attentive, and a good organization is indispensable for the well doing of our manipulations.  We have therefore programmed all our experiments to be better prepared and give us the time to fully understand all the steps necessary for the success of our operations.  We followed the essential rules that govern a laboratory, starting with wearing the famous white blouse.  As we manipulate DNA and living matter, we also take the gloves out of their boxes.  To avoid contamination of our samples, we worked under extractor wood. To avoid breathing more harmful gas, these were of course lit.  For the manipulation of our bacteria we worked under the extraordinary laminar flow extractor wood to avoid microbial contamination of our biological samples. We also have to put the ultra glamorous safety glass’s when we handled BET during electrophoreses to observe the migration and the quality of our DNA.  And so that the following researchers are not in danger after putting upside down the lab, we put everything back to place, and disinfect every place we touched with alcohol at 70 ° (better to kill the bacteria). And before leaving, we made sure to well sorte our waste to not put endangering people who will have the task to take out the trash and especially those who treat them in specialized centers.
