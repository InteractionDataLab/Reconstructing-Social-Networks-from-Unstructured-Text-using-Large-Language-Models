The Giant Jamboree
We had an amazing experience at the Giant Jamboree in Boston and we earned a gold medal!
Medal Requirements
Bronze medal requirements
Register and attend: We Registered for iGEM , had a stunning summer full of new experiences. For some proof, visit our gallery ! We are currently very excited and looking forward to participating in the giant jamboree.
Deliverables: We delivered all of the required deliverables, and cannot wait to present our project and poster in Boston.
Attribtions: We have created a wiki page to acknowledge and thank all those that helped and supported us throughout this project. Without their help this project would not have been possible. For more information check out our attributions page
Interlab Measurement Study: We have participated in the Interlab Measurement Study .
Silver Medal Requirements
Validated Part / Validated Contribution:
We have experimentally validated the following new BioBricks and have documented their characterization in the iGEM Parts Registry:
BBa_K2520007
BBa_K2520008
Collaboration: We collaborated with 12 iGEM teams from 9 different countries. Check out our Collaboration page for more information!
Human Practices: We considered the ethical and practical implications of our project by consulting with experts from our community, and around the world, as well as interacting with the public. Have a look at our Human Practices .
Gold Medal Requirements
Integrated Human practice : We have created an ethics handbook . We consulted many experts and interacted with the public, all of which lead to important and meaningful changes within our project. For more information visit our Integrated Human Practice page
Improve a previous part or project:
We improved the following parts:
BBa_K1061015
BBa_K1119008
You can check out our improvement page for more information.
Model your project: We modeled the apoptosis of immature B cells as a result of binding to anti-IgM displaying cells. Additionally, with the aid of team Edinburgh UG, we modeled the activity of Cre-Recombinase within our cells.
Demonstrate your work : Here we show that our modular Tri-Display Plasmid works, and here We show that our system works as expected!
