Tolerance challenge
Tolerance challenge
When we began our project, we initiated a social media challenge:   We asked people from different cultural backgrounds, ethnicities, and nationalities to take pictures with a "Tolerance" sign and share them on social media. All the pictures were uploaded with the hashtag: #tolerance_challenge. The main aim of our tolerance challenge is to raise awareness and encourage discussion of tolerance within the community.The squeaky wheel get the grease, and as a result, we hear far more about what sets us apart rather than what unites us. We wanted to show that people from all backgrounds can agree upon the value of tolerance and coexistence.
On the 28.10.17 we published a final post on Facebook and Instagram explaining the connection between the value of tolerance, and our iGEM project:
“ During the last four months we have posted pictures of different individuals and communities with one common theme - "TOLERANCE". You may be thinking - What is the connection between tolerance and our iGEM project???
Well, our project is based on inducing Immune TOLERANCE using the body’s natural mechanism of Central Tolerance.
The immune system distinguishes between hostile and harmless substances. Central tolerance is crucial for maintaining this ability. Sometimes things go wrong, and the immune system will recognize our own body, or harmless substances, as hostile. In our project, we aim to use the body’s built-in system of central tolerance in order to prevent the development of autoimmune diseases and allergies.
And so, it all comes down to tolerance. Tolerance to ourselves, tolerance to allergens, and, most importantly, tolerance to each other.
Sound pretty cool huh? For more details visit our website .
In summation, our campaign was very successful. We received pictures from across the globe and positive feedback from all our followers. We hope that this challenge has inspired our followers to share and spread our vision of tolerance.
