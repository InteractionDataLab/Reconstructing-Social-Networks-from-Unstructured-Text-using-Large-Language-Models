Modelling is an important part of any project within iGEM. As part of our project, we decided to model two separate systems: We created a kinetic model for the Tolerance Assay Model, and collaborated with team Edinburgh UG in order to model a potential “Kill Switch.”
Each of these models provided us with important information that directly impacted our general design and our wet-lab experiments.
