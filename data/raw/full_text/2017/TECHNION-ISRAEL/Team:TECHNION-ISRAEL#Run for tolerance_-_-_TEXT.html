Run for tolerance
“Run for tolerance”
In order to raise awareness for the virtue of tolerance, we decided to organize a public run in which we could all come together for this common cause, without boundaries distinguishing us from one another while showing respect and acceptance for each other.
Dozens of citizens from all over the country came to support this virtue and take part in raising awareness for tolerance. This led to a fun  and meaningful event. The run was held in collaboration with the municipality, police, fire fighters, and paramedics who contributed a lot to the success, and safety, of the run.
We stretched, wormed up, put music on high volume, kept high moral and started running!
At the end of the run we took photos of all the participants along with a sign captioned "Run for tolerance" and uploaded all the photos to our social media. To summarize, the event was very successful and fulfilled its main goal: To unite people from different backgrounds under a single roof. The universal roof of tolerance.
