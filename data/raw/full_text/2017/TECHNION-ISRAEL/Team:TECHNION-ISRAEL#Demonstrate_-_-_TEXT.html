Assay
In an attempt to show proof of concept we set out to test our system under realistic conditions. Ideally we would have tested our constructs in-vivo for tolerance      induction [1] .      This, unfortunately, was not possible within the framework of iGEM, as animal experimentation is generally discouraged, and the time frame did not allow for an animal experimentation ethics permit.
In light of these considerations, our team has worked very hard to develop an effective and novel in-vitro assay for tolerance induction.
