Part Improvements
We have improved two existing parts in an attempt to increase their utility to the iGEM community.
We improved the existing part ( BBa_K1119008 ) - a device containing the GFP reporter gene under the CMV promoter with an hGH poly A terminator. By replacing the CMV promoter with TRE promoter ( BBa_K2520006 ) we have created a convenient and important positive control for TRE based inducible systems.
Additionally, in our project we used the existing tTA transactivator part ( BBa_K1061015 )  to test our Delay Mechanism . To use this basic part, we had to clone it into a mammalian expression vector, requiring time and effort.
In order to save future teams time, we have improved this part ( BBa_K2520009 ) by adding a promoter (CMV) and a terminator (hGH poly A). Additionally, we tested this part and characterized it.
