Part Collection
Meet our "Optimized Mammalian Display Collection"- the collection that will make displaying proteins on the cellular membrane of mammalian cells easy and efficient. During our project we optimized our own membrane display system, and as a result, we created three new basic parts and multiple devices to allow for the display of any recombinant protein future iGEM teams may want.
Within our collection you will find modular plasmids that can display up to three different proteins on the cellular membrane, and in equimolar levels. These plasmids have been submitted with multiple promoters- an inducible promoter and strong mammalian promoters, in order to allow for more versatile and application specific uses (figure 1). You can also find plasmids that constrictively, or inductively, express the GFP reporter gene for positive controls and transfection efficiency quantification.
Figure 1: You can choose between 3 different promoters to achieve both a constitutive and an inducible expression.
As a part of our collection, we submitted three new basic parts for strong and consistent display of proteins on the membrane- Mutated EF1a promoter ( BBa_K2520023 ) for strong mammalian expression, Secrecon ( BBa_K2520002 )- the most powerful and consistent human secretion signal sequence (figure 2) and B7-1 ( BBa_K2520000 ), a trans-membrane domain that anchors proteins to the membrane with tremendous efficiency (figure 3).
Figure 2: You can change the secretion signal sequence from IgK-leader to Secrecon.
Figure 3: You can change the trans-membrane domain from PDGFR to B7-1.
We believe that this internally complete collection will be easy to use, and beneficial to future iGEM teams.
