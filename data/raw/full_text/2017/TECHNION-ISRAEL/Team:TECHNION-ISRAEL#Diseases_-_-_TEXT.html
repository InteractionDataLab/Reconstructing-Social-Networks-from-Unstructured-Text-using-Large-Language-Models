Diseases & Epitopes
There are hundreds of autoimmune and allergic diseases. They have a tremendous effect on people’s lives, and exact a heavy financial and emotional cost.  In our project, we chose to focus on five specific diseases. We chose these diseases because they are familiar and very different in their pathophysiology, thus demonstrating both the pertinence, and modularity, of our proposed treatment.

Epitopes
An Epitope is the part of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells.
Below are the epitopes we used to prevent the diseases we focused on.
