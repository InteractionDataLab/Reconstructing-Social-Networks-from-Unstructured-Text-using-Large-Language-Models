SSTi-SZGD
SMS-Shenzhen
Shenzhen-SFLS
This year we made a long-term collaboration with SSTi-SZGD. We helped them to build a team and figure out how to participate in this competition, including team management, details of competition, and experiment protocols. In return, they helped us test enzyme activity of CA and plot standard curves using two different methods.
You can see the results here.
In summerï¼Œwe shared our laboratories with a high school iGEM team SMS-Shenzhen for they could not get into their campus during summer vacation. Furthermore, we also gave them some directions on experiments, involving transformation, ultrasonication and so on. Reciprocally, they helped us with regulating lab and data processing. We also helped team Shenzhen-SFLS with project model.
Bit
We were invited to BIT campus for a deep bilateral communication and we interchanged not only the designs of our projects but also our experience on the iGEM competition, which was of great help in improving our project. BIT-China was invited to alpha test for our website Corridor, making their efforts in establish a platform of all iGEMers. We assisted them in setting up their wiki.
SCU-WestChina
Before CCiC, we exchanged our experience and knowlodge of Bacillus subtilis on how to incubate those bacteria. We interchanged our protocols with SCU-WestChina, and helped them with transformations.
NCTU_Formosa
We invited NCTU_Formosa to be a member of Corridor, and also got invited by them to use their Parabase, a software aiming at predicting potential antifungal peptides, searching validated antifungal peptides, and finding the relationship between fungal pathogen, their host species and target peptides. We hope that Parabase can be a useful tool in synthetic biology.
