                                            <STRONG>A1</STRONG>: Bridges and tunnels. You cannot find a single bridge or tunnel without any cracks.
                                            Cracks happen all the times. When it comes to tunnel, the cracks will cause leak which is really annoying.</I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q2</STRONG>: What kind of mature techniques can be used to fix the cracks of concrete nowadays?
                                            <STRONG>A2</STRONG>:  Grouting method is the one. Using high pressure to pump the Inorganic cement or other kind of adhesive into the cracks and wait for it to become solid so the cracks can be blocked. But it won’t be a onetime thing you might have to do over constantly.</I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q3</STRONG>: We’ve read about Hendrik Jonkers from Technische Universiteit Delft has already invented a type of bio-concrete. Some says our project is so similar to his, What do you think of this.
                                            <STRONG>A3</STRONG>: Actually he is my friend and what you are doing is actually a very different thing. First, Hendrik’s bio-concrete is not self-healing like yours. His bio-concrete needs to be brushed on. Second he didn’t use the technique of microcapsule to protect his bacterium but you do. And actually I think he will be very interested in your project because you use synthetic biology to promote your bacterium in a certain way. I mean who wouldn’t want that？</I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q4</STRONG>：Will there be any new invention of material that will take the place of concrete?
                                            <STRONG>A4</STRONG>: No, I don’t think so. There are more and more outstanding new materials being invented. But none of them can take the place of concrete. Because concrete is common and cheap. And sometimes what we need is the volume. For example, when we are building a dam. We need large amount of concrete to add up to a certain volume. Nothing else is better than concrete in this kind of situation. So I don’t think it can be replaced.</I></LI></UL></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><CENTER><H3 class="mb40" style="margin-bottom: 68px;font-size:20px"> Investigate the longest Bridge in the world</H3></CENTER></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row" style="margin-bottom:50px;width:80%;margin:0 auto"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;">We came to investigate the longest grand bridge - Honkong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and interview the chief engineers there.</P></DIV><DIV class="row" style="width: 80%;margin:0 auto"><P class="lead mb40" style="color:black;"><I>

                            Member of JSCE; RILEM; IALCCE.</I></P><UL style="color: #808080; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 20px; "><LI>The key questions of the interview is presented as following:</LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q1</STRONG>: How tough is it to build the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO Bridge?
                                <STRONG>A1</STRONG>: There is not a specific level to evaluate it. But the difficulty is highly depending on the environment.  The construction environment for HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE is pretty harsh. It is in open seas beyond the coast. The ocean environment and geology is pretty complicated. What’s more, the area is our country’s protection zone for White Dolphin. And the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE is consist of different constructions-bridges, subbottom tunnel, man-made island etc. So I’d say it’s one of the hardest.</I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q2</STRONG>: What is the critical key to prolong the life of the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE?
                                <STRONG>A2</STRONG>:  HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE is mainly consisting of steel reinforced concrete. Steel is something that we are familiar with. There are a lot of previous case proved great uses of steel which can last 200 years. But concrete on the other hand, is a new born material compared to steel. It is less than a hundred years not to mention the years it’s being put into use of great constructions. Thus enhancing the life of concrete is the critical key to prolong the life of the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE. The cracks are the biggest threats to concrete. So what we should do is to prevent and fix the cracks.</I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q3</STRONG>: After the HONGKONG-ZHUHAI-MACAO BRIDGE been put into use what measure will be taken to fix the cracks?
                                <STRONG>A3</STRONG>: Let’s categorize them into three kinds. The first one is slow cracks: they happened slowly and infect long term; second is structural cracks: this kind of cracks happens when there is unexpected struck; Third is the cracks come from expansion and contraction. When they stir the concrete water will react with it and start to heat. So when it cools down, there will be cracks from contraction. If the crack is less than 2mm, we will brush a closing layer on the surface. If it is bigger than 2mm, we will use high pressure to pump the Inorganic cement or other kind of adhesive into the cracks which we call concrete injection. </I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q4</STRONG>：How do you detect the micro cracks?
                                <STRONG>A4</STRONG>: There are many techniques being used around the world nowadays. For example, high definitions photograph.</I></LI><LI><I><STRONG>Q5</STRONG>：What do you think of our project this year?
                                <STRONG>A4</STRONG>: It certainly represent the future, it can be used on many aspects of multiple constructions. I just wish that this doesn’t stop in the lab. I hope it can be put into use as soon as possible.

On September 23th and 24th, 2017, we visited Chendian Village, Chaonan District, Shantou, Guangdong, and conducted surveys, questionnaires, interviews to the local resident. See the <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/a/ae/T--SZU-China--questionnaire.pdf" style="color:black;font-weight:700;font-size:15px"> QUESTIONAIRE </A> here.</P><P class="lead mb40">According to the questionaire, many residents here still keep the traditional layout and ornament. In addition to the living place for a dozen of people, a family will also leave special rooms for ancestor and God worship. Chaoshan people have their own unique understanding about family and clan, which is sometimes expressed in their houses. Generally, they hope the house built by themselves can be passed down from generation to generation, yet they also worry about the house quality. Due to the climate and terrain conditions, the residences built with traditional techniques are easy to have cracks on the walls. According to our investigation, cracks occur on nearly 60 percent of the houses, and even on those built three years ago.</P><P class="lead mb40">When we introduced those new material to them, they were absolutely delighted. Some people think that this project is awesome because it not only makes restoration but also achieves “prevention”, which gives them much sense of security. Others realize that it is a combination of society and nature, which makes them get closer to nature. Some people believe that the application of this new material improves the service life and stability of architecture, yet meanwhile doesn’t affect their artistic value. In this way, Chaoshan people still can decorate their walls and beams with gorgeous paintings and carvings.</P><P class="lead mb40">It can be expected that, in the future, if they apply this new material, the service life of house will be greatly extended to offer shield for the people of a family, and to keep their memories as well. Those delicate decorations will remain for a longer time.</P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="South-China" class="cd-section" style="padding:30px 0;background-color:white;"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3 class="uppercase color-primary mb40 mb-xs-24" style="margin-bottom: 40px;"><CENTER>REGIONAL TEAM CONFERENCE</CENTER></H3><DIV class="row text-center" style="width:55%;margin:0 auto"><DIV><P class="lead mb40 text-center" style="color:black;">To promote better communication in teams, every year, igem teams in China will take part in conferences where we give presentation and get advice from the others.
