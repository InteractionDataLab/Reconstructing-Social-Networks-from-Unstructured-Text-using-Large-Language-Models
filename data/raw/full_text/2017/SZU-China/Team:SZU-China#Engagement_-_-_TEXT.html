Corridor
Our 2017 iGEM project “Corridor” is a distinctive part of iGEM. It belongs to every single person, yet it cannot be limited by anyone. Exchanging ideas, sharing opinions, and coupling individuals. Team information, free community, and frontier knowledges. We intend to let “Corridor” be a real corridor for all iGEMers, so that we engage more actively and effectively in iGEM and synthetic biology.
“How is a 'iGEMer' Platform like?”
Here’s what they told us.
Part-1
This video is about the homepage and some event. iGEMer can log into their corridor account, so they can post their own article or blog in corridor. In homepage, we put some relevant article about synthetic biology in order to letting people know in a way that is meant to be simple.
Part-2
This video is about the community part. The part is now divided into two zones: Asking Zone and Discussing area. You can ask freely in each zone. And of course you can reply and comment on others questions.
Part-3
This video is about moment part. Moment is meant to be remembered. You can record every sadness and happiness everyday here.
Part-4
This video is about Resource and Team information. You can find some stuff and some useful things in track part. We also set a latest scientific result part to inform iGEMers about what happens right now. Team information is a platform where we hppe you can find whoever you want to connect.
