                                We want to know to what extent does the recombinant <I>B. subtilis</I> can heal the concrete. And doing all this experiment (shown previously in <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SZU-China/Results" style="font-size:16px">Results</A> can only support the B. subtilis in speculation. But we don’t know yet. So we take a step forward, establishing a concrete-model to understand the incredible interaction between concrete and the modified B. subtilis.
                                To achieve this, the first question would be about the endospores. We want to create a interactive way, where the endospores can “feel” the microcrack and active itself to repair the concrete.That also means, the endospores would never germinate until microcrack appears. We developed microcapsules embedding method to achieve this. (As shown below)
                            </P><P class="lead" style="color:black;">After some days for the drying of concrete mold. Take out the column-like concrete from the mold. Then spilt the concrete right through the sided itches, exposing the microcapsule. Now if we put the two parts of concrete column together by sticking them with a tape, we can build a micro-crack on the upper surface. So we mark these concrete columns and put them into the artificial seawaters for 28 days.  And you find the micro-crack on the upper surface be repaired like they never ever existed (as shown below)</P></DIV><DIV class="row text-center" style="width:80%;margin:0 auto;text-align:justify;"><P class="lead" style="color:black">Spores (whole yeast medium and 2SG medium) were collected on a solid medium for 7 days.（As shown below)</P><P class="lead" style="color:black">2 ml of Deionized water was added to the solid culture dish and the spores were scraped with an applicator.
