Safety
Safety is of primitive importance in laboratory to ensure smooth functioning and progress of our project. Our team treat safety very seriously and put in effort to make sure that our project design, protocols as well as lab work are up to standards.
Safe Project Design
We make sure that our design follows the safety rules stated by igem registry. Non-pathogenic strains of E. coli (top10 and MG1655), well-understood as level 1 organism, are used in the experiments. Our EL222 blue light sensitive promoter also comes from a level 1 organism Erythrobacter litoralis (strain HTCC2594). We understand that our new part (TlpA promoter and TlpA36 repressor) was originated from a Level 2 organism (Salmonella typhimurium). To minimise the risk, we order the gene sequence from the suppliers and assemble into our plasmid backbone.
Safety Lab Work
Before beginning of lab work, every member in Team NUS has to undergo safety requirements in NUS: Introduction to Laboratory Safety and Health in NUS â€“ Policy, Principles and Practice Chemical safety, Biosafety for BSL-2 Laboratories and Fire Safety training from the Office of Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE, http://www.nus.edu.sg/osh/), the department in charge of Laboratory and Work Safety at the National University of Singapore. To pass the training, we have to answer all the questions at the end and obtain at least 80% accuracy.
Other than that, we have to register and attend Centre for Life Sciences (CeLS) Safety Awareness Briefing. The laboratory is controlled by card access. Only team members or users that have passed all the safety training requirements are given. Our laboratory is also equipped with biological and chemical spill kits, and all members of our iGEM Team are trained to handle Biological and Chemical Spills. Fume hoods and BioSafety Cabinets must be inspected annually according to an international standard.
