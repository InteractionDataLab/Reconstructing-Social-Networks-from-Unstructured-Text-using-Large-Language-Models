Began characterisation for this system, and as expected, results were not promising, as the MG 1655 cells had died too quickly, perhaps due to high leakiness of the system to produce E2 killing protein even in repressed states. As an alternative, we had redesigned the killing plasmid with a tighter TetR system. Construction of this system had begun this week. </P><H2>Third Week</H2><P>Characterisation of new TetR based killing system. However, the transformed MG 1655 cells still die too quickly.</P><H2>Last Week</H2><P>Decided to stop experimenting on the killing system and start focusing on ‘de-bugging’ the temperature sensitive system which performs in opposite fashion to what was expected. </P><P>In response, we had designed the thermal gradient assay by using a conventional thermal cycler to set varying temperature gradient from 30 to 37 degrees across the rows.
