Collaboration
IGEM Stockholm
1. Modelling
NUSgem assisted iGEM Stockholm with the modelling of two of their genetic circuits: Cumate and Tryptophan. Using their timing diagram and genetic circuit, we generated the functional models of these two genetic circuits. In addition to generating the functional models, we also performed sensitivity analysis and provided feedback and possible improvements that could be made to their designs.

Stockholm Modelling Results!
2. Receiving Genome integration plasmids
iGEM Stockholm has worked on integrating E2-IM2 into E.Coli Genome. As part of the collaboration, they kindly shared with us their plasmids which can be used for future genome integration.
The plasmids received by us! Thanks Stockholm!
US AFRL CarrolHS
1. Modelling
NUSgem provided the LabPats iGEM team with modelling support for two of their genetics circuits: LabPats Plasmid 1; LabPats Plasmid 2. In addition to modelling their original circuits with RBS34, we also modelled their genetic circuits using a range of RBSs, RBS29-35. The results are shown below.

2. Mentoring
NUSgem also provided LabPats iGEM with recommendations and ideas for human practice.
A skype session with LabPats!
3. Flat Stanely
NUSgem also participated in the Flat Stanley Collaboration initiative created by LabPats iGEM. The purpose of this initiative is to connect iGEM teams around the world together.
Connected!
IGEM-NTU
1. Characterisation of temperture sensitive system with GFP reporter
Our team had passed our transformed 10β cells containing the temperature sensitive system with GFP reporter ( BBa_K2447014 ) to the NTU team for   characterisation.
2. Double plasmid system containing dCas9 and gRNA/GFP reporter
This year, the NTU team is experimenting with the CRISPRi system, and to aid in the characterisation process of their proposed design of a truncated version of dCas9, our team had supplied them with a double plasmid system containing a GFP reporter.
3. Singapore IGEM meetup with NTU
Meet up between NUSgem and NTU iGEM team. Each team presented their projects and had a fruitful discussion session. To find out more NTU iGEM, click here
iGEM Peshawar
1. Engineered Probiotics Survey
iGEM Peshawar kindly participated in our human practice survey, providing valuable results that we folded into our design. To find out more about iGEM Peshawar, Click Here
iGEM Newcastle & iGEM Toulouse
Discussion
NUSgem participated in meetings with iGEM Newcastle where we exchanged ideas and provided feedback regarding each other’s iGEM projects.

SynBio 7.0 with iGEM York, iGEM Cologne-Dusseldorf, iGEM-NTU, iGEM SVCE Chennai
During Synbio7.0, NUSgem was fortunate enough to attend and meet our iGEM friends from iGEM York, iGEM Cologne- Dusseldorf, iGEM NTU and iGEM SVCE.
We also participated in an iGEM meeting where each team showcased their projects to each other.
