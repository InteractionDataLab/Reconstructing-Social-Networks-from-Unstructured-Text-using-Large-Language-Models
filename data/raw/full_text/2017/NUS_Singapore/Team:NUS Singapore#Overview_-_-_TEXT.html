Overview
We have carried out extensive modelling of various kill switch designs to study and gain insights into the behaviours of the designs. Here, you will find details about how we did it and the interesting results that we obtained!
Methodology
Methodology describes the process we use to develop each of our models. Here you can find information about the modelling principles, our equations and modelling workflow.
Methodology details
Kill switch for probiotics
The kill switch for probiotics is a successful proof of concept that demonstrates how our E2 chassis and modelling workflow make the engineering of customised kill switches for engineered probiotics easier. Using this model, our experimenters successfuly constructed the phosphate-temperature cascaded system with GFP reporter (BBa_K2447015) .  Here you can find the modelling workflow and modelling results that proves our design works!

Kill switch for BeeT
To further demonstrate our workflow is applicable to other kill switch, here we used our modelling workflow to suggest improvement to the kill switch for BeeT, Wageningen iGEM2016's engineered bacteria programmed to kill mites in beehive. We proposed a number of improvements (e.g., increasing specificity and efficiency) to their kill switch using our toolkit and CELLO, and developed a model to study the new design.
