		                    We have wrapped up the 2016 iGEM season with three awards: Best Wiki, Best Presentation, and Best Poster! Our research was based upon making Mars breathable; we managed to finish the latter portion of our research on the chlorite dismutase gene.

		                    Issues arise... We need a new team, as those who were previously on the 2016 UrbanTundra team are now on the UAlberta iGEM team. We are beginning to interview students from across Edmonton.

		                    Friendship! This is our first excursion as a team! We bonded as a group, and this experience has allowed us to recognize some issues with our presentation skills, our organization, and our project itself. We also learned more about one another during a midnight meeting and a Pho outing! Everyone is super excited and cannot wait for everything that is to come!

		                    This month of July is filled with huge progress from two sections of our team: our outreach section with their fundraising and our engineering section with their hydroponics! We came out with a new segment to introduce our team members, called #HumansofUrbanTundra for our social media handles on <A href="https://twitter.com/urbantundrahs" style="color: #000000"> Twitter </A>, <A href="https://www.instagram.com/igem.urbantundra/" style="color: #000000"> Instagram</A>, and <A href="https://www.facebook.com/UrbanTundraEdmonton/?ref=br_rs" style="color: #000000"> Facebook </A>. Our media team's goal has also been established: create a bridge between the public and our team. Meanwhile, the engineering team is busy working on their hydroponics project! They're looking forward to seeing the growth of their test plants.

		                    We were super successful with getting bottles for our bottle drive, with our first one raising over $1000! This could not have been possible without the support of not only our communities, but also the local businesses around the Edmonton area (who are all noted on our sponsor's page)! Thank you all! In addition, we also held our Summer SYNBIO event at the venue graciously donated by the Castle Downs YMCA. The three hour event was definitely a success, with science presentations and cool workshops to boot!

		                    We return with a new presentation, a new set of presenters, and a renewed motivation to do better the second time around! We were very lucky to have been able to compete in another event such as this one, as we were able to gain more insight on our project. We also received a $4000 scholarship towards our Boston trip fees. All of this is just in time for iGEM!

		                    We presented at George P. Nicholson Elementary. It was super fun to present to this group of students, all of whom love science! Thank you for your excitement and intriguing questions. We can't wait to see some of the students become future scientists!
