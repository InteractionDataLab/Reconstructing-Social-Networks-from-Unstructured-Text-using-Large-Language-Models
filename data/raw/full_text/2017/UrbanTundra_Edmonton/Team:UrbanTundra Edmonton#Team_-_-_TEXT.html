Meet Our Team
UrbanTundra_Edmonton is composed of fourteen students from across Edmonton, Canada from three high schools within our city. Our members come from multiple backgrounds, have various interests and possess unique abilities. We are a student-driven team that has collaboratively overcome obstacles with gracious support from our mentors. Each member shares the same interest in science, and in this case, working towards applying synthetic biology to solve real world problems. Together, we face the rigorous journey that iGEM has to offer.
