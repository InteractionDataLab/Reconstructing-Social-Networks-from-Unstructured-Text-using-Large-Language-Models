          Meet Our Team From Estonia!
        </DIV><DIV class="team-description-text col-xs-12 col-md-8 text-width"><P>
            Estonian iGEM team consists of students from the University of Tartu, which is a prestigious public research university and ranks in the top 1.2% of the best universities in the world.
          </P><P>
            Our team is unique, because it is the first Estonian team to participate in iGEM. Also, most of the participants are students of an innovative program Science &amp; Technology. Furthermore, as the program is international, our team consists of people of different geographical origins, which definitely brings multilateralism and diversity to the team! The team consists of young people interested in biology, genetic engineering, programming, infotechnology, as well as marketing and social sciences.

              As a first-year undergraduate student, I found iGEM both very interesting and challenging. I have learnt a whole lot about synthetic biology and I believe that after this experience I ought to stay in this field for many more years to come. I also find it fascinating that less than a year ago, I didn’t even know what a plasmid was and now I am involved in the design and making of new BioBricks.
            </P><P>
              In my free time, I enjoy playing bridge, making 3D origami figures, going to the gym or just simply relaxing with some good music!

              My responsibility is to move the research for our project forward. I work in the laboratory and do everything from research to lab technician duties. 
            </P><P>
              I really like iGEM because of the fact it allows young students who just recently started their academic and scientific endeavours to learn and improve our skills by working in the laboratory and following all the steps to achieving a working synthetically designed bacteria and learning from the mistakes that happened in the process. I hope it opens up a new world of synthetic biology for me.

              My hobbies include the work I do in the laboratory for the iGEM project, gardening, inline skating and reading.
