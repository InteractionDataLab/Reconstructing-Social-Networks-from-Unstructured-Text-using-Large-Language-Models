Project: Yeasthylene
The demand on ethylene has only been increasing during the last decade. It is used as an essential building block in many chemical compounds.The main aim of our project is to find an alternative and biological way of producing ethylene. That is why we have decided to genetically engineer yeast cells to produce ethylene from sucrose.

Lab Diary
In our lab notebook we describe our workflow, failures, troubleshooting and success to give a reader an overview of what have we achieved during intensive and fun work this summer. In the first part of the lab notebook we  focus on our attempt to construct two different yeast strains (spoiler: it didn’t work )=), then describe how have we overcome this issue. In the second part we provide information about our Biobricks construction and in the third part give brief overview of how we have characterised our Biobricks.
1. Stain construction
2. BioBrick construction
3. Subcloning of BioBricks into yeast vectors
4. Characterisation of the Biobricks
