Safe Project Design
The aim of our project is to produce ethylene using two yeast strains. Yeast and bacterial cells are disposed of as bio-hazard according to rules and regulations. As all manipulations are taken in the level 1 bio-safety lab, no extra safety measures are needed.
Safe Lab Work
All students were instructed on how to act in the lab, including:       lab coats and gloves have to be worn all the time during work in the lab; all manipulations with living cells have to take place in the safety cabinet; yeast and bacterial cultures have to be disposed of according to bio-hazardous waste disposal rules. Locations of emergency exit, emergency shower, first aid kit, extinguisher were shown. The use of first aid kit and extinguisher was also demonstrated.
