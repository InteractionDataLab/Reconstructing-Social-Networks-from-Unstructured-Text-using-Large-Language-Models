Parts
This summer we managed to add 8 new parts to the registry, including one new part central to our project (BBa_K2349002). This part was used for the construction of the SUC2 BioBrick with FCY2 promoter and tFba1 terminator obtained from this year's iGEM kit. The bacterial EFE gene (BBa_K1065000) was also obtained from this year's kit and we used it for the construction of two BioBricks along with yeast promoters and terminators. We also synthesized a codon optimized version for yeast of the EFE gene (BBa_K2349003) and constructed a BioBrick with ADH1 promoter and CYC1 terminator.
