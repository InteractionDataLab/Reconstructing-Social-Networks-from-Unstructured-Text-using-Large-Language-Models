Meet Our Team From Estonia!
Estonian iGEM team consists of students from the University of Tartu, which is a prestigious public research university and ranks in the top 1.2% of the best universities in the world.
Our team is unique, because it is the first Estonian team to participate in iGEM. Also, most of the participants are students of an innovative program Science & Technology. Furthermore, as the program is international, our team consists of people of different geographical origins, which definitely brings multilateralism and diversity to the team! The team consists of young people interested in biology, genetic engineering, programming, infotechnology, as well as marketing and social sciences.
Team Members
Luka Bulatovic
Team leader
From: Montenegro
Major: Bioengineering & Robotics
As a first-year undergraduate student, I found iGEM both very interesting and challenging. I have learnt a whole lot about synthetic biology and I believe that after this experience I ought to stay in this field for many more years to come. I also find it fascinating that less than a year ago, I didn’t even know what a plasmid was and now I am involved in the design and making of new BioBricks.
In my free time, I enjoy playing bridge, making 3D origami figures, going to the gym or just simply relaxing with some good music!
Alissa Agerova
Public Relations
From: Estonia
Major: Bioengineering & Robotics
For my main responsibility I have chosen PR, but I am also ready to help the team with human practices and laboratory work.
I believe that it is an amazing opportunity to challenge and perfect your skills in many different spheres like science, including laboratory and IT work, but also teamwork, creativity, marketing and time management.
My hobbies include designing, dancing and figure skating. I love to try out new activities as I would like to be as versatile a person as I can.
Eka Rusadze
Modeling, Research
From: Georgia
Major: Bioengineering & Robotics
I am in charge of modelling and also part of the research team.
I feel that iGEM will be a very valuable part of my experience of working in the lab and being part of a team.
My hobbies include reading, watching TV shows, and downhill skiing.
Dainis Ivanovs
Research
From: Latvia
Major: Bioengineering & Robotics
My responsibility is to move the research for our project forward. I work in the laboratory and do everything from research to lab technician duties. 
I really like iGEM because of the fact it allows young students who just recently started their academic and scientific endeavours to learn and improve our skills by working in the laboratory and following all the steps to achieving a working synthetically designed bacteria and learning from the mistakes that happened in the process. I hope it opens up a new world of synthetic biology for me. 
My hobbies include the work I do in the laboratory for the iGEM project, gardening, inline skating and reading.
Laura Laks
Human Practices
From: Estonia
Major: Gene Technology
I am responsible for human practices and I also help with laboratory work.
I am excited for participating in iGEM. Being able to work on our own project, see how it is going, overcome the hardships and grow in the process are the main reasons why I decided to join.
My hobbies include reading, crocheting, and baking.
Kristel Alman
Research, Public Relations
From: Estonia
Major: Gene Technology
I am dealing with laboratory work as well as with sponsorship, PR, and human practices.
I like the whole concept of iGEM and from the moment I heard about it, I have been thrilled to be a part of it and also our amazing team. It's really a great experience now and teaches a lot about science projects and ethics overall.
My hobbies include sports, music, cooking and volunteering. I try to be as active as I can and participate in various projects.
Daniel Shmidt
Research
From: USA
Major: Bioengineering & Robotics
My responsibilities: laboratory work, IT.
I believe iGEM helps me to look beyond the borders of my knowledge and to get insights into synthetic biology.               Furthermore, it is an opportunity to work with great people.
My hobbies include playing the piano, reading, watching TV series.
