We improved the description of CBD and ChBD on previous part pages.
Proof of the CBD function
The resulted solution after expression is mixed with a gauze piece, and the green color on gauze is                 recorded. Then the gauze is washed three times using ddH2O, but the green fluorescent on it is not                 significantly reduced, proving that the CDB is well functioned. In comparison, no green fluorescent is                 left after washing the gauze mixed with GFP-ChBD (Chintin binding domain).

[Fig. 4. GFP-ChBD on gauze after washing]
Proof of the ChBD function
The resulted solution after expression is mixed with chitin powder. Also, the solution with GFP-ChBD but                 without chitin, solution with the presence of GFP and chitin, and water in comparison, are                 presented.
Tube 3 contains GFP-ChBD, with a significant green color in the solution. After adding chitin powder                 inside the tube, the color in the solution disappears and shows on the chitin powder, as presented in                 tube 2. It proves that the ChBD successfully binds the GFP onto the chitin powder. In contrast, the                 color of the solution is not changed when adding chitin powder into the GFP solution without ChBD. As a                 result, the ChBD is well functioned.
