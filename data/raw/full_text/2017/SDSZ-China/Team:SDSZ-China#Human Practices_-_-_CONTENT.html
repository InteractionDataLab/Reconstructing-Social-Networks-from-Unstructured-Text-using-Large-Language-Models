                        our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts
                        about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the
                        most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on
                        chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively
                        weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA
                        medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged
                        us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This
                        suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Mr. Xing Ruwen</H3><P>Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Company. He is
                        an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs
                        for years.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12"><P>Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.
                        Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about
                        drug production. </P><P>According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two
                        disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor
                        that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it
                        comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it
                        is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and
                        might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the
                        dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-4"><H3>Mr. Li Jinlong</H3><P>Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing
                        department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Company.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12"><P>Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also
                        profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He
                        informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires
                        repeating measures to increase its purification ratio. It is very important for us to consider
                        more about the balance between cost and profits if we want to further develop our method. Now,
                        the exported UDCA drugs are highly demanded and we need to find ways to help simplify the
                        production process and to increase the supply of UDCA-contained drugs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H3>Interview</H3><P>Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can
                        share some of your ideas or understandings about them.</P><P>A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.</P><P>Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?</P><P>A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure
                        various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose
                        infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less
                        side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And
                        using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower
                        cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA
                        instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our
                        marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high
                        vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.</P><P>Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?</P><P>: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA
                        through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their
                        three-dimensional structure only.</P><P>Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the
                        producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?</P><P>A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous
                        factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.
                        Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth
                        the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not
                        too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine. </P><P>Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical
                        ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.</P><P>……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their
                        body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our
                        country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply
                        restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to
                        UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution. </P><P>Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we
                        need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects
                        need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial
                        production.</P><P>Q: Thank you for your suggestions.</P><P>Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?</P><P>A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs
                        to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require
                        three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or
                        substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during
                        the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of
                        production overweights its potential profits.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H2 id="Scientists">Contact with scientists regarding specific technological issues/
                        suggestions</H2></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6"><H3>Prof. Xu Jianhe</H3><P>Prof. Xu Jianhe is a well-respected professor in Biocatalyis and Bioprocessing State Key
                        Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering in East China University of Science and Technology.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-12"><P>With many questions regarding to complex bioprocessing and enzyme catalysis, we write to Prof.
                        Xu, a very famous professor in China and also expert to get further instructions and
                        professional help. At the beginning of our experiment, we decided to employ a two enzyme in one
                        pot catalyzed reaction(see figure.1). However, after our initial attempt, we found out that the
                        reverse reaction was more prevalent than the forward reaction. Thus because of this, the product
                        was actually CDCA, the initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum
                        stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to
                        separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our
                        team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of
                        one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass
                        production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of
                        UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we
                        included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense
                        if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding
                        enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually
                        employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate
                        Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us
                        other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us
                        in refining our experiment and to give it a try.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H1 id="Outreach">Outreach</H1><H2 id="Patients">Contact with Local Hospital and Patients</H2><P>In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to
                        discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to
                        determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in
                        the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term
                        treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing
                        effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.
                        She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in
                        dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing
                        cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications
                        include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant
                        rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves
                        symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.</P><H3>Patients interview</H3><P>Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?</P><P>A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.</P><P>Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?</P><P>A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.
                        And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too
                        expensive!</P><P>Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?</P><P>A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in
                        America.</P><P>Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.</P><P>A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From
                        what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But
                        it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this
                        medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it
                        too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.</P><P>Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically
                        synthesized medicine?</P><P>A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors
                        confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would
                        usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.</P><P>Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors
                        recommended anything else?</P><P>A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically
                        synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by
                        medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.
                        It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I
                        can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative
                        is bear bile powder.</P><P>Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?</P><P>A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people
                        acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say
                        no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.</P><P>Q: Yeah. It is indeed very brutal. Well, thanks for your time Mrs. Zhou. We really appreciate
                        your help.</P><P>A: No problem! Have a good day.</P><P>Q: You too.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H2 id="Centre">Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre</H2></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P>To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal
                        hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the
                        biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with
                        the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,
                        and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear
                        farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After
                        this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we
                        learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese
                        medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine
                        hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to
                        nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an
                        alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-sm-12"><H1 id="Survey">Survey

                    receive theirs.</P><H2>RDFZ-China</H2><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P>We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate
                    4 N4
                    L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB
                    1c3
                    with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the
                    financial
                    support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We
                    are
                    very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project
                    come
                    true.</P></DIV><H2>Shipment Coordination</H2><P>Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently
                    resigned
                    from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who
                    to
                    send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript
                    company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s
                    parts.
                    After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and
                    helped
                    all of them with this shipping problem. </P></DIV><DIV><H1 id="Critiria">Critiria</H1><P><A class="btn btn-warning" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/5/51/SDSZ_china_Integrated.pdf">SDSZ-China
