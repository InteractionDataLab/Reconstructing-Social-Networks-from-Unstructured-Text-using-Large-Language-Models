In order to get a clearer picture of UDCA-contained drug’s manufacturing circumstance in China,                         our team visited Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company to interview the experts                         about current chemical producing methods. According to Mr. Xing Ruwen and Mr. Li Jinlong, the                         most popular method of producing UDCA-contained medicine in the market mainly focuses on                         chemical pharmaceutical procedures. Yet this approach has disadvantages including relatively                         weak efficacy and potential harm to health of the workers. He praises our aim to produce UDCA                         medic in biopharmaceutical procedure and consider it very promising. Furthermore, he encouraged                         us to cut off cost so that our method can be accepted by the market and the patients. This                         suggestion helped us to clarify our future goal.
Mr. Xing Ruwen
Mr. Xing Ruwen is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is                         an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs                         for years.
Mr. Xing introduces us the traditional chemical procedure to manufacture the UDCA-contained drug.                         Also, he leads us to visit the processing workshop and teaches us many valuable knowledge about                         drug production.
According to his opinion, chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drug basically has two                         disadvantages: the first one is its high risk; the second one is related to profit, a factor                         that influences manufacturing the most. For its potential high risk, Mr. Xing conveys that it                         comes from the utilization of metal sodium. Sodium is well-known for its highly-reactiveness; it                         is able react violently with water, which at the same time release large amount of heat and                         might cause potential safety issue to the workers. He praises our thought of avoiding the                         dangerousness and very much acknowledges our method.
Mr. Li Jinlong
Mr. Li Jinlong works as the production manager and he also participating in marketing                         department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company.
Mr. Li patiently answers our questions related to marketing. Analyzing its cost, demand and also                         profit, Mr. Li helps us to determined our minds on trying to solve the problem step by step. He                         informs that currently the successful UDCA synthesis rate is not hight enough and requires                         repeating measures to increase its purification ratio. It is very important for us to consider                         more about the balance between cost and profits if we want to further develop our method. Now,                         the exported UDCA drugs are highly demanded and we need to find ways to help simplify the                         production process and to increase the supply of UDCA-contained drugs.
Interview
Q：We still have some questions regarding to the market. It would be such a pleasure if you can                         share some of your ideas or understandings about them.
A : Please ask, I’m very glad to help you.
Q1: Could you please inform us UDCA medicine’s value in market and its efficacy?
A: UDCA is an cholic acid medicine that has choleretic effect to human bodies. It can cure                         various dan diseases like gallstone as well as hepatopathy including hepatic adipose                         infiltration. UDCA medicine has stronger healing effect than CDCA medicine while having less                         side effects in treatment. However, subtracted from bears, UDCA has a relatively high costs. And                         using UDCA directly converted by CDCA mainly has two benefits: first of all, it requires a lower                         cost because CDCA is subtracted from poultry like chickens, ducks, and geese; also, use CDCA                         instead of UDCA can help protect wild animals (bears.) Also, I consulted experts in our                         marketing department about it and they revealed to me that this approach has very high                         vendibility that medicines manufactured oversea are in short supply.
Q2: What is the basic principle of this drug design/production?
: First we extract CDCA from the bile of chicken, duck and geese. Then we convert CDCA into UDCA                         through two steps of redox reaction. These two substance are isomers than differ in their                         three-dimensional structure only.
Q3: We found out that there are only few factories manufactures UDCA medicine. Is it because the                         producing process’s complexity? Where is the complexity embodied in specific?
A: In fact, the actual process or technology used is not very complex but the key dangerous                         factor is the need of sodium, a dangerous, active metal that burns when it meets with water.                         Moreover, to consider this issue from other perspectives, UDCA medicine’s production copes wth                         the pressure from people’s safety and environment protection concerns. Therefore there are not                         too many factories that manufactures UDCA medicine.
Maybe there are only two factories in China that manufactures this active pharmaceutical                         ingredient (API) officially; one is in Shenzhen and the other is in Suzhou.
……After biliary drainage, it is very likely that bears will suffer from diseases all over their                         body, which is a torture to them. To resolve this problem, researchers and scientists in our                         country wish to convert CDCA in order to receive UDCA. Currently, their methods are deeply                         restrained by the use of sodium due to its danger and difficulty. If you can convert CDCA to                         UDCA successfully using enzymes, you are making a huge contribution.
Also, there are a lot of problems in the production of UDCA in medical industry. For instance, we                         need to consider the safety and profits of this drug. Thus, there are still a lot of aspects                         need to be considered and experiments need to be done when involved in industrial                         production.
Q: Thank you for your suggestions.
Q4: Could you briefly introduce the issue concerning costs and profits?
A: It is complicated because hydrogen needs to be removed. The chemical composition of UDCA needs                         to refine repeatedly, which is tricky. For example, a concentration of 70% of UDCA? require                         three times of refinement at least in order to reach the standard. Also, the raw materials or                         substances need to be recollected and there will be turnovers and other complex factors during                         the process. So the profits is limited. And now the biggest issue is that the danger of                         production overweights its potential profits.

Prof. Xu Jianhe
Prof. Xu Jianhe is a well-respected professor in Biocatalyis and Bioprocessing State Key                         Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering in East China University of Science and Technology.
With many questions regarding to complex bioprocessing and enzyme catalysis, we write to Prof.                         Xu, a very famous professor in China and also expert to get further instructions and                         professional help. At the beginning of our experiment, we decided to employ a two enzyme in one                         pot catalyzed reaction(see figure.1). However, after our initial attempt, we found out that the                         reverse reaction was more prevalent than the forward reaction. Thus because of this, the product                         was actually CDCA, the initial reactant, instead of UDCA, our expected product. This conundrum                         stopped us from reaching any further into the experiment. At this time, Prof. Xu suggested us to                         separate the two enzymes into two steps. (see figure 2) After listening to his suggestion, our                         team worked together and produced our new experiment plan with a two step reaction instead of                         one. In this way, the end product will not be transformed back into CDCA, and the mass                         production of USCA proves to be successful. As well as enhancing the biopharmaceutical effect of                         UDCA, we also aims to reduce the production cost. When we were designing the experiment, we                         included the usage of cofactors: NADH and NADP+. However, the cost of cofactors can be immense                         if they are not regenerated. After hearing about our problem, Prof. Xu suggested us finding                         enzymes to help with the regeneration of cofactors. With his suggestion in mind, we eventually                         employed GDH(Glutamate Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADP+, and LDH(Lactate                         Dehydrogenase) to regenerate the cofactor NADH. Carefully answering our questions and giving us                         other valuable information and cases about our topic, Prof. Xu used his actions to encourage us                         in refining our experiment and to give it a try.
Outreach
Contact with Local Hospital and Patients
In addition, we contact local patients from Xuanwu hospital who suffered from liver cirrhosis to                         discuss the curing effects and prices of various UDCA-contained medicines in the market to                         determine our direction. Through our interviews, we understood that current UDCA medicines in                         the market are unaffordable for patients with average or below average income in long term                         treatment. Also, medicine which price can be accepted by the patients has relatively weak curing                         effect. In order to solve this problem, we consulted experts from doctors from Xuanwu Hospital.                         She reported that UDCA has a large pharmaceutical application. As well as UDCA’s usage in                         dissolving gallstone, its efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing                         cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications                         include its use in the management of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant                         rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves                         symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing hepatocyte necrosis.
Patients interview
Q：Hi, how are you Mrs. Zhou?
A: Good, good. I’m feeling much better now.
Q: If it’s possible, can you briefly explain to us what exactly are you suffering from?
A: Ahh. It’s not a problem. Well, I’ve been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis for several years now.                         And I’ve been constantly taking medicine to treat it. It costs a lot of money. Too                         expensive!
Q: What is this medicine that you are taking now that is this expensive?
A: I don’t really know the exact name, but you can have a look at it. It’s a medicine produced in                         America.
Q: Oh? America? Why aren’t you taking any of the medicine produced locally.
A: That’s a long story to tell. This medicine I’m taking is supposed to be composed of UDCA. From                         what the doctors told me, this medicine is designed to treat diseases like what I have here. But                         it seems like only the America version works on my. The locally produced version of this                         medicine is chemically synthesized so I guess it’s not really a good thing. And I can feel it                         too. Because my stomach often hurts from taking the medicine.
Q: Wait… Are you sure of it? Are you sure that your pain comes from taking the chemically                         synthesized medicine?
A: Well yes. The pain usually starts an hour or half after taking the medicine. And the doctors                         confirmed my theory as well. They say this chemically synthesized version of the medicine would                         usually have gastrointestinal discomfort as a side effect.
Q: Well that’s not good! So have you considered any other choices? Or have the doctors                         recommended anything else?
A: Yes. And that’s actually why I’m telling you how expansive the medicine is. The chemically                         synthesized version of this medicine is not that expensive. Although it cannot be covered by                         medical insurance. It’s definitely affordable. The medicine I’m taking now is indeed very good.                         It doesn’t have any side effects. I guess the only side effects is that it is too expensive. I                         can’t really afford it now. I really want an alternative. But it sees like the only alternative                         is bear bile powder.
Q: What do you know about bear bile powder?
A: I know it’s not extremely expensive so I can probably afford it. But I also know how people                         acquire bear bile powder. Ugh, I don’t want to cause that much pain to the poor bears. They say                         no trading, no killing right? So that’s not really an option for me.
Q: Yeah. It is indeed very brutal. Well, thanks for your time Mrs. Zhou. We really appreciate                         your help.
A: No problem! Have a good day.
Q: You too.
Contact with Chengdu Bear Rescue Centre
To find out more about the bear bile industry and the protective measures against illegal                         hunting, our team, SDSZ-China, went all the way down south to Sichuan province, where the                         biggest Asiatic Black Bear rescue centre is located. There, after exchanging conversations with                         the staff, we found out that Asiatic Black Bear is listed as endangered on the IUCN red list,                         and the most efficient way to rescue bears now is buying bile bears from bear farms. (Since bear                         farming is a legal activity in China, there’s no way to officially put a halt on this). After                         this trip, we went a bit west and visited a real bear farm where bile is siphoned. There, we                         learned the heartbreaking fact that people harvest bear bile only to make traditional Chinese                         medicine. Yet as most of the modern world would possibly agree, traditional Chinese medicine                         hasn’t prove to have a distinct efficacy in treating diseases, rather it serves as a method to                         nourish and build up people’s health conditions. Because of the all the above, the need for an                         alternative way to produce UDCA struck us as extremely urgent.

Collaboration
Intro
Starting this summer, we have formed connections and maintained communications with other high school                     and                     collegiate teams, and we are glad that we could offer our help to some of the teams, and happy to                     receive theirs.
RDFZ-China
We provided lab resources to team RDFZ-China for two times. In the first time, we provided Kit Plate                     4 N4                     L12 and Kit Plate 3 G6 I6 F22 to their team. In the second time we provided bacteria solution of PSB                     1c3                     with designed restriction enzyme cutting site. Since high school teams do not usually have the                     financial                     support from school, most of the lab materials used by RDFZ are purchased by their team members. We                     are                     very happy to share our lab resources and help keep their experiments going and make their project                     come                     true.
Shipment Coordination
Because of the fact that the person responsible for receiving part in Genescript has recently                     resigned                     from his position, so there was a period of confusion where all the teams in China didn’t know who to                     send their parts too. One of our team leader Ruohong Wang actively communicated with the Genescript                     company and after rounds of negotiation finally got to know the new recipient of all the team’s                     parts.                     After knowing this piece of information, Ruohong spread the news the all the teams in China and                     helped                     all of them with this shipping problem.
