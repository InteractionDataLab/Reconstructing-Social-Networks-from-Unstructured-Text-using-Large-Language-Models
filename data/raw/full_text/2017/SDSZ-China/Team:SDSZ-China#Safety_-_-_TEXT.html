Safety
Bacteria we handled
E.coli BL21(DE3) and DH5alpha, both are BSL1 organisms.
Chemicals we handled
We were exposed to mostly nonhazardous chemicals like agarose, LB and SOB agar, and their raw materials                 like NaCl, KCl. We also handle the neurotoxic chemical polyacrylamide to tun the polyacrylamide gel                 electrophoresis, and we did that under a chemical fume hood, with rubber gloves and lab coats on.
Lab environment
There are open bench, clean bench, and a chemical fume hood in our lab. We are well equipped with                         instruments for molecular biology experiments, such as Quantitative Real-time PCR System, Fluorescence                         microscope, Refrigerated Centrifuge, Metal Bath, Air Heating Incubator, etc. And the Lab for                         Microbiology Experiment was totally 40 square meters, with Biohazard Safety Equipment, Horizontal                         Laminar Flow Cabinet and other necessary instruments. It can be used for carrying out microbiology                         experiment with bio-safety level of P2.
Safety protocols in lab
In our high school, the lab guidelines focus on both instructing teachers to properly teach and students                 to protect their own safety. It demands teachers should emphasize the lab safety rules and teach                 students to proceed according to instructions; it clearly states that labs should remain ventilated when                 harmful volatile chemicals are used during experiment, that fire sources in lab and preparation rooms                 should be kept away from combustible materials, and that the injured should be immediately treated.
