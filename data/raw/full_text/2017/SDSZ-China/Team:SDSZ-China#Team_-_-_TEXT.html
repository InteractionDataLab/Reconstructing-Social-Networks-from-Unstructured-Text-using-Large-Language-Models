As a team of high school students, we are sincerely grateful for all the help we’ve received from our PIs, Mr. Zhao Huan and Mrs. Chen Caifeng, who both taught us through the basics of molecular biology, lectured to us about lab safety, and have always been there for us to provide guidance on all problems we encountered.
Our school doesn't have funding for our iGEM team, so we raised money to pay for registration through Crowdfunding, an online platform, and we also received a extremely generous sponsorship from Duewest Education.
We also give our most sincere appreciation to Duewest Education for training our presentation.
As we sought to connect our project with the real world, we attribute our gratitude to the following list of people and organization:
Mr. Xing Ruwen: He is the chief engineer in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He is an experienced manager who has been working on Chemical method of producing UDCA-contained drugs for years. He helped us by informing us the two disadvantages of the chemical synthesis of UDCA, and approving our biological synthetic approach towards producing UDCA. He also helped further acknowledging the advantages of our approach by informing us the danger of chemically producing UDCA
Mr. Li Jinlong: He works as the production manager and he also participates in marketing department’s work in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company. He helped us by accepting our interview on the market condition of UDCA related drugs. He also suggested to test our project in Tianjin Pacific Chemical & Pharmaceutical Company if our project proves to be successful.
Dr. Wei Xinyi: She is a doctor at Xuanwu Hospital. She helped us by patiently answering all the questions we have towards the medical usage of UDCA- related drugs. She also helped us connecting to patients who were suffering from hepatic diseases and have recovered by using UDCA related drugs. Because of the patients, we were able to understand the side effects of chemically synthesized UDCA.
Animals Asia Foundation: The foundation helped us by approving our visit to the Sichuan Bear Rescue Centre. Because of their approval, we were able to interview the staff of Sichuan Bear Rescue Centre to understand the living status quo of Asiatic Black Bear.
Also, we want to give special thanks to everyone that pitched in our crowdfunding, and all teachers in SDSZ international education department and biology faculty for supporting us throughout the year!
