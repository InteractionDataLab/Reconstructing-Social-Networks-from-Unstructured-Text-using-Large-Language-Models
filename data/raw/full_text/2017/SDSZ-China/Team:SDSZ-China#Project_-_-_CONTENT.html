                    (TCM), has been
                    recorded in ancient Chinese medicine book as a significant method to treat hepatic and biliary
                    disorders. UDCA, the effective ingredient of bear bile.Aside from the traditional use of bear bile
                    in Chinese medicine, UDCA(ursodeoxycholic acid), the effective ingredient of bear bile acid, has a
                    much larger pharmaceutical application. As well as the usage of UDCA in dissolving gallstone, its
                    efficacy in primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as an adjunct to
                    medical therapy has been well established. Newer indications include its use in the management of
                    chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, post liver transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease and acute
                    viral hepatitis, where it not only relieves symptoms of cholestasis but also arrests ongoing
                    hepatocyte necrosis. However, the increasing demand for bear bile has caused bears to be in an
                    endangered state: bear poaching and illegal animal trade have greatly dwindled the number of the
                    wild Asiatic black bear. Apart from that, bear bile farming industry in Asia extracts bile through
                    “milking” from the bears, which is operated through surgically implanting a permanent catheter in
                    the animal's gallbladder to obtain the drips. It is unquestionable that the bear bile farming
                    process will lead to both physical and psychological damage in bears. </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><H2 id="Purpose">Purpose</H2><P class="col-sm-6">To find substitute or alternative for bear bile farming, our team will be working on
                    the biological
                    synthesis of the main effective component of this important medicine, UDCA(Ursodeoxycholic Acid).
                    This biological approach will not only be more efficient but also be cheaper than the original
                    chemical approach, which is widely used in the current UDCA synthesis industry. </P></DIV><DIV class="row"><H2 id="Overview">Overview of the project</H2><P>We found that it is possible to convert the main component of poultry bile, CDCA(Chenodeoxycholic
                    Acid), into UDCA, by employing two enzyme-catalyzed the reactions. First, two enzymes was employed
                    to manage the transformation of CDCA to 7oxo-LCA. In the present of 7a-HSD(7alpha-hydroxysteroid
                    dehydrogenase), CDCA is transformed in to 7oxo-LCA by loosing a pair of hydrogen(2H+ and 2e-), the
                    pair of hydrogen is added to NAD+, the cofactor and the acceptor. The NAD+ is transformed into NADH
                    during the reaction. To regenerate the NAD+ and recycle the reaction, to , the LDH(Lactate
                    dehydrogenase) works on pyruvate and take the pair of hydrogen from NADH and transform the pyruvate
                    to lactate and NADH to NAD+.</P><P>In the second step, the 7oxo-LCA is transformed to UDCA by 7β-HSDH(7beta-hydroxysteroid
                    dehydrogenase)and GDH(glutamate dehydrogenase).The 7β-HSDH works on 7oxo-LCA and take a pair of
                    hydrogen from NADPH(the cofactor for the second step)and add it to 7oxo-LCA and form a beta position
                    7-hydroxyl group, which is our target product UDCA. The GDH works on glucose and take a pair of
                    hydrogen from it and add it to the NADP+, to form NADPH to manage the regeneration of cofactor NADPH
                    for the second step.</P></DIV><DIV class="row"><H2 id="Goal">Our goal</H2><P class="col-sm-6">Our mission is to expression of the four enzymes 7α-HSDH (from ecoli DH5a), 7β-HSDH

                    plasmid we construct, we manage to bind our enzyme on gauze. This specific design excels in 3
                    specific ways: first, by controlling the presence of the gauze in the solution, we can control the
                    process of the reaction. Second, when the target enzyme is bound to cellulose we manage to purify
                    the protein we express. Third, the enzyme binding gauze is employed to a machine including the

                experiment is divided into two steps. The first step is to oxidize CDCA into 7oxo-LCA, and the second
                step is to reduce 7oxo-LCA to UDCA.</P><H2>Adding CBD sequence</H2><P>In order to achieve the purification of the enzymes and automatic control of the start and cease of the

                before the reaction, we employed ddH2O to wash over the gauze for 3 times in order to purify the enzymes

                still regenerate the NADPH by taking a pair of hydrogen from glucose until most of the NADP+ transformed
                into NADPH.</P><H2>The implication of the enzyme binding gauze</H2><H3>Description of the purpose of our machine</H3><P>Because of the fact that if the two reactions proceed at the same time, the equilibrium of the reactions
                will shifted towards the reactant, CDCA. Thus because of this, we cannot allow the two reactions to
                proceed at the same time and in the same space. To separate the 2 reaction, we design our reaction
                vessel in the following way: After the first reaction is fully completed, the enzyme slot with gauze
                bond by 7a-HSDH and LDH will be raised up, and in this manner, the first reaction is ceased. After this
                process, we will start the second reaction by dropping the enzyme slot with gauze containing 7β-HSDH and
                GDH.</P><VIDEO width="640" height="480" controls="" autoplay=""><H3>Testification of our own NADH optical detector</H3><P>To testify the function of our NADH optical detector, the change in the concentration of NADH is an
                essential indicator of the course of the reaction, our devices is design to examine the absorbance of
                NADH at 340nm ultraviolet light. By adding NADH in different concentration. We testify the the
                absorbance of ultraviolet ray of NADH under a 3 mL solution.</P><VIDEO width="640" height="480" controls="" autoplay=""><H4>Interpretation of the testification</H4><P>A liner function can be demonstrated base on the date we collect of absorbance of NADH in different
                concentration. Their test values are close to the theoretical value of absorbance. Which means our
                devices manage to detect the absorbance of NADH and its concentration.</P><H3>The relationship between our experiment result and the controlling of our devices</H3><P>Since the change in the concentration of the cofactor NADH is an essential indicator of the course of the
                first step of the reaction, and solutions with different concentration of NADH absorb different
                proportion of the 340nm ultraviolet ray. So in this way we are able to determine the course of the
                reaction just by tracking the change in the solution’s absorbance of 340nm ultraviolet ray. </P><H3>Interpretation</H3><P>We manage to find out that when there is a significant decrease shown on the absorbance of NADH , the
                transformation of CDCA reach its end consider no significant increase of 7oxo-LCA shown in the HPLC
                result. So that we can determine the ceasing point of the reaction.As soon as our devices testify the
                significant decrease of absorbance of NADH, we will raise the first enzyme slot from the reaction
                vessel, and thus in this way end the first reaction. The next step is to drop the second enzyme slot and
                start the second reaction</P></VIDEO></VIDEO></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
