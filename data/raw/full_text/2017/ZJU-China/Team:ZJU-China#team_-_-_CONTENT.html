Now,Participating in igem gives me the chance to experiencing putting science into life, it’s happy and especially this happens with a group of interesting guys.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-7 w3layouts_about_grid_right"><H4>As long as you are young.</H4><H5>Junbo Yang</H5><P>I’m Junbo Yang, a sophomore at ZheJiang University. I have worked in lab since my freshman year, and focus on the molecular and cell biology. However, the involvement in iGem is my first initiative research project. In my spare time, I enjoy long riding on the roads on sunny days and coming up with creative nicknames for others.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-7 w3layouts_about_grid_right"><H4>Appreciate the beauty of life.</H4><H5>Yuxing Chen</H5><P>My name is Yuxing Chen. As a student from ZJU-iGEM Team, I major in clinical medicine. During spare time, my enthusiasm lies in the playing basketball and chess. 
          Of course, being outgoing, I love talking with others about some topics. Since medicine has close relationship with synthetic biology, I cooperate with these interesting guys to get better understanding of knowledge in a new field.
          Anyway, keep calm and go ahead!

From random insertion to basic homologous recombination, I have witnessed the process that we can apply the technology of synthetic biology to the new chassis, Trichoderma. I am interested in the connection between the engineered bacteria with plants according to endophyte. Our wet lab is the place where I spend most of my time. What I love to do is to discuss new ideas with my team partners, and our brainstorm usually gives me a surprise!</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-7 w3layouts_about_grid_right"><H4>Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.</H4><H5>Junming Qian</H5><P style="line-height: 20px !important;">I am Junming Qian, a sophomore majoring in biology. I was passionate about various creatures when I was a little boy. When I entered university, luckily, I had a chance to encounter with Synthetic Biology. Modularizing and standardizing genes, and connecting them to construct an artificial biological systems are really attractive to me, since it calls into fully play one's imagination and creativity. I love the idea of synthetic biology, and that’s the reason why I participate in iGEM. During this time, I am glad to develop a deep friendship with other 13 people in ZJU-CHINA 2017 and learn a lot.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-7 w3layouts_about_grid_right"><H5>Cheng Shen</H5><P>I major in biology and I regard it as interesting.

You can find my self introduction on the website of ZJUChina 2016. This year I serve as the advisor of this team. Through their selection, brainstorm and wet lab work, It feels just like the old times. Sometimes crazy, sometimes disapointed, but stay enthusiastic all the time and the friendship is forever. That's iGEMers. Indeed, I feel very honored to be part of this team and believe they will get the reward they deserve. Good luck to their trip to Boston!
