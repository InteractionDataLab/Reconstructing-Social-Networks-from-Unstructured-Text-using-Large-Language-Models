Welcome to the ZJU-China Parts Pages.This year, we designed 31 parts,and 18 of them had been submitted to the iGEM Registry follow the BioBricks assembly standard as described by RFC10.
We have a brief description of our parts here, but if you would like more detailed information on the parts, we strongly recommend you visit the corresponding parts pages on the iGEM BioBricks Registry.
This year our team can be separated as two groups, the wet-lab group consists of 10 students having the background in biology or medicine and the dry-lab group consists of 4 students majoring in computer science or physics.We had an intense and independent brainstorm and decided the final project at the end of April.After that, we two groups totalized 14 students, always worked together, designing and optimizing our project in different professional views.
Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, logos, results documented on our wiki were performed, composed and collected by ourself.
Lab and Modelling Support
Professor Chulong Zhang and Xiaohong Liu provided us the Trichoderma.atroviride and Agrobacterium strain,so we can use T.atroviride as our new chassis.
Professor Xiaohong Liu gave us a random insertion plasmid as a gift, and we did PCR to get H3 promoters and RP27 terminators from this plasmid.
Professor Chulong Zhang provided us some protocols about filamentous fungi.
Professor Jianxiang Wu and his master students supported us on VOC hardware examination by provided us many tobacco seeds and seedlings.
Doctor Fangliang Huang allowed us to use the large-scale experimental apparatus platform so we can detect the DAPG production using HPLC and running ionic chromatography in analytical tests.
Professor Liqun Zhang from China Agriculture University gave us the pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 strain and then we got the phlABCD cluster through genomic PCR.
Doctor Siwei Li from Tianjin institute of industrial biotechnology kindly gave us four plasmids to support us building T.atroviride genetic engineering kit.
Director Cao from CNTC(China Tobacco) in Hunan province sampled gas from tobacco field to run GC-MS,which proved the different volatile organic components between healthy and P.nicotianae infected tobacco.
Human Practice Support
Professor Ming Chen contacted with CNTC in Hunan Province and leaded us to investigate there in August.
Doctor Fangliang Huang helped us to contact with managers of Zhejiang Science & Technology museum so we had a wide area to develop our HP activities there.
Ming Ding advised and reviewed our Human Practices strategies.
General Support
Special thanks to our instructors Ming Ding for the long hours he spent in the lab to supervise us and insure our safety.
Whenever we needed help, Professor Ming Chen was always there and instructed us in many aspects, we really thanked his strong supports.
We would like to thank every member or user of our products which includes the game, our mini program and official account on WeChat.
Professor Chulong Zhang inspired us to consider the practical application of our project and the follow-up impact to the society.
Supporters
We are grateful for GenScript 1000$ support which reduced our burden a lot in genes and primers synthesis.
