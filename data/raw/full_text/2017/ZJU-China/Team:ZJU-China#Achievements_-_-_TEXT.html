We have designed several new biobricks. See our Parts
We have completed the safety form. See our Safety
We have created a page on our team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.
We participated in the Interlab Measurement Study and met all the Interlab Requirement. See our interlab measurement .
SILVER
Several of our BioBricks work as expected. For example, BBa_K2207997 , BBa_K2207021 , BBa_K2207023 , and they had been submitted as required
We have collaborated with UCAS, HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou, UESTC, NEU-China. All of us have gained a lot. See our collaboration .
We considered the biosafety problem and the ecological effect of our project and consulted same experts and professors for suggestions. See our HP silver
GOLD
We have integrated the investigated issues into our design and execution of our project. See our integrated HP
We have optimized the part BBa_K525998 and submitted several new parts. See our improve parts
We constructed a model to tell the physiological state of tobaccos which has contributed a lot to our project. See our model
We tried to demonstrate that each part of our project work well. See our demonstration
For Prize
We engaged with stakeholders as well as experts, and did field study etc., which as a whole helped us to design and improve our project. More details for Integrated Human Practice
We made a lot of connection with public, especially teenagers, through activities like garden party, open house day, project-related computer game and so on. More details for Public Engagement
We apply mathematical models and computer simulations on our project and help our project more perfect. More details for modeling
