<EM>T.atroviride</EM> is a common biocontrol fungus, usually inhibiting the phytopathogens growth by multiple ways.Therefore,we firstly tested the inhibition function of our strain from two layers.</P><H3 id="experimentaldesign" class="H2Head">Experimental Design</H3><P class="PP">Considering the complicated and disturbed environment condition, we planned to keep asepsis during inoculating the fungi on the plants. Howerver, it was not easy for us to do plant tissue culture in MS medium because of the limited time and instruments. Luckily, UESTC-China connected with us after CCiC(Conference of China iGEMer Community), they used tobacco cells to do transgenesis operation this year.So we had built deep mutual collaboration,they assisted us in cultivating a set of tobacco seedlings in sterilized culture medium.After the seedlings have root and leaf differentiation,inculating <EM>T.atroviride</EM>, <EM>P.nicotianae</EM> and both of these two strains on the root of the seedings.(Here we selected <EM>Phytophthora nicotianae</EM> as our antagonizing phytopathogen for its great damage in tobacco culturing in a very short time.) Culturing these seedlings for a month, taking photos everyday and observing the differences. </P><P class="PP">On the other side,we did confrontational coculture experiments<SUP>[3]</SUP> to see the inhibition ability of <EM>T.atroviride</EM>. <EM>T.artoviride</EM> and <EM>P.nicotianae</EM> were inoculated on the either side of a PDA medium and then incubated on 25°C for two weeks.Hypha growth condition on this medium can reflect the interaction between these two strains,we also model the growth process based on the photos we took during our confrontational coculture.  This model helped us predict the growth of two strains and evaluate the inhibition intensity of T.artoviride.</P><H3 id="results" class="H2Head">Result</H3><P class="PP">The differences between treatment and control groups were very obvious according to our tests in vivo.We selected four points of time of tobacco photos for comparison here.</P><P class="PP capture">Fig.1 Photos for four tobacco groups in four different moments.

On the other hand, we also paid attention to the differences between in vivo tests and confrontational coculture, although <EM>T.atroviride</EM> completely inhibited Phytophthora in PDA medium, however, in plants, T.atroviride only delayed the diseases outbreak, but could not eliminate the harm of Phytophthora, this may showed that the further improvement of <EM>T.atroviride</EM>,like combining with synthetic biology technology, is necessary and meaningful.So the next step was collecting DNA parts which can be used in filamentous fungus and proving that we can express foreign genes in <EM>T.atroviride</EM>.</P><H2 id="gmit" class="H2Head">Gene manipulation in <EM>T.atroviride</EM></H2><H3 id="overview" class="H2Head">Overview</H3><P class="PP">In order to introduce the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> as a new kind of chassis, we accomplished
                the random insertion manipulation in <EM>T.atroviride</EM>. According to the report gene(GFP) under the fluorescence microscope, we can prove that we are able to manipulate the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> at the level of genes and express the genes of interests.  However, to the extented application, especially to enable the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> to realize their biocontrol  function in the automatic agriculture, we need our <EM>T.atroviride</EM> to finish more tasks. For instance, we need to establish more complicated pathway in the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> and to integrate more transcription units to the genome of the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> at the same time. Therefore, we referred to the research in the <EM>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</EM> of the modularized two-step(M2S) chromosome integration technique and established a <EM>T.atroviride</EM> homologous recombination kit<SUP>[1]</SUP>.
            </P><H3 id="experimentaldesign2" class="H2Head">Experimental Design</H3><P id="firstphase" class="PP"><STRONG>The first phase: random insertion</STRONG></P><P class="PP">We obtained the constitutive promoter(H3 promoter), which is workable in <EM>T.atroviride</EM>, as well as the terminator used in <EM>T.atroviride</EM> called RP27. Then we assembled the promoter, terminator, a reporter gene(eGFP) and hph gene (hygromycin) together with the vector PKD1 to construct the random insertion plasmid. PKD1 backbone is a kind of TDNA vector so that it is able to insert into the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> genome.</P><P class="PP">This experiment can prove whether the random insertion can be manipulated in <EM>T.atroviride</EM> and whether it’s convenient to explore various promoters strength for standardization.</P><P class="PP">Through ATMT(Agrobacterium Tumefaciens-mediated Transformation), hph gene and the reporter gene(GFP) can be imported into the genome DNA. The transformants can grow on the medium with hygromycin, and we can see the GFP under the fluorescence microscope.</P><P id="secondphase" class="PP"><STRONG>The second phase: <EM>T.atroviride</EM> homologous recombination kit</STRONG></P><P class="PP">Step1 Characterize the promoters and terminators of <EM>T.atroviride</EM> as the parts</P><P class="PP">To be able to integrate more genes at the same time, we need to get more promoters and terminators using in the construction of module.</P><P class="PP">Firstly, in addition to the existing constitutive H3 promoter, we searched many papers and chose another published constitutive promoter, Phex. Then we replaced PH3 with this Phex in the above random insertion plasmid and transformed this new plasmid into <EM>T.atroviride</EM>, which can be detected under fluorescence microscope.</P><P class="PP">Secondly, as a kind of filamentous fungus, <EM>T.atroviride</EM> inhibit the pathogenic fungus through mycoparasitism by receiving the signals such as agglutinin or others. <EM>T.atroviride</EM> will twine on the pathogenic fungus, persistently upregulate some genes. The ech42 gene is such a kind of upregulated gene during mycoparasitism so that we surmised there is a kind of inducible promoter in front of the ech42 gene<SUP>[2]</SUP>. Therefore, we got a fragment (named it Pech42) in front of the ech42 coding region and replaced the PH3 with it as well. This plasmid also transformed into <EM>T.atroviride</EM> and was detected under fluorescence microscope.</P><P class="PP">Besides, thanks to assistance of the laboratory in our university, we obtained two more kinds of constitutive promoters, PSOD and Ptubulin to establish our kit and characterize them. This two kinds of constitutive promoters are widely used parts among laboratories, they are all used to be applied in the metabolic pathway of <EM>T.atroviride</EM>. Also, another terminator got from the part kits named tADH1 was ready.<SUP>[2]</SUP></P><P class="PP">Step2 Obtain the homologous arms L1 L2 L3 and the homologous arms located in the <EM>T.atroviride</EM> genome.</P><P class="PP">We made the contact with the author of the M2S technique and obtained the homologous arms L1 L2 L3 from him.

Thus, two transcription units were assembled. Then the two transcription units were transformed into <EM>T.atroviride</EM> for assembly and integration with modules of selective markers and integration sites.<SUP>[1]</SUP></P><P class="PP">The process of integrating the several dual-transcription units into the genome of <EM>T.atroviride</EM> bases on the homologous recombination in vivo. The important point of this process is the dedicated overlap regions L1-L3 so that each fragment can assemble with adjacent fragments by the overlap regions. Plus, these overlap sequences were designed to have least homology with the genome of <EM>T.atroviride</EM> by sequence analysis.</P><H3 id="results2" class="H3Head">Result</H3><P class="PP">The first phase：random insertion</P><P class="PP">According to the GFP observed under the fluorescence microscope(P2), we can prove that PKD1 plasmid contains both H3 promoter and Hex promoter can work.
