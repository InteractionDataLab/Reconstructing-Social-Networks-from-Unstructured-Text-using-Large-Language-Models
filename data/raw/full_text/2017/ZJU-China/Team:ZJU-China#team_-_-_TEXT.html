Qianjing Jiang
Once ever, chasing purest things was my purpose, pure freedom, pure science, pure nature… it’s all about purest life. Now,Participating in igem gives me the chance to experiencing putting science into life, it’s happy and especially this happens with a group of interesting guys.
As long as you are young.
Junbo Yang
I’m Junbo Yang, a sophomore at ZheJiang University. I have worked in lab since my freshman year, and focus on the molecular and cell biology. However, the involvement in iGem is my first initiative research project. In my spare time, I enjoy long riding on the roads on sunny days and coming up with creative nicknames for others.
Appreciate the beauty of life.
Yuxing Chen
My name is Yuxing Chen. As a student from ZJU-iGEM Team, I major in clinical medicine. During spare time, my enthusiasm lies in the playing basketball and chess.            Of course, being outgoing, I love talking with others about some topics. Since medicine has close relationship with synthetic biology, I cooperate with these interesting guys to get better understanding of knowledge in a new field.           Anyway, keep calm and go ahead!
Zicong Wang
I am Zicong Wang, a sophomore major in chemistry. I love photography and reading, as well as baking cakes and desserts. I have done a month of research at the Institute of Micro analysis.I am mainly responsible for making the device in the team and I  proposed the idea to check whether the plants are ill by detecting their VOCs.
No pains, no gains
Zifan Xie
Hello everyone, I am Xie Zifan, a third-year student majoring in Applied Biology. I took part in experiments of the Remote-control of Trichoderma.  How lucky I am to have the chance to take part in the game and have such an awesome experience. I’m glad to meet these gays, who love biology deeply and have wonderful ideals, and learn a lot on them.
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.
Yihe Zhang
I am a second year applied biology student whose duty in our project is to domesticate the Trichoderma. From random insertion to basic homologous recombination, I have witnessed the process that we can apply the technology of synthetic biology to the new chassis, Trichoderma. I am interested in the connection between the engineered bacteria with plants according to endophyte. Our wet lab is the place where I spend most of my time. What I love to do is to discuss new ideas with my team partners, and our brainstorm usually gives me a surprise!
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.
Junming Qian
I am Junming Qian, a sophomore majoring in biology. I was passionate about various creatures when I was a little boy. When I entered university, luckily, I had a chance to encounter with Synthetic Biology. Modularizing and standardizing genes, and connecting them to construct an artificial biological systems are really attractive to me, since it calls into fully play one's imagination and creativity. I love the idea of synthetic biology, and that’s the reason why I participate in iGEM. During this time, I am glad to develop a deep friendship with other 13 people in ZJU-CHINA 2017 and learn a lot.
Cheng Shen
I major in biology and I regard it as interesting. On thinking that all the animals, large and small, including ourselves,obey the same rules of nature no matter how they look like, I will really appreciate it that the mother nature forms such a colorful world.
Shisheng Li
I'm a second year biology student and it's also my second year participating iGEM. I enjoy playing table tennis in my spare time. Being a part of ZJU-China and working with our team members in this summer can be the best experience for me.
Zhanyu Wang
This is my second year as an iGEMer. You can find my self introduction on the website of ZJUChina 2016. This year I serve as the advisor of this team. Through their selection, brainstorm and wet lab work, It feels just like the old times. Sometimes crazy, sometimes disapointed, but stay enthusiastic all the time and the friendship is forever. That's iGEMers. Indeed, I feel very honored to be part of this team and believe they will get the reward they deserve. Good luck to their trip to Boston!
Sida Li
I’m a junior student majoring in bioscience. Interested in photographing, birding and frisbee. Hoping to make the invisible microbial world more fascinating through synthetic biology.
The absence of desire leaves one free to purse other things
Hao Fang
I am a second year bachelor student and major in computer science. What fascinates me is solving problem using information technology and IGEM is such an awesome competition. In the project, I'm responsible for device design, data analysis and other programming work. Surely the IGEM experience will be the unforgettable one in my college life.
Where there is a will, there is a way
Tianze Wang
Hello! I’m Wang Tianze, a sophomore major in physics. Having a strong interest in interdisciplinary and biology, I enjoy exploring new fields and brainstorming with others. Learning the laws behind things and life both attract me. In the daily life, I’m an optimistic and easy-going girl. I love listening to others attentively to get what they think, what they have experienced. I’ve learned a lot during this project, and it will be an unforgettable memory.
Life is just a series of trying to make up your mind.
Ruofei Zhang
My name is Ruofei Zhang, a junior student that major in Digital Media Technology. The reason why I join the IGEM competition is that I want to exit myself from the safe area and look for more magnificent scenery. I am mainly responsible for art work in our team and I also try something I never heard before. It's nice to meet our fun and powerful companions.
Seeking Truth and Pursuing Innovation:)
Zhiling Zhou
My name is Zhiling Zhou, a sophomore in Zhejiang University. My major is computer science and technology.           The reason for which I chose this major is that, having long been amazed by the rapid development of artificial intelligence and data analysis, I’m wondering, to which degree can computer change human’s future. I feel it a great privilege to be a member of ZJU-CHINA, to work and do research with you guys!
