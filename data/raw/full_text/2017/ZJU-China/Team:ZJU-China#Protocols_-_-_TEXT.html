Plasmid Cloning
PCR was widly used to make a copy of a piece of DNA and at the same time add restriction sites to the ends of that piece of DNA so that it can be easily cloned into a plasmid of interest.
Designing primers for PCR based cloning. Before running PCR, we needed to design appropriate primers based on the method that we chose to clone a piece of DNA into a plasmid. For example, in our experiment,  we used EcoRI and XabI to ligate our target gene into the recipient plasmid. Therefore, PCR primers for molecular cloning consisted of not hybridization sequence, but EcoRI and XabI restriction site.
Run PCR and test. In order to amplify insert DNA, we used a high fidelity polymerase to minimize mutations. After that, running Agarose Gel Electrophoresis to check whether the DNA size was correct.
Isolate the insert and vector by gel purification or PCR purified.
Ligate the insert into vector. Insert and vector backbone DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. In fact, we had try many other ways to ligate the insert into vector, for example, In-Fusion Cloning.
Transformation
Transformed with 5-10μl ligation reaction into competent cells using the general heat shock.
Screening positive clones
If there were a high number of colonies on plate, colony PCR was used and only the positive clones were mini-prepped.  On the contrary, we picked single colonies for mini-prepping.
After purifying the DNA, we conducted a diagnostic restriction digest or PCR  and products analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm if correct construct was present.
Verify Plasmid by Sequencing
Positive clones were sent for sequencing of the insert using appropriate primers.

Western-blot and check flag-tag
Sample preparation for protein gel.
Yeast total protein extraction. Load 15-20 ul of supematant per lane on a protein gel. Load 10 ul of prestained protein ladder. Run protein gel at 200V until dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.
Western Blot：
Run gel as usual. Take gel out of electrophoresis apparatus. Cut into segments as required; Part of gel can be stained directly in Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Part to be used for electroblotting is put into tap water on shaker, after first having marked it unambiguously to identify top/bottom, left and right etc.
Leave in water on shaker for 5 minutes. This step can be substituted by washing the gel in electro-transfer buffer (see below) for 5 minutes.
We use a semidry blotter, which we have found to be quicker, more economical and easier than fully submerged blotting methods. We cut Whatman 3M filter papers to the size of our gels, and place three of these onto the semi dry blotter. These are then wet with transfer buffer (we routinely use 3.03 g Tris base, 14.4 g Glycine, 10% Methanol per liter). The gel is put onto the filters and a prewetted nitrocellulose filter is put ontop of the gel. Alternately put a PVDF membrane on top; if you are using PVDF remember it is essential to prewet the PVDF in 100% methanol. Great care should be taken to ensure that no air bubbles are anywhere in this stack of membranes. Then three more wetted Whatman 3M filters should be placed ontop of the pile, again taking great care not to have any bubbles in pile. Put the top onto the apparatus and screw it down. Proteins in transfer buffer are negative in charge mostly due to residual SDS and they therefore move from -ve to +ve pole. So the +ve electrode is above the nitrocellulose and the -ve side is below the gel.
Run for 30 minutes to 1 hour at ~100mA. The most reliable way of doing this is to use a powerful power supply 200-500mA and put it on constant voltage, with a setting of 5 to 10 Volts. Low molecular weight proteins (20kDa or less) will transer in 30 minutes at 5 Volts, while higher molecular weight (150kDa or more) transfer in 60 minutes at 10 Volts.
After running disassemble the apparatus and remove nitrocellulose filter. Stain this for 5 minutes on shaker in Ponceau reagent. Destain with regular SDS-PAGE gel destain solution.
After Ponceau staining put the nitrocellulose filter into blocking solution, such as 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 1% Carnation non fat milk (NFM), for 20 minutes to 1 hr at RT or 37°C. Since the NFM works just as well as BSA but is much cheaper, there is really no good reason to use BSA. Ponceau staining will fade to become completely invisible. Carry on with antibody incubations etc.
Antibody Incubations
Put in antibody solutions. Volume should be enough to cover blot and allow it to float freely when you agitate. In initial experiments, antibody concentration should generally be about 1:100 - 1:1,000 for ascites, CL350 tissue culture supernatant or antiserum, undiluted to 1:10 for monoclonal supernatant, and about 1-10µg/ml for a pure IgG. If dilution brings antibody concentration to less than 50 µgs/ml, add some BSA or NFM to act as carrier protein. Incubate for at least 1 hour with shaking (can be room temperature or at 37°C, can also do overnight at 4°C).
Wash membranes in TBS (10mM Tris, 154mM NaCl, pH=7.5 plus 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 times at least five minutes each time with extensive agitation.
Incubate in second antibody (peroxidase-conjugate, phosphatase conjugate or radioactive). Add BSA or NFM carrier as before if necessary. Incubate for at least one hour at room temperature or 37°C can also do overnight at 4°C with shaking as before.
Wash membranes in TBS for 3 times at least five minutes each time with extensive agitation.
Alkaline Phosphatase Blot System
Incubate in alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody against the primary antibody. Typical concentration is 1:1,000 in TBS. Add a small amount of BSA or NFM to act as carrier. Incubate for 1 hour at room temperature (or 37°C) with shaking.
Wash in TBS three times 5 minutes each.
Put into developer. Buffer is 100mM Tris/HCl, 100mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2 pH=9.5. To 10ml of this add 33µl BCIP-T and 33µl of NBT. Can store these solutions at -20°C. Can buy this solution made up already from Sigma. Reaction product is purple, and appears in a few minutes; can incubate for up to an hour if the signal is weak. Watch development of reaction and stop with water. Some of background disappears on drying.
Horse Radish Peroxidase Staining
After washing of blots in TBS or PBS add reaction mixture. This is; 20 mls 0.1M Tris/HCl pH=7.2. 200 µl NiCl (80 mg/ml), 6 µl 30% hydrogen peroxide, 1ml of 5mgs/ml diaminobenzidine. Alternate protocol; Make 20 mls ammonium acetate buffer (50mM, pH=5.0). Add 1 ml of 10mg/ml Diaminobenzidine, 40µl 30% hydrogen peroxide. Brown reaction product is seen in 1-10 minutes, not quite so nice as above method.
Chemiluminescence Staining
Chemiluminescence has an advantage of perhaps an order of magnitude greater sensitivity than the dye based methods above. In addition, several films may be exposed from a single blot, giving an advantage in interpretation of weak and strong signals on the same membrane. However it requires a darkroom to perform and is more expensive in reagents. Reagents are generally bought in a kit, and we recommend simply following the kit instructions.
