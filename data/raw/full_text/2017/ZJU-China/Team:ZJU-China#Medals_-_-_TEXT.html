we have registered our team Team List
We have set up a team wiki
We have completed the judging form
We have prepared a poster and a presentation, which we will be presenting at the Jamboree.
We have designed several new biobricks See Parts...
we have completed the safety form
we have created a page on our team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of our project
we participated in the Interlab Measurement Study and met all the Interlab Requirement. You can see the result here See InterLab...

Several of our BioBricks work as expected. For example, Bbaxxxxxx， and they had been submitted as required.
We have mentored a high school team (HFLS_H2Z_Hangzhou)and we designed a special linker for their core proteins and constructed the plasmid for them. We also helped them standardized this part.
We visited China National Tobacco Corporation(CNTC) to investigate the damage caused by tobacco black shank which inspired us to come up with the idea of Trichoderma，the guardian. And the staff of CNTC gaved us lots of helpful suggestions.
We invited Prof.Chulong Zhang as our instructor, who has focused on Trichoderma for tens of years. He recommended Trichoderma atroviride for us as the chasis which is safe and environment-friendly. We also consulted him how to prevent our engineered Trichoderma from horizontal gene transfer.

We engaged with stakeholders as well as experts,and did field study etc., which as a whole helped us to design and modify our project.
We have induced several site-mutation in the sequence of T7 promoter and in this way，we created a series of promoters with different strength. We believe that these promoters will provide the researcher with more freedom to select the promoter with a proper strength. It can be a great improvement for T7 promoter.
Through logistic regression analysis of the VOC released from healthy or infected tobacco，we constructed a model to tell the physiological state of tobaccos according to the VOC they released. It also helped us to select the four practical VOC sensors from 18 of candidates.
Our engineered trichoderma has shown its  magicl power in fighting with Phytophthora parasitica var．nicotianae and in boosting the growth of nicotiana.
