Those can be zwittermicin A, chitinase, serine protease and anything you need to protect your lovely plants. zwittermicin A is an antibiotic which can inhibit the growth of <EM>P. nicotianae</EM>. Chitinase is a lytic enzyme that breaks down fungal cell walls. Serine protases plays an important role in hydrolyzing the eggshell of root-knot nematodes. With these fungal growth inhibitors our engineered <EM>T.atroviride</EM> will be able to protect our plants better.</P><P class="capture">Fig.1 Genetic circuit of the downstream</P><H3 id="za" class="H3Head">Zwittermicin A</H3><P class="PP">Zwittermicin A is an antibiotic that has the potential to suppress plant disease due to its broad spectrum activity against certain gram positive and gram negative prokaryotic micro-organisms. Since <EM>T.atroviride</EM> does not produce zwittermicin A by itself, a gene cluster obtained from  Bacillus cereus UW85 was introduced into <EM>T.atroviride</EM>. The genes responsible for the production of zwittermicin A are located on a 16 kb cluster containing nine orfs, from orf1 to orf9, and a self resistant gene zmaR, a gene that encodes an acylation enzyme that deactivate zwittermicin A.<SUP>[1]</SUP></P><P class="capture">Fig.2A Gene organization of the Zwittermicin A biosynthetic cluster<SUP>[2]</SUP>.</P><P class="capture">Fig.2B Units used in Zwittermicin A Production.<SUP>[2]</SUP></P><H3 id="sp" class="H3Head">Serine protease</H3><P class="PP">Root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), which are one of the most destructive nematodes, cause the loss of crop about 10%, serious as high as 75%<SUP>[3]</SUP>. In the present, the egg-parasitic fungus P.lilacinum is the main biocontrol material of root-knot nematodes.P.lilacinum secretes protease and chitinase to hydrolyze the nematode eggshell, so that the root knot nematodes cannot grow normally<SUP>[4]</SUP>. However, because P.lilacinum can live in the cornea, the usage of P.lilacinum is still dangerous. Therefore, in this part, the purpose of our project is to give our harmless <EM>T.atroviride</EM> the ability to kill the root-knot nematodes by overexpressing serine protease which plays an important role in hydrolyzing the eggshell of root-knot nematodes.</P><H3 id="ch" class="H3Head">Chitinase</H3><P class="PP">Chitinase is a hydrolytic enzyme that breaks down hydrolytic bonds in chitin.  As chitin is a component of the cell walls of fungi and exoskeletal elements of some animals (including worms and arthropods), chitinase has been shown to be useful in biological control against fungi<SUP>[5]</SUP>. Therefore, in order to inhibit fungl growth, our <EM>T.atroviride</EM> can produce chitinase when the plants are infested by fungi and the signal conversion systems work well.</P><H3 id="anythingelse" class="H3Head">Anything else</H3><P class="PP">Your lovely plants will face many challenges in the complex and dangerous soil condition, so that, the little plants must be protected by the strong <EM>T.atroviride</EM>.

We did two sets of experiments: one added PMSF, which was a inhibitor of serine protease, and the other did not. And then, reading the OD253 of these two solutions.(You can know more details about the detection from the protocol) Obviously, the OD253 of the former one is higher than the later one and the values of OD253 increased with time in a period of time ; therefore, we made the conclusion that the yeast produced the serine protase successfully and effectively.</P><P class="capture">Fig.4 The values of OD253 increased with time</P><P class="capture">Fig.5 The values of OD253 increased with time and this solution did not add the PMSF. </P><P class="capture">These were the OD253 of the solutions after a period of reaction.The red one was the solution that did not add the PMSF; the blue one was the solution that added.
