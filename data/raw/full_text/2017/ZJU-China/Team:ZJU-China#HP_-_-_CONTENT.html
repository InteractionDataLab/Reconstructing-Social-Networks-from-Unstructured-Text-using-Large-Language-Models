Since synthetic biology, also been called engineering biology, is based on engineering thinking and methods, it values the reliability and repeatability of measurements. The InterLab study, involving teams and labs around the world，takes green fluorescent protein (gfp) as an example after one strict, detailed protocol to ensure the common, comparable units for measuring, which hopes to test the robustness by comparing the results from different labs.</P><P class="PP">This is the Fourth Measurement InterLab and our team participates in it. The InterLab this year tries to establish a GFP measurement protocol based on engineering principles, find out the similarity between fluorescence measured around the world and make gene expression more precise and reliable through tests of some RBS devices (BCDs). We are provided with materials for standard curves together with positive control, negative control and devices with different promoters and RBSs. Strictly following the requirements and protocol, we have obtained the relevant datas.</P><H1 id="method" class="page-header ArticleHead GreenAH">METHODS &amp; MATERIALS</H1><H2 id="transformation" class="H2Head">Transformation</H2><P class="PP">Transform Escherichia coli DH5α with these following plasmids:</P><P class="PP"><UL class="Retract"><LI>Positive control</LI><LI>Negative control</LI><LI>Test Device 1: J23101+I13504</LI><LI>Test Device 2: J23106+I13504</LI><LI>Test Device 3: J23117+I13504</LI><LI>Test Device 4: J23101.BCD2.E0040.B0015</LI><LI>Test Device 5: J23106.BCD2.E0040.B0015</LI><LI>Test Device 6: J23117.BCD2.E0040.B0015</LI></UL></P><P class="PP">Resuspend DNA in selected wells in the Distribution Kit with 10µL ddH20.

Abs600 of the samples reflected its concentration, which could show the growth of bacteria. As the picture shown, the growth rate of bacteria generally got slower as time went by, this is probably because at the beginning of the measurement, bacteria was in the later period of logarithmic phase and the resources were not that sufficient, inhibiting the growth. Several samples appeared to be different, such as colony 1 of device 4, which seemed to be in the logarithmic phase and colony 2 of device 1, whose concentration went down after 2 hours of incubation, perhaps low activity resulting in massive death.</P><P class="PP">In addition, growth curves of each colony were different. This may be caused by different initial concentration of samples after dilution, which led the samples be in different growing statuses. We will mention it later.</P><P class="PP">The fluorescence differed obviously. The absolute fluorescence and relative fluorescence of device 3, device 5 and device 6 were relatively low, for which their promoters and RBSs might account. For two replicates of device 1, their fluorescence differed greatly and the same as growth, making it hard to compare. Either operational error or colony selection would affect.</P><P class="PP">Furthermore, the tendence of absolute fluorescence turned out to rise and fall, mostly going down as time went by. We thought this was because the protein expression varied in different growth phase and growth of bacteria changed over time.</P><H2 id="reflection" class="H2Head">Reflection</H2><P class="PP">Some of our operations might affect the results, which can be improved.</P><P class="PP">Our lab do not have plate reader, so we borrowed one from other lab. We cultured bacteria and loaded samples in our lab and then took them to the other lab for measurement. Since it took some time to go back and forth, our actual measurement took longer than expectation, so the measurement postponed a little. Though samples were laid on ice, the bacteria could still growth, making the real measurement time different from the demand. Similarly, the cultures settled in the process, leading to the deviation of the concentration after dilution. As a result, the comparability between each sample was affected.</P><P class="PP">By the way, the first time we did the OD600 Reference Point measurement, we put the 96 well plate containing LUDOX on ice. Then it turned out that the OD600 of LUDOX was lower than water. Maybe LUDOX denatured in the cold environment on ice referred to the official warning. So perhaps it is better not to put LUDOX on ice or anywhere like that.</P><H1 id="feedback" class="page-header ArticleHead GreenAH">Feedback</H1><P class="PP">After the InterLab Study measurement, we have something to say about the provided protocol, which goes on like this:</P><H1 id="advantages" class="page-header ArticleHead YellowAH">Advantages</H1><UL id="improvements" class="Retract contentLi"><LI>The protocol is not only detailed but also clear, so it is easy to operate and avoid differences between teams.</LI><LI>The provided Excel sheets make it easier to calculate.</LI><LI>There are extra materials for mistakes and failure.</LI><LI>Some warnings are necessary, such as LUDOX cannot be stored in refrigerator and oversaturated detector will cause low concentrations linear, but high concentrations saturate or fall for Fluorescein standard curve. It helps a lot in finding solutions to problems.</LI></UL><H1 class="page-header ArticleHead YellowAH">Improvements</H1><UL class="Retract contentLi"><LI>The PDF version of protocol differs from the Excel sheets in some ways, such as the volume of diluted culture.
