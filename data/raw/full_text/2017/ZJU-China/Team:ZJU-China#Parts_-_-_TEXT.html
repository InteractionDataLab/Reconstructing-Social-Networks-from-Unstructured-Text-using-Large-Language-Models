Parts
Welcome to the ZJU-China Parts Pages.This year, we designed 31 parts,and 18 of them had been submitted to the iGEM Registry follow the BioBricks assembly standard as described by RFC10.
We have a brief description of our parts here, but if you would like more detailed information on the parts, we strongly recommend you visit the corresponding parts pages on the iGEM BioBricks Registry.

Favorite Parts!
Our new Basic Parts in Trichoderma spp.
BBa_K2207003 ~ BBa_K2207008
We have collected and proved many new parts which can be used in Trichoderma spp. , including four promoters, two terminators and the selection marker hygB gene. And then we cloned them with homologous sequences on pSB1C3,for any researches who want to express genes in Trichoderma spp, they only need to integrate  these parts with GOI and clone them into corresponding vectors(no matter what kinds of transduction methods or plasmids he used.) Click here to see how we constructed these systems.
Our calcium ion response  promoter.
BBa_K2207021
We replaced the upstream activating sequence (UAS) of CYC1 promoter with 4 CDREs. This promoter responds to the cell calcium concentration increased, only designed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and depended on S.cerevisiae's endogenous calcineurin and calmodulin. Click here to see how we use this part.

BBa_K2207013
We got a new gene cluster through PCR from Pseudomonadaceae.fluorescens genome,phlABCD,coding four enzymes used to synthesis 2,4-DAPG.We have mutated some illegal enzyme sites and successfully detected the DAPG production. Click here to see our fantastic work.
Improve T7 promoters
BBa_K2207024 ~ BBa_K2207030
T7 promoter is widely used in genetic engineering for its highly yields of recombinant proteins when T7 RNAP is present. This year,we did Site-directed mutagenesis to get some mutants based on T7 promoters.We used mRFP as a reporter gene to measure these mutants strength. Click here to see more details.
