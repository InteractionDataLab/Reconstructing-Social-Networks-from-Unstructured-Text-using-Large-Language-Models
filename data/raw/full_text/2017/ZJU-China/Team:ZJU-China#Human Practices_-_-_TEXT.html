MAY, 23
When your team is on the stage of brainstorming, are you bothered with looking for the former iGEM teams' information? Take out your smart phone and try our Mini Program.
MAY, 28
"We just built up a iGEM high school team, how shall we start?"
"Don't worry! We can share our experience with you."
JULY, 4
After determining our logo, we designed some derivative products such as postcard, key chain, badge, notebook, stickers, etc. We sincerely hope that these gifts can get everyone's favor during intercollegiate communication.
JULY, 9
We held a "garden party" in the Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum. The children who joined in it said: "I've learned lots of scientific knowledge in this activity." "I found it interesting. Give the thumbs up."
JULY, 13
"I do believe that such cutting edge technology can do great benefits to people once it grows fully mature. But we have to make sure it's safe before we take a closer look at its effectiveness," one of the officials said.
JULY, 19
National Demonstration Center for Experimental Biology Education in ZJU
"Wow, What is this? How shall I use it?"
"Welcome to our lab, let me guide you!"
JULY, 20
Can Trichoderma defend your plant from dangerous? It depends on you. Play our computer game and see who's the winner.
AUGUST, 23
By visiting the tobacco field as well as communicating with the officials in the tobacco company, we got useful suggestions and inspirations. Then we designed our device and modified our "wetlab" work.
AUGUST, 25
We had a freewheeling talk with the iGEM team of Northeastern University, because of this talk,  we later had opportunities to collaborate with them in experiments.
AUGHST, 26
Many suggestions that we received from other teams are of value, so we further improved our design after coming back. Besides, we built close cooperation with UESTC-China since we both used the tobacco.
OCTOBER, 7
We trained ourselves through telling others our story, and they fed back what they were interested in or what they could not figure out, and all these information helped us discover many defects in our presentation.
Human Practice Summary
We engaged with stakeholders as well as experts,and did field study etc., which as a whole helped us to design and improve our project.
We consider the safety problem and interviewed the officials about bio-safety legislation. New designs and changes occurred after we made a trip to the tobacco company. Also, we made a lot of connection with public, especially teenagers, through activities like garden party, open house day, project-related computer game and so on. What's more, we joined in some meetings with other participants.
We saw the current condition and problem, and made dialogues with professors and common people to got useful advice. Then, we made new things(like our VOC device) and confirmed one direction of our project. Through the project process, human practice helped us throw light on public issues and make efforts to solve the practical problem.
