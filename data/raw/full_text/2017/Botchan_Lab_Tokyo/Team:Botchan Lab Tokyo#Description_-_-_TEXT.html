PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We Botchan Lab. Tokyo are going to create Escherichia coli which can do    nitrogen fixation. We came up this idea from one interesting episode of    Papuan people. They live in New Guinea and their main food is tubers,    especially taro. Despite their low-protein meals, they are very muscle    and healthy. How they get protein was one of the most mysterious things    about them for a long time. Then, Japanese scientist Tomotari Mitsuka    investigated their excrements in order to research their intestinal bacteria    and he found that Papuan people have much more two nitrogen fixation    bacteria, Klebsiella and Enterobacter, in their intestinal flora than    other people in the world. Then he shows one hypothesis. Papuan people may    take in nitrogen gas from the air and convert it into proteins by using    nitrogen fixation bacteria in their intestinal flora and get proteins from    them. As we see this episode, we thought that “If everyone in the world    as well as Papuan people can do nitrogen fixation at their guts, that means    we can eat air! That’s interesting!” So, we decided to create Papuan model,    which make our dream, “eating air”, comes true.Here we introduce our Papuan    model. We put nifBHDKENhesAnifV genes and Glutamic acids dehydrase gene and    Phenylalanine dehydrase gene into E.coli. We want to confirm if E.coli take    in nitrogen gas from the air, convert it into ammonia, and then convert it    into amino two amino acids, Glutamic acids and Phenylalanine. We are going to     check this by using gas chromatography and auto radiography.    Our future vision of Papuan model is put it into our intestinal flora and    become like Papuan people who can create amino acids from air. We hope that    this Papuan model will solve the problem of protein-energy malnutrition by    adding the ability of creating proteins just breathing, boost patients’    immunity, and lower the mortality in developing countries.
