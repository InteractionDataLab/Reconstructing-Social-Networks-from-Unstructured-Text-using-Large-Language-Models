But the data in each lab, in each country or area are different sometimes since the protocols are different in each lab. These differences can sometimes affect the results because it will be difficult to compare the results done by different protocols even the aims of the experiments are the same. In this meaning, making a standard way of measurements is a big challenge but a very important thing for synthetic biology field. Interlab Study is aiming to improve the measurement tools based on the data collected from all over the world. This time, by using the standard protocol and the test devices provided from iGEM, teams conduct GFP fluorescence experiments to see and compare the results collected from teams all over the worlds.</P><P> </P><H2>Method and materials</H2><P><STRONG>Calibration protocols</STRONG></P><P>1.

	Day 1: transform Escherichia coli DH5α</P><P>Day 2: Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate it on 5 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol. Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37 °C and 220 rpm.</P><P>Day3: Cell growth, sampling, and assay
	Measured OD600 of the overnight cultures
	Diluted the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel (Dilution Calculation) Sheet_1)  in 15 mL falcon tube (covered with foil to block light).
	Incubated the cultures at 37 °C and 220 rpm.
	Took 500 µL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation (from 8 devices, in total 16 samples per point).
	At the end of sampling point, measured Abs 600 and Fluorescence.
	The measured fluorescence value was too strong and there were several error values, so we did the experiments from day2 again in following 2 days.</P><P>Day 4(Colony 1 only): Cell growth, sampling, and assay
	Measured OD600 of the overnight cultures
	Diluted the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel (Dilution Calculation) Sheet_1)  in 15 mL falcon tube (covered with foil to block light).
	Incubated the cultures at 37 °C and 220 rpm.
	Took 1000 µL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation (from 8 devices).
	(We forgot to place the samples on ice when we did this experiment of device 1.)
	Pipeted 100 µl into well into wells A-D (96 well plates, one is transparent and the other is black.)
	Measured Abs 600 and Fluorescence.</P><P>Day 5 (Colony 2): Cell growth, sampling, and assay
	Measured OD600 of the overnight cultures
	Diluted the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel (Dilution Calculation) Sheet_1)  in 15 mL falcon tube (covered with foil to block light).
	Incubated the cultures at 37 °C and 220 rpm.
	Took 1000 µL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation (from 8 devices).
	Pipeted 100 µl into well into wells E-F (96 well plates, one is transparent and the other is black.)
	Measured Abs 600 and Fluorescence.</P><P> </P><H2>Result</H2><P> The results of the OD600 measurement are on table 1 and figure 1. This data shows the growth of OD600 between 6 hours. In this data, OD600 of Device 1 and Device 4 are apparently low compared to the other devices. Other than these devices, the figure1 shows quite similar pattern of the growth.
	 The non-patterned result was observed in the measurement of the fluorescence. Many devices increased and decreased in each term.
	 Since the fluorescence's result affected to the absolute fluorescence, the absolute fluorescence also had a variation. But in all the devices, absolute fluorescence in 0h is the greatest. In positive control, negative control, device 1, device 2, and device 3, the absolute fluorescence decreased from 0h, but recovered a little in some point between 4h and 6h. In device 4, 5, and 6, the absolute fluorescence decreased over time. Device 3, device 5, device 6 shows little absolute fluorescence in all time. Especially in device 5 and 6, these 2 devices show little to no fluorescence. </P><P class="a">Table1. OD600 measurement
