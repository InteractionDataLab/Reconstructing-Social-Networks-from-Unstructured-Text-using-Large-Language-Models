Overview of the project
Our team's project goal is to synthesizing amino acids from nitrogen in the air. We thought of constructing the pathway  in Escherichia coli, and by introducing the products to intestine, it will be possible for people to use the synthesized amino acids. We devided into following three specific pathways. The First pathway is expressing nitrogenase to create ammonia from nitrogen gas. To express nitrogenase inside E.coli, we introduced there nif gene group and make them express. Although we want synthesized ammonia to be metabolized for synthesizing amino acids, acuumulated ammonia will be maybe used in ammonia metabolic pathway originally in E.coli. Therefore, as the second pathway, we used an inhibitor called MSX to inhibit ammonia to be metabolized by E.coli and make them acuumulated. And finally, by introducing and expressing genes of amino acid dehydrogenase, synthesize amino acids from ammonia. But this time we wanted to target on glutamic acid dehydrogenase and synthesize it. The above is the overview of our project.
System
NifBHDKENX hesA NifVSU
NifB: synthesize the enzymes needed for making the structure.
Synthesizing FeMoco structure needs Fe and S when synthesizing the small Fe-S fragment, and these small Fe-S fragments become FeMoco structure catalyzed by the enzyme purify NifB. (This structure starts by NifSU in high possibity?)
NifH：the nifH-encoded Fe protein (an essential factor for FeMoco maturation) allows the accumulation of a precursor form of FeMoco on NifEN.
NifH is used when nitrogen Fe protein (the factor necessary for maturing FeMoco) accumulate pre-FeMoco structure in NifE,N.
NifEN：FeMoco
NifEN is functioned as a scaffold protein for the maturation of FeMoco
FeMoco catalyzed with NifB is send to NifEN, and functioned as scaffold protein for maturing FeMoco.
NifX: Functions as modifying factor after translation, which control the important residue of protein for cluster formation.
Nif DK: Codes molybdenum-iron protein.
Nitrogenase is formed by Fe-protein and MoFe-protein encoded by NifH.
NifUS: NifUS is necessary for synthesizing Fe-s fragments, which is necessary as the one of the steps of synthesizing FeMoco structure. And synthesis of Fe-S fragments is done by the genes encoded by NifUS.
NifV: Encode the homocitrate synthase that supplies homocitrate for the biogenesis of FeMoco
Homocritrate is used for stabilizing FeMoco structure and bind with one of the FeMoco cofactors.
hesA: Forms acyladenylate complex that makes Sulfur move, and gets involved in the ATP dependant process which activates C-terminal of ubiquitin-like protein.

Indophenol results
Indophenol method is a way to quantify of ammonia by coloration. This time, we used indophenol method and measured the activity of nitrogenase that synthesizes ammonia.
Figure 1. The result of 24 hours cultivation of strain ATCC 15970
The micro tubes above are 100-fold dilution and the micro tube below is 10-fold dilution. From left, 1 Nitrogen-free medium only (negative control), 2 none, 3 none+MSX,4 gul, 5 gul+MSX,6 NH4Cl,7 NH4Cl+MSX.
In the samples of 24-hour cultivation, the bacteria didn’t grow enough and the nitrogen fixation hasn’t preceded enough. Among the sample ‘none’, ‘none+MSX’, ‘gul’, and ‘gul+MSX’, only ‘ none’ has colored. This is considered because by putting MSX, the amount of the bacteria decrease, so there are no bacteria colored in 24 hours. We don’t know why the glutamic acid-added-sample didn’t colored.
Figure 2. The result of 48 hours cultivation of strain ATCC 15970
These samples are all 100-fold dilution. 1 Negative control. 2 None, 3 none+MSX, 4 gul, 5 gul+MSX, 6 NH4Cl, 7 NH4Cl+MSX from left.
In the samples of 48-hour cultivation, other samples started to color. This is considered that as the bacteria grow and color, they start to synthesize ammonia. From this, we can say that that the genes from Paenibacillus polymyxa has correctly expressed in E.coli and has got nitrogenase activity.
Figure.3 The result of 72 hours cultivation of strain ATCC 15970
These samples are all 100-fold dilution. 1 Negative control. 2 None, 3 none+MSX, 4 gul, 5 gul+MSX, 6 NH4Cl, 7 NH4Cl+MSX from left.
Figure 4. The result of the absorbance of strain ATCC15970
In the samples of 72-hour cultivation, the color of the sample ‘none’ has become lighter, on the other hand, the color of the sample ‘none+MSX’ became darker. The coloration of MSX is because the bacteria which of glutamine synthase were inhibited by MSX and ammonia was accumulated have increased. The reason of the color of the sample ‘none’ got lighter is considered that the increase of ammonium concentration made the nitrogenase deactivation.
The color of the sample ‘none+MSX’ is darker compared to the sample with nothing, ‘none’. From this result, we can consider that       glutamine synthase was inhibited by MSX and the ammonia has accumulated.
When adding glutamic acid, we can estimate that the equilibrium of glutamine and glutamic acid collapse and the production of glutamine increase, making the accumulation of ammonia. However, from Figure 4, there is no increase of the activity. MSX wasn’t effective when glutamic acid was added. We can think that when glutamic acid was added, the nitrogen source that Paenibacillus polymyxa can use increases, the amount of bacteria increases.Because it is not measuring turbidity, we cannot confirm the result of adding glutamic acid.
When NH4Cl was added, it was dyed in dark blue, but the concentration of NH4Cl was high, so we are not sure if Paenibacillus       polymyxa synthesized ammonia.

NifB~hesA(none+ homocitrate 0.5 µL)
NifB~hesA(none+MSX+ homocitrate 0.5 µL)
Because these are 24-hour cultivation samples, there is no big change of the color, but some samples are colored lightly so we can know that ammonia was synthesized. The samples with MSX colored more darkly by the effect of MSX.

NifB~hesA(none+ homocitrate 0.5 µL)
NifB~hesA(none+MSX+ homocitrate 0.5 µL)
All samples colored darker than 24-hour cultivation samples. From the result, the difference of the amount of synthesized ammonia between the sample without MSX and the samples with MSX became conspicuous.
Figure 7. The result of indophenol method after 24-hour cultivation of strain ATCC15970, strain JM109 (nifB~hesA), and strain JM109 (only pHY). 10-fold dilution samples.
The top row: strain ATCC15970. From left, 1 none, 2 none+MSX, 3 homocitrate, 4 homocitrate +MSX.
The second row: strain JM109 (only pHY). From left, 5 none, 6 none+MSX’, 7 homocitrate, 8 homocitrate +MSX.
The third row: strain JM109 (pHY + nifB~hesA). From left, 9 none, 10 none+MSX, 11 homocitrate, 12 homocitrate +MSX.
・In strain ATCC15970, The effect of MSX hasn’t appeared, but the synthesis of ammonia can be confirmed by coloration. As you can know       from the result of figure 1,2,3 (10-fold dilution), MSX become effective as time passes.
・E.coli with plasmids but no insert of target genes (empty vectors), the sample ‘none’ wasn’t colored and the samples that       MSX was added colored. This is because synthesized ammonia is used for glutamine synthesis, making the sample ‘none’ un-colored.     When we inhibited glutamine synthase by MSX, ammonia is accumulated. Therefore, in terms of the coloration of the samples of       transformed E.coli with target genes, the sample ‘none’ is thought to be because of nitrogenase. And comparing the samples       with insert DNA and without insert DNA (empty vector), both with MSX, the coloration is darker in the samples with insert DNA, so the       effect of MSX can be confirmed.
・When adding citric acid, transformed E.coli didn’t colored. Homocitric acid is important substance of nitrogenase formation, but it seems homocitric acid worked as negative factor.
・The samples with both citric acid and MSX colored into blue. This is thought to be due to the effect of MSX.
Figure 8. The result of indophenol method after 48-hour cultivation of strain ATCC15970, strain JM109 (nifB~hesA), and strain JM109 (only pHY). 10-fold dilution samples.
The top row: strain ATCC15970. From left, 1 none, 2 none+MSX, 3 homocitrate, 4 homocitrate +MSX.
The second row: strain JM109 (only pHY). From left, 5 none, 6 none+MSX, 7 homocitrate, 8 homocitrate +MSX.
The third row: strain JM109 (pHY + nifB~hesA). From left, 9 none, 10 none+MSX, 11 homocitrate, 12 homocitrate +MSX.
In 48-hour cultivation samples, they colored darker compared to 24-hour cultivation samples. We considered that the amount of bacteria      increased and led the increase of the amount of accumulation of ammonia. However, we can’t see the difference of color by the effect      of MSX in strain ATCC.
