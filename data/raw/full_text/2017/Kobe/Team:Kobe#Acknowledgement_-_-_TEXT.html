As for the laboratory facilities, we are kindly hosted by Laboratory of Applied Microbiology (APPLMIC) at Department of Agriculture, Kobe University. They lent us all the equipment we need in iGEM activity.
We would like to especially thank Dr. Yoshida for hosting us to his laboratory and preparing everything we need to start the iGEM projects. We would also like to thank for his mentoring to our project. Without his help, we could not have done anything.
Dr. Tanaka and Dr. Ishikawa always supervised us in the lab,  providing us day to day support over this summer. Since this was the first time for all of us to work in the lab, his advice on the projects are of great help.
We would also like to thank all the APPLIMIC members for being patient and allowing us to share their lab space for our iGEM activity.
Finally, thanks to iGEM headquarters and our iGEM colleagues from all over the world sending us warm and encouraging messages to us.
