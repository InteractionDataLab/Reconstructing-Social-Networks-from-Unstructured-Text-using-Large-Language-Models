・iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
iGEM Japan Kansai Forum was held in Kyoto University. Team Kyoto , Team Nagahama , Team Gifu , Team Botchan Lab Tokyo , Team HokkaidoU_Japan ,         and many ex-members participated in this event and shared information about their teams and their projects.
Team Kobe also took part in this event. We made a presentation about our project, and listened to their presentations. As we participate in iGEM competition for the first time, all presentations were inspiring to us. We understood what other teams were planning at that time, and realized what we didn’t consider about our project. For example, Team Botchan_Lab_Tokyo inspired us to think more seriously about our human practice.
After each presentation, we had a Q&A session. During this session, many participants actively asked questions, and all teams including presenters could understand their projects more deeply. We team Kobe are also inspired by their good questions and these questions gave us an opportunity to review our project plan and to learn more about tea itself.
Besides Q&A sessions, all participants wrote feedbacks on questionnaires so that they could share their thoughts and improve their project.

・SATSUKI Festival
May 20 & 21, 2017
Team Kobe participated in SATSUKI (May) Festival at UT-Tokyo. This was the most exciting interaction with iGEM community during summer. We gave a poster presentation to other iGEM teams (Kyoto, Nagahama, Gifu, KAIT, Tokyo_Tech, Botchan Lab Tokyo, UT-Tokyo) and also listened to their presentation. We had a great time sharing project ideas and giving feedback each other. We made friends with many iGEMers. Thank you to all of them!
Team Gifu
Since Satsuki festival held in May, we've been keeping in touch with Team Gifu.
We, Team Kobe 2017, are the first iGEM team from Kobe University. During this summer, we were sometimes at a loss faced with many problems in experiments. However, every time we were, Team Gifu kindly helped us by offering troubleshooting tips for primer design, transformation...etc.
Team Kobe also helped them. As we were already successful in raising funds using crowdfunding at an early stage, we offered tips for successful crowdfunding to them.
On September 9th, we invited Ryo of Team Gifu to Kobe University. We talked over biosafety while looking at the "iGEM Safety illustration by Alejandra De La Fuente Menathe". We also discussed the possible biohazard risk that our chassis might cause and important safety rules we should follow in the lab.
At the end of the day, "pamphlet of tea-making"(by iGEM Team Kobe) was sent to Team Gifu as a token of our friendship. They are going to spread our work!
In October, we also got "pamphlet of Japanese Sake"(by iGEM Team Gifu). We are going to spread our work too!
Present from team Gifu
Team Kyoto
Team Kyoto was the first iGEM team we contacted. When we decided to establish iGEM team in Kobe University in 2015, They kindly supported our startup by inviting us to Kyoto University and telling some basic knowledge and tips for iGEM competition.
This year, they also helped us by providing us with KELN(Kyoto-team Electronic Lab Note), which helps to write a lab note by converting documents into HTML codes. In fact, we didn’t apply this tool to our lab note directly. However, it gave us an insight to automate conversion of our documents and tables into HTML, and it actually saved time to create our wiki.
As a token of appreciation, we summarized what we had realized while using KELN and sent it as a “Feedback on KELN”. We would be glad if this comment helps to improve KELN more so that it will be more useful for many iGEM teams.
Team Nagahama
In iGEM Japan Kansai Forum ,         we met Team Nagahama for the first time.
During the intermission, we and Nagahama talked freely, and shared activities with each other. Then, Nagahama told us that they were going to make a poster session in Hyper Interdisciplinary Conference , and suggested us that we also participate in this conference. Thankfully, they arranged so that we could make a poster session in the conference.
In Hyper Interdisciplinary Conference, we and Nagahama listened to each poster session and advised each other. We believed it was very helpful for both teams to demonstrate each project deeply by using poster and actively pointed out each weakness at an early stage. Besides, we had great experiences through this conference (Please see our human practice page for more information). We appreciate Team Nagahama offering us such great opportunities.
Moreover, we and Nagahama helped each other in terms of raising money. While we were struggling to raise money through crowdfunding, Nagahama actively and continuously spread our activity and information about crowdfunding. As our team was founded recently and not known well, we believed their help significantly contributed to our success of raising money. On the other hand, we also supported them while they were trying to raise money by spreading information and showing how we gathered money.
