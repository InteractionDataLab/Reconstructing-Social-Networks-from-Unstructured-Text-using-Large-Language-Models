Safety
The lab where we worked is classified as BSL 1.
All the members in our team attended a safety-training course and passed the test on biosafety at Kobe University. Our activity was registered and approved by Kobe University.
We all read through iGEMâ€™s Safety page before we started experiments, and had our own lab safety rules during this summer activity.
We chose B.subtilis for the chassis, which is proved to be non-pathogenic to humans.
To prevent the risk of unintended biohazard, our biosensor will be used in a kind of small box. Our engineered bacteria will never be released into the environment.
The parts we submitted have lacZ reporter gene and cat gene flanked by two recombination sites. The possible risks of using our parts are carefully discussed within the team.
We also discussed the safety rules with other iGEM teams .
