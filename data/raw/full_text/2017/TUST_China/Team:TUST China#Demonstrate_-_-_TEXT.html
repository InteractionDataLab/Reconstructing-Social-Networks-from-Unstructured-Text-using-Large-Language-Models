Part:BBa_K2267001 :This part can respond to pH in the environment and produce alkaline substances. Ultimately, it can stabilize the pH at around 5 in the environment.
Part:BBa_K2267005 , Part:BBa_K2267006 :These two parts are all composed of pASR and two key genes in the metabolic network of producing BC respectively. It enables G. xylinus to produce BC more effectively.
We  have determined the optimal fermentation condition for the co-culture of G. xylinus&E. coli. We have co-cultured these two modified strains in such condition and resulted a significant increase in the yield of bacterial cellulose.
During the experiments, we have visited companies and communicated in depth with technical personnel in this field about the design of our experiment and feasibility in the actual production process(including operation procedure and possibility for bio-contamination). They speak highly of our project and offer us potential collaboration in the future.
After processing BC membrane produced in our lab, we sent samples to a wound dressing material company for quality check. The report we received demonstrates that our lab-produced bacterial cellulose is qualified in every base items and shows potential to be wound dressing materials. We make sure all the works we done are in accordance with the safety requirements from iGEM committee and our product is absolutely free of living organisms outside the lab.
