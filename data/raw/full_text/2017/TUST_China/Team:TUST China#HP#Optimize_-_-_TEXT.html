Optimize The Project
Attending lecture in Peking
This year we communicated with Peking team. Because most of TUST-CHINA’s team members were freshmen for iGEM , some of us went to their school to learn some basic knowledge of synthetic biology on the end of January 2017. We also shared our experiences concerning biology and our love for sciences and practical lab work. We all cherish the opportunity to collaborate and we do have a brand new understanding of synthetic biology ,a lot of gains.
Communication with Peking
This May, we organized a meeting and invited Yihao Zhang ,the instructor of team Peking and Haoqian Zhang who have got a lot of medals in iGEM game. We introduced our project to them. The entire team was involved, and this allowed members to chat and ask questions. The level of enthusiasm from Peking team members was extremely encouraging, and we have a lot of gains again.
Five Teams Meetup
In order to meet, socialise and discuss projects , TUST China, Jilin China, NWPU, NKU China and Tianjin iGEM team had a meeting in Tianjin on August 1, 2017. We invited and encouraged other team members to look at our designs and think about how they might alter them. The level of enthusiasm from other team members was extremely encouraging, and we were very surprised by the number of questions. We were also inspired by the questions and we will do our best to improve our project. We may also cooperate with other teams in the future.
Conference of Central China iGEM Consortium
From August 26th to 28th, Conference of Central China iGEM Consortium (CCiC) was held in FAFU, FuJian. six members of our team attended the conference.With the help of this platform for Chinese iGEM teams to communicate, all the teams got numerous feedbacks from others, including suggestions on the of experiments, heated discussions on circuit design, and reflections on safety and application. TUST performed well during the presentation and poster section and provided many useful suggestions for other iGEM teams during communication.It’s worth mentioning that we won the award of the best poster.
BC factory visit
As we near the end of the project, we would like to know the BC factory's view of our work and the production of some BC products. So we visited Shandong Nameide Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Their product is named Nanuomei - a bacterial cellulite wound dressing.
The company's R & D manager received us and took us to visit the production workshop. She introduced us their mode of producing, which is quit different from the mode of producing BC in our laboratory. For example, in the lab we used the conical flask to produce BC. however, BC was produced in a huge metal tray in the factory.
Besides, We introduced our iGEM project to her and asked her what she thought about it. She thought our work was very meaningful and has been achieved increasing BC production, but she had doubts about whether it is suitable for the factory because the production methods and the production environment is totally different.
We plan to test the results of our iGEM project in the factory in the future. And we hope that our project can increase the production of BC not only in the lab but also in the factory.                             This trip we have gained a lot and we are more confident that our project is useful and meaningful.
