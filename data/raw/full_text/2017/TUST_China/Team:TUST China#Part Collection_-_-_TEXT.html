TUST-iGEM 2017 team members are committed to the establishment of a wide range of diverse parts library. We have been able to alter the genes that can change the pH of the environment of G.xylinus, the genes that can increase the amount of bacterial cellulose produced by G.xylinus, and the genes that can endow BC with new properties.
Our members are involved in the construction of the parts, and has achieved some results. The functions of all components are tested and validated under controlled laboratory conditions and normal conditions, and data and phenomena demonstrate that they are valid. At the same time, all components are standardized, which makes them a convenient and powerful tool for others.
