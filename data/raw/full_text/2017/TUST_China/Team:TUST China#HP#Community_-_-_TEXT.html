Attending lecture in Peking
This year we communicated with Peking team. Because most of TUST-CHINA's team members were freshmen for iGEM , some of us went to their school to learn some basic knowledge of synthetic biology on the end of January 2017. We also shared our experiences concerning biology and our love for sciences and practical lab work. We all cherish the opportunity to collaborate and we do have a brand new understanding of synthetic biology ,a lot of gains.
Seminar with Tianjin University
In early March 2017, our project was in the initial design stage. We went to Tianjin university and communicated with team iGEM-Tianjin. We introduced our projects and give suggestions to each other. Everyone  was involved, and this allowed members to discuss and ask questions.
We all got new inspiration for the project. We are also had a meeting with SynBioBeta founder John Cumbers, Vice President of Tianjin University Yuan Yingjin, John Hugh snyder, Director of the Beijing Institute of Life Sciences, Wu Feng, Associate Professor of Beijing Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ma Rui, Investor of FreesVC, etc. We asked questions about synthetic biology and iGEM, and John Cumbers responded patiently to the questions.
Seminar with Peking
This May, we organized a meeting and invited Yihao Zhang ,the instructor of team Peking and Haoqian Zhang who have got a lot of medals in iGEM game. We introduced our project to them. The entire team was involved, and this allowed members to chat and ask questions. The level of enthusiasm from Peking team members was extremely encouraging, and we have a lot of gains again.
Five Teams Meetup

Conference of Central China iGEM Community(CCiC)
From August 26th to 28th, Conference of Central China iGEM Community (CCiC) was held in FA-FU, FuJian. We sent 6 members to attend this meeting. With the help of exchanging ideas, all the teams got numerous feedbacks from others, including suggestions on the of experiments, heated discussions on circuit design, and reflections on safety and application. TUST_China performed well during the presentation and poster section. Meanwhile, we also provided many useful suggestions to other iGEM teams during communication. It's worth mentioning that we won the award of the best poster.
