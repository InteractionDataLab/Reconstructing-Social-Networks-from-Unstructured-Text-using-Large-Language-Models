G. xylinus Culturing
Inoculum activation
Harvest a loop of bacteria from Agar Slant using inoculation loop, inoculating it onto 50ml seed culture media (containing 4%（V/V） cellulolytic enzyme)  in 250ml triangular flask. Incubate at 180 r/min，30℃,  until its OD600 reach to 0.4~0.6, and save it as seed solution for later use.
Preparation for seed solution
Inoculate the seed solution into 200mL seed culture media (containing 4%（V/V） cellulolytic enzyme)in 500mL triangular flask. Incubate at 30℃，180r/min in shaker for 24 hours until the OD600 reach to 0.5.

Following 4.5%(V/V) inoculum size, innoculate the seeds into the 200mL broth culture medium in 500mL triangular flask. Incubate at 30℃，180r/min in shaker for 120 hours.
Stationary culture
Following 4.5%(V/V) inoculum size, innoculate the seeds into the 200mL broth culture medium in 500mL triangular flask. Incubate at 30℃ in incubator.
Preparation for competence and Transformation of G. xylinus
Preparation of electro-competent G,xylinus cells(Imperial)
If the goal of transformation is to produce cellulose-producing transformed G.xylinus, use regular HS media for culturing. If cellulose production after transformation is not primary and speed is required, HS-cellulase medium can be used. Usage of HS-cellulase medium during growth results in the formation of a higher number of cellulose negative mutants, but results in much higher transformation efficiencies, and requires less time. Even with HS-cellulose medium, cellulose producing colonies can be identified on the plate after transformation, as cellulose-producing colonies differ in morphology from cellulose non-producing colonies (see section Gluconacetobacter for images of colony morphology).
