Composite Part
LuxR-I-Plux-GFP
This composite part is based on the Lux quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischerii. It consists of a Lux receiver device and a GFP reporter that is activated in the presence of a 3O-C6 AHL signal.
Quorum sensing is a naturally occurring mechanism that certain strains of bacteria use to regulate gene expression in response to their population density. These bacteria secrete autoinducer signalling molecules, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), that bind to transcription factors to alter gene expression.
In this case, the constitutively expressed LuxR transcriptional regulator (C0062) is activated by the binding of 3O-C6 AHL, an AHL quorum signal. The activated LuxR regulator binds to a LuxR-inducible promoter, pLux, upstream of a GFP reporter. As a result, GFP is expressed when the receiver device is induced with 3O-C6 AHL. We designed this part to characterize the activation range of the Lux receiver device.
