The formula of culture media and the condition of culturing in fermentation have direct or indirect relations with these issues. Particularly, pH can affect the dissociation of some certain components and intermediate metabolites ，which can influence the capacity utilizing these materials of bacteria. Meanwhile, the fluctuant environmental pH  have certain impact on the pH level in the cells in the form of weak acid and alkali influencing the metabolic reaction of the cell. Therefore, an appropriate control of pH is crucial to the effective gene expression. That is the reason why  we need to  discover the optimal pH for the fermentation of <I>G.xylinus</I>.
                                The scope of pH variation in the culture media during fermentation process is wide. In order to study the optimal pH for <I>G.xylinus</I> fermentation, we use acetic acid with 200 ionic strength to maintain the pH in the outside environment.</P><P>The scope of pH variation in the culture media during fermentation process is huge.

We have processed the membrane collected after 10 days of fermentation and the table below is the data we have collected.</P><P>As the statistics show, when pH=5.75～5.25 ,the yield of BC the most optimal.Meanwhile, when pH=5.25 and 4.75, the yield of BC are higher than the control group by 11% and 7%.</P><P>Therefore, we hope we can maintain the pH at 5 in the environment during <I>G.xylinus</I> fermentation.</P></LI></UL><H3 id="section-1-2">Transformation  of<I> E.coli</I></H3><UL><LI><P>Due to the production of acidic substances like glucuronic acid during <I>G.xylinus</I> fermentation, the accumulation of acidic compounds lead to the decrease in pH. In order to maintain the optimal pH for producing bacterial cellulose, a mechanism to produce alkali substances is required. We choose model strain <I>E.coli</I> considering its benefits such as having a clear genetic background, easy technical operation and short culture time. Therefore,we plan to modify <I>E.coli</I> to have the ability to respond to the variation of pH and enable it to produce alkali substances when the environment is acidic enough. Hence, the alkali substances produced can maintain the optimal pH for <I>G.xylinus</I> to produce BC.</P><P>First, we need to find a switch with the function of sensing the pH level in the environment and respond accordingly. Luckily, we have identified a proton type of promoter P-asr located on the activator protein binding domain. When pH is around 5, it can activate RNA polymerase to combine with template DNA precisely resulting in the expression of downstream sequence. The pH for the activation of P-asr is very close to the optimal  pH for producing BC. Therefore, we decide to use P-asr as our switch.</P><P>After that, we have identified a gene GlsA with the function of producing alkali substances via the expression of glutaminase. This enzyme can catalyse the conversion of  glutamine and water to glutamate and ammonia. The ammonia will combine with H<SUP>+</SUP> to increase the pH in the environment.</P><P>We have verified its capability of producing alkali in DH5α </P><P>Based on what we have acessed, we know that GlsA is activated when the pH is below 6. The graph above also demonstrates that the pH variation in the culture media of <I>E.coli</I> also fluctuate around 6.</P><P>We add the gene of P-asr before the gene of glsa and construct a plasmid with pet28 as the backbone. We then transform it into <I>E.coli</I> DH5α  and test the variation of pH during fermentation. The results is presented by the line graph below and we put it in comparison with the one with empty plasmid and the one with only GlsA. We can observe that the pH is maintaining at around 5. </P><P>We put the transformed E.coli in co-culture with the transformed G.xylinus, detected the BC film they produced. The data are as follows.</P></LI></UL><H3 id="section-1-3">Control of Population Level</H3><UL><LI><P>We worry that the if the cell concentration of E.coli is too high, E.coli will compete with G.xylinus for nutrients leading to an negative impact on its growth. Therefore, we introduce Quorum sensing system and autophagy gene φx174E in E.coli. </P><P>In order to control population levels , we engineered a synchronized lysis circuit (SLC) using cou- pled positive and negative feedback loops that have previously been used to generate robust oscillatory dynamics. The circuit(BBa_K2267040) consists of a common promoter that drives expression of both its own activator (positive feedback) and a lysis gene (negative feedback). </P><P>Specifically, the luxI promoter regulates production of autoinducer (AHL), which binds LuxR and enables it to transcriptionally activate the promoter. Negative feedback arises from cell death that is triggered by a bacteriophage lysis gene (φX174 E) which is also under control of the luxI promoter. AHL can diffuse to neighbouring cells and thus provides an intercellular synchronization mechanism.</P><P>Quorum-sensing bacteria produce and release chemical signal molecules termed autoinducers whose external concentration increases as a function of increasing cell-population density. </P><P>Bacteria detect the accumulation of a minimal threshold stimulatory concentration of these autoinducers and alter gene expression, and therefore behavior, in response. Using these signal-response systems, bacteria synchronize particular behaviors on a population-wide scale and thus function as multicellular organisms.</P><P>We modify the plux hoping to increase its sensitivity and we choose to conduct point mutation in the region of -10 according to the literature. Down below is the exact mutaion point and we add an indicator gfp after plux. We try to acquire a plux with higher sensitivity via modelling.</P><P>The bacterial population dynamics arising from the synchronized lysis circuit can be conceptualized as a slow build-up of the signalling molecule (AHL) to a threshold level, followed by a lysis event that rapidly prunes the population 。 After lysis, a small number of remaining bacteria begin to produce AHL anew, allowing the ‘integrate and fire’ process to be repeated in a cyclical fashion. We  observe growth  with the fluorescent protein superfolder GFP (sfGFP).</P></LI></UL><H3 id="section-1-4">Reference</H3><OL><LI>A Glutamate-Dependent Acid Resistance Gene in Escherichia coli</LI><LI>Functional and Structural Characterization of Four Glutaminases from Escherichia coli and

In prokaryotic organisms, bacterial cellulose is synthesized mainly by <I>Gluconacetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Escherichia, Enterobacter</I> and <I>salmonella</I>. In nature, only bacteria can synthesize cellulose pellicle with water-holding texture, among which the most studied bacteria are the genus Gluconacetobacter. Several common strains in the genus Gluconacetobacter can be distinguished by different representations. Bacteria that can synthesize bacterial cellulose are mainly <I>G. Europaeus, G. intermedius, G. Oboediens, G. Nataicola, G. Sacchari</I> and <I>G.xylinus</I>. Researchers have been studying the biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose in recent decades. This <I>G.xylinus</I> has long been recognized as a model strain. Many classical cellulose synthesis pathways and regulatory models were obtained in <I>G.xylinus</I>. Therefore,we choose <I>G.xylinus</I> as the research object in this experiment.</P><P>The biosynthesis pathway of bacterial cellulose in <I>G.xylinus</I> is complicated including the synthesis of cellulose precursor, polymerization of glucan monomers and assembly of glucan chains.</P><P>The biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose begins with the conversion of substrates to cellulose precursors, which are usually carbon sources, such as the conversion of glucose to uridine diphosphate glucose (udp-glucose). Uridine diphosphate glucose is the substrate of cellulose synthase, and it is catalyzed by cellulose synthase to form β-1 and 4 glucoside bonds between glucose monomers. There are specific sites on the outer membranes of the bacterial cells, which are coupled with the cellulose synthase complexes and is the spot where the polymerization is conducted [9]. When the polymerization reaction is over, the newly generated cellulose is secreted to the extracellular through these sites. The following figure is a partial schematic of the production of cellulose by <I>G. xylinus</I></P><P>We hope to optimize the metabolic pathway of bacterial cellulose, redirecting more carbon sources into the production of bacterial cellulose; meanwhile expressing key genes in BC synthesis process.

Bacteria utilize it to perceive cell surface signals and activate targets within cells, which involves amplification of the original signal and the subsequent expression of a series of specific genes in the cell. These genes affects the various physiological and biochemical processes in the cells. c-di-GMP control a wide range of process, and has a role in transcription, translation and post-translation levels. In addition, c-di-GMP participates in the regulation of  multiple biological functions and affects biofilm formation. In a nutshell, it is a crucial elements to the formation of membrane-like bacterial cellulose and the improvement of BC production.</P><P> This experiment attempts to improve BC production by over-expressing PGM and c-di-GMP, a small signal transfer molecule of bacteria.the goal is to implement both to realize the high yield of BC.</P><P> The process of the experiment is divided into following steps, firstly, we   transform the constructed plasmids into the E. coli DH5α.

The absorption peak at about 1060 cm-1 reflects the vibration of the C-O-C group, which is the characteristic absorption peak of the cellulose. The absorption peak at 1428 cm-1 is caused by the bending vibration of the C-H bond, and the depth is related to the crystallinity of the cellulose. Although the infrared spectrum is a simple method, it can only give a relative value, it can show whether is a crystalline phase or non-crystalline phase at one time.

After researching relevant literature,we assume that due to the fact that G6P plays a significant role in the whole metabolic network, over expressing PGM may affect the direction of energy flux in the network. Therefore, the energy in the route of producing BC is going down leading to no increase in the yield of BC. On the other hand, perhaps the reaction PGM catalyzed is not a rate-limiting step or the overexpression of PGM hasn’t improve the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction. Other then that, it is very possible that there are still factors that we haven’t covered influencing the whole metabolic process and the yields of BC.</P><P> Therefore.in the future, we might consider to modify or overexpress UGP which catalyze a rate-limiting reaction and explore its effect on the yields of BC</P><P>Bacterial cellulose is already a useful biomaterial as is due its attractive mechanical properties. So we want to make and characterise new cellulose binding domains, and fuse them to functional proteins. In our project, the bingding domains are the spytag and its catcher parts--spycatcher. We have designed a new spytag, including its RBS region, and make spytag link with GFP protein genes. We would verificate the catching power about this parts and do more experiments to give more functional properties into the bacterial cellulose.</P><P>As we have increase the yield of bacteria cellulose fulfiling the protection of the membrance will wake the BC functional
                                Since the BC membrance is accepted due to its mechanical properties，we would like to introduce another system to add new characteries to our product.
                                According to the project of team Peking 2016 and resegrd papers we want to introduce the spytag-spychther system which is commonly used for binding. labeling immobilization and creating new kinds of application.
                                We culture G.xylinus with the E.coli which can produce small peptid in the culture media evenly；thus， the spycather can be inlaid with BC membrance.
                                The functional protein can be fused with spytag and be expressed bu the E.coli eddicieatly. We fuse the spytag with GFP.</P></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 contents-sidebar" id="navScrollspy"><UL class="nav nav-stacked text-left" id="navwrap"><LI class="active"><A href="#section-1">Optimization of Fermentation Conditions</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-1-1">Optimal pH</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-1-2">Modification of<I> E.coli</I></A></LI><LI><A href="#section-1-3">Control of Population Level</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-1-4">Reference</A></LI></UL><LI><A href="#section-2">The Establishment of Co-Culture System</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-3">Optimization of Metabolic Pathway</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-3-1">Description</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-3-2">Design &amp; Engineering</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-3-3">Results</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-1-4">Reference</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-4">BC Property Testing</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-4-1">Overview</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-4-2">SEM</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-4-3">FTIR</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-4-4">Quality</A></LI><LI><A href="#section-5">Futurework</A></LI></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><DIV class="container" style="padding: 0"><DIV class="row" id="footerul"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="col-lg-9"><UL class="list-inline text-center"><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Description" target="_blank">PROJECT</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Description" target="_blank">Description</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Design" target="_blank">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Results/Ecoli" target="_blank"><EM>G.xylinus</EM></A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Results/Co_Culture" target="_blank">Co-Culture</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Results/More_BC" target="_blank">BC Testing</A></LI></UL><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Model" target="_blank">MODELLING</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Achievement" target="_blank">ACHIEVEMENT</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Parts" target="_blank">PARTS</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Safety">Safety</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Parts" target="_blank">Parts</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Collaborations" target="_blank">Collaborations</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Human_Practices" target="_blank">HUMAN PRACTICES</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Human_Practices" target="_blank">Summary </A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/HP/Gold_Integrated" target="_blank">Integrated and Gold</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/HP/Silver" target="_blank">Silver HP</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Engagement" target="_blank">Public Engagement</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/HP/Community" target="_blank">iGEM Community</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Notebook" target="_blank">NOTOBOOK</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Experiments" target="_blank">Protocol</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Team" target="_blank">TEAM</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TUST_China/Attributions" target="_blank">Attributions</A></LI></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-3"><UL style="float: right"><LI><A href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100017660174367">  TUST iGEM
