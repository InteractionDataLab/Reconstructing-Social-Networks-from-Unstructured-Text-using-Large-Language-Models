What they said about us!
"We are glad to receive the amazing result and appreciate your hard work. The collaboration is absolutely meaningful to our team owing to your contribution..."
"The conclusion of our collaboration reminds us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration. In fact, we have conducted a functional test for determining the capability of NrtA with a semi-permeable membrane system..."
iGEM chile
We collaborated with iGEM Chile Biotec to discuss each                                   other’s project and suggest improvements. They briefed us about usage of aptamers for detection of heavy metals to improve our project. We identified various possible complications in their project and suggested them appropriate solutions.
What They needed!
They needed us to analyze their project, and identify possible complications.
They sent us their project which can be viewed below:

We collaborated with iGEM DU Dresden to                                 calculate carbon footprint of our lab, trip to Boston, and to make a                                 awareness video for general public.
iGEM Uppsala
iGEM Uppsala organized online discussion on ethics related to genetic engineering, social responsibility, and intellectual property rights (IPR). We participated in discussion on ethics of IPR.
iGEM Technion Israel
iGEM Technion Israel organized tolerance photo                                  challenge in which each collaborating team had                                   to capture a video for their team showing tolerance                                   for team members irrespective of any discriminating                                   background. We collaborated with them                                   for the tolerance photo challenge.
iGEM Michigan
GEM Michigan developed an online protocol catalogue named ProtoCat. We collaborated with iGEM Michigan Software to beta test their software in                       various aspects of it’s version 4.0.
iGEM Franconia
We collaborated with iGEM Franconia to design a biological themed card game.                        The game contains various cards of pathogens, antimicrobial agents, and similar                         things which are designed by teams collaborating in designing this game.

iGEM Sheffield
iGEM Sheffield’s this year project is about development of a device                       for detection of multidrug resistance (MDR) specifically in urinary                       tract infections (UTIs). We gathered data about prevalence of MDR in Pakistan,                        the tests used by physicians for detection of MDR, and the way they prescribe                         medicines for MDR infections.
