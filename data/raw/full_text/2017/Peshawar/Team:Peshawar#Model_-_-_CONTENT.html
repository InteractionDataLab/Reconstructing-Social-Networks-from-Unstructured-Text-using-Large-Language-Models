Modeling your system before actually building it is extremely important because it offers unique insights into design and execution. This year, our modeling approach was unique and multi-dimensional. We worked on a unique theory regarding reporter expression times - IDDP Theory, we calculated an estimate of the contraction that takes place in 2 of our promoters during transcriptional factor binding and also conducted homology modelling to predict the structure of the chromo-proteins we intend to use. You can read about all of these in detail, below:

                IDDP stands for Increase Device and Decrease Plasmid Theory, it states that if we halve the number of plasmids but double the number of device per plasmid then we will going to have detectable expression in less time.

                  <P style="padding-top:10px">For example: a cell A contains 300 plasmids with each plasmid containing 1 device and cell B contains half the number of plasmids i.e. 150 but double the number of device per plasmid that is 2 then the detectable expression of cell B will be in less time compared to cell A.</P><P>Let’s zoom into both of the cells and look at single plasmid of each cell, take a picture at any instance of time and analyze that picture to see the effect of our doubling of device per plasmid.

</P><H4 style="padding-top:30px">Predicted Structure</H4><P>This is a 3D structure that we build through homology modeling between template and target structure and sequence respectively.
</P><H4 style="padding-top:30px">Result and Discussion</H4><H5 style="padding-top:30px">GMQE (Global Model Quality Estimation):</H5><P>GMQE, Stands for Global Model Quality Estimation, is a parameter for checking the quality of target template alignment and templet search. The value for this parameter varies from 0 to 1, the more positive the result is the more positive the alignment and search will be. GMQE Value score for our work is<B> 0.98</B>, this is a good result.
</P><P>The value of GMQE for our homology model is <B>0.98</B> that is a positive result. <B>Hence the build model is of good quality.</B></P><H5 style="padding-top:30px">QMEAN:</H5><P>QMEAN is a scoring function that looks for a global and well as local quality estimation of the residues found in the homology model. Results higher than -4.0 are considered as good results but the lower results shows a bad agreement between the model and the template. Our QMEAN Score is <B>-0.13</B> which is a pretty good score.
</P><P>Our QMEAN value is <B>-0.13</B>, which is a good result,<B> showing the model is of good quality.</B></P><H5 style="padding-top:30px">LocalQuality:</H5><P>Local quality calculates the similarity between each residue of the homology model against the structurally similar pdb model. If the value is laying below 0.6 the model is not of good quality but our results almost reaches the value of<B> 1</B>, which is a relatively good result for our model.</P><H5 style="padding-top:30px">Comparison plot:</H5><P>In comparison plot, the x axis shows the length of the modeled protein represented as residues and the y axis shows the QMEAN score.
   Every dot in a graph represent a non-redundant 3d protein model. There are three types of dot present in the graph sorted by different QMEAN Scores given below.
    It is evident from the graph below that our build model <B>(RED STAR)</B> is in a dark gray portion, which is actually a pretty good score and in turn is  prove that the homology model we build for our FP is surely is of a good quality.</P><P><B>It is evident from the homology analysis above that the model build of our given FP is of Good quality.</B></P><H4 style="padding-top:30px">References</H4><UL><LI>Biasini M, Bienert S, Waterhouse A, Arnold K, Studer G, Schmidt T, Kiefer F, Cassarino TG, Bertoni M, Bordoli L, Schwede T (2014).
