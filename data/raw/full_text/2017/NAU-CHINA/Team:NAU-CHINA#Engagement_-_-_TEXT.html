Education and public engagement
We are fully engaged in various educational events and         workshops using different communication channels         with different groups of people.          From the following activities, we not only spread our thinking but also absorbed different ideas from various walks of life.
 
We truly had a feel that it is the communication contributes a better job.         At first, we just wanted to introduce our project to the public. But it turned         out people gained a new interest and a wider approach to science and the world. At the same time, we took in new creation and suggestion that inspired us a lot!
We also made presentations to introduce synthetic biology, iGEM competitions        and the project carried out by our team to students in high school and our university. We sincerely hope that increasing people will know us and join us.
We may further initiate to educate the public.
Innovative talk in campus
Time: 2016.12.11 ；2017.5.19
Location: NAU campus
2016.12.11
2017.5.19
Our talk attracted more than 400 students, most of them are impressed by our fantastic ideas.
Aim:
1、Letting scientific project exert real impact on the society, we would like to spread our project and the culture of iGEM
2、We seized this chance to learn how to teach people without standard knowledge of synthetic biology
3、We exchanged ideas about synthetic biology .
4、Introducing the iGEM competition as an example of student-directed scientific experiments on self-selected research topics.
5、Encouraging freshman to seek their own interests actively, join in laboratories and participate in biological research. 
6、Teaching freshman how to get papers from some databases and how to get in touch with professors.After the Campus Talk, we found that a lot of students are interested in our team, the iGEM competition and our project. So, we held in the university iGEM Campus Trials and recruited 2018 NAU_CHINA team members.

Have a Look！
Agar art
Time:2017.3.10
LOCATION: NAU CAMPUS
JUDGING CRITERIA:
1、creativity、originality in technique, organism(s) used
2、overall artistry of design
3、oral presentation（appropriateness of description for a general audience）
Agar art is a competition about painting with the microbes. It’s created by American society for microbiology(ASM). And it’s a public competition, so people from any country and any age can take part in it.
We held a campus competition - agar art to encourage everyone go into the laboratory and learn more about microbiology. Our teammates use the professional knowledge to instruct participants to paint on agar plates.
It turned very successful, over 60 teams submitted the application forms to us.
Finally，some groups did great works.
Science fair
Time: 2017.9.27
Location: Yu Lan Road, Nanjing
Missions we aimed:
1.Reaching out to students of different ages and introduce our project to them.
2. Introducing Fusarium head blight to the public and inform them the damage          of wheat scab in everyday life.
3．Questionnaire survey about our project and          biosafety.
4. Laboratory safety.
Giving courses for students of Jinling High School
Time: 2017.9.30
Location: Jinling High School, Nanjing
Missions we aimed:
1.To reach out to students of different ages and promote our project to them.
2. Facilitating high school students to Exchange ideas and innovations，introducing synthetic biology to them ，arousing the high school students’ interests
3．We would like to encourage more potential iGEMers to join us.
Handbook
Foundational science can be difficult for non-specialists to understand and engage with. So we created a handbook to introduce our project to almost all far          mlands in Nanjing and students in our university and a high school in Nanjing.
