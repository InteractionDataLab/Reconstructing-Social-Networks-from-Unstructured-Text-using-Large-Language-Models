We have always been a student run team; founded and led by students. Our instructors, advisors, and mentors have aided us
when we needed their help. NAU-CHINA iGEM team members
were responsible for almost all parts of running our iGEM
team:brainstorming, background research, organizing
workshops and events, project design, searching
protocols,  ordering supplies and lab works.
Student
Chenrui Qin is the leader of Team NAU-CHINA in 2017. Her primary responsibilities include recruiting the team, leading the design of the project, fundraising for project expenditure, hosting a workshop and interacting with other IGEM teams, and coordinating between instructors and team members. She also delivered several work update reports to our supervisors.
Wet Lab Experiments
Our project consists of multiple wet lab modules.
Yuanqi Jia is the vice leader of Team NAU-CHINA in 2017. She is t is the vice leader of Team NAU-CHINA in 2017. She is t is the vice leader of Team NAU-CHINA in 2017. She is anti-fungal peptidesplant defensins.
Xinyi Jiawas responsible for the expression of antifungal peptide cecropin A and its functional verification.
Linlin Chen was in charge of plasmid construction and yeast transformation experiment.
Long Yuan contributed to the initial design of the project and the expression of antifungal peptide. He was in charge of editing and establishing the framework of our Wiki page.
Zhaoxi Liu assisted in the construction of the suicidal system and sensing module. She participated actively in the production of a short video. 
Hangyu Duan constructed the plasmids for kill switch module as well as the following yeast experiments.
Tong Cheng is a molecular cloning master in the team and constructed a majority of BioBricks.
Yaxuan Wu was in charge of establishing the framework of our Wiki page, constructing a “DON” -degrading enzyme expression plasmid for the following targeting test.
Wan Chen was in charge of testing the prokaryotic expression of ZEN degrading enzyme.
Yueyue li constructed BioBricks in PSB1C3 plasmid and assisted in the testing function of ZEN degrading enzyme.
Wei Wang and Yuqian  Jiang were in charge of the interlab study experiment and constructing the Yeast promotor-recombinant plasmids. Wei Wang also made his efforts in drawing the DON standard curve using HPLC and testing blue light induction-photoactivatable genetic switches.
Wet Lab Experiments
Qili Qian and Wei Chen established an evaluation model to filter which antifungal peptide mostly suits for our project, and some dynamic models to predict our sensing module、degrading module and kill switch module. In order to make the results more intuitive, they simulated our models by MATLAB. For some results, they use GUI to make it visualizable.
Software
Qiaomu Ren was responsible for the part of software. He proposed a method to detect wheat scab basing on machine learning. He also analyzed information visually basing on information retrieval and natural language processing.
Human Practice
Ruixuan Guo was mainly responsible for the work of Human Practice in this year's competition, mainly including a series of publicity education activities and project investigation and promotion activities. She and her partners participated in workshop, campus  propaganda, in-depth investigation, questionnaire production and so on.
Yi Zhang engaged actively with the public. She communicated with professors and other iGEM teams and did the field investigation and soical investigation. She also involved in the arrangement of some daily affairs.
Shengzhe Li was involved in the arrangement of some Daily affairs. He also took major part in uploading wiki contents online.
Wiki Construction
World Ma ;World Wu and Guanghu Zhang took major part in uploading wiki contents online and  were in charge of the coding of our wiki.
Art design
Yajing Weng and Shu Huang are fantastic designers. They designed most of the artwork used in our Wiki page, as well as in the presentation and on the poster.
