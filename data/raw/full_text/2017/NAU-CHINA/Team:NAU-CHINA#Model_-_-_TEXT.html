Model
This year, we design a yeast system to produce antifungl                                       peptide which inhibits the activity of Fusarium graminearum,                                       the pathogen of wheat scab. To choose the suitable antifungl                                       peptide, we establish an evaluation model and want to know                                        which antimicrobial peptide gets the highest score.
We also design a complex system to sense and degrade the                                       toxin produced by Fusarium graminearum. Sensing and                                       degrading are dynamic processes so dynamic model is a good                                       choice to represent this part. Since the expression of degradation                                       enzymes are controlled by engineered photoactivatable switch,                                       we consider photochemical reaction kinetics and it performs                                       well.                                       In the same system, we put in a kill switch into the yeast. Yeast                                       will die without galactose induction so the safety of the system                                       is ensured. You can see how the yeast die by our model.
Antifungl Peptide Part
We intend to use yeast system to produce a large number                                           of antifungl peptides to kill Fusarium graminearum which                                           causes the wheat scab. Therefore, the selection of antifungl                                           peptide is very important.
We searched for some antimicrobial peptide databases like                                           Peptaibol Database, Defensin Knowledgebase, MiniCOPE,                                           APD and so on. Finally, we found 20 antimicrobial peptides                                           that inhibit the activity of Fusarium graminearum.
The ideal antifungl peptide should have the following                                                   characteristics:
(1) Being harmless to host cells.
(2) Being harmless to the human body.
(3) Having little damage on microbes in the soil.
Therefore, we set effective antifungl concentration, Activity                                               object, half-life as three indexs, and established an evaluation                                               model to evaluate if the peptide is suitable for our project.
Figure 1 : The scores of different antifungl peptides
Finally, we choose PDC1 and cecropin A to kill Fusarium                                               graminearum. They can inhibit the growth of Fusarium                                               graminearum in a very low concentration(1.5μM、3.6μM),                                               PDC1 is specific for Fusarium graminearum.
Sensing Part
We intend to sense toxins through the yeast system. In the                                           sensing part, estrogen receptor is secreted by constitutive                                           promoter, and then binding to the membrane. ZEN comes                                           into the cell via the receptor-mediated endocytosis process,                                           the endocytosis complex will activate ERE(estrogen response                                           element) which incorporated with a yeast promoter and the                                           promoter begin to express fluorescent protein.
Figure 2 : Schematic diagram of the sensing part
In order to observe the fluorescence intensity in different                                           concentrations of ZEN and the corresponding reaction time.                                           We set a dynamic model by some differential equations:
Simulation
In different ZEN concentrations, the system will express different                                           intensities of fluorescent protein. We use MATLAB GUI to                                           simulate the process.
Figure3: Simulation result
You can adjust the ZEN concentration and observe the change                                           of protein concentration. According to the Chinese National                                           Standards For Food Safety, ZEN’s concentration should not                                           high than 0.015 mg/L. If the concentration of ZEN is higher                                           than the level, the device will sense the fluorescence, turn on                                           the photoactivatable switch and degrade the toxin.

Degrading Part
We intend to degrade toxins through E.coli system. When the                                       fluorescence intensity is higher than threshold, our device                                       will sense it and turn on the LED light. In our E.coli system,                                       N564 Fragment and C565 Fragment are expressed by the                                       constitutive promoter. Induced by LED light, N564 Fragment                                       and C565 Fragment will complex with each other. pT7 promoter                                       will be induced by the complex and then expresses ZHD101 and                                       TRI101 which respectively modifies ZEN and DON toxin,                                       modification will reduce their toxicity.
Figure 4 : Schematic diagram of the degrading part
The first part is a kind of photochemical reaction, N564 Fragment                                       and C565 Fragment are activated by light and react with each                                       other.
The reaction process can be described as following:
We can get some differential equations which describes the                                       process:
Simulation
We use Matlab to simulate the process.
Figure 5 : Simulation result
According to our simulation result, after about 36s, the photoactivatable switch will fully open, the complex reaching                                           the maximum number of molecules, 220 molecules.
The following part is a dynamic model, the complex activate                                           pT7 promoter and pT7 expresses ZHD101 and TRI101. The                                           reaction process can be described as following:
Simulation
We use Matlab to simulate the process.
Figure 6 : Simulation result
According to our simulation result, after 35 minutes, ZHD101                                       is fully produced and reaches the maximum number of molecules,                                       600 molecules. At the same time, 30 minutes later, TRI101                                       reaches the max, 500 molecules.
Sensitivity analysis
We briefly evaluate the sensitivity of the model by perturbing                                           the value of parameters. Changes of ±10% in β, COM, ξ, d1, d2,                                           sZHD, sTRI and k have different effects on the variable of ZEN                                           and TRI, as they are showed in Figure. We can see that changes                                           of ±10% in β, d1 and sZHD have a greater influence for the                                           variable ZEN, respectively, while the changes of d2 and sTRI affect                                           the variable TRI greatly. As indicated in Figure, the parameter                                           of COM has no effect on the results.

Kill Switch Part
In the final part, we design a kill switch to control our system’s                                           hazards to the environment. Without galactose induction to the system, TFs will not been expressed and BI-1 will not been                                           induced. So the concentration of Bax is much higher than BI-1,                                           the yeast will die.
Figure 8 : Schematic diagram of Kill Switch
Since Bax is expressed by a constitutive promoter, we can describe                                           it as following:
Simulation
We use Matlab to simulate the process.
Figure 9 : Simulation result
According to our simulation result, produced by a constitutive                                           promoter, Bax is fully expressed after 80 minuutes and it’s highest                                           molecule number is 380.
BI-1 is induced by TFs which is induced by galactose, we can                                           describe it as following:
Simulation
In different Galactose concentrations, the system will express                                           different concentrations of BI-1. We use MATLAB GUI to simulate                                           the process.
Figure 10 : Simulation result
You can adjust the Galactose concentration and observe the                                           change of BI-1’s concentration. If BI-1’s concentration is higher                                           than Bax which simulated before, the yeast will survive. From                                           the simulation result, we know if galactose’s concentration is                                           lower than 0.02g/ml, the yeast will die.
