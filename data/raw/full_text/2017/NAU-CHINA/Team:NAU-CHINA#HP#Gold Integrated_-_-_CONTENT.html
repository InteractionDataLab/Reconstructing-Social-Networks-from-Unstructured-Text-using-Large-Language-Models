He commented that he has suffered a great loss from FHB. In 2015, 40%~50% wheat in his field was affected with FHB. He uses chemical pesticide every year, but it doesn’t always work. It is necessary for him to purchase a new kind of chemical pesticide because plant pathogens were resistant to the original one.</P><P>This experience gave us the opportunity to explore the impact our project might have on society. They also assisted us in thinking about responsibility in science.</P><P> “safety is important”，it inspired us that “Got to talk more in depth with people who were interested”.</P><P class="dialog-emit">You can read about our interview script HERE!(<SPAN class="inte-under">Liu HE</SPAN>)</P></DIV><DIV class="dialog-on"><DIV class="close">X</DIV><P class="header">What did we discuss?</P><DIV><P class="title">1.Could you please tell us the incidence of wheat scab in recent years?</P><P>——last year (2016) continued raining and drizzling, as a result wheat scab is particularly serious, the incidence rate of infection is approximately 50% to 60%.</P><P>This year ( 2017 ) wheat grew particularly well, almost no wheat scab, the morbidity was less than one percent. You know, infected musty wheat contains vomitoxin. Taking the Huaihe River as the boundary, in the south of the Huaihe River, due to  Huainan climate mostly wet and humid, higher the  morbidity is, vomitoxin content is almost in 1500~1600ppm. Last year the situation is relatively more serious, the wheat vomitoxin content is about 7500ppm. While the EU criteria on the vomitoxin stipulate the vomitoxin should be less than 1000ppm.</P></DIV><DIV><P class="title">2. What is the cause of wheat scab disease?</P><P>——the incidence of wheat scab has a great relationship with weather,the growth of winter wheat cultivated in Jiangsu province depends on the next year April’s weather. Although China has an old poverb &quot;Man will conquer nature&quot;, but people engaged in farming industry will substantiate that people will never conquer the nature . The yield and morbidity of wheat  are sheer dependent on the weather . Once the wheat scab occurs , there is no other way back. </P></DIV><DIV><P class="title">3.What are the dominant ways to control wheat scab?</P><P>——Spraying pesticides in the blossoming stage of wheat. When wheats are about to blossom, we will spray pesticide on every single wheat we see. Another massive scale spray will be expected to  need  at the 10% to 15% of blossoming stage. During the entire growth cycle, we will have to control the times of pesticide utilization, generally it is no more than three times. However wheat scab can only be prevented, it can not be cured. Once it happens in the field, there is no other way back. Like the human skin, once the skin is damaged, the bacteria will arrive and reproduce immediately.</P></DIV><DIV><P class="title">4.Will wheat scab be resistant to the usage of pesticides?</P><P>——Unfortunately yes, thus every year pesticide will be renovated and replaced, pesticide researchers will also introduce new pesticides every year. A pesticide will be replaced and disappear for up to two years. Actually, pesticide used in field crop will be expected to need a renovation every year, even it is for killing weeds and Aphidoidea.</P></DIV><DIV><P class="title">5.How to deal with the infected wheat?</P><P>——Wheat with serious infection, the vomitoxin content is way higher than the criteria, it can not be made as food for human. However, they are more prone to be made into feed. The two toxins produced by the scab can be accumulated in the food chain . As a farmer who cultivate wheat , I am also very concerned about the problem of mycotoxins in food. It now appears that there is a great potential that excessive mycotoxins may be in the food, these food flows into the market circulation,  the crippling hazard to the  human body  accumulate gradually. If you do not pay attention, the adverse consequence may occur in the near future.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section-categories-item section-categories-interview"><DIV class="section-categories-title">

Unfortunately, it is undeniable that, in the context of unfavorable climate condition,  the bottom will fall out of the quality as the content of toxins will be definitely above the stipulated value.</P><P>We also visited the quality-control laboratory of the government in which we found that it was such a both labor-consuming and time-consuming process to detect the two toxins. Basically, the government will need 3-4 days to finish a set of detection. Besides, the devices they utilize are expensive and inconvenient.

It does trigger a serious economy descending  not only for big companies but also for individual farmers, so I believe FHB to be a tough and tricky disease for agricultural.</P><DIV class="title"><P>2.What do you think the public and the farmers would react to our genetically-modified yeast as a measure for precaution in the soil? Would they accept it? </P></DIV><P>——Well, in China it could arouse unrest. Because the public haven’t been exposed to this kind of genetically modified method before. Also, you know, the people may conjure up the fear of a former issue, a heatedly debated legislation through the last decade, whether we should allow genetically modified food circulating in the market. So, I guess it wouldn’t be very sought-after.</P><DIV class="title"><P> 3.Is there any foreseeable problems that may come along with the utilization of genetically modified yeasts? </P><P>——Well, you should be very aware that perhaps this method which inoculate genetically modified yeasts into the soil may not work out… I know quite a few researches carried out by professors with great prestige. It took them years to isolate microorganisms that could to some extent control diseases of wheat, however when they inoculated them back in the soil the problem showed up—some plants got sick and then recovered, others didn’t… It’s complicated.</P></DIV><DIV class="title"><P>4.What are the common ways to detect the two toxins, DON and ZEN? Is it time- consuming ?</P></DIV><P>——It usually takes us  3-4 days to get the final results. Basically, as soon as we got the samples. We would firstly process the samples, and then we sent these samples to  be tested by HPLC(High performance liquid chromatography). This device is complex and expensive. Few institute can afford that. </P><DIV class="title"><P>4.Could you tell us the rough content of two toxins that circulate in the food chain?</P></DIV><P>——It’s hard to say. The content of toxins is climate dependent. For example, in 2015, the content was way higher than the standard. According to the law, the content of DON in wheat should lower than 1000ug/kg, and ZEN should lower than 60 ug/kg.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="section-categories-item section-categories-handbook"><DIV class="section-categories-title">

                                                            FHB is caused by a range of Fusarium fungi, which infects the heads of the crops when they are growing in the field. The disease is often associated with contamination by mycotoxins produced by the fungi which can cause severe economic losses .

                                                            According to literature review, we know that FHB is responsible for significant grain yield reduction world-wide. In China, wheat scabs affected areas are about 7.5 million hectares, accounting for the 1/4 of the total area of wheat. The annual loss of damage caused by scabs is about 2 million to 3 million Ton.In the U.S and Canada, Fusarium ear blight emerged in the 1990s as a widespread and powerful threat to cereal production.[1] From 1998-2000 the Midwestern United States suffered $2.7 billion in losses following a FEB epidemic.

                                                            Fusarium toxins have negative effects on the immune, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems of animals.[2]DON is a protein synthesis inhibitor, which also called vomitoxin, due to its negative effects on feed intake in pigs. Pigs are the most sensitive to DON, while ruminant animals such as cattle have higher tolerance.[3]Many countries monitor Fusarium mycotoxins in grain to limit negative health effects. In the U.S there are advisory levels for DON in human food and livestock feed.[4]The European Unionhas legislative limits for several Fusarium mycotoxins in grain aimed for human consumption[5]and recommended limits for animal feed.[6]Extensive research has been put into the development of control measures of Fusarium ear blight. Scientists, growers and food processors aim to develop effective control measures, including the reduction of mycotoxins.

So they can get a feedback as soon as possible. Third, we want to introduce the biological control to the public.

And some consumers(63.99%) have no idea about the situation of FHB. Some reasons for t having no appropriate approach to the information. Besides,Most consumers(74.94%) express their need to learn about the FHB and its damage,inculding36.25% o have a strong need.

Over a half of the  respondents express they know few about wheat scab.We set an interference option about aflatoxin. But we find people have a more clear recognition of it  for 38.44% of the respondents can choose the right answer about the toxin FHB brings. Besides we set a feedback to all respondents after the respondents finishing the questionnaire. We hope they can know a little more from the questionnaire.

                                                                To summarize, though the results of the survey may be a bit partial and incomplete to some extent due to the small sample size, it is undeniable that people's knowledge about wheat scb is insufficient. Especially after we have learned consumers have a high request on the quality of food, we consider it is important to know the wheat scab and toxins involved.
