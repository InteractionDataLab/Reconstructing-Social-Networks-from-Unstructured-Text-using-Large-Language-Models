Dr. Zhang Haoqian’s talk
During brainstorming，we invited Dr. Zhang Haoqian to give                                 a speech and other iGEM teams (CPU-CHINA, AHUT-CHINA, NJU-CHINA, NANJING-CHINA) to exchange the ideas. Dr. Zhang Haoqian shared his experience and give us some advice.
Teaching Mathematical modelling
to the freshman
We invited Zhang Peihong a team member of NAU-CHINA 2                                 016 to give a brief introduction about mathematical modelling.
Aims of modelling:
1、Useful for informing the design and analysis of complex biological experiments
2、Intergrating knowledge and experimental data and making testable predictions about the behaviour of complex biological systems
SB 7.0 The Seventh International
Meeting on Synthetic Biology
Our team leader participated in SB 7.0 conference in Singapore.
The goal of SB7.0 is to unite again international synthetic biology communities to take a fresh look at the key topics and                                 challenges that the field faces. 
She communicated with Abigail Sison about some problems                                 our team meted during the time of funding,recruiting, brains                                 torming.
Some topics delivered by IGEM Foundation members :
IGEM safety committee works with IGEM participants to strengthen safe .This year ,our team paid more attention to biosafety and performed safety checks on Registry parts and the                                 organisms carefully.
WeChat propaganda
Through WeChat platform ,we give detail explanation to the                                     public about IGEM  and some excellent projects about synthetic biology .
Short talk about “what is microbe?”
Through WeChat platform ,we give detail explanation to the                                         public about IGEM  and some excellent projects about synthetic biology .
Farming
November is about when China began planting winter wheat, On October 30, we went to the Baima base of Nanjing Agricultural University, where we planted wheat with farmers.
Weibo
Microblogging University Media Union of Jiangsu China reported our “nightlife”.
Data collection
From experts ,through interviewing and emailing,we gathered information and data on the Fusarium head blight from experts to assist us with modeling and machine learning.
From government
We went to Taizhou government where we visited two officers. They provides some pictures and reports on the incidence of Fusarium graminearum in recent five years. We know that the resistance of Fusarium graminearum to carbendazim                                                 was increased by using single drug every year different wheat varieties have different prevalence rate.
Questionnaire
we chose  Internet survey method among scientists, researchers, common students and general public to collect information of theirs opinions. We also prepared some questions about biosafety during the exchange.
