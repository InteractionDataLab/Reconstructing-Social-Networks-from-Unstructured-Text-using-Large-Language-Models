Introduction
The main goal of our project in the short-term was to develop and test recombinase parts in E. coli. To the best                 of our knowledge, these parts have not been extensively tested for activity and orthogonality in bacterial                 cells. The parts listed below have all been functionally verified, and can be used to construct the systems                 described on our design page [link]. We report verified function in four tyrosine recombinases, none of which                 have been correctly documented by any iGEM team before. We also report target sites for each recombinase,                 none of which have been properly documented or entered into the registry before. We have also developed a                 collection of orthogonal Cre-recognised Lox sites. Finally, we have developed measurement constructs for                 each recombinase. We used these constructs to measure and confirm the activity of our basic parts.
Basic parts
Our basic parts fall into three categories: Recombinase generators, recombinase target sites, and orthogonal                 target sites for Cre. We selected the recombinases Dre [1], Vika [2], VCre, and SCre [3] to form the basis                 of our toolkit. These recombinases were shown to not cross-react with the Cre/LoxP system [1][2][3][5], and,                 in the case of VCre and SCre [3], were claimed to not cross-react with one another. As part of our toolkit,                 we also included the associated target sites for these recombinase generators. For a snapshot of how we verified                 the function of these parts, scroll down to the “Demonstrate” section of this page. For a more detailed view,                 click on the parts registry link, which will take you to the detailed analysis of each individual part. We                 also included in the toolkit orthogonal target sites for Cre recombinase. Cre/LoxP is a very popular recombinase                 system that is frequently used in biotechnology [4]. In order to expand the potential of this system, we                 have developed multiple mutant Lox target sites, which have previously been identified as sites that will                 not react with the classic LoxP site [4]. Adding these mutant, orthogonal lox sites to the toolkits means                 we provide a framework whereby one Cre protein could catalyse up to ten distinct recombination events within                 one cell. Once again, check out the full registry pages for each part to learn more and download their individual                 sequences. To simplify our experimental workflows, we have also developed an inducible Cre recombinase generator,                 also reported below.

Composite parts
Our generators use our novel T7-LacO promoter composite. This allows for inducible expression of our parts in                 E. coli strains expressing T7 Polymerase. As is elaborated on the improve section of this page, this constitutes                 a valuable part improvement. Finally, we assembled measurement constructs. These consisted of two target                 sites flanking a promoter, with this part inserted in between the promoter and RBS of the BBa_J04450 part.                 As explained in the diagram below, these constructs could test if two target sites would recombine when a                 particular recombinase was present in the cell. This allowed us to demonstrate our recombinase target sites,                 recombinase coding sequences, and novel promoter functioned as anticipated. Furthermore, they allowed for                 us to demonstrate which target sites for different recombinases would not recombine with one another. It                 should be noted we did observe some unexpected cross-reactivity. In a sense, this is a positive, as it verifies                 the validity of our measurement construct for testing if two recombinase sites are orthogonal. Indeed, it                 appears our measurement constructs are more sensitive than those reported in the literature, as cross reactivity                 for SCre and VCre had not previously been observed [3].
Fig. 1: Basic schematic demonstrating principle of our recombinase measurement constructs. Parallel lines                     (or capacitor for engineers) represents transcription terminator downstream of a promoter. Triangles                     of identical colours represent target sites that can recombine with one another. Different coloured triangles                     are incompatible target sites. Note that RFP reporter gives off quantitative output, so recombination                     efficiency between two sites can also be quantified.

Silver Medal Criteria: New Parts
Our team most straightforwardly satisfies this requirement with our recombinase generators for Dre, Vika, Vlox,                 and SCre. Other teams have claimed to have developed generators before. However, none with the sequences                 we have used have been submitted and none have been documented at all. Therefore, these recombinase coding                 sequences should be recognised as new parts: there are no parts with the design, sequences, or function of                 our new coding sequence parts. As demonstrated by the data on each parts registry page, each has been sequence                 confirmed and demonstrated to function via our measurement constructs. A “snapshot” of the data you can find                 on the registry page is shown below. Below are the results of the assays involving Dre recombinase. As demonstrated                 by the Rox-Term-Rox measurement construct, Dre recognises and causes recombination between Rox sites, as                 very high RFP fluorescence was observed. Conversely, negligible fluorescence was observed in all other measurement                 constructs, demonstrating the orthogonal nature of the Dre/Rox system.
Gold Medal Criteria: Improve a Previous Part
Our team has created functional variants of the basic lox part and vastly improved the documentation of the individual                 recombinase target sites (Rox, Vox, Vlox, and Slox). This all counts as part improvement. The simplest, easiest                 to demonstrate improvement is our new T7-LacO promoter, though. Previous attempts have been made to create                 this inducible T7 promoter. However, none have been previously documented to work on the registry. Furthermore,                 our part has subtle sequence differences to previous parts, although it is unclear if this is the reason                 for the function of our promoter, as there is no data regarding previous attempts to make this part. Therefore,                 our part represents an improvement on parts BBa_R0184, BBa_R0185, BBa_R0186, and BBa_R0187. Documentation                 on the parts registry page demonstrates the function of our promoter. The utility of the part is demonstrated                 by its ability to decrease leakiness through a two-tiered repression system, illustrated below.
Fig. 2: T7 Polymerase is under control of standard Lac promoter. The Gene of interest is under the control                     of T7 Polymerase promoter that is repressed by LacI. Therefore, incubation with IPTG will cause T7 polymerase                     to be produced and repression to be removed from the gene of interest’s promoter. This is less leaky                     than a standard induction system. That is because, for there to be leaky production of the gene of interest,                     first, there must be a “leak” at the Lac Promoter. Then, there must be a subsequent “leak” at the T7-LacO                     promoter. Therefore, this is less likely to occur than a solitary “leak” from a normal LacO-based promoter.
Part collection
Our part collection consists of all of the basic and composite parts listed above. Our team is very proud of                 the number of parts we have successfully assembled and functionally verified. For this reason, and the reasons                 outlined below, we feel we qualify for the Best Part Collection special prize. Our parts are all well-characterised,                 verified to work, and have all of this information strongly documented on the iGEM registry. These parts                 form the backbone of our toolkit, and are intended to be used together, as the exciting possibilities of                 using multiple orthogonal recombinases in concert is what inspired us to choose to develop our toolkit and                 part collection in the first place. Our parts are all ready to use, and can readily be assembled into other,                 new, exciting constructs simply by using parts on the registry. Our team has demonstrated the capacity to                 build more complex systems using these parts, demonstrated best by our measurement constructs. Each measurement                 construct required two recombinase target sites to be integrated into the BBa_J04450 and for the cells to                 also be transformed with a recombinase generator. Therefore, we demonstrated that our parts collection can                 be used to assemble higher-order constructs. Finally, the documentation of our parts is complete with information                 on each recombinase’s registry page that denotes which other parts it is suitable to use with. Therefore,                 other teams will be able to take advantage of our parts and documentation to develop their own unique projects.
