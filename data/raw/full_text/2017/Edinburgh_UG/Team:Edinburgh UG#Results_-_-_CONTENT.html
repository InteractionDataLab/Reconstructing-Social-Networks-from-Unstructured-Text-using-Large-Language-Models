In the experiment, linear oligo containing a complete target site and miniprep containing the identical target site are mixed together with cell lysate (+) or water (-).
 In the lanes with cell lysate (+), a smear can be seen, indicating that recombination occurred between miniprep to form concatamer. However, one can also see a brighter band within the smear, indicating that recombination has occurred between the linear oligo and the circular plasmid, thus linearizing the plasmid.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H2 class="header-subsection"> Quantitative measurement of recombinase activity </H2><P>  
                We have co-transformed both of our T7-LacO-recombinase generator and our measurement construct into E. coli BL21 (DE3). These strains are then incubated with or without IPTG, on either LB plate over 48 hours, or in LB media in plate reader. We have thoroughly characterized the recombination efficiency of the five recombinases, and determined what combinations are the most orthogonal pairs for future applications. To access all of the raw data for the measurements we carried out, and the basic statistical parameters we calculated, e.g. standard error, download the Excel file below.

                We have determined that Dre/Rox recombinase is likely the most efficient SSR in E. coli, and that it is orthogonal to the rest of the recombinases. However, we also observed that the SCre/VCre and VCre/Vika pairs would cross-react with one another. As a result, we do not suggest using either pair to catalyse parallel recombination events in one cell. Therefore, we recommend using Dre, Cre, SCre, and Vika for parallel reactions in E. coli, as all four listed will have minimal interference with one another.
