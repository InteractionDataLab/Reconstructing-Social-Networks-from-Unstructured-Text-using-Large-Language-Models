                (area of study) [1-2]. It is different from “multidisciplinary”, where people from different disciplines
                work for the same goal, but do not communicate or exchange ideas. </P><P> Interdisciplinarity is believed to facilitate creative breakthroughs and provide new perspectives [1]. For example,
                drug discovery has benefitted from both chemistry and biology, by integrating knowledge from both areas [3].
            </P><P> We also discovered interdisciplinarity in SMORE. Our cell sorter is a fusion of biology, engineering and design,
                made by our biologist and product designer. This made us think: how important is interdiciplinarity in synthetic
                biology? Can we make synthetic biology more interdisciplinary, to facilitate creativity and innovation? </P><P> Our human practices start by exploring interdisciplinarity in synthetic biology. We conducted a skill exchange
                survey to find out the challenges in interdisciplinary collaboration. To study the interdisciplinary status
                of synthetic biology, we asked if more diverse teams perform better in iGEM? The results of both were thought-provoking,
                leading to our work in accessibility. </P><H2 class="header-subsection"> Skill Exchange Survey </H2><P> We began our investigation into interdisciplinarity with a simple question: how beneficial and difficult is it
                to work with someone from another background? In a skill exchange survey administered to our team and our
                iGEM collaborators, we developed a series of questions targeted to members involved in a “skill exchange”.
                We defined “skill exchange” as an event where one member taught another in an area previously untrained for
                the latter. For example, one of our biologist brought our product designer into the lab for training in basic
                protocols, including miniprep and agarose gel electrophoresis. </P><P> Overall, trainees were surprisingly positive about the learning experience. While they would often appear uneasy
                when approaching with unfamiliar work, they often reported the communication with the trainer was straightforward,
                and the trainer’s expectations were reasonable. </P><P> Particularly, a well-defined protocol has been identified to greatly help the trainee. The protocol provides
                clear and consistent terminology for both parties, and it gave a reference that the trainee can depend on,
                especially when they forget a task or technical terms. The trainers also reported the protocol aided them
                to perform demonstrations, which allowed the trainee to follow in a logical and precise manner. </P><P> Another aspect that the participants reported as beneficial was previous cooperation experience. While it may
                seem obvious, the results clearly pointed out when both parties were already friends or past collaborators,
                they find communication easier. In other words, practice makes perfect. Even if communication is initially
                difficult, it is worthwhile to continuously ironing out the kinks. </P><P> Nonetheless, as the survey identified, difficulties in collaboration remain. A common theme was that communication
                became difficult when too many technical terms were used by the trainer. Naturally, every discipline develops
                jargon. And despite the reported attempts of trainer to minimise their use of technical language, trainees
                still frequently complained that it hindered their understanding. Therefore, it is likely interdisciplinary
                collaborators were already aware of the drawback of technical language, but it should still be consciously
                and deliberately controlled. </P><P> Interestingly, there was a disconnect between trainer and trainee not before, but after the skill exchange. The
                last question of our survey asked both parties if the trainee can repeat the work independently. In every
                questionnaire, the answer from the trainer, with varying amounts of added qualifications, was positive. However,
                every trainee reported they would feel uncomfortable without guidance. Therefore, our questionnaire highlighted
                a disconnect in confidence. To illustrate, an experienced biologist deemed miniprep trivial, but every non-biologist
                that was taught in miniprep reported they liked further assistance to master the process. </P><P> Therefore, it is crucial to be reminded communication and collaboration are not one-time events. Instead, experts
                should consider them a long-term endeavour that requires multiple sessions before learners can fully impart
                the skill and knowledge. </P><P> Links: </P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/2/2b/T--Edinburgh_UG--interdisciplinarity_survey_bulgaria.pdf" style="font-size: 20px"> [Skill exchange surveys from Bulgaria] </A><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/a/ab/T--Edinburgh_UG--interdisciplinarity_survey_edinburgh.pdf" style="font-size: 20px"> [Link for Skill exchange surveys from Edinburgh] </A><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/d/d2/T--Edinburgh_UG--interdisciplinarity_survey_israel.pdf" style="font-size: 20px"> [Link for Skill exchange surveys from Israel] </A><H2 class="header-subsection"> Systematic Review of Previous iGEM Teams </H2><P> Given interdisciplinarity is thought to benefit academic research, investigated the status of interdiciplinarity
                in synthetic biology, more specifically, in iGEM. iGEM is open to students from all disciplines and is
                interdisciplinary by nature. For example, human practices and modelling represent social sciences and mathematical
                sciences, respectively. Moreover, iGEM indirectly qualifies projects in terms of medals and prizes, providing
                a model system to measure the benefit of interdiciplinarity. </P><P> To measure the interdisciplinarity of past iGEM teams, we recorded the discipline of each iGEM participant from
                2013 to 2015. It is noteworthy that a diversity in disciplines does not always imply interdisciplinarity.
                Even in a diverse team, members may not exchange in skills or closely cooperate. But, diversity is a close
                and practical measure. The measurement of interdiciplinarity is correlated to their tracks, and medals to
                observe the relationship between interdisciplinarity and performance in iGEM. </P><H2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;"> Measurement of Interdisciplinarity </H2><P> Interestingly, the measure of interdiciplinarity is a product of interdisciplinarity itself. Diversity of disciplines
                is analogous to biodiversity, which ecologists have been studying. Here, we use an ecology-inspired interdisciplinarity
                index: Rao-Stirling index, to quantify the following aspects of interdiciplinarity [4]: </P><UL style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-size: 17px;"><LI><STRONG> Variety: </STRONG> how many different disciplines are within each iGEM team?</LI><LI><STRONG> Balance: </STRONG> are participants of each discipline of similar proportions? </LI><LI><STRONG> Disparity: </STRONG> how different are the disciplines in the iGEM team? E.g. the difference between
                    linguistics and synthetic biology is far greater than that between cell biology and synthetic biology.
                </LI></UL><P>We chose the Rao-Stirling index due to its incorporation of all three aspects and its well-known uses in social
                sciences [5-6]. Moreover, Rao-Stirling index, similar to its ecological counterpart Rao’s quadratic entropy,
                behave mathematically in a fashion closely resembling the human intuition of diversity [7]. For example,
                the index is very sensitive to the addition of a highly different discipline and an increase in overall range
                of values covered.</P><P style="text-align: center;">Rao-Stirling Index: $$D = \sum _{ij,i \neq j} d_{ij}p_{i}p_{j}$$</P><P>where $D$ is the interdisciplinarity measure. $p_i$ and $p_j$ are proportions of discipline $i$ and discipline $j$ in the
                team, respectively. $d_{ij}$ is the difference between discipline $i$ and discipline $j$, measured in Euclidean distances.
                (Note: some versions of Rao-Stirling Index include parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ [6]. But, they are inapplicable
                to this study and are not discussed here.)</P><P>The measurement of disparity ($d_{ij}$) is less straightforward than variety $(i, j)$ and balance $(p_i, p_j)$. We devised
                a simple framework based on the Biglan's Axes, a well-established categorisation of disciplines, to semi-quantify
                each discipline in the following three qualities [8]:</P><UL style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; font-size: 17px;"><LI><STRONG> Foundational – Applicational: </STRONG> is the knowledge gained of pure academic interest (e.g.
                    philosophy), or of applicational value outside academia (e.g. software engineering)?</LI><LI><STRONG> Hard - soft: </STRONG> if a paradigm exists to be followed (e.g. engineering) or if qualitative
                    discussion is the only requirement (e.g. philosophy)? </LI><LI><STRONG> Life - non-life:</STRONG> is the discipline concerned with living organisms (e.g. biology) or is
                    the discipline unconnected and unapplied directly to any living organisms (e.g. software engineering)?
                </LI></UL><P>We score each discipline from 1 to 7 for each of the three qualities. Euclidean distance $(d_{ij})$ is calculated
                by using the scores as three-dimensional coordinates. For example, a subject with scores 3, 6, 7 would have
                a coordinate (3, 6, 7) in a (x, y, z) format. We then used the data to calculate a diversity value for each
                team.
            </P><H2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;"> Data Collection and Analysis </H2><P>It should be noted that we have collected and analysed the data in the following way: </P><UL style="list-style-type: disc; color: black; font-size: 17px;"><LI>iGEM teams with an ambiguous or incomplete record on disciplines of team members were excluded from the analysis</LI><LI>iGEM teams that received a blocked medal were excluded from the analysis, as a blocked medal does not correlate
                    with the quality of the project</LI><LI>Datasets from different years were analysed separately, as the award criteria were not consistent throughout
                    2013-2015
                </LI></UL><P>We respect the achievements of every iGEM team and we promise that the sole purpose of the collection of data
                was to understand interdisciplinarity in synthetic biology. Data was collected from publicly available iGEM
                team websites. </P><H2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;"> Results </H2><P>Distribution of discipline diversity is grouped by medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze and None; Figure 1). Disappointingly,
                no significant difference in interdisciplinarity was detected between medal winners in any year (p &gt; 0.1
                for all combinations; ANOVA).</P><FIGURE style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;"><FIGCAPTION style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> distribution of interdisciplinarity measure grouped by iGEM medals. Whiskers represent
                    the range of values. Box indicates median and interquartile range (25th and 75th percentile).</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>This was surprising as the interdisciplinary that benefitted on our team was not reflected in the data. Why is
                that? Here are some possibilities:</P><UL style="list-style-image: none; list-style-type: disc; color: black; font-size: 17px;"><LI>While interdisciplinary may theoretically facilitate innovation and skill exchange, practical difficulties in communication and cooperation remain a great obstacle, as reflected from the skill exchange survey. The benefits were offset by poor integration of a diverse skillset.</LI><LI>A diversity in discipline fails to capture the exchange of skill and knowledge within the cooperation – the essence of interdisciplinarity. </LI><LI>iGEM is an interdisciplinary competition with a core of synthetic biology. Thus, a focus in biologists and engineers in team composition is often required for most tracks in iGEM. The optimal interdisciplinarity was a balance, rather than a complete diversity.
                </LI></UL><P>These results were thought-provoking, as we expected the potential of interdisciplinarity can be fully realised in iGEM. This expresses a dire need to improve the integration of interdisciplinarity in iGEM.</P><P>How can we better promote diversity and innovation in iGEM? We went back to our skill exchange survey to address the problems of interdisciplinary collaboration. We start by making SMORE a tool accessible to researchers from all backgrounds and disciplines, encouraging an influx of perspectives and ideas. </P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh_UG/HP/Accessibility" style="font-size: 20px;"> Take a look at how we did this on the Accessibility page. </A><P>Below are the codes for the interdisciplinarity analysis. The code is written in iPython, which needs special software for viewing. We have provided a guide on viewing and working with our iPhyton code. We also provided the text in .txt file but please note the content may have changed. Similarly, we have included the data of past iGEM teams in an excel file. Finally, we have also included a word document where scores along each Biglan Axis are defined. </P><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/7/71/T--Edinburgh_UG--hp_zip.zip" style="font-size: 17px;"> Our iPython code for the analysis</A><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/9/9e/T--Edinburgh_UG--jupyter_instructions.pdf" style="font-size: 17px;"> Our guide to work with iPython </A><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/3/31/T--Edinburgh_UG--diversity.txt" style="font-size: 17px;"> Our code for the analysis in .txt. file</A><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/f/fd/T--Edinburgh_UG--interdisciplinarity2.xlsx" style="font-size: 17px;"> Excel Data for the analysis </A><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/4/4e/T--Edinburgh_UG--Biglan_Axes_Definitions.docx" style="font-size: 17px;"> Definitions of Biglan Axes scores </A><H1 style="font-size: 60px; text-align: center; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;"> References </H1><P> [1] Klein, J.T. 1990.
