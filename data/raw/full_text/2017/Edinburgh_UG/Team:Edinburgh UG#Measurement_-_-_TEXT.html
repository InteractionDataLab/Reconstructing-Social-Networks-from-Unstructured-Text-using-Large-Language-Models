Background
As a standardized toolkit for site-specific recombination, SMORE complies with the principle of biobrick and                 synthetic biology, emphasizing on accurate and repeatable measurements of our parts. This is why we have                 developed simple protocols and specific biobricks to quantify the activity of recombination, in terms of                 both efficiency and orthogonality.
This protocol involves i) transferring the recombinase generator from pSB1C3 to pSB4K5; ii) transformation of                 T7 polymerase expressing E. coli strain with recombinase generator in pSB4K5; iii) make competent cells out                 of the recombinase-carrying E. coli; and iv) transformation of recombinase-carrying E. coli with the appropriate                 measurement device. The entire experiment takes 7 days.

If the users do not have miniprepped DNA of pSB4K5 backbone, transform E. coli DH5α with it as well, and plate on LB agar                     with kanamycin.
Incubate all the LB agar plates with transformants overnight at 37ºC.
Day 2:
Inoculate the twenty transformed parts (pSB4K5 too if done) with 5 mL LB broth with chloramphenicol. Shake                     at 220 rpm, 37ºC overnight (16 – 18 hours)
Day 3:
Miniprep the twenty parts (pSB4K5 too if done) using the miniprep kit.
Reserve the fifteen measurement devices for later use. For the inducible recombinase generator, mix its miniprep                     with the miniprep of pSB4K5, and perform restriction digest and heat inactivation with EcoRI and SpeI                     according to the recommendation by supplier.
Add T4 DNA ligase and its buffer to the heat-inactivated reaction mix (make sure that the T4 DNA ligase is                     not incompatible with the previous buffer). Incubate according to the supplier’s recommendation.
Transform the ligated products (a total of five, one for each recombinases) into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Plate                     on LB agar with kanamycin.

Day 5:
Inoculate 100 mL of LB broth + kanamycin with 1 mL of overnight culture. Shake at 220 rpm, 37ºC for approximately                     2 hours, or until the OD600 reaches 0.3 – 0.6 (absorbance at 600 nm).
Transfer the culture to two 50mL falcon tubes and leave on ice for 30 minutes.
Transfer at least 150 mL of 0.1M MgCl2 and 150 mL of 0.1M CaCl2 onto ice.
Prepare 20 mL of CaCl2/Glycerol solution by mixing 17mL of 0.1M CaCl2 with 3mL of 100% glycerol.

Day 7:
Inoculate a colony from each of the transformation into 5 mL of LB broth + chloramphenicol and kanamycin                     in the morning.
*With only 96 wells in each plate, it is recommended to split the 25 transformations                     into several experiments, inoculate only a portion of the transformants each time.
When the OD600 reaches 0.3 – 0.6, dilute the cultures with LB broth + chloramphenicol and kanamycin until                     all the cultures have similar OD600, between 0.1 – 0.2.
Aliquot 100 μL of the diluted cultures into the 96-well plates. Reserve a column for loading the blank (LB                     Broth with chloramphenicol and kanamycin, without any E. coli). To half of the cultures, add 0.5 μL of                     0.1M IPTG to reach a final concentration of about 500 μM.
Seal the 96-well plate and put into the plate reader. Measure the RFP fluorescence intensity every 30 minutes                     over 48 hours with the following conditions:
Excitation: 584 nm
Emission: 610 nm
Shaking frequency: 300 rpm
Shaking mode: double orbital
Incubation temperature: 37ºC
Results
Results are summarized below. We have obtained quantitative results regarding the cross-reactivity of our four                 recombinases: Dre, Vika, VCre, and SCre. Our devices detected some unexpected cross-reactivity. For example,                 VCre and SCre were shown to recognize one another’s target site. Below is a “heat map” of every recombinases                 activity with respect to every measurement device tested. Note grey corresponds to constructs that were not tested due to time constraints. Also included is a graph demonstrating observed                 fluorescence output over time for every single measurement taken by our team.

Discussion
The results show that are measurement constructs function and are able to detect cross-reactivity between two                 recombinases. Indeed, observed sensitivity of our devices was so high that we demonstrated significant cross-reactivity                 between SCre and VCre, two recombinases originally reported as orthogonal [1]. Furthermore, we demonstrate                 that there is minimal cross-reactivity between Dre [2], Vika [3], and Cre, indicating that these recombinases                 can be used to catalyse distinct recombination events within one cell.
Our measurement protocol is also very repeatable. Any team wishing to carry out their own measurement using our                 parts could simply order the relevant parts from the registry and follow our above protocol. Also, the principle                 behind these measurement devices is useful for other projects. For example, if another team wanted to utilize                 Gin and Tn3 invertases [4][5] in one cell, they would be wise to first test if the two systems were orthogonal.                 They could achieve this by following our design plan and our wet-lab protocol. Our project would simplify                 the process of designing constructs through our web-based support tool: our oligo designer. Our recombinase                 target sites could be tricky to design because they contain repetitive sequences that cannot be chemically                 synthesized.
In conclusion, we have developed a robust tool for assessing recombinase activity. Our measurement devices provided                 invaluable insight into our own project by distinguishing which of our recombinases were orthogonal and which                 would cross-react. The devices we have produced are valuable to the iGEM community as a whole due to our                 detailed protocol, submission of standardized measurement devices, generalizable platform, and web-based                 support for designing elements of the devices.
