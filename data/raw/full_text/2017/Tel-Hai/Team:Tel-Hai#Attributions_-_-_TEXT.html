The participation of team Tel-Hai in the iGEM competition is an initiative brought forth solely by the student body. Last year was the first time a team from Tel-Hai college was created, after several students advocated for it and gained the support of the administration. The project was run mostly by the students, from concept of fund raising, project design to securing a host lab. Every aspect was under the students' responsibility, even the professional help we received was with accordance with the students' lead. We are proud to continue this trailblazing tradition, in solidifying an ongoing presence in the competition.
Funding
First and foremost, none of this would be possible without the sponsorship and financial support of:
Israeli Ministry of science, for funding the lion's share of our project.
Mr. David Friedman for recognizing the importance of the project and offering generous financial contributions, to both last year's team and us.
MIGAL Research Institute, for usage of lab space, equipment and facilities.
IDT offering all iGEM teams free 20k bp gblocks synthesis.
A special thanks goes out to Mr. & Mrs. Amit and Orit Shelef, for significant assistance with fundraising and crowd sourcing.
