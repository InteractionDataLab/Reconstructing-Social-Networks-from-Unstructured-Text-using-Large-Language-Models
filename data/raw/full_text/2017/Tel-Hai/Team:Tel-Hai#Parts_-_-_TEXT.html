Parts
Our three favorite parts containing the different versions of the KP6 toxin:
BBa_K2408020 - ADH1_KP6_proToxin: The toxin KP6 from the fungi U.maydis punched the outer membrane of B. bruxellensis and thus cause cell death. KP6 is translated as a protoxin and is then cleaved by protease into 2 subunits, alpha and beta. We have designed the part with the alpha MF secretion signal,  ADH1 promoter, terminator and a histidine tag.
BBa_K2408021 - ADH1_KP6_alphaSubunit: The KP6 toxin’s alpha subunit, which is cleaved by protease from the KP6 protoxin ( BBa_K2408020 ). This sequence also contains the MF(ALPHA)1 secretion signal,  ADH1 promoter, terminator and a 6 His tag.
BBa_K2408022 - ADH1_KP6_betaSubunit: The KP6 toxin’s beta subunit, which is cleaved by protease from the KP6 protoxin ( BBa_K2408020 ). This sequence also contains the MF(ALPHA)1 secretion signal, ADH1 promoter, terminator and a 6 His tag.
Here are the parts we have created over our lab work. All our parts have been optimized to suit the yeast we worked with, Sacharomyces cerevisae.
