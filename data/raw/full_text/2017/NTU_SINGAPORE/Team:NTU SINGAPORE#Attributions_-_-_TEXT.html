Collaboration
SIMTech
Human Practice Support
SIMTech (A*Star) kindly printed for us the 3D models needed for our human practice project.
GIS
Lab Support
GIS (A*Star) provided us with essential equipments such as FACS machine.
one-north Festival
Human Practice Support
one-north festival organisers provided us with a platform to reach out to the public.
Ooi Kean Hean
Project Support
Kean Hean has been a great support for the iGEM team guiding the team in both the project and creating the wiki page.
Norfala-Aliah
Advisor
Norfala made sure that the lab equipments required for our project are available. We are very grateful for her help throghout the course of the competition as she eased our journey.
Ivy Liu
Instructor
Ivy taught our team essential lab techniques required for our project. Her kind disposition makes her very approachable whenever we needed advice or help related to our project. She inspires us to excel in the field of research.
Wang Yuan Ming
Instructor
Yuan Ming never failed to help our team whenever needed. He was very approachable and we learnt a lot about scientific research fom him.
Asst Prof Tan Meng How
Principle Investigator
Asst Prof Tan Meng How closely guided us in our iGEM journey. He is a dedicated professor who keeps track of his students' progress via regular iGEM meetings. The meetings allowed us to raise our concerns and uncertainities related to our project.
SCBE NTU
Sponsor
We would like to tremendously thank the School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering (SCBE) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) for sponsoring us financial support, without which this project wouldn't have run smoothly.
Attributions
Our contributions to the project.
Kelvin
Leader
Kelvin has been contributing to the Rad52 project by regularly maintaining HEK293FT cell lines and conducting experiments such as transfection, flow cytometry, and InterLab measurement. He was responsible for organizing our workshop (to fulfil human practice criteria), and settling administrative matters
Danny Teo
Project Lead
Danny is in charge of Project Truncation, working with HEK293FT cells for flow cytometry and FACS. In addition to extensive wet lab work, he carried out analysis on crystal structure information. He was involved in designing and performing experiments for collaborations and integrated human practices.
Dam Linh Chi
Project Lead
Lin Chi has taken part in the therapeutics (EGFR) project by maintaining multiple cell lines like A549, PC9 and H3255. FACS and T7E assays have also been part of her regular work in the NTU iGEM team.
Jaclyn Lee
Project Support
Jaclyn started working on the therapeutics (EGFR) project in September 2016 as her undergraduate research project and continued working on it for iGEM. She has worked on multiple techniques like plasmid cloning and transfection in the PC9 cell line.
