Fourth International InterLab Measurement Study
 
 
This year Inter-lab Measurement Study aims to establish a GFP measurement protocol based on engineering principles for testing six RBS devices (BCDs) that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable  in labs around the world.
Team DEIAGRA had followed the plate reader protocol for this study as mentioned on ( https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/8/85/InterLab_2017_Plate_Reader_Protocol.pdf ) for obtaining the data represented below in form of graphs.
