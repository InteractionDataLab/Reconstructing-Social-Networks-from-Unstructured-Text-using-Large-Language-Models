PROJECT DESCRIPTION
WATER IS SOUL OF UNIVERSE, A SOUL THAT FILLS LIFE,LOVE AND HOPE IN THIS WORLD; A SOUL WHICH HAS EVENTUALLY FADED INTO DARK CORNERS; A SOUL WHICH IS NOW CRYING FOR ENLIGHTMENT; A SOUL WHICH NEEDS AWAKEMENT WITHIN ALL OF US.
It is not just a molecule of oxygen and hydrogen, it is plethora of emotions and every day struggle.
“Commodity for some,
  A 3km walk for another.
  Amusement for some….
 Struggle for another.
 Fountain for some,
  Just a drop for another.
 Swimming for some
 Drought death for another”
 
So water the essential requisite of nature, within which life originates and evolve ,has now been completely intoxicated anddestroyed by varied human activities and practices.
We human in this metamorphism of evolution, have devastatingly affected this natural lineage and now the biggest problem posed by these un-regulated, and un-monitored human activities is release of heavy metal as waste product in water–bodies,as industrial discharge.Which increases concentration of these metals beyond permissible limits.
Thus ,heavy metals(trace metals) becomes one of the most persistent pollutants in wastewater. The discharge of high amounts of heavy metals into water bodies leads to several environmental and health impacts,like –
·        Death of aquatic life
·        Destruction from sedimentation
·        Algal  blooms
·        Habitat destruction
 
SOURCES OF VARIOUS HEAVY METALS-
HEAVY METAL
SOURCES
Arsenic(As)
·         Pesticides, fungicides, metal smelters
Mercury(Hg)
·         Pesticides, batteries, paper industries
Chromium(Cr)
·         Mining, electroplating, textile tannery industries

·         Paints, pesticides, batteries, automobile emission,   mining, burning of coal
Cadmium(Cd)
·         Welding ,electroplating, pesticides, fertilizers,   batteries,
Nuclear fission plants
Nickel(Ni)
·         Electroplating, zinc base casting, battery   industries
Maganese(Mn)
·         Welding, fuel addition, ferromanganese production
Copper(Cu)
·         Electroplating, pesticides, mining
Zinc(Zn)
·         Refineries, metal paintings, immersion of painted   idols
 
Biological remediation processes (microbial remediation and phytoremediation) are indicated to be very effective in the treatment of heavy metal pollutants in wastewater.  The expression of metal-binding proteins or peptides in microorganisms and plants in order to enhance heavy metal accumulation and/or tolerance has great potential. Several different peptides and proteins have been explored. The overexpression of metal binding proteins has been widely exploited to increase the metal binding capacity, tolerance or accumulation of bacteria and plants.
So , we as “ TEAM DEI” are working in direction to reclaim this polluted water , by preparing a bio-chip(overexpression of metal binding protein),which removes heavy metal toxicity from industrial effluents,thereby making this water re-usable for  activities like agriculture practices,sanitation purposes,and drinking; hence the project titled-:
“ Biochip for removing heavy metal toxicity from industrial effluents “
The overexpression of metal binding proteins has been widely exploited to increase the metal binding capacity, tolerance or accumulation of bacteria and plants. An expression level of transgene/gene of interest depends upon strength of promoter. Architecture of these promoter elements can be redesign for modifying the gene expression. The basic rationale behind developing such modified promoters lies in the notion that the transfer of the upstream DNA sequence/cis-element that binds a specific trans-factor from one promoter into a different promoter containing the TATA sequence might result in a novel regulatory or transcription model. Hereby in our project we are focusing on overexpressing the Top-4 metal binder protein (iGEM part BBa¬_K1478002) by custom synthesizing strong promoter suitable for expression in microbes and plants. In our previous studies strong promoters had been developed. We would also fabricate a bio-chip by immobilizing those bacteria strongly expressing Top-4 metal binder protein (iGEM part BBa¬_K1478002) for fast, easy and user handy purification of industrial waste water which can be further usable for irrigation purpose.
