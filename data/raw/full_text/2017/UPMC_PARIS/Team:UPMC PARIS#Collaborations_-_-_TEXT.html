Collaborations
Collaboration between teams has been an important part of our project. Indeed, the data sharing and the joint work are not only necessary in this competition but more generally in the scientific field.  So, we were lucky to collaborate with different teams around the world. We have discussed about our projects and about collaborative work on common themes. The exchanges and discussions were mostly done during meetings, through e-mail and skype session.
Collaboration with Evry-Paris Saclay Team
We invited Evry-Paris Saclay iGEM team to join us to share with the pupils their knowledge, their lab skills and their vision of iGEM experience. Thus, we collaborated with two members of their team. Rose attended the practical class with us (1st session). She was very patient with the pupils and helped us in the long process preparation of the material and solutions on the day of the class. Yanis was here for the 2nd session (Interpretation of results, introduction to synthetic biology, Presentation of iGEM competition and our projects, overview of biology at university). He has an actual pedagogical talent and the pupils immediately appreciated him. This was a great illustration for the kids that scientific research is based on collaboration and team work.  We also collaborated on another side of the Human Practices: law. We met Evry team’s jurist, Maxime de la Fouchardière and we had the opportunity to ask our question and learn a lot about intellectual property and legal issues. He gave us an extensive view on the legal process regarding the authorization of use for human drugs and cattle oriented therapeutics. finally he gaved us insight on the legal issues regarding the use of GMO in Europe and the potential consquences of the widespread of one of these organism in the wild.  Thank you very much Evry-Paris Saclay, we really had a smashing time working with you.
Collaboration with Team Harvard
Harvard team had the idea to gather ethical, academic and political issues concerning projects of 6 teams: Harvard, Linkoping, AQA_Unesp, Aalto-Helsinki, Hamburg and ours. Indeed all the teams’ projects have relevance to biomanufacturing and to creating  biologically synthesized useful substances at a commercial scale. Thus, gathering perspectives from people involved in these fields will enable us to better understand our subject as it is complex and controversial. To do so, they created a document where the 5 teams could add their questions, complete others issues and add their opinion. From all these questions, they created a Global Perspective Outreach survey that we shared on our Facebook page. Finally, we were sent the collected data which we used for our Human Practices.

Collaboration with Team Dusseldorf-Köln
Both our teams met at the meet-up organized by Delft team in Delft in The Netherland. We talked together about our projects and realized they had something in common: they both include an optogenetic system. After that we kept being in touch through e-mails and skype sessions.  As our project went on, we had a hard time finding a way to emit the specific wave length we needed. Therefore, we asked Düsselforf-Köhln team for help and asked them how they managed to do it. They generously gave us the schematics for 3D-printing their lightning box so that we could 3D print our lightning system.
