Acknowledgments
The UPMC-Paris 2017 Team would like to sincerely thank everyone that has been involved with our project since its inception, contributing to its eventual completion. Throughout each step of the process we’ve been lucky to have had amazing support and guidance.
Firstly, our special gratitude goes for our amazing supervisors Pr Marco Da Costa and Pr Frédérique Péronnet: their help was more than precious from all point of view!
Secondly, we would like to thank Dr. Alexis Génin , head of the Research And Technology Development Office, Dr. Julien Elric , the Startup Manager at iPEPS, and all the administration and support services at Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle Epinière (ICM) for hosting the iGEM UPMC-Paris 2017 team.
Our sponsors
Our sincerest thanks to everyone who helped to fund our project. Without their support nothing of what we have achieved would have been possible.
Le fonds de solidarité et de développement des initiatives étudiantes (FSDIE):
The Pierre and Marie Currie University's Solidarity and Student Initiatives Development Fund (FSDIE) provided us financial support for the realization of our project. Our Major financial support was carried out by them. Our sincere thanks to Mr. Emmanuelle Body and his colleagues who have been involved to support this project.
Direction of the UFR 927 - "Faculty of Biology at Pierre and Marie Curie University":
Financial contributions were made by the Faculty of Biology at Pierre and Marie Curie University. Special thanks to our wonderful supervisors Pr Marco Da Costa and Pr Frédérique Péronnet who had made this connection allowing us to obtain this fund and also thanks to Julienne Diamant-Martinet, Financial manager of the Faculty of Biology at UPMC (Sorbonne University).
Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle Epinière
The vectorology core facility of Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle Epinière (ICM) provided us lab space and many of the everyday materials that we required. In addition, we were continually aided and guided by lab members and researchers at the institute on a day-to-day basis.
Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Pierre and Marie Curie University
The Pierre and Marie Curie University; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology provided matching funds for our project, and provided us with lab space to work for interlab study.

We have received a fund from the CFA formation thanks to to motivated students willing to help our student majoring in Computer Science.
IDT
IDT synthesized all our DNA parts for us and were very quick and helpful in answering all our questions about their DNA synthesis process.
Snapgene
Snapgene allows iGEM teams free access to their software we found invaluable in assembling, our parts in silico and well as explaining them to others.
New England Biolabs
New England Biolabs kindly provided the restriction, polymerase and ligase enzymes and buffers that we needed to assemble of DNA parts.
Our generous crowdfunders
We raised money through crowdfunding "Ulule" and "You're Be" which we used for registration fee of Giant Jamboree.
Professional advice

Labwork and Other Support
Our advisors: Nassim Ledoux and Wilhelm Vaysse-Zinkhöfer, they have contributed a lot since day one.
Our mentor: Thomas Jaisser, for his support and recommandation!
Alumni from the Biology Department have been very supportive over the last two years when UPMC has been represented at the iGEM competition for the first time. Their input, in kind and financially, as well as listening to our presentations at various events and providing feedback, has been most generous and provided us with much encouragement.
We want to thank all of the people (Camille, Imene, Maxime, Jude, Armand, Hamidou, Priscilla, and Milene) who helped us whenever we needed to complete our lab work. We couldn't have done it without you!
Thanks to all the journalists from Le Parisien, UMPC Press, Valenton City Press, and lastly Bagneux city Journal Press.
