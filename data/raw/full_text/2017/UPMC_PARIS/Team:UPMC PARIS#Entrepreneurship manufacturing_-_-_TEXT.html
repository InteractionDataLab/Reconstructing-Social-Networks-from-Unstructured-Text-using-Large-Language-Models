Days after days, the recombinant proteins production is growing as a vital industrial science, in major fields of work such as healthcare or agronomy. Optimization of this production, that to says reducing the cost and time of production of these molecules, is the main priorty of companies of this sector. Another major challenge remain to further automatize these processes.
When we started the project our main goal was to find a solution that could help to resolve the issues of the lack of access to proper healthcare in developing contries. To do so, we investigated the causes of the healthcare failures in different regions of the world that leads to a lower life span compared to developed countries. Beyond a lack of basal hygienic prevention in an environment often favourable to the growth of various pathogenic agents, the lack of access to healthcare appeared as an obvious source of this lower quality of health.
Through our box, we focused more specifically on the lack of access to preventive and curative protein drugs. We want to innovate in the way we produce already existing therapeutic molecules.
We then focused on 3 main causes of the lack of access to drugs in the world :
1) The lack of financial means for the purchase and setting up of drug production
2) Geographical isolation of the countries concerned
3) Storage and transport of drugs issues
Strategic Business Unit (SBU)
In order to have a more general view of the drug market, we have set up a SBU table around the question of the lack of access to         healthcare.
