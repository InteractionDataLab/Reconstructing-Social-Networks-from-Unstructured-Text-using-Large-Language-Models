The social problem of red tide
Red tide is a natural phenomenon that is correlated to changes in the temperature, salinity, nutrient levels, etc., that produce an explosive microalgae proliferation. In case of red tide, the algal bloom it's caused by a few dinoflagellates that produce toxins. This microalgae are eaten by fish, causing their death, and there are filtered by bivalves. If a human consume a bivalve with toxins, well…it depends of the toxin, but if you encounter a Saxitoxin (paralyzing type) you could die.
Last year, the red tide caused problems to the local people like health problems, economic problems and social problems. This is because extraction of marine products is one of the more important economic activities of the zone.  In July we went to Chiloé and Puerto Montt, we talked with the people and we asked about this problem last year and its consequence. You can find our journey below!.
As we talked with the people through an interview model, we also asked for suggestions about our device as a solution to a better detection of red tide toxins. Coming up next, we have our model to our interview. As you can see, there are four different models of it: To mayors, labor unions, fishermen and bussiness
The interview
To mayors
Also we have our travel log, document were is available an analysis of our interview, with some answers of interest (we are going to discuss that here, don't worry). You can find it here!
