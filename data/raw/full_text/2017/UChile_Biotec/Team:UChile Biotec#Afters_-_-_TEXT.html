Improvements
We would like to recall the improvement made to a part previously submitted by the Heidelberg team in 2015 ( BBa_K1614007 ),this functional DNA is capable of forming a G-quadruplex. Upon incorporation of hemin, a chemiluminescent reaction can be performed we improved this part by incoporing it in our own molecular device. It was conjugated with an aptamer that escifically binds itself to STX, this was possible via a DNA sequence called "Linker"
This part was not only improved but it is also a central part of our project!
