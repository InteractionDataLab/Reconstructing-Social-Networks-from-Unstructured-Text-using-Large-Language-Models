                Antibiotic resistant bacteria is an increasing global problem and will affect every aspect of daily life
                - from medical treatment to food production. iGEM NTNU Trondheim wanted to raise awareness and share
                knowledge about phage therapy as a potential solution to antibiotics through lectures, article in GENialt,
                Researcher's night and social media.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_img_left"><H1 style="margin-left: 45% !important; width: 55% !important;">Lecture at the Medicine and Health Library</H1><DIV class="image" style="width: 35%;margin-top: -6em"><P>Jenny with stuffed bacteria.</P></DIV><P>
                We had a lecture at the Medicine and Health Library about our project. In advance, the communication
                advisor, Anja Johansen, had put up an mini exhibition about resistant bacteria and bacteriophages,
                which included literature, poster about iGEM and the team, and &quot;giant bacteria&quot; (stuffed animals).
                Through the presentation we were able to inform people about antibiotic resistant bacteria, bacteriophages
                and the concept of &quot;Phage age&quot;. After the talk people were free to ask questions or just talk to us. A
                dermatologist was so impressed by our project, and asked us kindly to take a picture and post it on Twitter.

                We held a presentation at the Department of Biotechnology and Food Science, where professors, researchers
                and PhD-students were present. There was an interesting discussion afterwards, with many good questions
                from the audience.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><H1>Researcher's night</H1><P>
                Researcher's night is arranged each year since 2005 at NTNU and attracts more than 1200 high school
                students. It aims to present reseach, natural science and technology in an fun and interactive way with
                more than 30 stands and lectures. On Friday 29th of September we joined Researcher's night and conveyed
                our research by having different stand-activities, such as Kahoot (questions) about our project and
                synthetic biology. We used legobricks to explain how DNA editing works, and stuffed animals to illustrate
                how a virus attacks a bacterium. We also used small petri dishes containing dessert gel, to explain how
                we grow bacteria in the lab. The most exciting part with this was that the students could eat the gel,
                which made them curious and wanted to hear more about us. All in all, it was a great night with engaged
                and interested teenagers.

                Marianna was interviwed in GEN<I>i</I>alt, the journal published by the Norwegian Biotechnology advisory board,
                about our project and iGEM. GEN<I>i</I>alt focuses on ethical and social aspects on the application of modern
                biotechnology.
                
                The interview can be found <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/6/60/T--NTNU_Trondheim--GENialt_article.pdf" target="_blank">here</A> (in Norwegian).

                Social media is an easy way to connect with people outside the scientific community. Through Facebook,
                Instagram and Twitter we shared our failures and successes, and people got to know the NTNU Trondheim team.
                Social media were also an important platform to promote our sponsors for their attribution.

                        The iGEM NTNU 2017 Facebook page gained more than 260 likes. Below is a screen shot of our
                        Facebook page and a selection of pictures shared during the summer.

                        On instagram we shared 54 posts with more than 180 followers, where the majority was iGEM teams
                        from all over the world. This was a great way to interact with other iGEM teams. Below is a screen
                        shot of our instagram account.

                        We inherited the Twitter account from previously iGEM NTNU teams. On twitter we had more than 350 followers that we shared our progress with. Twitter gave us the opportunity to follow companies, scientists and other iGEM teams. Below is a screenshot of our Twitter page.
