                A major challenge for phage therapy is the <I>high host specificity of phages</I>. A phage that is capable of
                killing one bacterial infection will not automatically be capable of killing another similar bacterial
                infection. In terms of safety and side effects, this is a good thing, as bacteriophages targeted towards
                harmful bacteria would not be capable of harming the cells or beneficial bacterial flora of the patient.
                However, in the case of a serious bacterial infection, it is obviously crucial for the patient to get the
                medicine in time to recover safely and well.
                
                We were eager to try to counter this challenge. <I>For our project, we therefore aimed to develop a method
                of evolving phages capable of infecting a targeted bacterial strain that they were previously not able
                to infect.</I> This method needed to be able to quickly producing tailored phages, keeping us one step
                ahead of the resistant bacteria. Our project can be divided into 3 parts.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><H1>1) Collecting, isolating and purifying phages</H1><P>
                Phages are plentiful in nature and exists wherever bacteria are found. By taking environmental samples
                from a wastewater treatment plant, we collected a broad range of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages capable
                of infecting and killing <I>Escherichia coli</I> DH5α were amplified by mixing the environmental water
                samples with growth medium and inocculating the mixture with <I>E. coli</I> DH5α.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_img_left"><DIV class="image" style="width: 30%;margin-top: 0em"><P>Plaques of phages grown on <I>Escherichia coli</I> DH5α. First run.</P></DIV><P style="width: 65% !important; margin: auto 15% auto auto !important;">
                The bacteriophages were purified by sentrifugation and filtering, and isolated by adding purified phage
                mix to growing <I>E. coli</I> DH5α and plating them on agar plates. The bacteriophages could be seen as plaques
                (empty spots with no bacterial growth) that was cut out of the agar and stored. In this way we got
                bacteriophages capable of infecting a given bacterial strain, <I>E. coli</I> DH5α.
                
                See <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NTNU_Trondheim/Experiments">protocols</A> for a detailed description of the isolation and purification process.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><H1>2) Evolving a bacteriophage capable of infecting target bacteria</H1><P>
                In order to evolve bacteriophages capable of infecting target bacteria, we needed a controlled environment
                that favoured phages capable of infecting target bacteria. We built a bacterium/bacteriophage control
                system consisting of 3 coupled chemostats and two connected containers for medium (see figure).
                Photosensors capable of measuring real-time concentration of bacteria and phages in the out-flow were
                constructed. For a description of the hardware we built from scratch, see <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:NTNU_Trondheim/Hardware">hardware</A>.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="dropdown_paragraph"><DIV class="slidedown_button"><P class="show_more">Show more</P><P class="show_less">Show less</P></DIV><DIV class="dropdown_text"><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><P>
                        We had to set up a controlled environment that favoured phages capable of infecting some chosen
                        target bacteria. In order to do this we first had to evolve phage host bacteria so that they could
                        become resistant towards the phages. These were used as the target bacteria. The process was done
                        in a single chemostat: When phages and bacteria are mixed, this creates an evolutionary pressure
                        for the bacteria to develop resistance towards the phage, and those capable of developing this
                        resistance will survive in the chemostat.
                        
                        Once having one bacterial strain resistant towards the phage (target bacteria), and one bacterial
                        strain non-resistant towards the phage (acting as phage hosts), we could proceed in the triple
                        chemostat system (see figure):
                    </P></DIV><DIV class="image" style="width: 50%;margin-top: 5em"><P>Illustration of chemostat setup.</P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><P>
                        Medium from two separate containers was pumped into two separate chemostats, chemostat 1 and 2.
                        Chemostat 1 contained the host bacteria (not phage resistant) and chemostat 2 contained the
                        target bacteria (phage resistant). The contents of chemostats 1 and 2 were further pumped into
                        chemostat 3 and mixed there. The bacteriophages were also pumped into chemostat 3. Phages,
                        bacteria and medium was continously pumped out of chemostat 3 and measured to control the
                        bacterial concentration.
                        
                        The reason for this set-up was to be able to continously provide the bacteriophages
                        with new hosts from chemostat 1, giving them a chance to evolve and overcome the resistance
                        of the target bacteria pumped from chemostat 2. If not provided with available hosts, there
                        was a risk that the bacteriophages would get flushed out of the chemostat because they didn’t
                        evolve fast enough to be able to infect the target bacteria. With our set-up, this problem was
                        avoided, so that the phages could continue infecting and replicating within the host bacteria and
                        simultaneously evolving until they were also capable of infecting the resistant bacteria.

                Since our platform relies on mutation/evolution of bacteria, it is useful to accelerate the natural
                mutation rate of the bacteria. We therefore contributed with a new biobrick, MP6, which is an inducible
                plasmid that can be transformed into <I>E. coli</I> and increase the mutation rate of the bacteria. The mutational
                activity is induced in the presence of Arabinose, and repressed in the presence of Glucose, making it
                possible to turn the transcription of the mutagenesis inducing proteins on and off.
