Safety
Safety have been an important part of our project. This includes safety with respect to ourselves, colleagues                 and the environment. In our project we have been working closely with bacteriophages. Extra care have                 therefore been made to prevent contamination of other bacterial cultures in lab and spread of the virus.
Safe Project Design
Safety is important in our project design. At NTNU we have tools and guidelines to help us create a                 safe working environment in the lab.
In our project, we are only working with non-pathogenic chassis, that is, E. coli of the strain DH5α and                 bacteriophages (phages) that target this strain. DH5α is competent cells that are used in general                 cloning. Genetically modified  DH5α cells were never taken out of the lab. Phages are natural predators of bacteria, and do not target                 humans, animals or plants. Because phages target bacteria, we are careful to wash and clean the lab                 benches and equipment, which have been in contact with phages, with sodium hypochlorite, and use safe                 storage to store the phages (tubes with screw cap). The parts BBa_K325909 (bronze) and BBa_K2265000                 (silver) that were chosen to work with, promoters, terminators and  other regulatory sequences were of                 low risk to humans, because they were found in prokaryotes. The project does not involve other chemicals or                 factors that are of risk to humans or the environment. Overall, we are convinced that our project is safe                 to work with as long as we are carefully follow the safety rules and regulations.
Safe Lab Work
Prior to the lab work, we had an introduction to the lab, use of equipment, different bench areas, and                 waste treatment by the Health, Safety and Environment instructor at the department of Biotechnology and                 Food Science. We also filled out Risk assessment forms that made us aware of the different safety                 measures corresponding to the different lab activities. We worked in a safety level 2 lab, but only needed                 equipment for safety level 1. The phages were therefore kept away from the work spaces of other researchers.                 DH5α is in risk group 1 and do not cause any harm to humans.
In the lab, it is mandatory to wear a cotton coat to limit contamination of genetically modified                 organisms, and of course protect yourself. Other than a cotton coat it is important to wear safety                 goggles in the restricted areas, for instance, in the gel lab and in the fume hood where we handle                 hazardous chemicals (chloroform). Nitrile gloves were used for all lab work, and vinyl gloves could also                 be used to protect the sample, but they do not give the same protection as nitrile gloves. The lab benches                 were washed with 70 % ethanol to prevent bacterial contamination, while sodium hypochlorite removes                 bacteriophages.  70 % ethanol was used to clean the sterile fume hood, together with UV-light. As a good                 habit, we regularly washed our hands, especially after working with bacteria. When taking out equipment                 or big containers from the autoclave we used thermal-resistant gloves and eye protection. As a basic                 rule we were not allowed to consume food or beverages in the lab.
