Antibiotics resistance â€“ a big, global challenge
Antibiotic resistance is poised to become one of the greatest dangers of our time. Since its discovery                 in 1928, antibiotics have been our first line of defense against bacterial infections. Antibiotics have                 saved countless lives, and made difficult and complex surgeries possible [1]. For half a century we have                 enjoyed the golden age of antibiotics where we have had no reason to fear bacterial infections. But this                 golden age is coming to an end. Widespread misuse of antibiotics, coupled with minimal investment in new                 treatments have allowed pathogenic bacteria to develop resistances to many antibiotics. Our best defense                 against the bacteria have now created one of our greatest medical threats. [2]

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) have confirmed that the United States and the                         rest of the world are amid an emerging crisis of antibiotic resistance for microbial pathogens                         [2]. In 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that antibiotic resistance is one of the                         biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. [3]
As antibiotics are losing their effect, invasive surgeries such as organ transplants, joint replacements and cardiac surgeries will become difficult and expensive. People undergoing                         chemotherapy or taking any immunosuppressants will be in a lot more danger of contracting                         deadly infections. An increasing number of infections, such as pneumonia, gonorrhea and                         tuberculosis, are becoming difficult to treat because the antibiotics previously used are                         starting to become less effective [3]. The threat of antibiotic resistance has led to policies                         for restrictive use of antibiotics, but many countries have already given up the battle against                         certain antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus),                         common in hospitals. If these policies fail, the need for an alternative will be vital.

Bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics
Fortunately, antibiotics are not the only natural enemies of bacteria. Bacteriophages, or phages for                 short, are tiny, bacteria-specific viruses capable of infecting selected bacteria while leaving other                 bacteria, as well as animal and plant cells, unharmed. They are one of the most widespread biological                 units in the biosphere, and exist anywhere bacteria can be found, for instance in soil, water and animal                 intestines. In nature there is a continuous battle between phages and bacteria, with the consequence                 that for every bacterium there probably exists one bacteriophage capable of killing it. Bacteriophages                 might therefore be an interesting topic to look into in the search for alternatives to antibiotics.

The bacteriophages were discovered in the beginning of the 20th century, and scientists early                         suggested using them to counter bacterial infections. With the discovery of antibiotics, however,                         scientists in the Western world lost the interest in bacteriophages, and the research on phages                         was primarily conducted in the Soviet union, especially in what is now the country of Georgia.                         During the second world war, Soviet soldiers used bacteriophages as treatment for infections,                         and there still exists a phage therapy center in Tbilisi, Georgia today [4]. Phage therapy had                         a bad reputation for a long time, mostly because of poor documentation and research methods,                         but currently, under the threat of antibiotic resistance, the interest in bacteriophages is                         rising once again.[5]
Phage therapy does however have several issues to be ironed out before becoming a mainstream                         medical treatment.[5] One major stumbling block for phage therapy is the high host specificity                         of phages. Most phages can only infect certain strains of a bacterial species. This creates the                         need for either large libraries of potential phages, or a quick method of developing a phage                         capable of fighting a given bacterial infection. In order to solve this problem, our project                         attempts to investigate the latter method.
