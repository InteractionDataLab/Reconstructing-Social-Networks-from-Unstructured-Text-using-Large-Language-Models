Project Phage Age
Team NTNU Trondheim 2017 is a team of 8 students from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology                 (NTNU) participating in the iGEM Competition : the world’s biggest student                 team competition in synthetic biology. We are glad to present Project Phage Age!
With our project we aim to face the approaching challenge of antibiotics resistance by taking a                 closer look into the exciting area of phage-therapy. We have developed a platform for evolving                 bacteriophages into killing specific, target bacteria that were previously resistant towards the phage.                 As bacterial antibiotics resistance mechanisms does not affect bacteriophages, we believe that this                 approach can be a promising contribution in the quest for battling multi-antibioticresistant bacterial                 infections.

Thank you!
We would like to thank all our sponsors without which we would never have been able to complete our                 project. They have made very important economic contributions, and have also showed both interest and                 support. Special thanks go to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) that supplied                 us with supervisors, as well as providing us with our own lab space and basic equipment. At last we                 would like to thank everyone who helped and supported our project so that we were able to finish it                 and present it at the Giant Jamboree in Boston in November 2017.
