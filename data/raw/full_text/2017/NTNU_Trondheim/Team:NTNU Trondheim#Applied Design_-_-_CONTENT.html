                The core goal of our project is to develop a strategy that would solve the problem of bacterial
                resistance to antibiotics once and for all. Our reasoning goes like this: while small molecules
                used as antibiotics cannot be easily evolved to overcome bacterial resistance when it occurs,
                bacteriophage can very much be evolved. Thus phage-based treatments could tackle the issue of
                resistance by a constant evolution of the treatment agent (phage) in line with bacteria. The most
                intriguing case would be if one could evolve an anti-phage against a bacterium from a patient in
                a sufficiently short time to cure the patient with the new phage! We therefore made a chemostat-based
                evolution system that generates a diversity of phage, selecting them on their ability to infect
                phage-resistant bacteria, and made a biobrick that could increase their rate of mutation.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="dropdown_paragraph"><DIV class="slidedown_button"><P class="show_more">Show more</P><P class="show_less">Show less</P></DIV><DIV class="dropdown_text"><DIV class="image" style="width: 50%;margin-top: 5em"><P>A chematic of the workings of the phage evolution system.</P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><P>
                        The chemostat based evolution system consists of 3 chemostats. In the first, phage host bacteria
                        are grown – these bacteria can be infected by the phage to be evolved. They are used to generate
                        phage diversity and can host a mutagenic plasmid in order to make the diversity even greater.
                        In the second chemostat resistant bacteria are grown on their own. The outputs from these two
                        chemostats bring the host and resistant bacteria into a third chemostat where they mix together.
                        The third chemostat also contains phage that are to be evolved. Neither of the input bacteria
                        are subject to evolutionary pressure within their own chemostats. This and the  high volume
                        exchange rate inside this chemostat prevents phage-bacteria competitive ecosystems from evolving.
                        If bacterial resistance to phage evolves in this chemostat, the resistant bacteria will get
                        washed out and will not affect the evolution of phage.

                We used our chemostat system in different modes to first evolve a phage-resistant E.coli and then evolve
                a phage to kill it within 13 hours of evolution. (See the results section for further details). This
                showed that it is practical to perform fast phage evolution given a resistant bacterium. As compared
                to the rate of invention of new antibiotics this is of course a lot faster. However it is also easier
                for bacteria to evolve against phage than against antibiotics. A possible solution could be phage cocktails
                or pluripotent phage. The phage mix that we evolved, for example, was able to kill both the original
                bacterium and the one that was resistant to the original phage. In any case the system for allowing
                new phage into the market would have to be more dynamic than that of antibiotic approval. This means
                that the long times and huge amounts of money that are necessary to approve a new medicine would likely
                need to be abolished in the case of phage. This will not happen unless legislative changes are introduced.
                
                However, as the prevalence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics increases, we think that more pressure
                will be put on the authorities to pursue such changes.
            </P></DIV><DIV class="paragraph_no_img"><H1>Environmental impact</H1><P>
                There are already orders of magnitude more phage than bacteria in nature. The competition between
                bacteria and phage has lasted billions of years neither biological form being able to extinguish
                the other. It is therefore unlikely that we would manage to generate a phage to kill all bacteria
                in the lab given the time scales and the copy numbers that we are working with. It is likely that
                common pathogenic bacteria will evolve resistance against the phage used in treatment, but then we
                are back to the same issue that we successfully addressed in our project – we will always be able to
                evolve an antiphage.
