Our project
A major challenge for phage therapy is the high host specificity of phages. A phage that is capable of                 killing one bacterial infection will not automatically be capable of killing another similar bacterial                 infection. In terms of safety and side effects, this is a good thing, as bacteriophages targeted towards                 harmful bacteria would not be capable of harming the cells or beneficial bacterial flora of the patient.                 However, in the case of a serious bacterial infection, it is obviously crucial for the patient to get the                 medicine in time to recover safely and well.
We were eager to try to counter this challenge. For our project, we therefore aimed to develop a method                 of evolving phages capable of infecting a targeted bacterial strain that they were previously not able                 to infect. This method needed to be able to quickly producing tailored phages, keeping us one step                 ahead of the resistant bacteria. Our project can be divided into 3 parts.
1) Collecting, isolating and purifying phages
Phages are plentiful in nature and exists wherever bacteria are found. By taking environmental samples                 from a wastewater treatment plant, we collected a broad range of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages capable                 of infecting and killing Escherichia coli DH5α were amplified by mixing the environmental water                 samples with growth medium and inocculating the mixture with E. coli DH5α.

The bacteriophages were purified by sentrifugation and filtering, and isolated by adding purified phage                 mix to growing E. coli DH5α and plating them on agar plates. The bacteriophages could be seen as plaques                 (empty spots with no bacterial growth) that was cut out of the agar and stored. In this way we got                 bacteriophages capable of infecting a given bacterial strain, E. coli DH5α.
See protocols for a detailed description of the isolation and purification process.
2) Evolving a bacteriophage capable of infecting target bacteria
In order to evolve bacteriophages capable of infecting target bacteria, we needed a controlled environment                 that favoured phages capable of infecting target bacteria. We built a bacterium/bacteriophage control                 system consisting of 3 coupled chemostats and two connected containers for medium (see figure).                 Photosensors capable of measuring real-time concentration of bacteria and phages in the out-flow were                 constructed. For a description of the hardware we built from scratch, see hardware .

We had to set up a controlled environment that favoured phages capable of infecting some chosen                         target bacteria. In order to do this we first had to evolve phage host bacteria so that they could                         become resistant towards the phages. These were used as the target bacteria. The process was done                         in a single chemostat: When phages and bacteria are mixed, this creates an evolutionary pressure                         for the bacteria to develop resistance towards the phage, and those capable of developing this                         resistance will survive in the chemostat.
Once having one bacterial strain resistant towards the phage (target bacteria), and one bacterial                         strain non-resistant towards the phage (acting as phage hosts), we could proceed in the triple                         chemostat system (see figure):
Illustration of chemostat setup.
Medium from two separate containers was pumped into two separate chemostats, chemostat 1 and 2.                         Chemostat 1 contained the host bacteria (not phage resistant) and chemostat 2 contained the                         target bacteria (phage resistant). The contents of chemostats 1 and 2 were further pumped into                         chemostat 3 and mixed there. The bacteriophages were also pumped into chemostat 3. Phages,                         bacteria and medium was continously pumped out of chemostat 3 and measured to control the                         bacterial concentration.
The reason for this set-up was to be able to continously provide the bacteriophages                         with new hosts from chemostat 1, giving them a chance to evolve and overcome the resistance                         of the target bacteria pumped from chemostat 2. If not provided with available hosts, there                         was a risk that the bacteriophages would get flushed out of the chemostat because they didn’t                         evolve fast enough to be able to infect the target bacteria. With our set-up, this problem was                         avoided, so that the phages could continue infecting and replicating within the host bacteria and                         simultaneously evolving until they were also capable of infecting the resistant bacteria.

3) Increase the mutation rate of bacteria
Since our platform relies on mutation/evolution of bacteria, it is useful to accelerate the natural                 mutation rate of the bacteria. We therefore contributed with a new biobrick, MP6, which is an inducible                 plasmid that can be transformed into E. coli and increase the mutation rate of the bacteria. The mutational                 activity is induced in the presence of Arabinose, and repressed in the presence of Glucose, making it                 possible to turn the transcription of the mutagenesis inducing proteins on and off.                 See parts and results for more details.
