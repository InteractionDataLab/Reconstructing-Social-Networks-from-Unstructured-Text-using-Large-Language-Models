Collaborations with SJTU
Both located in Shanghai, teams from ECUST and SJTU both take part in 2017 iGEM competition.
On July 30, we invited SJTU iGEM team to our school, visiting our laboratory and communicating with each other. Since this is the first time for our school to take part in iGEM competition, we have some problems on details such as project designing, modelling, human practice, whether the collaboration we carried out meet the requirements of iGEM, visa requirements, the Giant Jamboree and others, and as a university which has taken part in this competition for several years, SJTU gave us many valuable suggestions. They reminded us that LED light resource cannot provide full-spectrum emission peaks, and provided us with some advice on human practice and visa applying, which was of significant help for us.
On top of that, as part of control group of our experiments, SYFP2 (Part: BBa_K864100) was the part we need to optimize in our project. However, due to some improper operations in the process of transformation, the experiment failed and there was no sample left for us to carry out another experiment. At this time, SJTU helped us finish the transformation by providing some reagents in their kits, assisting us overcome the difficulty. In return, we also helped SJTU on crtI gene transformation.
The collaboration was a great success and we two teams have established a close relationship with each other.
