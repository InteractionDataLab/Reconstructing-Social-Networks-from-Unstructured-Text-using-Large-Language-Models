In this summer, several members of Light Harvester from ECUST also participated in the conference and made it a meaningful trip.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE class="pull-right"><P>On July 30, we invited SJTU iGEM team to our school, visiting our laboratory and communicating with each other. Since this is the first time for our school to take part in iGEM competition, we have some problems on details such as project designing, modelling, human practice, whether the collaboration we carried out meet the requirements of iGEM, visa requirements, the Giant Jamboree and others, and as a university which has taken part in this competition for several years, SJTU gave us many valuable suggestions. They reminded us that LED light resource cannot provide full-spectrum emission peaks, and provided us with some advice on human practice and visa applying, which was of significant help for us.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><DIV style="font-size:10px;"><P>We are at CCiC</P></DIV></CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><P>On the first day, we took several lectures delivered by researchers and professors. Ranging from previous iGEM competitions to synthetic biology, and from discussions on biosafety to imagination of future days, we gained much valuable information and felt synthetic biology a powerful tool to change our future.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE class="pull-right"><P>The next day, teams coming from different universities were given opportunities to present their projects, and after each presentation, audience could raise any questions as they like. Light Harvester gave their presentation on this day. On top of presentations, teams also put up their posters and introduced details of projects to other participants.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The next day was also the last day. On this day, a grand closing ceremony was held to celebrate its success and all participants were gathered together again to exchange their ideas on iGEM competition and synthetic biology, have free talks with each other and gain valuable suggestions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><DIV style="font-size:10px;"><P>Figure 1</P></DIV></CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The conference was a success, not only offering our access to speeches delivered by excellent professors and biologists, but we also had opportunities to communicate with members from other teams, to know about their projects and ideas, to make idealistic collisions happen, and furthermore, to explore the unknown of synthetic biology.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
