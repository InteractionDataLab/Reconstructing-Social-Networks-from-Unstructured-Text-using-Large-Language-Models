<partinfo>BBa_K2308003 short</partinfo>
This part is a coding gene of sYFP2 (super yellow fluorescent protein), and the codes are optimized for expression in Rhodobacter Sphaeroides.
This part is an improvement of part (<partinfo>BBa_K864100</partinfo>)

sYFP2(BBa_K2308003) is the key part in our experiment. It is used both for fusion expression (see BBa_K2308002) and inducible cytoplasm expression (combined with BBa_K2308016), and the host cell is Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.

In inducible cytoplasm expression experiment, we used part BBa_K2308016 to turn the Rhodobacter sphaedoides 2.4.1 into inducible strains, and IPTG was added （800 μM in final volume）when the OD700 of the strain was about 0.4（grown for about 24h）.

It is obvious that after the codon optimization, sYFP2 can be better expressed in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.
