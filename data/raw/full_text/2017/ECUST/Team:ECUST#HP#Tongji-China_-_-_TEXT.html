Tongji iGEM×Fablab Shanghai Open Night
Tongji-China
We were delighted to be invited to participate in the Tongji iGEM×Fablab Shanghai Open Night，and together with the igem team of SJTU-BioX-shanghai, Fundan_China, Shanghaitech,Tongji_China, and the residents of the community to carry out a unique interactive show.
On July 30, we invited SJTU iGEM team to our school, visiting our laboratory and communicating with each other. Since this is the first time for our school to take part in iGEM competition, we have some problems on details such as project designing, modelling, human practice, whether the collaboration we carried out meet the requirements of iGEM, visa requirements, the Giant Jamboree and others, and as a university which has taken part in this competition for several years, SJTU gave us many valuable suggestions. They reminded us that LED light resource cannot provide full-spectrum emission peaks, and provided us with some advice on human practice and visa applying, which was of significant help for us.
We strived to use the simplest language to present our subject, so that non-professionals could also understand what we were doing. Women in the community who hold children, young people, even small children were also our audience.
To make everyone participate in different projects displayed, there was Q&A part followed. we have increased the mutual understanding of diverse subjects.     on the one hand, we understood the limitations of our own problems and shortcomings, on the other hand , we had better understanding of the spirits of the iGEM competition which is interpreted by different school.
After the Open Night and we exchanged our ideas. We also set up a live webcast and gave LIVE to iGEM teams in other provinces.
