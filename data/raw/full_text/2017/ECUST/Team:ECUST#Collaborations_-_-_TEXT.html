While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.

Tongji-China
Late in August, Tongji University hosted a Community Open Night for iGEM teams in Shanghai, which was a workshop for us to communicate with each other. The night was a great success and gave the Shanghai teams a chance for collaboration and communication.

UNebraska-Lincoln survey
While surfing iGEM websites, we found there are various kinds of collaborations in Community Bulletin. The Lincoln survey from UNebraska caught our attention and we filled in it seriously, hoping to share our opinions and thoughts about greenhouse gas with UNebraska.
Düsseldorf-Köln: postcard campaign
This year, Düsseldorf-Köln launched a postcard exchange campaign.We were glad to  take part in this postcard campaign, during this time, we designed our own postcards and get the others from team Cologne-Duesseldorf. what made this campaign meaningful was that more people get involved, and more people know about us, about iGEM,and about synthetic biology.

Peking University
As one of the most excellent universities in China, Peking University always achieves outstanding results in iGEM competition. Early in this summer, we invited Haoqian Zhang from Peking University to deliver a lecture on synthetic biology and iGEM for our team members. He also gave us many valuable suggestions on our project.
