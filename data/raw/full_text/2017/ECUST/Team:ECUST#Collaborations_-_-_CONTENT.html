		While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!

Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable. </P></DIV><CENTER><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ECUST/HP/SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai">Click here to read more.</A></BUTTON></CENTER><DIV class="page-header"><H3 id="tables">Collaborations with SJTU</H3></DIV><DIV class="style1"><P>Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.</P></DIV><CENTER><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ECUST/HP/SJTU">Click here to read more.</A></BUTTON></CENTER><DIV class="page-header"><H3 id="tables">CCiC</H3></DIV><DIV class="style1"><P>This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
		Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.</P></DIV><CENTER><BUTTON type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ECUST/HP/CCiC">Click here to read more.</A></BUTTON></CENTER><DIV class="page-header"><H3 id="tables">Tongji-China</H3></DIV><DIV class="style1"><P>Late in August, Tongji University hosted a Community Open Night for iGEM teams in Shanghai, which was a workshop for us to communicate with each other.
