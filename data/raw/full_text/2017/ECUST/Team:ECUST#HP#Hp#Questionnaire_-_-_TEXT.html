questionnaire
Through the history of mankind, nearly every significant step in the progress of human civilization is accompanied with energy innovation. In order to collect opinions from public on energy crisis, we conducted a survey and gained some valuable information. According to the results, we could see that most respondents, who are undergraduates, had their own understanding on current situation of energy development and the serious of energy crisis. Most of respondents who had used products relating to new energy held the opinion that those products were of higher prices and sometimes unstable performance compared to those using traditional energy. Whatâ€™s more, the factors mainly hampering the development of new energy, in their opinion, consisted of high cost, inadequate government support and short of technology and professional talents. On top of what mentioned above, we also discovered that most respondents had optimistic attitudes towards the development of new energy potential. The whole questionnaire has been affiliated.
