Background
Background
All of the 2017 iGEM teams are invited and encouraged to participate in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. Our team took part in this study which aimed to standardize the measurements of fluorescence in different labs. The main task was to quantify expression of GFP in common, comparable or absolute units. In our case, we measured fluorescence using plate reader.
Overview
Overview
Fluorescence is widely used as a proxy for promoter activity by expressing fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite this is an indirect measurement, it provides a useful insight into expression levels and has significant advantage that it could be continuously monitored without disrupting cells.
First, we measured the standard curve by diluting supplied FITC. Using these standard curves alongside your own standard curve for FITC it is thus possible to transform your relative measurements of fluorescence into absolute measurements of GFP molecules.
After making the standard curve, we successfully transformed eight plasmids provided by Measurement Committee and do the cell measurement according to the protocol.

Discussion
Discussion
Compare (Device 1, Device 2, Device 3) or (Device 4, Device 5, Device 6)
  1. It is noticeable that the promoter of Device 1or4 is strongest followed by Device 2or5, Device3or6.
  2. E.coli transformed by Device 1 grew slowly due to the high expression of GFP while those transformed by other Devices has similar growth rate.
Compare (Device 1 and Device 4), (Device 2 and Device 5), (Device 3 and Device 6).
  RBS of Device 1,2,3 is stronger than those of Device 4,5,6.
