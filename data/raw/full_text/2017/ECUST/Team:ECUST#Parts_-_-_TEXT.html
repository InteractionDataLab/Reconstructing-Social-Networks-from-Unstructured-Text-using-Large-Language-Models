Improvements
Improvement of Part:BBa K864100
The reporter sYPF2 has been codon-optimized for Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 and it was successfully tested as a reporter in this chassis. We have made several measurements to show its fluorescence in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 as well its properties (Fluorescence excitation/emission spectrum).

Improvement of Part:BBa V1003
The regulator LacIq's coding sequences are submitted in part BBa_K2308016. In our project, we used this part with Part:BBa_K2308003 together to turn Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 into inducible strains and successfully induced the expression of sYFP2.

Key parts
BBa_K2308002
BBa_K2308002 is an important part in our experiment. It is composed of BBa_K2308006，BBa_K2308003 and BBa_K2308007. The function of this part is to carry out the homologous recombination on the genome of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.

BBa_K2308003
sYFP2(BBa_K2308003) is the key part in our experiment. It is used both for fusion expression (see BBa_K2308002) and inducible cytoplasm expression (combined with BBa_K2308016), and the host cell is Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1.
In inducible cytoplasm expression experiment, we used part BBa_K2308016 to turn the Rhodobacter sphaedoides 2.4.1 into inducible strains, and IPTG was added （800 μM in final volume）when the OD700 of the strain was about 0.4（grown for about 24h）.

BBa_K2308016
This part contains LacIq repressor, LacIq spacer, LacIq promotor and LacIq coding sequence and is used for Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1, cells with the device can carry out inducible expression of the target proteins.
In inducible cytoplasm expression experiment, we used part BBa_K2308016 to turn the Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 into inducible strains, and IPTG was added （800 μM in final volume）when the OD700 of the strain was about 0.4（grown for about 24h）.
