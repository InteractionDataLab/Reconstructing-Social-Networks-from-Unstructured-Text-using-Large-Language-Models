Gold Medal Criterion #2
Standard Tracks: Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other. This working part must be different from the part documented in bronze #4 and silver #1.
Special Tracks: Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create) and display your achievement on your wiki.
