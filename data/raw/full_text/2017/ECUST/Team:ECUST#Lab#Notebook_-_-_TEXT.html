We have built the team since March 29 this year, one of Team-ECUST Teams. There are initial seven people only, which then gradually expanded to 13 people, during 7 month.
We knew nothing at the beginning of the IGEM, through step-by-step understanding and pondering, in the efforts of the team members and with the help of teachers and seniors, we accomplished the whole project finally.
Here are our team memorabilia from our team building to the wiki freeze.
2017.3.29-2017.4.5
1、Team-ECUST was established, initially 12 students were divided into two teams, our team initial members included Weijie Chen, Yunpeng Dai, Ye Li, Yuyao Jin, Yuanyuan Li, Binjie zhang and Zhenzhou Jiang.
2、We made researches about previous iGEM teams, wondering who did what.

After the teachers' review, we determined that the primary direction was the photosynthesis of microorganisms.
2017.4.12-2017.4.19
1、We have looked for kinds of ways to enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis and ultimately determined to broaden the absorption spectrum.
2、Under the recommendation of teachers, we selected Rhodobacter sphaeroides as a chassis biology.
2017.4.19-2017.4.26
1、Thanks to Dr. Haoqian Zhang from Beijing who shared his experience about iGEM and proposed improvements to our project.
