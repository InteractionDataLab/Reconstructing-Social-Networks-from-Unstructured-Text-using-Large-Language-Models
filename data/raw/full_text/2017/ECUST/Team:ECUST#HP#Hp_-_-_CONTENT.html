President Xi Jinping, at a speech at the UN office in Geneva earlier this year, stressed that &quot;ecological construction&quot; would become an important aspect of a shared international future. We have held innovation, coordination, green, open and share as our concepts of development; and we have already incorporated ecological environmental construction into the national development strategy.
