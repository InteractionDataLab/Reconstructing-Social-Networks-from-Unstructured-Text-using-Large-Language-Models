Human Practice
While China's energy reserves are among the highest in the world, China is also the world's second largest energy producer and consumer country: after the United States and Russia, the energy production output of our country ranks third in the world, and the basic energy consumption accounts for one-tenth of world’s total consumption, which ranks second in the world. However, the level of energy resources per capita is much lower than the average level of the world.
Government
Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and the society. President Xi Jinping, at a speech at the UN office in Geneva earlier this year, stressed that "ecological construction" would become an important aspect of a shared international future. We have held innovation, coordination, green, open and share as our concepts of development; and we have already incorporated ecological environmental construction into the national development strategy. Energy is the basis for everything which can joint three spheres together.
Administration
National Energy Administration held mid-2017 working meeting, and pointed out that the first half of energy development was a good trend. We achieved our goals such as constantly optimizing the energy structure, supplying effective continuous improvement, making efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation and development, strengthening the construction and operation of agglomeration energy market more orderly and comprehensively promoting international energy cooperation.
They have put together projects to help people access green energy.
Corporation
There are hundreds and thousands of small energy plants struggling for finance, as most capital usually goes to big operations. To help them, Chinese government built a bridge so financiers could work out funding issues.
Professors & Experts
We interviewed the Professor Xu Qingli from school of Resources and Environment. He told us that it was necessary to understand the expert data and opinions about energy status, which was conducive to the smooth development of the practice and timely correction.
We held a mini symposium with Professors from the school of Biology. They gave comments on our projects, which later proved to be very useful in our experimental design. Also, they encouraged us to achieve the practice with what we have learned.

Public recognition
We designed a questionnaire to get to know about the public recognition of energy crisis as well as clean energy. From the current data, we drew some conclusions as follows:
Ways to understand the current energy situation: Internet 83.33%, and 8.73% from newspapers, magazines, books, etc.
Confidence in the development of new energy: large development potential 68.25%, slow development 20.63%
For the "new energy" category of judgment: over 80% have a clearer understanding
Among them, biological energy and solar energy bear the highest expectations
More than half of respondents expressed willingness to try new energy drivers / related products, and 30% took a wait-and-see attitude
The application of new energy in society: more than 90% of respondents believe that the most useful way is to use electricity and provide transportation power
The price is too high, the quality of products is unstable and the use is inconvenient. It has become the first three reasons that prevent respondents from buying new energy products
Our vision
Green technology is the future, especially the biotechnology.
Our practice carried out practical investigation with multi-dimension, deeply explored current energy situation, the prospects for the development of a new focus on renewable energy. 
The team members actively interacted with professional expertise and conducted investigations of the energy enterprise learning its culture. Think about how to use synthetic biology methods to synthesize efficient and clean green energy.
Conclusion
What we have got through this part of human practice helps us have a better understanding of
1. The current energy policy in China
2. Investigations of energy enterprise operation mode and enterprise culture
3. Ideas on selecting the next experimental design to energy

Our basic Human Practices include the questionnaire, interview and policy survey. We expanded our Human Practices to many other aspects, during which we heard the voice from professors, veteran experts, entrepreneur managers as well as other teams. They represented some different views from the public and authorities, helping us to understand the project from different perspectives so that we could collect the feedback to interpret those results into our experimental design. Secondly, we set up our iGEM club to provide a platform for students to exchange academic knowledge.
Lastly, to improve public engagement of iGEM in China, we designed our own Chinese version brochures and postcards and distributed them to people who were interested in our project, and we received lots of valuable comments.
We conducted a game called “FRET ME”, which was an outdoor group game based on the theoretical support FRET of our project. Apart from that, we have compiled the Chinese version iGEM brochure to let more Chinese people know about synthetic biology and iGEM. We distributed our postcards and badges as souvenirs to members from other teams. As for education, we gave some lectures about the iGEM and synthetic biology inside our school, mainly for the freshmen and sophomores. Also, we help the SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai to build their own iGEM LAB, giving them rough ideas about their experimental design and guided them finish the interLab experiments.
iGEM club
This year, ECUST took part in the iGEM competition for the first time, and there are still many students in our campus who have passion for synthetic biology but have no platform or guidance to participate in such contests. Therefore, to set up an iGEM club in ECUST is of vital significance and necessity and this is exactly where we started.
FRET ME
As the main principle of our project, FRET is an interesting and useful theory. But it may be a bit obscure for undergraduates, especially those who don’t major in biology. Considering that spreading scientific knowledge to non-scientific people is another aim of iGEM, we came up with an innovation activity called FRET ME, aiming at making the concept of FRET easier to understand.

Publicity
In order to explain our project and idea in a more interesting and intuitive way, we designed our postcards containing our logo, QR code and brief slogan. We distributed them to those who were interested in our project, and they were also sent to Düsseldorf-Köln to take part in their postcard exchange campaign on behalf on Light Harvester. However, when we continued to carry out our collaboration with other teams, we found postcards far too simple to convey our principle but did better as souvenirs, which motivated us to design our brochures. The brochures, we can see, contained our project description, the theoretical support, our group members, significances of iGEM competition and other important information. In the process, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd, which is an outstanding company in the field of synthetic biology, showed great interest in our project. With the philosophy of serving the country by industries, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd thought it meaningful to carry out comprehensive study on energy crisis and try to find solutions by means of synthetic biology. After seeing our postcards and brochures, and subsequent discussions held between Light Harvester and the company, Syngen Tech Co., Ltd generously decided to give us assistance on material sponsorship. We are very grateful for what Syngen Tech Co., Ltd provided and hope that we can do better in our project and explore more potential of synthetic biology.

Wechat
In China, WeChat is a prevailing APP which is similar to Facebook and Snapchat. The articles published on WeChat are accessible to different people in different communities with different backgrounds and different occupations.
We took WeChat as the main tool for online publicity. We gave a simple description of our project and then presented the principles of iGEM and synthetic biology for readers, hoping that through the articles we could receive recognition and support from our mates. And then from the community's comments, we knew about their concerns, which were valuable in our whole design.
Collaboration
Collaborations
While it is of vital significance to carry out experiments in the lab, we also need to step out to seek for collaborations with other iGEM teams which will certainly give us a better understanding of our project and make it more far-reaching. This year, collaborations with teams and conferences came out and take a look at our collaborations now!
Instructor of SUIS_Alpha_Shanghai
Both located in Shanghai and took part in the iGEM 2017 Championship, ECUST established contact with Shanghai Xiehe High School. Serving as the instructor, we held several discussions on experimental design and assisted them on the Interlab experiments. Working with other members and teams is a necessity in scientific field, and when it comes to iGEM, it is even more indispensable.

Collaborations with SJTU
Apart from Shanghai Xiehe High School, ECUST also had collaborations with Shanghai Jiaotong University. This summer, we invited the members from SJTU to take a Lab Visiting Day in our campus and exchange ideas on iGEM competition. On top of that, we two teams also carried out collaborations on experiments such as plasmid transformation and monoclonal screening. By communicating viewpoints, we gained many valuable suggestions which are useful to refine our project.

CCiC
This August, the 4th Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) was held in Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University and some of our members attended the conference. There were many professors and scholars delivering speeches on synthetic biology and China iGEM teams sharing their projects. By communicating with professors and other teams, we gained a much deeper understanding of the principle and mechanism of Synbio.
Besides lectures and workshops, there was also time for social activities to know about other teams.

UNebraska-Lincoln survey
While surfing iGEM websites, we found there are various kinds of collaborations in Community Bulletin. The Lincoln survey from UNebraska caught our attention and we filled in it seriously, hoping to share our opinions and thoughts about greenhouse gas with UNebraska.
Düsseldorf-Köln: postcard campaign
This year, Düsseldorf-Köln launched a postcard exchange campaign. Since we’ve designed our brochures and postcards as an important means of propaganda, we took part in the campaign and sent our postcards to Düsseldorf-Köln, expecting the postcards can present our idea and design on behalf of our team.
Peking University
As one of the most excellent universities in China, Peking University always achieves outstanding results in iGEM competition. Early in this summer, we invited Haoqian Zhang from Peking University to deliver a lecture on synthetic biology and iGEM for our team members. He also gave us many valuable suggestions on our project.
