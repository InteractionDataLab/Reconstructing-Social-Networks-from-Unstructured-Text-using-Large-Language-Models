what did they do to protect environment?
Reuse of cooling (hot) water and acid base of sterilizer.
Our factory is used to produce pasteurized milk and UHT milk sterilization equipment. there is great consumption of cleaning water before and after production for heat exchange.
Through technological innovation, this part of the water had been going through recycling. And this innovation not only saved water, but also could make the waste heat to reuse. It has been implemented since June 09. In 2012, 31. thousand tons of tap water was saved, and 123 thousand and 600 cubic meters of natural gas was recovered, which was equivalent to 160.64 tons of standard coal.
Up to now, 108 thousand and 500 tons of tap water have been saved, 432 thousand and 600 cubic meters of natural gas have been recovered, and 562.24 tons of standard coal have been converted.
