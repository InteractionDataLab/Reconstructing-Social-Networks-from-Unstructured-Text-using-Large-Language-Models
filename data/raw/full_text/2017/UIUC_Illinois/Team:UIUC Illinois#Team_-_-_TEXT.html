About Us
Sophomore
Chemical Engineering
Nathan Purwanto
Hey guys I'm Nathan and I'm a sophomore in Chemical Engineering. I joined UIUC_Illinois iGEM team to try to apply my knowledge of chemical engineering and chemistry into the field of molecular biology. I'm a big fan of Manchester United and Ohio State Football, and I would also welcome any discussion about these two teams!
