Genomic DNA Extraction
GeneMark Tissue&cell Genomic DNA Purification Kit
Gram-negative bacteria: Centrifuge cells (< 2 x 109 ) at 14,000 xg for 2 min., carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend bacterial pellet in 200 μl Extraction Solution. Mix by vortexing or pipetting. Proceed to Step 2.
Gram-positive bacteria: Centrifuge cells (< 2 x 109 ) at 14,000 xg for 2 min., and carefully remove the supernatant. Incubate the pellet in - 80℃ for 5 min. (or in liquid nitrogen for 30 seconds), and then immediately incubate               the tube in 37℃ for 2 min. Resuspend the pellet in 180 μl of Lysozyme Solution. Mix by vortexing or pipetting. Incubate at 37 ℃ for 30 min. and add 200 μl Extraction Solution. Proceed to Step 2.
Add 20 μl of Proteinase K Solution to the microcentrifuge tube, mix by vortexing.
Do not premix Extraction Buffer and proteinase K solution before use to prevent proteinase K from undergoing self-digestion without substrate.
Implemented Bio-Safety to our devices.
Incubate samples at 56℃ in water bath or incubator for 0.5~3 hours or longer until complete lysis of tissue (time varies depending on sample size), vortex 5~10 seconds at frequent intervals during incubation.
Sample
Time
Cultured cells from tissue (< 5 x 106 )
0.5 ~ 1 hours
Animal or insect tissue (< 25 mg), for spleen (< 10 mg)
1 ~ 3 hours
Bacteria (< 2 x 109)
0.5 ~ 1 hours
Yeast cell (< 5 x 107 )
0.5 ~ 1 hours
To remove tissue debris, centrifuge at 14,000 xg for 5 min. after lysis is complete. Transfer the clear lysate to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Optional: If high quality DNA (no RNA contamination) is desired, add 4 μl RNaseA solution and incubate at RT for 5 min.
Add 200 μl of Binding Solution to the lysate, mix by vortexing.
Incubating at 70℃ water bath or heating block for 10 min.
A white precipitate may form after addition of Binding Solution, which dissolves during incubation at 70℃. For some tissues, the mixture may not turn clear (e.g. brain tissue), however, this does not affect DNA binding. The mixture will turn clear after                   addition of ethanol.
Add 200 μl Ethanol, mix thoroughly by vortexing, and transfer the mix (including any precipitates) to spin column mounted into a collection tube. Centrifuge at top speed for 1 min.
A precipitate may form after addition of ethanol, please do not spin. Transfer the mix (including the solution and precipitate) to the column directly.
Discard the filtrate, add 300 µl of Binding Solution to the column and centrifuge at top speed for 1 min.
This step is essential for removal of endonuclease to prevent Contamination.
Discard the filtrate, add 700 µl of Wash Solution and centrifuge at top speed for 1 min. Repeat this step once more.
Discard the filtrate and centrifuge for additional 5 min. at top speed to remove residual trace of ethanol.
If centrifugation speed is lower than 12,000 xg or residual ethanol must be removed completely, incubate the spin column in a heat oven (60~65℃) for 5 min. to evaporate all of the ethanol.
Transfer the spin column into a new microcentrifuge tube and add 100 ~ 200 μl preheated (60~65℃) Elution Solution or H2O (pH 7.0 ~ 8.5) into the column and wait for 1~2 min.
Centrifuge at top speed for 1 min. to elute the DNA. Store the eluted DNA at -20℃.
Repeating elution once will increase DNA yield by 10 ~ 15 %, though DNA will be diluted.
Plasmid Extraction
FAVORGEN FavorPrepTM Plasmid DNA Extraction Mini Kit
Transfer 2 ml of well-grown bacterial culture to a centrifuge tube.
Centrifuge the tube at 18,000 xg for 3 minute to pellet the cells and discard the supernatant completely.
Add 200 µl of FAPD1 Buffer (RNaseA added) to the cell pellet and resuspend the cells completely by pipetting.
Make sure that RNaseA has been added into FAPD1 Buffer when first use.
No cell pellet should be visible after resuspension of the cells.
Add 200 µl of FAPD2 Buffer and gently invert the tube 5 ~ 10 times. Incubate the sample mixture at room temperature for 2 ~ 5 minutes to lyse the cells.
Do not vortex, vortex may shear genomic DNA. If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the lysate become clear.
Do not proceed with the incubation over 5 minutes.
Add 300 µl of FAPD3 Buffer and invert the tube 5 ~ 10 times immediately to neutralize the lysate.
Invert immediately after adding FAPD3 Buffer will avoid asymmetric precipitation.
Centrifuge at 18,000 xg for 10 min. to clarify the lysate. During centrifugation, place a FAPD Column in a Collection Tube.
Transfer the supernatant carefully to the FAPD Column and centrifuge at 18,000 xg for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column back to the Collection Tube.
Do not transfer any white pellet into the column.
Add 400 µl of W1 Buffer to the FAPD Column and centrifuge at 18000 xg for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column back to the Collection Tube.
Add 600 µl of Wash Buffer to the FAPD Column and centrifuge at 18,000 xg for 1 minute. Discard the flow-through and place the column back to the Collection Tube.
Make sure that ethanol (96 ~ 100 %) has been added into Wash Buffer when first use.
Centrifuge at 18,000 xg for an additional 5 minutes to dry the FAPD Column.
Important step! The residual liquid should be removed thoroughly on this step.
Place the FAPD Column to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Add 65 µl of Elution Buffer or ddH2 O to the membrane center of the FAPD Column. Stand the column for 3 minute.
Important step! For effective elution, make sure that the elution solution is dispensed on the membrane center and is absorbed completely.
Do not elute the DNA using less than suggested volume (50 µl). It will lower the final yield.
Centrifuge at 18,000 xg for 3 minute to elute plasmid DNA and store the DNA at -20 ℃.
