Instructor
I-Son, Ng
Dr. I-Son Grace Ng is the Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan since 2014. She received her Ph.D. from NCKU and worked for Academia Sinica as Postdoctoral fellow; and was                 the Associate Professor in Xiamen University from 2010 to 2014. She is devoted to the study of synthetic biology, genetic and enzymatic engineering, biorefinery and bioremediation. She has developed a robust and efficient platform to explore                 the novel and functional enzymes by genetic and proteomics approach. She has established the first iGEM team in NCKU since 2015.
Han-Ching, Wang
Dr. Wang is a professor of Department of Biotechnology and Bioindustry Sciences at NCKU. Her motivation is that whereas shrimp aquaculture is one of the most important economic activities in East Asia, it is severely threatened by pathogenic diseases,                 including those caused by viruses (e.g. white spot disease; WSD) and bacteria, in particular, acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). She uses an integrated systems-biology approach including metabolomics and lipodomics to study                 pathogenesis of WSD and AHPND. She has a goal of using a science-based approach to manage and optimize aquaculture practices. She believes that this is very important for the eco-friendly sustainable shrimp aquaculture industry.
