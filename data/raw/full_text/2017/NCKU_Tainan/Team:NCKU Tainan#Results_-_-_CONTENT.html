        Our experiments are conducted by using our own assembling GFP sensing device. By adding 3ml of fixed concentration nitrate potassium into the cuvette, the solution will then mixed with the lyophilized  <I>E. coli</I> powder. Rapidly, nitrate will activate the P<SUB>yeaR</SUB> promoter which lead to expression of GFP. The result is shown as below.

        Due to too high GC content of one part sequence of <I>nar</I>, it failed to synthesize by IDT. Thus, we turned to use original <I>nar</I> cluster existed in the wild type <I>E. coli</I> MG1655 had been used in our project. However, the activity
        of <I>nar</I> in the <I>E. coli</I> MG1655 is much lower than the one we chose before. Wondering whether the activity of <I>nar</I> cluster in <I>E. coli</I> MG1655 is strong enough, we use the griess reaction to detect the nitrite concentration.
        The principle and mechanism of griess reaction are shown below. When the broth contains nitrite, by adding the griess reactant which consists of naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, sulphanilamide, phosphoric acid can form a diazonium salt
        with nitrite. The diazonium salt will have absorbance at wavelength 545 nm. By the reaction, we can further calculate the nitrate conversion.

        In our experiment, we use 1-Naphthylamine to substitute naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride. Before starting our test, we need to do the calibration curve between the absorbance at wavelength 545 nm and different nitrite concentration. The result
        was shown in Figure 2. With the calibration curve, we can deduce the nitrite concentration from absorbance in different time.

        We added 10 and 50 μM of nitrate to the broth and cultured for 4 hours. After that we add the griess reactant in order to detect the nitrite concentration. By the calibration curve, we deduced the concentration of nitrite produced, and then the conversion
        of nitrate was calculated. The conversion result is shown in Figure 3.

        In order to check our construction Biobrick: BBa_K2275008. We selected several colonies from the transformed plate and cultured in LB medium for 8 to 10 hour. Then extracted the plasmid with FAVORGEN FavorPrepTM Plasmid DNA Extraction Mini Kit and used

        Next, to ensure whether the gene <I>gudB</I> can successfully express in <I>E. coli</I> or not, we used the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to analyze the protein expression of <I>gudB</I>. The SDS-PAGE result
