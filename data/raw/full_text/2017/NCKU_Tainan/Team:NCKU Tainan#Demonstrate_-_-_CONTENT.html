        Sensing Boat
      </H2><P>
        We build a nitrate sensing boat, consisting of motor and control modules, pH meter, thermometer and the most important nitrate sensor to make it more user-friendly.
         Our sensing boat can detect exact water data immediately and prevent fish farmers from wasting a lot of time and efforts to collect water samples and deliver to professional institutes for examination.

        This is NO PROBLEM. Robust, extremely accurate, remote controlled sensing system. Users can use it to gather data immediately and automatically every day without wasting a lot of time. Nitrate sensor is a device with reactor and laser. The reactor contains
        genetically modified <I>E. coli</I> and will emit different fluorescence intensity when dealing with various concentration of nitrate in water. By determining the fluorescence intensity and cross-referring with data lines which we've built in advance,
        we can accurately calculate the concentration of nitrate in water. Additionally, pH meter and thermometer allow us to obtain basic info of water. After determining those characteristics of water and combing with GPS data, we will upload them on
        to server and transfer those data to our App. By using smartphone, the users can easily get the information about their fish pond. At last, they can make the appropriate solution before it is too late to regulate the water quality.

        Regulation Box
      </H2><P>
        Nitrate, is one of the most important nutrition for aquatics, but too much nitrate will cause eutrophication. So, we build a regulation box if our sensing boat reports us a high nitrate concentration level. When facing this problem, fish farmers would
        change water frequently to keep nitrate concentration low enough for aquatics to live. However, they can prevent this situation easily by using our regulation box.

          Turn on motor power and UV light power.

          When nitrate concentration is too high, our App will show warning for users and users can push the bottom from App to let regulation box to work.

        Regulation Box Components

        Structure of Regulation Box
      </H3><P>
        To achieve our goal, the regulation box needs to consist of some elements, that is water input hole, output hole, “motor and filter system” and replaceable grooves. When regulation box starts to work, it pumps water into the box by motor system. At the
        same time, water flows through filter system for physical water purifying and then goes into our main part, replaceable grooves, to do biological transformation. We use our manipulated <I>E. coli</I>, with genes for NiR, GS and GDH  constructed, and take
        MG1655 wild type as our pioneer. Because of the ability to transform nitrate to nitrite, to open the pathway. NiR is a kind of nitrite reductase and can make nitrate become ammonia. Furthermore, ammonia is taken as a reactant to form glutamate,
        an essential amino acid for creatures, by GDH. Due to GS catalyzing, glutamate become glutamine, a common seen and expensive content in health supplements. At last, clean water appears and the whole aqua system can stay healthy. Moreover, this
        pathway isn’t new at all. On account of this, the feasibility is a hundred percent.
      </P><DIV class="row imagerow"><DIV class="col-md-12"><P>
            It's also proved to be functional and efficient with our functional test.

        In the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:NCKU_Tainan/Results#nitrateassimilation" target="_blank">test</A> of device, first of all, we added nitrite to the tank. Then, we monitoring nitrite concentration at 2, 4, 8, 12 hours separately. Apparently, we can see that the device with our manipulated E.coli
        can sharply decrease nitrite in the water.
         For biosafety, we keep our regulation box running isolated and equip the box with biological filter which makes our device prevent from bacteria leaked and pollution. Also, we add UV light at the top of regulation box to make sure our safety
        condition stay secure.
