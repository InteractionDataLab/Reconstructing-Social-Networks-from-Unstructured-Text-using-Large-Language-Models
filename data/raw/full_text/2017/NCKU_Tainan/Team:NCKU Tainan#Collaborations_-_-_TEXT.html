Collaboration
iGEM NTHU
In this September, we received the invitation to have a collaboration with iGEM NTHU . NTHU detected environmentally hazardous substances while our project is focusing on the sensing of nitrate concentration. They try to give a broader aspect. However, we try to give a more detail sensing system. Thus, we had a profound discussion of both teams’ projects. Moreover, we also shared our fluorescence idea of 2016 and 2017 with them.
After mutual inspection and troubleshooting with both projects, we were enlightened to expand our sensing device to detect more substances like environmental hormone even heavy metal in the future, which would make our project more practical. Also, NTHU offered their investigation results of aquaculture questionnaire to us. These questionnaires strengthened our data integrity and made our project more fit to the market demand.
This collaboration combined both teams’ detecting projects. We exchanged our hardware design, principle, commercial value, and strategies, making both our projects more compatible.
Collaboration in Biosafety
Last year, we successfully constructed biobrick BBa_K1920006, an arabinose induced cell lysis complication biobrick (P_BAD-RBS-lysis-B0015), but it is not available in the distribution kit of 2017 competition. Before the meet-up with iGEM MDHS and iGEM CSMU (click here to see more), we got a information that Mingdao were interested in this brick and want to combine it into their project for biosafety design. Thus, it’s our honor to provide five Biobricks and PCR production of our construction and handed over to them in the meet-up.
