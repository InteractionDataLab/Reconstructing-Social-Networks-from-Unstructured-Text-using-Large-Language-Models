      The next step to proving the therapeutic efficacy of the presented mechanism is to ensure that the bacteria
      are actually entering their target cells and delivering the shRNA payload to them. The way in which to do this is a
      gentamicin assay. A gentamicin assay allows us to see whether the bacteria have entered mammalian cells. Essentially
      how this is done is that we leave the cells exposed to the bacteria for a given amount of time, then apply gentamicin
      to the cells, killing off any external bacteria. Then we allow for incubation and infection and observe the progression
      of the invasion using microscopy over the course of 24 hours. This will indicate whether the bacteria have truly invaded
      the cells.
    </P><H2>Mouse Models</H2><P>
      After the gentamicin assay, another important step in this project will be mouse models. We need mouse models
      to test the efficacy of this system in vivo, assess toxicity adequately, and ensure that the bacteria can reach their
      target cancer sites specifically. A study of the delivery of our shRNA containing bacteria to tumors in live mice would
      be the final step in ensuring the therapetic relevance of this mechanism.
    </P><H2>Lipofectamine</H2><P>
      eGFP HeLa cells were grown in Dulbeccoâ€™s Modified Eagle Media until they had reached 80% confluence. They
      were then split, and aliquotted into 12 individual wells. These cells were then incubated overnight. In the mean time,
      bacteria containing the eGFP shRNA were induced to produce this shRNA, which was then isolated with an miRNA mini prep
      kit. After this, concentrations of shRNA were determined via nanodrop, and a gel was run to ensure that our desired
      shRNA were present. The shRNAs were then allowed to complex with lipofectamine 2000, producing complexes containing
      the desired shRNA. The HeLa cells were then exposed to these complexes. Three wells were not exposed to anything, another
      three were exposed to just liposomes, the next three were exposed to liposomes with control eGFP siRNA, and the final
      three wells were exposed to liposomes containing eGFP shRNA. The cells were allowed to incubate for 24 hours, after
      which they were viewed under a microscope and subjected to flow-cytometry.
    </P><P>
      Lipofectamine results: The results showed that eGFP siRNA knockdown of eGFP expression in HeLa cells was less than that of
      shRNA knockdown of eGFP but greater than the control indicating that the method of gene knockdown is in-fact a viable
      method.
