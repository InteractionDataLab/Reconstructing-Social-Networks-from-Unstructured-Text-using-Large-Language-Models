Collaborations
Throughout the course of our project, we interacted with many teams and helped each other out in meaningful ways. Here is a record of our collaborations with teams from various institutions:
University
Type of Collaboration
Details
Boston University
Survey
We completed a survey on microfluidics to help Boston University gather data for their project.
DÃ¼sseldorf Cologne
Postcards
We joined many iGEM teams around the globe, led by the Cologne-Duesseldorf team, to create postcards that highlight synthetic biology and then distribute the postcards in our respective communities. Here is the front and back of our postcard:
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
Experiment / Modelling / Survey
We conducted experiments to data feed their quorum sensing model. OD measurements over 9 and 12 hrs, 10 min intervals,               of colonies carrying our quorum sensing plasmid. We also received answers for our surveys concerning bacteria               mediated cancer therapies, from both patients and field specialists.
Stony Brook University
Survey
While new treatments can be very powerful, the ability of treatments to impact patients heavily relies on the willingness of patients to embrace them. To assess how well patients will receive the treatments developed by Columbia iGEM and Stony Brook iGEM, the two teams have joined forces to create a survey that targets patient reception of bacteria-mediated treatment and antimicrobial peptides. Columbia iGEM created the backbone of the survey and Stony Brook iGEM revised it and added their own section. Stony Brook iGEM collected most of the survey participant data. We aimed for a stratified random sample of participants, specifically targeting the younger generation as well as middle-aged and older people. The statistical analysis of the results of this survey will provide insight upon patient reception of the treatments developed by the two teams.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln
Survey
We completed a survey created by the UNebraska-Lincoln team to provide our opinions on global warming and genetically modified organisms.
