            his early years. Majoring in Biology at Columbia, Noah joined the student-run Emergency Medical Service with
            the aim of making a meaningful impact on the Morningside Heights community. During the academic year when he
            is not driving the ambulance around the Columbia neighborhood, Noah can be found communing with his residents
            in McBain Hall as he is also a Resident Advisor. Noah’s previous research has helped characterize the epigenetic
            landscape of gliomas, specifically the role of the chromatin modifier CHD6 at dysregulated oncogenes. His findings
            were subsequently published in the Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal. These days when away from his cloning
            projects on the lab bench, Noah enjoys spending his time hiking and biking outdoors.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-9"><H3>Brandon Cuevas</H3><P>Brandon Cuevas is a sophomore in the Egleston Scholars Program on the pre-med track majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science.
