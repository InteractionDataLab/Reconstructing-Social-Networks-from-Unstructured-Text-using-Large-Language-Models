Columbia iGEM: Students and amazing mentors alike!
Noah Basri
A member of Columbia College’s Class of 2018, Noah Basri exhibited a keen interest in biology and medicine since             his early years. Majoring in Biology at Columbia, Noah joined the student-run Emergency Medical Service with             the aim of making a meaningful impact on the Morningside Heights community. During the academic year when he             is not driving the ambulance around the Columbia neighborhood, Noah can be found communing with his residents             in McBain Hall as he is also a Resident Advisor. Noah’s previous research has helped characterize the epigenetic             landscape of gliomas, specifically the role of the chromatin modifier CHD6 at dysregulated oncogenes. His findings             were subsequently published in the Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal. These days when away from his cloning             projects on the lab bench, Noah enjoys spending his time hiking and biking outdoors.
