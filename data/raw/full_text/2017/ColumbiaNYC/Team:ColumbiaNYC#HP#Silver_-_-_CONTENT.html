When human cells have engulfed Listeria cells by phagocytosis, Listeriolysin
            O becomes active and breaks open the phagosome, allowing the bacteria to live in the cytoplasm. Bacteria transformed
            with Listeriolysin O are invasive microorganisms with the ability to hide from the immune system. With Listeriolysin,
            bacteria can invade macrophages and then break open the phagosome, and the bacteria are free to live inside the
            cytoplasm. Genetically engineered bacteria that express both listeriolysin and invasin are able to invade any
            beta-1-integrin expressing cell type, and they can penetrate to the cytoplasm at high efficiencies.</P><P>
            The hlyA gene (coding for Listerolysin O) will be part of the transkingdom RNAi plasmid (TRIP) that the team will use to
            determine how well transkingdom RNA interference will work on different types of cancer cells and different oncogenes.

                All team members received lab safety training prior to lab work. Research compliance and administration is coordinated through
                Columbia University's RASCAL web-based application and through Columbia University's Office of Research Compliance
                and Training. Each member of the 2017 Columbia University iGEM team has undergone extensive training and
                attained certification in the use of recombinant DNA, biological safety and bloodborne pathogen precautions,
                and lab safety, chemical hygiene, and hazardous waste management. More information and resources about specific
                guidelines for safety can be found on the <A href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/compliance/index.html."> Office of Research Compliance and Training website </A> at 
                At Columbia University, the Environmental Health and Safety Department is responsible for the safety of biology
                labs. The department follows the guidelines set by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and does so through
                the &quot;application of materials substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and the use of
                personal protective equipment.&quot; A link to their guidelines can be found <A href="http://www.ehs.columbia.edu/bs.html"> here. </A>
                Safety topics discussed include lab access and rules, biosafety levels, biosafety equipment, good microbial
                technique, disinfection and sterilzation, emergency procedures, transport rules, chemicals, fires, and electrical
                safety specific to the lab space. Training was provided by the University biosafety office and by our PI's
                and Instructors. Recommendations as well as descriptions of mandatory safety and health standards are contained
                in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Laboratory Safety Guidelines found <A href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHA3404laboratory-safety-guidance.pdf"> here. </A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-lg-12"><H2>Ethical Risks and Safety Considerations</H2><P>There are safety considerations when engineering a non-pathogenic strain of bacteria to possess such virulence
            factors as invasin and listeriolysin from yersinia and listeria, respectively. By engineering otherwise attenuated
            bacteria to possess these virulence factors, the bacteria can become pathogenic. Containment precautions must
            be taken to ensure the virulence factors do not proliferate through horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, though
            our project is a proposed treatment for aberrant gene expression at the post-transcriptional level for conditions
            such as cancer, it could also be used to induce such disease states. For example, if the shRNA released from
            the invading bacteria was to interfere with a tumor-suppressor gene rather than an oncogene, cancer could be
            induced.
