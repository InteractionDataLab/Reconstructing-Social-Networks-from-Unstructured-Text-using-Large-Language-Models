Brainstorming
Here are some other ideas we came up with this summer that future iGEM teams can incorporate into their own projects:
No Pain, but Sure Gain: T-cell Targeted Nociceptive Sodium Channels
Nav1.7 is a voltage-gated sodium channel expressed on nociceptive neurons, neurons responsible for transmitting pain signals               from the PNS to the CNS. Nav1.7 is essential for normal pain sensation; if it is not expressed, the patient will               not feel pain at all, and if it is overexpressed, the patient will experience chronic pain (20% of the population               worldwide). Nav1.7 is therefore a prime therapeutic target whose blockage by an T-cell antibody would mitigate               pain, with the T cell acting as a potential analgesic. A circuit would be designed so that once the T cell binds               to the epitope, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) could be engineered to be drug-switchable so that the T cells               are controllable. This way, a physician could titrate cell activity and control timing with a drug, which is               potentially safer. An accessible drug that suppresses pain would not only be of much relevance to medicine, but               also in our daily lives.
Cancer Diagnostics Using GPCR in Yeast
Cancer is the second greatest cause of death in the United States. Nevertheless, many biomarkers have been found for various               types of cancer, such as pancreatic, breast and prostate cancer. These biomarkers that are intrinsic to a particular               form of cancer can be applied to cancer diagnostics and detection, given a specific receptor and reporter. G               protein coupled receptors, along with yeast, can be used as a reliable method of cancer detection when enhanced               with directed evolution (to induce sensitivity to high concentrations of biomarker, but not low concentrations)               and expressed alongside GFP in the presence of a strong signal.
A Long-Awaited Remedy for Hemophilia: Probiotic Hemophilia Treatment
Hemophilia A, the most common type of hemophilia, is caused by a missing or defective factor VIII clotting protein. Current               treatments are time-consuming, expensive, and unpleasant. Our idea is to create a probiotic that secretes coagulation               factor VIII into the small intestine to be absorbed into the bloodstream. We would obtain cells with mutations               in the thioredoxin reductase gene (trxB) and glutathione reductase gene (gor) in order to make E.coliâ€™s intracellular               environment oxidizing. This is necessary for the oxidation of the disulfide bonds in the Factor VIII proteins,               which along with the expression of a heterologous protein disulfide isomerase and a heterologous chaperone protein,               enhances the yield and solubility of Factor VIII proteins. The proteins will be expressed in E.coli, given the appropriate auxotrophic control sequences and gene casette. The production of the factor               VIII proteins will be tested via Western Blot, and the activity of the proteins will be observed with a APTT-based               one-stage assay. Finally, the solubility of the proteins was evaluated by verifying the presence of the proteins               in an aqueous fraction (after centrifugation).
Ecoligen: Collagen-like protein production by engineered bacteria
Most collagen products used for biomaterials or biomedical devices are extracted from animal sources. However, application                 of animal collagen carries the risk of pathogen or prion contamination and the possibility of causing allergies.                 Other problems include the lack of standardization for animal collagen extraction processes and the inability                 to modify collagen sequences to achieve different biological purposes. Compared with collagens extracted from                 animal tissues, recombinant collagens are highly pure, disease free, consistent among batches, and amendable to sequence modifications and large scale production. Such recombinant collagen can be made by E.colibacteria, allowing for the use of versatile and cheap collagen, especially in the fields of regenerative                 medicine and tissue engineering.
Here are some more ideas expanded upon in depth:
