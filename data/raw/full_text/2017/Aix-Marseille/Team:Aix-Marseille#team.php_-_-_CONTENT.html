I’ve been taking part in the Wet Lab experiments during all the past summer in order to achieve our objective.
I’ve been leaving Marseille and my team very recently for another city in France ( Lyon ) where I study health engineering as a Master degree.
Being involved on such a scale for this internship was a brand new experience for me and I’m glad I did it for all the experience it brought me. 
Manipulating, coordinating and working as a team on such a long and complete project was amazing and really gave me a decent preview of what working in a research team for a PhD would be.

I feel very close with the team I spent my summer with, and I hope they loved working (and playing!) with me as much as I loved working with them. I decided to push forwards and do the iGEM competition because it allowed me to get multidisciplinary experience and discover other aspects of science, while enabling me to learn how to coordinate properly with other lab-crews and giving me the opportunity to support the whole project in english.

Biology is fun, so helping the team this year was an awesome experience !
Software can be very useful for synthetic biology (and inversely?!), and the parallels between these two fields are also very interesting.
In particular, legal aspects are a very high stakes topic for both, and I do believe free diffusion of knowledge is necessary if we truly want these technologies to benefit humanity as a whole.

I'm studying the photosystem of purple bacteria, using molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysic technics. I'm very proud to participate to the iGEM contest as an advisor. First because I love teaching my knowledge and second because I think it's a unique human adventure. This year the team of Marseille was very motivated, they worked very hard during all the summer to achieve the experiments. I think they gave the best and I hope they will win the gold medal.

Now, as an assistant professor in Biochemistry at Aix-Marseille University, I’m excited to be on the “instructor side” of the team. My research interests focus on bacterial adaptation to the environment and on pathogenicity.
