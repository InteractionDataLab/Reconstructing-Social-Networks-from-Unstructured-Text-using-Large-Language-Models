Human Practices
Human Practice is about being able to see beyond the lab and to think about implications of a project for society.  Our team felt especially concerned about the Human Practices throughout the competition.  Like one of our team members says, "a good project poorly prepared is worse than a bad project well prepared".  We questioned ourselves, and others, about a large number of topicsÂ :
How do we present ourselves to potential funders?
How aware is the public of Xylella fastidiosa ?
What is the opinion of the public about our GMO?
Was the form of our treatment practical for farmers ?
Do the farmers feel supported in their fight against Xylella fastidiosa ?
Is our process and project safe for both consumers and environment?
Is our project relevant in fight against Xylella fastidiosa expert opinion ?
Does the future generation understand the stakes of scientific research?
Where did our project stand with respect to current GMO legislation ?
By this continued questioning, we made sure that our project was closely linked to societies concerns.  We also improved ourselves and our project every answer we got.  It made us prudent, engaged, ethical and open minded.
