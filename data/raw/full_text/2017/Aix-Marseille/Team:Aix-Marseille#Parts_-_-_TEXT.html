Parts
During the summer, several basic parts were constructed.  Some of these were not designed using the Rfc10 assembly standard but, rather, with the Rfc25 in order to construct fusion proteins.
We designed 3 parts for the quorum sensing approach:
Enoyl-CoA hydratase (Rfc10) - BBa_K2255000
Acyl-CoA isomerase  (Rfc10) - BBa_K2255001
Thioesterase (Rfc10) - BBa_K2255002
We designed 2 parts to disrupt biofilms:
Multi-Tag (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255003
EPS-Depolymerase (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255006
Finally, we designed some basic parts for the phage-like particle approach:
Xylella fastidiosa constitutive promoter + strong RBS (Rfc10) - BBa_K2255004
Domain 3 of p3 from M13 (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255005
Signal sequence of p3 from M13 (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255007
Then a collection of parts to use for the targeting of phage-like particles, each part corresponds to the domaine 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) of a different p3 protein. To test the specificity of our phage-like particle and to target other pathogenic bacteria, we made a collection of targeting parts :
p3_E.coli (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255008
p3_N.gonorrhoeae (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255009
p3_P.aeruginosa (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255010
p3_R.solanacearum_RSM1 (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255011
p3_R.solanacearum_RSS1 (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255012
p3_V.Cholerae_CTXΦ (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255013
p3_V.Cholerae_fs2 (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255014
p3_V.Cholerea_VGJΦ (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255015
p3_X.campestris (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255016
p3_X.fastidiosa (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255017
p3_X.fuscans (Rfc25) - BBa_K2255018
