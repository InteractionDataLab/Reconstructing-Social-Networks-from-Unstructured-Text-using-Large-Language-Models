SuperNova activity
We wanted to test the activity of Supernova on the colonies, so we made a protocol where we illuminated Petri dish with a 16,5 Candela 595nm Diode (lumex ssl-lx5093syc/g) for 2 hours.
Protocol:
Transform 100µL TG1 with Eprc - SN (psb1C3 plasmid, 5µL)
Into 2mL LB add 2µL of 2 DO TG1 (to get an adequate number of colonies)
Pipet up and down
From the first dilution, take 8µL and dilute it into 1mL LB
Spin at 5000rpm for 10min
Remove 850µL supernatant
Resuspend pellet (even if you can't see it)
Spread remaining 150µL on petri dish
Immediatly put on 590nm light / put control in dark
After two hours, incubate overnight
Count colonies
Number of colonies
Exposed
Not exposed
Supernova
1496
3672
RFP
3545
3638
With a RFP plasmid as a control, we have shown that there's no significant decrease of the number of colonies when the Petri dish is exposed to the light compared to when bacteria are not exposed to the light.
With this experiment, we can conclude that supernova allows us to divide the number of colonies by 2,45. Thus, its toxic action is proved.
