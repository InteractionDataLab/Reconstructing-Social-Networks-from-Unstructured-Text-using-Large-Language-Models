Human Practices
We have thought about the Human Practices from the very beginning of KILL XYL . At the beginning of the project, we drew the limits of the project and discussed which different actors were going to be involved and affected by our scientific approach. This way our project could be as adapted as possible to the needs of society.
As our project advanced and defined itself, we worked on the practical side of Human Practices:
How do we present ourselves to potential funders?
How aware is the public of Xylella fastidiosa ?
What is the opinion of the public about our GMO?
Was the form of our treatment practical for farmers ?
Do the farmers feel supported in their fight against X. fastidiosa ?
Is our process and project safe for both consumers and environment?
Is our project relevant in fight against X. fastidiosa expert opinion ?
Does the future generation understand the stakes of scientific research?
Where did our project stand with respect to current GMO legislation ?
This tree sums up the Human Practices part of our project as it grew and entwined together. To better understand what we did, you can follow the links underneath or read our summarize for silver medal or for gold medal .
