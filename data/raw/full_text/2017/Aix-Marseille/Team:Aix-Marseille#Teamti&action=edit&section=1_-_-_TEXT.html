Camille Garcia, alias California Mountain Snake
HiÂ ! I'm student in Biochemistry and Biophysics. What I love about this field is to explore complex mechanisms of molecular machines. iGEM competition appeared to me as an opportunity to build a scientific project, it's also a great social experience. Apart from that, I'm a recovering memes addict and I love cartoons, ponies and cartoon with ponies.
