Evry Paris-Saclay team collaboration
We work along the Evry Paris-Saclay team. Their project is focusing on the production of D-Psicose, which might be helpful for diabetic patients. We offered them our help to study the enzyme responsible of the conversion of D-fructose and D-psicose, the D-Psicose-3-Epimerase (EC 5.3.1).  Thus we wrote a quick review about their enzyme and we compared to its homolog.
We also study the structural characteristic of the D-Psicose-3-Epimerase of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and we made a video showing the enzyme active site.
