COLLABORATIONS
SCUT-FSE-CHINA
        We mentored a new team SCUT-FSE-CHINA. We shared with them                     the experience of how to form an iGEM team, and guided them in the rules, timelines and precautions of                     the competition. Besides, we mentored them how to standardize the genes. In return, they assisted us the design of modeling and help us write some parts of code of the MATLAB.

SYSU-Software
        We met SYSU-Software in April on a meet-up meeting among                     teams in Southern China. This year we use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in                     the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds                     of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected                     because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at                     a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since we                     were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the                     SRRz gene before the experiment, we reached out for them to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
Solution & Results
        They built a model for our project using the same algorithm                     that utilized in their software simulation section. The following is the circuit we designed for our                     project redrawn by their design platform.
        For a preciser measurement of the expression of their                     gene, SRRz gene, we used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Their model simulated the concentration                     of the GFP expressed in our system. The mathematic formula and parameters' and the results are as follows:
        The simulation result is as follow:
        The real line chart is as follow:
        The fitted curve of all the spots generated from real experiment can be seen from                     here:
        From the three figures above, they can prove that their simulation                     has the same trend of the real experiment data, which also gave us a meaningful design performance forecast.
        Besides, SYSU-Software also troubleshooted the image                     processing software of our project whose aim is to get the yellow degree of an experiment tube so that                     we can measure the concentration of the SRRz protein. They improved the system behavior and back-end                     of the software and gave some advice on during the implementation process.
Bi-direction collaboration
        During the whole collaboration process, we and SYSU-Software                     established very closed friendship. We also gave our feedbacks after they got an embryonic form of their                     main project. Besides, they also invited us for holding a high school meeting which they organized at                     very beginning.

SYSU-CHINA
        SYSU-CHINA is a friendly and open team. We had a meet up                     and exchanged our project ideas with each other. Besides, we helped each other to complete or repeat                     some experiments. We helped SYSU-CHINA team to finish a western blot, and they helped us to repeat the                     experiment verifying the lysis gene expression by measured the growth curve of our five kinds of engineering                     bacteria in different concentration of metal ions, which was really very heavy work.

Tianjin
        Tianjin team came up with the idea that they could gather all the iGEM teams whose projects were about water pollution treatment and built an alliance to unite all information and data concerning the social impact, knowledge and geographical advantages they collected during the conduction of their project. We received their collaboration request via a voice conference and tried our best to help them.

Meet-up
        We joined in CCIC and exchanged our ideas with other iGEMers.
        We held iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting with SZU-China and learned a lot from                     the meeting.
        We had a meet-up with PKU and got lots of inspiration from the previous projects.
