And it can also detect chemical substances quantitatively in a certain concentration range. Subsequently, we will link some specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions to the reporter and transform these devices into Escherichia coli BL21 to verify the feasibility of the reporter and construct engineering bacteria that can rapidly detect heavy metal ions in water.
</P><DIV class="texttitle">Background</DIV><DIV class="textsubtitle">1. The current situation of the heavy metal pollution</DIV><P>        With the expansion of the city and the development of large-scale industries, heavy metal pollution in the
                    environment has become a serious social problem. More heavy metal ions are discharged into the water
                    through mining, metal smelting, the wastewater of chemical industry, and other anthropogenic sources.
                    Most heavy metals ions are toxic to humans at even micro-concentration. As they are toxic, and can be
                    biologically enriched, they severely threaten the safety and health of humans.
                            However, the current methods of heavy metal ions detection are complex and expensive.
                </P><DIV class="textsubtitle">2. Current detection methods of the heavy metal</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">
                    2.1 Chemical methods
                             Nowadays, the major detection methods of heavy metal ions are ICP-AES, ICP-MS, AAFS, GHAAS. The advantages
                    of these methods are low detection limit and high specificity, but they require expensive instruments
                    and complex operation, which is relatively unavailable for the non - professional, and it cannot detect
                    the bioavailability of heavy metals.
                     2.2 Biosensor based on traditional reporter
                            In the past few years, some projects developed biosensors to detect heavy metal ions, most of which
                    selected GFP as the reporter. The advantages of biosensors based on GFP is low-cost, and the expression
                    of GFP can be directly measured by a certain method. However, the response of GFP usually spends 2-3
                    hours. And the measurement of fluorescent proteins requires spectrophotometers which is expensive and
                    requires professional operations.
                            Therefore, we set a goal to design a more efficient report module, and build up a series of heavy metal
                    detecting module that can efficiently and highly selectively detect heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions.
                </P><DIV class="texttitle">Design of our project</DIV><P>        To sort this problem, our team tries to develop a novel method to detect heavy metal ions, which could measure
                    the metal ions in the aqueous solution specificity and efficiently with low cost.
                            By the release of neurotransmitter, we used the lysis gene SRRz (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2360000">BBa_K2360000</A>) from the phage together
                    with the endogenous enzyme β-galactosidase as a report module, which can efficiently respond to specific
                    signal. The development of this module might sort out the problem—long respond time of traditional report
                    module—GFP. What’s more, we chose the specific heavy metal ions operons to build up our detecting modules
                    to achieve the specific detection of our method.
                            The method we developed inherited the characteristics of previous biosensors: low cost and relatively
                    convinient. Moreover, it enhances its response speed and simplifying the measurement method, providing
                    a new mean for the public to detect heavy metal ions in the environment around them conveniently and
                    efficiently.

</P><VIDEO width="100%" controls="">        According to the previous researches, we found that the depth of the color produced by the chromogenic
                    reaction is positively correlated to the lysis rate of the cells, and the lysis rate of the cells is
                    positively correlated to the intensity of the SRRz, which is induced by its operon, and finally determined
                    by the intensity of the heavy metal ions. This result made it able to be used for not only qualitative
                    detection but also quantitative measurement.
                <DIV class="texttitle">Results &amp; Demonstration</DIV><DIV class="textsubtitle">Detect&amp; Lysis</DIV><P>        We successfully developed three specific detecting devices and achieved our idea. By imitating the release
                    of neurotransmitters, the effect of our report module is very significant. Our devices can detect heavy
                    metal ions and make remarkable response in one hour. Figure 2 is one of our response effect.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">APP</DIV><P>        Based on the principles mentioned above, we developed a smart phone app to optimize our method of quantitative
                    measurement. People can use our devices to qualitatively detect whether there are heavy metal ions in
                    the solution, and use their cell phone to scan the samples after the chromogenic reaction to quantitatively
                    measure the concentration of the ions.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">Demonstrate</DIV><P>        We take water samples from water sources near metalworking plants, and demonstrate our products in the samples.</P><DIV class="texttitle">Potential applications</DIV><P>        Besides detecting heavy metal ions, our report module can also be used in various fields of detection. By combining with different detection modules to our report module, other components could also be detected. For example, a combination of a detection module that responds to aflatoxin and our reporter module can be used to rapidly detect aflatoxin.
                              Therefore, our report module could be applied to build up efficient and low-cost biosensors which would make biosensors be widely used in various detecting field.
