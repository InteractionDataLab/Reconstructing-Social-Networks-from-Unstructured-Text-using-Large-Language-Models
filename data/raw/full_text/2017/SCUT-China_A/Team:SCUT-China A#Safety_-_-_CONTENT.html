So we make efforts to protect ourselves and the environment
                            from any potential harm in the project. All efforts we do for safety can be summed up into two aspects: Safe
                            Project Design and Safe Lab Work.</P><DIV class="texttitle">Safe Project Design</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        In our project, we are trying to build a group visible and low-cost bio-sensors of heavy metal, which can detect
                            heavy metal ions in aqueous solution. We standardize the lysis gene SRRz and the β-galactosidase gene as
                            a reporter, and link some specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions to this reporter. Then we transform
                            these devices into E.coli BL21 to construct engineering bacteria that can rapidly detect heavy metal ions
                            in aqueous solution. To ensure the safety of our project, we take following measures.
                        </P><DIV class="textsubtitle">1. Non-pathogenic Chassis</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        We choose E.coli BL21i as our genetically modified chassis organism in our project. Our chassis bacteria have
                            not acquired any characteristics that would enable them to compromise human immune system/other systems or
                            evade detection and destruction by the former or facilitate spread between people/animals, which makes them
                            harmless from both a personal and public health point of view. </P><DIV class="textsubtitle">2. Harmless Parts</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        Our parts are all safe for human. We ensure that none of the genes or parts that we were assembling would act
                            as virulence factors according to current professional knowledge, and that no known pathogens would be involved
                            in our research. It is thus conclusive that none of the parts would raise any safety issues.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">3. Safe Gene Circuits</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        We use a series of specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions, which guarantees that our bacteria won’t
                            produce large amounts of protein without being induced. And as we use lysis gene SRRz as the reporter, once
                            the promoters are induced, the cells’ wall will be lysed and the cells will die. </P><DIV class="textsubtitle">4. Proof-of-concept Experiment</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        The original intention of the project is to develop a group visible and low-cost bio-sensors to detect heavy
                            metal ions in the environment. In order to prove the usefulness of this concept, we did a series of experiments.
                            At first, we use simulated pollution scenes which were constructed by dissolving heavy metal ions either
                            in TBS buffer or in environmental water samples from the lake on campus and the factory manufacturing metallic
                            materials. Moreover, we took water samples from the factory to test the function of our engineered bacteria.
                            Among all experiments, we always follow the <A href="https://2016.igem.org/Safety/Do_not_Release">Do Not Release requirements</A>.</P><DIV class="texttitle">Safe Lab Work</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        Before we start our experiments, our PI and instructors have given us lessons about safety of lab work, teaching
                            us the rules and regulations of biological experiments systematically. And members in our team have read
                            the established laboratory safety principles of our school. From that, we have learned a complete understanding
                            of experimental risks associated with synthetic biology.
                        </P><P class="lead add-bottom">        The topics in our safety training can be summarized as followings:</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">1. Biological safety</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        The strains are restricted to the lab so that the cells are continuously under rigorous control without any possibility
                            to contact the outside environment. Therefore, we have prevented recombinant DNA from flowing out into the
                            environment. Additionally, the bacterial hosts are laboratory strains which are likely to be highly uncompetitive
                            compared wild bacteria in the outside environment.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">2. Chemical Safety</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        Inevitably, we are exposed to toxic chemical reagents, such as GelRed, DEPC and so on. To reduce such risks,
                            some measures are taken when operating toxic chemical reagents. We place the toxic chemical reagents in the
                            specific safety cabinets, and relevant operations are all done in the specific fume cupboards. We also set
                            a special area for the preparation of agarose gel and agarose gel electrophoresis. Double pairs of gloves
                            are required to wear while working in this area.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">3. Safety of Electric and Instruments</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        Before starting our lab work, the electrical engineer of the lab showed us the circuit layout and told us details
                            about the use of these equipment. When finish our tasks every day, we need to take turns to check these electric
                            appliances. Before using every kind of equipment, we read the instructions a few times to avoid any safety
                            problems. And we will cut off the power when do not use them. Particularly for using centrifugal machines,
                            we will make sure that we have already balanced it and covered the lid well before centrifugation. </P><DIV class="textsubtitle">4. Transport of Materials</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        Our organisms and DNA were kept securely in the school and Imperial College laboratories and transfer of any
                            biological materials was performed under strictly controlled conditions as per the regulations - double sealed
                            containers to prevent against a leak to the surrounding environment, clearly labelled and protected. Containers
                            were clearly labelled with the details of the two labs between which they were transported and only our PI
                            was allowed to transport these from one place to the other.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">5. Disposal of waste</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom">        All wastes need to be sterilized with proper treatment. Any container that has been exposed to bacteria cannot
                            be released until they have been exposed to high temperature and high pressure sterilization.</P><DIV class="textsubtitle">6. Other Daily Rules</DIV><UL><P class="lead add-bottom">◊ We are required to wear gloves, masks and lab coats before we enter the lab. </P><P class="lead add-bottom">◊ Every time after finishing experiments, we should immediately wash hands with hand sanitizer.
                                </P><P class="lead add-bottom">◊ It is prohibited to bring foods or drinks into the lab or bring anything in the lab out. </P><P class="lead add-bottom">◊ Periodically  test and maintain the safety equipment such as fire extinguishers and emergency
                                eyewash in the lab.</P></UL><DIV class="texttitle">Laws and Policies</DIV><P class="lead add-bottom"><A href="http://www.chinacourt.org/law/detail/1993/12/id/18636.shtml">Regulations of the People 's Republic of China on National Genetic Engineering Safety Management</A></P><P class="lead add-bottom"><A href="http://www2.scut.edu.cn/biology/2012/1210/c3483a69988/page.htm">Regulations on Safety Management of Laboratory in South China University of Technology</A></P><P class="lead add-bottom"><A href="http://www.chinabaike.com/z/keji/shiyanjishu/2011/0116/166965.html">General biosafety standard for microbiological and biomedical laboratories People's Republic of China Health Industry Standard (WS 233-2002)</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="right_nav" id="right_nav"><DIV id="sidebar" style="color:#000000"><H4><A href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="naver('Safe Project Design')">Safe Project Design</A></H4><H4><A href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="naver('Safe Lab Work')">Safe Lab Work</A></H4><H4><A href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="naver('Laws and Policies')">Laws and Policies</A></H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
