We shared with them
                    the experience of how to form an iGEM team, and guided them in the rules, timelines and precautions of
                    the competition. Besides, we mentored them how to standardize the genes. In return, they assisted us
                    the design of modeling and help us write some parts of code of the MATLAB.
                    <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SCUT-FSE-CHINA/Collaborations">Linkage to SCUT-FSE-CHINA's Collaborations pages</A></P><DIV class="texttitle">SYSU-Software</DIV><P>        We met SYSU-Software in April on a meet-up meeting among
                    teams in Southern China. This year we use the Mer-merr bi-direction promoter to sense mercury (Hg) in
                    the environment. If the concentration of Hg transcend a threshold, Hg can repress the repressor of cds
                    of SRRz protein, which will lead to the expression of SRRz protein. Cells lysis process could be detected
                    because the release of the beta-galactosidase which is not able to spread cross the cell membrane at
                    a normal situation will trigger the chromogenic reaction of oNPG whose tube will turn yellow. Since we
                    were not aware of whether the design could work and the approximate range of expression level of the
                    SRRz gene before the experiment, we reached out for them to do a simulation for their genetic circuits.
                </P><DIV class="textsubtitle">Solution &amp; Results</DIV><P>        They built a model for our project using the same algorithm
                    that utilized in their software simulation section. The following is the circuit we designed for our
                    project redrawn by their design platform.
                            For a preciser measurement of the expression of their
                    gene, SRRz gene, we used GFP as a reporter in this case alternatively. Their model simulated the concentration
                    of the GFP expressed in our system. The mathematic formula and parameters' and the results are as follows:
                </P><P>        The simulation result is as follow:
                </P><P>        The real line chart is as follow:
                </P><P>        The fitted curve of all the spots generated from real experiment can be seen from
                    here:
                </P><P>        From the three figures above, they can prove that their simulation
                    has the same trend of the real experiment data, which also gave us a meaningful design performance forecast.
                            Besides, SYSU-Software also troubleshooted the image
                    processing software of our project whose aim is to get the yellow degree of an experiment tube so that
                    we can measure the concentration of the SRRz protein. They improved the system behavior and back-end
                    of the software and gave some advice on during the implementation process.
                </P><DIV class="subtitle">Bi-direction collaboration</DIV><P>        During the whole collaboration process, we and SYSU-Software
                    established very closed friendship. We also gave our feedbacks after they got an embryonic form of their
                    main project. Besides, they also invited us for holding a high school meeting which they organized at
                    very beginning.

                    and exchanged our project ideas with each other. Besides, we helped each other to complete or repeat
                    some experiments. We helped SYSU-CHINA team to finish a western blot, and they helped us to repeat the
                    experiment verifying the lysis gene expression by measured the growth curve of our five kinds of engineering
                    bacteria in different concentration of metal ions, which was really very heavy work.

We received their collaboration request via a voice conference and tried our best to help them.
    <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Collaborations">Linkage to Tianjin's Collaborations pages</A></P><DIV class="texttitle">Meet-up</DIV><P>        We joined in CCIC and exchanged our ideas with other iGEMers.
                </P><P>        We held iGEM Southern China Regional Meeting with SZU-China and learned a lot from
                    the meeting.
                </P><P>        We had a meet-up with PKU and got lots of inspiration from the previous projects.
