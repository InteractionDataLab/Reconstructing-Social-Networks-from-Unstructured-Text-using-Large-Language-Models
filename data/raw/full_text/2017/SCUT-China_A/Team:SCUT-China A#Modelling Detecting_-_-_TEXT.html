DETECTING
    In our project, we have two kinds of detecting device, one is two-component system, the other is repressor protein system.
    In two-component system, we have two main components, which we can know from its name, sensor kinase, anchoring on the plasma membrane, and response regulator, interacting with regulator sequence on DNA.
    Once Sensor kinase binds a metal ion, its function as a kinase is activated. It grabs a phosphate group from an ATP molecule in a reversible way. The process can be describes as below, where  and  are kinetics constants of the positive and reverse reaction respectively.
