However, it is very inconvenient for the public to learn about and detect the heavy metal pollution in the water sources around them. Thus, we try to design a low-cost, fast and portable tool for the public to detect the heavy metal ions in tap water and rivers around. Factories can also use it to check whether the concentration of heavy metal arrives the national drinking water safety standards.        To better understand the pollution status of heavy metals in Guangdong province, and whether our project has achieved our goal of bringing people convenience, we carried out a series of social practice. Our practice can be briefly summarized in three parts:        At first, we interviewed experts in environment, law and biological engineering, and an official of Environmental Protection Administration to collect their suggestions on our project.         Besides, we visited and interviewed some members of an electroplating factory, asking for their opinions on our project and collecting water samples for demonstration of our work.         Moreover, we conducted a questionnaire survey about public awareness of heavy metal knowledge and the demand for public science education, and tried to promote and popularize the knowledge of heavy metal pollution, synthetic biology, biological safety and iGEM, according to the feedback of the questionnaire        According to the suggestions and opinions we got from this practice, we obtained many practical ideas and then improved the final effect of our project.        What's more, we exchanged project ideas and experience with many other iGEM teams. For some teams, we helped each other with the projects in order to have a better performance together in the competition.
                </P><DIV class="textsubtitle"> The overview of our practice is as followings:</DIV><DIV class="texttitle">Silver</DIV><DIV class="img-text"><P>        We interviewed Guining Lu, a professor of environmental studies, about the pollution status of heavy metals, existing detection means and asked for advices on our project.  </P></DIV><DIV class="img-text"><P>        We interviewed Xiongwen Yang, a lawyer as well as a professor of Law School, about the existing policies and regulations about biological products.   </P></DIV><DIV class="img-text"><P>        We interviewed the Environmental Protection Administration in Zhongshan City, to acquire the policy about the environmental monitoring, the regulations of polluted water discharge and opinions on our project.   </P></DIV><DIV class="texttitle">Gold</DIV><DIV class="img-text"><P>        We visited an electroplating factory to collect water samples for verifying our project’s effect in realistic environment, and asked the responsible person what problems they would encounter in the practical testing.    </P></DIV><DIV class="img-text"><P>        We interviewed three professors of biological engineering, Junjiu Huang, Yaqin Wang and Lizhen Huang, asking for suggestions on our project.     </P></DIV><DIV class="texttitle">Public Engagement and Education</DIV><DIV class="img-text"><P>        We set up iGEM Club and organized winter training and weekly presentation letting freshmen have a better understanding of synthetic biology.
