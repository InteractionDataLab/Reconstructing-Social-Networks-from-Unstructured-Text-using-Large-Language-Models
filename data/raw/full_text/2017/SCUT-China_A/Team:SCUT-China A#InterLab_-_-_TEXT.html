Background
        All of the 2017 iGEM teams are invited and encouraged to participate in the Fourth International InterLaboratory Measurement Study in synthetic biology. Our team join in this study which aims to standardize the measurements of GFP’s fluorescence. And this year our task is measuring some RBS devices that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable. In this study, we were using plate reader for measuring.

Discussion
        Although we’ve finished this work, we made some mistakes. We are sorry about that there is something wrong with our data, because we used the Tecan_m200_Pro plate reader and we chose Optimal as our gain setting.
