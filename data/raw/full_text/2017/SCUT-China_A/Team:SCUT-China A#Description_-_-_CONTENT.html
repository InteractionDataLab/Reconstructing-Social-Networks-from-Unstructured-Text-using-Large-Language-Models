According to our research there are more metal mineral resources in the southwestern and southern China in which the heavy metal is the most common pollutant. In the southwestern and southern China Cd is the main pollutant while As is the second one. But in Guangdong province, the location of our university, Pb pollution is more serious than As.</P></DIV><DIV><H2>Problem</H2><P>The most common heavy metal detection methods are Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Atomic Emission Spectrometry (AES) both of which can detect ppm (parts per million) levels of heavy metal ions. The detection accuracy of these techniques have reached the national standard but the fee of them is hard to afford for the small factories and individuals.</P></DIV><DIV><H2>The solution</H2><P>Aiming to detect the concentration of the heavy metal in a short time, we use biosensors to detect the heavy metal. SRRz is used to lysis the cell and then Î²-galactosidase is released to the environment where it combines with the oNPG to produce the yellow o-Nitrophenol. Using an application in your phone to scan the color you can quickly receive the concentration of a specific heavy metal ion.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
