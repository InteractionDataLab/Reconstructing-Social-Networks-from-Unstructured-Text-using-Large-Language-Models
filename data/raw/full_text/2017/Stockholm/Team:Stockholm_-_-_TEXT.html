A mucus degrading lung probiotic
Mucus belongs to your bodyâ€™s cleaning apparatus.
When you inhale harmful particles and pathogens, they will get captured by the mucus. Tiny hairs constantly move the mucus with the entrapped particles and pathogens out of the lungs.
Diseases like asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis produce too much and too thick mucus in the lungs.
This results in:
Frequent lung infections
Breathing difficulties
Reduced life quality and life expectancy
To solve these problems, we aim to create PROlung, a mucus-degrading lung probiotic which autonomously can regulate the thickness of the mucus and restore the lung to its healthy state.
