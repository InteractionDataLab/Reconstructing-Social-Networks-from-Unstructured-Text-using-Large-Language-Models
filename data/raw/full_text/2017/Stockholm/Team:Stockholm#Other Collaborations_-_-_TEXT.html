Makerspace
iGEM Stockholm 2016 initiated a collaboration with the local community lab at Stockholm Makerspace, with the end goal of creating a long term relationship able to transcend specific iGEM teams. The collaboration in 2016 consisted of three workshops in synthetic biology who anybody could participate in - no previous experience needed. Two of the attendants of the workshops were studying design and communication, and had no experience of lab before. The two of them enjoyed the workshops to such extent that they ended up applying for iGEM Stockholm 2017, and we are all so glad that they did. Jutta and Rasmus have not only been in charge of our media department, but have also conducted research projects on their own.
This year, we have carried on the collaboration with Stockholm Makerspace, however, we are planning to carry out our plans after the Giant Jamboree to boost the recruitment for the new year. It is essential for us to be engaged with the iGEM community even after Boston. The makerspace also kindly donated materials and equipment for our participation at Kids Hack Day.
Gather Festival
Gather Festival in Stockholm was held for the first time, and we were invited as speakers. Gather is a combination of a conference and a music festival with the aim to get its attendees to question, collaborate and think differently. We hosted a discussion about the ethics and difficulties of gene editing during “Man vs. Machine”, one of the conference’s five themes. This was one of our event for public engagement and education.

Kids Hack Day
In October we hosted a station at Kids Hack Day in Stockholm, an educational event to inspire children to be curious towards the world. Kids Hack Day has previously been aimed more towards programming and robotics, so they were delighted we for the first time could host a station about biology. This was one of our events for public engagement and education. For more information, please click here.
Riksförbundet Cystisk Fibros (The Swedish Cystic Fibrosis Association)
Astma- och allergiförbundet (Asthma and Allergy Association)
Riksförbundet HjärtLung (The Swedish Heart and Lung Association)
Our three main target patient groups were patients suffering from asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. We reach out to their respective Swedish association in order to get more information on what it’s like for the patients to live with these diseases. The associations were kind enough to send out our survey to their patient databases regarding the need for a new medication targeting mucus. For more information on the results of our survey, please click here.
Riksförbundet Cystisk Fibros (The Swedish Cystic Fibrosis Association) also invited us to participate in their biggest event, CF-spelen (CF-games) at the Olympic stadium in Stockholm. For more information on the CF-games, please click here.
