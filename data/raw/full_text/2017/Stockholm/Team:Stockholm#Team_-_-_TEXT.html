Team
The 15 of us come from four different universities in Stockholm, Sweden. We proudly represent the medical university Karolinska Institutet, the engineering  university KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Konstfack, the university college of arts, crafts and design, and Hyper Island, a creative business school. We are a multidisciplinary team comprised of biomedical, medical students, engineers and designers.
Representing various disciplines, nationalities and cultures, our team is diverse in every sense. This diversity intersects with the iGEM spirit and values striving to develop a novel project.
We truly believe that this mix of backgrounds, experiences, and mindsets is what makes us strong as a team; constantly pushing each other to think outside of the box.
Although we understand the importance of commitment and responsibilities of participating in iGEM, we also understand how important it is to have fun. Every month, we organised non iGEM related events where we could simply hang out as a group of friends. We learned how to fence, supported our member Morgan at his American football game, went bouncing on trampolines, were camping out in the forest, and so much more. At the end of our iGEM journey, we consider iGEM Stockholm a close-knit family.  Wanna have a peek into our team spirit? https://www.instagram.com/igemstockholm/
