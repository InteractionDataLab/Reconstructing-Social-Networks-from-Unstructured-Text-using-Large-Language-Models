The lungsâ€™ main responsibility is to inhale - deliver oxygen from the air to the blood, and to exhale - transport carbon dioxide from the blood to the air. Unfortunately air does not only consist of oxygen. It might also contain harmful particles such as dust, allergens and pollutants. In order to protect the body from these foreign particles, the lungs are covered in something called mucus. Mucus is a viscous substance which traps these foreign molecules, and consequently prevents them from entering the body. Tiny hairs called cilia constantly move the mucus with the entrapped pathogens upwards and out of the lungs. Thus, the mucus functions as a protection against the outside world, continuously keeping the airways clear of foreign particles.
</P><H4>The sick lung</H4><P class="igem-text">
Some respiratory diseases cause an overproduction of too thick mucus. Consequently, the cilia are no longer able to transport the mucus, and it starts to accumulate. Thus, lungs with too much mucus are faced with two significant problems. One, as the mucus is stationary, the foreign particles cannot be removed, and two, the mucus will start to accumulate and occlude the airways, ultimately forming a plug which will completely stop the airflow.
</P><H4>Diseases featuring thick mucus</H4><P class="igem-text">
Some of the diseases affected by this symptom are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis, all together affecting almost 300 million people around the world. Additionally, some less well known diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and bronchiectasis share the same condition.
</P><H1> Our solution </H1><H4>PROlung - a mucus degrading lung probiotic </H4><P class="igem-text">
We plan to address the problem with thick mucus in the lungs by engineering a lung probiotic. We call it PROlung. Our goal is to engineer a bacteria which is able to safely reside in the lungs, sense when the mucus is becoming too thick, and subsequently make it normal again by expressing mucus degrading enzymes in a self-regulating manner.
</P><H4>Our project was divided into three parts:</H4><H4> Biocontainment - designing a system to make sure the bacteria is safe</H4><P class="igem-text">
To ensure that our engineered DNA was well contained within our bacteria, we employed a kill switch containing a toxin and a repressor, and added an antitoxin as a second layer of protection.
</P><H4> Sensing system - testing and characterization of a promoter able to sense thick mucus</H4><P class="igem-text">
When diseases cause the mucus to become too thick, the osmotic pressure of the mucus will rise, marking it as pathogenic. We therefore decided to make use of a promoter sensitive to osmotic pressure.
</P><H4> Enzyme system - expression and secretion of enzymes capable of degrading mucus</H4><P class="igem-text">
The enzymes sialidase and endo-beta-galactosidase have already been proven to alter the mucus composition. Our aim was to successfully express and secrete these enzymes, as well as confirm their desired effect on mucus.
