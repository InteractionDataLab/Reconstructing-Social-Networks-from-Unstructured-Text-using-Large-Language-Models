Collaborations
During the later half of the iGEM season, our team was fortunate enough to be able to collaborate with the UMaryland iGEM team. Together, we helped improve each other’s presentations and gave feedback on each other’s projects.
On October 7th, our team presented to the public for Baltimore Innovation Week at our community lab, the Baltimore UnderGround Science Space (BUGSS). The UMaryland team came to watch us present, and gave us valuable feedback. While they were at BUGSS, they were also able to conduct outreach with the people that were there for Baltimore Innovation Week.
On October 21st, the UMaryland team came and showed us their presentation. We were able to learn more about presenting well, and they were able to get feedback on their presentation.
Using the allergen screening protocol that we wrote (learn more about it here ), our team also helped the UMaryland team characterize their biobricks.
For the biobrick Part:BBa_K2477003 , there was a 28.7% of identity match and 47.1% similarity match to major latex allergen Hev b 4 from Hevea brasiliensis, in the allergen database. This means that the biobrick part is NOT of potential allergen status. In 80 amino acid alignments by FASTA window, no matches found that are greater than 35% for this biobrick. This also means that there is not of potential allergen status.
For the biobrick Part:BBa_K2477006 , there were several matches. The top two matches were at 63.4% of identity match and 83.4% similarity match to Thaumatin-like protein PWIR2 and 55.5% of identity match and 79.1% similarity match to Pathogenesis-related protein precur. This means that the biobrick part IS of potential allergen status. People using this part should consider the risk when using this in lab, for production, or in the environment. In 80 amino acid alignments by FASTA window, there were 33  matches found that are greater than 35% for this biobrick. This also means that this part is of potential allergen status. The majority of the matches are bannana-related proteins.
