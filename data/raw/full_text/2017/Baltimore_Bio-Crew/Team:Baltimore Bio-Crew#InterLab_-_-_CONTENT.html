Baltimore Bio-Crew tested went through the protocols for generating the Interlab data. However, we ran into troubles because of the limitations of the instruments at the community lab we work in. The interlab data analysis it is necessary to generate data in a reproducible manner comparing absorbance data to determine cell density to Fluorcine readings. We had to adapt the protocol during the Abs600 readings because our plate reader does not have the ability to read Abs600 due to lack of an appropriate filter, although we do have the filters to read fluoricine. Instead, we manually took replicates only of each of the samples with our spectrophotometer, which is a BioPharmacia Ultraspec 2000. We were unaware of the limitations of our instrument prior to setting up the InterLab experiment so we were of limited resources and time to adapt. Due to this, we were unable to do more replicates at the time of experiment and only took two replicates for each sample instead of the four replicates. We were able to learn a lot during the process of acquiring this data and following the protocols of the Interlab but we are regretful that our data will not be useful for iGEM and to fulfill the requirement for the bronze medal. To attempt to fulfill requirements and contribute to iGEM biobrick parts we assessed the top ten coding parts in Well Documented Parts and Frequently Used Parts.
