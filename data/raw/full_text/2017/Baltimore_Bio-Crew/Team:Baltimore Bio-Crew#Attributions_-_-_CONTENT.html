The Baltimore Under Ground Science Space (BUGSS), a DIY community lab space, is where we spent most of our time working on this project. Dr. Tom Burkett, the founder of BUGSS, provided us with space and lab equipment, and many of the materials, reagents, and enzymes needed for our work in the lab were provided by BUGSS.

A while before the Jamboree, we presented our work to all of the members at BUGSS' open house event. They listened to what we had and gave us useful advice on how to make our presentation better.

We put together our poster and oral presentation. Then had feedback from members of BUGSS, the members of the University of Maryland College Park IGEM team, and scientists from the Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET) who advised us on public speaking.

Dr. Laun, Dr. Scheifele, Dr. Burkett supervised our wetlab work, which we started in July. They provided us with the procedures we needed, taught us basic lab skills, and answered any questions we had along the way. They were also the ones we went to when we needed advice on difficult techniques, and they helped us by taking pictures of gels and plating cells when our experiments ran really long. Ryan Hammond helped us by preparing plates and taking plates out of the incubator for us. Dr. Frank Burns assisted us with the interlab and answered many questions we had from a wide range of subjects.

Baltimore Beyond Plastic collaborated with us on multiple projects such as the &quot;Why We Care&quot; Project, etc. IMET allowed us to present at the screening of “A Plastic Ocean.” These two organizations collaborated with us on many occasions. They were always willing to help us.

Dr.Tom Burkett, founder of BUGSS, provided us with the space and lab equipment, and many of the materials, reagents, and enzymes needed for our work in the lab. The expert advice and mentorship we received through BUGSS, along with the time given up by Dr.Laun and Dr.Scheifele on various days in the summer until the time of the jamboree, allowed us to focus on our goal and complete our iGEM research project. Their support was a catalyst for us to work harder within the lab. Lemon Bunnie (find his art on YouTube) made our construct pictures for the composite parts page.

The VWR foundation, the Becton Dickinson Medical Technology, the Fabian Kolker Foundation, the Robert W. Deutsch Foundation, Maryland Recycling Network, and the Family League of Baltimore provided us with grants, and BUGSS covered the rest of the cost.
