NOTEBOOK
Week1
Gene synthesis at Kingsley Corporation
Order chloramphenicol, related antibodies, BCA kit
2017/6 / 20-2017 / 6/26
Week2
Gene synthesis at Genescript
Start Interlab
Plasmid transformation, picking a single clone, amplification, determination of absorbance
2017/6 / 27-2017 / 7/3
Week3
small amount of plasmid was extracted and sequenced
2017/7 / 4-2017 / 7/10
Week4
Sequence is correct, the plasmid mentioned, get enough plasmid
2017/7 / 11-2017 / 7/17
Week5
Resuscitation of Jurkat cells
2017/7 / 18-2017 / 7/24
Week6
Jurkat cell proliferation, partial state is poor, discarded
Recovery another Jurkat cell
Recovery HEK293
2017/7 / 25-2017 / 7/31
Week7
Continue to develop Jurkat and HEK293
2017/8 / 1-2017 / 8/7
Week8
Lentivirus plasmid packaging in HEK293, virus particle extraction, concentration
The titer is low and does not meet the requirements
2017/8 / 8-2017 / 8/14
Week9
