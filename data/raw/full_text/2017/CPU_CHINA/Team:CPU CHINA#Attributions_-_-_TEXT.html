Qihang Zhao played a very important role in the team and was one of founders and leaders of our team. He was majored in establishment of the team, experiment design and cell experiment.
Sisi Qu, as a co founder and co-leader of CPU_CHINA, was responsible for team management and presentation. In the meantime, she participated in website design, producing video and paperwork.
Xin Li, one of co-founders and co- leaders of our team, was mainly responsible for molecular experiment and joined in the manufacturing of the poster.
Jinjing He took part in modeling, part construction and was responsible for part submission. She created the models with her knowledge and translated the description of modeling.
Chu Zhang was in charge of the ideas and implement of human practice. She organized the activities, the meetings with doctors and patients in the hospital.
Minye Yu is responsible for paperwork and part of genetic engineering experiment. He cultured the Jurkat cells and extracted the plasmid.
Liujun He was majored in the human practice and the Interlab experiment. He drafted the survey questions and collected the data from the survey and gave the instruction about our project.
Baoqiang Chen devoted himself to modeling, the design of team mascot, producing video and Wiki. He conducted computer programs in modeling, updated the pictures and experimental process in our wiki.
Yuchuan Su was the leader of modeling group and finished excellent work in modeling. He created the models that can help us solve the problems in our project.
Tengjie Yu was responsible for experiment about plasmid construction and extraction. He also participated in the activities of human practice to communicate with patients.
