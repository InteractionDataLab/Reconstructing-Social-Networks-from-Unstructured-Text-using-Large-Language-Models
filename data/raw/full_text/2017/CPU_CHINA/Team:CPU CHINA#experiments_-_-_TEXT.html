√ Electrical transfection
→ Reagents :
DNA: 0.2 - 2.0µg/µl purified plasmid DNA
Pipette glass: glass capillary tubing, boroscilicate, standard wall with filament (World Precision Instruments             Inc.)
Electrode tip diameter will depend on the application.
→ Protocol :
Micropipettes : A micropipette and Picospritzer are used to pressure inject DNA into the brain ventricle. The shape             and size of the pipette tip is not critical, but it must be sharp enough to easily pierce the tissue, and large             enough to quickly deliver the DNA. We use the Picospritzer II to deliver 75-125nl DNA solution directly into             the tadpole brain ventricle. The same pipette is used for multiple animals.
DNA solution : We tested a range of plasmid concentrations (using Clontech pEGFP) and found that concentrations             ranging between 0.2 - 2.0µg/µl yield comparable numbers of fluorescent cells, with similar intensity of GFP fluorescence.             DNA can be diluted in dH2O, buffered saline, or 2mM CaCl2. The DNA solution was colored with 0.01% fast green             as a visual aid for filling the brain ventricle. For co-electroporation of two plasmids, we mix plasmids in a             ratio of 1:1. This typically gives a co-transfection rate of 70% ±10% (determined for the simultaneous electroporation             of of pEGFP and pDsRed).
Setup:A dissecting microscope with good optics is sufficient. The micromanipulators are placed either side of             the stage. One manipulator holds the micropipette, connected to the Picospritzer. The other manipulator holds             the platinum electrodes connected to the capacitor and stimulator.
Procedure : The anesthetized tadpole is placed on a moistened kimwipe on the center of the microscope stage.             The micropipette containing DNA is inserted into the ventricle of the tadpole brain, and the DNA is pressure             injected into the ventricle. For widespread electroporation, DNA is injected to fill the entire brain ventricle.             For targeted electroporation of a specific brain region, a concentrated bolus of DNA should be injected as close             as possible to the region of interest. The micropipette is removed, and the platinum electrodes are immediately             lowered to contact the tadpole's skin, spanning the brain region of interest (see Fig. 2). 2-7 voltage pulses             are delivered (depending on desired level of transfection). Effervescent bubbles are produced at the electrode             tips where they contact the skin. The level of effervescence is a good indicator of whether you have achieved             electroporation vs electrocution. There should be numerous small bubbles along the electrode tips.
If the bubbles are large and bubbling over, the voltage is too large and the animal will die. Another visual             cue is the amount of shock the tadpole displays. The tadpole eyes usually flick in response to the electroporation.             If the whole body jolts, the voltage is too large. After electroporation, the tadpole is quickly returned to             rearing solution, where it usually recovers within 10 minutes.
The DNA constructs can be targeted to just one side of the brain, or if desired, the whole brain can be transfected.             This is achieved by regulating the voltage polarity. If only one side of the brain is to be transfected, the             polarity setting on the stimulator is set so the negatively charged DNA moves towards the positive electrode.             If both sides of the brain are to be transfected, the polarity must be switched while the voltage pulses are             being delivered.
Stimulation parameters : Depending on the number of transfection cells desired, 2 - 7 pulses of 30 - 50V with             an exponential decay of 70 ms are optimal. To transfect fewer cells, reduce the numbers of pulses.
Detecting transfected cells : Transfected cells expressing GFP are detected by standard fluorescence microscopy.
Trouble shooting : We occasionally see some bleeding in the brain ventricle 24 hrs after electroporation. This             usually clears up by 48 hrs. Propidium iodide staining indicated that electroporation does not cause an increase             in cell death. For good charge conduction: - Ensure that the specimen remains moist - The platinum electrodes             must be cleaned regularly.
Plasmid extraction
→ Reagents :
Solution I
50 mM glucose
25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0)
10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)
Autoclave, and store at room temperature.
Solution II
0.2N NaOH
1% SDS
Store at room temperature in a plastic bottle. Don''t autoclave.
Solution III
5M potassium acetate 60 ml
glacial acetic acid 11.5 ml
Distilled water 28.5 ml
Store at room temperature. This solution can be autoclaved. However, we usually use this solution without autclaving.
→ Protocol :
1. Shake E. coli harboring plasmid at 37 C overnight in 50 ml of TB containing appropriate antibiotics. (when using             ampicillin, addition of the antibiotics to 100-200 ug/ml rather than usual 50 ug/ml may improve the yield of             plasmids.)
2. Spin the bacterial culture at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C. Discard the supernatant.
3. (0ptional) Suspend the cell in about 20 ml of deionized water. Spin again. Discard the supernatant. Remove             all of the supernatant fluid using pipetman.
4. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of Solution I.
5. Add 10 ml of Solution II. Mix well by inverting the bottle more than 10 times. The solution should be clear             after mixing Solution II.
6. Add 7.5 ml of Solution III. Mix well as above.
7. Spin the lysate at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C.
8. Transfer the supernatant into a new bottle. Add about 15 ml of isopropanol, mix well, and store the bottle             for 10 min at room temperature.
9. Spin at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C. Discard the supernatant. Remove all of the fluid using pipetman.
10. Dissolve the pellet in 600 ul of TE. Transfer the solution into a microfuge tube.
11. Add 200 ul of 8M LiCl. Mix well, and then spin the solution at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 C.
12. Transfer the supernatant containing plasmid DNA to a new microfuge tube. Add 600 ul of isopropanol. Mix             well, and then spin the solution at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 C.
13. Discard the supernatant. Rince the pellet and the wall of the tube with 500 ul of cold 70% ethanol. Discard             the fluid.
14. Add to the pellet 400 ul of TE containing DNase-free RNase A (20 ug/ml). Incubate the tube for 30 min at             37 C.
15. After 30 min, carefully check the content of the tube. If nucleic acid pellet is visible at the bottom of             the tube, vortex well to dissolve the pellet. Incubate the tube at 37 C for further 30 min.
16. Add 240 ul of 2M NaCl, 20% PEG8000. (PEG6000 supplied from Japanese suppliers is essentially equivalent             to PEG8000, and works well.)
17. Spin at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. Rinse the pellet with 300 ul of cold 70% ethanol.             Discar the fluid. Dissolve the pellet in 400 ul of TE. (Optional: Repeat PEG precipitation once more. This is             recommended for preparing dephosphorylated linear vector since trace amount of short RNA in the vector preparation             may interfere with the dephosphorylation reaction.)
18. Extract the plasmid solution with chloroform to remove PEG. Take aquaous phase. Extract the aquaous phase             with phenol. Take aquaous phase. (Optional: Repeat phenol extraction until no interphase is visible. This is             recommended for preparing the template for in vitro transcription.)
Extract the aquaous phase with chloroform or ethylether to remove trace amount of phenol dissolved in the solution.             Take aquaous phase (or remove organic phase).
19. Add 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 3 volume of ethanol into the plasmid solution. Spin at 14,000 rpm             for 5 min at 4 C. Discard the supernatant. Rinse the pellet with 200 - 500 ul of 70% ethanol.
20. Store the open tube on the bench until the visible traces of ethanol have evaporated.
21. Dissolve the DNA pellet in 200-500 ul of TE. Typically 300-800 ug of plasmid should be obtained if the plasmid             have pUC-based replication origin.

0.8 M sodium citrate / 1.2 M NaCl
isopropanol (2-propanol)
chloroform
75% EtOH in DEPC H2O
RNase free water (filtered or DEPC)
→ Protocol:
1.cell lysis
 Cell lysis only takes a few minutes per well, but tissue homogenisation can take 10-20 minutes per                    sample depending on how tough the tissue is.
a)(PBS wash)
b)add trizol (cell lysis)
1ml / 3.5 cm diameter well (6-well)
5ml / 75 ml bottle
c)homogenise by pipetting several times (mechanic lysis)
alternative for tubes: vortex 1 min
alternative for tissue: grind 1 g tissue in liquid nitrogen in a motar and pestle, put tissue into plastic                  screw-cap centrifuge tube + 15 ml TRIzol reagent, incubate samples for 5 min at room temp or 60° C (scaled up as needed)
d)(5min at RT for complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes)
 RNA is stable in trizol which deactivates RNases. You can take a break at this point keeping the sample                  in trizol for a short time or freezing it for a longer one.
 phase separation
15-45 min depending on number of samples and whether an additional chloroform wash is necessary
a)add chloroform (1/5 volume of trizol; e.g. 0.2ml to 1ml)
b)shake for 15 sec (Eccles protocol: do not vortex)
c)incubate 2-5 min at RT
d)spin max. 12000g, 5-15 min, 2-8°C
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif centrifugation hasn''t been sufficient the DNA-containing interphase will be cloud-like and poorly compacted
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf supernatant appears turbid an additional chloroform cleaning step can be inserted here.
e)transfer aqueous upper phase into new tube
 Take care not to aspirate the DNA-containing white interface. This quickly happens and will lead to DNA contamination in your RNA prep.

 RNA precipitation and wash
 20-40 min depending on number of samples
a)add isopropanol (70% of aqueous phase or 1/2 trizol volume)
b)0.8 M sodium citrate or 1.2 M NaCl can be added
c)(incubate 10min at RT)
d)spin max g, 10-15 min, 4ºC
e)remove supernatant
f)(alternative RNA precipitation - RNeasy from Qiagen) better than alcohol precipitation for smaller                      amounts of RNA (less risk of losing a miniscule nucleic acid pellet); also reduces risk of organic solvent contamination
similar kits to RNeasy: MinElute kit, or Affymetrix sample clean-up
 RNA wash
 15-30 min( depending on number of samples)
a)wash pellet 70% EtOH (add & vortex briefly)
70% ethanol prepared with RNase-free water
 some prefer to wash the pellot more than once with 70% ethanol
b)spin max g, 2-10 min, 4ºC
c)air-dry pellet for 5-10 min  Do not overdry the pellet or you won''t be able to redissolve it.
 optional add RNase inhibitor
d)incubate at 55-60 C° for 10 min if hard to redissolve
e)transfer to eppendorf tube
f)spin 4° C, 5 min (to pellet undissolved material)
redissolving of RNA
a)dissolve pellet in 50-100 µl filtered or DEPC H2O (note: DEPC inhibits RT reaction)
b)alternatively, 0.5% SDS
pipetting up and down, heat to 55-60°C for 10 min
