DOUBLE CAR-Treg   VS   Rheumatoid   Arthritis
A fatal fight between traditional disease and emerging therapeutics!
Description
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a serious chronic, inflammatory and systemic autoimmune disease. It occurs virtually in all races of the world. RA presents great pain and financial burden for patients, but for the time being, there is no radical cure for RA. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a kind of novel targeted cell therapy for RA. To solve the problems existing in the current treatment of RA, we design and built a totally new immunotherapy. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, which can suppress and regulate immune reaction, are engineered by inserting a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) using lentiviral vectors to recognize inflammatory cells associated with rheumatoid arthritis. At the same time, we insert another receptor to activate the functional stability pathway of regulatory T cells in the inflammatory environment, and thus make it possible for them to play their role of immunosuppression more efficiently and more stably in lesions, so that this therapy can reach a good anti-RA effect. These two redirections of the two different system on the native regulatory T cell response ensure the efficacy and efficiency of our novel immunotherapy for RA.
