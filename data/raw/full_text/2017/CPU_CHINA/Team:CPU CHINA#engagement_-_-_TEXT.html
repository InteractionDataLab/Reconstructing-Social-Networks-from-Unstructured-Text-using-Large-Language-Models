Summary
It is an opportunity for every single person to understand the competition, together with a new frontier in synthetic biology. All of our team members actively organized various academic activities, and participated in many meetings inside and outside school to promote teachers and students to comprehend the field of synthetic biology, as well as to improve the international influence of iGEM. At the same time, it also made our team members accumulate cutting-edge knowledge, and provided a strong guarantee for the improvement of the subject
CPU BioX Club Academic Association
In the joint efforts of CPU_CHINA iGEMers, we established the first life science academic  association of China Pharmaceutical University---- CPU BioX Club (Figure 1). The daily activities of CPU BioX Club include:
Figure 1. The speech meeting for establishing the club
1. Journal Club
It holds mainly by students of CPU BioX Club to explain the literature, so that other associators can understand the life science within various sub-disciplines of cutting-edge knowledge well (Figure 2).

2. Holding the debate contest
We encourage all students to participate in the debate contest and feel the beauty of life science(figure3).

3. Organizing thematic academic reports
According to the content which students were interested in, we invited some teachers, sometimes, of the relevant research areas to come to  have the academic reports on their research areas to explain for the students Q & A doubts(figure 4).

Teaching in high school
Invited by the biology teacher of the senior secondary school affiliated to the Bohai University in Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province (Figure 5), a member of our team went to the high school for the students who were interested in biology to introduce the progress of synthetic biology and immunotherapy research, actively promoted iGEM, and guided more people to join us in the development of synthetic biology to contribute their own strength.

Communicating with other teams
We held academic exchange activities with the other two teams, NJU-CHINA and NAU-CHINA.
Asking the team of Nanjing University for experience
At the Life Science Building Conference room in Nanjing University, the two leaders talked about the progress on their own subjects and the status quo of the team. Yu Zhou, the leader of Nanjing University team, told us about their recent sessions of the iGEM, and explained some important time node, like human practice attention points, the contents of the two co-operation and other issues. Also, he showed our team members around their labs(figure6).

Inviting NJU-CHINA to attend academic debates.
In order to enhance the exchange between two teams, we invited the iGEM team of Nanjing University to attend the academic debate (Figure7). Two teams conducted a debate on whether changes in epigenetic modification can determine tumorigenesis at the China Pharmaceutical University Conference Center:
Proposition: CPU _CHINA
Attitude: epigenetic modification can cause disease changes
Counter: NJU-CHINA
Attitude: changes in epigenetic modifications cannot determine tumorigenesis
The two sides held different arguments, and cited frontier knowledge of self-argument and deduction to express their views. Also, two teams obtained a lot of gains during the debate, and made a further exchange on the issue of respective topics.

Participating in experience sharing meeting at Nanjing Agricultural University
Invited by the iGEM team of Nanjing Agricultural University, we participated in experience exchanging meeting (Figure 8). The meeting invited Haoqian Zhang, the predecessor of Peking University iGEM team, to share his experience. According to his previous experience, all the notes on the formation of the team and participation in the Giant Jamboree have been described in details and shared with us about the personal experience of participating in the iGEM competition.
