By comparing the data collected, we chose rheumatoid arthritis and other refractory autoimmune diseases for our project. Conducting thorough field studies and understanding the current clinical status of rheumatoid arthritis were very important to our design and optimization.
                 Through field studies, we knew that Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy satisfies the patient's desire for new
                therapies, and through a questionnaire survey of physicians, we concluded that Syn-Notch CAR -Treg cell therapy
                just hold the advantages of the minor side effects and lower recurrence rate compared to existing drug treatment.
                In designing the therapeutic method, we were also fully dependent on the patient's request for new therapies
                to meet current clinical needs.
                 We actively design, perfect and verify our own project. In the meantime, it is an opportunity for every
                single person to understand the competition, together with a new frontier in life science. What’s more, we
                communicate with other iGEM teams and help each other.In addition, all of the members actively organized
                various academic activities, and actively participated in disparate meetings inside and outside school to
                promote the majority of teachers and students to comprehend the field of life science, as well as to improve
                the international influence of iGEM. At the same time, it also made our team members accumulate cutting-edge
                knowledge, and provided a strong guarantee for the improvement of the subject
                </H4><H3 class="ar-title">Survey data</H3><H4>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that may exhibit chronic synovitis, synovial hyperplasia and fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, synovial fluid T, B lymphocytes and plasma cells, increased collagenase, etc. It’s a chronic disease with high morbidity. There are several new therapies that have been used for the treatment of RA, but due to low awareness and low recovery rate, many patients fail to receive a proper treatment in RA’s preliminary stage which not only afflicts the patients, but also brings a heavy financial burden to their families.
                 In China, the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is 0.2% -0.4%, so with a population of 1.3 billion, China's rheumatoid arthritis patients are expected to be around 5 million. If they cannot be given effective treatment, their mobility will be limited due to joint pain, and will eventually lead to disability. Statistically, disability rate in patients with two years of rheumatoid arthritis is up to 50% while those with three years can be 70%.
                </H4><H3 class="ar-title">Field Studies</H3><H4>To further understand a patient's conditions and the clinical status of treatment, we decided to go to Nanjing Gulou Hospital and Nanjing First Hospital to perform a questionnaire survey in the department of rheumatology immunology after beforehand investigation and contact. First is our preparation: 
                 Respondents: patients with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient in rheumatology department
                 Sample Size: 80 people
                 Procedure: 
                 1. The production of questionnaire (Avoid sensitive issues and patients’ personal information, and respect patients for their personal privacy).
                 2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
                 3. Determine the procedure and the time.
                With our planned scheduled, we went to the hospital for a two-day survey (Figure 1). We ensured the authenticity of the answers to our questionnaires. For patients with reduced mobility, our members completed the questionnaire according to their oral narration (Figure 2). We tried to gain more insights in the treatment they expected to receive, as well as the treatment they received in real life, which enabled us to feel more about the pain and suffering this disease could bring.
            </H4><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 1. Conducting a questionnaire in the Nanjing First Hospital</H4></DIV><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 2. Our teamer was talking with the patient carefully</H4></DIV><H3 class="ar-title">Questionnaire analysis</H3><H4>The following conclusions can be drawn by analyzing the data collected from the questionnaire statistically (Figure 3-5 are part of the questionnaire data) together with some supporting materials:
                 Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease most commonly seen in women aged 40-60 years old, so it is a typical middle-aged and old-aged disease, which seriously affects patients' life quality. Most patients choose drug treatments to alleviate the pain, but in actual clinical practice all currently available drugs fail to show any very significant therapeutic effect, which is why patients crave for new treatment methods. They also hope that the new method can have less side effects and lower recurrence rate, thereby reducing their pain. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis can also increase the burden on the national economy. The United States has once carried out an epidemiological survey, showing that annual cost on rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid-related treatment is more than 1% of its GDP. Though there is no such exact data in China, it is estimated that the financial loss caused by this disease is not less than the United States. As the aging problem becomes increasingly prominent, this national economic burden will become more and more heavy. If a new treatment can be designed to cure this disease radically, it will be of great significance in promoting public health and people’s health conditions.

This is a new cytotherapy that has existed for many years but hasn’t been used clinically until some recent improvement. Similar to other immunotherapies, its basic principle is to use the patient's own immune cells to specifically remove cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6, T cells are differentiated and enriched by in vivo injection of cytokines, and then the target cells are separated by cell surface markers. Next, the cells are engineered in vitro with CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor), and are amplified by cell culture to a certain number before returned to the patient's body. In this way, the engineered T cells can kill the target cells specifically in vivo.</H4><H3 class="ar-title">Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cytotherapy</H3><H4>We discussed how to design a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis during our group meeting (Figure 7) and with our advisor in depth. Eventually, based on traditional CAR-T, we chose Treg cells as engineering targets in the purpose of curing rheumatoid arthritis, and we innovatively introduced a Syn-Notch system to enhance the stability of the engineered Treg cells in vivo. We came to form a new Syn-Notch CAR-Treg system (the overall idea shown in Figure 8) after some optimization on our design. </H4><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 7. The daily group meeting</H4></DIV><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 8. The global design of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg system</H4></DIV><H3 class="ar-title">Retrospection of Survey</H3><H4>With a deeper research on treatment methods, the feasibility was verified at experimental level. But it still had a long way to go before it can be applied clinically. With our first survey results and some questions, we went to the hospital again, and conducted another questionnaire survey and interviewed some residents (Figure 9).
                 Preparation work:
                 Respondents: patients and doctors with rheumatoid arthritis at inpatient and outpatient of rheumatology department 
                 Sample size: 30 doctors and 80 patients
                 Procedure:
                 1. List a questionnaire for patients and doctors (Avoid patients’ and doctors’ personal information).
                 2. Assign teammates with different tasks.
                 3. Contact relevant departments of the hospital.
                 4. Determine the process and the time.
            </H4><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 9. Go to the hospital for in-depth investigation again</H4></DIV><H4>According to our plan, we came to Nanjing First Hospital and Nanjing Gulou Hospital for a questionnaire survey. The majority of patients showed great interests in our innovative therapy and explored the specific way of using this therapy after a conversation with them. Some patients were confident in our treatment and encouraged us to make more efforts in getting this therapy into clinical as soon as possible (Video 1). According to the survey, most of them have suffered from RA for more than 5 years. It was gratifying to note that more than half of the patients said they were willing to try Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy while others showed some uncertainty (Figure 10). But we believe this therapy will be more recognized with more future research.</H4><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 10. The personal willingness of patients to try syn-Notch CAR-T cell therapy</H4></DIV><H4 align="middle">Video 1. We have a deep conversation with patient</H4><H4>As for our survey with the doctors, most of the them have worked for more than 5 years (Figure 11), and they believed that the current drug treatment had shortcomings like severe side effects, a high recurrence rate and a chronic medication use (Figure 12), while Syn- Notch CAR Treg cell therapy had a more specific target and may show less side effects (Figure 13), which surpassed the existing treatment. Its safety was also further recognized by healthcare professionals. However, there are many problems remaining to be solved before it can actually applied clinically, such as a limitation on large-scale production, quality control standards, etc.

                with several physicians and discussed the reliability and effectiveness of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy
                with dialectical thinking.
                 In June 2017, we interviewed Ai Zhang, a senior physician who specialized in rheumatoid arthritis at the
                department of rheumatology at the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou university, who was currently studying
                at Gulou Hospital in Nanjing (Figure 15). She was well aware of CAR-T and made a lot of suggestions to us.She
                pointed out the problems in actual operation which we needed to pay attention to and all of these are very
                instructive, such as Treg in the separation of the choice of flow sorting or magnetic bead sorting problems,
                Treg training problems, etc. We also had to further develop analysis and optimization of specific experimental
                programs. Plus, she suggested that we would focus on foreign pharmaceutical giants in CAR-T and Treg and
                other clinical trials of clinical therapy, and learned from some of the lessons learned.
            </H4><DIV><H4 align="middle">Figure 15. We were interviewing Ai Zhang</H4></DIV><H4>Fortunately, we also interviewed Minning Shen, who is the associate chief physician of Nanjing first hospital
                in , Department of Rheumatology (Video 2). She was very concerned about this area and she gave a systematic
                evaluation within her point of view of the existing treatment and Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. Her views
                were consistent with the conclusions we had made in the survey, and again verified the security and reliability
                of our program from an authority expert. She also made a general prediction of the clinical application of
                Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. From the pre-basic research to the real application, Novartis's CAR-T pathways
                were significant for our application. Optimistically, Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy in the treatment of
                rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases will have a good effect.
                 Through the interview with two physicians, we received a lot of suggestions and opinions, and more of which
                was the recognition of Syn-Notch CAR-Treg cell therapy. And they were also considered Syn -Notch CAR-Treg
                cell therapy was highly viable.
