                    for me. In our team, I participated in our lab works such as the experiments of interlab study and the
                    western bloting experiments. And more, I was responsible for human practice. By those，I not only enhance
                    the practical ability and organizational skills, but also harvested the friendship. It is my honor that
                    we can make great progress together. I'm so glad to have this excellent experience working with such

                    do not hesitate to chat with me! And in the future, I want to major in biostatistics to process disease
                    or drug data for human health. So we can also talk about statistic skills. In my team, I do the aspect
                    of modeling and how our system works. It is really an amazing job! We try to use mathmatical method and
