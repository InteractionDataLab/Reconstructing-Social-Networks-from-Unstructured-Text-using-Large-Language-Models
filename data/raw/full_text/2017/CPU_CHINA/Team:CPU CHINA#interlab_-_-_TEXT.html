Overview
Reliable and repeatable measurement is a key component to synthetic biology. One of the big challenges in synthetic             biology measurement is that fluorescence data usually cannot be compared because it is reported in different             units or because different groups process data in different ways. We aim to improve the measurement tools available             to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole. Teams were given twelve test             devices of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under kit plate 6 and 7, as well as a positive and a negative control（their             location listed in figure 1）. We were asked to measure the fluorescent output of these samples using equipment             in our lab.

The CPU_CHINA team measured these samples on our Multimode Reader and reported the results to iGEM HQ for further             analysis and comparison to other teams' results before deadline（figure 2）.

1. Prepare the fluorescein stock solution:
centrifuge the fluorescein stock tube at 3000 rpm for 1 min to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube.
Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 μM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1 mL of 1xPBS.
Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution with 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution and resulting concentration             of fluorescein stock solution 50 μM (500μL of 2x fluorescein in 500 μL 1x PBS will make 1 mL of 50 μM (1x) fluorescein             solution.)

Notes: The measurement protocol takes kit plate 6 as an example. It is the same protocol, when measuring the kit             plate 7.

Day 1 : transform Escherichia coli DH5a with these following plasmids:
● Positive control
● Negative control
● Test Device 1: J23101+I13504
● Test Device 2: J23106+I13504
● Test Device 3: J23117+I13504
● Test Device 4: J23101.BCD2.E0040.B0015
● Test Device 5: J23106.BCD2.E0040.B0015
● Test Device 6: J23117.BCD2.E0040.B0015
Day 2 : pick colonies
● Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate it on 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol.
● Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
Day 3 : Cell growth, sampling, and assay
●   Set your instrument to read OD600 (as OD calibration setting)
●  Measure OD600 of the overnight cultures
●  Record data in your notebook
●  Import data into Excel ( Dilution Calculation ) Sheet_1 provided
●   Dilute the cultures to a target OD 600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel ( Dilution         Calculation ) Sheet_1) in 12 m l LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube (amber, or covered with foil to         block light).
●  Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm.
●  Take 500 μL samples of the cultures at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours of incubation. (At each time point, you will take a         sample from each of the 8 devices, two colonies per device, for a total of 16 samples per time point)
●  Place samples on ice.
●  At the end of sampling point you need to measure your samples (OD600 and Fl 485/530 measurement), (figure 5 for         details).

Interlab study results
→ OD 600 Reference point
We used LUDOX-S40 as a single point reference to obtain a ratiometric conversion factor and transform our absorbance             data into the standard OD 600 measurement (table6).
Table 1. The data of OD600 measurement
→ fluorescein fluorescence standard curve
We prepared a dilution series of fluorescein in 4 replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in the             plate reader. By measuring these in all standard modes in the plate reader, We got a standard curve of fluorescence             for fluorescein concentration (table 2 and 3).

Hereafter we measured the Abs600 and fluorescence of all of the cell samples we took. We measured the fluorescence             with the same settings as the standard modes( table4 and 5 ).

DISCUSSION
The fluorescence per OD600 of the different devices increased with promoter strength. We compare the intensity of             the promoter of the devices by comparing the ratio of the fluorescence value to the OD600 value ratio between             the samples.
→ kit plate 6
The ratio of device 1 is significantly larger than positive control. device1 ratio than the device2 about 2.5 times.             device2 ratio than the device4 about 1.4 times. And the ratio of device4 is 5 times larger than device5. device             3 and 6 are basically the same size and are balanced with negative control(Table6).
In summary, the strength of the promoter from large to small are: device1, device2, device4, device5, device3             / 6.
→ kit plate 7
The ratio of device 1 is significantly larger than positive control. device1 ratio than the device2 about 2 times. device2 ratio than the device4 about 1.8 times. And the ratio of device4 is 6 times larger than device5. device             3 and 6 are basically the same size and are balanced with negative control(Table7).
In summary, the strength of the promoter from large to small are: device1, device2, device4, device5, device3             / 6
