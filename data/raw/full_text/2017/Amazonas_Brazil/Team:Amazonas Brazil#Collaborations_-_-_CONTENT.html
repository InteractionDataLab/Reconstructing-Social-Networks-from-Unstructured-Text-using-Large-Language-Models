There, we met the new brazilian team (yay!!) from AQA-Unesp and talked with them a lot! We also met the new members of USP-Brazil 2017! This meetup gave us the possibility to also get to know some prospective iGEM teams that are bringing together to form a team and share a whatsapp group or exchange some e-mails: UFMG, UFSC and ESALQ teams. We hope to help you a lot in the next years!
 </P><H4 style="margin-top: 1em; text-align: center;"> Oxford iGEM 2017: survey, contact with Jaila</H4><P class="p" style=" margin: 1em 0 0;"> Our team translated to portuguese a survey about a new method to diagnose Chagas´ disease developed by the Oxford team during the season. This survey gave them insights of locals opinions’ if their was relevant and could be applied to the users. Besides, we gave them the contact of Jaila Lalwani, a parasitology professor at our university, so they could have a meeting to discuss about Chagas’s disease. Jaila directed them to Bolivia as the country with the highest rates of congenital Chagas. </P><H4 style="margin-top: 1em; text-align: center;"> DTU-Denmark</H4><P class="p" style=" margin: 1em 0 0;"> During this season, DTU-Denmark has been developing a method to diagnose which snake specie bit a patient. We helped them contacting the researcher Clara Guerra Duarte, who is an expert on toxicology and venomic. She gave them some ideas to their project that were used on their Integrated Human Practices. </P><H4 style="margin-top: 1em; text-align: center;">Skype meetings</H4><P class="p" style=" margin: 1em 0 0;"> To exchange ideas and use the technological tools on our favor, we had some skype meetings with some brazilian researchers and members of iGEM Foundation.
Ana Sifuentes, iGEM representative for Latin America: we talked about our Human Practices projects and she encouraged us to get more contacts with other teams that were taping videos about Synthetic Biology.
Guilherme Kundlatsch, iGEM brazilian ambassador: we talked about all of our projects for this season.
Rinaldo Pereira, a pioneer scientist on CRISPR in Brazil.  </P><H4 style="margin-top: 1em; text-align: center;">Videos</H4><P class="p" style=" margin: 1em 0 0;"> The Tübingen iGEM team had an amazing idea of collaborating with teams from around the world to produce synthetic biology tutorial videos, spreading scientific knowledge to the community on each country's national language! We also had produced our own videos, so we didn’t even hesitate and embraced this idea and shared the four videos we had made for our “Synthetic Biology 101” project. Other teams, like Aalto-Helsinki, are involved, and we are proud to be a part of this beautiful gesture of information dissemination.

You helped was a lot to understand how the importation/exportation of biological material happens in your countries and the difficulties  you faced when worked with CRISPR. </P><P class="p" style=" margin: 1em 0 0;">Biological Material Transport:

Without the E. coli strain MG1655  we wouldn’t be able to proceed our project.  Not only that, but they also gave arabinose so we could finish our experiments. Thank you for everything, USP-Brazil!

This amazing team kindly provided us this reagent so we were able to finish interlab. Wish you all the great things, AQA!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
