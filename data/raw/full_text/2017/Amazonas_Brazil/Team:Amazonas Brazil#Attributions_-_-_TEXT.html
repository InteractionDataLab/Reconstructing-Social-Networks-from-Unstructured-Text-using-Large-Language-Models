2017 has been an outstanding season for our team! We returned from 2016 Giant Jamboree full of drive to work on a new project and to gather more people to our Synbio group. So far, 2017 Amazonas_Brazil is the most numerous and diverse team we ever had. We are 16 students, 3 advisors, 2 instructors and 2 PIs from many different fields and backgrounds, such as biological sciences, biotechnology, medicine, computer engineering, biochemistry, pharmaceutical sciences, information system, computer sciences and design. Each one of us brought their  experience to make CRISPeasy what it is and being so diverse allowed us to have unique approaches in our project.
CRISPeasy wouldn’t be the same without the aid of all of these people and institutions, that guided, supported and cheered for us from the first brainstorming sessions till the wiki freeze.
What is an iGEM team without their PIs? More than just dealing with paperwork, professor Spartaco and professor Jerusa took part in the whole delineation of CRISPeasy, and a lot of what we’ve done is due to their commitment and support.
Instructors and advisors always play an important role during the project’s progress, and we would like to thank ours for being so supportive and for contributing so much with CRISPeasy.
Maria Clara, Elen and Diego, that were always available to help us during lab routine, and even spending the night in the lab during the growing curves.
Isaac and Pablo, our software mentors, that helped our software student to conceive iPROGRAm.
Denys, which guided us through the modelling of CRISPeasy.
Thanks to our sponsors we could achieve all of this! Primarly we would like to thank Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM) and Amazonas State University (UEA) for the support we received and Foundation of Research Support in Amazonas (FAPEAM) for funding our travelling tickets to attend to the Giant Jamboree.
From IDT we received an extremely important support: the building blocks of CRISPeasy, as special offer, synthetized and sent to us for free. Cristália also has always helped us by donating money, which we used to fund our reagents.
We got user license from SnapGene, MathLab and Infogram, that were extremely important to design our BioBricks, our modelling and our graphics.
We also would like to thank iTriad for supporting us as well.
Straightforwardly from Boston we received aid from SciBr Foundation that helped us to contact sponsors. Through SciBr, we contacted Serrapilheira Institute, which paid our hostage during the Jamboree.
We organized the March for Science in our city in partnership with Brazilian Society for Science’s Progress (SBPC), in the figure of professor José Wilson. This partnership helped us to come with this outstanding event to raise awareness for the importance of investments in science.
Finally, we are very grateful from the Tutorial Education Programs (PET) from the courses of Pharmacy and Design, for helping us with the design and funding of the banner.
Our gratitude also extends to iGEM, specially for the assistance and guidance we received from the Headquarters throughout this season. Thank you for making this whole experience worth it!
The following people contributed significantly to the advancement of different parts of our project, and we are so grateful to count with their assistance. During the lab work these were the awesome human beings that assisted us:
Professor PhD. Lucas Ribeiro is a CRISPR-expert, that gave us counsels about Gibson assembly and on how to design CRISPR.
Professor PhD. Rafael da Silva-Rocha taught us how to perform screen of many bacteria colonies at the same time.
Enedina Assunção presented us the principles of DNA sequencing, which we used to confirm the assemblies.
Our Human Practices also received lots of support, from specialists in biological parts transport policies to translators and revisers, we would like to thank:
Professor Carlos Gustavo gave us insight about the whole process of importing biological parts in Brazil, which was fundamental to develop the importing guideline.
Marco Antonio Pinto, representative of ANVISA, met us to discuss the current legislation regarding importing biological parts.
Matheus Costa, a law student that showed us the main aspects of transporting legislation in Brazil.
Gyorlan Alfaia, that contributed to the CRISPR study and many other things as a true iGEMer.
Mateus Picanço, Rayana Araújo and Itanei Sarah, helped us to translate and revise our texts.
Finally, we received help while programming our Wiki, so we would like to thank Paulo Victor, for solving many issues we faced during the Wiki Freeze!
