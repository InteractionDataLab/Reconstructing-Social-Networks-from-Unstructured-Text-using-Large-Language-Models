Contribution
Bronze Medal Criterion #4
Standard Tracks: Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study (to be documented on your InterLab page) and/or improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2017 part number range. Teams who are working on improving the characterization of an existing part should document their experimental design here, along with an explanation for why they chose that part to improve. Data can also be shown here, but it MUST also be documented on the part's Main Page in the Registry.
Special Tracks: Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project related to BioBricks. This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty to making and submitting a BioBrick part.
