                                We determined the main project to be the new applications of the novel fluorescent protein smURFP. We came up with 3 directions one after another to rich our project. The first is to reform the protein structure. The second is to detect BV in bird’s blood. The third is to make intestinal bacteria tracking in vivo in real time come true. To achieve these goals, we thought deeply for best arrangement. For structure and BV detection, we need purified protein and BV. For intestinal tracking, we choose surface display and co-expression for different kinds of bacteria. For solving the problem of the membrane permeability of biliverdin, we selected the surface display the target protein with the biliverdin connected outside the bacteria in anaerobes or co-express the smURFP and the enzyme, HO-1, to produce the biliverdin inside the bacteria. We first chose 7 of the bacteria, which is of vital significant in human intestine, as our research subject.

Then our group had several deep discussion about that paper and decided to send an e-mail to Dr. Liz Stanely asking for the sharing of plasmid pWW3534, pWW3515, pWW3452, pWW3535, pWW3536 and the original pNBU2, also with some questions about the RBS they use in their designs.

                                        This week we modified the previous plan. After failing for two times, we decided to try a new method called seamless cloning which main advantage is no need of digestive sites, thus it can definitely help us save a lot of time. We made two programs about constructing surface display simultaneously: one is to connect the HU-meaningless sequence-smURFP and link them into the pGH-PMB1 vector, after finishing this transformation, we finally insert the GLBP sequence into the constructed vector to replace the meaningless sequence. The other option is to connect the three segments of HU, GLBP, smURFP with overlapping regions and directly into the PGH-PMB1 vector.
