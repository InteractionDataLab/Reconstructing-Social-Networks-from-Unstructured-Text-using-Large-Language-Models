In order to make the public understand synthetic biology from more aspects, and to make our project get inspiration from a broader level, this year we carefully designed and held a variety of interesting HP activities. In these activities, we made a lot of people out of university have an impressive understand of iGEM and synthetic biological, and we introduced them our project as well as the current situation and the future of synthetic biology, and we got a lot of benefits from all of these. Here, we express our sincere thanks to those who have helped us to complete our HP activities.
