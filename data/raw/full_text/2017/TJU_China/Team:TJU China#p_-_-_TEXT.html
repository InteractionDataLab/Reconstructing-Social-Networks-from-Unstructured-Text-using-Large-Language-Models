Our Project
What component has the largest amount in human body? Cell or Gene? Neither of the options are right. In fact, it’s microbe! The number of microbes is 10 times larger than that of human cells. Only in our gut, there are more than 100 trillion bacteria, which help the body digest food, produce vitamins to prevent diseases caused by bacteria in the food and stimulate the immune system.
With the in-depth researches, scientists have founded that intestinal microbiota also plays a key role in many chronic diseases and symptoms, such as inflammation and obesity. Some other researchers also suggests one possibility that regulating intestinal microflora might treat diabetes. In addition, newest research has revealed that microbes in the gut can "command” our brains to work. There is an increasing number of evidences indicating that gut flora can really influence our thinking, mood, behavior, and feelings.
We searched for some of the most common and important intestinal microorganisms(click here to find more information) to study their functions, as well as their effects on their host. Amazed at the little creatures colonized in our intestines. For the reasons above, our team want to focus on certain kinds of intestinal micro flora, studying the interaction, location and relationship among them.
