Education & Public Engagement
By hosting Science & Education Exhibition on the White Crabapple Season Open Day in our university and having a lecture about synthetic biology and iGEM, both of which have been put into our internet wechat platform to make more public know us, our project and iGEM have been understood in a wider level.In this opening day, we designed games and introduced some biology knowledge to joiners so that they could know more about synthetic biology and IGEM, which make more people interested in microscopic life and more motivated to learn more.The lecture of iGEM to students of our university makes them know more about synthetic biology and IGEM by sharing our lab life and project and some basics of synthetic biology, which help us to establish a public dialogue from voices outside the lab. Additionally, Internet gives us a broader window to show our advantages and our project.
