Experiment evaluation</H3><DIV class="mycontent">Confocal is widely used in our experiment, but we cannot use the precision instrument whenever we want as undergraduate students. So, we need to come up with a convenience model to calculate how much smURFPs were displayed on the cell and evaluate the experiment as soon as we finish culturing.
                    The assumptions of the model are as follows:
                </DIV><DIV class="normal">
                    •	The solution of bacteria is stable;
                    •	The smURFPs move slightly;
                    •	Every bacteria produces the same amount of smURFPs;
                    •	The size of linker could be ignored compared with smURFP;
                    •	Every bacteria is at the same size.
                </DIV><H4>2.1.1. First step: calculate the concentration of smURFP</H4><DIV class="mycontent">As we all know that the production of smURFP in the cell is uncontrollable, but the result of the production of smURFP is obvious that almost the whole cell is covered by smURFP. Thus, we can calculate the amount of smURFP by following steps:</DIV><H5>a.	Calculate the surface area of the cell</H5><DIV class="mycontent">Although the shape of bacteria is various, we can abstract it to regular shapes. For example, the surface area of E.coli is:</DIV><DIV class="text-center">Figure 3 Size of E.coli</DIV><H5>b.	Calculate the minimum area that a smURFP taking on the surface</H5><DIV class="mycontent">The smURPFs are locked on the surface of cells by anchored proteins and their orientations are uncontrollable either. But in the extreme situation, all the proteins stood straightly like soldiers and their minimum surfaces were parallel to the cell. As we clearly know the structure of smURFP, we can easily know the minimum area that a smURFP taking on the surface.</DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6" style="padding-top: 252px;padding-bottom: 252px;"><DIV class="text-center">Figure 4 The structure of smURFP</DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="text-center">Figure 5 The abstraction of the structure of smURFP</DIV></DIV></DIV><H5>c.

                    •	The bacteria grow exponentially.
