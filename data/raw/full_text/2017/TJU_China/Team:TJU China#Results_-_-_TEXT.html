1. BV Detection
1.1 Standard curves
Our aim is to test the accurate amount of BV using smURFP we produced and purified. Then we get a series of standard curves of different concentration of BV and smURFP, as shown in the text-center below. Then we can use these curves to calculate how much BV is there in birds’ blood, or in other solutions.
Form the results, we found that we can get good standard curves if we use more than 15μM (15μM included) protein for detection. And from these four curves, we got a final standard curve, as shown in the figure below.
Figure. Standard curves between concentration of BV and RFU. (concentration of smURFP should be more than 15μM)

Result of Micro plate Reader in the black 96-well plate. Tube 1 and 2 are experimental group (with E.coli without plasmid), and tube 3 is the control group (with E.coli with plasmid pET28b of co-expression system).
2.3. Bacteria tracking in vitro
Escherichia coli BL21 - Co-expression
Laser confocal microscopy was use to observe these bacteria directly. Excitation wavelength is 640nm.
2.4. Bacteria tracking in vivo
Escherichia coli BL21 - Co-expression
The picture shows relative fluorescent intensity after doing intragastric administration (10^8 and 10^11 CFU) for 5.5h. The left is the control one (with E.coli without plasmid), the right is the experimental one (with E.coli with plasmid pET28b, 10^11 CFU). The result successfully showed that our system was executable and excellent. And smURFP has very compatible persistence and penetrability.
Trend of RFU in vivo. M2 is the mice with 10^8 CFU bacteria, and M3 is the mice with 10^11 CFU. We can see the fluorescence is relatively high, and the RFU is still over 3000 after 300min when the mice with 10^11 CFU bacteria.
