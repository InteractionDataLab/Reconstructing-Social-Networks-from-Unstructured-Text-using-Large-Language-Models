TJU_China for Jilin_China
We helped Jilin_China with an examination between Indigo synthesis and tryptophan. They used monooxygenase TfdB-JLU to degrade 2, 4-dichlorophenol hydroxylase and found that there is some blue matters when culturing bacteria. According to literature searched, they suspected that TfdB-JLU can catalyze benzprole or tryptophan to synthesize indigo. So we designed a test to confirm this guess.                  We cultured their bacteria in LB fluid medium. When its OD600 values reached 0.4, we divided the culture into seven test-tubes. Next, we added 0.2mM IPTG in each test-tube. Then, we added different concentrations of Trp solution, as shown in figure 1. Then we compared the color of the culture after re-incubation for 16 h. The result is shown in the picture. It is obvious that the higher concentration Trp we added, the darker the culture turned to be. Thus, we got a conclusion that tryptophan can catalyze Indigo synthesis within certain range. More Indigo can be produced with a higher concentration of tryptophan.

Jilin_China for TJU_China
We went through the iGEM teams in recent years located in China and found that iGEM16_Jilin_China’s project was about Bifidobacterium longum, which we were to use in our project this year. So we turn to iGEM17_Jilin_China, wishing to be provided the strain, promoter HU and replication origin pMB1 gene that were used in B. longum but not in stock in Biobrick part registry. Fortunately, they were genuinely excited to help us. Samples made last year (one strain and two genes) are activated, renewed and mailed to us. In return, we sent Tianjin’s special local product, 18th Street Serratula, as the gift.
