Many thanks to the following people for their invaluable help and support.
We couldn’t have done it without them!
Lab support
Clarmyra Hayes
PhD Student, SynBio CDT
Clare was there during our only (thank goodness!) midnight lab session, and went above and beyond to help us with the InterLab study, for which we will be eternally grateful. She helped with training the lab team on how to use some of the more technical equipment and also helped with the protocol for the InterLab.
Dr Estelle Dacheux
WISB Post Doctoral Research Assistant, School of Life Sciences
Aided in the experimental design of the project and with wet lab protocols. Estelle didn’t give up on us and encouraged the team to find logical solutions to seemingly impassable hurdles.
Gurdaman Singh
PhD Student, WISB
Advised on wet lab protocols, and helped with interpreting unexpected results and troubleshooting. We really appreciated the long hours that he spent supervising us in the lab, even on a Friday night!
Dr Helena Maja Firczuk
Experimental Officer, WISB
Helped with troubleshooting during wet labs and gave advice on the design of the project. Also patiently trained team members on how to use the SnapGene software.
Project Advisor Support
Dr John McCarthy
Director of WISB
Kindly provided us with lab space, helped with troubleshooting and our project design.
Dr Alfonso Jaramillo
Training & Education Lead, WISB
Our supervisor, Alfonso Jaramillo, inspired us go with a project that we are passionate about, no matter how wild it seemed on paper! Dr. Jaramillo also helped us to apply for, and secure, much of our funding at the start of the project.
Dr Emzo De Los Santos
Research Fellow, WISB
Emzo patiently guided us throughout the summer and offered troubleshooting sessions when labs weren’t going to plan. He did this despite being incredibly busy with his own research, and we are very grateful for his help and support.
Alexander Darlington
PhD Student, SynBio CDT
Modelling was relatively new to us, and so Alex advised our engineers on modelling strategies, and offered valuable help and advice when we hit any obstacles.
Website support
Lewis Hulbert
Website Engineer/Designer
Gave oversight into website development and provided substantial assistance in creating the wiki. Gave feedback and suggestions during the course of the wiki creation phase. Hosts the silent mutation Restriction Site Remover software tool. (RSremover.com)
Michael Soreanu
Website Engineer/Designer
Gave insight into website development and helped to program an open source software tool capable of inducing silent mutations in DNA sequences in order to remove restriction sites from a gene whilst maintaining the amino acid structure of a protein. (RSremover.com)
General Support
We would like to thank the members of Warwick Integrative Synthetic Biology (WISB), who provided us with invaluable feedback and advice throughout our project.
Thank you very much to Rachael Kirwan and Corinne Hanlon, who both supported us at every step of iGEM; from admin and flight-booking right through to fundraising tips. They were always on-hand to listen to our concerns and encouraged us when we needed a morale boost!
Dr. Chandrika Nair from Warwick Antimicrobial Interdisciplinary Centre (WAMIC) gave advice on the issue of antimicrobial resistance and how it would affect the main application of our project. Dr Nair also helped us in obtaining exhibition space at New Scientist Live from the 28th of September to the 1st of November.
Thank you also to anyone else who helped us along the way, whether that be lending us a pipette in an emergency or offering words of wisdom when times were tough.
All of these individuals helped to make a successful iGEM team, and we can’t thank them enough!
We thank our sponsors without whom none of this would have been possible:
