Interlab Study
How close can the numbers be when fluorescence is measured all around the world?
Goal: To establish a GFP measurement protocol based on engineering principles that anyone with a plate reader can use in their lab. Participants of the study were enlisted to produce common, comparable units of measuring GFP with different plate readers. We also tested some RBS devices (BCDs) which are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable.
We were supplied with eight plasmids containing the composite parts needed for the study. We also received a Measurement Kit from iGEM HQ, which was used to generate the standard curve needed to measure our parts.
