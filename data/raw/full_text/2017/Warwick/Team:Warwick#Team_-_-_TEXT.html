Team
There are 10 members on the Warwick iGEM team this year. Engineers from various disciplines make up half of the team, whilst the other half is composed of four from the School of Life Sciences, and one from Chemistry. Interestingly, we have members from all year groups too; from first years through to (soon to be) PhD level.
