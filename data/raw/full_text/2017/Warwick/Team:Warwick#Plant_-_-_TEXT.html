Welcome to the University of Warwick!
The Blueprint 361 system is designed to create biologically compatible implants and surface coatings, for use in the Therapeutic Industry. It does this via a novel cell-based 3D printing system: light activated amino             acids are used to control the spatial and temporal expression of genes.
