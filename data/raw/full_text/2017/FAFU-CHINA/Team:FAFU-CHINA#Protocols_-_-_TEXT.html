SDS-PAGE
1. Selection of a SDS-PAGE gel. Typically 10% acrylamide gels are used for high molecular weight (MW) proteins (20-80 kD a), 12% gels for mid range MW proteins (12 - 60 kDa), and 15% gels for low MW proteins (10-40 kDa). Load 5 ul marker or 20 ul protein sample each lane.
2. Run at 80V until samples enter the separation gel in gel running buffer (19.3 mM Glycine, 2.5 mM Tris base, 0.1% SDS), and then run at 120V. Electrophoresis is complete when the dye front migrates about 2 mm from the bottom of the gel..
3. Stain with Coomassie brilliant blue for 1 h, and then destain in destain buffer (50% H2O, 20% AcOH, 30% methanol) for 1h.
Test protein production
1. Prepare an overnight culture inoculated with B. megaterium single colonies from a plate (medium including antibiotic such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol) grown 14 h at 37 °C while agitation at 100 rpm.
2. Inoculate fresh medium with overnight culture in a dilution of 1:100.
3. Grow the recombinant B. megaterium cells in baffled flasks to an optical density (OD578nm) of 0.3 - 0.4 at 37 °C under vigorous shaking (250 rpm).
4. Take a sample as control before induction.
5. Induce the xylose inducible promoter by addition of 0.5% (w/v) of (D)-xylose.
6. Incubate at 37 °C with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm.
7. Withdraw samples every 30 to 60 minutes for OD578nm-measurement and protein analysis (up to 6 hours after induction). For extracellular protein analysis take 2 ml of cell culture. Intracellular protein analysis requires a higher volume than 2 ml of sample.
8. Centrifuge each sample to harvest cells and cell free supernatant.
9. For extracellular protein analysis store the cell free supernatant at 4 °C, and for intracellular protein analysis completely remove supernatant and freeze the cell pellet at -20 °C.
Analysis of intracellular proteins
1. Resuspend cells in 30 μl of lysis buffer.
2. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C while shaking at 1,000 rpm in a thermomixer. An effective cell lysis can be obtained by whirling the samples every 10 minutes.
3. To separate insoluble fraction (pellet) from the soluble fraction (supernatant), centrifuge cell lysate for 30 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm.
4. Mix 27 µl of supernatant containing soluble proteins with 13 µl of SDS sample buffer.
5. Completely remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 30 µl of 8 M urea (w/v). Centrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm.
6. Mix 27 µl of the supernatant with 13 µl of SDS sample buffer.
7. Heat each sample for 5 min at 95 °C.
8. Load 7.5 µl of each sample onto an SDS-PAGE gel.
Protoplast preparation
A preculture of B. megaterium  was grown overnight in 50 mL SMMP on a shaking platform (100 rpm) at 30 °C for a maximum of 16 h. SMMP (50 mL) was inoculated with 1 mL preculture, incubated at 37 °C, and shaken at 200 rpm until an OD578 of 1.0 was reached (~2 h).Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,683 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 5 mL SMMP. Lysozyme (100 μL 5 mg mL−1dissolved in SMMP and ﬁlter sterilized) was added and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 100 rpm for 10–20 min until at least 50% of cells were protoplasts (as estimated by use of a light microscope). Protoplasts were incubated on ice for 30 min and then harvested at 1,400 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 5 mL SMMP.This process was repeated three times to remove excess lysozyme. After the ﬁnal resuspension in 5 mL SMMP, 652.5μL 100% glycerol were added and mixed. Aliquots (500 μL) wereprepared and used fresh or stored at −80 °C (viable for 2 month).
Transformation protocol:（tet 10ul/ml）
1. Combine 500 μl of protoplast suspension and 3-5 μg of plasmid DNA in a 15 ml tube, one for each transformation. DNA should be purified using a commercial preparation kit. Elute the DNA from the column using water.
2. Add 1.5 ml of PEG-P, mix gently, and incubate for 2 minutes at RT.
3. Add 5 ml SMMP and mix carefully by rolling the tube.
4. Harvest cells by gentle centrifugation (1,300 x g for 10 minutes at RT), discard the supernatant immediately after centrifugation. Supernatant does not have to be removed completely.
(Note: do not check for a cell pellet - most of the time it will be invisible)
5. Add 500 μl of SMMP to remaining supernatant (containing bacterial cells) and transfer to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
6. Incubate at 30 °C for 90 minutes with gentle shaking or rolling of tubes (max. 100 rpm) or incubate for 45 min without shaking followed by another 45 min while shaking at 300 rpm.
7. Prepare 2.5 ml aliquots of CR5-top agar in sterile tubes.
8. After incubation at 30 °C add all cells to 2.5 ml top agar, mix gently by rolling the tube between both hands (do not vortex!), and pour onto a pre-warmed plate of LB containing desired antibiotic.
9. Incubate overnight at 30 °C - expect colonies of varying diameter because some will be covered with agar and others have easier access to air.
(Note: bacterial colonies on the top of the agar surface will be shiny)
10. Streak several single colonies (at least 3) on fresh plates within two days.
Suggest:
1. Negative control: protoplasts without DNA
This is a test reassuring that the protoplasts are not only fully viable but also free of contaminations before using them for transformation. Perform this test according to the transformation protocol as demonstrated below. After incubation at 30 °C, apply CR5-top agar to the protoplasts and split the sample in two portions. You may plate one sample on a LB plate with antibiotic such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol, and another one on a plate without any drug. In this case, bacterial colonies will grow only on a solid medium without antibiotics.
2.Positive control: protoplasts transformed with an empty plasmid
This is a test control for a successful transformation and should yield lots of colonies on the plates supplemented with an antibiotic (here: tetracycline or chloramphenicol). If this transformation works well, but you have problems with the plasmid containing your target gene, the problem is most likely associated with your construct.

5. Induce the xylose inducible promoter by addition of 0.5% (w/v) of (D)-xylose.
6. Incubate at 37 °C with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm.
7. Withdraw samples every 30 to 60 minutes for OD578nm-measurement and protein analysis (up to 6 hours after induction). For extracellular protein analysis take 2 ml of cell culture. Intracellular protein analysis requires a higher volume than 2 ml of sample.
8. Centrifuge each sample to harvest cells and cell free supernatant.
9. For extracellular protein analysis store the cell free supernatant at 4 °C, and for intracellular protein analysis completely remove supernatant and freeze the cell pellet at -20 °C.
Analysis of intracellular proteins
1. Resuspend cells in 30 μl of lysis buffer.
2. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C while shaking at 1,000 rpm in a thermomixer. An effective cell lysis can be obtained by whirling the samples every 10 minutes.
3. To separate insoluble fraction (pellet) from the soluble fraction (supernatant), centrifuge cell lysate for 30 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm.
4. Mix 27 µl of supernatant containing soluble proteins with 13 µl of SDS sample buffer.
5. Completely remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 30 µl of 8 M urea (w/v). Centrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm.
6. Mix 27 µl of the supernatant with 13 µl of SDS sample buffer.
7. Heat each sample for 5 min at 95 °C.
8. Load 7.5 µl of each sample onto an SDS-PAGE gel.

Sample collection and treatment of plant
We contacted the teachers of the College of Resources and Environment to learn how to handle samples. With the help of teachers, we determinated the content of Cd/Pb by AAS
1.Immerse 15min in 20mmo1/L Na2-EDTA to remove the heavy metal adsorbed on the root surface
2.Dry and crush sample with smash meter with 120℃ for 30 mins,then turn to 65℃ for 8hours
3.According to the quality of the sample after grinding,transfer the sample and 6ml mixed acid（HNO3：HClO4＝5：1） into 50ml flask to heat in the electric heating with 120 ℃ for 8 hours
4.Cool and move sample into 15ml capacity bottle, and constant volume to mark line.
5.Take the Clarification solution after filtering flocculent by 0.45 nm filter
6..Measure the contents of Cd /Pb in deferent kinds of agrochemical by AAS
7. Data analysis
Determination of Heavy Metals in Fertilizers
The determination of the total amount of Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd was digested with HNO3-HClO4,
The sample was pulverized with the pulverizer,
A sample of 1.00 g of each sample was weighed into a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask
B. Add 6ml of mixed acid (HNO3: HClO4 = 5: 1) and mix well,
Placed in the hot plate on the low temperature to produce a large number of white smoke,
The solution was yellow and then cooled,
Add a small amount of water,
Boil to remove residual nitric acid to produce white smoke.
C. repeat the treatment twice, let them let the cold,
Into the 250ml volumetric flask,
The residual liquid in the flask is washed and set to a graduated line.
After dilution, the solution contains floc, filter, take clear solution.
