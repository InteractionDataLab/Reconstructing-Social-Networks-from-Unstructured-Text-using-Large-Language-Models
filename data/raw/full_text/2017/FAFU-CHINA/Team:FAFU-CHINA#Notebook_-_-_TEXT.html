2017.05.28-2017.06.03
We collected a lot of soil samples from all over the country, hoping to screen out the bacteria with the ability to dissolve phosphorus. Firstly, we put half of the samples into organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus medium for culture.
2017.06.04-2017.06.10
During the screening of bacteria, total four soil samples, respectively, 37th, 38th, Beishan area, Chinese garden soil and soil samples. Phosphorus enrichment in organic and inorganic found even filtered process 37, 38th samples did not see obvious phenomena of dissolved phosphorus, observed only yellow mucus-like plaque. Stored too long, speculation, and dry, less solubilizing bacteria, strong colony survival and stress resistance (yellow mucus-like plaque), a type of bacteria in less dissolved phosphorus under low phosphorus environment to survive. 37, 38th, soil samples failed. Found in the Beishan screening of soil samples, the only obvious solubilizing, labeled a, its propagation and flat dash found solubilizing effect, as one of candidate species for further experiments. Therefore, crossed the plate picked up three colonies, numbered A1, A2 and A3, respectively, on the inclined plane of bacteria and propagation in preparation for the molybdenum blue Colorimetry. Screening of Chinese garden soil samples found in phosphate, then pick the better of the two colonies (numbered b, c) a flat line, but the result is not ideal c, pass. B the results still can, collect a bacteria retention and propagation in preparation for molybdenum blue Colorimetry. Direct pick the bacteria found in the process of picking fungi in repeated experiments, pick the number of bacteria will not, lead to very different results.
2017.06.11-2017.06.17
Then we did the plate scribing, and picked out a single colony with phosphorus solution, measuring its 16SrDNA to identify it.
Finally, we found Bacillus megaterium.Genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial isolates using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, DNA was stored at −20℃. Two universal oligonucleotide forward and reverse primers were synthesized based on the standard 16S rRNA gene sequence. The primers used to amplify the 16S rDNA samples were
forward primer:
-5’-CCGAATTCGTCGACAACAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3’.
and reverse primer:
-5’-CCCGGATCCAAGCTTACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’.
PCR Amplification.
10x PCR Buffer            5μL
10x dNTP                  0.5μL
Forward Primer            1μL
Reverse Primer            1μL
Template               1μL
Taq DNA polymerase        1μL
Sterile distill water     up to 50 μL
PCR
initial denaturation at 95℃ for 3minutes which was followed with 35-cycle consisting of denaturation at ℃ for 30 seconds, annealing at 60℃ for 30 seconds, and elongation at 72℃ for 2minutes.The reaction was completed with an extension step at 72℃for 5 minutes. All samples were removed from the thermal cycler and stored at −20℃. The PCR product was determined by electrophoresis with loading 8 l of PCR product on to 1% agarose gel.
2017.06.18-2017.06.24
Considering stability and efficiency of subsequent genetic tranformantion, we bought strain from microbial and inoculum company and then cultivated the Bacillus megaterium strain from first generation to seventh generation on egg medium.
2017.06.25-2017.07.01
We continually cultivated the Bacillus megaterium strain from seventh generation to fifth generation on egg medium. However, we still didn’t find any signs of degradation of the ability to dissolve phosphorus. So we gave up the screening.
2017.07.02-2017.07.08
The growth curve of Bacillus megaterium was measured in beef extract peptone with different lead concentration. gradient
2017.07.09-2017.07.15
The growth curve of Bacillus megaterium was measured in beef extract peptone with different cadmium concentration gradient.
