It’s FAFU_CHINA third time to participate in iGEM. Compared with other practised and proficient teams, we are a newly established team, still at the very beginning stage of exploring the basic conception, principle and method of research on synthetic biology. This year our team consists of senior students who have at least one-year experience on molceular biological related field and freshman students who have inextinguishable passion for synthetic biology while lack of lab experience. Past two-year participating experience has taught us that reciproal and efficient cooperation and clear responsibility management are essential for us. This year our project have focused on enviromental problem——Heavy metal pollution, and come up with a brand new and eco-friendly method aiming for cleanup metalliferous soils which used genetically engineering tool on Bacillus megaterium.

Hao Feng
He is a junior student of Bee and one of the student advisors of 2017 FAFU-CHINA iGEM team.
Students
Fangfei Niu
She is a senior student majoring Horticultural Molecular Biology and responsible for lab, human practice, wiki and other affairs related to our team. During the past one year, she came to know the charm of Synthetic Biology. While her life is not all about science, she is also obsessed with art and guzheng.
Yi Cai
He is a junior student majoring in Agronomy and studies in a molecular biology lab.This year he is vice-leader of team.His main works are experiment,data processing and wiki editing.He has grasp of data analysis tools and doing molecular experiment.In   spare time soccer and cycling are his favorite hobbies.
Yue Qiu
She is a member of art design group. She helps the group to illustrate their process and result on wiki and poster and take photographs to record process during the experiments.  She also work on hp，and Work part-time in experiment group.
Size Cai
He is studying plant science and technology. In the team, he filtrated out the strain which has the ability to dissolve phosphorus, and measured the growth of the strain under metal stress. Extroversion is his characteristic. His biggest dream is going to be legen... wait for it...dary ,legendary!
Yanbing Hou
She studied at the College of Life Sciences, which is a field full of magic.In the team she has screened microorganism with the ability to dissolve phosphorus ,and she also tried the electric transfer of the Bacillus megaterium. Later, she participated in the biometric and fertilizers  test of  the experiment .
Haiyang Chen
His name is Chen Haiyang, and you can call him ocean.He is a freshman at the School of Life Science at Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.He is mainly responsible for interlab, gene synthesis design and docking with biological companies. At he same time, He takes care of tobacco and hold some tasks in CCiC.
Wei Shi
His speciality is plant protection, and he likes to find the joy of life in the challenge. Again, because the challenge made him more eager to meet the better people. iGEM gave him a chance, and made him try harder to do what he was interested in. He always believed that as long as he worked hard, he still had a chance.
Weshan Tu
Weishan Tu is a sophomore majoring in life sciences with special interests in synthetic biology and botany. He focuses on the work related with molecular cloning ,transformation on Bacillus megaterium. Besides, he loves playing badminton and enjoying cooperating with teammates. He's willing to make friends and exchange ideas with iGEMers all over the world.
Yujie Chi
Yujie is an outgoing girl who likes to make friends with others, majoring in the Plant Protection.   In the team, she is in charge of the biology test and manages the expenses of the team.In her spare time, she is crazy about the sports, especially badminton and volleyball.
Linlin Zheng
Lin Lin is a sophomore student who is studying in fujian agriculture and forestry university college of life sciences, she specializes in the biological sciences, And she is responsible for the construction of the wiki and layout design in team, she likes  reading books and playing guitar in her spare time.
Xizhen Wu
His name is wu xi zhen.He is 21 years old.His major is engineering management.In the 2017 FAFU-CHINA iGEM team , he is responsible for establishing mathematical models.His motto is: "don't walk behind me, I may not go."Don't walk in front of me, I may not go.Walk beside me and be my friend."
Xiaojiang Li
Responsible for the team's wiki production, likes the chess painting and calligraphy. The longing for the unknown and the mystery is the power source for its scientific exploration.
Zheyuan Yu
