This is an improve part.This gene is a cold resistant gene from the Arctic cryophile Polaribacter irgensii.It can largely increase the cold resistance of bacterias.CDS sequence optimization in ( BBa_K538004 ) is better suited for expression in Bacillus megaterium and we add a 6*His tag at the C end.After that, the promoter ( BBa_K143012 ) and RBS ( BBa_K090505 ) were combined.
