Fudan University: We partnered up with Fudan University to complete the Interlab. Since our school’s plate reader was unable to measure fluorescence, Fudan University’s iGEM team was kind enough to let our team use their lab and borrow their plate reader. They provided us with all the necessary lab materials and instruments needed to complete the study. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation for all the members on the Fudan iGEM team for providing us assistance on the Interlab.
