We saw this as a massive problem because the minimum age for drinking in China is 18, which means that most college students would be able to drink. This then leads to students our age most likely being amongst those individuals who would be most affected by this, since fake alcohol usually tends to be cheaper and would sound like an attractive offer to college students who were trying to be financially responsible.Thus, we took it upon ourselves to dedicate some time to educating some of our peers at NYU Shanghai about the dangers of fake alcohol and how to be smart when it comes to drinking. </SPAN></P><H1 class="c8 c15" id="h.441ohm4uj9y"><SPAN class="c5">Community Outreach</SPAN></H1><H2 class="c8 c10" id="h.fwumb0eh56b"><SPAN>Alcohol Awareness Week : May 15</SPAN><SPAN class="c18">th</SPAN><SPAN>- May 19</SPAN><SPAN class="c18">th</SPAN><SPAN>, 2017</SPAN></H2><P class="c8 c11"><SPAN class="c4 c3">We set up a station on campus at NYU Shanghai.
