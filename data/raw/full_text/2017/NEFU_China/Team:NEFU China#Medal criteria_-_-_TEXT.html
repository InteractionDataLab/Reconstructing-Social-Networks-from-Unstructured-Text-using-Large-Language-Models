Medal criteria
1. Team NEFU_China has registered the 2017 iGEM with great enthusiasm.
2. We have created a wiki webpage of our team with clear attribution of each aspect of our project.
3. We have successfully improved the performance of a previously existing BioBrick BBa_K103006 and BioBrick BBa_J32015.
1. We have created BBa_K2302008, BBa_K2302009, BBa_K2302003, BBa_K2302004, BBa_K2302005 and BBa_K2302006 that work well in our project. These BioBricks have been documented in the Registry entry.
2. We have helped Nanjing-China team, HFUT-China team and NKU_China team to examine the functional activities of their biobricks. For more details, see our Collaboration part.
3. We propagated our project to the public, especially to the students, to enhance the general understanding of Genetically Modified Organismo in the human practices. We have attached a summary of the importance of our waste grease treatment project to public perception. Please check the human practice page in our wiki.
1. We have extended our human practice activity through integrating our research questions into questionnaires to students and organized several debating competitions on the topic of waste grease pollution among different universities and labs. We collected the ideas and suggestions from these activities regarding how to treat waste grease efficiently.
2. We have successfully improved the performance of a previously existing BioBrick BBa_K103006 and BioBrick BBa_J32015.
3. We have established a model for decomposing fat efficiently to learn the optimal treatment time and concentration of the Follower D. Please check the page of modeling in our Wiki.
4. Our BioBrick devices work well under conditions of our lab.
