    To confirm the system can work properly, we needed to verify the theory that these two types of bacteria “Follower D” and “Follower E” have chemotactic response to serine but show anti-chemotactic response to leucine. Therefore, we created a device consists of needles and capillary tubings (made of medical plastic) (Fig. 5A). First, to confirm the optimal chemotactic time of serine, we put the capillary tubings with different concentrations (0, 10<SUP>-6</SUP>, 10,<SUP>-5</SUP>, 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, 10<SUP>-3</SUP>and 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M) of serine into bacterium suspension for 10, 30 and 60 min, and then determined the bacterium numbers in the tubings. The results indicated that serine reached the highest chemotactic effect at 30 min (Fig. 5B). Thus, we used this time point (30 min) for all subsequent experiments.   </P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Figure 5.

As showed in Fig. 6A, the colony numbers increased as the concentration rose (Fig. 6B).  </P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Figure 6. The colonies formed on plates (A) and the colony-forming unit (B) at different serine concentrations. </STRONG></P><P>    To confirm this result by another approach, we also used flow cytometry to determine the amounts of bacteria in this experiment. Consistent with the results obtained above, the numbers of bacteria counted by the flow cytometer also increased in proportional to the concentration of serine (Fig. 7A and B). </P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Figure 7. Flow cytometry analyses of bacteria in chemotaxis experiments (A) and the quantitation of bacteria at different serine concentrations (B).</STRONG></P><P>    In the experiment to examine the anti-chemotactic effect of leucine, we used the “leucine-mixed-with-bacteria” method instead of “serine-in-capillary” method. We first mixed bacteria with different concentrations of leucine and then inserted capillaries containing regular medium (without leucine) into these bacteria. This experiment is based on our assumption that bacteria in leucine-containing medium should escape and move into these capillaries without the repellent for “refuge”. We then determined the amounts of bacteria in the capillaries by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 8A, the amounts of bacteria in the capillaries significantly increased as compared to the control group. Moreover, the increasing tendency of bacteria displayed a leucine dose dependent manner. The data suggested that leucine exerts repellent effects on bacteria.  
Furthermore, we mixed serine with leucine to test whether serine can exert dominant effect over leucine to attract bacteria, which is the key design of our system. As shown in Figure 8B, in the leucine-treated group, increasing concentrations of serine can remarkably increase the amounts of bacteria in capillaries, and reached to a peak in the 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M serine-treated group (Fig. 8B). In addition, in the 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M serine-treated group, the numbers of bacteria were significantly higher in 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M leucine-treated group than 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M leucine-treated group (Fig. 8B). It suggested that high levels of serine can attract a lot of bacteria in medium with different concentrations of leucine.</P><P style="text-align: center;"><STRONG>Figure 8.
