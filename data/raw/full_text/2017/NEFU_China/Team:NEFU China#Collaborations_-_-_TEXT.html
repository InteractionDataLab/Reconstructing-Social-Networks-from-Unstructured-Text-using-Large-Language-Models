Collaboration with Nanjing_China
This year, our iGEM team has developed cooperative relationship with the Nanjing-China team. We have reached an agreement of helping each other examine the effectiveness of biobricks.
Firstly, we excised the EGFP cDNA form pEGFPN2 vector using restriction enzymes KpnI and NotI. Secondly, we inserted this cDNA into a vector pHisx6 that is commonly used for prokaryotic expression vector.
The bands appeared at 720bp, equal to the predicted length of EGFP coding sequence. This gel graphic indicates that we had successfully excited EGFP cDNA. Then, we transformed the recombinant vector into E. coli. We observed green fluorescence from the transformed E. coli under a fluorescence microscope.See more details (Nanjing_China)
Collaboration with NKU_China
This year, our iGEM team has developed cooperative relationship with the NKU-China team. We have reached an agreement of helping each other complete the construction of the carrier.
Firstly, we excised the pelB-CALB cDNA from pEGFPN2 vector with NdeI and BamHI. Secondly, we inserted the sequence into the pHisx6  vector. The bands located at 1,000bp, equal to the length pelB-CALB coding sequence. This gel image indicates that we had successfully cloned pelB-CALB. Then, we transformed the recombinant vector into E. coli.
Collaboration with HFUT_China
This year, our iGEM team developed cooperative relationship with the HFUT-China team. We have reached an agreement to help each other complete web design.
We first helped them resolve some software problems and test the functionality of the software. They also helped us complete the upload of our web page and provided us with helpful suggestions.
