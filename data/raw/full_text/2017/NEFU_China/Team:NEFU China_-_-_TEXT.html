In the nature, almost all organismal species have their own social divisions.
Based on this phenomenon, our team developed a novel grease-degradation system consisting of differentially engineered microbial groups.
Our system can be divided into two groups, “Leaders” and “Followers”. The Leader group acts as a command center and a reaction center, and  the follower group plays a role of collecting substrates.
In this case, our team takes waste oil and grease processing as the task to illustrate the feasibility of the social division in our engineered microbial society, and provides a novel idea for future research in sewage treatment.
