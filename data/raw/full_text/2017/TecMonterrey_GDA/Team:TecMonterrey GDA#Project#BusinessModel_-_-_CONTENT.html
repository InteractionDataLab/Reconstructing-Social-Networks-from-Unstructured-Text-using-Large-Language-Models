We achieved to mapped 7 actors in this kind of relationship but for practical uses we are going to use this diagram.</P><P>So basically our business model works like this, the tequila industry generates waste that is the bagasse, they are going to give us the row material that is necessary for PHA production. In order to save money, we want that the factories send us the row material, taking advantage that they already pay for managing that waste, replacing that waste translate it to transportation cost for them but with the difference that we are going to offer a profit from the final utility, that would be very interesting for the tequila industry because the are going to be able to generate a passive income from an actual cost, they are going to generate money from their garbage, who will not be interested in doing that?, i will!</P><P>After that we have another important actor, our Plastic Producers and something really interesting happens here, the plastic production industry is a well established industry, so they are accustomed to do the things the old fashion way, so to disrupt this industry we are going to enter with the actors that already have the infrastructure offering pay-per-sale contracts, so they are going to pay us for the bioplastic they sell. This way we are going to produce just what they needed, lean manufacturing, doing this we are going to save costs for the stock and the equipment necessary to process the plastic.</P><P>This will allow us to capitalize us with a low risk and gradually buy the necessary equipment to process the PHA we generate.</P><P>The final objective is to satisfy the demand of two very important zones of restaurants in our city, one use plastics because of the quick degradation characteristic that our plastic have, forks, spoons, bags, (la cosa donde guardas la comida que no se como se diga en ingles), this is interesting for restaurants because after using PHA’s they could show themselves as environmentally responsible enterprises that basically is having a good image.</P><P>Lastly, government is supporting this kind of initiatives, in méxico there is a law that textually says “ To avoid that in the transportation, containment and packaging of materials, as well as in the management of solid waste, non-biodegradable materials are used” so we could interact with them and to work together for help them to achieve their environmental objectives, in exchange of exposure or grants for the project.</P><A>http://www.plastico.com/temas/Nuevas-leyes-sobre-uso-de-empaques-plasticos-en-Latinoamerica+3076641</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
