Team members
The PHAgave 2017 team believes in international cooperation as the best mechanism of growth, success and evolution, therefore, we have built up a team that meets this belief.
Our team members are Biotechnology Engineering students from Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara. Most of them are also members, founding members and/or part of the Youth Biotech Headquarters; an international youth association that focuses on science communication, science regulation and science development. It was born last december, as well as this iGEM team, during the UN Biodiversity Conference in Cancún, Mexico. Today, it has presence in 15 different countries.
Our team instructors and advisors come from different parts of the world; like Panamá, Germany and the United Kingdom; or have been involved with international institutions such as Stanford, McGill University, University of Edinburgh, The Global Biotech Revolution, and of course, have a vast experience at iGEM as team members, team leaders, instructors, members of the Latin American committee or delegates.

Yo Suzuki, Ph.D. - Advisor
Yo Suzuki is an Assistant Professor in the Synthetic Biology and Bioenergy Department at the J. Craig Venter Institute, which he joined in 2010. He earned his Ph.D. in molecular biology from the University of Colorado for his work on a C. elegans TGF-b gene. He soon became interested in the multi-gene genetic interaction problem. As a postdoctoral fellow he identified genes that act in parallel with a C. elegans homolog for the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. Later, he switched to yeast and developed the “Green Monster” method for multi-locus engineering in Fritz Roth's lab at Harvard Medical School. In this method, GFP-marked genomic alterations are assembled into a single genome through repeated rounds of mating, meiosis and flow-cytometric enrichment of yeast cells harboring the alterations.
