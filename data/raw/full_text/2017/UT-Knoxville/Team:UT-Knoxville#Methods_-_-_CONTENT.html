The autoclaved media was cooled using a 50˚C water bath, after which 10 mM MgSO<SUB>4</SUB> was added. The media was divided into 180 mL portions in 250-mL flasks, and we added ampicillin at various concentrations [3, 4.5, 6, 9 μg/mL]. 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol was also added to the media. The various media was mixed briefly in the 37˚C shaking incubator. The media was poured into miniature petri dishes, labeled, and stored at 4˚C for several days prior to the experiment.

The following morning, the cultures were diluted to OD=1.0 with sterile 0.9% v/v NaCl water. OD=1.0 was diluted serially by factors of 10^2, 10^4, and 10^6. 5 μL droplet of each cell count to one quadrant of the plate via micropipette.
