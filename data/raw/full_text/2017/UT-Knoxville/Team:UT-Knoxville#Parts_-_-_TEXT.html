Submitted Parts
Parts Collection
UT-Knoxville 2017 has submitted the following parts:
The xylR coding sequence was synthesized during our 2016 project, and the Pu promoter was amplified from 2013 Peking’s part BBa_K1031803. All constructs were made by Gibson Assembly. Confirmed sequences of these parts are available on the registry.
Each gene of interest was amplified from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA, and Gibson Assembled into a linearized vector consisting of pSB1C3, BBa_B0034, and BBa_B0010. The constructs were first transformed into Top10, and characterized and sequenced in BL21DE3. Confirmed sequences of these parts are available in the registry.
Note: pRob (BBa_K2451006) remains BioBrick incompatible due to EcoRI and PstI in the coding sequence.
