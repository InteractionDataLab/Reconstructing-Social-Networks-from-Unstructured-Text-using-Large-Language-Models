Interlab Study
Interlab constructs were transformed between 7/26 and 8/7.  Although well-used transformation practices were employed, green fluorescence was not seen on plates, in liquid culture or after characterization.  Because this was used as a teaching tool for our younger members, this was not noted at the time.  Frozen stocks were made of each construct.  For characterization, one frozen stock and one plate colony were grown on 9/17, and characterization and calibration procedures were followed.  No GFP was observed at all.  Due to time constraints with troubleshooting our main project, transformations could not be repeated.  After emailing iGEM HQ, we were told to still post our results and given credit for our efforts.
