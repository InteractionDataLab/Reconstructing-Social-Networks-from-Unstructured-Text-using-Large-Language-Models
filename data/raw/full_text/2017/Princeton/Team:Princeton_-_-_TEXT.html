Our Current Project
Our project this year deals with the Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly microbiome, and engineering a microbe to introduce to the fly gut. We aim to use the Drosophila gut as a model to develop general techniques for engineering gut microbiota. Use the menu options to see more detailed information about our work!
