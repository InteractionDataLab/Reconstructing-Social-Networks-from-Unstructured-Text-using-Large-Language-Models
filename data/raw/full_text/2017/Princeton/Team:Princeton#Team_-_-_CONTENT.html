Originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh, I have been living in Folsom, California for about 8 years now. A junior in the Chemical and Bioengineering Department, I joined iGEM because it was a fantastic way to work with my peers who were just as passionate about biotech and create something together. In my spare time, I love drawing and sketching -- in fact I have just begun a crazy art project where I am sketching all of my favorite paintings, people, and places to plaster all over my wall. Fun fact about me -- I was bitten by a monkey while hiking in the Sundarban Forest in Bangladesh when I was 8.</P></DIV><DIV class="spec-member member-cont" id="helen"><H2>Helen Park</H2><P>My name is Helen, and I’m a junior in the Chemical and Biological Engineering Department. I hail from Rockville Maryland -- that just so happens to have the largest indoor rock-climbing gym in the nation, a favorite hobby of mine. Other things I do in my spare time include painting, furniture/jewelry making, photography... anything crafty really. I’m in iGEM to put all the class-work and lab experience we’ve gained to good use, and because I wholeheartedly believe we as a team can design something innovative and valuable to society. A fun fact about me: I have a complicated relationship with hot tubs.</P></DIV><DIV class="spec-member member-cont" id="ifunanya"><H2>Ifunanya Nwogbaga</H2><P>My name is Ifunanya Nwogbaga and I am currently a junior in the Chemical and Biological Engineering program at Princeton University!

I joined iGEM because I was interested in bioengineering and biotechnology and I wanted to get experience developing a new project using the things I have learned over the years. For me, it was a way to put my knowledge to good use without it having to be some boring government job but instead a cool, innovative project! What I like to do for fun mostly is run, do Taekwondo, and draw! A fun fact about me is that I have almost 100 cousins!</P></DIV><DIV class="spec-member member-cont" id="alev"><H2>Alev Baysoy</H2><P>My name is Alev Baysoy and I am a junior in the CBE department at Princeton. I am from St.Paul, Minnesota and I decided to join iGEM because I wanted more experience in the biological side of engineering (as chemical and biological engineering are clumped together as a major) as well as gain more experience in the application of the engineering work that I do to industry and I feel that iGEM is a great liaison for this. I want to pursue a career relating to bioengineering and biotech, and am really excited to work on a meaningful project in the lab. My hobbies include running, cooking, crossfit, and travelling. A fun fact about me is that I am a dual-citizen with Turkey.</P></DIV><DIV class="spec-member member-cont" id="matt"><H2>Matt Wang</H2><P>My name is Matt Wang, and I’m a sophomore in the Electrical Engineering department at Princeton University. I’m from San Jose, California. I’m in iGEM because I’m interested in biodevices, both the lab work and experimental inquiry and the electronic instruments that allow bioengineered organisms to be practically used outside of the controlled confines of the lab. Through our endeavors, I hope to gain lab experience, and also a better understand of the workflow of creating novel technology. Outside of iGEM, I also enjoy singing and cooking, and a fun fact about me is that I share my bed with eight stuffed animals.</P></DIV><DIV class="spec-member member-cont" id="allyson"><H2>Allyson Brown</H2><P>Hi, my name is Allyson, and I am from Santa Maria, California.  I am a junior Chemical and Biological Engineering major, while pursuing a certificate in Engineering Biology. I have been intrigued by the field of genetic engineering since high school, and after learning more about it in college, I joined the Princeton iGEM team.  Apart from iGEM, I enjoy taking ballet classes, playing piano, and baking chocolate chip cookies in my occasional free time.  Fun fact about me: I have not eaten a banana for at least 8 years; I despise bananas.</P></DIV><DIV class="spec-member member-cont" id="andy"><H2>Andy Liu</H2><P>My name is Andy Liu and I am a sophomore in the Chemical and Biological Engineering department. I am from Shanghai, China, but I went to high school in Concord, NH. I decided to join iGEM because it is a good way for us to apply the knowledge we’ve learnt in class to do something exciting.
