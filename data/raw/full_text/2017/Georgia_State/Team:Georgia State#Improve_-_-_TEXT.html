"Attempt the impossible in order to improve your work."
Bette Davis
hCG
In our search for a recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) beta subunit plasmid, we found that the part BBa_K732001 from UVA was not codon optimized. Our attempt to express this part in E.coli failed. We have instead found the cDNA sequence of the beta-subunit from Strausberg, R.L. et al and used it to improve the part.  Thus, we were able to add the new improved part to the registry and this will allow for other teams to be able to work with a functional part with the optimized codon. Our new part BBa_K2524000 could ideally be used to express hCG and be detected at low concentrations with a pregnancy test.
