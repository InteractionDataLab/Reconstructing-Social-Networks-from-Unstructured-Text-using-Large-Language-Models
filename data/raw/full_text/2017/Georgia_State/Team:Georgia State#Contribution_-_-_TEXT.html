Georgia State 2017 Measurement Study
This year we decided to conduct a large-scale measurement study to ascertain an optimal growth medium for high protein yield in ''Escherichia coli''. The study utilized the following parts transformed into Neb5-Alpha competent cells:
BBa_I20270
BBa_R0040
BBa_J364000
BBa_J364001
BBa_J364002
BBa_J364003
BBa_J364004
BBa_J364005
Liquid Media
The experiment included four types of liquid media which varied in nutritional complexity.
2x YT Broth
LB Broth
Terrific Broth
Super Rich Broth
Once transformed, the controls and test devices were cultured according to the 2017 Interlab protocol. Each media trial consisted of two replicates of each device and control. After six hours of monitored growth, the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of all the samples were measured with a BDFACScanto flow cytometer. Finally, the MFIs for each device were compiled and compared with FlowJo software by media type.
Results
Mean Fluorescence Intensity measured by flow cytometry of GFP expressed from 6-hour cultures of BBa_I20270 in multiple growth mediums.
Mean Fluorescence Intensity measured by flow cytometry of GFP expressed from 6-hour cultures of BBa_R0040 in multiple growth mediums.
