Objective:To determine if Alkaline Phosphotase will bind to nitrocellulose paper and produce a signal when mixed with BCIP.
Materials:Cut small strips of nitrocellulose paper (Nitran), Promega Alkaline Phosphatase (Conc: 1ng/ul), Alkaline 10X buffer diluted, BCIP
Equipment:UV-Crosslinker
Procedure: See attached procedure.
Results: The Ap spread outward but stayed confined meaning the crosslinking worked. Adding the BCIP solution to the tube with the paper produced a noticeable discoloration. Adding the enzyme to the BCIP only produced a small discoloration. The binding of the alkaline phosphatase and BCIP to the paper was successful. The reaction worked only in the intended areas meaning that if the AP is bound to the factor c it may produce a signal only if it is cut, the AP nor BCIP disperses in the solution after being bound to the paper.

PCR of factor-C gBlocks
Objective: Factor C was divided into 4 G-blocks and ordered from IDT. A PCR was performed to add overlaps to each block so that subsequent overlap extension PCRs could be performed.
Procedure: See attached protocol.
Results:
A simulated gel was created and then the actual sampled of each were run on an e-gel. 5ul of product with 1ul of 6X dye and 14 ul of DI water was added to each well. The wells include the following from left to right: Gene Ruler 1kb DNA ladder, PCR of g-block 1, PCR of g-block 2, PCR of g-block 3, PCR of g-block 4.

Ligation of hCG and PSB1C3
Objective:To ligate hCG and PSB1C3
Materials: digested vector cleaned by Cara Jones, T4 ligase and buffer,  digested hCG
Procedure: Using a ligation calculator the concentration needed was 31.87 ng/ul in a 20ul total ligation. 1ul of PGEX at 105 ng/ul and 6 ul of hCG, 2 ul of T4 buffer,  1 ul of T4 ligase and 10 ul of nuclease-free water. A negative control was used which included digested mamba in pgex with no ligation buffer. The ligation reaction sat at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Transformation
Objective:To transform the ligation of hCG and PSB1C3
Materials:C2987I NEB competent cells, ligation reaction
Equipment:shaker and incubator
Procedure: See attached procedure.
Results:There was no growth on the ligation plate nor negative control but there was growth on the positive control. Since there was no growth on the ligation plates that would mean the cells have no resistance to ampicillin and the ligation was inefficient due to the fact the hCG was not purified to eliminate contaminants ike EDTA and salts.
