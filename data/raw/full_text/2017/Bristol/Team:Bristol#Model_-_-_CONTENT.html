        Our team produced two main models to inform on the design of our project and to simulate areas that we could not test practically. The ambitious nature of our project meant that there were a number of areas that can be supported by modelling, as we did
        not set out to have a fully working prototype pod over the short summer, and these models will be of use to any future work on our project. The modelling aspect of our project was also one of the most interdisciplinary, with the engineers working
        with the biologists on a directly overlapping subject. This required a lot of learning on both sides, as well as compromises (with the engineers encountering just how limited biologists are by the vast unknown at the biochemical level, and the
        biologists learning just how much engineers love numbers)!

Thus, we were able to obtain rates for the conversion of nitrite and nitrate (i.e. dissolved NOx) to ammonia specifically within
            our system containing bacteria that are overexpressing the enzymes. An overview of this model is given below:</P></DIV><DIV class="fadeIn"><P class="lead Up">The GRN enabled us to model the production rates and extent of Nrf and Nap. The concentrations of both enzymes are able to be predicted when the rates of transcription, translation and degradation (of both mRNA and protein) are known. Because
            our construct included an IPTG-inducible promoter, the concentration of IPTG was relevant and therefore also had to be considered.</P><P class="lead Up">Having obtained enzyme concentrations from our GRN or estimating them, the next step was to model the kinetics of these enzymes within a cell. Modelling the enzyme kinetics involved understanding of differential equations, and the derivations
            are listed in the <A target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/e/eb/T--Bristol--ModellingSupplement.pdf">modelling supplement PDF</A>. This model takes initial concentrations of all substances present and rate constants as inputs;
            a sample result is given below (note the values are arbitrary).</P></DIV><DIV class="fadeIn"><P class="lead Up">Given this model, we then searched the literature extensively for all the constants we required. With valuable correspondence with Professor Julea Butt (of the University of East Anglia) we were able to obtain some values for the required
            constants (Kcat, Kd and Km) for both enzymes, however we found that these values came from conflicting sources using very different measurement techniques, rendering them of little use for our modelling. Equally, we were unable find any values
            for the Kcat and Kd of Nap. Listed below, however, are the values we were able to find:</P></DIV><DIV class="fadeIn col-md-12"><P class="lead team"><I>*Value obtained is in Paracoccus pantotrophus, E. coli values being absent in the literature</I></P></DIV><DIV class="fadeIn"><P class="lead Up">There are a number of factors that could influence the system that we have not incorporated in the model. These include the rate of uptake of nitrate/nitrite into the periplasm by the cells, but E. coli are equipped to do this and we assume
            that this will not be rate limiting. We are also assuming that ammonia produced will diffuse out of the cell and not be toxic; E. coli are tolerant of fairly high ammonia concentrations. If the ammonia did begin to be toxic to the cells, a
            future amendment to pod design could be to actively remove ammonia from the bacterial component to be fed into the fuel cell.</P><P class="lead Up">The combination of the GRN (giving us enzyme concentrations) and the enzyme kinetics (giving us the rates at which our substrates (nitrite and nitrate) are converted to product (ammonia) provides the information required to establish the capacity
            of an E. coli cell to metabolise NOx, i.e. the single cell model.</P></DIV><H2 class="featurette-heading">Future work</H2><DIV class="fadeIn"><P class="lead Up">In future the single-cell model could be scaled up to a population model, such as Bristol iGEM 2008’s software BSim. Within such an agent-based model, each &quot;agent&quot; would represent a bacterium overexpressing our enzymes, which degrade NOx as
            per the enzyme kinetics equations. Rules can be added to each cell to define its viability in the presence of the overexpressed enzymes or of ammonia, as well as longevity and random efficiency.</P><P class="lead Up">This population model can be fed with data from the atmospheric model – i.e. accurate NOx concentrations in the city of Bristol - to enable us to simulate the entire system that would be contained within a pod, assessing efficiency, nutrient
            requirements and other factors that would influence pod design, such as the necessary size of the pod, as well as the prediction of problems that may arise. This enabled a more realistic simulation of how efficient our pods would be in a real-world
            setting.

Currently there are no citywide NOx measurements to compare this data with but, there are a couple air quality
          measurement stations in Bristol. Overall the results from the atmospheric modelling were surprising, with the level of NOx concentrations being similar to levels recorded at the Bristol, St. Pauls measuring station [7]. The concentrations are
          still on the low side with only some areas reaching the levels that have been recorded previously in Bristol. It can be seen that the pollution builds up when there are many neighbouring roads. This means that NOx concentrations from outside
          the computation area is being neglected and the calculated levels are going to be lower that they should be.</P><P class="lead">The diffusion coefficient caused a lot of issues regarding the stability of the numerical solution therefore, the timestep and change in distances had to be altered to provide stability at the loss of smoothness in the solution.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><P class="lead">The model was able to satisfy most of the original aims set out in the beginning. The NOx levels were predicted to within a reasonable accuracy compared to measured data. Real traffic data along with engine emissions data were used to create succesful
          estimates of the source values used in the simulation inputs. Results also show areas of high NOx concentrations depending on the wind conditions which can be used to strategically place pods with the aim of reducing pollution. We were not able
          to assess the impact our pods would have in removing pollution. This was due to not having sufficient modelling and lab data to accurately predict how much the pods would clean up.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><P class="lead">In going forward with these results there are a couple of things we would like to address in the future. The most important is getting data for our pods and inputting it into the simulation so we can build a picture of how effective these pods
          will be once placed in strategic areas. In order to create a more accurate model it would be good to refine the data used to create the source values. Instead of generalising the traffic data it would be better to apply it to each individual
          road seperately. As well as having a distribution of different engines with different emissions standards instead of solely choosing the Euro IV standard. This would require a lot more time and data processing which is why it was not covered
          during this project. Lastly the computational area needs to be increased to capture the entire Bristol area. This will require more computing power or the grid resolution will have to be lowered in order to run the simulation in a reasonable
          amount of time.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row fadeIn"><DIV class="col-md-12"><H4>References</H4><P>
