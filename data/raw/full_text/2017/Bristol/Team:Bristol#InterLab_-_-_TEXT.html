Interlab Study
Come together, right now.
Our team took part in the Interlab Study as part of the Bronze Medal requirement. The aim of the Interlab study is to enhance reliability and repeatability of experiments in different labs. Participating iGEM teams around the world all undertake the same         set of experiments - measuring fluorescence of green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is widely used in synthetic biology - but measurement techniques and other analytical aspects of the process differ and so direct comparisons and collaborations         between labs can be challenging. The development of a measurement protocol (for the use of anyone with access to a plate reader) that has been standardised would therefore be highly valuable for synthetic biologists around the world.
The Interlab Study was a great place to start in the lab for us. We were able to do most of the work whilst we waited for our DNA to arrive, and so once it did we were fully acclimatised to the lab and more comfortable with techniques at the beginning         of our main project.
