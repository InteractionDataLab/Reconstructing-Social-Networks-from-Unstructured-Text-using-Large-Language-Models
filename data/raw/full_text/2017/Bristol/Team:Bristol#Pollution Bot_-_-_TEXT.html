Pollution Bot
*Beep Boop*
Pollution Bot was created with the aim of bringing real time live pollution data into the public's grasp. Using Twitter allows people to share their pollution levels and to start a conversation about air pollution. The data is sourced from the OpenAQ         database who believe in open access to air quality data to empower the public to fight air inequality. Pollution Bot received many tweets and gave information about pollution around the world.
