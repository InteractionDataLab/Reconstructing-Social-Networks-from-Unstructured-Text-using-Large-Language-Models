iGEM Development Environment (IDE)
Internet Explorer: Number one browser for downloading other browsers.
IDE is a useful tool we have created to make Wiki editing easier and faster. We initially found Wiki editing to be slow and frustrating, as previewing or uploading Wiki pages on the iGEM website after making only small changes takes time. IDE allows         local development of your Wiki; the Wiki page is recreated locally on your computer, and edits can be viewed quickly just by refreshing the page. Once your Wiki page is finished, the code can easily be uploaded to the iGEM website.
More information about how to download and use IDE can be found on GitHub .
Many teams used our IDE software to help them develop their Wiki, and gave us feedback so that we could improve the software. A list of teams and the feedback they gave can be found on our Collaborations page.
