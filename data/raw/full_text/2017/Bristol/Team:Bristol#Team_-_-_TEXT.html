The Team
Don't worry, they won't bite!
Here in Team Bristol this year, collaboration is at the core of how we operate. Our team is as interdisciplinary as it gets, with a group of only nine people flying the flag for seven different subjects - ranging from Biology to Aerospace Engineering to Chemistry and History. Every single aspect of our project is a multidisciplinary collaboration. Engineers and our Historian assist our Biochemists in the lab; our Cellular and Molecular Medic assists in the Engineering workshop; and everybody participates in Human Practices and outreach work, with our Chemist and Historian working together to coordinate our exciting and variegated efforts. There are no preconceptions or prejudices. Anybody can participate in any aspect of the project in which they are interested. This fosters creativity and imaginative problem-solving, and ensures that there is a passionate momentum behind all that we do. We are loving the whole iGEM process and very grateful to be a part of it!
Nick Comben
Biology
A 3rd year Biology MSci student, I joined the Bristol iGEM team to gain more practical experience in a project which is both challenging and aims to tackle an important global issue. I am excited to further my knowledge of molecular biology and gain an           understanding of modelling, programming and how the scientific community can better communicate with the public. Outside of iGEM I enjoy playing football and going to the gym.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: coronation chicken sandwich, tuna mayo sandwich, rocky road and pineapple and passionfruit ribena.
Sarah Cooke
Biochemistry
I’m a 4th year Biochemistry MSci student with particular interests in (in addition to synthetic biology) infectious disease and cancer biology. I joined the iGEM team because I get to spend my summer doing both the science I know and love and learning           new skills outside of my degree, and applying all of this to help tackle world health and environmental issues whilst hopefully improving public perception and understanding of controversial topics such as genetic engineering.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: can’t commit, variety is key.
Phoebe Dace
Cellular and Molecular Medicine
I’ve just graduated after studying Cellular and Molecular Medicine with a year in industry, which I spent working at GSK in Protein Degradation. I wanted to join iGEM to have a fun summer in Bristol, learning about synthetic biology and engineering bacteria           to make the world a better place. When I’m not at iGEM I enjoy playing tennis, baking and playing piano.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: I save £3.50 per day by going home for lunch.
Sarah Deegan
Clinical Science
Hello I’m Sarah! I’m a Clinical Science MSc student, interested in tissue engineering and synbio applications to biomedical and environmental challenges. iGEM is such an exciting opportunity to be a part of an interdisciplinary team, combining our abilities           to tackle a meaningful synbio project. I’m enjoying learning new skills, challenging what I know and potentially creating something useful in the process! When I’m not at iGEM I love growing plants, playing cello and making sure I have the latest           software updates.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: without fail - kefir, falafel & houmous, and watermelon.
Ben Hardy
Biochemistry
I’m Ben, a 4th year Biochemistry MSci student. Taking part in iGEM is a valuable opportunity to contribute to the rapidly growing world of synthetic biology, while tackling important world issues. I’m excited to engage with teams from all around the world,           and strengthen the collaborative aspect of synthetic biology. Outside of iGEM, I enjoy playing guitar, recording music and swimming.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: vegetable and lemon pasta, carrots and hummus, Rhubarb Cawston Press, fresh covfefe.
Jérémie Joannès
Aerospace Engineering
I’m a final year Aerospace Engineering student, specialising in Space Systems and with a great interest for space biology. I love interdisciplinary work, so iGEM is really exciting for me! I’m looking forward to learning about genetic engineering, lab           techniques and chemistry, and getting involved with the local community. Outside of iGEM I like making rockets.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal:  Co-op’s most fine carrots and houmous, couscous, ginger beer (£3.50).
Jonathan De Oliveira
History
Hello! I’m a History BA student about to enter my final year and a wannabe future medical doctor (stranger things have happened). I’m loving iGEM because it is allowing me to get the most out of my University experience. It has enabled me to speak to           a fantastic variety of people with so many different sets of expertise and ways of thinking through problems. I’ve also been able to visit and use parts of the University which I never would have otherwise - from helping to transform bacteria           in the labs, to laser cutting MDF in the Engineering workshop. In my spare time I enjoy reading medical history, cycling and cooking pesto pasta.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: falafel and houmous wrap, granola bar and Innocent Super Smoothie (the red one).
Billie Schlich
Chemistry
Hi! I’m Billie, I’m a 3rd year Chemistry MSci student, a captain in the Bristol Jets cheer squad and the team’s social media addict! I applied to be in the Bristol iGEM team to be a part of a community committed to saving and protecting the world. I’m           really excited about developing some useful modelling skills as well as getting involved in the public engagement as I love meeting new people.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: Co-op falafel and houmous salad, edamame beans with soy sauce, Purdey’s rejuvenate.
Albert Wigmore
Aerospace Engineering
A freshly graduated Aerospace Engineering student with a passion and specialisation in Space Systems Engineering. I joined the iGEM team to learn about the exciting field of Synthetic Biology and how it could be utilised to make the world a better place.           After iGEM I will be working in the space industry for a satellite communications company. My interests are space, programming and food.
Favourite lunchtime meal deal: chicken and avocado sandwich, pineapple and coconut yoghurt and Dr. Pepper.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good...
