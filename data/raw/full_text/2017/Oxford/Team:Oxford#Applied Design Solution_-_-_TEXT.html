Current Kit
Our current kit meets our criteria established from our 4E’s framework: it is effective, easy-to-use, economically viable and environmentally safe. A prototype version was designed using CAD software and 3D printed.

Review of our kit by healthcare professionals
We presented our prototype model to two healthcare professionals in order to re-evaluate our current kit. Recommendations gathered would be implemented into the future versions of our kit.
Mrs Sarah Dragonetti (Registered Nurse)
Findings:
Flat, rectangular pipette hole fits well
Timestrip would be a useful tool during busy periods
Good size and good shape - feels intuitive
A window would allow you to see whether the pipette was emptied, preventing someone from accidentally drawing blood back up
A red case would make it difficult to see the blood through the window, so white or translucent casing would be better
Unclear on actual device when to click together the two components
Unclear whether pipette should stay in kit or be taken out (and when)
Dr Ben Riley (General Practice)
Findings:
Kit is sealed so no worry about blood containment
Ideal cost should be comparable to a one-use diabetes test strip (~£3)
Size and shape is good for packaging and transport
Distinctive shape will make it easy to identify
These were very useful comments: they support some aspects of our current design, but also propose some changes which would further improve the end-user experience.
Overall recommendations:
Make the case transparent: prevents pipette errors but is more cost-effective than a window
Make the key instructions as clear as possible, and include these within the kit
Evaluate the cost of the device (which we have presented below)
