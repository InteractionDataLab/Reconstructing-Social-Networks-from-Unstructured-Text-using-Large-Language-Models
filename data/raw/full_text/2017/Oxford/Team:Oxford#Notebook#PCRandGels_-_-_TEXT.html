Introduction
We used the online resource Benchling to help keep an account and organise all the Wet Lab work that was conducted over the summer. We created a separate lab book for each major stage of the process, and each step carried out was linked to the protocol and tagged to the person who performed the task. This was helpful for tracking progress and troubleshooting.
