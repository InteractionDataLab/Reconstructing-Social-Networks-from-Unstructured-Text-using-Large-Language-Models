Chagas Public Policy
To optimise the integration of our device into society, we researched the current political, social and economic landscape in our case study country, Bolivia. We worked closely with the Centre for Health and Emerging Technologies (HeLEX) to propose a set of guidelines designed to fill the gaps and evaluate the findings from the National Congenital Chagas disease programme in Bolivia (2004-2009). Please find our policy brief attached below.
