Software Tool
The design of our rapid diagnostic kit enables it to act as a platform technology, wherein the input and output can be altered to detect a wide range of parasitic infections. We envisage our project being able to pave the way for quick, cheap, and unambiguous serological testing that does not dependent on antibody detection, making it ideal for immunocompromised patients as well as any diseases that lack antigenically detectable biomarkers. We have created a simple software tool to aid the expansion of our platform technology, we aim to make the software open source to allow continual addition of the diseases and their protease-based biomarkers and consequently ensure the tool remains date with the the most recent research.
Enter the disease name, parasite or specific protease to find the cleavage sequence of protease specific to the disease of interest and how our system may be applicable.
