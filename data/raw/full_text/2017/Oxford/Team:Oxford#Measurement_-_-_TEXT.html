Measurement
We have developed a lightweight, user-friendly MatLab tool that is able to extract relative quantitative data from microscopy images. Current systems include software such as ImageJ which although more comprehensive, require further training for effective use. Specifically, most software suites only focus on cell segmentation in phase contrast images, with very little support for differential interference contrast (DIC) images. We have developed a MATLAB tool that can quickly and automatically pick out cells in a DIC image. We have tested this system with our microscopy data, and has saved us a large amount of time in data analysis.
