Sponsors
We would like to thank our many sponsors without whose support our project would not have been possible
Oxford Departments
The Department of Biochemistry's support has been essential to our project; they have provided matching funds for each biochemistry student in addition to the lab space we used for our project.
We would also like to thank the departments of Engineering Sciences, Medical Sciences and Zoology for their additional financial support.
Oxford Colleges
Each of our colleges provided us support towards our summer accommodation during our project and towards our travel, which greatly aided our project.
Pro Vice-Chancellor Discretionary Fund
We received funding from the Pro VC Discretionary Fund, for which we are very grateful.
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council sponsored our living and lab costs.
Eppendorf kindly provided us with P10, P100 and P1000 pipettes, and microcentrifuge tubes which significantly improved the efficiency and smooth running of our wet lab.
Snap Gene kindly provided us with licences for in silico part building and cloning.
The Rokos Scholarship is a scheme run by Chris Rokos through Pembroke College, Oxford, and is available to STEM students studying there. It provides accommodation, living costs, and laboratory costs to students awarded the prize. One of our team-mates received this general scholarship to take part in iGEM.
Microscopes Services Ltd has 50 years of experience in the sales, service and repair of microscopes, cameras, software and accessories across the UK. The company generously provided financial assistance for our project.
NEB gave us restriction enzymes and reagents for our wet lab cloning.
Integrated DNA Technologies provided us with 10,000bp DNA for us to use to rapidly synthesise our constructs.
Twist Bioscience is a San Francisco based company offering a silicon-based DNA synthesis platform for medicine, agriculture, industrial chemicals, and data storage applications. We were winners of their competition obtaining financial assistance for our project.
BMG LABTECH is a leading global manufacturer of innovative, high-quality, and reliable microplate reader instrumentation. They kindly provided us with black, clear bottomed 96 well plates, that allowed us to perform Fluorescence and Absorbance measurements simultaneously. They also gave us an in house demonstration of the plate reader.
