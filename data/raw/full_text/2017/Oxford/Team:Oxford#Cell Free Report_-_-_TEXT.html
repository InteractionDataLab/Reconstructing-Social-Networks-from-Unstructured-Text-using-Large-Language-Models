Cell-Free Report
When researching cell-free techniques and technologies, we were hit by a lack of information regarding its use in the field. With guidance from the Centre for Health and Emerging Technologies (HeLEX) amongst others, we created a report detailing some of the current regulations and some aspects we thought needed addressing. Please find this report below.
