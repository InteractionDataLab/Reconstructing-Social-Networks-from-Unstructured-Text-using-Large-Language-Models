Initial Ideas
Possibilities
During the initial development phase, we had many ideas for the direction in which we could take an iGEM project. We have detailed some of them below.
Idea
Pros
Cons
Disco Yoghurt - yoghurt that changed flavour upon exposure to different colour lights
Fun (would get to eat yoghurt)
Easy to generate monochromatic light
Bacteria respond to light already
Not really a â€˜real world issue'
Would take a lot of work to generate different receptor/response regulator pairs
Fe. coli - absorbing iron in the gut to aid people who cannot absorb iron well; eg pregnant women
Easily applicable real world problem
Can follow and build on the work of previous iGEM teams
Lots of methods already exist to increase iron levels - why would synthetic biology be the one solution?
Circadian rhythms - modifying circadian rhythms with the aim of having a temporal release of a drug without having to remember to take it
Currently a very popular topic (see recent Nobel awards)
Could work as a foundational advance or as a therapeutic when applied
Very complicated topic!
Would first have to recreate the rhythm in E. coli before attempting to perturb it. Hard to validate.
Curli yoghurt - A yoghurt with a peptide that has emerging clinical value for patients with IBD
Access to a group of patients to survey, through team member
Clear real-world problem
Involves a currently-developing treatment - very relevant
Clinical trials may disprove the benefits of curli
May be hard to produce the complex peptide in E. coli
Hard to model
Biofilm plasters - Using biofilms to our aid to absorb pathogens that would otherwise infect a patient and may cause sepsis
Clear real-world problem
Clear applied design
We have good access to hospitals for research and advice
Hard to control a biofilm in the lab
Biofilms not well-enough understood to know obvious sites for perturbation
We decided on a synthetic biology diagnostic device with the aim of creating something which was modular and adaptable. This is because it has a clear real-world application, a clear niche for synthetic biology and a clear want from the public ( as discovered by our survey ). This meant it was the perfect place from which to develop an iGEM project.
Our next task was to decide on a case-study disease to properly direct our project towards a real-world problem. Read more about our case study, Chagas disease, here .
