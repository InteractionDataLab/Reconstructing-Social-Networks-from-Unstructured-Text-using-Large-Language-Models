Register and Attend
We have registered for iGEM and are excited to go to the Giant Jamboree after a great summer!
Deliverables
We have designed a wiki to display the work that has gone into and come out of our project.
A project attributions page is included in our wiki; this contains information on how team members and additional advisors contributed to our project.
We have created a poster and presentation to show at the Giant Jamboree.
We considered important aspects pertaining to the safety of our project and submitted the relevant iGEM safety forms.
We have completed the judging form .
Our parts are documented in the Registry. Find a list of them with links to their Registry pages here !
We submitted our Parts following the guidelines outlined by iGEM.
Attributions
A project attributions page is included in our wiki; this contains information on how team members and additional advisors contributed to our project.
Characterization/Contribution
We participated in the InterLab study! Find more information here .

Validated Part/Validated Contribution
We created a novel part consisting of pTET, the strong BBa_B0030 RBS , and eYFP. Our modelling demonstrated that a strong ribosome binding site (RBS) would be necessary to minimize the rate of false negatives produced by our diagnostic device. Our characterization of this part and its RBS are shown here .
Collaboration
We participated in bi-directional collaboration with multiple teams over the summer! A summary can be found here , with links to more specific examples throughout our wiki.
Human Practices
We considered the safety, environmental impact, and public reception of our diagnostic device. Steps taken to better understand these features and improve our design accordingly are documented in the safety , applied design , and human practices pages of our wiki.
Gold
Integrated Human Practices
Human practices shaped the design and execution of our project from its conception, beginning with a survey to the public about what area to focus our efforts in. Throughout our project we continued to interact with experts, stakeholders, and industry members to create a diagnostic device appropriate for the setting of implementation and its purpose.
Improve a Previous Part or Project
We improved the BBa_K1319002 REACh2 dark quencher. We used this part in a fusion protein, which includes the TorA leader sequence, SpyCatcher, superfolder GFP, a TEV cleavage site, and a His Tag fusion protein. Our data (registry) demonstrates the ability of REACh2 to quench fluorescence (i) of superfolder GFP (which is stable e.g. in the periplasm and OMVs), (ii) in the presence of a His tag (which is important for protein purification purposes) , and (iii) when (indirectly) attached to a TorA leader sequence, which may target the fusion protein to the periplasm.
Model your Project
We continuously modeled many aspects of our project and the results shaped the direction of project. The models we created and their integration with our project is documented in the ‘Dry Lab’ section of our wiki.
