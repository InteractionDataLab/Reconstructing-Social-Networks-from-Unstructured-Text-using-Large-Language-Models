Our Team
Our team, made up of 11 high school students,
has gone through many tests, as we all started with a small foundation of freshman Pre-AP Biology. Through from the hot days of summer to the crunch times in October, each member has dedicated their time and energy towards the project in order to make it work. Due to the common goal and the amount of time we have spent together, this team is closer then we would have ever otherwise been.
