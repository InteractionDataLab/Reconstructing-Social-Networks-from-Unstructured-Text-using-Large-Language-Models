Acid-resistant Microparticles
To make probiotics as a good food supplement, one may consider the engineered microbes need to pass through gastric acid in the digestive system. Calcium alginate nanoparticles are good carriers for delivery which are acid-resistant (pH=2) and releasing in basic environment (pH=9). The following is our protocol in the microencapsulation process.
Microencapsulation
Make 0.25% alginate: 0.25 g of Alginic acid sodium salt (SIGMA-ALDRICH) in 100 ml of H2O. Heat at 100°C and cool down to ~37°C.
Add E. coli (1x109 cells/ml) expressing GFP in the 1% alginate.
Make 2% CaCl2: 10 g of Calcium chloride (SIGMA-ALDRICH) in 500 ml of H2O
Use a dropper to aspirate the 1% alginate containing bacteria and drop slowly into 2% CaCl2.
Incubate for 30 seconds and pick up the micro-spheroid particles carrying bacteria.
 
 
Test in Acidic and Basic Environment
Make solutions of pH=7, pH = 2, pH=9 to mimic esophagus stomach intestine environment, respectively.
Put ~30 micro-spheroid particles carrying bacteria into 50ml of each solution
Keep at room temperature for 4 hours
Take 100ul to one well of 96-well plate and measure GFP at Ex/Em=485/528nm with a BioTek microplate reader.
Spread 100ul onto agar plates. Grow at 37°C overnight and count the numbers of colonies.
 
 
Results
  The GFP values are higher in pH=7 and pH=9 compared to pH=2.
  1071 colonies grew on agar plates from the solution of pH=9. But there were not any colonies surviving from the solution of pH=2
The data above indicated that the micro-spheroid particles may release the microbes which survive in an environment of pH=7~9.

Simulation With Prototype
 
 
We   designed   a   cable   car-like   device   to   simulate   food   (capsule)   entering   and   passing   through   the   human   digestive   system.   By   the   environment   it   has   to   stays   like   mouth,   stomach,  intestinal   tract,   and   how   long   it   will   stay,   we   ensured   that   our   capsule   will   be   released   only   in   the   intestinal   tract   rather  than   breaking   down   in   unintended   areas   (Too   early   or   too   late).   What’s   more,   this   device   is   not   designed   only   for   our   project.   It   can   be   used   to   test   any   other   kinds   of   capsule   easily   by   simply   changing   the   substances   in   the   liquid   and   the   operating   time   of   the   cable  car.
Design
Figure   1   Liquid   container
We make Acrylic Sheet a box and a cover with holes. The container is separated into three sections── neutral(mouth), Acid(stomach), and Alkaline(intestinal tract). The holes on the cover are to avoid the liquid inside splitting out, but the size of them are designed to let a capsule get through exactly.
Figure   2    NXT  LEGO track   device
We chose NXT Lego to build the cable car track above because of its simplicity and creative. Put the cable car-liked device on the cover and start the program.Soaking the capsule in the liquid orderly, and decide how long we soak the capsule according to the time food stays in the Digestive tract.

User Guide
Our cable car-liked device is simple and safe for anyone to use. User only have to do is hang the capsule which waiting for detection on the transport carriage, and push the start button on the core(the orange one). Then observe the result patiently. It can show us when will capsule break down and release medicine. It can also test various pill by just adjust the solution in the container or the time the capsule soak in solution.
