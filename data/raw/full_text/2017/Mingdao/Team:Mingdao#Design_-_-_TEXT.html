Framework
 
 
We   designed   a   cable   car-like   device   to   simulate   food   (capsule)   entering   and   passing   through   the   human   digestive   system.   By   the   environment   it   has   to   stays   like   mouth,   stomach,  intestinal   tract,   and   how   long   it   will   stay,   we   ensured   that   our   capsule   will   be   released   only   in   the   intestinal   tract   rather  than   breaking   down   in   unintended   areas   (Too   early   or   too   late).   What’s   more,   this   device   is   not   designed   only   for   our   project.   It   can   be   used   to   test   any   other   kinds   of   capsule   easily   by   simply   changing   the   substances   in   the   liquid   and   the   operating   time   of   the   cable  car.
Design
Figure   1   Liquid   container
We make Acrylic Sheet a box and a cover with holes. The container is separated into three sections── neutral(mouth), Acid(stomach), and Alkaline(intestinal tract). The holes on the cover are to avoid the liquid inside splitting out, but the size of them are designed to let a capsule get through exactly.
Figure   2    NXT  LEGO track   device
We chose NXT Lego to build the cable car track above because of its simplicity and creative. Put the cable car-liked device on the cover and start the program.Soaking the capsule in the liquid orderly, and decide how long we soak the capsule according to the time food stays in the Digestive tract.

User Guide
Our cable car-liked device is simple and safe for anyone to use. User only have to do is hang the capsule which waiting for detection on the transport carriage, and push the start button on the core(the orange one). Then observe the result patiently. It can show us when will capsule break down and release medicine. It can also test various pill by just adjust the solution in the container or the time the capsule soak in solution.
