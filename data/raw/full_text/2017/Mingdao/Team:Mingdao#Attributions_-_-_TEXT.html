Thank You to those who have helped us
Participating in the iGEM competition is never an easy mission. Along the path, there are always ones who helped us whenever we are disoriented. Experts and teachers, doctors and students in the campus who supported our events, and most profoundly, our PI, we would like to thank you for the bottom of our hearts at this glorious moment.
ATTRIBUTIONS
Instructor
Dr. Phil (Pei-Hong) Chen
I’m an iGEM lover beginning at NYMU-Taipei team as an instructor thru 2011 & 2012. I started to be a primary PI for Mingdao iGEM High School Team in 2014. That year, we are one of the first HS teams from Taiwan to join iGEM. I completed my education with a PhD degree in Microbiology & Immunology at College of Medicine, National Taiwan University in 2008. From then on, I love gene cloning and viral vector construction and always think how to improve the skills and apply to the real world. I’d also like to educate undergraduate school students to open their mind in biotech and let their imagination to come true through Synthetic Biology. iGEM is a really nice place where people meet and inspires each other. We're happy to see you there.

Drink Sampling
It is always not easy to hold activities at school, especially events requiring massive resources and manpower. Thank you to all those non-iGEMers who helped us complete such a hard work. Thank you to all the participants  who came to our presence. Also, let us show our special appreciation to the kind Dou-Dou-tea tea shop owner who offered us a HUGE amount of drinks for free. Though the event  wasn’t as perfect as we had expected, we still made a significant growth of popularity for the word ”IGEM” among students. What we’ve done in Mingdao is surely unprecedented.
