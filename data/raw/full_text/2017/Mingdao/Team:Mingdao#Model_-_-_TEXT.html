To estimate how our product will function the best, we analyzed the data we got from the experiments. First of all, conducting the glucose uptake experiment, not only did we find the relation between time and the percentage of glucose absorbance, but proved that the engineered E.coli work perfectly. Additionally, we also carried on an examination to see whether the acid-resistance capsule containing bacteria dissolves in an alkaline environment, representing intestine. With the results we got from the above experiments, we can tell how much probiotic consumers should take depending on the amount of sugar contained in the food.
As the figure shown below, we can see that the E.coli with PTS transporter had better performance on glucose absorbance. By the time of 4 hour, 1 ml of bacteria can absorb approximately 3.3 mg of glucose per hour, which is the highest efficiency.
With the data from the experiment, we can calculate how much glucose can a gram of engineered bacteria absorb:
The average time food being absorbed in small intestine is about 5 hours, which means each gram of E.coli we engineered could absorb 2g of glucose when in small intestine.
According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of China, people can calculate how much calorie (unit:kcal) should one get every day (depending on BMI)  with the formula below.
According to World Health Organization (WHO), the amount of sugar one consume should be less than 5% of recommended calorie each day. Then, we can calculate how much sugar does the bacteria need to absorb when having different kinds of food and drinks. The following figure shows how much bacteria should one take in order not to become fatter depending on the food or drink. (We took a 175cm high man for example)
As shown in the figure, for example, if you are a man whose BMI is between 18 and 24, you should eat about 4 grams of the engineered bacteria before having a scoop (141g) of chocolate ice cream so that the bacteria can absorb the extra glucose, which prevents you from getting fatter. However, we can also see that the lower your BMI is, the more bacteria you should take before a meal. It’s because the function of our product is to prevent people from gaining more fats instead of making people thinner. As a result, if an obese person wants to get fitter, he or she should not only use our product, which makes the fitting process easier, but also do exercises regularly.
