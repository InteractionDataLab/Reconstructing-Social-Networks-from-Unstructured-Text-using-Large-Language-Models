Interlab
In order to meet the requirement of bronze medal, our team conducted the Interlab Study experiments, including transformation, serial dilution and florescence measurement, etc. Throughout the Interlab Study, we not only learned the concept of accurate measurement but also improved our experiment skills, which is a great preparation for us before our project get started!
