2016.12.06-2017.2.16
We attempted to be familiar with the rules of iGEM, and discussed our own project based on researches and the previous projects. We decided on our final project and initially designed the experimental plans.
2017.2.17-3.27
We screened some strains to obtain the phosphite dehydrogenase gene.
2017.3.28-5.28
We constructed the metabolic pathways of formamide and phosphite into the host to fit our special designed medium.
2017.5.29-6.14
We transformed an EGFP expressing vector into the host to verify effect of the construction.
2017.6.15-7.8
We cultivated the recombinant stains to test their normal growth situation.
2017.7.9-7.27
We verified the function of N&P pathways by using the unsterile cultivating medium and co-culturing the engineering strain with other microorganisms.
2017.7.28-8.12
We examined the enzymatic properties of the enzyme produced by recombinant strains.
2017.8.13-8.21
We selected and designed the target sequence from the genome of T7 phage.
2017.8.22-8.30
We constructed the pTarget-N20, and confirmed its expression along with pCas.
2017.8.31-9.17
We began constructing Biobricks of pSB1C3 backbones.
2017.9.18-9.24
We verified the function of constructed CRISPR/Cas system in recombinant strain.
2017.9.25-10.9
We combined N&P pathways and CRISPR/Cas system together and confirmed the entire functions.
2017.10.10-10.30
We sent our BioBricks for this year. We worked on paperwork of our WIKI.
