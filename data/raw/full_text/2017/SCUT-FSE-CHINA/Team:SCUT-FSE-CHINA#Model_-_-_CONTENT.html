This reminds us that logistic equation may not fit them greatly and we should try to find other models to fit them. We will conduct more experiments to find out the cause of this result in our future work. Though the modeling result is not perfectly fit to the theoretical model, our modeling work still proved that the growth of recombinant strains of both construction ways were encouraging, indicating the recombinant strains were able to utilize formamide and phosphite as their nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively. At the same time, the negative control group was unable to grow normally due to the lack of nitrogen and phosphorus sources.</P><H3>Co-growth Model of Different Strains</H3><P>Besides, growth model can not only apply on pure culture of one kind of bacteria, but also suitable for co-culture of different strains. If different strains culture in the same medium and each of them do not produce the substances which will affect the other bacteria, plundering of nutrients will be the only competition among them. Under this circumstance, their growth curves can still be modeled by a modified logistic function.</P><P>We assume the curvature constant of strain 1 is $r_1$, the curvature constant of strain 2 is $r_2$, and the maximum flora number of both strain is $M$.

While Monod equation is used to relate microbial growth rates in an aqueous environment to the concentration of a limiting nutrient.

When putting a bioprocess into industrial scale, it usually need to face many problems as the environment may change a lot from a shake flask to a tank reactor. Therefore, we plan to put our design in large scale industrial production, rather than limit it in laboratory level. We have considered about some problems when applying the experimental design to production-scale. So we tried to establish such a model, to lay the foundation for the industrial production in the future.</P><P>In aerobic processes, continuous oxygen supplement will be very necessary because the solubility of oxygen in aqueous environment is very low. <I>E. coli</I> is facultative anaerobic that can grow in a hypoxia environment, but for industrial fermentation, we usually need to supply enough oxygen for its growth and production. </P><P>To measure the availability of oxygen, people usually use the oxygen transfer rate (OTR). OTR must be known for an optimum design operation and scale-up of bioreactors, and it should be able to be predicted, if possible. It can be described as</P><CENTER>$$OTR=k_La\cdot(C^*-C_L)$$</CENTER><P>In the equation, $k_La$ is the volumetric mass transfer coefficient. $C^*$ is the dissolved oxygen concentration, which is the concentration of oxygen in liquid phase when the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas phase reaches equilibrium. $C_L$ is the dissolved oxygen concentration on gas-liquid interface in liquid phase. The equation shows that OTR can be described proportional to the concentration gradient. Because of low solubility of oxygen in aqueous solutions, it usually costs a lot when we increase the partial pressure of oxygen by increasing the total pressure of air or using purer oxygen as Henry’s Law said. Therefore, measuring the $k_La$ will be quite necessary. </P><P>According to previous experiments, we know that many factors can effect OTR, such as the shape of reactors, temperature, pressure, power for mixing, liquid density and so on. There have been many empirical equations to determine $k_La$, and some even try to theoretically predict it recently. </P><P>In order to measure the change in oxygen concentration over time, we also need oxygen uptake rate（OUR）. OUR is the oxygen uptake rate of the microorganisms, which stands for the oxygen consumed by microorganisms for growth and production. It can be described as</P><CENTER>
            $$\frac{dC}{dt}=OTR-OUR$$
        </CENTER><P>where $\frac{dC}{dt}$ is the oxygen accumulation rate in liquid phase. After measuring OTR and OUR, we will be able to know the accumulation of oxygen in the liquid phase of our bioreactors, and to regulate the oxygen concentration during the bioprocess, so as to achieve an economical and efficient fermentation process.</P></DIV><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><P style="font-size: small; text-align: center;">
