Meanwhile, CRISPR/Cas system still worked to resist T7 phage and the efficiency of resistance can reached nearly 60%. The efficiency was slightly lower than that culture in LB medium. This may due to lack of enough nutrition in the specific MOPS medium, and we will continue to optimize the concentration of formamide and phosphite of the medium to achieve a satisfactory efficiency.</P><H2>Discussion</H2><P>In this project, we have successfully confirmed that our design of N&amp;P pathways could be a suitable system for production of target products (here we use GFP as an example) in MOPS medium (with formamide as the sole nitrogen source and phosphite as the sole phosphorus source). Moreover, we have verified that the CRISPR/Cas functioned well in our Robust <I>E. coli</I> to resist the T7 phage in the specific medium. Therefore, it is indicated that our Robust system has been built up successfully. We devised to replace the GFP with other genes of interest. In this way, variable fermented products can be produced in specific MOPS medium.</P><P>With our Robust <I>E. coli</I>, open(unsterilized) fermentative process are expected to be operated in a more economic friendly way, as well as be free from the bacterial contamination and phage infection. To make our design become more applicable in practical production, we will try to figure out ways to improve the efficiency of the Robust system in the future.</P><H3>Reference</H3><P>[1] Jr, C. L.
