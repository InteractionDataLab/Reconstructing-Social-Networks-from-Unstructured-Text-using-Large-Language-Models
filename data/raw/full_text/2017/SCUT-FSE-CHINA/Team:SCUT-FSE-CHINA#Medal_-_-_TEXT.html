Register and attend:
We registered for iGEM and prepared this project in this summer. Besides, we are going to attend the Giant Jamboree.
Deliverables:
All deliverables were met. We have submitted many parts, from BBa_K2325000 to BBa_K2325003 and BBa_K2325101 to BBa_K2325104. ( page PARTS)
Attribution:
We created the attribution page on our team Wiki, which provides clear attribution of each aspect of our project as well as those who’ve helped us during this time. ( page Attributions)
Characterization / Contribution:
We participated in the Interlab measurement study in this summer, and our work has been submitted by iGEM HQ.V ( page INTERLAB) .
Silver
Validated Part / Validated Contribution:
BBa_K2325000 to BBa_K2325002 and BBa_K2325101 to BBa_K2325103 works for the N&P pathways, while the BBa_K2325003 and BBa_K2325104 works for the CRISPR/Cas part of our project.
They have functioned as expected to achieve our goal. The results can be seen of the page RESULTS in our wiki. The information of these parts can be found on the Main Page of Part’s Registry. All of these samples have been submitted to the the iGEM Parts Registry.
Collaboration:
Check out all the team and people collaborated with us. ( page Collaborations)
Human practice (silver):
We did quite a lot of education and public human practice. Check it here. ( page HumanPractice - Education & Public Engagement)
Gold
Integrated human practice:
We successfully completed this outreach biosafety program by ourselves and other teams collaborate with us. ( page Integrated HumanPractice)
We also conducted interviews and investigations to improve our design.
Improve a previous part or project:
We have improved the part BBa_K1129012 with a new application of it, the new part has been submitted as BBa_K2325003 . See the Main Page of BBa_K1129012 and BBa_K2325003 for details.
Model:
The models we made helped us design and implement this project, the relevant data and model results are helpful for future new application. ( page MODELING)
Demonstration:
We had constructed four BioBrick devices this year. BBa_K2325101 is the Formamidase expression device. BBa_K2325102 is the Phosphite dehydrogenase expression device. BBa_K2325103 is constructed as the expression device for fusion protein of Formamidase and Phosphite dehydrogenase. BBa_K2325104 is the N20-sgRNA function device.
All of them work well under lab condition. See page RESULTS for details.
