Discussion on biosafety
We learned the biosafety discussion from previous iGEM teams and restrictions of GMO release from several countries and regions, then came up a report about the current situation of GMO release together with our suggestion and solution to it. More details can be found in page Integrated HumanPractice .
General laboratory safety
Considering that we need to be exposed to various microorganisms when in the lab, we decided to follow the Basic laboratories –Biosafety Levels 1 and 2 from Laboratory biosafety manual (Third edition) (WHO).
The documentation contains the rules about access, operation, etc. These rules are crucial for us to gain a base level of knowledge when we work in lab and know how to protect ourselves from some hazardous situations. Moreover, following the rules can help us keep the laboratory not contaminated by microorganisms, so that everyone can share a safe environment to do the experiments.
Access
1. The international biohazard warning symbol and sign (Figure 1) must be displayed on the doors of the rooms where microorganisms of Risk Group 2 or higher risk groups are handled.
2. Only authorized persons should be allowed to enter the laboratory working areas.
3. Laboratory doors should be kept closed.
4. Children should not be authorized or allowed to enter laboratory working areas.
5. Access to animal houses should be specially authorized.
6. No animals should be admitted other than those involved in the work of the laboratory.
Personal protection
1. Laboratory coveralls, gowns or uniforms must be worn at all times for work in the laboratory.
2. Appropriate gloves must be worn for all procedures that may involve direct or accidental contact with blood, body fluids and other potentially infectious materials or infected animals. After use, gloves should be removed aseptically, and hands must then be washed.
3. Personnel must wash their hands after handling infectious materials and animals, and before they leave the laboratory working areas.
4. Safety glasses, face shields (visors) or other protective devices must be worn when it is necessary to protect the eyes and face from splashes, impacting objects and sources of artificial ultraviolet radiation.
5. It is prohibited to wear protective laboratory clothing outside the laboratory, e.g. in canteens, coffee rooms, offices, libraries, staff rooms and toilets.
6. Open-toed footwear must not be worn in laboratories.
7. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics and handling contact lenses is prohibited in the laboratory working areas.
8. Storing human foods or drinks anywhere in the laboratory working areas is prohibited.
9. Protective laboratory clothing that has been used in the laboratory must not be stored in the same lockers or cupboards as street clothing.
Procedures
1. Pipetting by mouth must be strictly forbidden.
2. Materials must not be placed in the mouth. Labels must not be licked.
3. All technical procedures should be performed in a way that minimizes the formation of aerosols and droplets.
4. The use of hypodermic needles and syringes should be limited. They must not be used as substitutes for pipetting devices or for any purpose other than parenteral injection or aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals.
5. All spills, accidents and overt or potential exposures to infectious materials must be reported to the laboratory supervisor. A written record of such accidents and incidents should be maintained.
6. A written procedure for the clean-up of all spills must be developed and followed.
7. Contaminated liquids must be decontaminated (chemically or physically) before discharge to the sanitary sewer. An effluent treatment system may be required, depending on the risk assessment for the agent(s) being handled.
8. Written documents that are expected to be removed from the laboratory need to be protected from contamination while in the laboratory.
Laboratory working areas
1. The laboratory should be kept neat, clean and free of materials that are not pertinent to the work.
2. Work surfaces must be decontaminated after any spill of potentially dangerous material and at the end of the working day.
3. All contaminated materials, specimens and cultures must be decontaminated before disposal or cleaning for reuse.
4. Packing and transportation must follow applicable national and/or international regulations.
5. When windows can be opened, they should be fitted with arthropod-proof screens.
