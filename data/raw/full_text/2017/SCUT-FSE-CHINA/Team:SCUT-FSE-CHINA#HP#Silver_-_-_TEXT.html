2017 Bio-Festival
Time: April 16th    Location: SYSU
We participated in the 2017 Bio-festival held by the student union of School of Life Science, SYSU. That day, we brought our project display board. Many people stopped before our display board, we were glad to introduce our project and the application of our engineering bacteria to them.
We hope that we can help the students to have a better understanding of synthetic biology. This festival also helps us to learn more about the project of other iGEM teams, and we have more ideas on how synthetic biology will affect people's lives.
Giving courses for high school students
Time: August 12th    Location: Guangdong Guangya High School
We gave a course for high school students of Guangdong Guangya High School. Our course mainly focused on the application of modern biotechnology in food production and the basic knowledge of synthetic biology and iGEM.
What’s more, We launched a discussion on how to view synthetic biology, and the students were actively involved in the discussion. Although their knowledge is not sufficient now, they are still very concerned about biosafety issues. Indeed, this is an issues that cannot be ignored.
SIRIO
Time: October 10th-26th    Location: Sirio Pharma Co., Ltd
Sirio Pharma Co., Ltd is a research and development as well as production company of nutrition and health products. We worked as interns in SIRIO for three weeks. During the period, we visited the manufacturing shop to understand how a factory runs. We also worked in the quality control department and learned how to analyze errors in the production. We introduced iGEM and present our project to our fellows on the last day.

Chinese Society of Biotechnology Young Scientists Forum II
Time：April 8th    Location：SCUT
To have a better understanding of the frontier development of biological engineering, we attended Chinese Society of Biotechnology Young Scientists Forum II held in our campus. More than 220 representatives from different fields attended the meeting, including Professor Gao Fu (a pathogens microbiologist and immunologist, the director of the China Society for Biological Engineering, director of the Chinese disease control center), Professor Yue Guojun (Chairman of SDIC Biotechnology Investment Co., Ltd), Professor Floyd E.Romesberg from the United States Scripps Institute (the winner of 2014 Science magazine global top ten breakthroughs in science) and many other scientists.
At the conference, senior scientists set an example and provide a goal for the young scientists, and high-level young scholars demonstrated the research progress of bioengineering in different disciplines.
We have benefited a lot from the forum. The poster communication part gave the participants the opportunity to communicate and discuss. We also learned how to demonstrate and show our research in a better way. Besides, we are exposed to the various biological labeling methods, including the advanced concept, the quantum dots, which provided new ideas for our experiments. At the same time, we also realized the possibility of promotion of biomass and its possible develop directions in China, as well as built up a profound understanding of the importance of biotechnology in environmental protection and conservation of resources.
The fourth Probiotics International Summit Forum
Time：June 30th    Location：SCUT
This forum had attracted lots of scholars in the field of probiotics. Although our project seems a bit far away to the research of probiotics, we still tried to get inspired by the lectures given by experienced scientists. The forum focused more on the research and application of Probiotics and how they help to solve relative nutrition and health problems.
Matsumoto Yuka, a research consultant from the Central Research Institute of Japan Yakult introduced Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota as a commonly used strain in their research of probiotics. This just remained us of a previous iGEM project, the team UBC 2013, who attempted to engineer CRISPR in a way that allows population control in a bioreactor of the fermentative production of yogurt. We then realized that a well constructed bio-system should be universal enough to be applied to different fields and we have tried to integrate this idea into our project design.
