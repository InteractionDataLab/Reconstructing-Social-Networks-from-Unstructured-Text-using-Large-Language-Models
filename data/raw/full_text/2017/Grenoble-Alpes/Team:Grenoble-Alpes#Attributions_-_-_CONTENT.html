We started from scratch and together we were able to realize our project. I am very happy I shared this experience with you.” – Nicolas Iasparro, team leader.</DIV><H2 style="padding-top:0.5%; padding-bottom:4%; color:#FF1493; font-size:3vw;"> Attributions </H2><H5 style="text-align:center; padding-top: 2%;">Back on track from previous participations in 2011, 2012 and 2013, this year, iGEM Grenoble team consisted of 6 life scientists, 4 biomedical engineers, 1 informatics engineer and 2 computer graphics artists. After a couple months brainstorming, we settled on the topic of our project in January, so as to get organized for the work to come.  </H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; "> Project </H5><H5> The scientific and laboratory work was divided into two main axis: the engineering part and the biological part. All Clément Caffaratti, Nicolas Iasparro, Jusuf Imeri, Guillaume Jubien, Martin Lenglet, Emline Leon, Noreen Louis, Romy Rouzeau, Cassandra Vivier-Baudry, Damyana Yancheva contributed to this work but we would like to address a special thanks to Dr. Franz Bruckert, Dr. Pierre Cavailles, Dr. Audrey Le Gouellec, Dr. Bello Mouhamadou and Dr. Nicolas Ruty for providing us with precious advices all along this adventure. 
Both engineering and biological parts were subdivided into specific tasks in order to be as efficient as possible. </H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; "> Application </H5><H5> The smartphone application definitely is at the core of our project and we have Nicolas Iltis to thank for developing it in such a little time notice.</H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; "> 3D Modelisation </H5><H5>In order to have a better visualization of how the kit works, Adrien Olivieri and Loïc Ruel made videos of the 3D model kit.</H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; ">Wiki </H5><H5>Coding the wiki was mostly done by Guillaume Jubien, Martin Lenglet, Noreen Louis, Cassandra Vivier-Baudry even though its structure and design was thought by the two ladies. </H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; "> Safety </H5><H5> Damyana Yancheva looked into the safety situation, insuring the safety of the kit as well as the safety measures that were taken in the lab.</H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; "> Design </H5><H5>The designs of our wiki and other communication materials were created by Guillaume Jubien. </H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; "> Human Practice and collaboration support </H5><H5>From the very beginning, we had at heart to explain our project to the largest audience possible, thus presenting the concept of synthetic biology. 
Nicolas Iasparro and Jusuf Imeri organized the meetings we have had with other teams as well as scientific popularization conference. 
Reflecting on how ethics intervened in our project was realized by Nicolas Iasparro,  Noreen Louis and Cassandra Vivier-Baudry who created a survey to analyse the public’s opinion on specific ethical aspects: GMOs and data privacy. Collaborations was a central aspect of our project, Nicolas Iasparro, Jusuf Imeri and Emline Leon have carried this </H5><H5 style="font-size:1.35vw; padding-top:3%; padding-bottom:0.5%; border-bottom: 1px solid #606060; ">Fundraising </H5><H5> Starting from scratches since iGEM Grenoble team came back up from 2013, we had to find sponsors and financial support to realize our project. The entire team took part in this battle, even though Emline Leon took care of the administration &amp; financial, Romy Rouzeau was handling the treasury. Both were highly helped by Jusuf Imeri, responsible of the funding applications. It is also important to mention that we carried out a self-made crowdfunding campaign thanks to Kocoriko’s platform, mainly realised by Nicolas Iasparro, Emline Leon.</H5><H2 style="padding-top:10%; padding-bottom:4%; color:#FF1493; font-size:3vw;"> Acknowledements </H2><H5> This great adventure would not have been possible without the help of some people that supported our project in many different ways.
