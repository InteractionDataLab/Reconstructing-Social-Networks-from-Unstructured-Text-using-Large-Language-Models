When the fall comes, the landscapes that groove the road to the Galibier completely change colors.

Research almost always involves collaboration,  this is why it is so essential for progress. In the scientific fields especially, collaborations spread all over the world and this can be easily noticed when looking at the number of co-authors of a paper. iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team, guided by this ideal, first collaborated on a small scale, with its own team members, to give birth to innovative ideas, resulting in SnapLab. On a larger scale, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team collaborated with other 2017 teams.
Collaborations are fun!
Collaborations are fun and awesome! Especially when it comes to participating to a discussion with 5 other iGEM teams. In fact, we had a discussion about social responsibility towards the scientific progress with iGEM DTU-Denmark , iGEM Wageningen , iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec , iGEM TECHNION-ISRAEL and iGEM Uppsala which hosted and organised the debate. Prior the debate, iGEM Uppsala sent us multiple questions to further think about the subject so it could be more constructive.  After introducing our projects to the other teams, the idea was to discuss on how to prevent safety related problems. It is crucial to realise that even when working on a project in the iGEM context, social responsibility needs to be considered. It is not because we are in a contest atmosphere that we can forget about putting our project into their contexts and working on the social and ethical issues they might bring.
In the end, we learned a lot from the other teams: each country has its own regulations and might think differently. Hence, this cultural aspect has to be considered as well. We would like to thank iGEM Uppsala for organising this debate it was a lot of fun!
Collaboration with our Frenchie iGEM IONIS-PARIS team
This Parisian team counts several iGEM participations now. This is after the publication of a press article concerning their previous work in 2016 that we started to get in touch. As iGEM Grenoble-Alpes team is back on tracks after many years of absence in Boston, iGEM IONIS helped us through the human practices area. Via internet meetings, the sensitive subject of the genetically modified organisms (GMO) was talked through. Questions on how it’s spreading could be avoided were considered.
Collaboration with iGEM INSA-UPS team
Aware that cholera’s outbreak can cause many issues in countries where health inequalities strike, we noticed that another French team decided to work on cholera! That is why we decided to team up. The idea was to think about how to better manage health crisis by the means of our devices, how our projects can better assess the care quality during health crisis such as the one in Yemen.
iGEM INSA-UPS chose to focus on the detection and removal of Vibrio Cholerae on water, thanks to an ingenious bacterial communication system, on which you can have further informations here .
On the other hand, iGEM Grenoble-Alpes decided to detect Vibrio Cholerae for human diagnosis in particular.
Both projects are obviously complementary, which makes the collaboration even more interesting. In fact, our two projects propose two different but complementary solutions to better manage a Cholera epidemic. These two solutions could be brought to Non Governmental Organisations to help improve both diagnosis and decontamination of Cholera.
In a collaborative state of mind
We also decided to help iGEM Vilnius , iGEM Washington , iGEM Dalhousie , iGEM Waterloo and iGEM IONIS-PARIS teams with their surveys!
