The Aiguilles d’Arves are not only the apex the Maurienne valley, they are also its emblem.

Project description
Vibrio Cholerae is the bacteria responsible for cholera. The tricky thing is that there are only two serogroups of Vibrio Cholerae O1 and O139 that are responsible for epidemics of cholera while the others provoke diarrheas, abscess or septicemia.
This is why we are going to design a pathogen sensitive detector: SnapLab, our portable kit that will detect cholera. After extracting DNA from the feces and performing the analysis, a nucleic acid sequence will be detected if the patient is infected with cholera. Once these sequences are introduced into the bacteria, fluorescence will be emitted and captured by the camera of a smartphone. The application that we will design will not only perform the analysis but it will also do the image processing.
The greatest advantage of this device will be its capability to communicate the results to its user and to map the cases of cholera.
Going forward, this kind of device will be replicable for different pathogens, thus allowing to widen the spectrum of this kit’s use.
Now the project has been briefly explained, you can have further information on the realisation of our project by clicking on any of the three circles or you can directly go to the results .
