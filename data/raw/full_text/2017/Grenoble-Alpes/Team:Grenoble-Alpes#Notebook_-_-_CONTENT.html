We met a lot of different profiles: adults and kids, with or without scientific backgrounds, with or without knowledge in biology… This is why we had to adapt our explanations depending on the type of public we were facing. This allowed us to tremendously improve our scientific communication skills ! As we had the visit of classrooms, from  middle and high school level,  we also organized quizzes about the basics in biology: “What do you know about DNA ?”,  “What is a genetically modified organism ?”. 
The experience was very enriching and receiving the enthusiasm of the public was extremely gratifying. We were even interviewed and got an article about iGEM project in a newspaper!

After many hours of thinking and putting ourselves under pressure, it was indeed pressure that was the answer to our problems. Pressure can force a liquid to pass from one compartment to another but again the question was now! How does pressure need to be applied in the extraction column? Well, the idea would be to use a needle of the same diameter as the column’s and replace every step of centrifuging by the pressure using the needle. In the end, we planned to obtain a good genomic DNA concentration that would permit the diagnosis! You can look at our results for more informations!

Then, Eduard Ayuso, INSERM researcher from University of Nantes (bottom left photo) gave a wonderful lecture about viral vectors and gene therapy. Finally, François Rousse, PhD student in INRIA Grenoble (bottom right photo), was the last speaker with a presentation about biomimetics in mathematics, i.e. the way mathematicians try to mimic natural biological processes. At the end of each talk, the public had the opportunity to ask any kinds of questions or/and start a discussion with the researcher. Around 50 people attended this conference; the public was mainly composed of students -bachelor and master’s degree- but also teachers, speakers’ colleagues, and even students’ relatives. This nice evening of exchange ended with a buffet offered by our team.

Completely impressed by what could be achieved with 3D printing technique, we came down back to earth and focused on how we could concretize our kit. Well, 3D printing is obviously the answer! This limitless technique was the solution to create SnapLab, and even though it sounds simple we still had to optimize the process. But, we cannot deny this feeling of satisfaction when the first pieces of our kit was 3D printed ! Just remember that 3D printing is for sure a technique opening a wide new range of possibilities that we definitely must take advantage of.

From that day, a call for applications started to gather every Biotechnology students that was interested in iGEM. We contacted the 2013 participants so they could give us information, advices, and also… the association, created in 2011 by the very first iGEM Grenoble team. The main aim of this association was to ease the finances. In parallel, we met a few times for brainstormings, to define a project among the tremendous number of ideas we accumulated. It appeared very quickly that we would need students from other fields with other skills, notably in engineering. So, one of us went to present the contest at the beginning of a class of biomedical engineering students, at Phelma. Candidacies arrived within the week and we all met to improve our brainstorming. We particularly learned to know each other the night of our first event: the concert. Soon after, our project was chosen unanimously ! Other recruiting processes were organised in different education sectors but students did not show as enthusiastic as the engineers. During the fundraising period, some students left the adventure. After a few months, we presented the project to designer students, who showed high motivation to help us to present SnapLab. One year later here we are, a smiling team of 12 students: 6 studying Biotechnology/Biology, 5 studying Biomedical Engineering and 2 in 3D modelling/VFX !
