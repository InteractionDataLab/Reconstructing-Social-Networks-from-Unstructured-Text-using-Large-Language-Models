Five teams participated in this forum; Kyoto, Kobe, Nagahama, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo and us.
All team made presentations about projects for iGEM Giant jamboree 2017. After having presentations, we exchanged opinions by Question-and-answer session and questionnaire.
We had a good time to improve our project.</P><P>Thanks to Kyoto team for organizing the lovely forum. Thanks to 4 teams for giving exciting presentations and opinions.</P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kobe/Collaborations" target="_blank">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kobe/Collaborations</A></P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kyoto/Collaborations#Kansai" target="_blank">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kyoto/Collaborations#Kansai</A></P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Nagahama/Collaborations#iGEM_Japan_Kansai_Forum" target="_blank">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Nagahama/Collaborations#iGEM_Japan_Kansai_Forum</A></P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Botchan_Lab_Tokyo/Collaborations" target="_blank">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Botchan_Lab_Tokyo/Collaborations</A></P><H3>May festival</H3><P>We joined an annual meetup which became to be an official event of iGEM at the Tokyo University. Our team introduced our last year’s and this year’s projects. At the meetup, we made a presentation with a poster to the visitor. The age group of visitors were so wide from students of elementary school to senior. So, the event was contributed to recognize the existence of iGEM. We were so surprised at other team’s power of idea though iGEM Japan had the meetup at May 20th. It was so excited to exchange idea and point out each other about the project with other teams.</P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Community/Meetups#MayFestTokyo" target="_blank">https://2017.igem.org/Community/Meetups#MayFestTokyo</A></P><H3>Card game</H3><P>This year we worked with <A href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Franconia " target="_blank "> iGEM Franconia </A>
to make a card game set concerning bio-safety and microorganisms. Our team was in charge of translating the cards into Japanese and giving some advice to improve the game. The goal of this project is to offer information of synthetic biology and microbiology to the public. It is also clear that this game can be used for educational purpose. We are so glad and happy to be a part of this project. Thank you to every team which is participated in this activity.</P><P><A href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Franconia/Collaborations#cardgame

</A></P><H3>iGEM Kobe</H3><P>iGEM Kobe is an iGEM team established by students of Kobe university. Since this is the first year for the team, iGEM Gifu had given some suggestions to improve their project and make it smooth to perform experiments.</P><P>On September 9th one of our team members went to Kobe to communicate directly.  Since both projects are common in Japanese traditional drink. we discussed the issue regarding how synthetic biology should be applied into food section. Furthermore, we talked about the importance of the fact that we have to perform inactivation of transformant after experiments. This year iGEM Kobe treats <I>B.subtilis</I> and we perform transformation of yeast and it was a good chance to understand how to conduct research and maintain bio-safety in cases of microorganisms but <I>E.coli</I>. Especially <I>B.subtilis</I> is said to be one of the strongest bacteria in the world because the species generates spore. This discussion was totally interesting for us. </P><P>Thanks to Kyosuke KITA and Saki MATSUI, members of iGEM Kobe.</P><P><A href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kobe" target="_blank ">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Kobe</A></P><H3>iGEM Nagahama</H3><P>Gifu and Nagahama had a meeting on September 24th. Both teams have similarities in that our projects are related to Japanese fermented products and we decided to transform yeast. Hence, we talked about the regulation of genetically modified food in Japan and how we should perform our projects functionally. At the meeting, we especially advised each other about the experiment of yeast. In addition, we discussed the characteristics of the promoters that each team decided to use and assure whether they are really the best choice for us.</P><P>We taught the research of terminatome to Nagahama that the expression level of mRNA can be regulated not only by the promoters but also by the terminators. Since they decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons, we suggested that they think about terminatome. We believed that this was really  useful information for their project to be improved.</P><P>Nagahama gave us advice on yeast selection marker. We were in trouble of the yeast selection marker, so they told us how to choose the appropriate marker gene and perform selection of transforming.</P><P>Furthermore, we discussed the matter regarding safety and law concerning experiments and GMO. We taught mutually regulations on handling of genetically modified organisms. iGEM Gifu also showed the presentation of bio-safety.</P><P><A href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Nagahama/Collaborations" target="_blank ">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Nagahama/Collaborations</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
