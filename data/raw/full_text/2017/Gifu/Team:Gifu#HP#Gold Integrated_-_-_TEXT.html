INTEGRATED HUMAN PRACTICES
Collecting data about sake
As our project’s target this year is one of the phenomenon of making Japanese sake, we also decided to conduct the research to know the whole process of making Japanese sake. However, none knew scientific knowledge of sake and had drunk the liquor. So we started studying Japanese sake though local sake in Gifu prefecture. During collecting data from Japanese sake brewery, characteristics of sake of each brewery was discovered. Then We began to make a booklet to let readers know iGEM and spreading the chemically deep aspect of sake. In Gifu prefecture, 50 or so brewery made sake, so it is good for iGEM Gifu to study local sake as integrated Human practice. In summer vacation, we visited 10 breweries to interview and sent FAX to 20 breweries to ask each sake’s characteristics, goodness and how to make them. At that time, we found the fact that people work for making sake make an effort to advertise sake to young people to protect this biologically-worthful culture. Therefore, our booklet is basically regarding process of making sake and information of sake breweries in Gifu prefecture.
To produce the booklet, 30 breweries cooperated with us. Among them, we visited the ten sake brewer,Nihonizumi Sake Brewer, Shiraki Tosuke Sake Shop, Miyozakura Sake Brewery, Hazama Sake Brewery, Iwamura Sake Brewery, Otsubo Sake Brewer, Kaba Sake Brewer, Watanabe Sake Brewery, Hirase Sake Brewer, and Komachi Sake Brewer. We studied the sake brewery, process, machine, hygiene control, etc. In addition, adult members tasted sake and felt the relationship between process and its taste. After visiting, I realized that all brewers think hygiene management is the most important, and they are proud of their working.  Through this activity, we also deepened understanding of the mechanism of making sake and the hygiene management. Moreover, we could have connection with the local brewers, and contributed to the development of the local industry. Thanks to all people who cooperated with us.

GIFU SAKE COLLECTION
Helping to organize "sake symposium" held at Gifu University
Professor Nakagawa offered an opportunity to have a presentation at the food and sake symposium held at Gifu University on Octover 21th. Specifically, we showed our research and activities to symposium participants. We distributed booklets made as part of Human practice. Through this activity, we could broadly advertise our research and the existence of iGEM to researcher and students of our university. In addition, we helped this event set up the event venue.
