Presentation in Kagami Reunion
Our team can do iGEM activities thanks to Kagami Reunion’s economic support. Kagami reunion is the people who are older our university’s graduates and much more experienced in the field of agricultural chemistry. We have been supported by them since we started to participate in the iGEM. However, we couldn’t meet them directly at all. At June 3rd , we got a chance to meet them by our professor’s special grace. So, we were able to convey our gratitude for their support by giving a presentation about our activity report of last year. After the presentation, they gave us precious advice and encouragement words. We were so glad to have their words, because they had been active in the field of agricultural chemistry and are professionals.
Introduce iGEM to
1st grade students of  Kagamigahara senior high school
We made a presentation at Kagamigahara High School. The presentation consisted of genetic recombination technology and synthesize biology. The purpose of the visit was to make high school students interested in our activity and help develop synthetic biology. Many students asked about iGEM and biobricks at the lecture. We believe understanding the cutting-edge technology and the real research can be a good chance to think of their future for high school students who would like to be scientists. After the class, we got many letters and questions from students. It was also a good opportunity for us to consider “what education of synthetic biology should be” deeply.

Interaction with Professor at Korea University
We made a presentation at a mini symposium of the open campus. The content was about iGEM and our project of this year.
We also  invited Professor In-geol choi , PI of iGEM KUAS_korea, to our university and held an international workshop for high school students who are eager to learn synthetic biology in the future. Following the event, one of our members, advisors and our PI, Professor Iwahashi, discussed what important thing is for all iGEM teams to conduct good research. According to In-geol choi, “independence” is one of the keys to have good experiences in iGEM. We learned the fact that iGEMers should not rely on PI or advisors too much simply because making mistakes and thinking of solutions are what we can go through and makes us stronger. Thank you to Professor In-geol choi and iGEM KUAS_korea .
Gifu university’s festival
We got the chance at the university festival held from October 26 to October 29 to show iGEM-Gifu’s activity with panels. We introduced the booklet about brewery companies in the prefecture, too. We expected audience to be informed of the activities of iGEM-Gifu and be interested in biology through panel exhibitions to visitors. We also hope them to be interested in Sake and methods of making sake which is Japan's advanced traditional technology that lasts over 1300 years.
