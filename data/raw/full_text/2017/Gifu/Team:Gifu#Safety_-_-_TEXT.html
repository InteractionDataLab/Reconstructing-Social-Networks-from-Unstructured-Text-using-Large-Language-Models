Safety
１．What is your chassis organism?
E. coli K-12 JM109 Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303
２．Do you plan to experiment with any other organisms, besides your chassis?
We will use Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.
３．How will your project work?
We conduct to recombine genes to yeast and aim to make biosensor that find Hiochi bacteria
４．What risks does your project pose at the laboratory stage? What actions are you taking to reduce those risks?
We often use drastic medicine （NaOH,C6H5OH,CHCl3）. So,We follow our laboratory rule and we discuss about risk.
５．How would your project be used in the real world?
Only in the lab. We aim to make biosensor that find Hiochi bacteria.
６．What risks might your project pose, if it were fully developed into a real product that real people could use?
We will not bring our biosensor forward outside a laboratory.
７．What future work might you do to reduce those risks?
We have to obey the law（Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms）.
８．Any further comments about your project: Comments about this form: Is it easy or difficult to use? Are the questions confusing?
It was easy to use.
Our safety activity
iGEM Gifu aim to the top-class of guarantee safety in the experiment. We often have a meeting with our   teacher. We check and improve our safety in laboratory by the meeting.  Graduate students（one-time our team member）take part in the meeting as adviser.  So, we can receive advice by them. We discuss various things from a basic thing to a special thing in a meeting. For example, Wear a white robe, protector and gloves as needed, how to handle recombination, learn about Cartagena law（"Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms"）and so on.  Last year, we participate training session that our university conduct for student, we can learn basic safety in experiment. We can check important points to conduct safety experiment by the session. This year our safety activity is more developing. In addition to last year activity, we hold an exchange meeting with other iGEM team and discuss safety activity for improve our safety. The exchange meeting with iGEM Nagahama, we introduced the safety manual of each other's universities and discussed. We also discussed our laboratory risk. As a result of argument, we rechecked below.
・Check emergency exits, and Learn how to use fire extinguishers
・ Tidy the laboratory table and keep it always cleanly
・ Check the characteristic of the microbe and hande according to the characteristic Pay full attention about the unidentified bacteria from nature in particular
・Don’t add bacteria to a hand and clothes, and don’t pollute environment from an appliance or the waste which you used
・When you discard culture, you must sterilize it
・When you handle a microbe, must not put tubes with the culture fluid in the pocket of clothes
・When you get injured with glassware or needle considered that bacteria attach, please contact a teacher
We believe firmly that we were able to have a meaningful exchange of opinions. We think we have to keep our safety activity and develop it.
