Introduction
We joined InterLab Measurement Study in this year. Eight devices were transformed into DH5a E.coli cells. We measured fluorescence of transformed cells.
Materials and Methods
Materials
・Safire ART-NR:F129013
It is a plate reader to measure absorbance and fluorescence of samples.
Methods
1. Calculate the OD600 Reference point
Measure absorbance 600 nm of LUDOX-S40 and H2O in a 96 well plate in our plate reader. It is to obtain a ratiometric conversion factor to transform our absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement.
2. Generate the FITC fluorescence standard curve
Prepare a dilution series of FITC in 4 replicates and measure the fluorescence in a 96 well plate in our plate reader. By measuring these in all standard modes, we can generate a standard curve of fluorescence for FITC concentration.
3. Measure cell
Day1 : Transform Escherichia coli these plasmids.
Plasmids
・Positive control
・Negative control
・Device1 : J23101.BCD2.E0040.B0015
・Device2：J23106.BCD2.E0040.B0015
・Device3：J23117.BCD2.E0040.B0015
・Device4：J23101+I13504
・Device5：J23106+I13504
・Device6：J23117+I13504
Day2 : Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and glow the cells in 5 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol overnight. (37○C and 220ppm)
Day3 : Cell growth, sampling, and assay
Measure OD600 of these cells cultures and dilute it to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 12 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol and incubate the cultures (37○C and 220rpm).At 0,2,4 and 6 hours of incubation take 500 μL samples of the cultures. At the end of sampling point, measure Absorbance 600 nm and Fluorescence of these samples. (Use same instrument setting when measuring the FITC standard curve.)
Result
1. Calculate the OD600 Reference point
The Abs600 data of LUDOX and H2O is Table1.  And correction factor to transform our absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement is calculated by the following formula.

2. Generate the FITC fluorescence standard curve
The fluorescence data of FITC is table2. And FITC standard curve is figure1.
