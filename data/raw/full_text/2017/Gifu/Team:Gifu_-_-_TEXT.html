Project Description
Our team will try to make a new technology called LAM (Lactic acid mediated) communication utilizing GAR+ prion. GAR, or glucose associated repression controls the usage of glucose of yeast. In 2016, it was proved that this pathway is managed by the certain amount of lactic acid. Lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria, affects the prion formed gar- and induces the formation of GAR+. Considering this mechanism and terminators of fission yeast and regulating the amount of mRNA of GFP and anti-GFP, we will enable yeast to communicate each other beyond the species of gram-negative bacteria and make a biosensor to sense hiochi.
Bronze Medal Criteria
Register and attend
Register for iGEM, have a great summer, and attend the Giant Jamboree.
Deliverables
Meet all deliverables on the Competition Deliverables page(section 4).
Attribution
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly designate work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.   Attributions
Characterization / Contribution
Participate in the Interlab Measurement Study and/or improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2017 part number range.  Part Collection
Silver Medal Criteria
Validated Part / Validated Contribution
Convince the judges that at least one new BioBrick Part of your own design that is central to your project works as expected. Document the experimental characterization of this part on the Main Page of that Part’s Registry entry. Submit a sample of this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (following Registry submission guidelines). This working part must be different from the part documented in gold #2.
Collaboration
Convince the judges you have significantly worked with any other registered iGEM team in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team, characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, model/simulate a system or validate a software/hardware solution to a synbio problem, or be the recipient of any of these activities.   Collaborations
Human Practices
Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is safe, responsible and good for the world. You could accomplish this through engaging with your local, national and/or international communities or other approaches. Please note that standard surveys will not fulfill this criteria.   Human Practices
Gold Medal Criteria
Integrated Human Practices
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.   Integrated Human Practices
Improve a previous part or project
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part. The original part must NOT be from your 2017 part number range. If you change the original part sequence, you must submit a new part. In addition, both the new and original part pages must reference each other.
Model your project
Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. Thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, and model results.
Demonstrate yout work
Convince the judges that your project works.
