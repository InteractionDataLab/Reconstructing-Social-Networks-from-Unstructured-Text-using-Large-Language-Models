STANDARD PAGES
WIKI PHILOSOPHY
In making our Wiki, we strive to make navigation as simple and intuitive as possible. To achieve this goal, all material is placed on eight pages: Project Background, Experimental Summary, Modeling, Prototype, Human Practice Summary, Biosafety, About Us, and Attributions. Everything we did is documented on these pages. Other important pages, such as those used for judging, collaborations, team, notebook, parts, etc, can also be accessed via this sitemap. This year, iGEM rules require teams to place all information that are presented to the judges to be placed on static Standard Pages. Although we create these pages, the only intended audience are judges. Normal visitors should not visit these pages; the major eight pages in the navigation contains all information.
