PR CALCULATOR
BIOFILM CALCULATOR
hi
SOFTWARE
We’ve created four calculators based on our modeling data to inform WWTP managers on the amount of Proteorhodopsin (PR) bacteria or biofilm-coated biocarriers they need to remove nanoparticles (NPs). Imagine yourself as a WWTP manager and try our PR and biofilm calculators below!

PR BACTERIA CALCULATORS
PR_Runner is a calculator that outputs the final NP concentration given the following inputs: initial NP concentration, initial PR bacteria concentration and intended time. Try the PR_Runner calculator below!
Initial NP Concentration (micromolar)
Target NP Concentration (micromolar)
Retention Time (the amount of time water stays in the tank, hours)
Calculate!
Initial Bacteria Concentration Needed (# of bacteria/microliter):    
ReversePR_Runner is a calculator that outputs the final bacteria concentration given the following inputs: initial and target NP concentration and intended retention time. Try the ReversePR_Runner calculator below!
Initial NP Concentration (micromolar)
Initial Bacteria Concentration (# of cells/microliter)
Amount of time that can be used for the process (hours)
Calculate!
Resulting NP Concentration (micromolar):    
BIOFILM CALCULATORS
Biofilm_Runner is a calculator that outputs the NP concentration of the effluent given the following inputs: initial NP concentration, speed of water in contact with biofilm, total volume of container, time for biofilm to be in contact with NP solution, and the number of biocarriers used. Try the Biofilm_Runner calculator below!
Initial nanoparticle concentration (micromolar)
Speed of water in contact with biofilm (cm/min)
Total Volume of Container (L)
Time for biofilm to be in contact with NP solution (minutes)
# of biocarriers used (SA of 44.8 cm2 each)
Calculate!
Resulting Nanoparticle Concentration (micromolar):    
ReverseBiofilm_Runner is a calculator that outputs the number of biocarriers needed given the following inputs: initial and target NP concentration, speed of water in contact with biofilm, total volume of container, and time for biofilm to be in contact with NP solution. Try the ReverseBiofilm_Runner calculator below!
Initial NP concentration (micromolar)
Target NP Concentration (micromolar)
Speed of Water in contact with Biofilm (cm/min)
Total Volume of tank (L)
Total time biofilm is in contact with NP solution (minutes)
Calculate!
# of biocarriers needed (SA of 44.8 cm2 each):    
All units of the output and the inputs are included in the program. Enter as many significant digits as possible for more accurate results. To inspect the code of each .jar files, unzip with tools like 7zip or Winzip and then use BlueJ (free Java IDE) to open the package.
