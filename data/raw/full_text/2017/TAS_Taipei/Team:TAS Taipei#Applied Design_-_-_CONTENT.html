The water can then be processed in three main stages: Primary, Secondary, and sometimes Tertiary Treatment (Pescod 1992). In <B>Primary Treatment</B>, heavy solids are removed by sedimentation while floating materials (such as oils) can be taken out by skimming. However, dissolved materials and colloids—small, evenly dispersed solids such as NPs—are not removed here (Pescod 1992). <B>Secondary Treatment</B> generally involves the use of aeration tanks, where aerobic microbes help to break down organic materials. This is also known as the activated sludge process (Davis 2005). In a subsequent sedimentation step, the microbes are removed and the effluent is disinfected (often by chlorine or UV) before it is released into the environment. In certain WWTPs, wastewater may go through <B>Tertiary Treatment</B>, an advanced process typically aimed to remove nitrogen and phosphorous, and assumed to produce an effluent free of viruses (Pescod 1992). However, Tertiary Treatment requires additional infrastructure that is expensive and complex, limiting its global usage (Pescod 1992; Malik 2014). </H4></DIV><DIV class="row"><H4 class="para col-lg-12">Ideally, we would like to remove NPs from all systems, so we visited two different types of WWTPs: a local urban facility in Dihua, Taipei, and a smaller rural facility in Boswell, Pennsylvania. We found that wastewater in the two plants is treated using very similar processes (figures 5-2 and 5-3). We also contacted Thomas J. Brown, the Water Program Specialist of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and asked him if there were differences between rural and urban plants that we should consider when thinking about implementing our project. He responded, <B>“[t]he heart of the treatment process is the biological process used for treatment; the biology remains the same regardless of facility size.”</B> Thus, in both types of WWTPs, we want to apply our engineered bacteria in the Secondary Treatment step—either in aeration tanks or in the sedimentation tank.

Most importantly, <B>biosafety is built into WWTPs</B>.

To learn more about those specific conditions, we visited and talked to engineers at Dihua WWTP, our local urban facility. At Dihua, wastewater is retained in aeration tanks for <B>up to 5 hours</B>, and a <B>central rotor constantly churns the wastewater</B>. To simulate these conditions, we built our own “aeration tank” using clear cylinders and a central rotor.

                     In WWTPs, aeration tanks lead to secondary sedimentation tanks (figure 5-2), where flocculants—polymers that aggregate suspended solids—are added to accelerate sedimentation. During our visit to Dihua WWTP, the engineers gave us samples of their flocculants. After 5 hours of mixing, we stopped the rotor and added the flocculant powder used by Dihua WWTP to each tank (video 5-1).

These tests were performed with Gold NPs (AuNPs). Because AuNP solution is purple in color, we can take absorbance measurements and convert these values to AuNP concentration using a standard curve (figure 5-5A). 10 mL of AuNP solution was added to different volumes of biofilm (figure 5-5B). The containers were shaken at 100 rpm overnight to maximize interaction between the biofilm and AuNPs. Finally, the mixtures were transferred to conical tubes and centrifuged to isolate the supernatant, which contains free AuNPs quantifiable using a spectrophotometer set at 527 nm. 
                        Adding more than 1 mL of biofilm to the same amount of AuNP solution did not trap more AuNPs (figure 5-5C). We observed that 1 mL of biofilm was just enough to fully cover the bottom of the container.

The bottom 0.5 cm of each container was covered by biofilm, then 10 mL of AuNP solution was added. In this case, the depth of biofilm is consistent, so the contact area between AuNPs and biofilm is equal to the area of the container’s base. All containers were shaken at 100 rpm at room temperature. Every hour (for a total of five hours), one replicate from each group was centrifuged and the absorbance of free AuNPs in the supernatant was measured at 527 nm.

The director of Boswell’s WWTP told us that most sedimentation tanks use devices called surface skimmers, which constantly rotate around a central axle, to remove oils; we envision attaching our prototype to the same central axle. In WWTPs that do not have a central rotor in the sedimentation tank, a motor and rod could be easily installed. The slow rotation would keep biofilm structure intact while at the same time, increase the amount of NPs that come into contact with our biofilm.
