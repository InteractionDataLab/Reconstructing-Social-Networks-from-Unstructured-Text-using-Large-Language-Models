The increasing industrial and commercial use of NPs are a potential health issue, because the small size of NPs can negatively impact biological systems. We interviewed several NP experts, such as Dr. Gwo-Dong Roam and Dr. Eric Lee to gather  viewpoints on the impact of NPs in wastewater systems. Both of them agreed that <B>NP waste is an issue that requires more attention</B> and is difficult to control. We visited two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to study their current treatment and biosafety protocols as well as the design of the treatment plant. Aside from lab work, <B>our team felt a responsibility to raise awareness on the potential health risks associated with the use of NPs</B>. We held an interactive role-playing bioethics panel where participants learned about different perspectives of producers and consumers of NPs. During a tour around Taipei and at our school’s annual spring fair, we handed out fliers and asked people to take surveys in order to gain an understanding of public knowledge on NP usage. Lastly, we created and distributed a policy brief regarding how NPs are currently regulated. We also gave suggestions on how to improve NP definition in current policy. The Minister of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) replied and said that <B>he would take our policy brief into consideration for future decisions</B>. Also, <I>The China Post</I> and <I>The News Lens International Edition</I> published an article about our brief to over 200,000 daily readers.

                           We interviewed Professor Roam of National Central University and former general director of the Environmental Analysis Labs (EAL) of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to learn more about the background and potential threat of NPs. Dr. Roam informed us that the most common NPs used in Taiwan include: TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, ZnO, Ag, Au, Fe, Carbon Nanotubes, Fullerenes, Clay, and Graphene. He also told us that the toxicity of a NP is directly related to its size, but there are currently no regulations or guidelines that specify the toxicity of different types and sizes of NPs. With the increased use of NPs in society, Dr. Roam believes that more attention should be placed on waste management, risk assessment and regulations.

                            After our first visit to the Dihua WWTP, we learned that the sludge removed from wastewater is either 1) sent to landfills, 2) used as fertilizer, or 3) incinerated. We asked Dr. Roam if aggregated NPs in the waste sludge would still be harmful to the environment if disposed using current methods. He said that all of these sludge disposal solutions are still harmful to the environment, but they are better than letting NPs flow into bodies of water. He advised us to target removal of NPs in the wastewater treatment process before it is discharged. (Interviewed by Candice L. and Justin Y.)

                              In order to learn firsthand about the effect of NPs in WWTPs, we visited the Dihua WWTP (迪化污水處理廠). Here, we were given a tour around the plant, and were able to ask questions to the managers and people who work there. They confirmed that the current facilities are unable to remove NPs from wastewater mainly due to their small size. In addition to this information, they kindly provided us with samples of sludge, effluent water, and the polymers they add during the wastewater treatment process. Throughout the year, we visited and talked to the Dihua WWTP several times about where and how our project could be implemented in their current system. These conversations and visits played a huge role in shaping our construct design, prototype design, mathematical modeling and overall purpose for our project.  (Whole team activity)

                            Not all WWTPs are as large as the one in Taipei. One of our advisors (Jude Clapper) went to visit the Boswell WWTP in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. We learned that the same processes that occur in the Taipei Dihua WWTP also occur in the Boswell WWTP, but with different water flow rates and waste quantities. Since both facilities use a similar water purification process, we were inspired to create our current prototype design--a rotating polymeric bioreactor coated in biofilm--which is applicable to both WWTPs. This prototype will be placed in the secondary sedimentation tank, where the majority of organic solids have been removed and only smaller particles exist. The plant manager, Robert J. Blough, also confirmed that since our project is bacteria-based, it will be killed by UV light and chlorine in the disinfection tank, similar to the Dihua WWTP, before the water turns into effluent and goes to the rivers and oceans.

                            We contacted the company that removes our NP waste because we wanted to know what happens when it leaves our lab. They directed us to National Cheng Kung university who actually treats the waste for them. The university uses chemicals and burning to aggregate NPs. Through literature research, we discovered that burning NPs is the most prevalent way for removal, however it is not 100% effective at removing all types of nanomaterials (<I>Marr et. al.</I> 2013).

                            At our school’s annual spring fair, we operated a booth where people could create their own glitter slime by mixing polyvinyl alcohol and sodium borate solutions. The slime was meant to simulate the trapping of NPs (in this demo, glitter) by biofilm. We also showed a few SEM images of bacteria, as well as everyday products that contain NPs such as toothpaste and sunscreen. Everyone who came to our booth was encouraged to take our survey so we could record opinions on bioethics and concerns about NPs. (Whole team activity)

                             Our team has conducted extensive research on existing regulatory laws and policies regarding NPs and nanomaterials. We have investigated chemical regulations, including the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TCSA), the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, and the Clean Air Act (CAA). There are significant obstacles to successfully regulating NPs, such as conflicting definitions on NPs that lead to an inability to successfully regulate manufacturers. Research has also been conducted on the hazardous effects of NPs on the human body and environment. We decided to compose a policy brief highlighting the existing challenges in NP regulation and the lessons learned from previous failure to regulate new chemical substances. The brief was sent out to regulatory agencies, government agencies, and news outlets to raise awareness about the issue. We feel responsible to let others know about the damage NP waste can do to the environment. (Policy Brief created by Ashley L.)
