Here, we were given a tour around the plant, and were able to ask questions to the managers and people who work there. They confirmed that the current facilities are unable to remove NPs from wastewater mainly due to their small size. In addition to this information, they kindly provided us with samples of sludge, effluent water, and the polymers they add during the wastewater treatment process. Throughout the year, we visited and talked to the Dihua WWTP several times about where and how our project could be implemented in their current system.

                            Not all WWTPs are as large as the one in Taipei. One of our advisors (Jude Clapper) went to visit the Boswell WWTP in rural southwestern Pennsylvania. We learned that the same processes that occur in the Taipei Dihua WWTP also occur in the Boswell WWTP, but with different water flow rates and waste quantities. Since both facilities use a similar water purification process, we were inspired to create our current prototype design--a rotating polymeric bioreactor coated in biofilm--which is applicable to both WWTPs. This prototype will be placed in the secondary sedimentation tank, where the majority of organic solids have been removed and only smaller particles exist. The plant manager, Robert J. Blough, also confirmed that since our project is bacteria-based, it will be killed by UV light and chlorine in the disinfection tank, similar to the Dihua WWTP, before the water turns into effluent and goes to the rivers and oceans.

                            We visited the Taipei Museum of Drinking Water hoping to find out more about how tap water is treated. We learned that water filtration methods vary in different areas of Taiwan, with Taipei’s filtration method being the simplest since the water is relatively clean compared to other regions, such as Kaohsiung, where the city is heavily industrialized. In Taipei, the source of tap water comes from a protected zone upstream of Xindian river. We also learned that they use sedimentation tanks and flocculation to help clump up and remove impurities. Due to the lack of a disinfection step, however, we realized that our project would not be applicable here, since our project depends on the use of <I>E. coli</I> bacteria. (Whole team activity)

We asked him about our two approaches, one with <I>E. coli</I> receptors that bind to the capping agents of NPs, the other with biofilm that traps NPs. Dr. Lee suggested that our membrane receptor must be specific to a particular capping agent. He also commented that the biofilm approach was a good idea since we could trap multiple types of NPs regardless of their capping agent. (Interviewed by Emily C.)

Dr. Roam informed us that the most common NPs used in Taiwan include: TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, ZnO, Ag, Au, Fe, Carbon Nanotubes, Fullerenes, Clay, and Graphene. He also told us that the toxicity of a NP is directly related to its size, but there are currently no regulations or guidelines that specify the toxicity of different types and sizes of NPs. With the increased use of NPs in society, Dr. Roam believes that more attention should be placed on waste management, risk assessment and regulations.

                            After our first visit to the Dihua WWTP, we learned that the sludge removed from wastewater is either 1) sent to landfills, 2) used as fertilizer, or 3) incinerated. We asked Dr. Roam if aggregated NPs in the waste sludge would still be harmful to the environment if disposed using current methods. He said that all of these sludge disposal solutions are still harmful to the environment, but they are better than letting NPs flow into bodies of water. He advised us to target removal of NPs in the wastewater treatment process before it is discharged. (Interviewed by Candice L. and Justin Y.)

                            To learn more about the applications of NPs, we visited a nanotech company that uses silver NPs to make various antimicrobial products. The researcher and manager of Apex Nanotek, Chery Yang, introduced us to their main product, which is antimicrobial nanosilver activated carbon. Pure activated carbon, commonly used to treat sewage and industrial exhaust, is prone to bacterial growth. To overcome this problem, they integrate crystallized nanosilver into the activated carbon for their antimicrobial effects. One of their products is a showerhead, with nanosilver activated carbon filters to kill bacteria when water flows through the showerhead.
                             We tested the product by comparing SEM images between tap water and filtered water from the showerhead. The showerhead decreased the number of bacteria and larger particles from tap water! However, we also observed the release of NPs from the filter, which will flow into wastewater.

We then asked for their opinions on NP usage and disposal from the perspective of their assigned role. (Whole team activity)
                             For instance, one of our questions was:
                             “Dihua WWTP has no nanoparticle removal plan. Should this be the job of the wastewater plant? Or the nanoparticle manufacturer?”
                             The following roles were assigned:

                            Our team has conducted extensive research on existing regulatory laws and policies regarding NPs and nanomaterials. We have investigated chemical regulations, including the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TCSA), the Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, and the Clean Air Act (CAA). There are significant obstacles to successfully regulating NPs, such as conflicting definitions on NPs that lead to an inability to successfully regulate manufacturers. Research has also been conducted on the hazardous effects of NPs on the human body and environment. We decided to compose a policy brief highlighting the existing challenges in NP regulation and the lessons learned from previous failure to regulate new chemical substances. The brief was sent out to regulatory agencies, government agencies, and news outlets to raise awareness about the issue.

The slime was meant to simulate the trapping of NPs (in this demo, glitter) by biofilm. We also showed a few SEM images of bacteria, as well as everyday products that contain NPs such as toothpaste and sunscreen.

Before we decided our project topic, we developed 4 different project ideas to present at our first research symposium (poster session). We received feedback from both students and teachers, then decided on our current project. At our second research symposium, we presented on our current project, Nanotrap!

                            We have continued and strengthened our long-standing partnership with National Yang Ming University (NYMU_Taipei). They troubleshooted our cloning procedure and design of primers, gave us protocols for assaying biofilm production, and trained our future iGEMers (Leona and Catherine). 

In return, we helped add to the characterization of their lactose-induced suicide mechanism: the Holin-Endolysin-NrtA system (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2350021">BBa_K2350021</A>). We measured the population of their kill-switch bacteria in different lactose concentrations, and found that our results are consistent with their findings.

                            We first met the CGU_Taiwan team at the end of our presentation for the Asia Pacific iGEM Conference hosted at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU). 

They were excited that our biofilms were able to trap nanoparticles and wondered if biofilm could trap ink as well. CGU_Taiwan is working on improving the procedure to manufacture reprocessed paper. They found that a process called “flotation,” typically used to de-ink paper, could cause significant paper fiber loss. They wondered if biofilm could potentially replace the current flotation process to preserve paper fibers. We offered to test this for CGU_Taiwan. We used a similar experimental procedure as our preliminary biofilm trapping experiment. The results suggest that <B>our biofilms can trap ink particles</B>. As shown below, the relative absorbance of ink decreased by approximately 50% when mixed with biofilm.
