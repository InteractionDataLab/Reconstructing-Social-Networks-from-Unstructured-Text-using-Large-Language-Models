When both proteins are overexpressed, we hypothesized that twice the amount of curli monomers should be made and exported to form fibers and biofilm. When we compared protein expression using SDS-PAGE, we found that <B>BBa_K2229300 stimulated the expression of more curli proteins compared to samples that only expressed CsgD or OmpR234 alone.</B> Using Congo Red, a dye commonly used to measure biofilm production, we also found that overexpression of both OmpR234 and CsgD <B>(BBa_K2229300) increased biofilm production and adhesion to glass coverslips</B> the most. These results show that the combination of BBa_K342003 and BBa_K805015 in a new composite part improves the individual functions, and BBa_K2229300 increases the yield of biofilm production.

                            The original parts, <B>BBa_K342003 (<I>ompR234</I> ORF) and BBa_K805015 (<I>csgD</I> ORF),</B> were cloned into expression devices, Bba_K2229200 and Bba_K2229100, respectively. We observed the expected bands at 25 kDa for CsgD and 27 kDa for OmpR234. Cultures carrying BBa_K2229300 (CsgD and OmpR234 expression), however, showed two extra bands at 15 kDa and 30 kDa, which were not observed in cultures expressing either CsgD or OmpR234 alone. We looked into the other curli operon genes, and found that CsgG is around 30 kDa, whereas CsgA, B, C, E, and F are all around 15 kDa (<I>Robinson et al.</I> 2006; <I>Uhlich et al.</I> 2009; <I>Shu et al.</I> 2012).

                            After confirming protein expression, we wanted to test if our constructs actually lead to faster and greater biofilm production. We used <B>Congo Red (CR)</B>, a dye commonly used to measure biofilm production (Reinke &amp; Gestwicki 2011). CR solution mixed with bacterial liquid cultures were transferred to 12-well plates with glass coverslips and incubated at 37ËšC for one day. The samples were then washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and dried. Any stained biofilm on the glass coverslips was solubilized in ethanol, and absorbance was measured at 500 nm (figures 3-19). If biofilms were present, the solution would appear red, which could be quantified by an absorbance value.

When all three expression constructs were compared, we find that <B>overexpression of OmpR234 and CsgD together (BBa_K2229300) increased biofilm production the most (figure 3-19).</B> BBa_K2229300 also increased adhesion to glass coverslips, and we could see a layer of biofilm which remained attached to the glass surface after the washing steps (figure 3-19, A).
