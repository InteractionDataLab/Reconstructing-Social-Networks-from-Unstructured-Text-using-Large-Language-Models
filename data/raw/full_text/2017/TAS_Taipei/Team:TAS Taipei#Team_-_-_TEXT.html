ABOUT TAIPEI AMERICAN SCHOOL
hi
TEAM
We are the Taipei American School iGEM team, Taiwan's first high school team. Our team consists of 27 dedicated members, 11 of whom will be attending the jamboree in Boston. This is our fourth year participating in the iGEM competition, and we look forward to continuing for years to come!

ABOUT TAIPEI AMERICAN SCHOOL
Taipei American School is a private independent school with an American-based curriculum located in Tianmu (T'ien-mu), Shilin District (Shih-lin), Taipei City. TAS strives to stay ahead of the curve in STEAM education. An important aspect of STEAM education is the 'E': Engineering. Our iGEM team represents the application of engineering beyond robotics.
About the lab
We work in the Sandy R. Puckett Memorial Research Lab, which was completely renovated in 2013 to provide a research laboratory for on-campus student research in chemistry, synthetic biology and nanotechnology. It is fully equipped with lab tools for research for the iGEM competition. The students have the opportunity to be creative and exploratory in many areas of scientific research at TAS.
Synthetic Biology
The fusion between biological research and engineering has culminated in the creation of synthetic biology. This interdisciplinary area was facilitated by the recent advances in technology, allowing biological devices to be designed and contructed as if they were machinery. However, the advent of synthetic biology has raised concerns with biosafety and biosecurity, which is why iGEM places such importance on "safety".
