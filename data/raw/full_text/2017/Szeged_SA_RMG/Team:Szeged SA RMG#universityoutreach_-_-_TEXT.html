Lecture to University Students
Two members of our team represented our scientific research work in our hometown, at the Department of Biology at the University of Szeged on the 19th of October. For our greatest pleasure, university students were extremely eager to know about our scientific project. After our presentation, they asked a lot of interesting questions that made our members more enthusiastic. Approximately 250 students were present in our lecture. This opportunity made it possible for our team to develop communication skills and to raise young people's interests and widen their knowledge about synthetic biology.
