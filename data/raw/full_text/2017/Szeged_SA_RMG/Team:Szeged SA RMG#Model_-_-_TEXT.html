The goal of the measurement
Our final product is a genetically modified Methylococcus capsulatus strain, which - hopefully - produce lactate from methane. In order to estimate the possible effectiveness of this bacteria, we decided to use a lactate   assay kit. The main idea of our final measurement is a 3D graph which will give us a clue how our product is able to measure the methane concentration effectively.
The calculation of a certain data
The measurement will be carried out with Sigma-Aldrich Colorimetric Lactate Assay Kit (MAK064). During the measurement a calibration curve should be determined and used to obtain the lactate concentration of the medium.   Concentration of lactate in a certain medium solution, based on the protocol provided by the distributor company, can be calculated as C=Sa/Sv, where Sa = Amount of lactate acid in unknown sample (nmol) from standard curve;   Sv = Sample volume (mL) added into the wells; C = Concentration of lactate acid in sample.
The measurement scheme is as follows:
Unfortunately we couldn't manage to obtain the final bacteria, thus the measurement remained a plan for the next week - hopefully we can present the results at the Jamboree.
