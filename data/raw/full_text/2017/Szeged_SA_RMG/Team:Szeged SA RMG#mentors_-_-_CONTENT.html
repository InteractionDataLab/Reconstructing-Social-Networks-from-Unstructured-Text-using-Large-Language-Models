	    I started my career in 1993 at the Dugonics András Piarist Grammar School, Szeged, where I taught chemistry and biology, both as part of the regular
		curriculum and in advanced elective courses as well as special after-school lessons. In 1998–99, I played a leading role in designing and equipping
		the science section of the school’s new building. I was also the head of the department of biology and chemistry for four years. Since 2002, I have
		taught in the special biology, chemistry and mathematics programs at the Radnóti Miklós Grammar School in Szeged, mostly in small groups. Between
		2005 and 2012, I headed the biology department, which developed into the most successful high school biology workshop in the country during that
		period, based on advanced Matura examination and competition results. My colleagues and I have also established a state-of-the-art high school molecular
		biology laboratory. This facility has been made available to biology teachers from other schools for in-service trainings as well as to students for selection
		tests for international biology competitions. My colleagues and I have attended in-service trainings in molecular biology at the EMBL laboratories in
		Cambridge, Heidelberg and Monterotondo on a number of occasions. Since 2009, I have been the team leader of the Hungarian national teams at the
		International Biology Olympiad (IBO) and mentor to our national teams at the European Union Science Olympiad (EUSO). In 2010, I won the Rátz Lifetime
		Achievement Award. I am currently head of the EU-funded high school science laboratory.

		I’ve been an associate at the TERMOSZ Laboratory since 2014, I consider it as a prime element in my life. During my high school years I had the
		opportunity of assisting at the Cell Biology and Evolutional Micropaleontology Laboratory of the University of Szeged, which helped me start my scientific
		work. Throughout my university studies I was co-authoring several English publications, participated in an Indian-Hungarian joint research and for years
		I was the technical editor of the Plant Cell Biology and Development (Szeged) issue. In addition I also acquired some successful applications (pro Renovada
		Cultura Hungariae Fund – ’Students for Science’ foundation). My interests shifted towards molecular biology - starting from 2001, I carried
		out my PhD studies at the Genetic Institute of the Biological Research Center Hungarian Academy of Sciences); later on I worked there as a science assistant.
		Next to learning the basic molecular biology techniques and elaborating new methods I also participated in several conferences. At the moment I’m teaching
		Biology at the Randóti Miklós Grammar School and tending to the TERMOSZ Laboratory.
