	I am a 18-year-old high school student in a biology-oriented class. I am responible for among others the biosafety  part in our enthusiastic team. I really enjoy working in a microbiological laboratory, however, my real passion is observing animal anatomy and behaviour. I have always been inpressed by the colourful scale of animal species and I want to reach a deeper insight into their unique world. It would be a great pleasure for me if I could open a new door to understand their thinking.

	I'm 17 years old. I'm in a special biology class. In the future I would like to be a surgeon. I love this competition because it appeals to one of my biggest interest which is molecular biology.

	I am an 18-year-old high school student. I am studying biology at a high level because in the future I want to become a medical doctor. My special interests are anatomy, molecular biology and genetics. I really enjoyed planning and doing the wet lab work since it gave us opportunity to get an insight into the everyday work of a molecular biologist, which was not an everyday experience for us. It was also a great thing to contact people, for example researchers and other iGEM participants and talk to them about the project.

	I am an 18-year old high school student. I am interested in Biology because my desire is to be a medical doctor in the future.  That is why the most attractive topics in Biology for me are Human Anatomy and Physiology. I am glad to have the opportunity to take part in the iGEM competition because it was the first time I felt that I am a part of a creative activity rather than an assessment. By this project I have truly got the experience of working in a world-class laboratory on a project by which we can possibly make a meaningful change. I really enjoyed the experience of contributing to a scientific article, which I think is an important skill to develop. But most importantly, this period trained me to work as a part of a team, thus improving my team working competence.

	I am a 18 years old high school student. I am studying at a science specialised high school, learning the biology at a high level. In the future I would like to work in the field of medicine, for example in psychology. I am partial to botany, zoology and anatomy. It is a great pleasure and privilege for us that we are able to participate in the iGEM competition.

	I am an 17-year-old high school student. I am studying physics and mathematics with strong dedication because in the future I want to become a mechatronics engineer. My special interest is programming. I was thrilled to be working on the design and code of our webpage because I have never done anything practical with my knowledge of programming other than codes for competitions. The other great thing was that I learned a lot in terms of how to work in a group and how to interact with friends when they are also your teammates.

	I am 17 years old, high school student in Szeged. I am studying Maths, and in the future I would like to attend a business university.
	I really enjoyed the competition, because I could use my business skills to make inpact with others.

	I am a 16 years old, high school student in Miklós Radnóti Experimental High School. My studies are specialized for Maths. In the future, I would like to work either as a programmer or a video director. For me iGEM is a very interesting competition with full of challenges. Also it was a great experience to work in team.

	I am 18 years old and currently I am attending a special biology class at high school.  The project gave me a great oppoprtunity to gain insight in how research works. Working in the laboratory was extremely interesting for me, because we were able to carry it out in practise what we formerly had been planning for months. Next year I am applying to Medicine in UK Universities, since my dream is to become a medical doctor.

	I am an 18 years old high school student. I am specialized in biology and phisics, because I want to go to a medical university and later on become a doctor. In our project my task was about putting effort into communication tasks such as outreaches and social media. I really enjoyed that during our work I had to use my problem solving and communication skills. Furthermore I have learned how to accomodate myself to others and how to work with them as a team.
