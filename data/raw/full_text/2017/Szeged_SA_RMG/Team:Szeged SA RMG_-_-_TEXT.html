Introduction
Methane is the second most emitted greenhouse gas with its 10% part in the whole greenhouse gas emission.           Our product would serve as an alternative to the existing infrared Methane Biosensors mostly in: industrial production           (e.g. to help prevent accidents caused by mine explosions); indoor air quality supervision mainly in developing countries where           households are heated by biogas plants; the exploration of yet unknown natural methane sources (e.g. in swamps). In our project           we would like to develop a Methane Biosensor. The sensor itself would be a transformed Bacteria.
Our system is quite basic: if there           is methane (or methanol) in the bacteria's immediate environment, the medium of the bacteria is going to manifest a basic color change
