Team Description
The ECHHS iGEM team is made up of eight high schoolers from East Chapel Hill High School. Our team is composed of eager and science-loving 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. Through iGEM, we have been able to apply our passions for the sciences in a professional lab setting. With the assistance and support of our advisors, we have conducted research at the genetic research lab of UNC-Chapel Hill over the past year.
