Best New Composite Part
We have one new composite part: the Fluoride Riboswitch Regulated Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase Operon.
Schematic of the fluoride riboswitch regulated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP).
Promoter used: BBa_J23100 .
The restriction enzymes sites make it easy to put in new genes using the Gibson Assembly just order your gene of interest with the correct gibson homology overhangs (15-20nts) and cut with the appropriate restriction enzyme.
HindIII = promoter riboswitch segment
XhoI = new genes
This part allows for determining the responsiveness of a fluoride riboswitch and can be used to qualitatively measure fluoride levels. How it works:
Using the Î”crcB E. coli strain, which can accumulate fluoride intracellularly.
The Riboswitch detects fluoride Fluoride activates the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme, which allows for the growth of bacteria on agar plates with the antibiotic chloramphenicol.
This system is amenable for high-throughput screening and can be used to identify fluoride riboswitches with higher affinity to fluoride. However, this system should work with any transcriptional riboswitch.
