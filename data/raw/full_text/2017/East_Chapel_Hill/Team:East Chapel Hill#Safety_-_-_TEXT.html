Lab Safety:
Safety in the lab is our top priority, especially considering that we were dealing with fluoride, a poisonous and toxic substance at concentrated levels.
Our lab work commenced on June 10 and lasted until August 31. Our research was conducted at the Genetic Medicines Building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the supervision of our instructor Dr. Joseph Harrison and advisors Bo Zhao and Minnie Langlois. The following are the safety procedures outlined and followed by our team.
OUR LAB RULES:
One must always safety goggles, powder-free nitrile examination gloves, long pants, closed-toed shoes, and lab coats, before entering the space.
Keep hair tied back at all times.
Use ethanol to disinfect work table.
Supervisors must be present in the lab at all times.
No drinking or eating in the lab space.
Dispose of pipette tips in waste bag.
Have all petri dishes, containers, erlenmeyer flasks, etc. CLEARLY LABELED in order to maintain an organized environment.
