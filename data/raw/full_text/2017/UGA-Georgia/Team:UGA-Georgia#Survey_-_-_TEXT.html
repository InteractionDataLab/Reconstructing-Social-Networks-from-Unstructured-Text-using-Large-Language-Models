Survey
We sent out a high power qualtrics survey to various farmers and students in the region to gauge their understanding and opinions on the             usage of genetically-modified organisms in peanut crop processing. Our survey results showed that although 90%             of our surveyors had heard of GMOs, almost 80% of them had an incorrect understanding of it. However, compared             to usage of pesticides, over 90% preferred having GMOs. Furthermore, with the possibility of Aflatoxin B1 being             present on peanuts, approximately 75% of the surveyors preferred consuming peanuts that were treated with our             GMO Aflatoxin biosensors compared to traditional detection methods. Our survey was graded on a five level Likert Scale with the majority of questions having the following choices:                 Strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree. The survey was correlated                 to a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being the most positive view towards GMOs and 5 being the most negative view                 on GMOs. The average score of 142 participants was 2.81, which was closest to the value of 3, representing                 a neutral stance.
In addition, we asked peanut farmers about their opinion about utilizing GMOs in the business, but majority stated             that they would not utilize GMOs. After evaluating the results, we are seeking to continue educating the public             about GMOs, and peanut farmers on on the safe practice and utilization of GMOs and synthetic biology in the agriculture.
