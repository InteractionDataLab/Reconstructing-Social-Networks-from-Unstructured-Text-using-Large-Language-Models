Experiment
For this experiment, we were given six test devices, a positive control, and a negative control in our Kit Plates             6 and 7. All of the devices coded for GFP except for the negative control which was used to calculate the baseline             for background noise. Each DNA sample was resuspended and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells             using heat shock. After a 1 hour incubation at 200 rpm, the cells were spread onto petri plates containing LB             agar and Chloramphenicol to be incubated again at 37°C overnight. The next morning, the colonies on the 100μl             positive control plate were counted to calculate our competent cell efficiency and verified that our competent             cells had an efficiency that met the iGEM standards (between 1.5x10^8 and 6x10^8 cfu/µg). Single colonies were             picked from each transformation for PCR to verify the part sizes and make glycerol stock.
Immediately following the overnight incubation of the competent cells with the transformed plasmids, 2 colonies were             picked from each plate and inoculated in 5 mL of LB medium and 5µL of Chloramphenicol to grow overnight at 37°C             and 220 rpm. The following day, the cultures were all diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 in 12 mL of LB medium             and Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tubes. The cultures were further incubated at the same conditions as before             with 500µL samples taken at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hour timepoints. The samples were then measured for OD and FI values             in the plate reader. These values were submitted to iGEM using the Google Form links provided on the iGEM website.
NOTE: Prior to utilizing the plate reader, LUDOX-S40 was used to create a single point reference to obtain a ratiometric             conversion factor to transform the absorbance data into a standard OD600 measurement. The plate reader was then             calibrated using a fluorescein fluorescence standard curve using a dilution series of fluorescein. All calibration             steps followed the Interlab 2017 Plate Reader Protocol, officially set by iGEM.
