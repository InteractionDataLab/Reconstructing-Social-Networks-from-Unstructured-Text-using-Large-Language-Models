Conclusion
From our data, it is clear that the final biosensor (E3R) has fluorescence without the prescence of toxin, AFB1. This background fluorescence, stemming from imperfect repression, was low enough when compared to the max theoretical fluorescence (E3) that there existed a wide enough range to see a response to AFB1 if this response exists. Though there existed a wide enough range to observe a response, no response was observed. This was the case even when particularly high levels of the toxin were utilized (up to 10 ppm). This could suggest that the affinity of the repressor for AFB1 is prohibitively low as compared to the affinity of the repressor for the expressor. It also might suggest that the cytoplasmic conditions are inhibitory when it comes to the interaction between the repressor and AFB1.
