University of Georgia iGem Team 2017
Collaboration Study
In an effort to work together and support another iGEM team, we teamed up with Lambert High School in Georgia. During             our data collection period, we invited the members on their team to collect their data as well using our plate             reader. By extending the courtesy of the UGA research labs, we facilitated meaningful interaction between Lambert             and UGA and subsequently developed a strong, healthy relationship that can allow both teams to succeed in the             future. That said, by sharing our previous experiences from iGEM, we helped Lambert develop a more efficient             protocol for data collection in the interlab study.
