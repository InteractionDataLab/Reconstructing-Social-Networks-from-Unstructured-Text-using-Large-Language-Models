A Simple GFP Expressor was devised from basic parts found from the iGEM Registry (including a promoter , a RBS , GFP , and a terminator ). The only component not taken from the Registry was a DNA sequence complementary to the AFB1 aptamer.
A Repressor sequence incorporating the AFB1 aptamer was also devised that utilized the same promoter as the expressor. No protein is encoded for from the repressor, but the transcript produced is able to inhibit translation of the expressor by occluding the RBS.
To realize a working biosensor, we hope to eliminate repression with the introduction of AFB1. This may require modifications to the cDNA region of the expressor to change the affinity of the repressor for the expressor relative to its affinity to AFB1
