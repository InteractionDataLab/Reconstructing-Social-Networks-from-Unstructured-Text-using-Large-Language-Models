Our team is
            working to create a biosensor for aflatoxin B1 (fungal toxin) in peanuts, as our home state produces 45% of the
            U.S. peanut crop and is the number one producer for peanuts in the United States. Aflatoxin is a major concern
            for peanut producers as it has serious health implications as a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound. One of
            the primary ways in which Aflatoxin B1 is controlled or detected in peanut crops is through the physical separation
            of contaminated peanuts. In the interest of making a cost-effective impact, our team will be creating a biosensor
            that will brightly fluoresce or change color when Aflatoxin B1 is detected. This will make color sorting and
            separation of the contaminated peanuts much easier and reduce the economic impact of this fungal toxin on one
            of Georgia’s biggest agricultural industries. This approach is unique as we will be working to genetically modify
            bacteria to detect this toxin. This modified organism will be a much cheaper alternative to the status quo, which
            requires high cost, specialized equipment to sort out the contaminated peanuts.

            In general, translation is controlled through the sequestration of the ribosome binding site (RBS) from the ribosome,
            usually accomplished through the formation of secondary structures involving complementary base binding within
            the mRNA molecule itself. Alternatively, in a two-component aptameric system, this can be accomplished through
            the use of RNA aptamers and their complementary bases.</P><H5>A Two Component Aptameric Riboswitch</H5><P>An aptameric sequence is a nucleic acid sequence with high affinity for a given regulator molecule. Thus, in a two-component
            system, the regulatory molecule may compete with the aptamer’s cDNA for binding to the aptamer. If the affinity
            for the regulator is higher than the aptamer’s affinity for its cDNA, the cDNA will be released, thereby allowing
            translation to occur on the protein encoding strand. </P><H5>Generation of a Biosensor for Aflatoxin B1</H5><P>This year, UGA’s iGEM utilized this form of aptameric riboswitch to attempt to create a biosensor for detection of
            Aflatoxin B1 (fungal toxin) in peanuts. Building off of the work of Wang et. al (2016), we created several
            RNA-based “expressor” constructs consisting of a constitutive promoter, cDNA to the aptamer, an RBS, and a GFP
            reporter. We also created a “repressor” sequence by incorporating an RNA version of Wang et. al’s aptameric sequence
            from his 2016 study along with an anti-RBS and constitutive promoter. We hypothesized that when cotransformed
            these RNA molecules would be bound using complementary pairing. However, upon the introduction of aflatoxin,
            the repressor’s aptameric sequence would bind preferentially to the toxin, releasing the GFP transcript to be
            translated. </P></DIV><DIV class="column half_size"><H1>The Impact</H1><P>Our team is working to create a biosensor for aflatoxin B1 (fungal toxin) in peanuts, as our home state is the number one producer for peanuts in the United States. Aflatoxin is a major

            may be reduced, allowing food supplies at the local, national, and international level to be increased through
            the production of novel food processing technologies.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
