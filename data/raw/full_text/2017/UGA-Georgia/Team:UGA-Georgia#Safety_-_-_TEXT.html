Safety
All team members were certified for Biosafety Practices and Procedures in BSL-2 labs at UGA before lab work was permitted.  Training regarding blood-borne pathogens and hazardous wastes was completed, as well as right-to-know training. E. coli has a low virulence factor, but aseptic techniques were always used when handling live culture. Agarose gel analysis of DNA was primarily performed with SYBR safe stain and always imaged safely in a gel doc. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) staining was performed safely with proper containment and disposal. Protective eyewear was used for visualizing fluorescence of cultures.  Aflatoxin B1 was supplied by Dr. Jia-Sheng Wangâ€™s lab, which is specialized to work with aflatoxin in a safe environment.  Precautions for handling and disposal of aflatoxin were carried out according to their standard operating procedures. Our lab followed the safety and hazardous waste standards of the USDA's Mycotoxin Handbook, which details the necessary workspace and safe lab practices. The link to the handbook can be found here.
