3A Assembly
1. Digestion
A 25 µL master mix was prepared for both of the inserts. The backbone plasmid was already precut, but to cut backbone plasmids EcoRI-HF and PstI would be used (the same volume).
Enzyme Master Mix for the first insert:
NEB Buffer 2
5 µL
EcoRI-HF
0.5 µL
SpeI
0.5 µL
Milliq
19 µL
4 µL of the master mix was then mixed with 4 µL of the enzyme.
Enzyme Master Mix for the second insert:
NEB Buffer 2
5 µL
XBaI
0.5 µL
PstI
0.5 µL
Milliq
19 µL
4 µL of the master mix was then mixed with 4 µL of the enzyme.
Both digestion mixtures were digested at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The mixtures were then left at 80 °C for 20 minutes to heat kill the enzymes. These steps were performed in a PCR machine.
2. Ligation
In this step it is important to have equimolar amount of cut plasmid backbone and digest product. In our case the length of everything was very similar, therefore the same volumes could be used, however that can always be done. The total reaction volume is 10 µL
Ligation Mixture:
Plasmid backbone
2 µL
Enzyme insert cut at E and S
2 µL
Enzyme insert cut at X and P

The mixture was then ligated at 16 °C for 30 minutes. Another heat kill around at 80 °C for 20 minutes was then performed.
For the transformation step see the Phusion PCR, Gibson Assembly and Transformation protocol.

Lysate preparation
1. Grow an overnight culture of the donor strain (with selection if needed).
2. Inoculate 2 x 4 ml P1 LB medium in 50 ml tubes with 50µl culture per tube.
DO NOT ADD ANTIBIOTICS!
Grow shaking with aeration at 37 ˚C for 1-1.3 h. When the cells are in early log phase (slightly turbid, but noticeable growth), add 100 µL of P1 phage lysate to one of the cultures, continue growing at 37 ˚C. Monitor for 1–4 h, and when the culture has lysed, transfer the cells in the other tube to 2 ml tubes, spin down the cells and resuspend them in 200 µl P1 LB. Add the resuspended cells to the lysed tube and continue growing at 37 ˚C. Monitor for 1–4 h until the culture has lysed.
3. Transfer lysate to 2 ml tubes, and add 100 µl of chloroform to the lysate and vortex 10 sec. Centrifuge away the debris (13000 rpm, 2 min) and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Add a few drops of chloroform and store at 4 ˚C.
P1 transduction
1. Grow recipient overnight in P1 LB (1 ml culture per transduction).
2. Add 75 μl donor P1 lysate to 400 μl culture of the recipient strain, mix, and incubate the tubes in a 37 ˚C water bath for 30 min.
6. Spin cells at 6000 rpm for 5 min, remove supernatant carefully and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL Na-citrate LB, vortex well to disperse cells, and plate all of it on an appropriate antibiotic-containing plate.
8. You should get anywhere from ~ 10 to 2000 colonies. These colonies are growing on a plate that is covered with P1 phage, so use a toothpick to touch the top of a few colonies and re-streak on new selective plates for isolated colonies.
9. Test a colony from each re-streak for the presence of the mutant gene you intended to transduce using PCR.
P1 transduction
E. coli:
DA24100 Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 /pSIM5-Tet Lambda Red system TetR This strain carries the pSIM5-tet plasmid, see above. Grow at 30°C, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline.
1. Grow strain O/N at 30°C in Salt Free LB (with appropriate antibiotic).
2. Dilute 1:100 in 30°C pre-warmed Salt Free LB (with appropriate antibiotic for pSIM5/pSIM5-Tet/pSIM6/pSIM-ctx) in a 500ml E-flask. 50 ml is enough for 4-8 electroporations.
3. Grow at 30°C shaking until OD600 ≈ 0.3-0.4 (1.5~2 hrs).
4. To induce red expression, move the flask to a 42°C shaking waterbath, incubate with slow shaking (110 rpm) for 15 minutes.
5. Cool cells on ice for at least 10 minutes. Swirl carefully to cool cells.
6. Transfer cells to cold 50 ml tubes and spin down the cells (4500 rpm, 8 min., 4°C).
7. Remove as much as possible of the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 µl ice cold sterile water using a 10 µl loop. Add 12 ml ice cold water and pipette up and down a few times (using the pipette-boy). Do not vortex! Pellet the cells at 4500 rpm, 6-10 min, 4°C and repeat the wash one more time.
8. Resuspend the cells in ice-cold 10% glycerol (as small volume as you need, ~300 µl).
9. Mix 40 μl cells and DNA in an electroporation cuvette on ice (2-8 µl de-salted PCR product or up to half of what you get from a normal 20 μl PCR reaction, 100-500 ng.
10. Electroporate (2.5 kV 200 Ω, 25 µF). Immediately resuspend the cells in 1 ml 42°C SOC or SOB and transfer to 10 ml plastic tubes.
11. Optional: Incubate the cells in a 42°C water bath for 10 minutes.
12. Let the cells recover for at least 3 hrs or overnight in a 30°C shaking incubator.
13. Plate on appropriate selective medium, incubate the plates at 30°C O/N.
14. Restreak colonies on selective medium at 42°C. Test for loss of the plasmid. (Consider freezing a clone that still contains the pSIM-plasmid.)
Extracting zeaxanthin from E. coli strain and TLC
1. Pick a colony and grow in LB overnight in 30°C in shaking incubator.
2. For an analytical extraction, spin down 10 mL cells and lyse with 1 mL acetic acid.
3. Pour 1 mL toluen and 1 mL H2O into the tube to create a two-phase separation. Spin down. Take the upper organic phase into a new tube and evaporate under vacuum until a yellow pigment powder is visible. Resolve in 10 uL toluen and measure the absorbance spectra on nanodrop.
4. Run thin layer chromatography (TLC) on a silica coated aluminum plate with 90% chloroform and 10% ethanol as mobile phase.
