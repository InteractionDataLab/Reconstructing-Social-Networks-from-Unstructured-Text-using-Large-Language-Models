We identified and created sequence verified BioBricks out of three enzymes that can perform the three step conversion from zeaxanthin to crocin: CaCCD2, CsADH2946 and UGTCs2. We have also characterized these enzymes with experiments and simulations. Above all, we are the first to purify and confirm activity of CsADH2946 as well as measuring the kinetic parameters of the enzyme (K<SUB>M</SUB> = 20.7842 µM ± 3.5264). In addition, we performed steered molecular dynamics (pulling) with CsADH2946 and the substrate crocetin dialdehyde, which showed that CsADH2946 has a high affinity towards the substrate. Our experimental data and modeling results show that CsADH2946 is a very good enzyme for this crocin pathway reaction. </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row title"><DIV class="col-xs-10"><DIV> Step 1: Zeaxanthin → Crocetin dialdehyde</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row text"><DIV class="col-xs-10"><DIV>The gene for CaCCD2 (<I>Crocus Ancyrensis</I> carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 2) wasn’t discovered until 2014 (1) with further studies from 2015 (2), and has not been used by any iGEM team previously. Other iGEM teams have used another gene (ZCD) to make crocetin dialdehyde but the enzyme was malfunctioning for this reaction. We instead identified and used CaCCD2: a perfect candidate for our pathway. We successfully made a sequence verified BioBrick of CaCCD2 with his-tag (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Parts">BBa_K2423005</A>). The BioBrick was also combined with the other steps in the pathway and inserted into the zeaxanthin producing <I>E. coli</I> strain for a complete pathway from FPP to crocin.

We used a gradient of imidazole concentration from 20–500 mM, in order to get our enzyme as separated as possible from other proteins that ended up in the fractions. The peak highlighted by the arrow in the chromatogram (figure 2) indicates protein that elutes at high imidazole concentration, i.e. our desired his-tagged CsADH2946. The purification was followed by SDS-PAGE to analyse the fractions, control purity and verify the protein product. In figure 3a the band at around 60 kDa in the crude pellet indicates an overexpression of a protein in that size range. In the SDS gel of fractions 16–26 collected between 115–145 mL elution volume (figure 3b) there is a strong band at 60 kDa corresponding to the molecular weight of CsADH2946, indicating that our protein was successfully overexpressed and well-separated.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row text"><DIV class="col-xs-6"><FIGURE class="figure"><FIGCAPTION class="figure-caption figtext" style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2%;"> Figure 2.

The negative and positive control curves look similar to time point zero, apart from some precipitation of product and substrate indicated by the decreased curves — definite evidence that we succeeded to produce a functional CsADH2946 enzyme.
