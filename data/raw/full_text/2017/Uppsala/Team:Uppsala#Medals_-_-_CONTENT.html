Coli</I>. We validated all three enzyme BioBricks by sequencing (<A style="color:#4f4f4f;" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2423005">BBa_K2423005</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2423008" style="color:#4f4f4f">BBa_K2423008</A>). The BioBrick with CsADH <A href="">(BBa_K2423007)</A> was, is in addition to sequencing verified by SDS-PAGE and activity assay.

This year our most notable collaboration was a panel discussion we organized with iGEM Stockholm where more than 100 people participated. But we also worked with iGEM Lund to help them with their first year, organized webinars, made postcard and more! You can read about our collaborations on our <A style="color:#4f4f4f" href="2017.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Collaborations">Collaborations</A> page. </LI><LI>Human Practices This year we decided to focus most of our Human Practice on ethics in science and having fun as a team. We started off by doing a market analysis to see the potential market value. The Ethics package we constructed can be found on our <A style="color:#4f4f4f;" href=" https://2017.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/HP/Gold_Integrated">Ethics</A> page, here it can be seen how we put our package to practice and where we looked at different ethical aspects of our project idea and decided accordingly.

In this we first went to experts to discuss ethical issues of our project. Then we talked to the iGEM community in our webinars and lastly we reached out to general public in our panel discussion and lectures. Out of all these parts and our own research we compiled Ethical guidelines for iGEM teams with a list of questions that every iGEM team should answer to ethically asses their project.

</LI><LI>Improve a previous Part or Project  This year we were working with several parts from previous iGEM projects. Most notably with Zeaxanthine strain from iGEM Slovenia 2010 <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K323122" style="color:#4f4f4f;">(BBa_K323122)</A>. We decided that the production was too unstable in such a large plasmid and adding more steps to it would be too risky. Therefore, we used lambda red recombeenering to add the parts into the chromosome. You can read more about this part of the project at the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Zea-Strain" style="color:#4f4f4f;">Zeaxanthin</A> page. Another improvement to a previous BioBrick is <A style="color:#4f4f4f;" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2423008">BBa_K2423008</A> which is an improved version of <A style="color:#4f4f4f;" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1033112">BBa_K1033112</A> developed by iGEM Uppsala 2013. We decided to optimize codons of the BioBrick, add His-tag linker to ensure proper folding and easier purification and to add two stop codons to make transcription smoother and more effective. You can read more in our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Results" style="color:#4f4f4f">Results page</A>.

In addition, we were only able to find enzymatic parameters concerning one of the enzymes, UGTCs2. Via homology modeling we could draw the conclusion that UGTCs2 and CaCCD2 are monomers while CsADH2946 is a tetramer. We could also ensure that the N-terminal was facing outward from the protein and could safely put a His-tag there for purification. Furthermore, the extensive 100 ns molecular dynamics  (MD) simulation of our models verified that the models were stable in solvent and that we could further work with the models to estimate the binding affinity between enzyme and substrate. Steered molecular dynamics simulations showed that CsADH2946 is specific to its substrate crocetin dialdehyde and that it has an affinity in the µM range to the substrate. The estimation of K<SUB>M</SUB> from the experimental activity measurements also showed that CsADH2946 has a high affinity towards the substrate crocetin dialdehyde, in agreement with Steered Molecular Dynamics results. All modeling results show that CsADH2946 is a very good enzyme for usage in the crocin pathway and thus in our project. Read all about how modeling contributed to our project in the <A style="color:#4f4f4f;" href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/Model"> Modeling</A> page</LI><LI>Demonstrate your work We successfully integrated the first five steps of the crocin pathway from FPP to zeaxanthin into the E. coli chromosome. The result is a E. coli strain expressing zeaxanthin. We have created sequence verified BioBricks of our enzymes in the extended crocin pathway: CaCCD2, CsADH2946 and UGTCs2. We have also characterized these enzymes with experiments and simulations. We are the first to purify and confirm activity of CsADH2946 as well as measuring the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. We created and combined the zeaxanthin producing strain with a plasmid containing the extended crocin pathway which gave us an E. coli strain including the entire production pathway from FPP to crocin.
