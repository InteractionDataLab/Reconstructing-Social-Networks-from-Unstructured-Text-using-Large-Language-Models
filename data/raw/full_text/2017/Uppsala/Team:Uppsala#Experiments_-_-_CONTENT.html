6 µL 10X “FastDigest” Buffer
1) Incubate reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 hour
2) Purify the DNA in the mixture with “PureLink Quick PCR Purification Kit” (Invitrogen). Milliq was used instead of TE buffer when eluting the DNA from the spin column in the final step of the DNA purification. The optional washing step was skipped
3) Measure the DNA concentration on Nanodrop in units of ng/µL. 2 µL was used for each measurement
4) Store the DNA at -20 °C until further use

Grow shaking with aeration at 37 ˚C for 1-1.3 h. When the cells are in early log phase (slightly turbid, but noticeable growth), add 100 µL of P1 phage lysate to one of the cultures, continue growing at 37 ˚C. Monitor for 1–4 h, and when the culture has lysed, transfer the cells in the other tube to 2 ml tubes, spin down the cells and resuspend them in 200 µl P1 LB. Add the resuspended cells to the lysed tube and continue growing at 37 ˚C. Monitor for 1–4 h until the culture has lysed.

3. Transfer lysate to 2 ml tubes, and add 100 µl of chloroform to the lysate and vortex 10 sec. Centrifuge away the debris (13000 rpm, 2 min) and transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. Add a few drops of chloroform and store at 4 ˚C.<B>P1 transduction</B>

6. Spin cells at 6000 rpm for 5 min, remove supernatant carefully and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL Na-citrate LB, vortex well to disperse cells, and plate all of it on an appropriate antibiotic-containing plate.
8. You should get anywhere from ~ 10 to 2000 colonies. These colonies are growing on a plate that is covered with P1 phage, so use a toothpick to touch the top of a few colonies and re-streak on new selective plates for isolated colonies.
9. Test a colony from each re-streak for the presence of the mutant gene you intended to transduce using PCR.</DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6 dalek"><B>P1 transduction</B><I>E. coli</I>:

7. Remove as much as possible of the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 100 µl
ice cold sterile water using a 10 µl loop. Add 12 ml ice cold water and pipette up and down a few times (using the pipette-boy). Do not vortex! Pellet the cells at 4500 rpm, 6-10 min, 4°C and repeat the wash one more time.
8. Resuspend the cells in ice-cold 10% glycerol (as small volume as you need, ~300 µl).
9. Mix 40 μl cells and DNA in an electroporation cuvette on ice (2-8 µl de-salted PCR product or up to half of what you get from a normal 20 μl PCR reaction, 100-500 ng.
