We successfully integrated the first five steps of the crocin pathway from FPP to zeaxanthin into the E. coli chromosome. The result is a E. coli strain expressing zeaxanthin. We have created sequence verified BioBricks of our enzymes in the extended crocin pathway: CaCCD2, CsADH2946 and UGTCs2. We have also characterized these enzymes with experiments and simulations. We are the first to purify and confirm activity of CsADH2946 as well as measuring the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. We created and combined the zeaxanthin producing strain with a plasmid containing the extended crocin pathway which gave us an E. coli strain including the entire production pathway from FPP to crocin.
