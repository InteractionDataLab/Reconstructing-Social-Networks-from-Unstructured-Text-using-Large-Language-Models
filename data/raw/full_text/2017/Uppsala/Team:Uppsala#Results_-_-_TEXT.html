Summary
We successfully integrated the first five steps of the crocin pathway from FPP to zeaxanthin into the E. coli chromosome. The result is a E. coli strain expressing zeaxanthin. We have created sequence verified BioBricks of our enzymes in the extended crocin pathway: CaCCD2 ( BBa_K2423005 ), CsADH2946 ( BBa_K2423007 ) and UGTCs2 ( BBa_K2423008 ). We have also characterized these enzymes with experiments and simulations.
to purify and confirm activity of CsADH2946 as well as measuring the kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
Figure 1. Top: Wild-type E. coli. Bottom: Zeaxanthin producing E. coli strain with 5 genes inserted into the chromosome.
We created and combined the zeaxanthin producing strain with a plasmid containing the extended crocin pathway which gave us an E. coli strain including the entire production pathway from FPP to crocin. In the end, we were able to identify, create and extensively characterize the pathway for crafting crocin.
Chromosomal integration:
Farnesyl Pyrophosphate (FPP) → Zeaxanthin
Successfully integrated five genes from FPP to zeaxanthin into the chromosome of E. coli.
Successfully transformed the  crocin pathway into the zeaxanthin producing strain
Extracted zeaxanthin from the zeaxanthin producing strain
