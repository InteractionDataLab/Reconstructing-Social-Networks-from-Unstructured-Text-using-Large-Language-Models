MEMBERS
Teresa Reinli
She is our project manager alongside Lucie. Teresa comes from Sweden and is studying Master in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. Her favorite lab equipment is the microscope because, “When you look into it, you see a whole new world. There are so many tiny organisms and it is difficult to imagine something so small. Just fascinating!”

Lucie Kulhankova
One of our project managers comes from Czech and she is studying Master in Applied Biotechnology at Uppsala University. We asked Lucie a scenario where she could get a superpower after an incident in the lab, and she would like to have the ability to adjust concentration and pH of any solution! She said that it would save her a lot of heartbreak and frustration in the lab.

Tobias Luckey
A master student in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University coming from Sweden. Tobias is a part of our modeling group. His first thought about biotechnology is that it was cool. “Not only discovering the complex systems which constitute life but also engineering them in inventive ways in other contexts to solve complex problems in previously unthinkable ways. This is cool.”
Siri Norlander
Siri is a master student in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University, she is also a part of our modeling group. We asked her why lab coats are white, and she replied with, "Are they supposed to be white?"
Oscar Broström
A master student from Sweden in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. Oscar takes part in our modeling group and thinks that Miro is traveling in your suitcase. He also thinks Quattro stagioni (four seasons) pizza represents our team well since we have people from all around the world with different backgrounds. However, he never had that pizza yet.
Janis Kronbergs
The only Latvian in the group. He studies Master in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. As a part of our modeling group, he thinks that the Swedish Battle Hamster is his spirit animal. Kidding. “On a more serious note: Turtle. Why? Because I took an online test, and it said so - or because, ultimately, everything serves the Beam. Alternatively, an elephant because...just, because, d*mmit! (That's me really wanting to be Elephant, but not being able to come up with a justification).”
Tatiana Väcklén
Taya studies Biomedical Laboratory Science program. She comes from Russia and contributes in our modeling group. Her favorite language is English (apart from her native language) because it is nice when everybody can understand each other no matter where they come from :)
Sreekar Wunnava Venkata
He studies Masters in Biology (Cell and Molecular) at Uppsala University. Coming all the way from India, Sree takes part in our wiki group. He thinks that this team resembles fruitcake because it’s a mixed bunch, sweet and sour… but makes a good cake.
Stella Belin
The only heroine in our wiki group. Stella comes from Sweden and is studying Master in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. She chose to join iGEM because she likes being in the lab. Also, for the fun experience             to be a part of a big project which she enjoyed from the start of choosing the project until the implementation
Björn Greijer
Björn studies Master in Applied Biotechnology at Uppsala University. He belongs to the wiki group and comes from Sweden. If he did not know anything about iGEM, he would think that it stands for Interdimensional Gene Editing Magic.
Arindam De Tarafder
He is currently doing his Master in Applied Biotechnology at Uppsala University and comes all the way from India. Arindam joins the forces in our wiki group. He foresees biotechnology in the next five years as a booming biotech sector with             an emphasis on applied research. Hopefully, by then the common public is taken into confidence regarding the benefits of biotechnology, leading to a positive public perception for biotechnological applications.
Ylva Jansson
A master student from Sweden studying Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. Ylva is a part of our human practices group.

Jennifer Johansson
She is also a part of our human practices group and comes from Sweden. Jennifer studies Master in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. Her favorite part of working in the lab is the possibility to apply theoretical             knowledge and it is encouraging to face new challenges. It is also exciting to see the results of an experiment after many, long hours of lab work.
Linda Larsson
Linda comes from Sweden and is currently studying at Uppsala University for her Bachelor in Biology/Microbiology. She is part of our human practices group. Celebration by Kool & The Gang is the song that she chooses for our theme song, “because we always had good times in the lab”.
Friederike Mey
Rike comes from Germany and studies Master in Biology at Uppsala University. As a part of our human practice group, she would like to be Dicrocoelium dendriticum, a fluke that is able to infect ants’ ganglions, manipulating them into sitting             on the tip of grass. That rises the chances of the ant being eaten by an oblivious sheep, the final host of the fluke. “I think it would cool to travel inside an ant!”
Miro Plum
He studies the Master in Infection Biology at Uppsala University. Miro is from Germany and a part of our human practices group. He would have preferred to do his Schistosoma project or to watch Tardigrades all day long. He is also probably             covered in bacteriophages and molds. RIP Joffrey and Little Finger (our pet stick animals) ...it was Linda's fault.
Immanuel Sanka
All the way from Indonesia to study Master in Applied Biotechnology at Uppsala University. Sanka is a part of our human practices group. An advice that he would like to give to himself nine months ago is, “beware with anything which is unpredictable, especially doing research with the tiny creature called microbes! :D”
Made Sania Saraswati
She studies Master in Sustainable Development at Uppsala University and SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences). Sania comes from Indonesia and contributes in our graphic design group. She joined our team because she wanted to see if the results on Google match with the reality when she types ‘scientist’ on the search box.
Adrianna Pakuła
Coming from Poland, Adrianna comes to Uppsala University to study Master in Applied Biotechnology. She takes part in our graphic design group. We asked her on how to describe our project to a 10-year-old and she answered with, “We politely ask bacteria to help us to make a red dye. They weren't too content with that, but after discussing the topic properly, we agreed on a set of conditions, that allowed us to produce a protein in a petri dish, take it from them & purify it.”
Hugo Swenson
A master student in Molecular Biotechnology Engineering at Uppsala University. Hugo comes from Sweden and is a part of our graphic design group. Unfortunately, he has no idea on the hex code for the colour of crocin. He apologizes for this.
Saffy
Saffy is the latest member of the iGEM Uppsala Association. Saffy likes to hang out with MooMoo and Pinky in the B5:BMC Lab!
