iGEM Uppsala-Attributions
Attributions
This page is dedicated towards the amazing people who helped out in this project in various ways. You are highly regarded by everyone on the iGEM Uppsala 2017 team, and have our eternal gratitude. We have many people to thank. From our families and friends that have listened to our highs and lows during the competition to all of the people that showed up to our events. Unfortunately, we cannot name every single person specifically but here you can read names of the people that we simply could never omit. We would of course like to extend our gratitude to all of those who did not fit to this page and to everyone in iGEM HQ who are working tirelessly to make the whole iGEM possible for us.
Professor/Advisors
Our appreciation goes to Anders Virtanen, Anthony Forster, Michael Nissbäck, Sethu Madhava Rao Gunja, Margareta Krabbe and Gunnar Johansson for their valuable feedback and their guidance during this project.
We would also like to thank lab assistants Sangeeta Boopalan and Delyan Georgiev. that helped us during the summer to get started in the lab.
A special thank you to Emil Marklund (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University) for all the guidance, the tremendous amount of help and dedication for making us successful in the project: “a once in a lifetime opportunity!”. Lastly, we are also very grateful to Elf lab for providing lab space and equipment during autumn.
Our team would also like to express a special appreciation and thanks to Erik Wistrand-Yuen (Department of Medical Biochemsitry and Microbiology, Uppsala University) who provided us with the lambda red starting strains, the protocols and who spent hours guiding and instructing us and providing practical help. Without him this success would not have been possible.
Seniors
During our iGEM run we got a lot of support from old iGEMers. We would like to thank everyone who have attended our lectures and given us guidance and opinions while picking our project. We would also like to thank the iGEM Uppsala Association board for organizing events and supporting us at the beginning of the project. Namely we would like to thank the previous iGEM Uppsala members Olle Karlberg, Fredrik Lindeberg, Alice Anlind, Sabri Jamal and Hampus Elofsson, we thank you for your guidance.
Human Practice
Thank to Alexander Kinigalakis and the whole team at Drivhuset for amazing workshops.
For the participation of Ethics Online Discussion, we would like to thank: iGEM ETH Zurich, iGEM Groningen, iGEM Lund, iGEM UiOslo, iGEM NAWI Graz, iGEM Chalmers Gothenburg, iGEM USyd, iGEM USP-Brazil, iGEM Toronto, iGEM Peshawar, iGEM Bielefeld-CeBiTec, iGEM CSU, iGEM Wageningen, iGEM Technion, iGEM DTU-Denmark, and iGEM Grenoble.
We would like to thank our amazing panelists Anthony C. Forster, Cecile van der Vlugt and Heidi Howard for participating in our ethics discussion. Also Mirko Ancilloti and Stephan Eriksson for their time while answering our ethics questions. Lastly thanks to Per Kjellin and Olivia Tolan who gave us advice on IPR.
Modeling
Big thanks for the workshop on basics of homology modeling and molecular dynamics taught by Hugo Gutierrez. Also, David Fange for an introduction to basic pathway modeling. We also got help from Tobias Jakobsson who installed Gromacs on the university computers and provided us with accounts to run overnight simulations. Lastly, thanks to Emil Marklund (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University) for the concrete guidance on GROMACS molecular dynamics and kinetic modeling.
Chip
Henrik Boije for giving the PDMS curing agent. Maja Hellsing Lab Group for helping the team get the 3D resin prints, especially Adam Engberg and Olle Eriksson who was very helpful in printing the chip template. Rahmanu Hermawan who taught the group to program the Arduino and assembly the automatic heat source. Marcus Holm who help the team to get access to UPPMAX supercomputer of Uppsala for chipengineering simulations. Nikos Fatsis-Kavalopoulos and Rodrigo Hernández Vera for their advice and help in allowing the team to use the plasma bond equipment.
GoFoundMe
Last but not least, a big appreciation for our donors in the fundraising: Oliver Beste, Emilia Larsson, Andrea Zilla, Giulia Zilla, Kaari Broström, Wiktor Gustafsson, Anita Bergquist, Eva Jansson, Jonas Broström, Petter Forsberg, Fredrik Lindeberg, Julia Mey, bobo horp, Kerstin Norlander, Olov Norlander, and two people who wanted to remain anonymous.
