We asked Lucie a scenario where she could get a superpower after an incident in the lab, and she would like to have the ability to adjust concentration and pH of any solution! She said that it would save her a lot of heartbreak and frustration in the lab.

His first thought about biotechnology is that it was cool. “Not only discovering the complex systems which constitute life but also engineering them in inventive ways in other contexts to solve complex problems in previously unthinkable ways. This is cool.”
