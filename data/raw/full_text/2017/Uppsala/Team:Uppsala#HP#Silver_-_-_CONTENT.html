Integration between science and the public is key for any development. </DIV><DIV class="bla2" style="color: #4D4D4D;">Since our team holds a special interest in ethics, we chose that as a core of our Human Practice work. We started by doing a market analysis to see the potential of our project in this area. Next, an ethics package was constructed by discussing ethical issues of our project with experts, talking to the iGEM community in webinars and by reaching out to the general public in a panel discussion and by having lectures. Out of these parts we compiled ethical guidelines for iGEM teams. Other than this our team has participated in different events to reach out to a lot of people with different backgrounds and talk about our project. These events are: OpenHack in Uppsala, Nordic iGEM Conference in Copenhagen and Global Community Bio Summit in Boston. Our team also had the chance to engage with exchange students from universities in China.

Before going through with our project we wanted to make sure that we were actually doing something worthwhile, so we started off by doing a market analysis to confirm that there is a market for crocin. 
</DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #00B5B5;"> With the market analysis we concluded that the compounds in the crocin pathway are very expensive, since today the only way to get them is to extract them from saffron. Saffron itself is harvested in a very labour-intensive process and Iran holds 95 % of the saffron production. This means that being able to produce the compounds synthetically could reduce the costs drastically. It’s hard to calculate exactly by how much the cost could be reduced since crocin is still very unexplored, but when comparing our project to a study done on cellulase enzymes we can estimate that a reduction of the price by 30 % might be possible and furthermore a reduction of 85 % might be possible on the industrial scale. These numbers definitely encouraged us to go ahead with the project. </DIV><DIV class="bla2" style="color: #00B5B5;"> You can read the entire market analysis <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/d/d8/Uppsala-Market-analysis.pdf" target="_blank"> here</A>.

We felt that we lacked the proper tools to fully and properly investigate an issue that is so important and yet so neglected in biological sciences. So we came up with the idea of writing down some helpful ethical guidelines ourselves, where the experience from our academic background came together into four parts of ethical question sets that we find important to address: intellectual property, work ethics, biosafety with genetic engineering and social responsibility. </DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #FFFFFF"> We consulted Heidi Howards from the Centre for Research Ethics and Bioethics and to our delight she agreed on helping us with her professional input for setting up guidelines. Our ambition is to motivate each and every iGEM team to accept their manifold ethical responsibilities and be able to state an elaborate declaration regarding their specific work. All of this boiled down into a booklet that introduces these four types of ethics every researcher will be confronted with, and summarizes it with a few questions that every iGEM team, in our opinion, should be able to answer. By this we want to contribute to the need of responsible researchers and a dearly needed open discussion. </DIV><DIV class="bla2" style="color: #FFFFFF"> To improve our work, we held online discussions with 15 other iGEM teams, where we could test our drafted questions and were lucky to receive great feedback, allowing us to develop the topic further. We also held a Reddit AMA to answer user questions regarding our specific topic and, as expected, were also confronted with ethical questions that the non-scientific audience might have. We incorporated every input we could collect and are proud to present the results of a summer’s work on bioethics in <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2017/d/de/Uppsala-Ethics-booklet.pdf" target="_blank"> The Ethics Guide Book</A>.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel"><DIV class="panel-heading head3"><H4 class="panel-title"><A data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion" href="#collapse3">

So instead of only saying this, we decided to start an actual discussion. This was also a perfect opportunity to connect to other iGEM teams and thereby contribute to the community with collaborations. </DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #D4D4D4"> Since iGEM teams are spread out all over the world we concluded that the best way to do this was over the internet. We set up a structure for online discussions using Google Hangouts. We planned for three occasions, with topics based on the chapters in The Ethics Guide Book. All discussions were closely related to what we consider important to every team's work during iGEM and therefore relevant to each participating team. To further broaden the accessibility we decided to broadcast each session live, making it possible for anyone that is interested to follow the discussion and comment. </DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #D4D4D4"> All three sessions can be found on our <A href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7GPw3UhMro-eN__6NNOLUg">YouTube-page</A>and the questions being addressed are from the correlating chapter in The Ethics Guide Book </DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #D4D4D4; padding-left:1.5em;"><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOuFtJZxDf0">Genetic Engineering Topic</A></DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #D4D4D4; padding-left:1.5em;"><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHIO7Ios2uc&amp;t=904s">Social Responsibility Topic</A></DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #D4D4D4; padding-left:1.5em;"><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjnm4SBAHcs&amp;t=117s">Intellectual Property Rights Topic</A></DIV><DIV class="bla2" style="color: #D4D4D4"> From the discussions, iGEM Uppsala achieved a lot of insight from the 15 participating iGEM teams.

To learn more about the legal parts of this we turned to Uppsala Innovation Centre for help. There we met with the lawyers Per Kjellin and Olivia Tolan, who could answer questions about our rights and discuss pros and cons. For example a patent would enable a protected environment for developing of our product but it would also limit the potential research opportunities. In the end we decided to not go ahead with the patenting but it was our research on the topic that made us able to take an informed decision, and we are now more educated on how to possibly proceed with another project in the future.

It became a tradition that the next NIC is hosted by the team that wins the best presentation contest during the meetup. This year, teams have met in Copenhagen at an event hosted by iGEM UCopenhagen. During the first day we bonded over games and activities provided by the team. The second day was spent with lectures informing us about with various issues that we might run into during iGEM competition such as communication with media or ethical issues. Each team also presented their project and gained feedback from iGEM judges on how to address possible critical issues they might run into. Lively discussion continued until late night hours with a BBQ dinner prepared. The award for best presentation this year went to the newest team in the Nordic iGEM world: iGEM Lund. The voting by other iGEM teams’ representatives was almost unanimous and in agreement with the judges’ opinions. It was clear that iGEM Lund has an almost never ending enthusiasm about their project and an unique spirit and attitude amongst the teams! But even though we did not win the prize our team still got a shout out from the judges for having a reasonable and interesting project. We also got a great feedback and suggestions from other teams that helped us a lot while progressing in the project. Thanks to NIC we got the chance to meet other teams that are close to us and it gave us a great base for the other collaborations we had during the competition. </DIV><DIV class="bla1" style="color: #F1654C"> Teams represented at NIC: DTU-Denmark, SDU Denmark, UCopenhagen, Aalto-Helsinki, Chalmers-Gothenburg, Linkoping_Sweden, Stockholm, Uppsala, Lund

Since we shared the same interest in synthetic biology it was an opportunity to learn from each other, and it lead to many great discussions. We had some activities together with them as well, such as a “swedish fika” with swedish games, candies and pastries. Other activities include a trip to a lake in the surrounding area of Uppsala and one night we had dinner together at one of the student nations in Uppsala. All of these activities gave us the chance to get to know them better and to introduce them to iGEM in general while they got the most out of their trip to Sweden. We also held a more formal presentation of our project for the students where they had the opportunity to ask us questions.
