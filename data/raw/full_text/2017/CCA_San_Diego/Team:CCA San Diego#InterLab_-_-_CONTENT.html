The objective of this year’s interlab was to use an identical protocol for eight different plasmids (6 test devices, a positive, and a negative control) in expressing GFP and measuring it in common units to compare results across the world and across a variety of plate readers. This year, a new bicistronic design element (J364100) was used in an attempt to improve the accuracy and reliability of results worldwide in conjunction with the three promoters that were tested last year: J23101, J23106, and J23117. The new BCD was measured against the B0034 single ribosome binding site with the same promoters and against both a positive and negative control in I20270 and R0040. These plasmids were transformed on the pSB1C3 vector in standard fashion and tested to produce the results below.
</H6><H3>Methodology</H3><H6>First we standardized our measurements in both LUDOX-HS40 and water by taking a set of measurements in a spectrophotometer and calculating a correction factor to convert our data into the standardized units that iGEM requested (OD<SUBSCRIPT>600</SUBSCRIPT>).

We also conducted 4 trials to generate 4 replicates on the final sampling plate. 
To measure the cell-based assays, we started by transforming 8 plates of E. coli with the 8 samples provided in Kit 7. After allowing the colonies to form on the plates, each plate had 2 colonies selected to be grown in 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.

The samples were once again incubated at 37°and 220 rpm.  At the 0, 2, 4 and 6 hour time points during the incubation, 500 µL of each sample from both colonies were taken and measured for fluorescence.</H6><TABLE width="35%" height="auto"><TBODY><TR><TD><H6>Figure 4: The overnight cultures show indications of varying fluorescence even before the formal testing period.</H6></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H6>For each time point, we had a 96 well plate that was organized according to the diagram provided by iGEM with each of our 8 devices over 4 replicates and an LB blank.  Finally, the data we gathered was corrected and converted into the standardized units that the interlab uses to compare data across all the participating labs.
</H6><H3>Results</H3><H6>Using water as a blank, the corrected absorbance of LUDOX is 0.0084. Correction factor was then calculated by dividing the corrected absorbance by a reference OD value of 0.0425. Hence, the correction factor of 5.059 FI represents the fluorescence intensity, and absorbance 600 represents the density of bacterial culture. Therefore, FI/Abs600 is used to assess the strength of the GFP expression.</H6><TABLE width="35%" height="auto"><TBODY><TR><TD><H6>Figure 5: Images taken from the plate reader at 0 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and the standard  fluorescein plate.</H6></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><CENTER><H3>Interlab Notebook</H3></CENTER><DIV class="brands"><TABLE width="100%" height="80px"><TBODY><TR><TD bgcolor="#000000" width="33%" height="45px"><CENTER><H6 style="color:#FFFFFF">email <I>igemcca@gmail.com</I></H6></CENTER></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="container"><H6 style="color:#FFFFFF"> Canyon Crest Academy iGEM 2017 CC;</H6></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
