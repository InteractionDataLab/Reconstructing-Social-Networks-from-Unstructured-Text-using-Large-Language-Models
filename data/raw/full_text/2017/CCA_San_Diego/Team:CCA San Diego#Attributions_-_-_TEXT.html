For the 2017 iGEM season we had 21 high school students in a collaborative team. We are composed of students with interests and talents from art to math, biochemistry to teaching, molecular biology to computer science. Everything we did was planned, produced, and executed by all of our team members: from laboratory studies to financial endeavors. This year we have really made an imPAHct on our community and we are excited to show you what we have accomplished!
