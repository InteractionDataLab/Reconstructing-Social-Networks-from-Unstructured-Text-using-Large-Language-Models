Gel
Materials
Agarose
1xTAE
Microwave
EtBr
Tray and comb
Methods
Measure 1 g of agarose
Mix agarose powder with 100 mL 1xTAE in a microwavable flask.
Microwave for 1-3 min until the agarose is completely dissolved
Let agarose solution cool down to about 50°C (about when you can comfortably keep your hand on the flask), about 5 mins.
Add ethidium bromide (EtBr) to a final concentration of approximately 0.2-0.5 μg/mL
Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place.
Place newly poured gel at 4°C for 10-15 mins OR let sit at room temperature for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solidified.
Gel Purification
Materials
Finished Gel
Microtube
DNA Purification Kit
Methods
Once you have run your gel, move it to an open UV box.
Remove it from any gel tray as plastic will block much of the UV and with a clean, sterile razor blade, slice the desired DNA fragment from the gel.
Place the gel in a labeled microfuge tube.
Using a scale, weigh the tube with the gel fragment. The weight of the gel is directly proportional to its liquid volume and this is used to determine how much of each buffer to add during the DNA isolation step.
Isolate the DNA from the gel using any gel purification kit. Follow kit instructions.
