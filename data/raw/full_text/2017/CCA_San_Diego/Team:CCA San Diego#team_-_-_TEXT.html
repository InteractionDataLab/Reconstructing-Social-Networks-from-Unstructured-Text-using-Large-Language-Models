Canyon Crest Academy's iGEM team is composed of 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students who enjoy working in STEM. The team is broken up into 4 main sections: lab, outreach, organization, and finance. The lab team is composed of students who go to a laboratory to work on the project. Outreach is made up of students who want to help the team connect with the science community by hosting various events. Students on the organization team design and create both the CCA iGEM website and poster. The finance team, well, manages the money.
