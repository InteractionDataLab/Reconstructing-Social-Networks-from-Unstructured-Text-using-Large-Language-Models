However, later on Piotr Janas, redirected the idea from examining both MRSA and UTIs, to just UTIs. This was to eliminate any false positives from commensals appearing in our sample. Urine is considered sterile, therefore culture urine and focus on UTIs.

The team was guided by the supervisor Dimitrios Michailidis. During the development of the project, they all helped to arrange and attend meetings with relevant academics at the university of Sheffield, clinicians from abroad and microbiologists to ensure that the biology behind the idea was sound. They then went on to produce some antibiotic resistant bacterial strains by transformation of iGEM biobricks. These were initially used to produce bacterial growth curves, and then used for the 96 well plate reader experiments, which were then analysed.
We have used Kanamycin, Chloramphenicol, Carbenicillin and wild type (control)  as strains and we tested whether <I>E. coli</I> is resistant or sensitive to the particular antibiotics. Then using the well plate reader we obtained our results and analysed them.

Our aim was to construct a cheap device which was relatively easy to build and is able provide automated readings of a bacterial sample. During the development of this device meetings were arranged with academic supervisors to seek advice about the circuit construction and software implementation of the device. Once prototyping of the device had begun a lot of time was spent troubleshooting and making adjustments to the device, including additions such as the external casing was made. Software implementation was also being developed along the device with the aim of constructing a user-friendly interface for quick data interpretation.

In the respect of investigating the bacterial growth response, we wanted to know what sort of time we would be expecting to wait for different starting inoculums of bacteria. Some meeting with advisor were arranged to discuss which would be the simplest and most effective way to answer this question. Some simple in lab experiments began, and a simple linear model was constructed to estimate the time it would take growth to be noticed depending on the initial inoculum.
