UK iGEM meetup
In August, we were invited to attend the UK iGEM meetup organized by the iGEM teams from the University of Westminster, University of Warwick and University College London.  Almost the whole team attended this event which spanned over two days. The first day involved attending a series of lectures and a team poster presentation followed by debates and presentations by iGEM teams at the Shard on the second day.
This was a great opportunity for our team to interact with other teams and to gain feedback on our device.
University of Nottingham
One of our team members, Thea helped the Nottingham iGEM team in developing their game - NottPortal. Thea helped with providing he voice for one of the characters in the game.
We helped the Nottingham team in showing proof of application of their device. The Nottingham team sent us some freeze dried bacteria which we revived and then checked if the bacteria can actually be retrieved, stay alive and grow.
University of Peshawar
The Peshawar team helped with our human practices by speaking to clinicians in Pakistan.These clinicians informed us the medicinal practice and about antibiotic usage in Pakistan where we learnt that patients rely on self prescription and the availability of even fourth generation antibiotics over the counter encourages this practice. The Peshawar team also provided us with data of multi-drug resistant strains in Pakistan and the treatments regimens that are currently used.
