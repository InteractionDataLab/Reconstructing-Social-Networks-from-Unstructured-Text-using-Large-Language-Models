She also suggested tailoring our device to allow measurements to be taken at different times from as short as 15 minutes to longer periods. Following her advice, we will be modifying our coding to allow for different measurements to be taken.</P><P>Ryan Kinsella from PreventX Diagnostics raised the concern about ensuring patient confidentiality. We have addressed this issue by developing our own encryption software based on discrete cellular automaton models to ensure that data can only be accessed by clinicians and lab technicians. </P><P>We also spoke to consultant microbiologists from Poland and Cyprus who informed us about a similar device to ours which is currently being used in diagnostic labs - Vitek2. Our team was inspired by Vitek2, to develop different types of well-plates which would contain antibiotics in the form of powder which can be used to select the most appropriate antibiotic treatment for patients.</P><P>The team also met Professor Stephan Matcher, from the University of Sheffield who specializes in the development and application of biophotonic tools to obtain information about the structure and function of tissue in the body. Professor Stephan Matcher proposed the use of deeper wells for the well plates for our device in order to increase the sensitivity of our device. We therefore ordered deeper well plates and are currently performing experiments to investigate the benefits they offer for our device in terms of improving sensitivity.</P><P><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/Human_Practices">https://2017.igem.org/Team:Sheffield/Human_Practices</A></P><H2>Demonstrate your work</H2><P>For more information, please visit:
