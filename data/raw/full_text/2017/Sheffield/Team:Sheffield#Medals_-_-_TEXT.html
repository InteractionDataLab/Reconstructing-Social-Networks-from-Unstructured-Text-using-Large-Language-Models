Integrated Human Practices
Dr. Melinda Stapleton, the senior lab technician at the University of Sheffield’s undergraduate teaching labs thought that it would be useful if our device could change the filters in order to change the wavelengths to suit different experiments. She also suggested tailoring our device to allow measurements to be taken at different times from as short as 15 minutes to longer periods. Following her advice, we will be modifying our coding to allow for different measurements to be taken.
Ryan Kinsella from PreventX Diagnostics raised the concern about ensuring patient confidentiality. We have addressed this issue by developing our own encryption software based on discrete cellular automaton models to ensure that data can only be accessed by clinicians and lab technicians.
We also spoke to consultant microbiologists from Poland and Cyprus who informed us about a similar device to ours which is currently being used in diagnostic labs - Vitek2. Our team was inspired by Vitek2, to develop different types of well-plates which would contain antibiotics in the form of powder which can be used to select the most appropriate antibiotic treatment for patients.
The team also met Professor Stephan Matcher, from the University of Sheffield who specializes in the development and application of biophotonic tools to obtain information about the structure and function of tissue in the body. Professor Stephan Matcher proposed the use of deeper wells for the well plates for our device in order to increase the sensitivity of our device. We therefore ordered deeper well plates and are currently performing experiments to investigate the benefits they offer for our device in terms of improving sensitivity.

Validated Part / Validated Contribution
We performed growth curve experiments using both a standard spectrophotometer and a well-plate reader and the results from these experiments were similar, confirming that our device has the potential to run in a similar manner to the well-plate reader.
Collaborations
One of our team members, Thea provided her voice for the role of automated voice in team Nottingham’s game - NottPortal.
We will also be checking team Nottingham’s freeze dried bacteria to check for their growth.
Team Peshawar helped in us in the area of Human Practices by speaking to clinicians in Pakistan about the issue of antimicrobial resistance and about how a device such as ours can benefit them.
We supported the iGEM teams of Westminster, Warwick and University College London by attending the UK iGEM meetup

Human Practices
The team started off with the idea to build a cheap, DIY well-plate reader that could be used in a range of different applications - in medicine, research and academics. Whilst exploring the role this device would play in each of these fields, meetings with healthcare professionals and GPs in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Northern General, Royal Liverpool Hospital as well as international diagnostic labs in Cyprus, Poland and Sri Lanka the team discovered that the most pressing problem our device could address was AMR.
The team also met with a lab technician in the undergraduate teaching labs at the University of Sheffield who informed us about the different experiments that our device could be used in and also gave us some feedback on areas of improvement.
We met with Dr. Lynda Partridge, senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield, who provided us with guidelines on how to ensure that our research was inline with the data protection act (1998) and common law duty of confidence.
