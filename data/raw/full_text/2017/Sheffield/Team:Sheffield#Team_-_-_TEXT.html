Students
Uddhav
Agarwal
Computer Science
Uddhav, well Uddhav is a special man, he came here all the way from India. I admire his patience with everyone in this team, especially since he is our wiki guy and has to put up with everyone and put all the ideas in order. Partying is not his thing at all (only sarcasm here) or wearing shorts when its freezing cold. When it comes to his knowledge on computers, we are all amazed but what we are really amazed with is his rich head of hair.
Emily
Ingham
Bioengineering
Emily is our team’s transport provider. She’s always offering us rides whether it’s for important human practices meetings or just for our casual destressing times at the pub. She gives a death stare if we ever try to poke her and she’s always amused by how Piotr bullies Harindi.
Thea
Chrysostomou
Biomedical Sciences
To start with, yes; Cyprus is not a part of Greece. Want to argue about that? I really don’t recommend you do that with Thea. Well, she is a third year Biomedical Sciences student, she is quite cute. And oh boy let me tell you one thing, she loves anatomy. Cutting Extensor Digitorum Longus is her thing. After finishing her undergraduate studies she will start medical degree somewhere with more sun(sorry Sheffield). Thea has some real fire, she is always ready to dance it out with of course latin music. Honestly though, she has quite a big heart, If she could, she would like to help anyone in need!
Lucy
Barnett
Bioengineering
Hello, my name is Lucy as you can probably see and I’m from Brighton, but decided to start a bioengineering course at The University of Sheffield. Mostly because we don’t have any good universities in Brighton. We do, however, have an excellent aquarium, which I enjoy visiting very, very much. Because I am running out of the word limit, I feel like I should express my love and passion to iGEM. Team is great, but Piotr Janas is the pillar that holds us together.
Piotr
Janas
Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
Piotr is a very nice guy, full of energy but he currently betrayed us and moved to Edinburgh for Masters in the department of Infectious diseases. He is passionate about some quality wine and jazz chilled nights. But what he really enjoys is some long hiking trips in the middle of nowhere. He knows everything and always dresses smart even in pyjamas. He is very ambitious and am looking forward to sit next to him when he will get his Nobel Prize.
Harindi
Jayakody
Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
Harindi’s a wonderful microbiologist who genuinely enjoys human practices research (except where Piotr’s involved). She enjoys socialising with the group and if you ask her really nicely, she’ll bring you some of her fantastic cooking (which she’d weirdly rather not eat herself). She’s from Sri Lanka and is one of the most patient people we know (except when Piotr leads her to put coffee in her water bottle).
Caleb
Parikh
Automatic Control Systems Engineering
Hello there future friends! My name is Caleb and I spend most of my time studying Automated Control Systems Engineering. ACSE students can be quite timid sometimes, but I am trying to improve my social skills, so if you see me at the Jamboree, don’t be afraid to give me a big ol’ hug and help me get over my fear of human contact. If I’m not at library, I am probably out with my iGEM friends or shooting some pictures with my very expensive camera, or maybe even playing some jams on my guitar.
Ruby
Kell
Molecular Biology and Biotechnology
Ruby is a talented microbiologist whose work at IGEM included everything from planning and executing wet lab experiments to conducting market research and branding for our device. She was particularly involved in organising our outreach event which saw aspiring scientists from high schools across Sheffield learning about synthetic biology and even taking part in a mini jamboree-style event!
