Vice Captain
iGEM is a game, but you have to do more than a game. We fight for it and enjoy it. I love OUC, and the experience would never get out of my mind.I hope everyone can stick to his favorite cause,everything will be ok!
Zhongshi Wang
Vice Captain
Hello, I'm Neil. I'm the vice captain of the team. I am an undergraduate of College of Marines Life Science.In the experiment, I command in the mSA-Biotin system and I also develop the theory of our basic system. Except Biology, I also like movies and books.
Shuo Tian
Modeling
I'm an undergraduate from Institute of Environmental Science and Engineering who majors in Environmental Engeering. In life, I love painting and piano. In iGEM, I do mathematical modeling to help the project implementation and looking for something cool in synthetic biology.
Ying Chen
Lab Administrator
I am an undergraduate of College of Marines Life Science.Together with the other laboratory administrator, I design the general experimental plans, take responsibility for the project to promote the experiments and purchase experimental materials. If you ask me why to choose iGEM? I will say that I yearn for an extraordinary college life.
Lei Zhu
Wet-dry Communicator
I am a student of Marine Life College, Ecology. In igem, responsible for RNA content determination, interlab and DNA sequence design work. Reading, running, ancient and rational are things that I like. After exploring the life, the universe really is the ultimate problem of human ah!
Qianxia Zhang
Financial Supervisor
Hi!My name is Qianxia Zhang. I join this team as a Finance Supervisor and also as a wet lab member. I took part in this competition because synthetic biology is a multidisciplinary subject which interested me. I believe that through this competition, I can get more research experience and gain an unforgettable experience.
Shuheng Yan
Designer
I'm a student of Aquaculture College. I am responsible for designing posters, brochures, as well as programming wiki. I also do some experiments in our lab. So it seems like I have done many kinds of stuff in our team:). During preparing competition, I have met a lot of interesting people, which is exactly what I want for taking part in iGEM.
Shunan Hu
Publicist
Hello, my name is HU SHUNAN. I am mainly responsible for the platform to push our daily, the project process and the training of the next member. I also participated in the wet experiment.One of my favorite thing is reading which can waste you life and let you observe great man. Sometimes I feel myself have two personalities. Either  irritable or very happy.
Jiale Qu
Lab Administrator
I am the other laboratory administrator. My major is bioscience. As a wet group member, I participate in different kinds of experiment except designing experimental plans. Through this experience, I believe iGEM will bring lots of precious memoryies to me.
Xizhong Ding
Major Member In Wet Group
I’m Xizhong Ding, an undergraduate from OUC. My major is pharmacy, but I fell in love with synthetic biology last summer. I concentrate on experiments and primer design. The reason why I join iGEM is curiosity. It’s really exciting to construct an organism with the performance we want. I love synthetic biology and will explore more about it in the future.
Yunhao Fan
Major Member In Wet Group
My name is Yunhao Fan. This summer I worked in the lab and enjoyed myself. iGEM brought me an unforgettable memory.
