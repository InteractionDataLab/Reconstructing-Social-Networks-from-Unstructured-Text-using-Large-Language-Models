Our team members designed and constructed all our circuits and experiments with our own idea, but we would have go nowhere without the help from many other people from our school, other institutions and the society. We sincerely appreciate all the help!
Here is the division and cooperation of our team as well as our special thanks and attribution to all who helped:
Wet lab
For the basic group, Jiale Qu and Yuqing Chen proceed the fermentation, detected the growth rate of recombinant strain with microplate reader. Jiale Qu examined the ethanol level with SBA and Yuqing Chen run HPLC for the consumption of sugar. Qianxia Zhang take charge of the design and construction of resveratrol plasmid along with Shunan Hu taking charge of the detection of resveratrol production.
For the adhesion group, Ying Chen is responsible for protein detection of E. coli ice nucleation protein’s display on cell surface, which is mainly about extracting membrane protein, doing SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. Yunhao Fan is responsible for the measurement of the growth rate of E. coli and yeast, providing experimental parameters for model. Zhongshi Wang is responsible for co-culture experiments on E. coli and yeast, followed by optimization of co-culture culture conditions and qualitative and quantitative verification of both successful link and link effect.
For the mini group, Xizhong Ding and Jiale Qu constructed the four complete circuit with Gibson Assemble. They also measured the fluorescence of yECitrine. Lei Zhu and Rong Mu extracted the RNA of the engineered yeasts and measured the transcriptional strength by RT-PCR.
Dry lab
Shuheng Yan is our web designer and art designer who established the structure of our wiki, poster, team uniform and many other designing works.
Shuo Tian is in charge of all our modeling part who give instructions to the web lab member with model.
In addition, Lei Zhu act as a coordinator between wet lab and dry lab. Rong Mu pushed the proceeding of human practice and communication with other teams. Xizhong Ding and Yuqing Chen designed all the primers used in PCR and part standardization.
Acknowledgement for support
General support
Every member in 2016 OUC-China iGEM gave us practical suggestions.
Yang Liu, the Captain of OUC-China 2011 and Li Kang, the Captain of OUC-China 2012 helped improve the synthetic conception of our project. Haoqian Zhang, the CTO of Bluepha and the former captain of the Peking iGEM, help modified the fermentation way in the basic part. Yihao Zhang, former captain of the Peking iGEM help with the plasmid construction part of Adhesion group.
Our PI Prof. Chenguang Liu, Zhenghong Sui, and Shian Wang offered us constructive advice over our project and gave us long term technical consulting support through the whole procedure.
Prof. Xianghong Wang kindly offered us experimental lab and restroom.
Prof. Xiaoming Bao from Shandong University and Prof.Lihai Fan from Beijing University of Chemical Technology kindly offered us important suggestions on the initial stage of our project.
Trevor Ho, the Captain of HKUST 2011 gave us advice on model.
Equipment and technical support
Prof. Weizhi Liu, from College of Marine Life, Ocean University of China, provided us ELIASA (BioTek Synergy H1) by which we could use to measure optical density and fluorescence intensity of our sample.
Prof. Xiaonan Zang, from College of Marine Life, Ocean University of China, provided us instrument (Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000C) to measure the concentration of nucleic acid.
Prof. Guangli Yu and Hao Jiang, from School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, provided us HPLC with related consumable and instruments to detect the contents of xylose and cellobiose in our sample as well as the plate reader for fluorescence measurement part for Interlab.
Prof. Haijin Mu, College of Food Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, provided us SBA biosensor (SBA-40C) to get data of contents of ethanol and glucose.
Prof. Chenguang Liu, Zhenghong Sui provided us with necessary device in protein extraction, SDS-PAGE& western blot.
Prof. Zhigang Wang provided us with instrument on the detection of RNA contents (RT-PCR).
Prof. Jinshan Tan provided us with instrument and technical help on TEM.
Prof. Jiankai Wei provided us help with CLSM observation.
Prof. Mingzhuang Zhu provided us help with FACS observation.
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE EFFORT AND HELP IN THE PAST YEAR !
