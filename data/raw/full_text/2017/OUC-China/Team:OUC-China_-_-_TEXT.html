A Bottle of Algae "Wine"
Producing ethanol from algae
Qingdao is a beautiful tourist city.
However, every summer a monster--Enteromorpha--will come to the seaside,
scaring away all tourists.
And the beautiful sea becomes empty and lonely.
After hearing the event, S.cerevisiae and E.colidecide to come and defeat Enteromorpha.
E.coli uses cellulase and hemicellulase as his sword to smash Enteromorpha.
The fragment of Enteromorpha becomes cellodextrin and xylose.
At the same time, S.cerevisiae collects the fragment and make it into glucose and then, ethanol.
Finally, mixing with resveratrol, S.cerevisiae transforms the monster into Enteromorpha wine.
Enteromorpha disappeared!
Now every summer, people enjoy themselves on the beautiful beach in Qingdao!

A Bottle Of Algae "Wine"
Producing ethanol from algae
This year OUC-iGEM focuses on the efficient use of cellulose. We are concerned about the utilization of Enteromorpha as a hot local issue. Every year a large quantity of Enteromorpha are salvaged ashore. The utilization, however, remainds still in the initial stage . Compared to the traditional strategy of using terrestrial plant cellulose, the ingredient of lignin in large seaweed is rather low, which can lead to a better degradation.So it will be a great idea to produce new energy from Enteromorpha.
Our project can be devided into 3 parts:
Adhesion platform
E. coli and yeast is to adhere to each other and form a multi-cell unit, expanding the biological function of engineered cells.
Fermentation
We aim to make use of cellobiose and xylose produced from algae residue and turn them into ethanol---our Enteromorpha wine! Resveratrol is added to our wine to make it better for health.
Mini-GRE
We synthesize mini promoters in yeast, which have very concise sequences. In this way, we look forward to making our own contribution to the standardization of yeast!
