Collabrations
In order to share our ideas and experience, we collaborate with nine iGEM teams in experiment, Human Practice, modeling and software test this year, making each other benefit from the collaboration.
SDU-China 2017
We help SDU-China model the effect of EGF on hTERT promoter (activation) and YM155 on surviving promoter (inhibition) successfully using Hill equation, fit their experimental data, calculate the statistical characteristics and determine the concentrations of inducer and inhibitors that lead to half-expression level.
What’s more, this year is the first year that SDU-China participate this competition so that they came to our college to communicate experimental ideas and modeling with us. When we held the Life Science and Technology Camp, we worked together to prepare material and publicize the camp and they also held a lecture to introduce the application of synthetic biology in the field of medicine.

Tianjin 2017
We help Tianjin expand the error-prone PCR library. Easy-to-error PCR library development. We were supposed to amplify theirs existing error-prone PCR library by conducting error-prone PCR for the CUP1 promoter.
Protocols:
1. Specific steps:
2. Error-prone PCR
3. Digestion
4. Purification / Adsorption
5. Connect
6. E.coli transformation
Easy-to-error PCR protocol (100μl):
5X buffer（140mM MgCl2, 250mM KCl, 50mM Tris, and 0.1%(wt/vol) gelatin）20μl
Template (iGEM-Tianjin provided) 4μl
Primers (iGEM-Tianjin provided) 4μl*2
10X dNTP (2mM dGTP, 2mM dATP, 10mM dCTP, and 10 mM TTP) 10μl
Taq polymerase 2μl
5mM MnCl2 10μl
ddH2O 46μl
94℃ 3min
94℃ 30s
53℃ 30s
72℃ 30s
72℃ 1min
Recycle for 35 times
The PCR products were obtained and digested with BamHI and XbaI, and ligated with vector pRS416.
Tianjin assists us with the test of the mini combination in order to verify that the MINI-GRE can work successfully in different yeast strains and under various laboratories conditions.
Accidentally, the chassis in the project of Tianjin are yeasts but with a synthetic genome, so that they also tested our mini combination in their special yeast called SynX. Consequently, the efficiency of our MINI-GRE is validated.

HFUT-China 2017
We test the software called BioDesigner Dolphin, which was developed by HFUT-China this year.
This software can be utilized to search for teams under certain or combined track and biobrick information, which is very useful.
There are some recommendation teams will appear when you search with key words or look over specific teams, which is based on how much teams are related according to their contents and themes.

Peking 2017
Team Peking provided us with genetic element of mSA that have been utilized in our heterogeneous adhesion platform.
In August, we went to Beijing to communicate with Peking members. We not only acquired many valuable suggestions for our project design but also got some instruction in scientific data processing.

Nanjing-China 2017
We helped Nanjing-China validate the function of their formaldehyde whole-cell sensor. We transformed their plasmids to E. coli BL-21 and induced the becteria with 1400uM formaldehyde( or without formaldehyde for control).  After 13h’s  incubation, the difference was revealed in the picture. After pelleting the cells, we could see clearly that the medium in the experimental group turned red, while the negative control do not, indicating that their plasmids function well under our experimental conditions.
Nanjing-China helped us test the performance of mini combination under different experimental conditions such as in different yeast strains or in different laboratories. In this way we can better verify the application prospect of mini combinations.

CSMU X NCHU Taiwan 2017
We help CSMU ＆ NCHU 2017 build the kinetic model of aflatoxin degradation using Michaelis-Menten equations. We simulate it using ODE equations to estimate the kinetic parameters from experimental data given by them, and do the stochastic simulations to explore the robustness of the degradation process.
The Human Practice section helps us gather information about the algae outbreak caused by water pollution. They shared with us their information about water eutrophication in Taiwan and documented several governmental reports, online database and academic papers in National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan.

NWU-China 2017
This year, team members of NWU-China came to our school for communication. We talked about synthetic biology, team running, iGEM competition, and many other things with shared concerns.
Moreover, we organized a summer camp for primary and secondary school students to spread our understandings of synthetic biology, during which NWU-China and other universities also played important roles by helping with the propagandization and material preparing.

NAU-China 2017
NAU-China provided us with plasmid pFA6a-GFP-kan-MX6, which is used in the detection of our adhesion platform between heterologous cells. They lent us a hand at a critical moment.

Paris Bettencourt 2017
They completed our survey-Investigation on Aquatic organisms outbreak caused by water entrophication- and give us valuable feedback. They investigate the trends of eutrophication in the Loire River (France) and gathered related information for us.
