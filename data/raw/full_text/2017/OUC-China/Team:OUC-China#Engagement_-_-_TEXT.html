Comic book of synthetic biology
This year we use a novel method to teach people synthetic biology and spread scientific thinking so that we spent half a year designing a comic book of Synthetic Biology, which illustrate it in a vivid way in order to propagandize to the public and show our love for the Synthetic Biology.
In addition, we believed that letting more people such as teens in school know about Synthetic Biology in the form of a story, which exhibits the complex biology model and principle with funny comics, will make public more interested in Biology.
Maybe other team could work with such form too.

Life science and technology camp
We cooperated with other colleges to organize a summer camp, spreading our ideas to freshmen and sophomores.
Our summer camp, a week of life science experience, is mainly for the freshman from four colleges who will communicate with each other in some interesting activities including classifying marine organisms in the intertidal zone of the sea, salvaging Enteromorpha and other algae, extracting marine luminous bacteria.
They also did several scientific researches with independent design by themselves. The main purpose of the summer camp is to inspire college students to develop their own ability to find their own interests and to improve their learning methods, moreover, to know the spirit of independent thinking.
This year is the first year for SDU-China to participate in iGEM, they came to the summer camp to communicate with us, and we also get some interdispline knowledge from them.
In the future, we look forward to attracting more colleges and their students to join in,providing them more resources and experience.
Lectures on popular science among primary and middle school students
Furthermore, in order to introduce iGEM and Synthetic Biology, we held a series of lectures in local colleges and middle schools, bringing related knowledge to the middle school students, consisting of development of biotechnology and synthetic biology in the fields of medicine, agriculture and environment protection.
We exhibit iGEM competitions, synthetic biology, and our projects at the university's Science and Technology exhibition to make students of different majors know about synthetic biology. Luckily, we also introduced our team and iGEM to our national Vice Premier Liu Yandong and she gave us great encouragement and affirmation.
Social media
We spread iGEM spirits and the development of synthetic biology in China through social media.
