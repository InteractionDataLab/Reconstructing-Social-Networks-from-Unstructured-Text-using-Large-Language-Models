Biosafety
Biosafety investigation and considerations for our project
For further investigation, we went to the Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy Research, CAs. We consulted professors who worked for years on bioenergy development and microbial fermentation. The safety problems involved in ethanol production by microbial fermentation of cellulose were discussed. We realized that there were many kinds of microorganisms that can degrade cellulose in nature, and the expression of fungal cellulase in engineered yeast is even more common. Moreover, as the expression of exogenous genes in S.cerevisiae is limited, there is no need to worry about the overwhelm consequences in our experiments. In the long run, the construction of yeast that can utilize cellulose or hemicellulose can effectively convert the rich algae waste into a renewable carbon source for use in the bioenergy industry in the future.
To fully investigate the impact of Enteromorpha outbreak in the marine environment, we went to the first Marine Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We got to know that the coastal Enteromorpha is mainly from the Shoal of northern Jiangsu, where a large number of floating Enteromorpha drift to the Yellow Sea coast due to aquaculture Waters. The green tide distributes about 20,000 square kilometers, covering an area of about 187 square kilometers. A large number of Enteromorpha hoard along the seaside , which is very easy to become rotten, ang thus do harm to marine environment and marine life.
Our project goal is to make use of Enteromorpha. In the long run, our project is of great significance in solving environmental problems and protecting marine life. In the project design and implementation process, we strictly abode the safety regulations of the iGEM Committee, To see more details please refer to our safety page.
Safety project design
Being responsible for our earth and ourselves is our attitude towards every experiment. In our project, all the parts we have utilized are selected from Risk Group 1, none of which are with a Red Flag. What’s more, nonpathogenic bacteria, E.coli K12 is employed as the main host. Up to now, although we have already made S. cerevisiae express xylase and cellobiase and also produce ethanol, we still want to enrich the nutritional value of ethanol. So we decided to make S. cerevisiae produce resveratrol, a compound with many medical value. In addition, for the innovation part we also try to mold avidin biotin and chain link E.coli KO11 and yeast, and then co-culture to test whether it can increase the alcohol yield. The co-culture these two strains is harmless for their growth and relatively safe for industrialized applications. In order not to destroy environment, all the experimental organisms were sterilized before being abandoned.
Safe lab work
We work at a neat lab named “Lab for Micro-innovation and Enterprise”, which is a BSL-2 laboratory. Before working in the lab, we are supposed to be trained by the skillful hands, not only for the general lab safety rules, but also for the standard experimental operation avoiding unnecessary damage. No experiment carries no risk to the experimenters, hence we are properly equipped with facilities, such as latex gloves, nitrile gloves, goggles, lab coats to protect us from biotic and abiotic hazards. For us, lab safety is a hot topic and we have come up with a practical lab safety manual which normalizes our lovely lab.
A comic book for biosafety
In the form of a comic book, we would like to share our understanding of biosafety and synthetic biology with more people. It is specifically designed for first learners of synthetic biology or children. Because to our understanding, biosafety stands above most of the other aspects in research. For this job, we carried out surveys among teachers and children, and spent over 6 month drawing and editing, hoping to spread the concept of biosafety to the society.

Establish the link between project and society
Through the work of human practice, we did plenty of research about Enteromorpha's current condition, application, and related study. The results can feedback to our lab and modify our project designs.
We have a full investigation of the background of the project: the cause of the Enteromorpha outbreak, the current situation of Enteromorpha outbreak, the application and utilization, the monitoring and forcasting, as well as local people's understanding of Enteromorpha's outbreak. To learn more about its advanced study, we also went to the First Institute of Oceanography, IOCAS, Qingdao Seawin Biotech Group and other places like that to dig deeper of Enteromorpha. There in IOCAS, we acquired knowledge of the influencing factor and reason for Enteromorpha outbreak. In the Qingdao Winsea Group, we volunteered in the processing workshop of the Enteromorpha and learn about the physical pretreatment necessary for our Enteromorpha residue utilization.
