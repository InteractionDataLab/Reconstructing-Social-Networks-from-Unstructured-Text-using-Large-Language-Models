    	We first powdered the algae, removed the lignin and then treated remains with the enzyme solution to produce cellobiose and xylose. 
In order to engineered the yeast for utilizing cellobiose and xylose as carbon resources, we cloned relative genes to a shuttle plasmid in <I>E. coli</I> cell, then transformed it to yeast. We prepared SC medium  containing xylose and cellobiose as the only carbon resources, so that we can verify that we have already cultivated the strain which can grow with merely cellobiose and xylose as their carbon sources. If our novel strains grow significantly better than the negative control (which does not have the gene <I>GH-1, CDT-1</I>, or <I>XYL1, XYL2</I>) we can prove that our ideas are feasible and the genetic circuit works well. 
At the same time, we used HPLC to detect the concentration changing of cellobiose and xylose, and got more data to support our idea that the engineered yeast can utilize cellobiose and xylose as carbon sources. If the concentration of xylose/cellobiose decrease with time. SBA biosensor can detect the reaction process of substrate by immobilized enzyme as electrochemical signal, which supports us to describe a curve reflecting the ethanol generation under culture condition. Here, we prove that two engineered yeast strains can utilize cellobiose and xylose to produce ethanol directly.

    			We transformed the pYC230nto <I>S.  cerevisiae</I> EBY100 and got the xylose-utilizing strain successfully. We measured the growth rate of both our engineered strain and the negative control. If there is an obvious superiority of our new strain in xylose utilization, we can prove that the circuit works as our design. As a result, the curve well demonstrates that the strain with xylose-utilizing circuit has a higher OD600 than the negative control strain during the entire cultivation period. The culture of engineered yeast (EBY100 with XDH-XR) reaches stationary phases after 40 hours cultivation with an OD600 of around 2.35. While the control strain(EBY100) has an almost horizontal OD curve.

    			When characterizing the growth rate of recombinant cells utilizing cellubiose with OD600, we found a platform stage in the middle of the curve suggesting probably a secondary growth. We figure out a hypothesis that the accumulation of the glucose when making use of cellubiose might be the reason underlying this phenomenon because a substitution process of the carbon sources can exactly lead to such a plateau in the growth curve. [1]Therefore, we detect the glucose content of the medium after that to validate our assumption.

   	        	The result (left) shows that glucose content in the medium reaches a peak at about 40 hours and then decrease rapidly. At around 70 hours, the content reaches the minimum and stay steady ever since. Considering the ethanol content (right) that also present a largest amount at around 80 hours, we believe that the glucose in yeast may be transformed gradually into acetic acid and ethanol participated in further metabolic procedure with acetic acid called Glucose Glycolysis, thus was turned into lipid.

    		And for a more visualized display, we use plate streaking to show the growth condition of our two recombinative strains and negative strains in different carbon source. We make three plates with either xylose, cellobiose or xylose plus cellobiose as sole or compound carbon source, respectively and monitor the growth of each strain in three different plate after cultivating for 32 hours at 30℃. As a result,yesat with pYC230-XYL1-XYL2 grows faster than the rest of two strains in 2% xylose as sole carbon plate, and cellobiose strain with pYC230-CDT-GH1 has a much faster growth rate than that of the other two strains in 2% cellobiose as sole carbon plate. These two recombinant strains also show a better growing condition than WT EBY100 with a medium of 2% xylose and 2% cellobiose as compound carbon source. This phenomenon indicates that we can actually utilize xylose and cellobiose from algae residue and produce ethanol with our engineered yeasts!
