Bronze
Our team has satisfied the following departments:
Registered for iGEM, had a great summer, and attended the Giant Jamboree.
Meet all deliverables on the Requirements page.
Create a page on your team wiki with clear attribution of each aspect of your project. This page must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Improve the characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on that part's Main Page in the Registry. The part that you are characterizing must NOT be from a 2017 part number range.
- We improved the characterization of a previous part: BBa_K1900002 (E. coli tolC)
Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, our team has also satisfied these following departments:
Experimentally validated these new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected. We designed BBa_k2452002 as our new BioBrick part. We used Western blots to demonstrate that the phage tail protein is produced, and has a his-tag attached.
Convince the judges that you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way. We collaborated with various teams involving surveys and advice for the problems that they came across on their projects.
iGEM projects involved important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.
- Examined the ethical ramifications inherent to water management work and researched concerns relating to the sustainability of our project.
- Undertook various Community Outreach projects based on our current work.
- Surveyed members of the public and prepared an informational pamphlet on water safety and testing.
- Interviewed various community leaders and experts to better understand the scope and application of our project.
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, our team also achieved these following goals:
Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.
- Integrated the information gleaned from interviews and community interaction into making our project more sustainable, ecologically friendly, and ethically sound.
- Altered the scope, marketing, and application of our project based on advice received in our interviews of experts in the fields of water management and public health.
Convince the judges that your project works. We have demonstrated great potential for our device, as well as proved its functionality. Our enzyme conjugated phage tail tip binds and recognizes E. coli. which allows for rapid deteciton.
