Human Practices
While we may be a small team, we believe even the efforts of a few people can have a massive impact on the world. Our team approaches our Human Practices work in four substantial ways:
Understanding the scope, impacts, and ethics of our work.
Understanding the concerns of and educating the public on genetic modification and our project.
Improving our project by communicating with and receiving advice from various community groups.
Improving our project by collaborating with various iGEM teams.
