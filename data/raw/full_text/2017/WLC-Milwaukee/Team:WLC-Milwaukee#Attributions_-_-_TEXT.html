Our Wonderful Professors
James Henkel, Ph.D.
Dr. Henkel's assistance in beginning the purification process was absolutely essential. He holds invaluable knowledge and expertise in areas such as microbiology, protein purification, and biochemistry. We wouldn't have made it far without him!
John N. Werner, Ph.D.
Dr. Werner has helped us through the good, bad, and ugly of lab life. He has a vast knowledge of bacteriophages as well as many complicated laboratory techniques. We cannot thank him enough for the time and effort he puts into our project.
Wisconsin Lutheran College
We have to give a huge thank you to Wisconsin Lutheran College for all of the financial support as well as encouragement, and providing a place for a Christ-centered education! A special thank you to the Biology department for their resources, lab space, and mentorship.
