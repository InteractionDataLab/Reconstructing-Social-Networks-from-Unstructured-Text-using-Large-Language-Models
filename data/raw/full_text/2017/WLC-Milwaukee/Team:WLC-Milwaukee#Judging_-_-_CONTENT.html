</P></DIV><DIV class="silver"><H2> Silver </H2><P>In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, our team has also satisfied these following departments:</P><P>	Experimentally validated these new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected. We designed BBa_k2452002 as our new BioBrick part. We used Western blots to demonstrate that the phage tail protein is produced, and has a his-tag attached.</P><P>	Convince the judges that you have helped any registered iGEM team from high school, a different track, another university, or another institution in a significant way. We collaborated with various teams involving surveys and advice for the problems that they came across on their projects.</P><P>	iGEM projects involved important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, and intellectual property rights. Demonstrate how your team has identified, investigated and addressed one or more of these issues in the context of your project.</P><P>- Examined the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/HP/Silver">ethical</A> ramifications inherent to water management work and researched concerns relating to the sustainability of our project. </P><P>- Undertook various <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/Engagement">Community Outreach</A> projects based on our current work. </P><P>- Surveyed members of the public and prepared an <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/Engagement">informational pamphlet</A> on water safety and testing. </P><P>- Interviewed various community <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/HP/Gold_Integrated">leaders and experts</A> to better understand the scope and application of our project. </P></DIV><DIV class="gold"><H2> Gold </H2><P> In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, our team also achieved these following goals:</P><P>	Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues into the design and/or execution of your project.</P><P>- Integrated the information gleaned from interviews and community interaction into making our project more sustainable, ecologically friendly, and <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/HP/Silver">ethically sound.</A></P><P>- Altered the scope, marketing, and application of our project based on advice received in our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:WLC-Milwaukee/HP/Gold_Integrated">interviews of experts</A> in the fields of water management and public health. </P><P>	Convince the judges that your project works.
