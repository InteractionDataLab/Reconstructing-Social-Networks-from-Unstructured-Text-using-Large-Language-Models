Parts Submitted
BBa_K2216000
We submitted the part BBa_K2216000. It is a composite part Promoter J23101 + RBS B0034 + Aldehyde dehydrogenase A(aldA) + Double Terminator B0015. Check the link in the table below.

Other Parts Documented on the Registry but not shipped by Deadline:
BBa_K2216001
BBa_K2216001 is a basic part consisted of Aldehyde dehydrogenase A(aldA) from Escherichia coli KO11FL. We planned to make the basic part by PCR. Primers are designed and synthesized. However, we are unable to complete and submit the standard parts by deadline. Still, we are very happy to provide the information of our gene on the registry page for improvement and use by future groups. We will also continue to post updates.
BBa_K2216002
BBa_K2216002 is a basic part consisted of Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase from Erwinia pyrifoliae DSM 12163
BBa_K2216003
BBa_K2216003 is a composite part consisted of Promoter+RBS+ald A+RBS+ Malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase+Terminator. The composite part is the whole device that degrade MDA to acetyl-CoA, CO2, NADH, and NADPH. When synthesized by Genscript, it was reported that the sequence is unstable to put on a high copy plasmid, possibly due to the length. The concentration of DNA became very low after plasmid extraction, restriction digestion, and gel extraction. Therefore, we are unable to complete and submit the standard parts by deadline.
