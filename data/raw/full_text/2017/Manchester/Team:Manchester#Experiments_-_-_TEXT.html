Notes before starting:
Add ethanol (96-100%) to buffer PE before use (see bottle label for volume)
All centrifugation steps are carried out at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm) in a conventional table-top microcentrifuge at room temperature
Add 1:250 volume pH indicator I to Buffer PB. The yellow color of Buffer PB with pH indicator I indicates a pH of ≤7.5. If the purified PCR product is to be used in sensitive microarray applications, it may be beneficial to use Buffer PB without the addition of pH indicator I. Do not add pH indicator I to buffer aliquots
Methods:
Add 5 volumes Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR reaction and mix. If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10μl 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The color of the mixture will turn yellow
Place a QIAquick column in a provided 2 ml collection tube
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 seconds until all the samples have passed through the column. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube
To wash, add 0.75ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 seconds. Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube
Centrifuge the QIAquick column once more in the provided 2ml collection tube for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer
Place each QIAquick column in a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube
To elute DNA, add 50μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. For increased DNA concentration, add 30μl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel

Gel Extraction (QIAgen Gel Extraction Kit)
Materials (consumables):
Buffer QG
Buffer PE
Buffer PB
3M Sodium Acetate
Sterile dH2O (MiliQ) water
Isopropanol
Methods:
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel
Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes Buffer QG to 1 volume gel (100mg gel ~ 100μl). The maximum amount of gel per spin column is 400mg. For >2% agarose gels, add 6 volumes Buffer QG
Incubate at 50°C for 10 min (or until the gel slice has completely dissolved). Vortex the tube every 2–3 min to help dissolve gel. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the mixture is yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10μl 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix. The mixture turns yellow
Add 1 gel volume isopropanol to the sample and mix
Transfer 750µl of supernatant to a column placed on a 1.5ml eppendorf. Centrifuge at 11,000 rpm for 1 min
Discard flow through. Place column in a new Eppendorf tube. Add 500µl of PB buffer and centrifuge column at 13,000 rpm for 30 seconds

Cell Fixation (using paraformaldehyde)
Materials (consumables):
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
PBS + 2% paraformaldehyde
Method:
Using a fresh transformation plate prepare overnights as follows:
10ml LB
10μl of each antibiotic as required (Chloramphenicol for localization tags and Ampicillin for Eut)
Inoculate media with a single colony
Grow overnight at 37⁰C
Prepare fresh liquid cultures as follows:
10ml LB
10μl of each antibiotic as required
Inoculate with 200μl of overnight culture
Grow to OD600 of 0.1, or for roughly 1 hour and induce the whole liquid culture with IPTG, Tet and/or Arabinose as required (IPTG for EutS, Tet for MN & Ara for LK. Tags are constitutive and don't need inducing).
Add 10μl of 100mM IPTG for 100μM, 2.34μl of 214μM Tet for 50nM & 10μl of 100mM Ara for 100μM.
Incubate induced samples at 30⁰C and take out at desired time-points (I found 2 and 3 hours are sufficient).
At each time-point remove 1ml of each liquid culture and place in 1.5ml eppendorfs.
Spin down at 5000rpm for 2 minutes in a table top centrifuge and discard supernatant.
Resuspend pellet in 1ml PBS and spin down again at 5000rpm for 2 minutes, discarding supernatant.

-This suspension is now ready to make slides with.
Preparing Microscope Slides
Materials (consumables):
Fixed cell suspension
Blank microscope slides
Cover slips
Method:
Pipette 12μl of suspension to a slide and add a cover slip.
Press cover slip down slightly (this helps put all cells in the same plane so it's easier to focus the microscope).
Allow to dry out of direct light to avoid photo bleaching (under blue roll is sufficient).
Store somewhere dark like a slide box or wrapped in lens cloth.
-These slides are now ready to be visualized with fluorescence microscopy.
Image Analysis (CellProfiler)
Analysis Modules:
ApplyThreshold
IdentifyPrimaryObjects
IdentifyPrimaryObjects
MeasureObjectSizeShape
ExportToSpreadsheet
Method:
-(This protocol is meant to inform CellProfiler users of our method of image analysis, not teach users how to use the software. For tutorials on how to use CellProfiler, visit: http://cellprofiler.org/examples/ or http://cellprofiler.org/tutorials/ )
Select the ‘Images’ option in the ‘Input modules’ window and drag and drop the target image into the file list.
Select ‘NamesAndTypes’ in the ‘Input modules’ window and enter a value in the ‘Name to assign these images’ box, e.g. “raw_data” and click update.
Right click in the ‘Analysis modules’ window and navigate to Add>All>ApplyThreshold. This will filter out any background noise. From the ‘Select the input image’ drop-down menu, select “raw_data” and name the output image, e.g. “ThreshGreen”. The threshold will need to be tweaked to match the picture, so set the ‘Threshold strategy’ to Manual and change the ‘Manual threshold’ value to match your image (the results can be previewed by clicking the ‘Start Test Mode’ button in the bottom left and using the ‘Step’ button to step through Analysis modules).
Add another module by navigating Add>All>IdentifyPrimaryObjects. Select input as your threshold image e.g. ThreshGreen and name the objects to be identified e.g. Cells. Tweak the typical diameter range of the objects to roughly match your target objects. Select ‘Yes’ to discard objects outside the diameter range and select ‘No’ to discard objects touching the border. Like before set the threshold strategy to manual and tweak to match your image (Use Start Test Mode>Step to preview results to get the optimum identification).
Add another IdentifyPrimaryObjects module, this time for identification of microcompartments. Change the name of the primary objects e.g. Microcompartments, keep settings the same as the previous step but change the typical diameter and threshold values to match the smaller, brighter objects.
Add another module by navigating Add>All>MeasureObjectSizeShape. In ‘select object to measure’ select Cells. Click ‘Add another object’ and select Microcompartments.
Add another module by navigating Add>All>ExportToSpreadsheet. Select column delimiter as “Tab” and select ‘output file location’ as ‘default output folder’ (make sure to set this correctly by clicking ‘view output settings’ and selecting the preferred output folder). Set the ‘Filename prefix’ e.g. “MyExpt_”. Select ‘Yes’ to ‘Select the measurements to export’ and press the button to select measurements. Here you can select which data you want to be exported, in the case of determining circularity of microcompartments, navigate All>Microcompartments>AreaShape>Eccentricity and tick, and also tick All>Microcompartments>Number. In this example an Excel file will be generated with data about circularity of microcompartments which allows them to be ranked by how properly they have formed.
After all modules have been configured and a default output folder selected, click on ‘Analyze Images’ to perform analysis and output data.
-This covers the analysis modules for this simple protocol but a more in-depth, custom analysis of data is possible. Different data can be exported to excel, correlation of different fluorescence tags can be analysed, and images with object outlines can be exported (see links above).
DAPI Staining
Materials (consumables):
Fixed cell suspension
0.3% Triton-X-100
PBS
DAPI (2mg/ml)
Blank microscope slides
Cover slips
Method:
Follow steps 1-8 of the Cell Fixation (using paraformaldehyde) protocol.
Make the cells permeable by treating them with 100µl of 0.3% (v/v) Triton-X-100 solution for 5 minutes.
Spin down at 5000rpm for 2 minutes in a table top centrifuge, discard the supernatant and resuspend in 50µl PBS.
(All the further steps must be carried out in the dark.)
Add 50µl of DAPI to the eppendorf and leave for 30 minutes.
Spin down at 5000rpm for 2 minutes, discard the supernatant and resuspend in 50µl PBS.
Pipette 12μl of suspension to a slide, add a cover slip and allow to dry in the dark.
Observe the slides under confocal microscope by setting the excitation filter at 370nm and emission filter at 526nm.
(Adapted from the protocol found here ).
Thermal Stability Assay
Materials (consumables):
Dye MasterMix: 0.12% Syro Orange Dye in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2)
Protein Solutions (concentration varies depending on protein - we recommend an optimisation stage is conducted prior to the full protocol being run)
Methods:
Add 30uL of dye mastermix to each well (in a 96-well plate).
Add 10uL of protein solution to the corresponding wells, and 10uL buffer into the control wells.
Run reaction in a CFX connect real-time system from 25C to 95C, at 0.4C intervals. Take measurements after 30secs at each temperature.

Stirring plate
Dialysis tubing and clips
VivaSpin columns with appropriate molecular weight cut off
Lysis Buffer pH 8 (250mM NaCl, 25mM Tris, 10mM Imidazole, 5mg/L Lysozyme, 5mg/L DNaseI, Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor)
Wash Buffer 1 pH 8 (250mM NaCl, 25mM Tris, 10mM Imidazole)
Wash Buffer 2 pH 8 (250mM NaCl, 25mM Tris, 50mM Imidazole)
Elution Buffer pH 8 (250mM NaCl, 25mM Tris, 200mM Imidazole)
Methods:
Clean affinity media: Ni-NTA agarose can be stored in 20% ethanol to prolong its shelf life, wash away the ethanol by pipetting the Ni-NTA agarose slurry into a plastic gravity flow column and washing with 10 bed volumes of distilled water. Then equilibrate with 5 bed volumes of wash buffer. Cap the column and keep the affinity media in wash buffer 1 until use
Pre-chill all buffers. Prepare Lysis buffer on the day it is to be used.
Transfer cell pellet to a closed container with 5ml of pre-chilled lysis buffer per gram of cell pellet. Allow to thaw on rollers at 4°C for 30 minutes.
Disrupt cells by sonication on ice.
Separate cell debris from soluble protein by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C. Transfer supernatant to a fresh tube.
Resuspend the Ni-NTA agarose into a slurry in the wash buffer 1 by pipetting up and down.
Add 1 ml of Ni-NTA slurry to the lysate supernatant. Note that for large volumes of supernatant, a larger volume of slurry will be needed. We used an excess of 1 ml of slurry for every 50 ml of supernatant. Mix the slurry and lysate on rollers for >30 minutes in rollers at 4°C.
Load the lysate into a plastic gravity flow column at 4°C and collect flow through. Keep all fractions on ice.
Wash the resin with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer 1, then wash buffer 2, collect fractions.
Elute the protein with 5 bed volumes of elution buffer.
Analyse fractions by SDS-PAGE.
Transfer fraction containing the recombinant protein to dialysis tubing and dialyse into an excessive volume of the desired buffer at 4°C with gentle stirring. Replace the buffer after 45 minutes, then repeat.
Concentrate the purified protein using a VivaSpin column according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Measure the absorbance at 280 nm of the purified protein, and calculate the final concentration using the proteins’ extinction coefficient. This can be calculated by inputting the proteins’ primary sequence into a tool like ProtParam from ExPASy.
Add Glycerol to a final concentration of 5% v/v and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at -80°C.
