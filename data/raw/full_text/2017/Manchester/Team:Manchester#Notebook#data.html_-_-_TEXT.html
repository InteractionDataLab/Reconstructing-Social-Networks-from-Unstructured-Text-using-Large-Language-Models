pSB1C3-EutMN miniprep, restriction digest and agarose gel = expected result.. now can send for sequencing!
pSB1C3-EutLK colony PCR. Result = all negatives. So try to optimize the digestion and ligation of EutLK into pSB1C3.
PPK Design of Experiments: to optimise expression, the following factors and their interactions were considered: OD600 (at time of induction); post-induction temperature; post-induction harvest time; IPTG concentration.
Call with Dr. Benjamin Tam from Isle Utilities!!

pSB1C3-EutLK Colony PCR showed all negative results.
Overexpression (conditions determined by previous DoE experiments conducted) and purification of the PPK constructs using a nickel affinity column. Once isolated, each will be used in an ADPglo (Promega) assay to assess kinetics regarding polyphosphate production.

Monday, September 11th
pSB1C3-eutS/MN/SMN/LK induction experiments: using fresh transformants and only inducing for 4hrs (suspect that proteins are toxic, as we are struggling to see their production, the cultures grow very slowly, and cloning them in the first place was difficult).
Tuesday, September 12th
Wednesday, September 13th
Thursday, September 14th.
Since western blot for Eut protein analysis are not showing any results, we are going to try to assess eutM production after 4 and 20hrs using the plate reader (eutM is tagged with GFP).
