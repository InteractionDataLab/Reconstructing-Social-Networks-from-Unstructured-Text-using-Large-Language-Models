At the same time, whilst we understand such possibility is granted to us by law, not many realise the extent to which law may incentivise, guide, shape and, at times, limit our efforts. It originates from politics, creates institutional procedures, gives life to new businesses, dictates the pace of scientific progress, and affects consumer choices. In this, law reflects the perceptions of its creators while its creators reflect diversity of the country’s citizens. In this, law is diverse.

In this collaboration, we aimed at creating a document that would illustrate that very depth and diversity of law. For this reason, the first issue we discussed is law-related politics, the second its bureaucracy, third law’s impact on business, fourth on science and finally on consumer behaviour. Willing to gain an even deeper understanding of GMM legislations, we have invited 15 teams from different countries to participate in these collaborative efforts. In the end, the final document has been created by 127 iGEMers from 10 teams, 10 countries, 7 different iGEM tracks and 5 continents. Have a look at the fruits of the 3 months-long interactions, discussions and meet-ups.

What institutional body enforces the laws regarding the use of GMMs?</H3><P>The institutional bodies that enforce the laws regarding the use of GMMs differ a lot across the world. In many countries in Asia (Japan, Indonesia, and Korea) and Canada, ministries and departments are responsible for enforcing the laws of GMMs. The kinds of ministries enforcing the laws as well as their numbers vary from country to country, but usually the large organizations are in charge.

On the other hand, countries like India, Brazil, the United States, and Australia have more specialied committees or institutions of biotechnology and biosafety and these committees are responsible for enforcing the laws.

In the European Union, the European Commission is responsible for enforcing the GMO laws to be followed by all member countries. Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology, but has responsible institutions when commercing or trading.</P><P><I>*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*</I></P><DIV class="boxinbox"><P class="Qus displayno">Stemming from research from the University of Virginia and EMBO, the J. Craig Venter Policy Center Team has concluded that the United States lack an agency that specifically focuses on enforcing laws regarding GMMs. Instead, there is legislation such as the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology and the President's Commission for studying Bio-ethical issues, which was established by Barack Obama. As of now, the regulatory agency with the most regulatory control on issues regarding synthetic biology is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).</P><P class="Qcanada displayno">In accordance with <I>Foods and Drugs Act</I>, Health Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada are the administrative branches responsible for the regulation of products derived from biotechnology. Health Canada’s role is to enforce standards for safety and nutritional quality of all foods sold in Canada. It works under the <I>Foods and Drugs Act</I>. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) role is to minimize diseases and other public health hazards that could potentially be caused by the food supply system. Fisheries and Oceans Canada role is to regulate Canadian fisheries, oceans and freshwater resources. This joint effort helps ensure that informed decisions regarding GMMs by pooling the expertise and considerations of each agency together.</P><P class="Quk displayno">European Commission is the institution responsible for proposing and implementing legislations applying to all member countries. Member countries may additionally restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMMs in their territory. This possibility, however, is regulated by Directive (EU) 2015/412 adopted by the EU.</P><P class="Qaus displayno">In Australia, the use of GMMs is regulated under a nationwide legislative framework consisting of two main branches: the Gene Technology Regulator and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Individual states and territories also have their own legislation in accordance with this framework.</P><P class="Qbrazil displayno">In Brazil, the Biosafety Law (Law 11105/05) sets the safety rules and fiscalisation of GMMs and its derivatives in the national territory. The National Technical Committee of Biosafety (CTNBio) is responsible for enforcing the laws and setting the rules for the construction, experimentation, cultivation, manipulation, transport, commercialization, consumption, release and discarding of GMMs and its derivatives.</P><P class="Qchile displayno">Chile doesn’t have a clear regulation for biotechnology. However, the Agricultural and Livestock Service is responsible for the importation, sowing and propagation of GMOs, also regulating the exportation of seeds (Law N° 3.557/82 actualised Law N°1523/2001). The Ministry of Health, on the other hand, regulates the labelling of food made with the use of GMOs (Article 107).</P><P class="Qindia displayno">India is currently undergoing a massive overhaul in their laws and regulations regarding GMOs. Currently, there is a proposed “Regulations and guidelines on biosafety of recombinant DNA research and biocontainment, 2017’ draft that has been prepared and opened for comments. Currently, under the proposal, the following 6 bodies are in charge of enforcing laws regarding GMOs and GMMs - 1. Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RDAC) - Advisory2. Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) - Regulatory/ Approval3. Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) - Regulatory/ Approval4. Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) - Regulatory/ Approval5. State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC) - Regulatory/ Approval6.

</P><P class="Qindonesia displayno">The laws regarding the use of GMMs are regulated by 4 ministries: The Ministry of Agriculture, The Ministry of Forestry and Plantation, The Ministry of Health, and The Ministry of Food and Horticulture. They created the Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 21 year of 2005 (PP No. 21/2005) on Biosafety of GMO.</P><P class="Qjapan displayno">In Japan, mainly Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment is responsible for the use of GMMs. With these ministries at the core, other institutions such as Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare are also responsible for GMMs in each related field.</P><P class="Qkorea displayno">The usage of the GMMs in Korea is strictly regulated by the <I>GMO Law</I>, established on Jan 28, 2001. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy takes charge of this law.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="Question"><H3>2. Who regulates the use of GMMs on a case-by-case basis?</H3><P>
We can distinguish two different administrative ways in which countries decided to regulate the use of GMMs. One way government regulate GMMs is by establishing a special, often non-governmental, organisation, which usually also acts as an information centre in the field of synthetic biology. The other way involves assigning conventional ministries to regulate the use of GMMs in their respective fields.

The European Union, Australia, and Indonesia belong to the first group. For example, in Australia, <I>Gene Technology Regulator Advisory Committee</I> takes charge of making decisions on products’ approval. <I>Competent authorities</I> in the European Union and <I>The Biosafety Commission and The Technical Team for Biosafety</I> in Indonesia have similar roles.

Brazil, Canada, Chile, Korea, India, Japan and the US belong to the second group, where conventional ministries are responsible for their respective fields. Even though the names of these ministries might differ amongst the countries, it seems to be a more prevalent way to regulate GMO. Additional information centres might be present to help the ministries make decisions, nonetheless.</P><P><I>*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*</I></P><DIV class="boxinbox"><P class="Qus displayno">The US Food and Drug Administration regulates any GMMs that get used in consumer products, such as GMMs in food or cosmetics.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Supply (MAPA) is responsible for regulating the use of modified seeds and plants. All GMMs must be approved for release by CTNBio.</P><P class="Qchile displayno">Environment Ministry regulates crops for production with environmental impact service (SEA) (Law N° 19.300/1994).

Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) [formerly known as Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), has been established under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&amp;CC). The major functions of GEAC as prescribed in the Rules 1989 are:i. To appraise activities involving large scale use of hazardous microorganisms and recombinants in research and industrial production from the environmental angle.ii. To appraise proposals relating to release of genetically engineered organisms and products into the environment including experimental field trials.iii. The committee or any persons authorized by it has powers to take punitive action under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The SBCC is a monitoring committee at State level and it shall have powers:i. To inspect, investigate and to take punitive action in case of violations of statutory provisions through the State Pollution Control Board or the Directorate of Health etc.ii. To review periodically the safety and control measures in various institutions handling GE Organisms.iii. To act as nodal agency at State level to assess the damage, if any, due to release of GE Organisms and to take on site control measures.

There shall be a District Level Biotechnology Committee (DLC) in the districts wherever necessary under the District Collectors to monitor the safety regulations in installations engaged in the use of genetically modified organisms/ hazardous microorganisms and its applications in the environment.

The District Level Committee/or any other person/s authorized in this behalf shall visit the installation engaged in activity involving genetically engineered organisms, hazardous microorganisms, formulate information chart, find out hazards and risks associated with each of these installations and coordinate activities with a view to meeting any emergency. They shall also prepare an off-site emergency plan. The District Level Committee shall regularly submit its report to the SBCC/ GEAC.

What legal requirements do I have to fulfil in order to be able to use GMMs in my business?</H3><P>The legal requirements in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and India are very similar. All uses of GMOs require risk assessments to be run before the start of the production. The exact procedures related to obtaining permissions to use GMOs in the production vary, however, according to the target use of the final products or the way the GMOs are handled in the production process. As a general rule, products related to human health as well as those used as food or feed have to follow stricter GMO procedures, such as obtaining approvals from several ministries or labelling your final products in a predescribed manner. Environmental release of GMOs is also given serious attention although the procedures are not as tight, just as in the case of contained GMO use. Usually, the target use also dictates which Ministry will be responsible for the evaluation and approval of the planned GMO use. These could include Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Food, Fisheries, Forestry, Environment and many more.

In Korea, the procedure is also similar but it requires a payment of a examination fee that costs 4000 dollars. In the USA, GMO plants are considered equivalent to non-GMO plants and do not require much further approval; only if the plant express a protein that is significantly different from any protein originally expressed, will a respective institution be required to approve of such use. In Chile, on the other hand, it is forbidden to commercialise GMOs as only seed exportation is allowed.</P><P><I>*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*</I></P><DIV class="boxinbox"><P class="Qus displayno">Under FDA regulations, most plant GMOs are considered equivalent to non-GMOs and do not require much further approval. However, if the modified plant expresses a protein that is significantly different from any protein it originally expressed, then the business must get approval from the FDA. 

To receive EPA approval for GMOs with the Bt toxin, the business must conduct a food-safety analysis and verify that the toxin will be safe for the environment. GMOs without this toxin can be freely used.

This process involves providing detailed information about the host, donor, transferred DNA, properties of the GMM and where it will be grown. A formal risk assessment is then carried out by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator who then make a decision as to whether a licence will be granted.
</P><P class="Qbrazil displayno">In order to use a GMM in your business, one needs to fulfill numerous requirements. The development of any GMM must be monitored by the CTNBio and the regulatory agencies. If your company is going to start working with GMM, the first step is getting the Certified of Biosafety by CTNBio and create an internal committee of biosafety. Then, you need the approval by the regulatory agency (e.g. Anvisa for human purposes and the MAPA for agriculture purposes). You are going to need to fulfill a lot of requirements in order to get the registry and the permission to develop your research in your lab.
For <B>agriculture purposes</B>, once you have finished your research inside the lab, the CTNBio will evaluate it and emit a position paper that will allow you to do a planned and controlled release.

Initially, the company developing the GMOs undertakes several biosafety assessments including, environmental, food, and feed safety assessments in containment.2. This is followed by Bio-safety Research Trials which require prior approval of the regulators, the GEAC and the RCGM.3. Approval for large scale Field Trials and evaluation protocol for environmental release is accorded by the GEAC after considering the findings of bio-safety studies.4.

To fulfill the Environmental Safety, the GMMs need to have clear information regarding the description and objective of use, the detected phenotypic and genotypic changes, the taxonomical identity, the physiology and reproduction, the inserted gene origin, the genetic engineering method adopted, the molecular characteristic, the product of gene expression, and the method to destruct the GMMs when any disruptions happen. To fulfill the Food and Feed Safety, the GMMs need to have clear information regarding the genetic engineering method adopted, the nutritional (includes the protein, carbohydrate, fat, amino acid, fatty acid, minerals, and vitamins) content of the GMMs have to be substantially similar with the non-GMMs, the content of any toxic substance and allergens have to be substantially similar with the non-GMMs, the protein product expressed by the gene need to be non-allergenic.</P><P class="Qjapan displayno">A. If you use GMMs in an open system (e.g. agriculture use, bioremediation use)

In the use of open system, first, you have to apply for the approval of use regulations with the evaluation sheet of biodiversity influence to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of the Environment. Once you got approval, you can start using GMMs. At the same time, you have to report the results of the information collected after using GMMs. And you will also get site inspections by Ministries written above as well as independent administrative institutions (FAMIC, NARO, NLBC, FRA). As a result, you will get administrative orders and you have to follow these order by re-submitting information or change/annulment of the use regulations. 

B. If you use GMMs in closed system (e.g. using GMMs for production of enzymes/catalysts, using GMMs for production of reagents/ industrial materials)

If you use GMMs inside faculties and prevent GMMs to diffuse, first you have to check if the GMM you're using is on the GILSP list. If it is on the list, you have to follow the steps to prevent diffusions that are prescribed and start using GMMs. Then, you have to report using situations and you will get inspections and orders. If the GMM is not on the GILSP list, you have to fill in a diffusion prevention measures sheet and send it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Once those measures are approved, you will follow the same steps above.
</P><P class="Qkorea displayno">For the usage of the GMOs, an individual has to submit the examination application form for Biosafety, with 4000 dollars of examination fee, to the Ministry that is in charge of the usage. Which means, if you are willing to use the GMOs related to agriculture, it is the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs that you have to submit the application to. The examination of the GMO is done in two different aspects. One is the human body risks and the other is the environmental risks. The Ministry of Korea Centers for Disease Control and prevention proceeds the former test, and Three institutes, including The Ministry of Environment, Rural Development Administration, and National Fisheries Research &amp; Development Institute proceeds the latter test. About 210 days are required for each of the examinations. 

After all the processes, one can finally get the Biosafety report for the GMOs. the result is posted on the site (Korea Biosafety Clearing House) so that the data is available to not only the applicant, but also to anyone interested.

As an employer who exposes their workers to biological agents, what safety measures am I obliged to adopt?</H3><P>It can be noticed all countries participating in this collaboration, share the standard protocols of good practices in a laboratory, which includes the following:• Reduce the risk of manipulation to the maximum.• Identify the level of risk.• Use of necessary safety equipment for each activity.• Maintain the necessary information and supervision with trained personnel.• Maintain an infection prevention protocol and equipment in case of emergency.• Good hygiene of workers.• Special conditions and restrictions on air circulation.• Waste disposal protocols, among others.

In the United States, Australia, Brazil and Indonesia, these protocols for the manipulation of biological agents are all that is required to protect the workers involved. On the other hand, the European Union, Japan and India also require medical records of all workers exposed to biological agents to be kept for a specified period of time. Japan additionally requires the employers to hold medical check-ups every 6 months for the exposed workers. The legislations of EU, Korea, Canada, Chile and India group biological agents according to the risk they might create. These groups, in turn, determine what safety measures are to be taken in each case.

In Korea, Canada and Chile, the facilities must also be located in an isolated or secluded location. Chile only requires it for biosafety levels 3 and 4. Finally, Korea and India require the existence of a decontamination room between the work area and the outside.</P><P><I>*Click on each flag to see the response of each individual team!*</I></P><DIV class="boxinbox"><P class="Qus displayno">Employers are not required to adopt any specific safety measures just because their workers will be exposed to biological agents. Instead, under OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), they are only required to address any health concerns a specific organism might pose. </P><P class="Qcanada displayno">The specific guidelines facilities adopt depend on the risk group classification of the agents involved. For the handling of biological materials under Risk Group 1, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and CFIA recommends containment level 1 (CL1) safety guidelines, however no requirements are specified. Risk group 1 includes any biological materials that are potentially pathogenic to humans or animals, but are very unlikely to be so, or are not pathogenic at all. Some recommendations for CL1 facilities outlined in the Canadian Biosafety Standard are as follows:1. The designated areas for handling biological materials should be separated from public areas and administrative work areas. 2. There should be designated hand and eye wash stations appropriate for facility operations. 3. Appropriate personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses, lab coats and, footwear covering the feet, must be worn.4. Only authorized personnel and visitors should be allowed in the facility.5. Waste materials must be disposed in the proper containers and wastes that came into contact with biological materials must be decontaminated before disposal.6. Proper hand washing techniques must be employed after coming into contact with biological materials.7. Procedures must incorporate proper aseptic technique and minimizes contamination and the formation of aerosols.8. Food and drinks should be prohibited from the lab.9. Personnel must be trained for the safe handling and storing of biological materials to protect them.10. Safety guidelines must be kept up-to-date.


To work with biological materials in higher risk groups (2, 3, and 4), in addition to adopting the appropriate containment level, a Pathogen and Toxin Licence must be obtained from PHAC. Although CL1 provides the foundational biosafety guidelines for these containment levels, further requirements must be followed to minimize contamination and hazards to personnel working with high risk group pathogens. Additional information for the operations of these controlled facilities are discussed in the Canadian Biosafety Standard Second Edition handbook.

In Australia, there is no such law for GMM products.

In terms of international trade (export, import), countries like the United States, India, and Korea have clear laws detailing the procedures. They have taken permission and submission of documents to the law regarding this export and import of GMM uses. In European countries, these directly come under the laws of regulations of GMMs. There seems to be no specific laws regulating international GMM trade in Australia, Japan, Korea and Canada.

The most important documents related to GMMs are concerned with biosafety, food, trade and production processes. In places such as India, European Union, United States, Brazil, Japan, Canada, there are many different laws regulating each of these issues. On the other hand, Korea, Indonesia, and Australia have only one or two laws governing all these issues.

As any scientific field, synthetic biology makes enormous contributions to the development of a more sustainable future. iGEM teams alone have created numerous projects, thus helping solve environmental, medical and nutritional problems. When left unchecked, however, gene modification may interfere with natural biodiversity and lead to irreversible outcomes. Government’s laissez-faire approach to the field of synthetic biology is, therefore, hardly ever seen. Yet the crux of the matter seems to be finding the golden mean as banning GMOs altogether would not necessarily make the world a safer place.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer-right"><P>Connect with us:</P><P> Email: manchesterigem17@gmail.com </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
