The Manchester iGEM 2017 team have improved part BBa_K562001 , originally submitted by team Dundee 2011 .
We have removed the illegal XbaI site at 179 in BBa_K562001 to make it biobrick compatible.
We have also further improved this part by adding different Anderson promoters ( Low BBa_J23105 , Medium BBa_J23108 , High BBa_J23104 ) to control the expression level of the localisation tag.
This enables optimisation of localisation for specific purposes. For example, when targeting a particularly large protein, it may be advantageous to use a lowly expressing promoter to prevent any disturbance to micro-compartment formation.
