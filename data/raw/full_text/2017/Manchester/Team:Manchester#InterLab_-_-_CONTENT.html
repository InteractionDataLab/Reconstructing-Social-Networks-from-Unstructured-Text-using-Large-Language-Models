However, the direct comparison of fluorescence data is problematic as data is often reported in different units or processed in different ways. This inability to directly compare results makes it harder to work collaboratively between laboratories and thus hinders the advancement of research. Therefore, it is important that a standardised protocol be established, so that groups around the world can achieve better, more streamlined fluorescence measurements. The Fourth International Laboratory Measurement Study aims to test the effectiveness of this standardised protocol by answering the important question: How close can the numbers be when fluorescence is measured all around the world using the same exact protocol?</P><P>Manchester iGEM 2017 is proud to have taken part in the Interlab study for the first time. We hope our participation will help benefit other iGEM teams and the synthetic biology community as a whole. <A href="#top" class="indexlink">Back to top</A></P></DIV><DIV class="plan" style="padding: 0px 5vw; border: 3px solid transparent"><H4 id="protocol">Protocols</H4><DIV class="plan" style="padding: 0px 5vw; border: 3px solid transparent"><P>Aseptic technique was maintained at all times.</P><H3><B>Transformation</B></H3><P>The E.coli strain used was Dh5α.

The tubes were incubated overnight at 37°C and 180 rpm.</P><H3><B>Plate Reader Settings</B></H3><P>Measurements of optical density at 600 nm (OD600) and fluorescence were taken using a BMG LabTech Clariostar plate reader, provided to us by the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB). OD600 measurements were all taken at 24°C with 35 flashes, and an orbital averaging of 3. Fluorescence measurements were taken with 8 flashes and a gain of 748.

The fluorescein stock was then serially diluted in four replicates (A2-A12, B2-B12, C2-C12, D2-D12) by mixing with 1x PBS to obtain 100 µl of 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625, 0.78125, 0.390625, 0.1953125, 0.09765625, 0.048828125, and 0 µM of fluorescein solution. Fluorescence was then measured using a BMG LabTech ClarioStar plate reader, and a fluorescence standard curve generated <B>(Figure 1)</B>.

Out of all the devices tested, only device 2 exhibited the expected trend, the fluorescence of cells increasing with time. Device 4 and the positive control also display this trend up to 4 h before decreasing. However, this decrease could be explained by our cells dying after 6 hours.
The negative control displays fluorescence, which was not supposed to happen. We suspect that this may be due to contamination or autofluorescence of colony 2. Colony 1, which was not contaminated, showed very low levels of fluorescence, similar to those seen in device 3 and 6 (See Full Results).</P><P>We removed the 4 h time point for device 1 from figure 2. This particular time point exhibited high fluorescence at low OD, and significantly changed the scale of the graph . We suspect that this was potentially due to human error in loading the media.

This is most likely due to human error when transferring samples.</P><H3><B>Additional work</B></H3><P>We wanted to take full advantage of the Interlab project and use it to improve upon the skills that we have gained since beginning the experimental part of our project. For this reason, we decided to make our own DH5α competent cells. This also gave the rest of the team plenty of stock to work with whilst they continued to complete their own experiments. 
We used the Benchling protocol which can be found here: <A target="_blank" https:="">https://benchling.com/protocols/PqDdikG7/tss-competent-e-coli-preparation</A></P><H3><B>Transformation</B></H3><P>Initially we struggled to obtain colonies from the transformation of test kit 7, refining our protocol led us to successfully transform kit 6. This protocol has since been adopted by other members of our team to improve the efficiency of their own transformations. Our protocol is as follows:</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- 2 μl of DNA was added to 100 μl of competent DH5α E.coli cells.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- Cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- Cells were heat shocked in water bath set at 42°C for 30 seconds.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- 800 μl of SOC media was added and cells were incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- Cells were then spun down in a tabletop centrifuge for 2 minutes at 5000 rpm.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- 600 μl of the supernatant was removed and the pellet re-suspended in the remaining supernatant.</P><P style="margin-left: 40px">- The remaining 200 μl of re-suspended cells were then plated.</P><H3><B>Miniprep and restriction digest</B></H3><P>As we initially struggled to transform all the devices in kit plate 7, transformations which yielded colonies were miniprepped and the purity and concentration of the DNA was assessed using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. We then performed a restriction digest (using XbaI and PstI) and ran the DNA on an agarose gel. This confirmed that our transformations had not been successful in all cases, as the results did not match the band size that we predicted using SnapGene. Conversely, the successful transformation of all devices from kit plate 6 was confirmed using the same technique. At this point we then prepared overnight cultures ready for the plate reader measurement Interlab protocol. <A href="#top" class="indexlink">Back to top</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER class="footer-distributed"><DIV class="footer-right"><P>Connect with us:</P><P> Email: manchesterigem17@gmail.com </P></DIV></FOOTER></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
