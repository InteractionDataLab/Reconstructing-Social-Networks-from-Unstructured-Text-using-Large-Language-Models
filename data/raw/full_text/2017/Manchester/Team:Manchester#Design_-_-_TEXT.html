Design
Design is the first step in the design-build-test cycle in engineering and synthetic biology. Use this page to describe the process that you used in the design of your parts. You should clearly explain the engineering principles used to design your project.
This page is different to the "Applied Design Award" page. Please see the Applied Design page for more information on how to compete for that award.
What should this page contain?
Explanation of the engineering principles your team used in your design
Discussion of the design iterations your team went through
Experimental plan to test your designs
