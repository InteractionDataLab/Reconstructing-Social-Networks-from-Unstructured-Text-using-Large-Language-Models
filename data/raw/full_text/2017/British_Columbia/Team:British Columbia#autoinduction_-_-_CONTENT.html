        In the natural life cycle of <I>Agrobacterium</I>, both the conjugation (bacterial cell to bacterial cell plasmid transfer) and virulence (bacterial cell to plant cell plasmid transfer) system are induced by environmental factors. The conjugation system is regulated by a quorum sensing system and responds to molecules secreted by <I>Agrobacterium</I> induced tumours. Therefore, the conjugation machinery is triggered at certain cell densities during <I>Agrobacterium</I> infection of plant cells. Once the <I>Agrobacterium Ti</I> plasmid is inside a plant cell, secretion of bacterial metabolites called opines are activated. At certain concentration of opines inside <I>Agrobacterium</I> cells, <I>traR</I> activator transcription is initiated, which, in turn, activates the translation of other Tra proteins (Fuqua et al., 1994). The virulence system is induced off plant-produced metabolites, to ensure that virulent attack only occurs when there is a growing plant nearby (Satchel et. al, 1985). A common <I>Agrobacterium</I> gene inducer is acetosyringone, a molecule produced by plants when wounded (Ashby et. al, 1987). Acetosyringone interacts with transmembrane virulence (<I>vir</I>) genes, which in turn induce the transcription of many other Vir proteins (Winans et. al. 1988). Our team sought to employ the natural cell induction machinery to specifically activate Cas9 protein expression only in cases of prevalent <I>Agrobacterium</I> in the environment or pre-existing <I>Agrobacterium</I> infection. We selected three promoters - <I>traR, traA/traC</I> bidirectional promoter (<I>traAC</I>) and <I>virB1</I> to test their ability specifically activate protein expression in our system.

      To test the induction of several native <I>Agrobacterium</I> promoters, such as <I>PtraR</I>, <I>PtraAC</I>, <I>PvirB1</I> we synthesized the short sequences upstream of the corresponding coding regions flanked with BioBrick Prefix and Suffix so that for any future endeavours these promoters would be easily accessible to future iGEM teams. We placed these promoters upstream of <I>RFP</I> in <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1357010">K1357010</A> and <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J04650">J04650</A> parts, then cloned the promoter-reporter fusions into modified <I>pCAMBIA-MCS</I> (more details about plasmid design can be found in the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:British_Columbia/plasmid_maintenance">Plasmid Maintenance</A> section of our wiki), a plasmid able to replicate in both <I>E.coli</I> and <I>Agrobacterium</I>. These promoter-reporter constructs were transformed into <I>Agrobacterium</I> and assayed. The <I>virB1</I> promoter was assessed for its sensitivity to acetosyringone by measuring RFP production. Likewise, the <I>traR</I> promoter’s activity was measured in response to induction by opines. Though both promoters are predicted to display activity in response to inducers dosage, we expect they will only promote RFP activity inside bacteria with all transfer or virulence regulators in place, I.e. <I>Agrobacterium</I> which contain the native Ti plasmid.

        The strains used were <I>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</I> GV3101 and <I>Escherichia coli</I> DH5-Alpha unless otherwise stated. All <I>E. coli</I> cultures were grown in LB media at 37℃ unless otherwise stated. All <I>Agrobacterium</I> were grown in LB at 30℃ unless otherwise stated. All plasmid DNA extractions were performed with Column-Pure Plasmid Mini-Prep Kit (ABM). DNA purification from gels with Column-Pure DNA Gel Recovery Kit (ABM). The same protocols for DNA gel electrophoresis, restriction enzyme digest, DNA ligation, and chemical and electrotransformation were used throughout unless otherwise stated and can be found in the protocols section of the wiki. </P><H2>Cloning promoters into pSB1C3, BBa_K1357010, and BBa_J04650</H2><P>
We ordered three sequences that we suspected were the promoter sequences from <I>virB1</I> (544bp), <I>traR</I> (217bp), and <I>traAC</I> (257bp) from the Ti-plasmid of <I>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</I> and received them in gBlocks from IDT. The promoter fragments, <I>virB1</I>, <I>traR</I>, <I>traAC</I>, and the BioBrick assembly plasmid, pSB1C3, were digested with EcoRI and SpeI enzymes and separated via gel purification. We ligated the two fragments together using T4 ligase. The promoters were also put into BBa_K1357010 and BBa_J04650, reporter plasmids that contain <I>mRFP</I>, with and without a RBS respectively. These reporter plasmids were digested with XbaI and PstI enzymes and the promoters in the pSB1C3 backbone were digested with SpeI and PstI enzymes, gel purified and ligated. </P><H2>Transforming plasmids into <I>E.coli</I> S17-1</H2><P>

To characterize our promoters and prove that they and were inducible by acetosyringone, we performed an assay on the successfully transformed <I>virB1</I> constructs. In order to do this, we inoculated three test tubes of each colony in 5mL of LB+Kan of <I>A. tumefaciens</I> colonies that successfully grew on LB+Kan plates overnight. We diluted the overnight <I>A. tumefaciens</I> cultures to an OD of 0.244 and added 200 uL of culture of the different constructs, <I>virB1</I>+J04650 and <I>virB1</I>+K131357010 into a 96 well plate in triplicates. To the triplicates, we then had three treatments - no acetosyringone, 50 uM of acetosyringone, and 100 uM of acetosyringone. We also had a control treatment where only LB+Kan+varying concentrations of acetosyringone (none, 50 uM, 100 uM) were plated on the 96 well plate. We measured the fluorescence every hour up to six hours and then measured one at 30 hours. Unfortunately, we saw no significant results with this assay.

We redid our assay with the <I>virB1</I> promoter fused with <I>RFP</I> from J04650.

Two tubes from each culture were treated with 100 uM acetosyringone while the third was used as an uninduced control. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row fix" id="results"><DIV class="col-sm-10"><H1 class="section-heading">Results</H1><P>

        Autoinduction is an important tool that can be used to allow inducible control of gene expression. In our project, this could allow for inducible expression of the <I>CRISPR/Cas9</I> system in high cell densities. When expressed at high levels, CRISPR/Cas9 can have toxic effects on the cell (Peters, J. M., et al., 2015), potentially harming aGROW’s ability to propagate and conjugate its engineered plasmid through the infected soil. </P><P>

Our team was able to design constructs that fused inducible promoters derived from <I> A. Tumefaciens </I>with the gene for the reporter molecule RFP. We were able to begin to characterize the <I>virB1</I> promoter’s fusion with <I>RFP</I> J04650, showing preliminary evidence for acetosyringone inducibility as suggested by the literature (Rogowsky, et al., 1987). The weak induction observed in experimentation could be explained as a result of biological mechanism or technical procedure. <I>VirA</I> and <I>virG</I> are generally (Powei, B. S. and Kado, C. I., 1990) both required for <I>virB </I>induction, and each is only weakly inducible by acetosyringone (Rogowsky, et al., 1987). Low levels of these proteins could hamper RFP expression. Further, a previous study has suggested that for induction of <I>virB</I> to occur efficiently, <I>virA</I> and <I>virG</I> should be from the plasmid of origin (Krishnamohan, A., Balaji, V., &amp; Veluthambi, K., 2001). Different plasmids encode different <I>vir</I> boxes (protein-binding regions) inside their promoters (Krishnamohan, A., Balaji, V., &amp; Veluthambi, K., 2001). Our <I>virB1</I> promoter was taken from pTiC58, while <I>virA</I> and <I>virG</I> are derived from the strain GV3101. Lastly, the growth assay listed above was performed using small amounts (&lt;5mL) of culture inside test tubes, while other papers have used larger volumes for similar experiments (Vernade D, Herrera-Estrella A, Wang K, Van Montagu M., 1998). Acetosyringone is listed as a volatile compound (Nollet, L., 2008), making it possible that the increased surface area to volume ratio in our experiment caused the acetosyringone to evaporate before it was able to induce the <I>virB1</I> promoter. It is possible that all of these factors dramatically reduced, or in the case of volatility, prevented the induction of the <I>virB1</I> promoter.

Our results indicate that the <I>virB1</I> promoter is inducible by acetosyringone, a plant wound hormone. However, further inquiry and characterization are required to use the <I>virB1</I> part to quiesce parts such as <I>CRISPR/Cas9</I>.
