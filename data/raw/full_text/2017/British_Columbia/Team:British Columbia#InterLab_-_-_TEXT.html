Parts
The purpose of iGEM’s Interlab study is to establish a standardized GFP measurement protocol that is universal and can produce         the same results despite using different plate readers. In this year’s Interlab study, RBS devices (BCDs) were also         measured by various iGEM teams. Teams that participate in the Interlab study this year are required to follow a standardized         procedure and submit their data using a plate reader.
The official protocol for the Interlab study can be found on the official iGEM Interlab Study page here .         Our data for the Interlab Study is as follows:
Methods
Transformations
The eight plasmids (Positive Control, Negative Control, Test Device 1, Test Device 2, Test Device 3, Test Device 4,         Test Device 5, and Test Device 6) were transformed into competent E.coli DH5-alpha cells using the E.coli Chemical Transformation protocol here .         The transformants were then plated on LB+25 mg/mL Chloramphenicol plates and incubated overnight at 37 degrees Celsius. Two colonies were picked from each plate and inoculated in 5 mL of LB + 25 mg/mL Chloramphenicol overnight at 37         degrees Celsius and 220 rpm.
Calibration
The OD600 reference point and fluorescein standard curves were prepared following the official Interlab Study protocol,         which can be found here .
This was what our standard fluorescence curves looked like:
Measurements
The next day after the inoculation, we measured the OD600 of the overnight cultures using a spectrophotometer. The         cultures were diluted to a target OD600 of 0.02 using the Dilution Calculation Sheet, which can be found here .         We then incubated the cultures at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rpm. We took measurements of the cultures at 0, 2, 4,         and 6 hours of incubation by pipetting 500 uL of each culture into wells on a 96-well plate according to the assigned         layout in the protocol. We made a modification to the protocol by measuring the OD600 and fluorescence after each         time interval, instead of measuring all of the time points at the very end.
