Field trip to Ganzhou
Expert advice
Field trip to Ganzhound!
To make our project more reality, we came to Ganzhou for study.
First of all, we conducted a questionnaire survey of local residents. To find out how they learn about lanthanide and its potential environmental problems. And what's more, to figure out if people could accept a biological solution.
We did a survey about our project. Here are two representative and improtant results.
We can easily find out that most people do believe there are pollutions in the mining process, especially the villagers living near the mining area. And according to what we gain from the local people, due to many reason (the pollution is the mainly one), all the mining work is freeze and many companies are facing bankruptcy. One employees from local mining companies told us that their company is shut down because they don’t fit the environment requirement.
Luckily, we also find that people in Ganzhou are longing for an effetely and low pollution way to break current situation. What’s more, we are also surprised to find out that more than 80% people could accept our project. Which mean there’s a possibility that our project is going to meet them in the future.
At last we took the water samples from the mining area and liver. From that we could further advanced our project by knowing its working environment. Also, get the parameters for our modeling to simulate the real world.
Expert advice
At the beginning of our project design, we consulted the College of Environment at our school. He gave us many suggestions on the feasibility and safety of microbiological methods, also gave us sample on this field. Which help us figure the key of this problem.
