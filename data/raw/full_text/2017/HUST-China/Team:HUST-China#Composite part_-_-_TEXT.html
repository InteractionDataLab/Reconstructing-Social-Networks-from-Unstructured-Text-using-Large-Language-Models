BBa_K2336037
PmrA-PmrB(LBT5)-PmrC-GFP
PmrB protein can phosphorylate PmrA protein once a lanthanide ion binds to LBT5,and the phosphorylated PmrA protein can activate the PmrC promoter, and then GFP would be expressed.
BBa_K2336038
PmrA-PmrB(LBT9)-PmrC-GFP
PmrB protein can phosphorylate PmrA protein once a lanthanide ion binds to LBT9,and the phosphorylated PmrA protein can activate the PmrC promoter, and then GFP would be expressed.
BBa_K2336039
PmrA-PmrB(LBT11)-PmrC-GFP
PmrB protein can phosphorylate PmrA protein once a lanthanide ion binds to LBT11,and the phosphorylated PmrA protein can activate the PmrC promoter, and then GFP would be expressed.
These circuits can sense lanthanide ions and report their concentration by GFP.
