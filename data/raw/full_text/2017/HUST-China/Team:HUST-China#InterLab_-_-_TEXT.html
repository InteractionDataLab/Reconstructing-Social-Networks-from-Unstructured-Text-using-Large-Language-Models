Introduction
It is significant for synthetic biology to develop a reliable and repeatable measurement, the same to all the other engineering disciplines. We HUST-China have volunteered to test some RBS devices (BCDs) that are intended to make gene expression more precise and reliable by measure the expression level of GFP, in order to help the iGEM community collect data about how reliable will these devices turn out to be in labs around the world.

B2. Measurement Steps
Part 1: Prepare the Fluorescein stock solution
More details
①   Spin down fluorescein stock tube to make sure pellet is at the bottom of tube.
②   Prepare 2x fluorescein stock solution (100 μM) by resuspending fluorescein in 1ml of 1xPBS
③   Dilute the 2x fluorescein stock solution using 1xPBS to make a 1x fluorescein solution (final concentration is 50 μM).
④   *Illustration of serial dilution samples in 96 well plate or cuvettes: value decreases by 2-fold with each column (50% in column 2, 25% in column 3, 12.5% in column 4, etc.)

Part 2: Prepare the serial dilutions of Fluorescein
①Add 100 μl of 1xPBS into wells A2, B2, C2, D2....A12, B12, C12, D12.
②Add 200 μl of 1x Fluorescein stock solution into A1, B1, C1, D1.
③   Transfer 100 μl of Fluorescein stock solution from A1 into A2.
④   Mix A2 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A3.
⑤   Mix A3 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A4.
⑥   Mix A4 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A5.
⑦   Mix A5 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A6.
⑧   Mix A6 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A7.
⑨   Mix A7 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A8.
⑩   Mix A8 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A9.
⑪   Mix A9 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A10.
⑫   Mix A10 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into A11.
⑬   Mix A11 by pipetting up and down 3x and transfer 100 μl into liquid waste.
⑭   Take care not to continue serial dilution into column 12.
⑮   Repeat dilution series for rows B, C, D.
⑯   Measure fluorescence of all samples in all standard measurement modes in instrument.

Cell growth:
More details
①    Pick 2 colonies from each of plate and inoculate each in 5-10 mL LB medium + Chloramphenicol (For antibiotic concentrations, please follow these guidelines: http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Antibiotic_Stocks).
②   Grow the cells overnight (16-18 hours) at 37°C and 220 rpm.
③   With 8 total devices (including controls) and 2 colonies per device, you should have 16 cultures.
Cell growth, sampling, and assay
More details
①   Set your instrument to read Abs600 (as OD calibration setting)
②   Measure Abs600 of the overnight cultures
③ Dilute the cultures to a target Abs600 of 0.02 (see the volume of preloading culture and media in Excel Dilution Calculation sheets) in 12 ml LB medium + Chloramphenicol in 50 mL falcon tube.
④   Remove 500uL of each culture for your zero time point and hold these samples on ice. (You should have 16 sample tubes from the time=0 time point)
⑤   Incubate the cultures at 37°C and 220 rpm.
⑥   Remove 500uL samples of each culture after 2, 4 and 6 hours of growth. Keep samples on ice while completing the additional time points. You should have 16 sample tubes for each time point.
⑦   Set up your four measurement plates: For colony #1 culture, pipet 100 uL samples into wells A, B, C and D of the row for that device. For colony #2, pipet 100uL samples into wells E, F, G, and H of the row for that device.
⑧   Read your plates, taking care to use the exact same settings used for your fluorescein measurement.

Final scaling level determined from medium-high points likely to be less impacted by saturation or pipetting error.
If needed, you can shift which points are used, but it is likely better to correct instrument settings and protocol.
