「Part collection」
This year, we focus on constructing a smart system--only when the concentration of the lanthanide ions in the environment reaches the threshold, it reacts. Thus, well-characterized parts are important in our toolkit and very essential to our system.
To support our project, we construct 2 systems’ circuits--recycling circuit and sensing circuit, which well support our project and are validly characterized and documented under our efforts. We submitted 14 parts totally to the Registry.
Sincerely, we hope these parts can contribute to the Registry and light up the future of synthetic biology creation.

With the help of this collection, our bacterial could sense the lanthanide ions, then active the recycling system, express the LBT to capture those lanthanide ions.
What's more, we also prepare many types of LBT with different adsorption capacity which allows users have more choices.
