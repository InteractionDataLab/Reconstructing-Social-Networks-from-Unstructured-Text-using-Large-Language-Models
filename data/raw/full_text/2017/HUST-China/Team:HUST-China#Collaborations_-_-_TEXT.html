HUST-Cheering
NCTU iGEM conference
HUST-Cheering! Conference the 2nd!
Three universities in Wuhan, HUST-China, WHU-China and HZAU-China, always keep in touch and have collaborations. They suggested us that we can find a more suitable microbial chassis instead of E.coli because it might be intolerable to so many heterologous recombinant proteins. This summer, we kept the tradition to hold a conference in July and shared ideas of synthetic biology when NCTU Formosa came to discuss with us. Moreover, we discussed about our projects and got valuable suggestions from each other. For instance, how can we recycle Tb3+ from the recycled REEBOTs? Maybe we can extract them (Tb3+) by some chemical solutions, and then purify them by replacement reaction or others.
NCTU iGEM conference
This year we also participated in iGEM Asia Pacific Conference. We shared ideas with different teams and discussed about the difficulties that we had ever met. Most importantly, we showed our project and realized its shortages during the statement. We can optimize the pmrC promoter and triple LBT by modeling and doing some orthogonal experiments. Besides, we should consider how to improve the efficiency of the sitag by designing the shape of our silica board. The suggestions given by Prof. Chen brought us a way to enhance our REEBOT system, which directly advanced our project progress.
In poster show time, some students made a possible suggestion to us that PH should be changed to denature LBTs to separate rare earth ions after the capture work. One teacher from SCUT questioned whether our oprf-3 * LBT can express the membrane surface successfully. She thought that the over-length of oprf-3 * LBT may not meet our own requirements.
In the presentation section. We got many questions from other teams. Most of the questions are about our capture part, including how many times the silicon net can be used, how to get the bacteria from the silicon net after the bacteria is captured, and so on. Afterwards we mentioned the use of silicon net in the group meeting, and eventually we think that the use of silicon board makes it easier for our bacteria to collect.
