BBa_K2336026
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT1-GS-LBT1-GS-LBT1
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT1, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336027
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT3-GS-LBT3-GS-LBT3
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT3, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336028
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT4-GS-LBT4-GS-LBT4
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT4, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336029
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT6-GS-LBT6-GS-LBT6
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT6, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336030
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT7-GS-LBT7-GS-LBT7
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT7, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336031
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT8-GS-LBT8-GS-LBT8
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT8, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336032
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT10-GS-LBT10-GS-LBT10
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT10, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336033
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT11-GS-LBT11-GS-LBT11
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT11, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336034
oprF-GS-FLAG-LBT12-GS-LBT12-GS-LBT12
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, LBT12, a lanthanide-binding tag can capture lanthanide ions around the bacteria.
BBa_K2336035
oprF-GS-Sitag-FLAG
The OprF protein can act as an anchored protein on E.coli’s surface, with which, Sitag can help the bacteria be recycled by binding with a silicon board.
BBa_K2336036
PmrC-GFP
PmrC promoter can be activated by phosphorylated PmrA.
Those binding tags are highly effective and specific (see part page for experiment result). Different types of them allow users to customize their own combination.
We have improved our Sitag-part. Two years ago, we used it in yeast. Now we put gene into E.coli, while we have optimized its codons. Next we will do experiment to test its binding ability. We hope it will have the effect as we expected.
