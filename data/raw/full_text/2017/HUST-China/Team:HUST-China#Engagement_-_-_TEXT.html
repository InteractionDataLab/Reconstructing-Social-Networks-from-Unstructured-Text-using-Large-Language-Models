Effort on the publicity of
iGEM and synthetic biology
Interaction with high school students
By working with high school students, we can arouse their interest about synthetic biology and let them get to know more about iGEM. We would like to share our feelings of being an iGEMer. We made some experiment arrangements and guided them to do some basic experiments.
Effort on the publicity of iGEM and synthetic biology
At the beginning of our project, we found that people knew little about synthetic biology.  We hope to grasp every opportunity to introduce the concept of synthetic biology to the public. Therefore, we signed up a scientific research innovation competition held by Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
During the competition, we spread out the idea of our project, knowledge about synthetic technology and iGEM competition by presentation and posters. Our project was widely appreciated by judges and other competitors. So eventually we won the gold Prize.
It is surprising for us to find out those students and teachers who were interested in scientific research and have never heard about synthetic biology before. During the contest, we got the opportunity to introduce the basic ideas of synthetic biology to teachers and students, especially the concept of future biology engineering. This is our first step in the promotion of synthetic biology. We hope that in the future more and more people will be attracted and make further development in synthetic biology research.
All in all, we were having a busy summer. In the future, we aim at expanding the collaboration region and diversifying the cooperation content, such as helping high school teams with their projects.
