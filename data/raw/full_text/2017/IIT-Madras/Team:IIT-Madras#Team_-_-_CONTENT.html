Our Co-Team Leader, Gopi as we all affectionately call him, is not new to iGEM. He is as polite as he is kind. Gopi is a self-proclaimed insomniac and spends his nights doing sketches. He can be seen with a peacock feather on his head and a flute in his hand at random times of the day (Just like our writer got inspired here). 
Calm and composed, he always does stuff after a thorough investigation of all possible outcomes. “Fueled by BIRIYANI and PAROTTAS.&quot;

<SPAN style="display: inline-block; text-align: justify;">
One of the friendliest persons that you’ll ever meet in the institute, his single mantra to lead a simple life: Put Peace. Sometimes he puts so much peace that he starts mugging (read studying) only from 6am for an 8am quiz. One simple way of offending him is to say something bad about Bangalore. 
Called the Team Leader with respect, he is an expert at coding and can learn literally anything in one single day.  He doesn’t wish to depend on others and aims to stand on his own legs in his own farm.

When you’re so innocent that nobody doubts you even after visiting Guwahati and Goa. Having allegedly published his own research paper at such an young age, this born prodigy is also an alleged nobel laureate. Not to mention the fact, that Professors from Russia allegedly come all the way to Guwahati just to take him as an intern. His intern atrocities are worth lending your ears to.

The feminine reincarnation of Kumbhakarna [1],  and has not one, but two soulmates: food and sleep. Can fall asleep at any given time of the day and is being studied for mutations in genes involved in circadian rhythm. The food is hypothesized to fuel her intuition and hence she is full of ideas. Her human touch has helped the team and the project be more ‘human’. Fondly known among the team for getting delicious Bakarwadi and homemade food from Pune, and  giving free life fundaes late in the night.

[1] Kumbhakarna is a hulk-sized character from Indian mythology, known to sleep continuously for 6 months a year and eat for the remaining 6.

The Dark Knight of the lab and our batch, his batsuit is a sweater in all seasons and Where’s Waldo socks (take that, mosquitoes!) Quiet, brilliant, the man is an expert in manga, anime and a range of pop culture. From the awesome Spotify playlist to his touted hard drive, he’s cool, man. Let's take a moment to remember he also finds the time to kill it (us) with the acads. His only weakness is milk, which is his one true love.

Senior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
<SPAN style="display: inline-block; text-align: justify;">
You’re probably  figuring out how to pronounce his name, he is Vinayak Narendra Moorthy.  Don’t ask him why he doesn’t separate the words, you’d rather watch some cat videos.  People in the team think he doesn’t speak much but his friends outside  say ‘Don’t let the volcano erupt! It’s better that he speaks less!’ 
More than academics one can discuss a lot about tv series with him.  A friendly, humorous, lazy, facebook-addict, who doesn’t say no when someone calls for eating Biriyani (prefers parcels though), Lazy max!!
