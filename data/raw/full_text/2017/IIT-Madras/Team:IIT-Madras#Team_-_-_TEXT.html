Aditya Jeevannavar (Eggsy)
Sophomore Undergrad, Biological Sciences
The punniest guy in the group irritating at times but mostly amusing, his curly hair, dimple chins and rosy lips have driven people crazy. An enthusiastic quizzer, plays basketball and uses lame puns in his free time. He is known for his insightful ideas and his aversion to computational biology.
Gopinath Shanmugam (Gopi 65)
Senior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
Our Co-Team Leader, Gopi as we all affectionately call him, is not new to iGEM. He is as polite as he is kind. Gopi is a self-proclaimed insomniac and spends his nights doing sketches. He can be seen with a peacock feather on his head and a flute in his hand at random times of the day (Just like our writer got inspired here).  Calm and composed, he always does stuff after a thorough investigation of all possible outcomes. “Fueled by BIRIYANI and PAROTTAS." Read more about him on his Wikipedia page
Kailash BP (Nalla thambi)
Junior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
Lord commander of the data watch. Was given the title Nalla Thambi(Tamil: good little brother) for sincerity and addressing seniors as Anna(Tamil: big brother). Hails from Chennai, goes home once a fortnight and returns with homemade food! Fluent in many languages including English, Tamil, Telugu, C, Perl, and Python. As a side project in a parallel universe he is working on turning himself  into Pickle Rick.
Karthik D (KD)
Senior Undergrad, Biological Sciences
One of the friendliest persons that you’ll ever meet in the institute, his single mantra to lead a simple life: Put Peace. Sometimes he puts so much peace that he starts mugging (read studying) only from 6am for an 8am quiz. One simple way of offending him is to say something bad about Bangalore.  Called the Team Leader with respect, he is an expert at coding and can learn literally anything in one single day.  He doesn’t wish to depend on others and aims to stand on his own legs in his own farm.
DVSSS Kushal Kumar Reddy (Yellow Pages)
Sophormore Undergrad, Biological Sciences
Digavinti Venkat Shiva Satya Sai Kushal Kumar Reddy is a super stud who has successfully managed 10 Positions Of Responsibility without breaking a sweat. Known for his infinite contacts all over the world, he is fondly called Yellow Pages. He’s an unpaid guest at his own house, one who uses it for bed, bath, and nothing beyond.  In addition to all these superpowers, he has got one more to his bag: Multilingualism.
Mayur Chhoriya (Toofan)
Junior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
When you’re so innocent that nobody doubts you even after visiting Guwahati and Goa. Having allegedly published his own research paper at such an young age, this born prodigy is also an alleged nobel laureate. Not to mention the fact, that Professors from Russia allegedly come all the way to Guwahati just to take him as an intern. His intern atrocities are worth lending your ears to.
Mohammed Faidh (Loveguru)
Sophomore Undergrad, Biological Sciences
Mizaan is known for making witty and waggish remarks  at the right times. He is a gregarious person and is fun to be around. He is a huge bibliophile and at any random time of the day he can be spotted with a novel novel (yes, you read that twice) in his hand. His love for organic chemistry runs deep and he makes subtle puns on it. A self acclaimed Mysore Pak supplier. He is an animal lover (especially cats) and is passionate about photography and could be spotted with his DSLR during his leisure time.
Mousami Shinde (Mouse)
Junior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
The feminine reincarnation of Kumbhakarna [1],  and has not one, but two soulmates: food and sleep. Can fall asleep at any given time of the day and is being studied for mutations in genes involved in circadian rhythm. The food is hypothesized to fuel her intuition and hence she is full of ideas. Her human touch has helped the team and the project be more ‘human’. Fondly known among the team for getting delicious Bakarwadi and homemade food from Pune, and  giving free life fundaes late in the night.
[1] Kumbhakarna is a hulk-sized character from Indian mythology, known to sleep continuously for 6 months a year and eat for the remaining 6.
Nikhita Damaraju (Jinx)
Junior Undergrad, Biological Sciences
Nikhita, the second of the iGEM Damarajus, the Multitasker, the Queen of Code, the Mother of Codons, the Breaker of Plasmids, Descendant of the RFP transformers, the Unslept, the Madrasi of the Great Grand Forest, and the Laaaaaaameeeeeee. A huge fan of Carnatic Music and loves playing Violin.
Ramya Vijayram (Maami)
Junior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
Has the unique ability to diss out cut-throat replies on demand. Will go on random monologues at times (she’s a thespian) that delve deep into life’s deepest darkest secrets. A successful stage artist and director.  One of the many reasons we call her Maami (aunt) is due to the fact that she is a teetotaller and drinks tea like water.
Shreyansh Umale (Otaku)
Junior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
The Dark Knight of the lab and our batch, his batsuit is a sweater in all seasons and Where’s Waldo socks (take that, mosquitoes!) Quiet, brilliant, the man is an expert in manga, anime and a range of pop culture. From the awesome Spotify playlist to his touted hard drive, he’s cool, man. Let's take a moment to remember he also finds the time to kill it (us) with the acads. His only weakness is milk, which is his one true love.
Srinath Muralidharan (Mylapore Beach)
Sophomore Undergrad, Biological Engineering
Srinath is a man of choice, for he chose to stay in institute hostels although his home is nearby. On any random day, he can be seen in the rooms of random classmates trying hard to convince how the courses are easy, while he studies away at his home over the weekends. An ardent fan of memes, and is very much responsible for upholding the team integrity by tagging the whole team in memes.
Vinayaknarendramoorthy (Biriyani)
Senior Undergrad, Biological Engineering
You’re probably  figuring out how to pronounce his name, he is Vinayak Narendra Moorthy.  Don’t ask him why he doesn’t separate the words, you’d rather watch some cat videos.  People in the team think he doesn’t speak much but his friends outside  say ‘Don’t let the volcano erupt! It’s better that he speaks less!’  More than academics one can discuss a lot about tv series with him.  A friendly, humorous, lazy, facebook-addict, who doesn’t say no when someone calls for eating Biriyani (prefers parcels though), Lazy max!!
