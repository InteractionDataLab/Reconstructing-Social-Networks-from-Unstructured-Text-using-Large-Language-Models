ChassiDex
A database for host organisms
Is E. coli enough for all our synthetic biology needs?
We thought so too, until we saw how some synthetic biologists are using alternate host organisms; alternates that are unique and irreplacable.
In other words, we require the right host for the right task.
So you've found the right host for your idea.
But you've never used it before!
How do you get started?
Fret not! Weâ€™ve got you covered!
How, you ask?
We've developed ChassiDex, an online resource that will help synthetic biologists get started with unconventional host organisms. At the core of the project is a database of host organisms and related information. The resource also includes host specific software tools and a manual listing guidelines to help start with new host organisms.
