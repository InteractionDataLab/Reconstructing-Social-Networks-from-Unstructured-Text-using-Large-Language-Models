Comment
Part Collection
To achieve our goal, TNCR_Korea wanted to incorporate DPP4 gene. However, DPP4 may trigger the inflammation response in case. Therefore, we needed to control its expression. TNCR_Korea team adapted the previous BioBrick Parts, named Anderson promoter (BBa_J23110, BBa_J23111, BBa_J23116), then designed three composite plasmids (strong BBa_K2496002, moderate BBa_K2496006, weak BBa_K2496007). Basically, DPP4 was inserted with Flag molecular tag for easy detection of its incorporation by checking tag’s expression (DPP4 BBa_K2496001 and Flag BBa_K2496000). There are two Pst1 sites in the DPP4 sequence, so it is not possible to access the desired 3A assembly method from iGEM. So we used infusion ligation method instead. Consequently, TNCR_Korea constituted recombinant plasmid which has Anderson promoter, DPP4, and Flag. The Range of Part Numbers are, 1) Best New Basic part: BBa_K2496000 (Flag) BBa_K2496001 (DPP4), 2) Best New composite part: BBa_K2496002 (strong), BBa_K2496006 (moderate), BBa_K2496007 (weak), 3) Best part collection ranged from BBa_K2496000 to BBa_K2496007.
