Motivation
Celiac disease is a serious autoimmune disorder that is mainly caused by gluten, which is composed of gliadorphins. Among gliadorphin, amino acid called proline is abundant. This proline causes inflammation in intestinal immunocyte, triggering it to attack absorptive cells and damage small intestine.
