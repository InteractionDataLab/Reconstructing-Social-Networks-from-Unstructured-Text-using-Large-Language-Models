NCTU_Formosa: Team Introduction
Team Introduction
     We are NCTU_Formosa iGEM team. Our team consists of 16 students with a diversity of major departments in National Chiao-Tung University, including the department of Biological Science and Technology, Material                 Science and Engineering, Nano Science and Engineering as well as Electronics Engineering. Each of us made good use of our specialized knowledge, we shared opinion and did brainstorming together, and gain new multifaceted abilities during                 these days. NCTU_Formosa! Go! Fight! And Win our glory!!
Team Leader
I’m Francis, the team leader of 2017 NCTU_Formosa and a student majoring in Material Science and Engineering. From a childish kid who didn’t even hear of iGEM to the leader of NCTU_Formosa, I learned lots of things. Learning technical                     skills for experiments, sharing our ideas, and making plenty of friends with different countries and cultures will all be my treasurable memories. Thanks to everybody who have helped me on our road to Boston. See you soon in the Giant                     Jamboree!
