NCTU_Formosa: Collaborations
Collaboration
The New iGEM team- TCFSH
     Since April 14th, NCTU_Formosa started to introduce experiments which are related to iGEM to the science-gifted class of Taichung First Senior High School(TCFSH). Gradually, the background knowledge of synthetic biology was adequate, then the cogitation of combination to engineering and biology was shared, the core of the gene regulation, the design of biobricks was taught. Also, we introduce previous projects from NCTU_Formosa, hope to give them the prospect of the competition.
     In the last semester, the instructor of NCTU_Formosa, Pro. Wen-Liang Chen invited the gifted students from TCFSH who decided to learn about biology to our lab. NCTU_Formosa then gave them a series of training, the SOP of                 our wet lab protocol, which includes:
- Cultivation of E. Coli
- Miniprep
- Digestion
- Ligation
- Transformation
- PCR
- Gel Electrophoresis

     These are basic experimental skills for people who study biology and so as every iGEMers. Especially for the digestion part, while it is one of the most important parts for iGEMers, we also taught them about the concept of biobrick assembly, the design of EXSP, different kinds of parts of biobrick… and so on.
     And in this summer, we were glad to know that some TCFSH students decided to participate iGEM, new iGEMers were born. There are more things that a new team need to know, more knowledge to learn. NCTU_Formosa members taught                 them more about :
- Useful databases, such as NCBI, Uniport
- Useful tools for protein, such as BLAST, COBALT, CD search
- Biology experiment design and debug
- Writing Biobricks for synthesis (in sequences)

     We hope they could get more information in a short time and see the power of bioinformatics, it’s also a concept of our project. Some of our members spent days with these high school students discussing their ideas and helped them to design experiments to realize their ideas. Later, they finally came out with their own biobrick sequences.
     Through practicing and discussion, they completed many experiments on their own, including purification of plasmids, digestion with restriction enzyme, and conducting gel electrophoresis. They even came up with more outstanding thoughts about the project they’ve schematized this year. We are looking forward to the great shine of the team in Boston this year and get valuable experiences

The Bidirectional Cooperation with TCFSH_Taiwan
Web Lab
     After learning the experiments, the team members of TCFSH_Taiwan helped us to do the double check on the correctness of our composite parts. They took our sample and ran the Taq PCR and also ensured the band of each composite parts was correct via gel electrophoresis.

Figure 5: The result of gel electrophoresis is shown in the picture
Table 1: After comparing to the marker, they got the band sizes and double confirmed our composite parts
     After comparison to the marker, they got the band size and did the double confirmation for our composite parts.
Dry Lab
     Also, the team members of TCFSH_Taiwan assisted us to set up the demonstration of IoTtalk, the plant box. After the IoT camp in the summer, They had enough background knowledge to implement the operation. The linking between hardware and our IoT platform worked well with the help of TCFSH_Taiwan.
Figure 6: Our team member, MING JIE GUO, was introducing the design of the plant box
Figure 7: The team members of TCFSH_Taiwan,  BO CHING, WU and  CHIEN-YI, CHIEN, was helping us setting up the hardware devices and testing the sensitivity of sensors

Corridor, a Platform for the iGEMers, Established by SZU-China
     We were glad to get the invitation from SZU China and be a member of Corridor. It is a platform that tries to provide a community for iGEMers to ask the question about synthetic biology and make the discussion. We hoped that in the future, Corridor can be a communication center to gather wisdom to spread the concept of synthetic biology around the world and the name of iGEM to be far-famed. Furthermore, we also asked SZU China to try out our Parabase.
