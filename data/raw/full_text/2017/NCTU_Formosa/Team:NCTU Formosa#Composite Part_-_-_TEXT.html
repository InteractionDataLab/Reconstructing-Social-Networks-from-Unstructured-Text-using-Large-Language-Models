NCTI_Formosa: Composite Parts
Composite Part
     Knowing that fungi will be affected by these peptides and they may not hurt E. coli, we tried to express them through bacteria E. coli BL21 Rosetta-gami strain, which can do well in making multiple disulfide bonds. To get more             peptide, we used the T7 promoter, a strong expression promoter, to enhance the production.
