     Prof. CHEN, WEN-LIANG helped us to build up the ability of experimental techniques and guide us to the field of synthetic biology.
     Prof. Lee, HSIAO-CHING gave us helpful suggestions to build up our biobricks, and taught us the concept of iGEM.
     Prof. HUANG, HSIEN-DA, and Prof. HO, HSING-YING taught us the logic of coding, and gave us plenty of suggestions to the dry lab.
     Prof. LIN,YI-PING provided us the technique of IoTtalk, the platform of IoT system. Additionally, he also taught us how to link up our model and prediction with the whole system.
