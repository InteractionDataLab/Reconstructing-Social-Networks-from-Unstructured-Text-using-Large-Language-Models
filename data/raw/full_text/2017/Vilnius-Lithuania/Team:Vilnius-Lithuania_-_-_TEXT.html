Present Challenges of
Experimenting With Plasmid Systems
1. 1.
Plasmid Replication
Origin of replication (Ori) is a sequence where the plasmid replication begins. Plasmids with similar Ori sites use the same replication machinery.
Problem #1
1. 2.
Unbalanced Replication
Replication machinery does not discriminate between similar Ori sites, therefore smaller plasmids are replicated faster and rapidly outgrow larger plasmids, which leads to uneven plasmid ratios in a cell.
Problem #1
1. 3.
Plasmid Loss
This is even more likely to occur when some plasmids are low copy number. When the cell                             divides, low copy plasmids tend to be lost in next generations.
Problem #1
2. 1.
Plasmid Incompatibility
This inability to stably co-maintain different plasmids over a number of generations in the same bacterial cell line is called plasmid incompatibility. One needs to use different types of Ori to avoid this trouble.
Problem #2
2. 2.
Plasmid Incompatibility
However, it often causes trouble due to limited Ori selection options or the lack of good combination of Ori and plasmid's copy number. Imagine you require a system consisting of two - low and high copy number  plasmids. Try picking them from the list.
Problem #2
2. 3.
Fixed Copy Number
Currently no handy method of changing the copy number of particular plasmid exists. It must be either low, or medium, or high.
Problem #2
2. 4.
Deficient Responsivity
There is also no mechanism to adjust the copy number when so is required in any specific                             situation, for example: incoming cellular signals or special patterns.
Problem #2
Success!
Error!
As you can see from our example, even when one knows what copy number is needed for system, it is hard to find the right combination of compatible replicons and right copy number.
Plasmids are incompatible, because they use the same replicons.

We think it is time for a change.
