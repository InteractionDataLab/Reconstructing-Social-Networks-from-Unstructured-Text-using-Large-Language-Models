Part Collection
We have created a large and extensive part collection in which each piece has a different specific function, however they all consolidate for a common purpose of creating a flexible and precise multi-plasmid system. The core of this collection consists of modified plasmid replication initiation devices, where each one represents a different plasmid group, all of which can be placed together in a cell. Next, modified replication regulation devices allow adjusting copy number in constitutive and inducible manner or virtually any signal pattern. These regulators specifically interact with initiation devices of each plasmid group by using specific recognition sequences allowing a group-dependent control. Additionally, global copy number control device allows regulating all groups at once. Active partitioning device, which ensures stable specific plasmid group inheritance can be used for low copy number plasmids. This collection is concluded with synthetic selection system providing a biosafe method to selectively grow cells with different plasmid groups using only one antibiotic resistance gene. Each piece of this collection has a different function, yet they consolidate for a common purpose of creating a flexible and precise plasmid system.
