Our Solution: the SynORI Framework
1. 1.
Plasmid Groups
Multi-plasmid framework would not be much without multiple plasmids. The synthetic origin of replication allows to co-maintain different unique plasmid groups in a single cell.
1. 2.
Copy Number Control
With the SynORI system you can adjust your plasmids' copy number in constitutive and inducible manner or virtually any signal pattern.
1. 3.
Adjusting Copy Number
With the SynORI we introduce the world’s first inducible precise copy number plasmids. You may choose any particular plasmid to be low or high copy number.
1. 4.
Rop
Would you like to globally control your plasmid groups’ copy number, we have optimized the effects of Rop protein. By inducing the expression of Rop you can lower the copy number of all plasmid groups universally.
1. 5.
Selection System
Five different plasmids equals to five different antibiotics for external selection? Not anymore. SynORI contains a five-part self-assembling selection system which uses only one antibiotic resistance gene.
1. 6.
Segregation System
SynORI also contains an active partitioning device, which ensures stable specific plasmid group inheritance and can be used for low copy number plasmids.
