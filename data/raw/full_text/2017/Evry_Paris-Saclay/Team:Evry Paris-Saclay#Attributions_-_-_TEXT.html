The 2017 iGEM Evry Paris-Saclay team was composed by master and bachelor students of Paris-Saclay University, but the project would not have been possible without the help of many people whom we wanted to thank.
HOST INSTITUTIONS:
The institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology (iSSB), part of UMR8030 Genomics Metabolics managed by Marcel Salanoubat hosted us and allowed us access to the abSYNTH plateform of Genopole managed by Joan Herrisson. We want to thank researchers and PhD student for their kindness and accessibility, and also for their help when we needed it and especially to Sylvie Bobelet and Bernadette Lauret who support us since the beginning of the competition.
Pr Jean-loup Faulon gently allowed us to perform most of our experiments in his lab and helped us with the funding.
FUNDING:
Genopole, with the help of Emmanuel Desquier, and the University of Paris Saclay provided for the main financial support.
University of Evry-val-d'Essonne, Grand Paris Sud and the Embassy of France in the United States for their financial support.
EXTERNAL ADVICE:
Anne Zaparucha for her help and advice on the structural modelling.
Charbel Maroun for his review of the modeling report.
Cyrille Pauthenier and Clément de Obaldia for their support and precious tips and tricks.
Laurent Jannière and Brian Jester for their advice on the project construction.
Alain Fournier for his advices on the bioscreening system.
Bastien Roux from the French Federation of Diabetic who helped us on the choice of the Psicose among other sugars thanks to its expertise on diabetes.
A special thank to Ioana Popescu, who has been there at every step of the project (Sciences and Human Practices), more than a supervisor she provided help and emotional support to us. The success of this project is largely due to her.
We also want to thank our supervisors Bruno Colombo, and our advisors, Amir Pandi & Matthieu Da Costa, who were there from the first brainstorming to the birth of the project and its realisation, who followed us through this adventure, advised and helped us to build the project.
We received instructions for lab safety and security from Dominique Zeliszewski (CR1, CNRS) and Noemie Brisemeur (iSSB)
Distribution of the tasks
Rose Berthomé naturally took the lead of the team. With kindness and soft power, she managed to coordinate every pole of the team to build a homogenous project. She also lead the public relations, helped to manage the wetlab, took care of all the administrative tasks, especially the accounts management and the many orders we did. Our project wouldn’t be what it is without her.
Sciences:
Jérémy Armetta was the head of Sciences. He directed every aspects of the scientific project, from the theoretical design (bibliography, constructions) and the experimental strategy (workflow, primers, strains…), the management of the experiments (planning, coordination of the team members, etc…) and the management of the wetlab (set up, protocols writing and optimization, stocks). He also actively managed the sponsoring and interacted with potential partners.
1. Biology
Team Members:
Antonin Cros in charge of the bio-production project, from design to experiments including enzyme characterization, Psicose production, and mutant library. He also wrote a report on bio-production techniques for the HP.
Vincent Gureghian in charge of modelling. He did the virtual screening. He started the team, taking charge of the administration and the research of sponsors with Julie Le Hoang. He also participated in the creation of the Biolab and the organization of the different social events.
Jason Leonard worked in the wetlab, especially on the biosensor project, and wrote the request for food additive assessment to the European Food Safety Authority. He was also the official translator of the team.
Interns:
Paul Del Rincon took in charge the Interlab and helped in the experimental work on both the biosensor and bio-production parts.
Céline Pophillat who assisted Antonin for the bio-production project and helped with the experiments.
Inès Ajel, Sambavi Markandu, Anna Farooqui & Cornelia Yacko who assisted us in the lab during the summer.
Helpers:
Aboudrahamane Bate, Garry Duville, Zaahith Adboulatif , Schérazade Rami & Esther Lutete for their help when we were understaffed.
Rania Bouzgarrou who calibrated the HPLC and explained the whole process, training the members.
2. Chemistry
Hichem Maslah lead the chemistry part and wrote a report on the chemical production of Psicose. He designed the chemistry project, researched the bibliography on Psicose, the production by epimerization and enantioselective synthesis, Implementation of the synthesis and characterization of the reaction products by NMR. But also the implementation of an HPLC analysis method: bibliography on the different techniques of HPLC, choice of the column and parameters of the run. He introduced the team to Sanofi.
Morane Beaumet wrote a report on current sweetener of interest and participated in the elaboration of the chemistry project.
They both worked on the synthesis of the Psicose by epimerization.
Human Practices:
Yanis Khenniche was the Head of the Human Practices and Education & Public Engagement. Throughout the year, he coordinated the HP team to provide the best applications possible according to the project, launching initiatives in economics, social and ethics that were pertinent. He designed the presentations but also the poster and the logo for communication. Assuming Education & Public Engagement, we organized the interviews with our collaborators and the interventions in high schools as well as the event around science communication. At the interface between Biology and HP, we managed to present the project towards collaborators and represented the team at the CNVSA contest around science communication.
Cylia Bouchachi along with Yanis creating the BioLab project and searched for sponsors, she also participated in the wetlab biosensor project.
Maxime De la Fouchardière was in charged of the law part of the project and redacted the entire legal investigation on our project but also helped us with different collaborations with iGEM Aix Marseille and iGEM UPMC. He was also helped by Dyvia Moselle & Illyana Debilli for the legal investigation.
Giovanna Pinaud wrote a report on the danger of sugar and the history of bio-production.
Communication:
Oussoufa Hassani and Mohamed Guerbi for their amazing work, all the videos and pictures documenting our iGEM adventure. Oussoufa Hassani set up the communication strategy (writing, shooting and editing of promotional videos and pictures.
Yanis Khenniche, Vincent Gureghian, Antonin Cros and Anthony Gêne who were in charged of the social media (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn).
Olivier Guillment and Thomas Croissant for the promotional video on Psicose.
Yassine Fernane who created and designed our website.
