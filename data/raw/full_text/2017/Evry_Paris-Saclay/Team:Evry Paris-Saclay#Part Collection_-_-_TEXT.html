Part Collection
The Universal Biosensing Collection groups constructs derived from the Universal Biosensing Chassis (UBC) ( BBa_K2448023 or BBa_K2448024 ). This UBC can be used to easily create biosensors able to sense and quantify virtually any compound by direct or indirect sensing. Designed for high throughput screening, thanks to Golden Gate Assembly, standardized fusion sites and insertion markers, it enables the characterization of many parts at once, coupled with a Fluorescence plate reader or Flow Cytometer. For instance we constructed, based on this UBC, different highly specific biosensors: a fructose biosensor and several psicose biosensors, each of them with a particular dynamic range and sensitivity. This collection could be the first step in a larger repository composed of standardized biosensors for a large number of molecules.
During this project, our team designed the first 8 members of the Universal Biosensing Collection:
