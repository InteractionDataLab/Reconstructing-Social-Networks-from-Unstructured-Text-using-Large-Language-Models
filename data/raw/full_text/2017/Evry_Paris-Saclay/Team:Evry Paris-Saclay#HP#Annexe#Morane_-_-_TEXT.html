Sugar Substitutes
The cited sweeteners are amongst the most commonly found on the French market (the list is therefore non-exhaustive).
Their benefits are manifolds, some help with the decrease of calories intake; others are used for being neither carcinogenic nor detrimental for people suffering from diabetes. Moreover, sugar substitutes can effectively find applications in multiple fields thanks to their differing properties: whilst some can resist high temperatures, others become toxic or degrade under the same conditions.
None of these substitutes are forbidden in France, but most can have side effects such as, for a high number of substitutes, disturbing the digestion process, and acting as laxative. Such nuisance are usually observed after high consumption of the sweetener (that sometimes are unattainable owing to their sweetening capacity, which would be similar to consuming 1 kg of normal sugar per day). Furthermore, part of those sweeteners have also been suspected of causing issues relating to reproductions, on reproductive systems, or on the foetus...).
