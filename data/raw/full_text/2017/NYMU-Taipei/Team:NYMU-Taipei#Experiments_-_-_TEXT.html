Nitrogen Starvation
Culture Chlorella vulgaris
How long would it grow ?
7 days (theoretically)
reach stationary phase at the fourth day (theoretically)
How to cultivate it ?
Activate the algae in 15cc BG11(no need to unfreeze, keep it at the original took-out temperature) at 28°C~30°C
Illumination at 10000~12000 lumen
How to regenerate it ?
Each regenerate ’s plate put in 1500 microliter fully developed algae and 15cc BG11 (refill BG11 into the original plate)
make sure the plate maintain in the needed amount
regenerate every 7days
What we should do in these 7 days ?
Experiment about nitrogen starvation
Measurement about the yield of oil in the algae
Time guideline of nitrogen starvation experiment
Day 1
Cultivate the algae and start doing the OD measurement every 6 hours (detailed protocol)
Day 2
PCR , cloning and ligation (detailed protocol)
Transformation and selection (detailed protocol)
Day 3
Colony PCR and RE check (detailed protocol)
DNA storage (detailed protocol)
Day 4
Take some E.coli and ensure it could process nitrogen starvation by using kit
Day 5
choose the successfully transformed e.coli and put it into the algae plate(when it reach its max od value) (detailed protocol)
Start doing the measurement about oil production every 12 hours until you have at least 6 data (detailed protocol)
Day 6
Keep on going the measurement
Day 7
Keep on going the measurement
Regenerate the algae
Day 8
Back to day 1
*** this experiment group should have at least 4 routines *** those who incharge in the experiment should have wrote down the time and date *** once you have an extremely success-transformed E.coli, congratulate, you have your own free time in day 2 and day 3, but make sure you have done you liquid culture cultivation of e.coli so that you can continue your experiment at day 4
