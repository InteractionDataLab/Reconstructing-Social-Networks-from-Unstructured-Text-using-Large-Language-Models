Applied Design
Our project, Smart AlgaEnergy, aims to improve biofuel production through artificial photosynthesis and nitrogen starvation in closed and open ponds. There are several designs we show promise to the application:
Genetically modified cyanobacteria: Companies can use large ponds or closed systems to harvest biofuel simply by growing these more efficient microalgae.     (See more detail: Pigments - Conclusion )
Monitoring device for nitrogen starvation: Growers in open pond can use our device to instantly monitor algae growth and use our genetically modified E. coli for nitrogen starvation accordingly.     (See more detail: Device )
Environmentally friendly: We have successfully included suicide mechanism in our nitrogen starvation E. coli, by adding lactose to the pond, the E. coli can be lysed.     (See more detail: Nitrogen Starvation )
Valuable pigment side product: Our genetically modified cyanobacteria can also be used to produce valuable pigments like zeaxanthin.     (See more detail: Pigments - Zeaxanthin, Lycopene )
