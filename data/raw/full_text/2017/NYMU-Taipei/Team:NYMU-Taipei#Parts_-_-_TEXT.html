Our part collection included basic parts and composite parts. We focused on two aspects, one, nitrogen affinity protein for nitrogen starvation and two, pigment production in cyanobacteria. These two approaches were aimed to produce more energy from microalgae by nitrogen starvation and artificial photosynthesis. We also implemented suicide mechanism by combining holin and endolysin with nitrogen affinity protein in one construct for issues regarding biosafety. We successfully proved the function of nitrogen affinity protein, suicide mechanism and yellow pigment production in E. coli and cyanobacteria. We also set up a transformation platform for cyanobacteria with these new transformation parts and protocols. In conclusion, we proved our concept by this part collection from BBa_K2350000 to BBa_K2350025.
