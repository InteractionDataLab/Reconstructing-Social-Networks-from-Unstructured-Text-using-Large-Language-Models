We taught them the principle of Fusion PCR while sharing our experience and reminding them of some precautions of running Fusion PCR. On the other hand, they helped us characterize our <B style="color:#ff7575;">suicide mechanism</B> and sent us <B style="color:#ff7575;">the functional test results.</B></P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Chung Shan Medical University (CSMU NCHU Taiwan)-Team Establishment</H6><P>NYMU-Taipei assisted CSMU NCHU Taiwan to <B style="color:#ff7575;">establish their iGEM team</B>. We gave them advice about how to form a successful iGEM team and gave them a brief overview of the competition rules. </P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Chang Gung University (CGU Taiwan)-Education</H6><P>This year, NYMU focuses on the Energy track, and CGU Taiwan focuses on the Environment track. In August, NYMU Taipei collaborated with CGU Taiwan in <B style="color:#ff7575;">Wego Bilingual High School education</B>. Through presenting different dimension of global crisis, we believe that these kids could be more acquainted with iGEM.</P></DIV><H6>(2)	High School </H6><DIV class="introduction"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Taipei American School (TAS Taipei)-Experimental Help</H6><P>NYMU this year collaborated with TAS Taipei, and they helped us with <B style="color:#ff7575;">suicide mechanism functional test</B>. Their test results make us more certain that our suicide mechanism is reliable, so our project is without biosafety concern as well. Moreover, we also educated Taipei American School how to <B style="color:#ff7575;">conduct site-directed mutagenesis and assay biofilm production</B>, which is also a great progress to their project.</P></DIV><H6>(3)	Oversea Universities</H6><DIV class="introduction"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Team KU Leuven (Belgium)-Worldwide Collaboration Project</H6><P>We were honorably invited by KU Leuven to participate in a <B style="color:#ff7575;">worldwide iGEM translation project</B>, which is comprised of several teams worldwide to reach the consensus of making the spread of synthetic biology knowledge without the language barrier. We were responsible for Traditional Chinese translation in this project, and our team project was translated into different languages, including Russian, German, French, etc.  </P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Team Tokyo Tech (Japan) and Team KAIT Japan-Project Inspirement</H6><P>This August, we held a <B style="color:#ff7575;">modeled presentation with both Tokyo Tech and KAIT Japan</B>, and they gave us some constructive suggestions in our presentation. We also paid a visit to KAIT Japan’s lab so that we can have a deeper understanding of each other’s project. Most important of all, in 2009, Team Tokyo Tech made Melanin possible to express in Escherichia coli. As a result, they <B style="color:#ff7575;">gave us lots of useful experiment advice</B> of how to produce Melanin in Escherichia. coli, which inspired us the idea to express black pigment in our microalgae. </P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Team Peshawar (Pakistan)-Experimental Help
</H6><P>This September, we submitted the NrtA part to Team Peshawar for <B style="color:#ff7575;">examination of protein electrophoresis</B>. Their results remind us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration, so the capability of NrtA-transformant may be enhanced significantly.
</P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Team Franconia-Worldwide Collaboration Project </H6><P>We assisted Team Franconia to <B style="color:#ff7575;">translate their biological themed cards into Traditional Chinese</B>, and we all think this card game is significantly meaningful after translated into types of different languages. We hope that this game could raise people’s awareness of pathogens and biosafety issues.</P></DIV><H6>(4)	iGEMers Meetup</H6><DIV class="introduction"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Taiwan iGEM Conference</H6><P>In July, we attended the <B style="color:#ff7575;">Taiwan iGEM Conference held by CGU Taiwan</B>. This was the first iGEM conference we attended and was the first time we presented our project with other iGEM teams as well, which was a milestone for NYMU-Taipei and we all enjoyed the time spent with other Taiwan iGEM teams. </P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Asia Pacific Conference</H6><P>In August, NYMU participated in <B style="color:#ff7575;">Asia Pacific Conference held by NCTU Formosa</B>, which is one of the largest activities for Asia iGEMers. We have opportunities to meet around 25 iGEM teams from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US. After this four-day event, we learn a lot from these Asia iGEM teams and knew that we still have much room for improvement in our presentation skills and poster design.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content2"><P>Domestic team collaborations, we collaborate with Taiwan university teams. We mentor Chung Cheng University through teaching Fusion PCR. Besides, they conduct experiment to ensure our suicide mechanism. Inviting Chang Gung University during Asia Pacific Conference, we host education in Wego senior high school together. </P><H4>  	Chung Cheng University</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><P>    Last year, NYMU team helped students from National Chung Cheng University form their own iGEM team. Excitedly, they will participate iGEM competition this year as team name “CCU_Taiwan” and share their project with all iGEMers on stage in the Giant Jamboree.During the 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference and the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, we have a wonderful time discussing on each teams’ project and give each both team suggestions for further improvement. We just build strong bond with them and look forward to their results this year at Giant Jamboree!</P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Mentor about the fusion PCR</H6><P>After the team meet-up, we showed them how the Photo-Bioreactor functions, taught them how to run Fusion PCR through webcam, and inform them of team operations and matters.The following links were videos of the process of NYMU team taught CCU team how to work on Fusion PCR. It was quite interesting and educational.</P></DIV><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Assit our characterization of suicide system</H6><P>On the other hand, CCU team help us characterize Holin- Endolysin- NrtA system (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2350021">BBa_K2350021</A>), the so-called “suicide system”, and measure the growth curve of Escherichia coli DH5α, by adding lactose to induce kill-switch mechanism, in order to determine whether the system works and ensure the biosafety of our project. With their assistance, we can verify that E.coli significantly decrease in several hours, after kill-switch functioned in different lactose concentrations.</P></DIV><DIV style="width:60%;margin:auto;"><P style="font-size:18px;">Figure 1 CCU_Taiwan tested the function of our lactose-induced suicide system.

This presentation includes the introduction to synthetic biology, the process of developing, researching, and expanding on a research topic for iGEM in hopes of inspiring them to create their own team in the upcoming year. In addition to presenting our own topic and past projects of NYMU, we also collaborated with NCGU so that, through their presentation, the students would receive further insights in the understanding of how a research team and project come together. Our presenters started the event off with basic components of synthetic biology and iGEM; the NCGU iGEM team then followed up by focusing on the term “entropy” and, after a series of interactive questions with the student body, brought in their project idea of the de-inking paper. We believe that this collaboration was a success in not only the education of high school kids but also such that the two teams were able to learn more from each other.  </P></DIV><H4>	Chung Shan Medical University</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Assit a new team</H6><P>     In March 2017, thanks to the introduction of medical students in our school, we contacted the students from Chung Shan Medical University and National Chung Hsing University. These students are going to establish a joint team called “CSMU_NCHU_Taiwan”, and participate in the iGEM competition this year. They ask our teacher, Prof. Chang, and our team for some advice about forming an iGEM team, and how to integrate a project. We communicated through webcam, and we also explained and reminded them some competition rules. During the 2017 iGEM Taiwan Conference and the 5th Asia-Pacific iGEM Conference, there were great opportunities to exchange both team projects and gave practical suggestions for improvement. We highly look forward to their project and results in Giant Jamboree in November, and are honored to participate in the growth of a new team.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content3"><P>Strengthening long-standing partnership with Taipei America School, we troubleshoot each project mutually by assisting TAS with teaching cloning and constructing primer. In return, they conduct an experiment to ensure our suicide mechanism. As usual, we continue our relationship with TAS.

With help from Peshawar, we ensure our transformed E. coli can produce our target protein, NrtA protein. </P><H4>	Pakistan: Team Peshawar</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><P>     We sincerely appreciate the invitation from team Peshawar in Pakistan for team collaboration. NrtA part has been constructed by our team, and its sequence has also been determined. We submitted the part to team Peshawar for examination of protein electrophoresis in September. Team Peshawar has successfully transformed the plasmid containing NrtA gene sent by us, and the transformants were lysed and the SDS-PAGE was performed. Following are the step by step processes that team Peshawar followed to help us in confirming whether the protein is properly synthesized in the cell by running the protein on gel i.e. 45k Da.</P><P>The conclusion of our collaboration reminds us of modifying our design by taking signal peptide under consideration. In fact, we have conducted a functional test for determining the capability of NrtA with a semi-permeable membrane system. The function of NrtA protein has been proved valid but still had much to be desired. Taking signal peptide under consideration, we may transfer the protein to the plasma membrane or even to extracellular fluid. Therefore, the capability of NrtA-transformant may be enhanced significantly. The collaboration really inspired us a lot.</P></DIV><DIV id="Peshawar-pdf"><H6>Collaboration with Team Taipei-SDS</H6></DIV><H4>	IGEM Tokyo Tech</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Present our project</H6><P>           In August, one of our team members paid a visit to Tokyo Institute of Technology for the purpose of searching for team collaboration and friendship with IGEM Tokyo Tech. We sincerely appreciate the warm welcome and excellent reception from all members of IGEM Tokyo Tech. We exchanged information of our idea of IGEM, current work of our projects and future potential collaboration.We held a modeled presentation, provided a constructive suggestion for one another and tried to improve some parts of our projects that might be challenged in Jamboree. Their project this year is about constructing a new co-culturing system across bacteria, plant cells, and animal cells through the signal molecule. ,</P><H6 style="color:#886600;">Adopt advice to our project</H6><P> In 2009, team Tokyo Tech focused on the topic of Terraforming of Mars. An elaborately described method of creating blackened Escherichia coli was displayed on its wiki. After consulting IGEM Tokyo Tech and delving into their project, we intended to construct a plasmid containing Melanin sequence and further transform the plasmid into microalgae. Apart from in 2012 distribution kit was used, which was submitted by IGEM Tokyo Tech in 2009, when constructing Melanin plasmid. We sincerely appreciate the help from team Tokyo Tech for consulting and discussion.</P></DIV><H4> KAIT Japan</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Hold a modeled presentation</H6><P>      In August, one of our team members paid a visit to Kanagawa Institute of Technology in pursuit of team collaboration and friendship. We exchanged ideas of IGEM, team current work of our projects and future potential collaboration.We also held a modeled presentation for the purpose of both enhancing our presentation skills and figure out ambiguous parts in our project, which might be challenged in Giant Jamboree. Their project this year is about solving allergic system problem, which really inspired our team in many aspects.</P></DIV><H4>	Belgium: Team KU Leuven</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Multilateral collaboration in translating projects</H6><P>      We sincerely appreciate the invitation from team KU Leuven in Belgium for team collaboration. Due to language hurdle, the spread of synthetic biology and the communication of each teams’ projects have encountered hindrance. Therefore, we decided to translate each teams’ project description into their native language respectively. This translation project is comprised of several teams worldwide with different languages. We are honorably served as one of the members of it and responsible for Traditional Chinese.  Through this multilateral collaboration, we have learned many aspects of synthetic biology and combined them with our education human practice. </P></DIV><H4>	 iGEM Franconia</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><H6 style="color:#886600;">Asist team Franconia on their education project</H6><P>We noticed an interesting collaboration request on iGEM Community Collaboration page and decided to communicate with the Franconia team. NYMU team got this amazing opportunity to collaborate with iGEM teams around the globe by designing and finishing the translation of the biological themed card (whose idea originated from Franconia team) into universal languages. The biological themed card is a card game where the basic deck contains cards that can be pathogens, cures, preventatives, or anything that influences human health. Since the NYMU team has specialists in the field of medicine, we collaborated with team Franconia and other iGEM teams to help the iGEM community translate the biological themed card into traditional Chinese.
We believe that this cooperation is significantly meaningful because not only does this card game raise people’s awareness of pathogens and biosafety issues, but also the translation of the basic deck into universal languages can help the biological themed card itself extended to more areas in the world. We are honored to collaborate with these teams and deeply believe that our translation can make people stay away from anything that negatively impacts their health. The following PDF file is our translation.</P></DIV><DIV id="Traditional-Chinese-by-NYMU-Tapei"><H6>Traditional-Chinese version</H6></DIV><DIV id="iGEM-Franconia-version"><H6>Original version</H6></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content5"><H4>	Asia Pacific Conference</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><P>Later in July, we attended the 5th Annual Asia Pacific Conference held at National Chiao Tung University. During the four-day event, we had the opportunity to meet around 25 iGEM teams – from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the US. The conference began with each team displaying their posters and getting a big picture of what everyone’s project is about. For the following days, each team would each hold a 40-minute presentation session with Q&amp;A time. Through our presentation, our presenters acquired a sense of what the final presentation at Giant Jamboree will be like. Furthermore, during the Q&amp;A session, we received many feedbacks in regards to improvements that could be made -- including the utilization of waste proteins that are produced in the cycle of biofuel. For the rest of the conference we attended others’ presentations; by listening to every team’s progress and obtaining a sense of the field they are researching in, we were able to acknowledge the pros and cons of our own project while seeking for possible collaborations. For example, we were able to establish a partnership with National Chang Gung University -- allowing us to collaborate on the presentation brought forth to Wego Billingual High School. Likewise, we also got to know the members of NTHU_Taiwan; they introduced us to NTHU Professor Yang, who taught us how to use photobioreactor to detect algae growth curve.   Still, this conference was extremely valuable not only because we were able to learn from each other, but more importantly due to the fact that we had the privilege to talk and spend time with people of same interests!</P></DIV><H4>	Taiwan Conference</H4><DIV style="margin-left:3%;"><P>On July 17, 2017, we attended the conference hosted by National Chang Gung University. Teams all around Taiwan attended this conference. This was the first iGEM conference we attended, on top of it being the first opportunity we had to meet other teams. We were extremely thrilled to be able to share our project and listen to other teams' projects. We spent the entire day talking to other teams and getting to know their progress. We started off with an icebreaker where teams were asked to describe their project in less than 1 minute. This was a fun activity as it encouraged members to simplify their projects to the basics. In the afternoon, we presented our project and received feedback from the other teams. As a result of the conference, we were able to establish friendships with several teams that we later met at The Asia Pacific iGEM conference. Also, we were able to brainstorm on possible collaborations by getting a glimpse of what each team's project is about; for instance, we learned that National Chang Gung University shares a similar denitrification mechanism as us, eventually, this led to a successful collaboration between the two iGEM teams. This was an important milestone for NYMU-TAIPEI iGEM team because it was our first contact with the public and, overall, we were exhilarated to meet teams from all over Taiwan. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
