Plant Synthetic Biology
Microalgae is characterized by its high proliferation rate and capacity of being amenable to genetic engineering. It is a popular biotechnology platform, producing biofuel and high valued products under genetic manipulation. Yet, a comprehensive system of microalgae synthetic biology has been absent in IGEM projects. This year, NYMU-Taipei created an exhaustive system of microalgae synthetic biology with a cascade of detailed information and protocols from culturing system to transformation. We have transformed multiple pigmentation functions from other species into Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to analyze photosynthetic efficiency and other factors. Much effort has been put into determining the compatibility and expression of promoters, coding sequences, and terminator through numerous experiments. Transformation procedures have been slightly modified and clearly demonstrated on our wiki page. The potential of this new platform in IGEM will bring a profound impact to future teams.
This figure is pPIGBACK-CrtZ transformants electrophoresis result. C1~C20 represents the pPIGBACK-CrtZ transformant clone 1 to clone 20, and M represnets 1 kb marker. Transformation efficiency of pPIGBACK-CrtZ is 11.4 transformants per Î¼g DNA, and correctness is 52% (10/19), which is relatively high compared to low successful rate of gene recombination.
