Public Engagement
The NYMU-Taipei Team has attended iGEM for over ten years, so this year, as the 11th team of NYMU, we arranged the 10 Year Anniversary Exhibition. Not only did we interview past NYMU iGEMers, we also introduced these topics to other iGEM teams, high school students, teachers, and the public. For instance, after we gave a tour to members of the Genetic Engineering Club of The Affiliated High School of National Cheng Chi University, they decided to set up an iGEM team for the following year. To bring more high school students to the field of synthetic biology and iGEM, we also visited Taipei First Girls High School and Taipei Wego Private High School to present. In Wego, we gave a speech to science teachers and a student body of over 200 students. As a result, we inspired them to potentially create a new team for the upcoming 2018 Giant Jamboree.
