Chang, Chuan-Hsiung (Instructor) 張傳雄
Professor Chang is our lead instructor; he always gives valuable advice to us. He is a very kind person: when we run experiments at midnight, he often waits until when we have all completed and drives us back to our dorms. Not willing to miss any of our hard-working moments, he likes to take pictures of us working as a team. He gives us great encouragement and always has our back. The 2017 NYMU iGEM team is not complete without him.
Chou,Tzu-Ho (Instructor) 周子禾
Words cannot describe how awesome Dr. Chou is. Dr. Chou trains and instructs all of our iGEM experiments. He patiently helps us and teaches us step by step. He is also a very approachable person. In some cases, he is our friend rather than our instructor. We often play card games with him in leisure time. We are grateful for his guidance.
Jude Clapper (Instructor)
Mr. Clapper is awesome! He often meets us with a big smile and always shares his past iGEM experiences. Throughout the whole preparation for this year's iGEM, he has assisted us by clarifying everything we are unsure about. Though we usually speak Chinese during the meeting, he still pays attention to our discussions and never get distracted or stops us when we are having some discussions. We are glad that we have him to take a part in our iGEM team!
