InterLab Measurement Studies
Since iGEM is an international competition with many teams from all over the world, it is inevitably coping with the problem of unreproducible scientific measurement results. Multiple teams are measuring fluorescence differently, in different units and are evaluating the results non-identically. Therefore, the InterLab Study aims to develop a standardized protocol for repeatable fluorescence measurements of GFP.  The study should be carried out and examined in different laboratories all over the world.  Our team followed the standardized procedure guiding us through transformation, inoculation and measurement process.

Fluorescein standard curve
The fluorescence of a dilution series, fluorescein in four replicates, were measured in standard modes in our tecan plate reader (infinite 200Pro).
Table 2. Fluorescence measurement of fluorescein in eleven dilutions and one control containing PBS. Measurement settings for the plate reader: Excitation 485 nm, Emission 530 nm, 50 gains and 20 flashes.
Generated standard curve of fluorescence for different fluorescein concentrations can be found below.

Cell Measurement
Fluorescence and Absorbance 600 Measurement
Fluorescence and absorbance was measured from six different devices, positive and negative control which are built in pSB1C3 containing chloramphenicol resistance. Samples were taken after 0, 2, 4, 6 h.
The arithmetic mean from two colonies was calculated and can be found below.

Conclusion
Examining the measurement results: device 1,2 and 4 are similar to the positive control, these express GFP. In comparison, device 3 and 6 are similar to the negative control and do not express GFP.
During measurements we differed the gains up to 70 in plate reader settings and noticed a hundredfold higher fluorescence data.
This could influence the reproducibility from laboratory to laboratory.
