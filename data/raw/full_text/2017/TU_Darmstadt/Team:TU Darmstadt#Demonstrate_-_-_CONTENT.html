We wanted to produce chitin as precursor for our designer Chitosan in <I>E. coli</I>, using the chitin synthase NodC. We were able to express the chitin synthase NodC in <I>E. coli</I> Top10 successfully. The protein was tagged with a His‑tag and purified via an ÄKTA system. To verify the expression and purification a SDS-PAGE was done.
The functionality of the NodC enzyme was verified by performing the <I>UDP-Glo™ Glycosyltransferase</I> Assay. The evaluation of the assay shows that the NodC enzyme converts the UDP-GlcNAc to free UPD and a growing oligo‑GlcNAc‑chain. The free UDP is converted to ATP, which acts as a substrate for a luciferase reaction and creates luminescence. So the assay and the increasing luminescence depending on increasing enzyme concentrations shows that the <B>NodC enzyme can create chitin oligomers. </B><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/project/chitin_synthase#five">See more Details</A></P></DIV><CENTER><FIGCAPTION style="width:80%;"><B>Figure 1. Activity assay of NodC.</B> The NodC (40 ng) was titrated in 1X glycosyltransferase reaction buffer in the presence of 100 μM of UDP-<I>N</I>-acetylglcosamine and 10 mM <I>N</I>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) as an acceptor substrate. The reaction was performed as described before and the luminescence was measured after 1 hour of incubation with a <I>Tecan200 Infinite Pro</I> plate reader. Each point is an average of two experiments, and the error bars represent the standard deviations. RLU = relative light units.

In order to produce our designer chitosan as a wound healing improving material in our hydrogel, we used the chitin deacetylase NodB. We verified the expression of NodB in <I>E. coli</I> BL21 with a SDS-Page. After tagging the protein with a His-Tag, we performed purification and refolding through an ÄKTA pure system, and verified the success through another SDS-Page.
To test whether NodB works properly, we used the acetic acid assay kit (<I>Acetate Kinase Manual Format</I>, Megazyme, Bray, Ireland). NodB deacetylates chitin to create chitosan. This chemical step releases acetic acid. The amount of acetic acid is indirectly measured via amount of NAD+. Thus, the rate of acetic acid is stoichiometric with the amount of NAD+ in the last reaction step.
As the graph shows, this verification was successful and indicates that NodB was refolded properly and is present in its active form.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/project/chitin_deacetylase#three">See more Details</A></P></DIV><CENTER><FIGCAPTION style="width:80%;"><B>Figure 2. Activity Assay of NodB.</B> Detected acetic acid after 76 minutes in 20 %, 15 % and 10 % sample volume generated by NodB in 60 % standard solution. Four samples with 1 mM chitin pentamers and 2.5 µM purified NodB were previously incubated overnight in NH4HCO3 adjusted to pH 9 at 37°C. Afterwards these were heat-inactivated for 20 minutes at 80 °C. The measurement with <I>Tecan200 infinte Pro</I> plate reader ranged over 76 minutes.

Supposing to build an ideal scaffold for our smart protease-sensing bandage, we manufactured several hydrogels containing non-toxic and cost-effective gelling agents. Our hydrogels could be formed with basic laboratory equipment at any shape and could easily be adjusted to the affected tissues for optimal wound healing.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/project/hydrogel">See more Details</A></P></DIV><CENTER><FIGCAPTION style="width:80%;"><B>Figure 3.

They can be used as a basis for a medically applicable wound cover.

In the interest of adding the abillity to detect pathogenic bacteria to our hydrogel, we manufactured a <B>protease‑sensing</B> chitosan derivative. Therefore, we immobilized a quenched flourophor via a  specific peptide linker.  For the verifaction of its functionality it was measured via a fluorometer. It showed a peak at 390 nm before the protease was added. After cleavage with proteases, a shift of this peak to the wavelength of 450 nm was observed.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/project/chemistry#results">See more Details</A></P></DIV><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 5.

To show that our project works, we manufactured a chitosan hydrogel with a fluorophore coupled to it.
Upon addition of a protease solution to our <B>ChiTUcare prototype</B>, the hydrogel starts to glow under UV light within 7 minutes (the video speed was increased).

This proves our concept of a protease sensing hydrogel on the basis of chitosan.

As an easy and cheap to manufacture prototype, we provide an eco-friendly and adjustable system to nurture wound-healing with an antibacterial, anti-viral wound dressing, that works as a sensor for bacterial infection by emitting a blue light within minutes upon irradiation of non-hazardous UV light.
