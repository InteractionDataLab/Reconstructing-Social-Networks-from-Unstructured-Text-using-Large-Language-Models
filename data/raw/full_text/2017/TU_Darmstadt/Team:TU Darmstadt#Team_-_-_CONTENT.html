Last year was the first time that I got the chance to be a part of the iGEM team TU Darmstadt. 
This gave me the opportunity to work on our own project and try to contribute to its planning. One additional great attribute of iGEM is that it enabled me to work with many different students from different departments like Biology, Physics, Computer Sciences or Sociology. 
This year, as part of the project coordination, I want to experience the tasks that come along with organizing an interdisciplinary project. I am looking forward to this challenge and I am excited for this year’s project and team!

I am always happy to see a new team grow together (and learn together as a team). In 2017 an exciting project will be realized, with which we will totally save the world! Or have fun doing our own science, but that's almost the same anyway. This is my third year in which I supervise iGEM at TU Darmstadt, so I’m sure it is going to be a very special year! I look forward to the challenges and discussions, the international meet-ups, and the team-BBQ nights!

It’s my first iGEM year. I’m one of the project consultants, which means, that I do workshops, seminaries and team supporting events. In my opinion the mixture between fun, team spirit and productivity is essential for a good team result, but it needs to be promoted like any other soft skill. My experiences as a trainer are helpful to achieve this goal. I enjoy working with motivated people and I think iGEM is a great chance for young students to work in an interdisciplinary project and to improve for example their lab skills. I’m convinced that our team has a good chance to develop an amazing project, because of the big diversity of interesting characters of the team and I’m really glad to be a part of that team.

Gude,

My name is Maximilian Zander and I am studying Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt in my 1th master semester. I already participated on the last 2 years in the iGEM team and gathered a lot of positive experience (not only in the laboratory) as well as networking with a lot of young, motivated students. That is why I want to be a part of iGEM TU Darmstadt 2017. I am very excited to work on this huge team on own ideas and generate an extraordinary project.

Already in my first semester, I learned about iGEM and this year, I can be a member of the iGEM Team for the first time.

The project allows me to optimize my independent working and organizational skills.

At the end of the fourth semester, I will have all the basic modules finished. That's why I would like to take the opportunity to extend my abilities outside normal studies. This I hope to experience with great joy and collegial teamwork.

I wanted to join iGEM ever since I started my studies. I thought it was great that we could apply the knowledge that we were learning in the lectures and learn about teamwork! I found that a big difference between iGEM and usual practical courses was that the group had to organize itself. This gave us a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of freedom. I was confronted with a new type of challenge. That is, organizing and working with the group, all the while still taking care of my other responsibilities. Overall, I have learned to work in a lab, thanks to the helpful advice of the other more experienced members. It has been a lot of fun and I can´t wait to see the results of our work !

This semester it is the first time for me to take part in the iGEM-competion. When I heard of this competition in the middle of my second semester, I decided to take part next year. My motivation is on the one hand the practical learning of laboratory work, apart the short practice in university courses, on the other side participating in a project organized by students in all its facets like project finding, sponsoring, laboratory work, public relations work, ethical benefit and project organization.

Through my participation in the last year’s iGEM team I could learn much and I like the independent work in the lab. Another reason is that I like to work in a team and I like to meet new people and have a great time with them. This year I’m not working in the lab on my own, but I support my team with knowledge and experience. Furthermore I take part in the Human Practices and sponsoring team

This year is my first time taking part in the iGEM competition and I´m absolutely fascinated by the chance to independently promote the research and development of a project so closely related to a subject which has been fascinating me since my childhood. Biological research has always been connected to a strong interdisciplinary background and thanks to iGEM I hope to personally develop a better understanding of the different disciplines involved with the construction of a larger scientific project to be better prepared for my future career. iGEM offers me a perfect opportunity to learn about self-organized project management during my undergraduate studies.

I am part of the iGEM Team for the first time this year. The idea of working in a group, self-organized on a self-elected project is what fascinates and motivates me. I am excited to gain more experience about self-contained working in the laboratory. Furthermore I am looking forward for the possibilities of learning new skills, contribute my own ideas and to get the opportunity to gain an insight into synthetic biology. I think iGEM is a unique possibility to do something practical beside the daily university routine, especially for people who are doing their Bachelor studies.

Just like some of the team members from the 4. semester I am new to iGEM. Yet I see great opportunities for myself in it, thus being first of all the broadening of my horizons considering laboratory work and practical experience. Nevertheless, I hope for enriching exchange with professors and older students. hose hopes are going into fullfilling. I learn new things every day and my fascination for synthetic biology rises at the same rate.

I joined iGEM for the first time this year. An especially interesting aspect of this project is the self-organized work in the laboratory on a self-elected project. I am exited to gain more experience concerning planning and working on a biological question. iGEM is unique in the sense that it gives participants the opportunity to gather more practical know-how in addition to regular experiments in the lab. Other than these aspects, team-work is a big part of the competition. This work with others in how to solve a problem, together with team building activities, is a big part why I wanted to help on this years iGEM team.

I joined the iGEM team because I heared that it’s an amazing experience and it’s a chance to do very high level science with a lot of freedom. The endless possibilities and opportunities in the field of synthetic biology caught my attention and nudged me to participate in our team. I will do my best to apply existing biological knowledge to hopefully solve a scientific problem with other students. I think that this kind of project is really unique and I should not miss it. Participating in a worldwide competition is a unique opportunity to get more experienced in the field of synthetic biology. Reading more about the iGEM competition made me very excited and now I’m a very happy and proud member of our top-notch team. In addition to the lab work, we get to work with students from other departments and learn of other projects from around the world.

If you want to get know the whole IGEM experience, participating once is not enough. That's why I decided to do it again. The outstanding impressions of the last year are still a big motivation to improve my scientific horizon. Even though it is challenging to organise my research on lab automatization and managing a sub project of TU Darmstadt's main project, the reward I am getting is tremendous. Furthermore, connecting with young researchers all over the world is a big chance to open up my point of views.

iGEM was introduced to me by friends. Their motivation and enthusiasm infected me straight away. As physicists we rarely have contact with the actual problems of synthetic biology. It thrills me to now have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore I like the interdisciplinarity, the team based research, the autonomy of the project and the simple fun while constructing something. This versatility is unknown to me and I am glad to complement my studies with iGEM.

In my first year as a igem member I want to achieve a deeper understanding of synthetic Biology, but also in other disciplines that are connected in the broadest sense. Therefore I decide to join the technology team which design a digital holographic microscope this year. The good thing about this project is that as a student your able to see many different fields of sciens and lern how to manage to work on a big project with higher goal than just to bring a short internship to the end. In the end I also looking forward to meet many new people and become a team which works effectivly.
