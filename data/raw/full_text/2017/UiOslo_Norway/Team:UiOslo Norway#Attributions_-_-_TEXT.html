Throughout this year, everyone on the team has done their fair share of work, as documented in the team members-page and the notebook on the wiki. However, we would never have pulled through had it not been for all the people who assisted and supported us throughout the project. These following people have been of great help for the project, and have our wholehearted gratitude for spending time and energy on helping us pull through.
Dirk Linke
Professor at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
Main supervisor for the team, and has spent large amounts of time and energy on guiding us through the project, as well as helping with registrations and general labwork.
Eric de Muinck
Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo>
Like Dirk, Eric has been one of the main supervisors for the team. He has given useful advice throughout the project, and has helped on labwork, design of primers and parts, and more.
Athanasios Saragliadis
Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
Has assisted greatly with general labwork, as well as primer- and parts design.
Sandra Lopez-Avilez
Research group leader at the Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), UiO
Supervisor for the work in the yeast lab, and has assisted in design of primers and parts.
Joakim Bergli
Professor at the Department of Physics, University of Oslo
Main physics supervisor.
Agniezska Wrobel
PhD Candidate at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
Assisted with the E.Coli-transformations and extraction of sfGFP.
Daniel Hatlem
PhD Candidate at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
Assisted with transformation of cells and wavelength measurements during the InterLab Study experiments.
Kirsten Borse Haraldsen
Librarian at the Science Library, University of Oslo
Set up multiple meetings and presentations for us, and organized food and drink for everyone on those occasions.
Elina Melteig
Communications advisor at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
As a former iGEM team member, Elina was capable of advising us on how we should plan and execute our media outreach. She was also a photographer for several of our events.
Nanna Winger Steen
Head Engineer, Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis
Head contact person for the lab used for cloning. Also instructed us in DNA lab HSE.
Alexander Lincoln Read
Professor at the Department of Physics, University of Oslo
Was generous to give us lab space at the physics department and came with tips on how to make a good setup.
Mikkel Meyn Liljegren
Engineer at CEES
Assisted us with the molecular biology labwork.
Vilte Stonyte
Ph.D. student at NCMM
Assisted us with the yeast lab work
Bård Enger Mathiesen
Principal Engineer at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
Assisted in the sample sequencing
Sigurd R. Klæva
Project assistant, Cutting Edge Festival
Set up the festival and helped us getting a great poster session together
Steinar Mortensen
Administrative Manager at the Department of Bioscience, University of Oslo
Assisted with sending and collecting items for use in our project
Jack Christopher Leo
Researcher at Section for Genetics and Evolutionary Biology, University of Oslo
Helped us with the InterLab Study and the protein extraction
Nils-Olav Skeie
Associate professor, PhD
Assisted us with the making of the LED
Ainar Drews
PhD Candiate - Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo
Was very helpful during the process of finding equipment for the laser setup. He showed us where we could find color filters and a CCD-camera, and came with great ideas on how to make a good setup.
Cinzia Anita Maria Progida
Associate Professor, Institute of Biosciences, University of Oslo
As an expert in fluorescence microscopy, she provided invaluable feedback on the prospect of a biolaser, our plans for going forward with the project, and the commercial potential of biolaser measurement.
Rein Aasland
Department Head, Institute of Biosciences, University of Oslo
Attended presentation along with several experts in biosciences and physics, gave useful feedback on project plans and bioscience aspects.
Oddmund Bakke
Professor, Institute of Biosciences, University of Oslo
As an expert in fluorescence microscopy, he gave useful feedback on thoughts on how to carry the project through, as well as his thoughts on "selling" the project and the current prospect of biolaser measurement in academia.
Thomas Trunk
Ph.D candidate, Institute of Biosciences, University of Oslo
Was very helpful during the process of finding equipment for the laser setup. He showed us where we could find color filters and a CCD-camera, and came with great ideas on how to make a good setup.
Dan Michael Heggø
Academic Librarian - Science Library, University of Oslo
Gave us useful comments regarding the wiki at all times when we needed assistance.
