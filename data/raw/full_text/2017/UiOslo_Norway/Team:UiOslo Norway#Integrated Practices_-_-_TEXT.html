We wanted further insight on the feasibility and usability of a bio-laser as a measurement tool. Because of this, we presented our ideas to a group of fluorescence microscopy experts on the 31st of August, led by Professor Oddmund Bakke and Associate Professor Cinzia Progida . As they have a lot of experience in the field of intracellular visualization and measurement, they were able to give a lot of useful feedback in terms of what they thought about using a bio-laser as a measurement tool. The big takeaway from this session was that although they thought the idea was interesting, to invest in a tool like this, it would be necessary with solid documentation that a bio-laser was significantly more sensitive than current methods of measurement, as it would compete with several similar methods of measurement. Another issue was price; we did manage to make our setup extremely cheap thanks to the use of LED-circuits as our external light source, and it was suggested that a simple, more compact setup at a similar price level might be a viable product to use for experiments in school laboratories. In conclusion, the session here made us reconsider the focus of our project; what was originally a plan to develop a specific product was changed into managing a practical proof-of-concept of a biolaser as a measurement tool.
We were also keen to hear what other experts in the fields of both bioscience and physics thought about our project. As such, we gathered an expert group along with Rein Aasland, Department head of the Institute of Bioscience, UiO, and presented our initial plans for the project to them. We were met with enthusiasm, and we were able to gather much useful practical knowledge for what we'd have to do in the labwork, thoughts on the optics necessary, and the genetics of yeast cells.
IBV Department head Rein Aasland and several experts in biosciences and physics were the audience for one of our presentations.
