Helene: Joined the team.
Kristina:Participated in lab work regarding sfGFP isolation.
Aman: Worked on wiki template
June
Eirik: worked on designing parts and primers for the project. Participated in labwork.
Hilde: Did some more research/talking to professors regarding what kind of equipment we needed for the biolaser.
Elisabeth: Research regarding equipment and started looking around for possible sponsors.
Helene: Started to understand what the project was all about and got updated on what had happened since February.
Kristina: Finished mandatory tour of the lab and safety requirements to be able to work in the lab.

Can: Finished mandatory tour of the lab and safety requirements to be able to work in the lab.
Aman: Held presentation for professors and researchers at the Science Library.
July
Eirik: Participated in labwork for the InterLab Measurement Study and for molecular cloning.
Hilde: Made a LED as lab equipment with help from Nils-Olav Skeie, wrote some modelling, also contacted Alex regarding using his lab
Elisabeth: Attended the physics lab, where we worked on our current set-up. Trying to reach out to Thorlabs at this point, to get the right equipment.
Helene: Started the search for equipment for the physics lab, and sent a BUNCH of e-mails to every possible laser owner in Oslo.
Kristina:Worked in the lab with insertion of nmt1 and cyc1 into submission vector.
Aman : Worked on wiki design.
August
Can: Made github for iGEM tools, and program to search the iGEM registry for parts.
Eirik: Participated in labwork for cloning, protein exta and for the InterLab Measurement Study. Held presentations for new physics students and new bioscience master students.
Hilde: did some more phys-lab, also arranged and held the presentation for the new physics students with Eirik
Elisabeth: Got in touch with Thorlabs, who agreed to sponsor us. Also had a meeting with another possible sponsor, as well as acquiring sequencing for DNA from GATC. Worked at the physics lab testing GFP with the current setup. Started running the social media pages. Helene: Managed to borrow color filters and a CCD-camera from the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics. Tested a GFP sample with our current setup.
Kristina :  Participated in labwork for cloning, protein exta and for the InterLab Measurement Study.
Dejana :  Participated in labwork for the InterLab Measurement Study.
Aman : Continued work on the wiki.
September
Eirik: Joined for the NTNU workshop. Participated in molecular cloning labwork, miniprepping, PCR, gel analysis and sequencing setup.
Hilde: More phys-lab while also writing for the wiki and some simple illustrations for the wiki
Elisabeth: Held a practice presentation with Elena to get feedback for the project. Worked at the physics lab while figuring out which equipment we needed from Thorlabs. Running facebook-page with more updates on the team.
Helene: Did more lab work and made more LED-circuits with red and green light. Tested the GFP with our modified setup and with the different LED-circuits. Presented our project at the Cutting Edge Festival at UiO. Kristina:Worked in the lab with insertion of nmt1 and composite part into submission vector. Took part in NTNU workshop.
Dejana :Worked in the lab with insertion of nmt1, cyc1 and composite part into submission vector. Took part in NTNU workshop.
Can :Worked in the lab with insertion of nmt1, cyc1 and composite part into submission vector. Took part in NTNU workshop.
Aman: More work on wiki. Talked to Center for Digital Life Norway regarding sponsorship. Participated in workshop at NTNU.
October
Eirik: Presented for the minister of education. Participated in molecular cloning labwork, miniprepping, PCR, gel analysis and sequencing setup. Very active in writing to the wiki
Aman: Organized wiki-workshop every week or twice a week. Added large amounts of wiki content, as well as editing and formatting a large amount of the content others wrote. Wrapped up the wiki work with assistance of the team.
Hilde: Final phys-lab work, also worked on getting some merchandise for the group. Actively participated in the wiki writing.
Elisabeth: Finally received equipment from Thorlabs. Final physics lab work, now also testing yeast in addition to more GFP. Contacting sponsors in order to get logos and how they wish to be represented.  More social media. Actively participated in wiki writing.
Helene: Finalized the setup and tested it with GFP and yeast. Did the final lab work and wrote on the wiki.
Kristina:Worked in the lab with insertion of nmt1 and composite part into submission vector. Testing out modifications of protocols. Wrote parts for the wiki.
Dejana :Worked in the lab with insertion of composite part into submission vector. Wrote parts for the wiki. Prepared yeast cells for the biolaser. Worked on collaboration with Hefei University of Technology.
Can :Worked in the lab with insertion composite part into submission vector and shipping. Worked on the Wiki. Worked with transformation of yeast cells.
