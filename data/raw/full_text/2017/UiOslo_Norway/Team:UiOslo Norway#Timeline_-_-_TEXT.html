iGEM 2017 Begins
Feb
Team Building Activities
Getting to know each other. Meetings :D
March
Brainstorming for Projects
Deciding on projects: chief candidates are biolaser and formaldehyde detection. Attended BioBrick-tutorial with other Scandinavian teams.
Decided that our project would be about making a biolaser!
April
The real work begins...
Presenting our project ideas at Realistforeningen. Actively recruiting new members, particularly physicists. Planning the summer. Trying to find supervisors.
May
Exam lull
Coordinated with external supervisors. Created the script for parts searching. Decided on use of biological parts. Considered options for laser setup and sponsors. Extracted sfGFP from E. Coli, for use as proof-of-concept tests.
Exams over... the work commences!
June
Parts design and InterLab Study
Started working on the InterLab Study. Started actively designing parts and primers, synthesized generously by the courtesy of IDT. Presented for the head of institute at the Department of Biosciences. Landed interview with Porsgrunn Dagblad.
July
In the summertime
InterLab take #2 (we had problems with our first attempt), successful this time. Landed sponsoring deal with OsloTech, scheduled to present at Cutting Edge festival. Agreeing on collaboration with teams from NTNU and Hefei. Started attempting transformations of E.Coli and cloning of parts into pSB1C3, and composite part into pJK148 (yeast expression vector). Began the first attempts to make a proper laser setup.
Starting experiments with sfGFP in laser setup
Aug
The dreaded end of summer
Presented for an expert group that provided feedback on our ideas. Landed sponsoring with Thorlabs, GATC and Senter for Digitalt Liv Oslo. Presented for bioscience master student and new physics students. Continued working on cloning, but facing problems. Heavy troubleshooting. Harvested a new batch of sfGFP. Participated in ethics discussion arranged by Uppsala iGEM.
Sept
Presentations, frustrations and collaborations
Held poster session at the Cutting Edge festival. More cloning and troubleshooting. Visited NTNU to hold mock presentation, and team up for collaboration.
The final sprint
Oct
Wrapping up
Managed to successfully clone composite part and nmt1 into submission vector. Equipment from Thorlabs arrived, were able to test laser setup with mirrors on both sfGFP-expressing yeast and a extracted protein solution. Presented our work to the Norwegian Minister of Education.  Wrapped up collaboration with Hefei and NTNU. Wrote most part of the wiki.
Nov
The great jamboree!
Wrapped up the wiki, making final poster, then attending the jamboree!
