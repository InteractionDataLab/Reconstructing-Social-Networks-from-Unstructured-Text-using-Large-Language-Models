What we needed
At the beginning of summer we started reaching out to several possible contacts. Our main focus was on businesses established at UiO Forskningsparken, that could benefit not only from our scientific advances but also from having a stronger bond with students at the University of Oslo.  After a presentation at OsloTech we got a few possible contacts that we approached over the summer. Our most important goal at this moment was to get in touch with someone who could help us with equipment for the lab. As we wanted to do a laser setup, the equipment provided from the university was somewhat limited.  Professor Alex Read provided us with a lab that we were able to keep over the summer up until the project was finished, as well as lenses, filters and a spectrometer. What was missing was mirrors and stronger filters. Initially we were hoping to get a laser, but this proved to be most difficult as we were working with blue light.  Other than sponsored equipment we were hoping to get funds for things like our poster for the Jamboree and rollup for presentation, and maybe also t-shirts.
Method
What we started by doing was to write a pitch in both Norwegian and English that we could e-mail out to any possible contacts. The next step would be to give the contact a call. Getting in touch with possible sponsors over the summer turned out to be quite hard, but by August we managed to get in touch with Thorlabs and they agreed to sponsor us with everything we needed! The same month we got a reply from GATC who were willing to help us out with some barcodes for the sequencing of DNA samples.  Last, but definitely not least, we got in touch with “Senter for Digitalt Liv Norge”, which is a virtual centre supporting over 12 research projects across differents universities of Norway. They wished to sponsor us with 25000,- NOK, which helped us out a lot.
About Thorlabs
Thorlabs, a vertically integrated photonics products manufacturer, was founded in 1989 to serve the laser and electro-optics research market. As that market has spawned a multitude of technical innovations, Thorlabs has extended its core competencies in an effort to play an ever increasing role serving the Photonics Industry at the research end, as well as the industrial, life science, medical, and defense segments. The organization’s highly integrated and diverse manufacturing assets include semiconductor fabrication of laser diodes, optical amplifiers, lithium niobate modulators, quantum cacscade/interband cascade lasers, and VCSEL lasers; fiber towers for drawing glass optical fibers (silica, fluoride, tellurite, and hollow core); MBE/MOCVD epitaxial wafer growth reactors; extensive glass and metal fabrication facilities; advanced thin film deposition capabilities; and optomechanical and optoelectronic shops.
About Centre for Digital Life Norway
Centre for Digital Life Norway is a unique transdisciplinary research centre creating the biotechnology for tomorrow. Our aim is to evolve new knowledge and methods to create value and address societal challenges. The initiative is an unprecedented collaborative effort by the three major universities in Norway and the Norwegian Research Council, putting forward more than 30 mill € to create a cutting-edge virtual centre for computationally based biotechnology research and innovation.
