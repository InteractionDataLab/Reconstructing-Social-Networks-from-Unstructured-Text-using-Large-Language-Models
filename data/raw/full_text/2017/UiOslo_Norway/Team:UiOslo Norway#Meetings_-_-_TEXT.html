-Most of us is done with the presentation-part. Elisabeth and Hilde posted about the presentation on social media.
-Apparently Hilde volunteered to take minutes, she will continue to do this.
PRESENTATION
-Presentation practice on Wedensday. Eirik, Aman and Tharald will be presenting, they will schedule a time.
-Eirik will fix the presentation (PP)
-Start to perpare, or at least have it on our minds, for future presentation. Selling point, make sure it make sense for non-bio-people, this is important stuff to think about.
UPDATE ON EXPERIMENTS
-Remember: Always two people at the lab due to security and help.
GFP
-Nobody had time to contact the previus teams since last meeting.
-Contact Denmark, they have one optimized for yeast, probably one for E.coli as well. (Adel will do this) Make sure Eric reads through before we contact them
-Contact Cambrigde - they have two different parts. (Adel will do this). Same as above.
-Take the biobrick we already have and use that. (Eirik will take a look at it?)
Laser

Agenda 09.05.17
New member!
-Say hello to Elena!
Updates; what have people been doing the last week?
Starting labwork asap
- A lot of the theory necessary to start is done. We should try to get to the lab as soon as possible.
- Can we do it this week? Who has time?
-Initial plans are just E.Coli-transformation with GFP.
Project plan overall
-Supervisors have a meeting this Thursday, we need to get a basic experimental setup down (ref: Dirk), preferably with references to explain why we're doing what we're doing. Need to sit down and make this asap.
Activity logging
-There's a notebook-function in the iGEM wiki where we can note down what we've done each week.  -It's recommended that we use this each week so that we know who has been doing what. Easy to set up (we can just copy-paste some tables).
Sponsoring
-Anything more on this?
GROUP PICTURE.
- Plz
Misc
Minutes 16.05.17
Agenda 16.05.17
Weekly updates from everyone; what have you been doing?
Labwork has started; the more help the better!

-Plan thus far:
Thursday 16.30: short day
Friday 10.00: long day
Monday: 10.00: long day(?)
Tuesday 10.00: long day
Plan for meeting the competition goals

-As many as possible should participate, and everyone needs to be prepared for such a meeting (i.e. read the goals and think about how we can reach them).
Make a pitch for sponsors
- Someone needs to take responsibility for this.
Misc
Minutes 26.05.17
New member(s)!
-Say hello to Helene! And, Elena, to those who haven't met her yet.
Updates; what have people been doing the last week?
- Eirik - talked to NTNU, maybe meetup this summer? Attended lab, read some articles
- Aman - Looked at Wiki stuff
- Adel - Attended lab,
- Dejana - Attended lab, calculating,
- Hilde - fixed the calendar, added people to mailinglist and stuff
- Elisabeth -  Looked at mirror stuff with Hilde and realized we needed one more person
- Helene - joined the team!
- Dirk - Supervisor meeting
Labwork; progress
- We have a GFP -  sample that should work, it is not completely pure, but should work.
- Now we need to go to the laser parts.
Project plan overall
-We need to read the criteria and make plan, at least the biobricks, people have exams.
Wiki and Activity logging
- Use wiki as a journal for the labwork. We can add pictures, we should also design a logo.
-Aman can help us. Please look at previous wiki or other webpage so we can brainstorm for the design.
Sponsoring
- Elisabeth and Eirik will finalize a pitch, and then Elisabeth will go to people after her final exam (15th of june).
- Carl Zeiss AS, is maybe a company we can contact.
- Maybe we don’t need to wait for a sponsor for getting a mirror.  Give a number to Dirk and maybe we can order some.
Meeting with CEES / updates on yeast lab?
- We will make a doodle,  deadline for answering  is tomorrow. We will need to pitch a plan for them before we can start.
GROUP PICTURE.
- Done
Todo:
- Make plan for the judging criteria
- Go to the CEES lab, schedule it
- Can we make an easier laser, just switch out the light in the middle with the sample?
Minutes 31.05.17
- Talking about lasers and stuff: contact Oddmund Bakke for equipment to cannibalize
- Delft printed biofilm and stuff; make things affordable is a good idea
- Create project plan by flowchart:
figure out what we actually need, building a project with the different parts in mind
make it stepwise
Basic steps most important
Tie it in to the judging / medal criteria
Compare the superfolded GFP we used to the parts that are in the registry.
Minutes 19.06.17
Agenda 19.06.17
- Can we use just plain LED light or do we need, we need to look at what kind of GFP we have
What have we been doing?
- Eirik: Have been talking to Dirk and Eric, have had exams.
- Dejana and Can (head of Labwork) can take responsibilty for the bio-stuff.
- Elisabeth is "responsible" for human practices
- The physicists can manage the physics stuff.
Presentation
- We will have a presentation on June 30th. There gonna be a sponsering potential from that presentation. Can will be helping, try to show up - not all have to talk but it is positive if everyone try to show up.
- There wil be trialrun next Wedensday at 17.00 (28th) we will have this with a weekly meeting. Remember to add it to the calendar!
Misc
- We need to fix a GFP biobrick. And fix the GFP for yeast. Good for medal criteria. Every single genetic bio unit, is a part. (Like a promoter)
- We need to figure out the GFP sequence, and we need to look at the iGEM registry to see if someone has the same. REMEMBER TO DOCUMENT THIS, post it on wiki.
- Two deadlines is coming up; safty forms and description. Talk to Sandra regarding safty forms for the yeast part. Maybe for laser if we end up using a laser (Maybe Elisabeth can talk to Joakim regarding this tomorrow?).
- Eirik and Hilde will look at the project description.
- Travel visas: We should fix this asap. Do this by the end of the week? Post on Slack when you have done it? iGEM can provide documentation if needed. CHECK YOUR PASSPORT - maybe it expiers and you need a new one.
- Visa application (Norwegian): http://www.esta.us/norsk.html
- Use slack for communication.
- We need to update the social media channels!
- Meetup with NTNU - maybe in Trondheim sometime in the first week of August. Maybe bad timing? Make a doodle.
- Make a short bio about ourself and send to it Aman. He will make a format and we will use that.
- If you do not have access to the calendar talk to Hilde (give her an email she can add).
Minutes 28.06.17
Agenda 28.06.17 Presentation and feedback
Summary of the sfGFP sequence alignments
- Currently our sfGFP DNA sequence doesn't seem to exist in the registry. This means we can submit it if I'm not mistaken? As a modified or new part?
-Talk to Sandra in regards to what parts need to be used, and if she has any terminators or promoters that can be useful to submit. S. Pombe is slightly different from S. Cerevisiae after all. Should cover most bases on parts? - Amino acid alignments necessary. Someone needs to do this asap. Not fun, but necessary.
3 - Meeting with OsloTech tomorrow What to do, what to expect? What can we ask for? Oslo Innovation Week? Need to put particular focus on the laser setup, as that's the biggest roadblock right now. Other sponsors are also relevant. What else do we need? Mol.bio-stuff? 4 - Script Can and Aman made a really nifty script for searching through the parts distributions and finding parts with relevant keywords. Is put up on git, could be useful to develop further and talk to other teams about it. Perhaps this is something we could collaborate with another team on? 5 - Mol.bio-work Finalize things with Sandra, then start asap. We also need to make some sort of plan for the InterLab. 6 - Misc?
Minutes 12.07.17
Updates since last

Minutes 11.09.17
- labwork is going fine. We can transform yeast cells now, so let's contact Sandra @canht @dejanica
- Eric asked if we should take the project a step further once we manage to do everything we've done thus far; I suggest trying to repress the nmt1-promoter and test it both in a regular spectrophotometer and in our laser to see the results. Kills several birds with one stone; more results, better nmt1-documentation, and we get to test the setup
- Waiting for replies from Joakim when it comes to mirrors; this will probably work out just fine after all. Crisis averted
- Helene and Elisabeth will start working on a poster design. Helene and Eirik will fix the presentation. We MIGHT get tickets, we just need to fix some stuff with Hotswap
- Wiki getting updated and it's looking sweeeeeet
- Still lacking ideas for NTNU-collab

Minutes 25.09.17
Mol. bio. laboratory updates
- The PCR did not work, haven't checked the stuff made this weekend.
- Need to check if the Gibson did work. If not go for plan B and talk to Sandra.
Physics updates
- Setup works
- Wait for mirrors
- Could clearly see that one of the samples did not work
Cutting Edge
- Tomorrow!
- Poster, printing today.
- Sadly no presentation.
- Need to set up the stuff today before 11 pm.
- Postersession from 11 am to 17.30. When are people free to do a postersession?
Collaborations
- NTNU: we need to finish our yeast vector and get a protocol
- Leuven practice jamboree: final decision on this. Sadly we do not have time.
Other stuff
- Wiki sitdown this weekend
Minutes 02.10.17
There's less than a month until the wiki freeze now; we need to put is as much time as humanly possible.
to do, molecular biology
-Clone everything into submission vectors and submit them. cyc1 is already in it's vector. Now we need to do the same for nmt1 and sfGFP as well.
-New batch of composite part arrives this week (hopefully). In the meantime we're transforming the yeast at Sandra's lab with an existing protein. Dejana fixing this later today. Need someone at the lab pretty much every day.
- We'll likely get some stuff from NTNU relatively soon, as well. They'll send protocols. This is a pretty important point for collaboration.
- What Eirik said.
to do, physics
- Worked on the wiki on Sunday, Thorlabs is sending the mirrors and filters now so we will hopefully have the setup ready for when the yeast is ready.
wiki-workshop(s)
-We're having a workshop this Wednesday, but we'll probably need to do these pretty often going forwards, maybe even once a week. We just need to write stuff now.
- Agreed, at least once a week.
Minutes 09.10.17
- nmt1 cloning underway, cyc1 is done, composite part and sfGFP still needs to be cloned into both their vectors
- Yeast cells short lived? Needs more planning. We should also ask WHY they're so short lived
- Thorlabs incoming in a few days, yeast needs to be timed properly
- Everyone needs to write stuff for the wiki. We'll assign different tasks to different people by the week. If you want to write on anything in particular, inform as early as possible (or even better, start writing on it
- We're starting t-shirt design now. Everyone at the meeting voted on which logo to use, and decided on the one Hilde designed. We'll get sponsors to pay for this
- Wiki. Write stuff. Shows up twice because this is really fucking important. Aman will organize workshops each week from now. We should aim to be over 80% done when there's a week left.
Minutes 16.10.17
This meeting was pretty short, so the minutes are pretty much as follows:
- We'll try to do A3-cloning on the composite part, and clone the sfGFP and nmt1 into submission vectors in paralell. The yeast cells should be done pretty soon
- Wiki stuff: mostly what I said yesterday, but everyone also needs to add what they've done to the attributions-page
- Someone needs to take responsibility for getting vectorized graphics for the t-shirts, and then ordering them. Suggested Elisabeth for this
Minutes 23.10.17
Agenda 23.10.17 Last week!
- We're nearly at the finish line, and there's still quite a bit of work left.
- As such, we NEED to devote as much time as possible to the project for the few remaining days. The key parts are related to the wiki and the remaining labwork, so that's where we should spend our energy.
-If anyone's unsure of what to do, PLEASE ASK rather than feeling confused and not doing anything because of that. Again, we need to spend the little time we have remaining effectively. Regardless, everyone should be trying to contribute as much as possible to either the wiki or the labwork now. One, the other, or preferably both.
Remaining labwork
- cyc1 is done, nmt1 is complete when we get the sequencing data. We should still ship these to iGEM HQ today.
- Gonna check if the composite part gibson worked. If it didn't, we'll be making new plasmids with overhangs and try to clone it into those. Primers should arrive today, Eric will fix it. We NEED to start this. If we manage to get it into pJK148 and clone it before the wiki freeze, that'll be a HUGE boon for our project. I can't stress this enough; this is super-important.
- Gibson cloning on the sfGFP. This hasn't happened yet, unfortunately, and we need to do this. Should be started instantly after this meeting is done.
- Hallvard is making some more yeast, if I'm not mistaken?
- More measurement done for the physics part to check for lasing? Someone update
- NTNU collaboration: needs to start today. Four day protocol, but really simple and not really time consuming.
Remaining stuff on the wiki
- Most of the text has been written already, which is good.
-We still have a bunch of lacking content and fine-tuning left, however. Because of this, we'll do tuning and fixing for now until Wednesday, when we'll ask all the supervisors to look through what we've done thus far and provide feedback. We'll do this for every second day remaining until the actual wiki freeze, to ensure we get feedback and get that stuff fixed as soon as possible.
- Also, the text obviously needs to be actually added to the wiki, too. We should have more wiki get-togethers. As many as possible, in fact. Aman, set this up?
- images. We have a bunch of them. Upload them (check upload requirements) and we'll get them in. Look at how past wikis have done this if you want suggestions on how to actually use the images
- references. There's a HUGE bunch of these and they need to be added. Just do this. It goes relatively quick and is really really really fucking important. Don't worry about referencing style; getting this consistent and functional is one of the last things we'll do before the freeze, we just need the actual references. I think Helene has a list of referencing material we can use.
- Work documentation: this is a bit tricky. We have the notebook page, but it never got used, so I think we should scrap it and rethink it. Everyone wrote yellow notes on what they did some time back; add this to what you've done. We'll figure out a way to organize this once everyone has done so. I'll provide a dummy file as suggestion for how to fix this.
- Labwork / results: we have the text, we just need to organize this. The protocols should be separate from the results.
- Stuff I've forgotten: PLEASE INFORM ME
