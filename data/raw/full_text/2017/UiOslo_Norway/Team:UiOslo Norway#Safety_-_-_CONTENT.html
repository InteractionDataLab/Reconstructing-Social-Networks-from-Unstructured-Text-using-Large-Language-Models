A biosafety level (BSL) is a collection of biocontainment measures required to isolate dangerous biological materials in an enclosed laboratory facility. The grades of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 0 (BSL-0) to the highest at level 4 (BSL-4).

A <B>genetically modified organism </B>(GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been modified using genetic engineering methods (i.e., a genetically modified organism). GMOs are used nowadays to produce variety of medications and also a more challenging area; genetically modified foods (GMF). It is also used in scientific research and production of other goods.

For this end, these procedures must be fulfilled before, during and at the end of Lab work:

 Lab hazards can bear risk to your health and GMOs can potentially affect environmental health/balance.
It is essential that lab workers to be aware regarding safety precautions and safe removal before/during/after lab work. All students at the UiO should receive HSE training specialized to the faculty they belong to. These are mandatory courses starting up during the first weeks of every semester. This kind of training ensures that all students, as well as other members of the working environment, have the necessary training to perform for their duties and fulfill their responsibilities put forward by their work.
<A href="http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/kjemi/HMS0503/index-eng.html"> More info </A>

Moreover, a customized training also was set up for the whole team before initiation of project at BSL2 and BSL1 labs respectively, conducted by Lab Managers: Professor Dirk Linke, Professor Sandra Lopez Avilez and Ninna... Anders Moien assisted us as the safety advisor from the department of Bioscience in this project. This customized training by supervisors covered these headlines: <UL><LI>appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) </LI><LI>proper waste disposal </LI><LI>and risk assessment </LI>
Also, two mandatory act  was determined by supervisors in the time of working at BSL2:
</UL><UL><LI>Laboratory work: Minimum two people, Maximum four </LI><LI>Laboratory work: Working under supervision of at least one instructor all the times</LI></UL><H3>Research ethics</H3>

University of Oslo (UiO)  keeps a strong focus on research ethics. For this end,  It  has prepared a plan of action for preventing academic dishonesty and providing a positive environment. 

A researcher have a responsibility to comply his/her work according to:

standards of good research practice 
established scientific and ethical principles
 In this way UiO aims to  research ethics and research safety together. Oslo iGEM team 2017 was committed to proceed their project in accordance with the mentioned criteria and official ethical guidelines approved by University of Oslo.
