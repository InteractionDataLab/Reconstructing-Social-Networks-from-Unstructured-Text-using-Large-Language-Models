In both courses, I am equally fascinated by the freedom and the range of opportunities that these young research areas bring with them. I am convinced that interdisciplinary competences are crucial for solving scientific problems.
                                <B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>For me, the iGEM competition offers the special opportunity to work together with a team of motivated students from different disciplines and to carry out an interdisciplinary project in independent work. With this holistic approach, from finding sponsors through public relations to international scientific exchange, it is thus possible to use and expand competences that go beyond the content of the study.
                                <B>What are you passionate about?</B>In my free time I like to work on scientifically and technically challenging projects. I am currently working on the implementation of an interactive media table.

								<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>iGEM offers the unique opportunity to solve a problem in a highly motivated team using synthetic biology. The competition challenges the teams to organize, plan, and complete a project from start to finish. The combination of management, team- and labwork fascinates me and motivates me to participate in the iGEM competition.

We learn how organisms work on the lowest level and use this knowledge to solve problems. Without computer science this wouldn't be possible, so the different fields of science have to be combined. Not only the search for the most efficient algorithm is in my interest, but also the understanding of genes and their function.
											<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>The unique chance to solve world problems with a team of motivated students is very special. The commercial benefit is not important, which is why we could put any idea into practice. And the most interesting aspect is that we can solve all these problems with synthetic biology.

It is the first time that I can bring my specific acquired skills into a bigger team. I am happy about starting a complete new project beyond my regular studies. It is awesome to create our own project with the team.

Then in school, I learned about microbiological systems, which completely changed my perception of life, ecosystems, and the whole world. The more I learned about biological systems, the more I became interested in comprehensive biological processes and in possible applications for humanity and nature. My aim in the future is to work on environmentally friendly processes. This is why I decided to study molecular biotechnology.

I now wish to expand my ability to analyze, visualize, and interpret biological data.
											<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>I was inspired to join the iGEM-Competition because it enables students from various field to share and broaden their knowledge in order to plan, conduct, and present their very own research project. I was especially intrigued by the idea to tackle a humanitarian or environmental project by means of synthetic biology.
											<B>What motivates you to do your best?</B>I do my best, whenever the effort makes one learn something new. It does not matter whether new findings are trivial or world-shaking, as long as the newfound knowledge shape ones future endeavors.

Using organisms in different ways to create something new or to optimize outdated procedures enables us to, among other things, correct mistakes which mankind has done to nature.
											<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>I would like to tackle the challenge of independently working on a project from start to finish as part of a team. I especially like that, additionally to the lab work, we also get to plan and coordinate other tasks that the iGEM competition entails in order to reach our common goal. Apart from interacting with sponsors and designing our website, we use different social media and maintain international contacts to other teams. Thus, we consistently receive feedback and gain impressions of our project from different perspectives. This helps us promote our work and to constantly improve it.
											<B>What motivates you to do your best?</B>I wish to achieve something useful in my future work. In synthetic biology, I see great potential for finding solutions to current problems. Therefore, I would like to learn as much as possible during this competition in order to be able to use this knowledge for future works.

Here I see the opportunity to deepen my knowledge and skills in various fields of science, such as physics, computer science and chemistry, and to recombine what I have learned.
											<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>In the competition, I am able to plan, develop and carry out a project independently in a team of young students. We are aware of the full scope of scientific work - with its ups and downs - and in the end we present our own work in the hope of shaping the future. I do not want to miss this experience.

In the meantime I am fascinated by the versatile applications and the benefits for many medical and biological questions and research questions.
											<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>With respect to the competition, I was especially fascinated by the opportunity to work independently and also in a team on a self-determined project. 
											<B>What motivates you to do your best?</B>If something interests me, I want to pull through to the end and give it all to make it work. In general it is important to me to never give up so that I can proudly say that I have fought for something. In addition, I think that you can only learn something and really make new experiences if you are really into it. And that is, in my opinion, only possible if you give your best.

It is also fascinating to discover their function and classify them with respect to their various pathways.
											<B>Why are you participating in the iGEM-Competition 2017?</B>To me, the competition is a form of activity-based learning. Through independent planning of our project – from our first ideas through research until financing – its multidisciplinarity, and the diversity of this years’ team, I am excited to master many new abilities and contribute to the project with my own knowledge.
											<B>What motivates you to do your best?</B>As an upcoming researcher, I am of course motivated by the great results and accomplishments of other researchers. They and my own achievements are a big incentive for me. To see other people passionately giving their best is a strong motivator for me to also give my best.
