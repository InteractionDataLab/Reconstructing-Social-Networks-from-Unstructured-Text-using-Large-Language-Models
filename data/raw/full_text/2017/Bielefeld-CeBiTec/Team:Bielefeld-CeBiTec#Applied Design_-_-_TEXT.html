Short summary
Terminus independent specific fusion of two or more peptides is a major challenge in synthetic biology and beyond.     Inspired by the highly specific condensation reaction of D‑luciferin from the firefly Photinus pyralis, we came up     with a sophisticated solution, combining organic chemistry, computational modelling, and molecular biology. Based on     our own design, we synthesized the novel synthetic amino acid Nγ‑cyanobenzothiazolyl‑L‑asparagine‑(CBT‑asparagine).     The cyano group of CBT‑asparagine undergoes a condensation reaction with the 1,2‑aminothiol group of Nε‑L‑cysteinyl‑L‑lysine (CL).     Through in silico simulation, we predicted different aminoacyl tRNA synthetase sequences to incorporate CBT‑asparagine into     proteins of interest. This system offers a new way for the production of fusion proteins and polymerized polypeptides.
Searching for Interesting Non-Canonical Amino Acids
During our search for interesting non‑canonical amino acids which we could use for our project, we found CL. It was first synthesized     and described by Nguyen et al. (2011). It is proposed that CL enables the highly specific binding between peptides and ligands containing     a cyanobenzothiazole residue. CL itself consists of L‑cysteine coupled by its carboxy group to the amino group of the side chain of     L‑lysine. As a result, it contains a free 1,2‑aminothiol group at its side chain. According to the highly specific condensation reaction     of 1,2‑aminothiols and cyanobenzothiazole‑derivatives (CBT-derivatives), which is common for the biosynthesis of D‑Luciferin (see Figure     1), the substrate of the firefly luciferase of P. pyralis, CL can undergo the same condensation reaction with CBT‑derivatives (see     Figure 2).
Figure 1: Synthesis of D‑Luciferin.
The 1,2‑aminothiol group of D‑cysteine and the     6‑hydroxybenzothiazole‑2‑carbonitrile undergo the condensation reaction under physiological conditions to build D‑luciferin     (Liang et al., 2010).
Figure 2: The condensation reaction of CL and a CBT‑derivative.
The 1,2‑aminothiol group     of the side chain of CL and the cyano group of the CBT‑derivative undergo the same condensation reaction under physiological conditions     like D‑cysteine and 6‑hydroxybenzothiazole‑2‑carbonitrile.
So far, CL was used to label proteins with CBT‑derivatives bound to fluorescent chemicals and proteins. Inspired by the rapid and     highly specific condensation reaction which takes place under physiological conditions, we thought about a possibility to synthesize     a novel amino acid which enables the highly specific binding between peptides using CBT as a side chain and CL as the counterpart.
Designing a Novel Amino Acid
To synthesize a novel amino acid, we needed the right reagents for the reaction. First, it was important to find a CBT‑derivative     which could be coupled to the side chain of a canonical amino acid. To use common methods of peptide synthesis, we needed two     educts one containing a free carboxy group and one containing a free amino group. There are different canonical amino acids containing     one of these two groups at their side chains. All canonical eligible amino acids with a free amino group at their side chain are lysine,     asparagine and glutamine. Because of the long carbon chain at the side chain of lysine it would be too difficult to generate a well     working aminoacyl‑tRNA synthetase for a novel amino acid consisting of lysine and a CBT‑derivative. To get an amino acid as small as     possible containing a CBT-derivative at its side chain, asparagine and its derivative aspartic acid which contains a free carboxy group     at its side chain were the best choices for an educt for the synthesis of a novel amino acid. As CBT-derivative we chose     6‑amino‑2‑cyanobenzothiazole (ACBT) which has a free amino group at its benzene ring (see Figure 3). Its free amino group ACBT     requires an aspartic acid for the coupling reaction to synthesize the novel amino acid.
Figure 3: Structure of ACBT.
The amino group at the benzene ring can be used for the     coupling reaction and the cyano group at the thiazole ring enables the condensation reaction.
Synthesizing a Novel Amino Acid
Due to the high price of ACBT, we synthesized it first on ourselves using 2‑chloro‑6‑nitrobenzothiazole (Cl-NBT) as educt. According     to Hauser et al. (2016), we produced ACBT by the nucleophilic substitution of the chlorine atom with a cyano group and the reduction of     the nitro group to an amino group. Figure 4 shows the schematic synthesis of ACBT with Cl‑NBT as the educt.
Figure 4: Schematic synthesis of ACBT with Cl‑NBT as the educt.
First, the chlorine atom of the     Cl‑NBT is substituted with a cyano group (i) to give 6‑nitrobenzothiazole‑2‑carbonitrile (NBT‑CN). The second step is the reduction     of the nitro group of NBT‑CN to an amino group (ii) resulting in ACBT.
With ACBT and N‑Fmoc‑aspartic acid‑OAllyl ester we could synthesize the novel amino acid CBT‑asparagine.     Figure 5 and 6 show the two steps of the synthesis.
Figure 5: Schematic coupling reaction of ACBT and N‑Fmoc‑aspartic acid‑OAllyl ester.
Due to the     protecting groups, only the carboxy group of N‑Fmoc‑aspartic acid‑OAllyl ester can react with the amino group of ACBT. Using isobutyl     chloroformate and 4‑methylmorpholine enables the coupling reaction.
Figure 6: Deprotection of N‑Fmoc‑CBT‑asparagine‑OAllyl ester.
By adding 3x the equivalent of morpholine to     the protected N‑Fmoc‑CBT‑asparagine‑OAllyl ester, we could directly remove both protecting groups resulting in the free form of the novel     amino acid CBT-asparagine.
With the novel amino acid CBT‑asparagine and the CL we provide a new way of rapid highly specific binding of peptides and enzymes     under physiological conditions. First in vitro tests show that the condensation reaction     between CBT‑asparagine and CL (see Figure 7) takes place.
Figure 7: Schematic condensation reaction of CL and CBT‑asparagine.
The natural     condensation reaction of 1,2‑aminothiols and 6‑hydroxybenzothiazole‑2‑carbonitrile provides a new way to produce fusion proteins and polymer peptides by binding both amino acids.
Modeling New Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases by in silico Simulation
Additionally, we generated several new aminoacyl‑tRNA synthetases based on the tyrosyl‑tRNA synthetase of Methanococcus jannaschii using the protein design software ROSETTA. Preliminary tests indicate that the modeled synthetases K2201300 , K2201301 , and K2201302 are able to incorporate CBT‑asparagine (for     further information visit our modeling page ). Further tests are needed to    evluate these results. Following figure shows CBT‑asparagine in the binding site of the synthetase K2201300 (Figure 8).

Conclusion
We provide a new way to produce fusion proteins and polymerized peptides using the terminus independent, rapid and highly specific     binding ability of CL and the novel amino acid CBT‑asparagine. With this method, it is possible to fuse peptides and enzymes using     an environmentally friendly condensation reaction which is inspired by natural systems.
