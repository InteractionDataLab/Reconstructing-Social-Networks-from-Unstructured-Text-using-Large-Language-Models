Experiments described in our wiki were carried out by members of the iGEM team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2017 (see members page for details). Some very specific analyses were supported by other scientists from Bielefeld University, but executed by team members. In very few cases, we used commercial services for routine tasks like DNA synthesis, oligonucleotide synthesis or Sanger sequencing of parts (Sequencing Core Facility, CeBiTec, Bielefeld, Germany).
We would like to thank everyone who supported our project. An ambitious project like this would have been hard to complete without support from all over the world. During our research, every member of our team gained unique skills and knowledge from several experts listed below. Their expertise helped us to generate a sophisticated toolbox and to demonstrate its functionality.
General Support
Prof. Dr. Jörn Kalinowski (1stPI) gave us the opportunity to participate in iGEM by providing us with our own laboratory and the resources of his group.
Dr. Christian Rückert (2ndPI) participated in our weekly team meetings and helped us with advice and assistance.
Prof. Dr. Kristian Müller (2ndPI) supported us with advice and equipment.
Julian Droste (advisor) and Boas Pucker (advisor): Special thanks to our advisors for supporting and encouraging us to realize all our ideas. Many supervisors would have advised us to choose an easier project or to focus only on a small part. Thank you so much for your input and the freedom you gave us for our research.
Experts
Prof. Dr. Nediljko Budisa supported us with his expertise in the aaRS evolution and even invited us to work on our project in his lab at the TU Berlin.
We would like to thank Huan Sun and Fabian Schildhauer for all the help, advice, and supervision in Berlin concerning the amino acyl-tRNA synthtase selections. Thank you for the interesting conversations and the great opportunity to benefit from your experience.
Dr. Florian Richter helped us a lot with his knowledge about ROSETTA and supported our modeling team getting used to working with ROSETTA.
Iker Valle Aramburu, predoctoral fellow at the EMBL Heidelberg, supported us with his expertise in labeling non-canonical amino acids and attended at our conference about "Expanding the Genetic Code".
Prof. Dr. Thomas Carell offered feedback during the early stages of our project. He also named additional experts for specific parts of our projects, which we consequently contacted.
We thank Vitor Panheiro and Piet Herdewijn for the very helpful skype interview.
Achim Müller advised us to think about problems concerning heat production and gave us important input to improve heat dissipation and reduce voltage drop in our circuit design.
Dr. Risto Kõiva gave important information on circuit board design rules and checked the final design for errors.
Melanie Schwarz helped us by discussing limitations and potentials of oligonucleotides with unnatural bases with us.
We want to thank Prof. Raul Machedo for his conceptional advice on how to build a plasmid with repetitive gene sequences e.g. silk elastin like proteins.
Material, Constructional and Analytical Support
The group Microbial Genomics and Biotechnology allowed us to use their laboratories and equipment and showed great patience when we occupied many of the facilities.
We would like to thank the Sequencing Core Facility at the CeBiTec for sequencing all our parts.
Dr. Sandip Jadhav, Dr. Marcel Frese and Prof. Dr. Norbert Sewald:Many thanks for helping us during the synthesis of our own non-canonical amino acids. Without your lab and supervising this part would have been difficult to accomplish.
Prof. Dr. Dario Anselmetti from the biophysics and nanoscience group provided us with equipment and expertise to enable biophysical analysis.
Dr. Thorsten Seidel from the dynamic cell imaging group helped us with the fluorescence microscope and his expertise in bio imaging and the FRET system.
Prof. Dr. Dirk Lütkemeyer, Dr. Benjamin Müller, Prof. Dr. Thomas Noll and Ole Weigelt supported us with encouragement and tips regarding the new chromatography method including the light-induced elution.
Dr. Vera Ortseifen and Julia Voss assisted us in preparing and measuring samples for the protein identification via MALDI-TOF/TOF.
The botanical garden Marburg maintained by the University of Marburg kindly allowed us to collect tissue samples from Croton tiglium and provided us with our own plant for the conservatory at Bielefeld University.
We thank Willy Keller from the Genome Research group for his kind support with RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisin preparation of our RNA-Seq experiments.
Marcus Persicke and Matthias Ruwe adviced us with the HPLC.
We would like to thank Thomas Bayer for his help regarding the western blots.
Jenny Fjodorova from the biophysics and nanoscience group helped us imaging Sup35 using atomic force microscopy (AFM).
Human Practices Support
We want to thank Prof. R. Alta Charo, Prof. Sune Holm, Stefan Wolf, Dr. med. Hansjörg Heußlein, Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Heinrichs, Prof. Ulrich Krohs, Cemil Sahinöz, and Prof. Dr. Kathryn Nixdorff. They answered our questions concerning bioethics for the ChImp Report and supported and encouraged us with their expertise. Thank you so much!
