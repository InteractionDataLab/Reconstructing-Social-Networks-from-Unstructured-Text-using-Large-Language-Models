The Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec) is a central scientific institution at Bielefeld University, dedicated to interdisciplinary research in life sciences, and one of the largest organizations on campus. It is a place to encourage and support innovative scientific projects that cross discipline boundaries. The main fields of research are Large Scale Genomics, Big Data Bioinformatics, and Metabolic Engineering of Unicellular Systems and Bioproduction. For this purpose, it consolidates research activities in the fields of biotechnology, molecular biology, genome research, systems biology and biochemistry, as well as bioinformatics and computer science. The CeBiTec also fosters academic training and PhD programs and serves as a "think tank" with regards to activities in the field of biotechnology. It is located on the campus of Bielefeld University, in the new laboratory building G, inaugurated in 2007.
