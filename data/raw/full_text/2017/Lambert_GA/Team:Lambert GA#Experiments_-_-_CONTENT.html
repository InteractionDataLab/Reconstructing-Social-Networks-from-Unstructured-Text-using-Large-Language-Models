The 2017 Lambert iGEM team worked two-fold on developing a proof of concept for the Chrome-Q and assembling a genetic construct to use the Chrome-Q to quantify data.
In the process of advancing the Chrome-Q, there were three methods in which Lambert iGEM attempted to grow E. coli expressing color for data collection. 
</P><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
Several weeks were devoted to construct pλR LacI R011 RFP in the NEB 10-beta E. coli strain, with individual parts given from Monica McNerney at the Georgia Institute of Technology. However, the lack of RFP expression in the cells led the team to believe that the sequences - particularly RFP - were mutated when attempting to digest and ligate the parts together.
</P><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
Next, the team referred to the parts registry to use existing chromoproteins. From Uppsala 2013, Lambert iGEM attempted to ligate AmilCP (BBa_K592009), Amaj Lime (BBa_K1033916), and CJ Blue (BBa_K592011) into backbones to obtain a variety of measurements on the Chrome-Q using the HSV color space. After adjusting digestion, ligation, and transformation protocols and still failing to see the expected color expression, the team referred back to Stanford-Brown’s wiki page on their usage of the chromoproteins for their project in 2016. It was discovered that their team also did not successfully transform those chromoproteins; as a result, they had ordered their parts to obtain their results.
</P><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
Subsequently, to troubleshoot for both the RFP construct and Uppsala’s chromoproteins, Lambert iGEM ordered chromoproteins from ATUM: TinselPurple, ScroogeOrange, and VirginiaViolet. While the two purple chromoproteins (TinselPurple and VirginiaViolet) gave a variance of the color, ScroogeOrange provided a contrasting pigment for the Chrome-Q to measure. After successful transformations, liquid cultures were induced with varying levels of IPTG - 0uM, 10uM, 100uM, 500uM, and 1mM. Distinct visual differences were observed: incremental concentrations of IPTG directly correlated with an increase in chromoprotein expression. Measurements were made on the spectrophotometer and the Chrome-Q for comparison. </P><CENTER><I style="font-size: 16px; color: white;">Successful Transformations of ATUM chromoproteins (ScroogeOrange and TinselPurple)</I></CENTER><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
Additionally, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team continued attempting a similar construct to the 2016 Lambert iGEM team: pλR LacI tsPurple/tsPurpleDAS/tsPurpleLAA pLac ClpXP CI. DAS (a moderate degradation tag) and LAA (a strong degradation tag) allowed rates of degradation to be compared when measuring the RGB values of the cells on the Chrome-Q.
The promoter, pλR LacI, had very low miniprep concentrations, and it was hypothesized that the toxicity to the cells prevented from both transformation and miniprep efficiencies to be proficient for the rest of the assemblies. As a result, the team switched to R0040, a promoter that was transformed from this year’s InterLab study. This was successfully ligated to the three reporters, but the colonies did not turn purple when transformed in the NEB 5-alpha E. coli strain and the Keio strains.
</P><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
For the reporters alone, sequencing results showed that both tsPurple and tsPurpleLAA had the correct part length, but tsPurpleDAS did not include the degradation tag in its sequencing result. As a result, the team contributed these new composite parts to the iGEM registry.
</P><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
The final third of the construct - pLac ClpXP CI - was successfully assembled and sent for sequencing, which revealed that CI had been mutated during assembly and therefore not functional. Due to time constraints, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team did not have time to put together the entire construct.
</P><P style="text-indent: 50px; font-size:20px;">
While characterizing non-lysosomal inducible protein degradation, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team developed the Chrome-Q to quantify the degradation of different chromoproteins.

The app was developed for mobile Android devices and will soon be available for iOS devices. A photo is taken (within the app) of the Chrome-Q dome target base (that contains the rows of samples in triplicate). The app finds the samples in the photo by looking for low luminance values compared to the high luminance values in the white background. Then, the app finds the average hue and luminance for each sample by averaging the RGB values for all of the pixels in the circular sample. It groups the samples into rows by comparing their vertical locations in the photo. After grouping into rows, it calculates the average RGB values for the entire row to generate an average hue and luminance for the triplicate. The average hue and luminance are utilized to calculate the standard deviation of the triplicate. By looking at the standard deviation, it was determined that the hue values were most consistent in the triplicate. These values can then be used to compare relative levels of degradation between the different constructs (tsPurple, tsPurpleDAS, and tsPurpleLAA). Chrome-Q system methodology can be found in the Model page.
