Engineering Design Principles
Lambert iGEM used engineering design principles to modify their project. In order to improve the Chrome-Q, the team consulted with Mr. Gibson, the CEO and founder of Gibson Ridge Software. After receiving feedback, the team applied new changes to the Chrome-Q in order to fix previous mistakes. This correlates with the Engineering Principles because they were able to change certain aspects of the device based on error analysis.
Maker Faire
The Lambert iGEM team attended and presented at Maker Faire in Atlanta, Georgia. The team introduced the project to people of all ages, specifically focusing on protein degradation and quantifying data using a new device they constructed called the Chrome-Q. After describing the overview of the project, they asked the public, “Why is biology important to you?”

Call with Dr. Saad Bhamla
Lambert iGEM discussed their progress with the PaperFuge in the project with Dr. Saad Bhamla, a new Georgia Tech professor who was a part of the Prakash Lab at Stanford University. Dr. Bhamla also assisted with some details so the team could improve their own device, the Chrome-Q, to be more fundamental. The progress with these low-cost appliances help contribute to underfunded labs.
Femme in STEM
As a part of the Women in STEM club led by iGEM members, the team prepared a brunch called “Femme in STEM.” This brunch allowed both teachers and students at Lambert High School to delve more into fields in STEM without feeling restricted due to gender roles in society. Lambert iGEM also was able to discuss their project this year to promote iGEM and biotechnology at the high school.
