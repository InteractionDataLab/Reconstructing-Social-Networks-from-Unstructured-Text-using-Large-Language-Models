My name is Nithik Balachandran, and this is my first year on the iGEM team, and I am already loving the experience. I love getting to work with the Hardware and Fundraising/Marketing teams, and also enjoy working on the wiki. Aside from iGEM, my favorite things to do are watch sports, play sports, travel, and code.</DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Katie Barr </B><I> Junior </I> Hello! This is my first year on an iGEM team! iGEM has taught me critical thinking skills, time management, teamwork and how to get 8 hours of sleep in 4 hours (Seriously we are in the lab at 6:30am). I love to challenge myself mentally and physically. So when I finally leave the lab, I spend my time cheering for an Allstar team. I am super grateful for the techniques I’ve learned and the family I’ve gained by joining this team.  </DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Gaurav Byagathvalli </B><I> Junior </I> Hi! My name is Gaurav, and this is my first year on the iGEM Team. Being a part of iGEM has given me the opportunity to effectively apply my science knowledge into a project with real-word applications, and has provided me with the dedication, determination, and hard work one needs in order to be successful. I am thankful to be a part of this open science community and to have incredible team members who I work alongside with everyday. I hope to be able to implement the knowledge I gain from iGEM into a career in medicine and research. In addition to iGEM, I share a unique enthusiasm for politics, basketball, and music (piano). </DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV><CENTER><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Noora Chandasir </B><I> Senior </I> Hey all! My name is Noora Chandasir and I am a senior at Lambert High School on the iGEM team. iGEM has been an incredible opportunity to be a part of. The experiences I have gained by being on this team have allowed me to learn and approach synthetic biology in a completely different way. I have learned so much! Outside of iGEM, I enjoy traveling, hiking, soccer (go Bayern!), skiing, reading, and following politics. In the future, I hope to become part of Doctors Without Borders and serve as an advocate for human rights. I can’t wait to see everyone at Jamboree again with their world-changing projects!
</DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Alyssa Franklin </B><I> Senior </I> This is my third year on iGEM. I am grateful for the opportunity iGEM grants me to express my passion and gain experience in the career I wish to pursue: genetics. Outside of the lab, I enjoy running cross country and track, dancing, and reading, as well as traveling.
</DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Emily Gibson </B><I> Senior </I>Though this is just my first year as a member of iGEM, it has already been one of the most incredible, demanding, and inspiring experiences of my entire life. I’ve been pushed to exceed every expectation I’ve had for myself and then some! But that isn’t to say I don’t have fun; in my free time I love to go to concerts, travel, devour books, and nerd out over all things pop culture. At the Jamboree you’ll most likely find me checking out every presentation I can see, talking to as many people as possible, or wherever there is chocolate. </DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV><CENTER><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb" style="width:300px;"><B> Megan Hong </B><I> Sophomore </I>This is my first year in iGEM, and I can positively say that I have never been more excited to go on a school field trip than now. Besides working in the lab, I like to run around a grass field with twenty-one other people who are trying to get to the same ball, pull horse hair over metal to make some hopefully pleasant noise, and pour my ideas and experiences into writing short stories. I can't wait to meet new people and learn about everyone's projects at Jamboree!
 </DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Lauren Hong </B><I> Senior </I>Hello everyone!! My name is Lauren Hong, and I am currently a senior at Lambert High School in Suwanee, Georgia. A dinosaur on the Lambert iGEM team, I've roamed the lands of our lab for the past four years. It has been an incredible journey exploring various applications of research to real-world problems through the lens of synthetic biology; as a result of my positive experiences with this team, I hope to pursue medical research as a biomedical engineer. Outside the jungle known as our classroom and lab space, I am a passionate soccer player itching to get back to the field and an enthusiast of the violin and classical music. I'm excited to be returning to the Giant Jamboree for the last time in my high school career and meeting all of you and your projects!
</DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Ellie Kim</B><I> Junior </I>This is my first year on the iGEM team. iGEM has allowed me to dedicate myself into a place copious with other people that share the same devotion as me gaining the involvement and understanding of valuable research and its capabilities. I have grown to fall in love with science and the people on my team. Alongside iGEM, I like to live spontaneously by meeting new people and traveling.

When I’m not in the lab, you can catch me out on a long run, working at Starbucks, or eating some weird vegan food! In my rare free time, I enjoy traveling, camping, and drinking more coffee than seems humanly possible. </DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="divimage"><CENTER><DIV class="blurb"><B> Kevin Li </B><I> Junior </I>Hey! Glad to see you are remotely interested in who I am. :) I am a current Junior and this is my first year in iGEM (exciting, I know). This team is like a second family to me; all of its members care for each other and wish to see one another succeed. iGEM has also given me countless opportunities in which I can immerse myself in genetic engineering. When you don’t see me buried in a pile of homework or in the lab, I can usually be found in the middle of an episode on Netflix or hanging out with friends.

Along with science she also continues her  pursuit of performing as she strives to become a circus artist and one day attend the national circus school in Montreal. She is a lover of nature, life and fellow humans, and her biggest goal is to spread happiness, love, and knowledge to everyone she meets.

I’m a senior at Lambert High School, a varsity football player (first string), dedicated scout on my way to Eagle, and a wayward student working through the AP grind. I’ve loved science since I was a wee lad, always hanging out in my mother’s classroom playing with her experiments. I love learning about new breakthroughs in science, and am always quick with an interesting fact. And last but not least, I am well versed in a wide variety of accents including Scottish, Irish, British, Russian, Smeagol/Gollum, Southern, and Philly.
