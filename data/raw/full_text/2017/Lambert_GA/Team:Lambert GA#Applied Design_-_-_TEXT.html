In underfunded labs, researchers struggle to produce accurate results due to the lack of equipment available to them. Lambert iGEM’s Chrome-Q was designed to analyze bacterial samples at a low cost. The hardware is paired with a software app that quantifies the color expression in HSV value, which is similar to the function of a plate reader that detect fluorescence. Since the Chrome-Q is 3-D printed plastic, the total cost is around $100.00 US dollars. To add, the app is free to the public and is accessible to Android cellphones. In contrast, a plate reader costs upwards of $12,000 US dollars. Therefore, Lambert iGEM’s Chrome-Q and app are a low-cost alternative for underfunded labs.
