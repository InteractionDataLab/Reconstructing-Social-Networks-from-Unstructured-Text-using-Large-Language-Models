BBa_K2353000: tsPurple
BBa_K2353001: tsPurpleDAS
BBa_K2353002: tsPurpleLAA
The middle part of the full three part construct is one of three tsPurple sequences. Each sequence is composed of BBa_B0034 (RBS) and BBa_K1033906 (tsPurple- a purple chromoprotein also known as TinselPurple). When assembled with p-lambda-r LacI and pLac-ClpXP-CI, the tsPurple constructs are expressed by p-lambda-r LacI. The terminator for tsPurple is located at the beginning of the pLac-ClpXP-CI sequence, before the promoter for ClpXP-CI. When the construct is fully assembled and induced with IPTG, ClpXP is expressed and causes degradation when there is a degradation tag attached at the end of the tsPurple construct. BBa_K2353000, the tsPurple construct without any degradation tag, shows the baseline expression of tsPurple as a basis for comparison. BBa_K2353001 has degradation tag DAS (BBa_M0052) which should cause moderately fast degradation of tsPurple, while BBa_K2353002 has the degradation tag LAA (BBa_M0050), which should cause high rates of degradation due to the high affinity of ClpXP for LAA.
