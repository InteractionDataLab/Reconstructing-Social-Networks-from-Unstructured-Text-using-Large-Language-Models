Common among all our team members is a passion for synthetic biology and an eagerness to learn more about it while contributing to advance the work done in this field. Having the advantage of being from diverse backgrounds, each of the members has uniquely contributed to our 2017 research project.</P><DIV id="YifeiWang" class="member"><DIV class="popover right" style="margin-top:80px"><H3 class="popover-title"><B>Yifei Wang (Director)</B></H3><DIV class="popover-content"><FONT color="black"><P>Yifei is in his fourth year of Life Sciences. Yifei is the new QGEM Dictator after overthrowing Dragos in a peaceful coup and enjoys bossing the QGEM team around from his SynBio throne. His favourite class at Queen’s was molecular biology, and he hopes to pursue a career that combines SynBio and medicine. Yifei has a burning passion for Metro prepared meals, but hopes to have enough money one day after becoming the CEO of his own biotech startup that he can hire Chef Dee #anotherone. His favourite sports team is the Toronto Raptors, and he hopes that his amateur career as a Roots model will one day allow him to replace Drake as their new courtside celebrity.</P></FONT></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="NolanNeville" class="member"><DIV class="popover right"><H3 class="popover-title"><B>Nolan Neville (Wet Lab Co-Lead)</B></H3><DIV class="popover-content"><FONT color="black"><P>Nolan is in his fourth year of Biochemistry. He is particularly interested in bacteria and the rise of antibiotic resistance, so this year’s biofilm project was right up his alley. When he isn’t running around in the lab or admiring crystal structures, he can be found listening to old Dire Straits records and learning classic rock riffs on his Les Paul. In the future, Nolan hopes to pursue a career in research working to create novel antibiotics.</P></FONT></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="MadyThompson" class="member memberight"><DIV class="popover left" style="margin-top:20px"><H3 class="popover-title"><B>Mady Thompson (Wet Lab Co-Lead)</B></H3><DIV class="popover-content"><FONT color="black"><P>Mady is in her fourth year of Biochemistry.

She hails from Sunnyvale Trailer Park; ask her how the mosquitos are tonight for a guaranteed laugh. When she isn’t in the lab characterizing kinesin proteins, she can be found scouting the halls of Botterell for cute firefighters. Mady also moonlights as a professional basketball player in the lab, so be sure to wear your goggles to protect your eyes from her stray 3-pointers. Mady hopes to one day use her biomaterials engineering skills to make toothpaste less spicy.</P></FONT></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="SarahBabbitt" class="member memberight"><DIV class="popover left" style="margin-top:20px"><H3 class="popover-title"><B>Sarah Babbitt (Dry Lab Lead)</B></H3><DIV class="popover-content"><FONT color="black"><P>Sarah is in her third year of Apple Math.
