This year, Queen’s iGEM Outreach Team directed a three-part interview series to complement our project's focus on novel methods for Arctic oil remediation. These interviews touch on topics of pollution treatment, bioremediation, toxicity of bitumen, and antifreeze proteins, as discussed with experts in chemical engineering, environmental sciences, and molecular biology (Dr. Ramsay, Dr. Hodson, and Dr. Walker respectively). This interview series aims to spark conversations about whether we are taking the right steps towards a future less dependent on oil.
Dr. Juliana Ramsay
Dr. Ramsay is a professor of Chemical Engineering at Queen’s University. Her research projects focus on fermentation and product recovery, pollution treatment, and bioremediation. Thus, QGEM interviewed Dr. Ramsay for her expertise on bioremediation, asking for her thoughts on our project about arctic oil remediation. Dr. Ramsay has contributed to multiple encyclopedias, including the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology.
Background: B.Sc. (Hons), Bacteriology and Immunology, Western University (1979), M.Sc., University of Texas at El Paso (1981),
Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering, McGill University (1987); Supervisors: Dr. Cooper and Dr. Neufeld.
Dr. Peter Hodson
Dr. Hodson is an emeritus professor for the School of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Biology at Queen’s University. Dr. Hodson’s work in environmental studies has impacted industrial regulations. Thus, leading to his status as an invited member of a Royal Society Expert Panel on the behaviour and environmental impacts of crude oil released into aqueous environments.
Background: B.Sc., Physiology, McGill University (1968), M.Sc., Biology, University of New Brunswick  (1970), Ph.D., Zoology, University of Guelph (1974).
Dr. Virginia Walker
Dr. Walker is a professor of the Biology Department at Queen’s University. She is known for both her teaching style and her research, as she has won the Best Lecturer Award (2010) and the Prize for Excellence in Research (2016). Dr. Walker is part of the Towards a Sustainable Fishery for Nunavummuit project, which will provide data for monitoring impacts of future disturbances and climate change. The focus of this interview is on her work on ice-binding proteins.
