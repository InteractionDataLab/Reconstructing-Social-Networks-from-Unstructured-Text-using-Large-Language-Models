Bronze Medal
1.「Registration」
We registered our team, spent a full summer, and plan to enjoy the trip to Massachusetts as well as the Giant Jamboree.
2.「Deliverables」
a. We have set up a team wiki to present our work.

BBa_K592009
BBa_K1033919
d. We submitted our parts to Genscript in China. And they sent the parts by DHL, 2016823992
Silver Medal
1.「BioBricks」
We have designed, built and experimentally validated (5) new functional biobricks and already submitted characterization data to the parts registry page

2.「Collaboration」
We have collaborated with other IGEM teams:
-Offering help to RDFZ_China
-RDFZ_China helped us hand out questionnaires
-Probiotics E. coli Nissle 1917 Shared by BNDS_China
-Discussions about Human Practice part with Tsinghua iGEM team
3.「Safety」
Lab safety: all team members are trained before starting work on our project; experiment regulations are rigidly observed.
4.「HP」
We received 467 questionnaires and analyze whether our project is suitable for national communities.
We went to Navy General Hospital and interviewed Director. Hao to asked her opinion of our project
Golden Medal
1.「HP」
We established Synthetic Biology club in SHSBNU school.
We went to Navy General Hospital and communicated with Hao, the director of stool detection to discuss the current situation about non-invasive measurement in China and her suggestion about our project.
We handed out questionnaires to public and asked for which factor they care most about our project.
2.「Parts」
We divided an existed BioBrick BBa_K895007 into two parts— BBa_K2507002 and BBa_K2507003
3.「Demonstrate」
After doing the survey, we have developed various methods to solve the current problem and meet the public’s concern. We mainly focused on three aspects: safety, sensitivity, and price and response time.
Curry are used to simulate human’s stool to test whether our project is possible to be observe.
4.「Model」
In the modeling, we’ve verified that the florescence–concentration of ths/ttr can be fitted in Hill Equation. Also, we have counted Hill coefficient and concentration of thiosulfate at half-maximum response. Additionally, we’ve made the contrast between different conditions
