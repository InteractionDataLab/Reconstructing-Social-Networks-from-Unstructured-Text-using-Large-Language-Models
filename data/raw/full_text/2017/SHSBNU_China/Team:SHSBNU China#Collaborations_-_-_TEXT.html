Collaboration
Offering help to RDFZ_China
https://2017.igem.org/Team:RDFZ-China/Collaboration
From 1st Oct to 27th Oct, we assisted RDFZ_China to chemically transformed pht01 into Bacillus subtilisaccording to the protocol which was offered by Tsinghua Microbesâ€™lab. Moreover, we helped them to debug the constructing of pveg_rbs_sfp_rbs_oepcrproduct. Our advisor, Xuan Wang, gave them a brief introduction about basic rules of biobricks and guided them how to construct a meaningful biobrick.

At the same time, they helped us to hand out questionnaires that we mentioned in Human Practice and we finally got more than 400 samples at all. They also helped us to upload .css file to iGEM wiki.

Probiotics E.coli Nissle 1917 Shared by BNDS_China
https://2017.igem.org/Team:BNDS_China/Collaborations
E. coli Nissle 1917 is a kind of intestinal probiotics which can survive under the circumstance of Gut Inflammation. To applied our biosensor system in the real physiological condition, it is necessary to take intestinal probiotics like E. coli Nissle 1917 as host bacterials and perform functional tests under the condition of Gut inflammation. Here, E. coli Nissle 1917 that we used in functional tests was a kind gift from BNDS_China.
Interlab experiments with Peking team
https://2017.igem.org/Team:Peking/Collaborations
The lack of resources and places to perform experiments always troubled a lot of iGEM teams from high schools. In the middle of July, we performed Interlab experiment in the Department of Life Sciences in Peking university, which offered by Peking iGEM team. Besides, they guided us how to use proper equipment in their lab. Peking also helped us draw the diagram in the abstract part. They also offered us some suggestions on how to draw graphs in a more academic way. It motivated us to recognize limitations in our project and make every effort to overcome them. Additionally, we appreciate Zhang Yihao carried our parts from Beijing to Genscript in Nanjing, or we cannot submit our parts in time.
Discussions about Human Practice part with Tsinghua iGEM team

As an experienced undergraduate team, Tsinghua team mentored us to design the questionnaire about Gut Inflammation and how to use online survey app.
