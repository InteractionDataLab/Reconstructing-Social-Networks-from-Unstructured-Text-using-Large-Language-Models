Human Practice
For the human practice part, we have four main events. First of all, we did a presentation to introduce iGEM competition and set up an iGEM club in our school. Secondly, we did some questionaries for our project in order to understand some basic opinions around people and whether they would prefer the product we designed. Besides, our team members went to Navy General Hospital to complete an interview with a doctor. It's mainly about the suggetion from those experts and the superiority for our project compare to the current way of detecting the gut inflammation. Last but not the least, one of our team captain also wrote a mini novel about synthetic biology and published on Zhihu (the biggest knowledge network in China).
