After the experimental simulation to confirm that colorful bacteria (expressing chromoproteins) are able to work even in the condition of “excrement” (actually curry),  we replaced the sensors’ reporter by gfasPurple, asPink, amilCP, respectively. While thiosulfate sensor works with chromoproteins as expected, the tetrathionate sensor does’t response very well. Accordingly we changed its reporter to a dark-green molecular-protoviolaceinic acid, which successfully solved the problem. At last, we experimentally demonstrated that <I>E. coli</I> cells carrying our engineered sensor-reporting systems are quite promising to detect gut inflammation in real medical scenarios.</P><P style="font-family:arial;color:#000000;font-size:20px; text-align: left"> Verifying the function of ThsS/R &amp; TtrS/R </P><P><STRONG>ThsS/R</STRONG></P><P>ThsS (BBa_K2507000) and ThsR (BBa_K2507001), both codon-optimized for <I>E. coli,</I> are two basic parts which belong to the two-component system from the marine bacterium <I>Shewanella halifaxensis.</I> ThsS is the membrane-bound sensor kinase (SK) which can sense thiosulfate outside the cell, and ThsR is the DNA-binding response regulator(RR). PphsA(BBa_K2507018) is a ThsR-activated promoter which is turned on when ThsR is phosphorylated by ThsS after ThsS senses thiosulfate.</P><P>Because thiosulfate is an indicator of intestinal inflammation (Levitt et al, 1999; Jackson et al, 2012; Vitvitsky et al, 2015), the ThsS/R system can be used as a sensor for intestinal inflammation. Our experiments confirmed that the system indeed works as a thiosulfate sensor, both in <I>Escherichia coli</I> Top10 and <I>E. coli</I> Nissle 1917. By linking <I>thsR</I> with <I>sfgfp</I> (BBa_K2507008), chromoprotein genes (BBa_K2507009, BBa_K2507010, BBa_K2507011) or the violacein producing operon vioABDE (BBa_K2507012), this system can respond to thiosulfate by producing a naked-eye-visible signal (GFP, spisPink-pink chromoprotein, gfasPurple-purple chromoprotein, amilCP-blue chromoprotein, or the dark-green pigment protoviolaceinic acid).</P><P>Figure 1.

We submitted all of the parts to the iGEM registry in pSB1C3.</P><P>Characterization experiments were performed aerobically. Bacteria were cultured overnight in a 96-deep-well-plate, with 1ml LB media + antibiotics + different concentrations of inducer (thiosulfate) in each well. <STRONG>The conclusion is that while the system (ThsS/R) works, despite the leaky expression is rather heavy.</STRONG></P><P>Figure 2.

To our surprise, we found that the plasmid backbone (pSB4K5) we used for <I>thsR</I> expression has several mutations in the pSC101 replication origin, which means that pSB4K5 is actually a high-copy plasmid!

We measured sfGFP intensity using flow cytometry. (<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:SHSBNU_China/Protocol">https://2017.igem.org/Team:SHSBNU_China/Protocol</A>).

TtrS is the membrane-bound sensor kinase (SK) which can sense tetrathionate outside the cell, and TtrR is the DNA-binding response regulator (RR). PttrB185-269 (BBa_K2507019) is a minimal TtrR-activated promoter which is activated when TtrR is phosphorylated by TtrS after TtrS senses tetrathionate.</P><P>Winter et al. have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the host during inflammation convert thiosulfate into tetrathionate, which this pathogen consumes to establish a beachhead for infection (Winter et al, 2010). Thus, tetrathionate may correlate with pro-inflammatory conditions and can therefore be used as a sensor for gut inflammation.</P><P><STRONG>Characterization</STRONG></P><P>We first validated that this system can function as a tetrathionate sensor and reporter in the laboratory strains <I>Escherichia coli</I> Top10 and <I>E. coli</I> Nissle 1917.</P><P>Figure 6.
