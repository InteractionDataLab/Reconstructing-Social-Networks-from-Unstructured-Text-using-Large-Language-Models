Applied Capsule ingredient statement
(The structure of polyacrylic)
At the inside of capsule, it contains polyacrylic resin to control the dissolving process of the capsule. Polyacrylic is made from Methacrylic acid, Methyl propiolate and acrylic ester in different proportion. Nowadays, polyacrylic resin II and III are the common material used in coating. The effective portion of polyacrylic resin is its carboxyl. When polyacrylic resin in low PH environment, the carboxyl will combine with hydroxyl ion and form salt, so that it is easier for bacteria to pass through.
Storage information
The probiotic medicinal product contains viable bacteria in a high concentration. For this reason, it should be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature ranging between +2° C and +8° C. An interruption of chilling for a few days will have normally no influence on the number of viable cells. Therefore it is much available for patients to get effective products.
Safety
In case of a prolonged heat exposure, however, the bacterial cells will to some extent lose their viability. No toxic substances will be developed.
Sensitivity
Because the capsule ingredient has been designed consummately, we can make sure the bacteria will not be released in wrong position, so these bacteria will work intensively. Specific speaking, our engineered bacteria show distinct color-depth difference when exposed to different concentrations of tetrasulfate and thiosulfate, ranging from 0.01 mM to 1mM. The probiotics are able to produce (Flow-process is following), and there will be an obvious result when the chromoprotein mix with excrement for we have down an experiment about color modulation (the result is following)
