Zhang Chen is the team leader and was mainly responsible for modeling and wiki building. He also participated in a part of the experimental work and human practice.
Chen Xiaoxiao is the art designer and she engaged in designing our team logo and building the wiki. Besides this, she worked on the biosafety part with the help of Huanding Ji and also gave a hand in the laboratory work.
Ji Huanding,Li Boxuan, Guo Weihuang, and Zhou Haoyu mainly focused on the operation of our project.Li Boxuan collaborated with Ji Weihuang to select suitable chromoproteins for the reporter system. Ji Huanding took part in building the biosensor with the help of Li Boxuan. As for functional tests of two sensor systems,Zhou Haoyu and Ji Huanding managed to make improvements of the sensitivity.
Ji Huanding collaborated with Chen Xiaoxiao to design the biosafety part.
In human practice,Ji Weihuang and Li Boxuan went to the “Navy General Hospital” to conduct the survey about Gut inflammation and obtained some kind suggestions from Dr. Hao.Zhou Haoyu analyzed the questionnaires and wrote a summary about detection methods of Gut inflammation. Also, Chen Xiaoxiao wrote a science fiction story to help popularize synthetic biology.

Team training & Project start
Does your institution teach an iGEM or synthetic biology course? On our school official website, all of accelerated biology courses are uploaded on this website. These courses can be finished during holiday so that we could learn more about IGEM and synthetic biology at school. Every week, we would spend about two hours on synthetic biology courses. Wang Xuan taught us synthetic biology and lead us to look through projects of previous teams
When did you start this course? We started learning synthetic biology in April 2017.
When did you start brainstorming? In June 2017, after we finished the synthetic course.
When did you start in the lab? In July 2017, We spent all of our holiday in the lab
