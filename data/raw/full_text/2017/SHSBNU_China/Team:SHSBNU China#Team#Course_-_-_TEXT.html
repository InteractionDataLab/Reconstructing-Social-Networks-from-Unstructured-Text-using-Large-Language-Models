Introduction to Biology Courses in SHSBNU
There are different levels of Biology courses in the SHSBNU international division. Those students who have the best potential and enthusiasm for Biology (about 20% of all students) usually choose to learn Accelerated Biology during the summer vacation before grade 11, Honors Biology in the 1st semester of grade 11, and Genetic Engineering Experiments in the 2nd semester of grade 11. In some special cases, students (about 5%) even choose to learn these courses in grade 10.
The Accelerated Biology Course or Standard Lv. Biology Course, normally takes 60 hours to finish. The students learn: molecules of life, cell structure and metabolism, cell cycle and genetics, basic molecular biology, basic concepts of evolution, regulatory systems in human physiology, and basic concepts in ecology.
The Honored Biology Course aims for SAT2 and AP Biology tests, and takes another 60 hours to finish. The students learn: phylogeny and systematics of life, invertebrate structure and evolution, structure and evolution of chordates, plant structure and evolution, detailed physiology in animal tissues and 10 human systems, as well as supplementary knowledge in ecology, biomolecules, biochemistry and animal ethology.
The Genetic Engineering Experiments course takes 20 hours of teaching and practice with the students: basic concepts of genetic modification, techniques of bacterial culture, plasmid extraction, enzyme digestion and ligation of DNA, electrophoresis to examine DNA molecules, plasmid construction and transformation, and induced gene expression of GFP.
By learning through all these courses, the students are well-armed and prepared to engage the challenges of Biology contests like iGEM, and even real-world biological research.
