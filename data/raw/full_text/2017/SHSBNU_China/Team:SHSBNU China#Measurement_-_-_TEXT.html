Measurement
First, we used logarithmic phase (log phase) bacteria to measure their fluorescence by using flow cytometry. Log phase bacteria are in the best phase of growing so that its data outcome would be the most accurate and valuable. After transforming the bacteria into LB medium and incubate overnight (for 8-12 hours) at 37Â°C, the medium is diluted 196-fold and incubated for 3 hours; then the bacteria is diluted 700-fold with fresh M9+Glycerol medium or sodium thiosulfate to reach log phase, then we use flow cytometry to measure the fluorescent intensity.
Second, in order to examine the effect of mixing the outcome color of our bacteria with human excrement, we used curry to simulate the excrement, with different color depth simulating different kinds of excrements. This is much more safe and friendly because we no longer need to get in touch with excrement.
Under anaerobic condition, GFP is difficult to be maturated. So We measure sfGFP fluorescent after 1h maturation.
