Improvement
Before our marine Shewanella baltica TtrS/R ( BBa_K2507013 , BBa_K2507014 , BBa_K2507015 , BBa_K2507016 , BBa_K2507017 ) system, the only known genetically encoded tetrathionate sensor is the Salmonella typhimurium TtrSR two-component system (TCS) (Hensel et al, 1999; Price-Carter et al, 2001). However, they found S.typhimurium’s promoter PttrB is repressed by oxygen and nitrate via the global regulator Nitrate Reductase Regulator (FNR). While the oxygen levels in the intestinal are poorly understood by human beings Kristina et al think the oxygen level maybe relatively high near the epithelial mucosal boundary because of near to the blood. Meanwhile, nitrate levels in intestinal have been shown to be improved during inflammation (Winter et al, 2013). In iGEM 2012, Dundee used Salmonella TtrS/R system BBa_K895007 and the system works well.
The sensor we use S.baltica TtrS/R which is only weakly repressed by oxygen and not repressed by nitrate in E. coli. And our S.baltica TtrS/R system can work well using protoviolaceinic acid as the reporter BBa_K2507017 , which display dark-green color. And our system could also work poorly using sfGFP as the reporter.
