Colony PCR was performed with a primer that amplifies ITS 1 region.
We sequenced the PCR products and identified yeasts of Funazushi.
From the result of the sequence, the yeast of Funazushi was identified as S. cerevisiae.
Therefore we decided to use S. cerevisiae BY 4742 which is commonly used in experiment as yeast to add nutrition in Funazushi.

Accoding thesis, it is known that the salt concentration of Funazushi is 4% and pH is 3.7.[1]So we experimented whether S. cerevisiae BY 4742 could grow like S. cerevisiae of Funazushi under this severe environment.

We analyzed the odor components of 3 types of Funa-zushi. We weighed 42.9 g of sample A, 48.6 g of sample B, 51.3 g of sample C (fish meat, only egg), shredded them, put each sample in a 1 liter round bottom flask, and put pure 30 ml into it .　Each sample was steam distilled for 60 minutes, and 100 ml of these distillates were obtained. These distillates were extracted with ether three times to obtain 150 ml of ether extract. The ether extract was transferred to a 300 ml Erlenmeyer flask, placed in a 36 ° C. water bath, and concentrated at normal pressure until the volume reached 15 ml. This solution was transferred to a test tube with memory and concentrated to 1 ml with argon gas. From this, 5 μl was taken out with a syringe and analyzed with GC-MS (GC-2010 SHIMADZU, GC-MS-QP2010 Plus). Compounds detected as major peaks were collated with a database and the detected peaks of the standards of the compounds were compared with the detected peaks of the samples to determine that the compounds estimated therefrom were contained in the sample. The results (Table 1) suggest that Sample A contains propionic acid and oleic acid. It cannot be concluded that the other peaks are the compounds shown in Table 1. Sample B is considered to contain 4-allyl-1,2-dimethoxybenzene and oleic acid or palmitic acid. It cannot be concluded that the other peaks are the compounds shown in Table 1. Sample C is considered to contain 4-allyl-1,2-dimethoxybenzene. It ca not be concluded that the other peaks are the compounds shown in Table 1. It is thought that it is necessary to review the sample adjustment to obtain more accurate results.
