iGEM Japan Kansai Forum
iGEM Japan Kansai Forum was held by Team Kyoto in Kyoto Uiniversity. Some Japanese iGEM team gathered it and We made some presentations for our projects, manegement our team.After the presentations, we had some questions and answers periods. We could understand more deeply because we could  discuss our project with  participants. Seniors who rely on the participants participated a lot, and a sharp point, adequate advice fluttered. We also were pointed out questions, advice and shortcomings. With these questions we could review the project and made it better. Also, I heard stories about the administration of other universities, and they also thought about doing cloud funding. At the end of the forum, all the participants wrote feedback on the questionnaire and pointed out the specific improvement points of each other's team.This effort helped one after the forum.

Gifu
Meeting with team Gifu that their project is fermented food was held by team Nagahama. As each theme is Japanese traditional food theme, we brought mutual research theme of Funazushi and sake and talked about regulation of genetically modified food in Japan. We discussed how our projects can actually work.We thought of it. And since each organism used is S. cerevisiae, we advised on experiments using S. cerevisiae. We talked about the characteristics of the promoters we used and we discussed what is best.
Gifu taught me that the expression level of S. cerevisiae mRNA can be regulated not only by promoter but also by terminator. All devices used our project have CYC1 terminetor.We decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons. If we wanted to express more mRNA, we found that it would be better to turn into high activity of terminator. This was useful information for our project. We advised team Gifu about the selection marker of S. cerevisiae. Since Gifu seemed to be suffering from S. cerevisiae selection marker to be used, we suggested that we used genetic markers.
Furthermore, we discussed the matter regarding the safety and law concerning experiments and GMO. We taught mutually regulations on the handling of genetically recombined organisms. Gifu presentated about bio-safety.

Botchan_Lab_Tokyo
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo was founded last year and It is an iGEM team of Tokyo University of Science, a private university in Japan that participated in this year's first iGEM. Team Nagahama is one of the few private university teams in Japanese iGEM team. We helped each other. At iGEM Japan Kansai Forum , we were the only private university iGEM team, so we advised on how to set up funds at the time of group establishment, acquisition of funds, operation method etc. as the team of the same private university. We also taught how to write a wiki.In addition, We responded to the questionnaire that Botchan_Lab_Tokyo performed. This questionnaire was necessary as an appeal for Botchan_Lab_Tokyo to be allowed to participate in iGEM. There was a question such as whether I think it is a good experience to participate in iGEM .
Botchan_Lab_Tokyo has earned funds through Crowd Funding before us and has been collecting support beyond the target amount and making it succeed. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8JKakFLY7TYsYukTtGmsDGoeiY1lvAFV5h1YIyR2ipn-MiA/viewform
We got advice on how to support Bobchan Lab, for cloudfunding. In addition, there are many sites that can do cloud funding, it is important which site to use. We were at a loss what site we are going to do with cloud funding. Botchan_Lab_Tokyo taught us the feeling of use of the site "campfire" they used. This was useful information for us. And in fact Nagahama also used campfire. This advice is one factor in the success of our cloud funding. Botchan_Lab_Tokyo Collaborations
Kobe
Team kobe was founded last year and is a team of Kobe University who participated in this year's iGEM for the first time. Team Kobe has helped each other since we met iGEM Japan Kansai Forum. In order to hear the opinions of many people against their projects, we participated in a super-dissimilar field meeting. Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference was a conference where people from various fields such as biology, engineering, economics, etc. gathered. So I thought that it might be able to receive advice from various directions. We invited team Kobe to join us. So we contacted the organizers and made it possible for team kobe to participate. At Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference, we watched each other's poster sessions and gave some advices.
Even crowdfunding helped each other. By diffusing information on cloud funding by SNS and disseminating it to each other, many people got to know the activities.And the financing became smoother. Team kobe has earned funds with Crowd Funding before us, and has been collecting support above the target amount and making it succeed. When we started cloud funding, we referred to the team Kobe's cloud funding. We felt that this has led to support. Kobe Collaborations

The May Festival
UT-Tokyo hosted an event for Japanese iGEM teams during the school festival of the University of Tokyo, “May Festival”. We  presented  poster  to other iGEM teams ( Kobe , Gifu , KAIT, Kyoto , Tokyo_Tech, Botchan_Lab_Tokyo , UT-Tokyo) and also listened to their presentation. We had a great time sharing project ideas.
