Futurework
We will try to create S. cerevisiae which make necessary nutrients for nation which is troubled by starvation while have resistance to high salt concentration and low pH.
Adapteing S. cerevisiae to low pH
First of all, we wanted to complete DNA fragment overexpressesing HAA1 because we could not complete. Once this DNA fragment is completed and integrated into the genome by homologous recombination, S. cerevisiae will adapt severe environments. So it is possible to freely design fermented foods.
strengthening resistance against severe environment and increasing production of nutrition
We are also considering strengthening resistance against severe environment and increasing production of nutrition. Gifu taught me that the expression level of S. cerevisiae mRNA can be regulated not only by promoter but also by terminator. [1]All devices used our project  have CYC1 terminetor.If we wanted to express more mRNA, we found that it would be better to turn into high activity of terminator. Since the activity of cyc1 terminator is 0.556105, it can be thought that increasing production of β-carotene and strengthening of salt tolerance can be achieved by changing to higher activity terminator than cyc1 terminator. We decided to use CYC1 terminator with no reasons. Since using a highly active terminator may cause problems, we would like to carefully examine whether they are really the best choice for us.
