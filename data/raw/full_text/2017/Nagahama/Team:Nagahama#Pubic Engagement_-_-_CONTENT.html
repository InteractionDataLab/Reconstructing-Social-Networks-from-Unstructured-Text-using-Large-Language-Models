We presented poster in the 6th Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference.
Many people said it was interesting.
We discussed our project with people in various fields.
Many people said it was interesting.
We got opinions from many people.
We were able to pass the primary examination of the best award of poster presentation.
I was able to spend a very productive time.

</P><P>We took part in School festival at the Universtiy of Tokyo. We did a poster session about synthetic biology. Other japanese iGEM team took part in  it.We were stimulated their projects.And we could disscuss projects.the general public joined in May festival.We spread our project and our activities to general public.

This project analysis data of the microorganisms involved in the information and food related to traditional fermented food of Japan, food functionality and nutrition of data, such as by matching the statistical data, scientifically elucidate the food culture of Japan around , Trying to find new value in food.
We are researching traditional fermented food of Shiga prefecture called Sushi Sushi, so I was asked to investigate it.
We investigated the shops that make Fnazushi for over 100 years and have the history and method of making.
From the method of making Funazushi, We got a hint of our research.
We were surprised  to see that the techniques that have been handed down since ancestors still remain the same as in the past, being performed politely.
Through this article We think that it would be good if many people have the opportunity to know the depth of the sushi history and the goodness as a fermented food.

</P><P>We raised funds to many people through the Internet in a way called cloud funding to acquire research expenses.
Since we need funds for activities such as experiment cost and participation fee to the world convention, we worked for 2 months to raise funds.
This activity not only gained funds but also many opportunities to explain our projects, iGEM and synthetic biology to many people in general.
Finally 22 people supported 215,000 yen.
This is a proof that our project was found worthy to support.
</P><P>We were able to receive support from various local companies and the general public, and we were able to spread our ideas.

</P><P>At the research meeting &quot;Evolutionary research of microbiome in the age of big data&quot;, We announced the project as iGEM Nagahama for this year.We could learn the technique to analyze the microflora. It was called metagenome analysis and I heard stories that were very helpful.
Many microorganisms are involved in the fermentation of Funazushi, but the mechanism of fermentation is not known in detail, so we are currently analyzing the microflora to clarify it.
We got various opinions on the project.

Many companies and stakeholders from educational institutions were involved.
We announced our activities as representatives of Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology's voluntary activity group.
We talked about experience gained at iGEM, support of university, this year's project.
