Pubic Engagement/Dialogue
The 6th Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference.
March 2,3,15 and 16
We presented poster in the 6th Hyper-Interdisciplinary Conference. Many people said it was interesting. We discussed our project with people in various fields. Many people said it was interesting. We got opinions from many people. We were able to pass the primary examination of the best award of poster presentation. I was able to spend a very productive time. https://hic.lne.st/english/
The May Festival
May 20 and 21
We took part in School festival at the Universtiy of Tokyo. We did a poster session about synthetic biology. Other japanese iGEM team took part in  it.We were stimulated their projects.And we could disscuss projects.the general public joined in May festival.We spread our project and our activities to general public. https://gogatsusai.jp/90/visitor/about_en.html
The Shiga Tech Grand Prix
The Shiga Tech Grand Prix was a project 's Grand Prix to help solving social problems by utilizing technologies based on science and technology, to talk with people with the same intention.In July we took part in the Shiga Tech Grand Prix to find the projects collaborators.We made presentations of our projects and disseminated our ideas. https://techplanter.com/shiga2017/
Helping with collaborative research lecture of value creation of food by Tokyo Institute of Technology and GURUNAVI Inc.
We cooperated with the Japanese company GURUNAVI Ink. for research on fermented foods of Tokyo Institute of Technology. This project analysis data of the microorganisms involved in the information and food related to traditional fermented food of Japan, food functionality and nutrition of data, such as by matching the statistical data, scientifically elucidate the food culture of Japan around , Trying to find new value in food. We are researching traditional fermented food of Shiga prefecture called Sushi Sushi, so I was asked to investigate it. We investigated the shops that make Fnazushi for over 100 years and have the history and method of making. From the method of making Funazushi, We got a hint of our research. We were surprised  to see that the techniques that have been handed down since ancestors still remain the same as in the past, being performed politely. Through this article We think that it would be good if many people have the opportunity to know the depth of the sushi history and the goodness as a fermented food. http://comp.bio.titech.ac.jp/gnavi/
Crowd funding
May 19〜July16
We raised funds to many people through the Internet in a way called cloud funding to acquire research expenses. Since we need funds for activities such as experiment cost and participation fee to the world convention, we worked for 2 months to raise funds. This activity not only gained funds but also many opportunities to explain our projects, iGEM and synthetic biology to many people in general. Finally 22 people supported 215,000 yen. This is a proof that our project was found worthy to support.
We were able to receive support from various local companies and the general public, and we were able to spread our ideas. https://camp-fire.jp/backers/23410#menu
Research meeting" evolution study of micro-biomes in the age of big data"
February 28 and 29
At the research meeting "Evolutionary research of microbiome in the age of big data", We announced the project as iGEM Nagahama for this year.We could learn the technique to analyze the microflora. It was called metagenome analysis and I heard stories that were very helpful. Many microorganisms are involved in the fermentation of Funazushi, but the mechanism of fermentation is not known in detail, so we are currently analyzing the microflora to clarify it. We got various opinions on the project.
Symposium about "fostering science and human resources in high school
March 31
We participated in a Symposium about "fostering science and human resources in high school sponsored by Nagahama Bio University. Many companies and stakeholders from educational institutions were involved. We announced our activities as representatives of Nagahama Institute of Bio-Science and Technology's voluntary activity group. We talked about experience gained at iGEM, support of university, this year's project. We were able to spread iGEM and synthetic biology to many people. Video is here.
Appearing on television "Good morning Kansai"
June 28
It was broadcasted in the Kansai area. In TV program,We took up the fact that this year's project for Giant Jamboree and the challenge of fundraising in cloud funding are challenged.We got a lot of offer to support from those who saw this program. http://www4.nhk.or.jp/P2849/
Appearing on television “Oumihatsu630”
October 11
It was broadcasted in the Shiga Prefecture. We had a chance to appearance on TV and to spread our project and synthetic biology. We discussed our project, synthetic biology, safety of genetically modified foods with the cast. It was very valuable time for us to have a discussion with them.
Kinseijyokamachi furusato Festival
June 3
While Serving drinks, we used  poster to disseminate iGEM and to introduce our project. We got a support from a proponent who wants to support research funds. http://kitabiwako.jp/syusse/furusato.html
PTA
June4
We talked about synthetic biology and our project in  PTA .
Introducing synthetic biology to high-school teachers
June 17
We explained synthetic biology and our project to high-school teachers of Nagahama
Freshers’ Camp
April 5
Freshers’ Camp is an event for the freshmen. It helps them to get used to college life. We talked about activities of iGEM Nagahama and synthetic biology
Introducing iGEM in pre-admission lectures
We explained the activities of iGEM Nagahama and synthetic biology to students before enrollment.
