Among them, starvation is the one. Our team made nutritious foods that can be stored for a long time to help people suffering from hunger.Starvation is caused by the fact that not only calories but also nutrients such as protein are short. Therefore, we proposed nutritious food that can be stored for a long time by fermentation mainly using fish which is a protein source which does not cost money to raise.We focused on the fermented food called Funazushi which rooted in the area where we live in. We thought that we develop nutritious food by recombining Saccharomyces cerevisiae which was dominant species of Funazushi and making S. cerevisiae produces nutrients lacking in the area.We chose Vitamin A as nutrient added this time.Vitamin A deficiency is one of 3 major micronutrient deficiencies.
Vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin, accumulates in the body when it ingests excessively, causing side effects.So we decided to make S. cerevisiae synthesizing β-carotene which is a precursor of vitamin A converting to vitamin A in the body as necessary.In addition, Funazushi is fermented at high salt concentration and low pH. In order to add more nutritional value to Funazushi, we needed to develop new recombinant S. cerevisiae that not only makes more nutrition but also adapts severe environment.Our S. cerevisiae was designed to grow and stand at high salt concentration and low pH.

 Here, we show our strategy following three sequential steps towards accomplishing our goal.
(1)Overexpression of endogenous HAA1 gene of S.cerevisiae adapted to low pH.Overexpression of endogenous HAA1 gene of S.cerevisiae adapted to low pH. HAA1 is transcriptional activator involved in adaptation to weak acid stress and activates ranscription of TPO2, YRO2, and other genes encoding membrane stress proteins. 
(2)Insertion of sod2 gene (Na + / H + antiporter) derived from Schizosaccharomyces pombe into the plasmid and it's introduction, enable to grow at high salt concentration.
(3)Carotenoid biosynthesis genes (crtE, crtYB and crtI derived from X.dendrorhous) are inserted on the genome of S. cerevisiae.
(4)In order to increase production of beta-carotene, HMG1 gene which catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate as rate-limiting step in sterol biosynthesis is also inserted on the genome of S. cerevisiae by homologous recombination.
By using of this microorganism we can make more valuable nutrient Funazushi with high amount of beta-carotene than ever through fermentation.
The results we obtained are as follows:
(1)We could not complete DNA fragment overexpressesing HAA1. 

(2)S. cerevisiae engineered with sod2 parts <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K2256000#Confirmation_that_S._cerevisiae_expressing_sod2_acquired_salt_tolerance">(BBa_K2256000)</A> standing salt tolerance was confirmaed.We were able to validate our constructed genes working well.

(3)β-caroten was produced probably by S. cerevisiae engineered with β-carotene synthesize device. We insertion of crtYB, crtI and crtE resulted in orange colonies.

(4)β-caroten production probably was increase by S. cerevisiae engineered with device for increasing β-carotene production.Transformation of tHMG1 to S. cerevisiae synthesizing carotenoid resulted in yellow colonies. 
We were able to characterize that color of colony  was changed yellow from orange when tHMG1 <A rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K849000">(BBa_K849000)</A>was inserted into S. cerevisiae synthesizing carotenoid.
