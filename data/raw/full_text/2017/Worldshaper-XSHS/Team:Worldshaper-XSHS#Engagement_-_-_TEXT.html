Education and Public Engagement
In order to make the project beneficial to the education and public engagement, we have designed a lot of relevant content in human practice(for more informaion about human practice: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/HP/Silver ).
About Education
1.Based on the results of interviews and social surveys, we have learned about the lack of public knowledge about water pollution and synthetic biology. So we created our own Wechat account WorldshaperXSHS and runned public information on it. Over summer break, we totally published 39 posts.These posts contains team introduction, program introduction, synthetic biology, gene engineering, water quality monitoring and so on, which has been welcomed by many people.
2. We made three propaganda films about synthetic biology played in our high school. It let more students know about synthetic biology.
3. We carried out social propagandas to introduce us and our project to the public. Our first  presentation was held on July 15, 2017 in Xiasha, Hangzhou. Then on July 30, 2017 we took a part in a propaganda activity in Hangzhou Science and Technology Museum.
4. We also publish our stories in websites and newspapers. So people can learn more about synthetic biology and iGEM through our stories.
About Public Engagement
1. Before we started the project design, we conducted interviews and social surveys. In our project design, product design, and WeChat content selection, we fully consider public's suggestions and requirements.
2. To get more students in the school to study synthetic biology, learn about iGEM, we are going to set up a “iGEM” club in our school. Until now, we have communicated with the school leaders and obtained the support from the school.
