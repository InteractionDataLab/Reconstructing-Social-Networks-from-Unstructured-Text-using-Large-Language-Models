Demonstrate in experiment
In our project, we constructed a number of parts (for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/parts.html ).Some of these parts are related to the detection of oxygen concentration in oxygen(BBa_K561001, BBa_K2512008).We tested the parts in DH5Î±, confirming that these parts can actually detect the concentration of oxygen in oxygen(for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/result.html ).
Demonstrate in product
According to the results of the investigation and interview, we designed the product. Due to the limited time and ability, we only made the model of version1: The carry-on size biologic reactor with colorimetric indicator (for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/Applied_Design ).
we designed a carry-on size detector. It is a box with 9 holes, which can be placed to measure the oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus samples (Figure 1, Figure 2).
We printed out the model using 3D printing(figure3). On the basis of 3D printing, we beautifed the model, and removed the temperature control device and the core line from the discarded yogurt, and transformed our model. Here are some photos of the model(figure4,figure5).
