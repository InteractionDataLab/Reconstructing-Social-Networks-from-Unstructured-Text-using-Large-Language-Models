STANDARDS
1.Safety standards
Usually pose a minimal potential threat to laboratory workers and the environment
Do not cause any diseases in healthy people
Do not pollute the environment
Not harmful to the experiment itself
2.Safe lab
Labs are not usually isolated from the general buildings or the traffic, which don’t do harm to surrounding.
Do use biological safety cabinet and laminar flow cabinets
3.Training for safety
Training on the specific procedures to handle the biomaterials
Supervised by a trained microbiologist or scientist
Learn some safe instructions before every time do an experiment.
As high school students, we did not have access to this level of biological experiments or biological laboratories before participating in the igem competition, so we had more systematic and professional laboratory teaching and training before conducting the research, and these courses were taught by professional teacher. After several training and pre-experimental safety guidance, the players are more skilled to master the laboratory of various types of instruments of experimental methods and safety precautions. After that, we carry out research on the subject, so there is a better activity guarantee in the safety of the whole research.
4.To Implemented Standard Microbiology Practices
Safe handling-Use antibacterial soap
Use a disinfectant to clean the exposed surface
Only specific persons are allowed to enter and leave during the experiment
SUMMARY
As we know，safety comes the first. For the safety concern, we ensure security through the following three aspects.
1. Self-protection: We strictly adhere to the biological laboratory operating standards. For example, when using EtBr for gel electrophoresis, we bring gloves on and never touch the area tainted with EB. After that, we wear laboratory glasses to check the result. Our lab is also equipped with Eye-washing and fire extinguishing equipment to deal with the accident.
2.Environment-protection:During the experiment，we classify waste liquid into certain types and then recycle it, avoiding leakage. We insist on the operation of the clean bench, and after the end of the experiment with hand sanitizer to avoid the bacteria being carried out. We use the host bacteria which are heterotrophic organisms, to ensure that even if a small part of the leak will not survive.
