Model
According to the functional analysis results, we knew that the fluorescence expression of oxy1 and oxy4 were different.Compared with oxy1, through T7RNA polymerase and T7  promoter, oxy4 will amplify the signal(figure 1).But just how much the signal is amplified, and what is the relationship between it and the dissolved oxygen concentraion, we still don't know. So we explored the model of the correlation between fluorescence expression and oxygen concentration. In modeling, we need to use a lot of knowledge of advanced mathematics. As a senior high school student, we can't use it very well, so we only have a very simple model.But we've really worked very hard. The results are as follows.
figure1. The working mechanism of Oxy4
Oxy1
Oxy1-sealed, 475 nm exciting light
We studied the relationship between Oxy1 bacterial fluorescence expressi0n and oxygen concentration under the condition of sealing, and did the function fitting.
To make the data comparable,we standardized the fluorescence intensity and OD600 of each group.?Firstly, we subtracted the initial fluorescence intensity and the initial OD600 from the fluorescence intensity and the OD600. Then we divided the fluorescence intensity by the OD600.We had the function fitting for the obtained values, and we got the following functions and images(figure2):
Equation:    r 2 =0.87,
figure2. the relationship between Oxy1 bacterial fluorescence expressi0n and oxygen concentration
When we averaged the values of each group, we got better fitting functions and images(figure3).
Equation:    r 2 =0.87,

Oxy1-sealed, 395 nm exciting light
For the fluorescence intensity of the excitation light of 395nm, we processed the data in the same way. Here are the functions and images(figure4):
Equation:   r 2 =0.99,

Oxy4
We also studied the relationship between Oxy4 bacterial fluorescence expressi0n and oxygen concentration under different conditions, and did the function fitting. Data processing was the same as before.

Oxy4-unsealed, 475 nm exciting light
Equation:   r 2 =0.94,

The result of integration
We integrated the expressi0n models of the two strains.It can be seen that, c ompared with the Oxy1 strain, the fluorescence intensity of the Oxy4 strain was stronger in low oxygen condition, which suggested that the Oxy4 is more suitable for oxygen detection.
