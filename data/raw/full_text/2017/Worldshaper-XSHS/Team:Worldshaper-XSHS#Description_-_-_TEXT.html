Brief Description(Version 1.0)
Backgroup
Hangzhou, the city with a long history in China, is famed for its water, especially the West Lake. The Grand Canal and moats, with other rivers and lakes ran throughout the whole city and build up an advanced water transportation network, which as well gives rise to prosperous aquafarms and other industry connected to water. Account for the lack of administration in the past, the water pollution became a serious problem. As people are paying more attention to the water environment protection recent years, the Hangzhou Municipal People’s Government released the action agenda of “A Treatment for Five Waters”, which proposed that the waters should be divided into regions which would be supervised and analyzed by specially assigned people. Without enough necessary analyzing instruments, however, the results can only be based on the color and odor of the water, leading to considerable errors.
Objective
In order to solve this problem, we are using synthetic biological methods, constructing an certain E. coli strain that can easily detect the concentration of soluble oxygen, phosphorus or nitrogen in water, which are three important indicators to measure the quality of water. We anticipate that it would provide an easy and low-cost method of analyzing water quality in the rivers. Meanwhile, we would like to extend the use of this method to the field of aquaculture in the near future.
