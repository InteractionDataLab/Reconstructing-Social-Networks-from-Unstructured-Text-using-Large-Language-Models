Collaborations
To become an outstanding team, cooperation is essential, especially with other teams and social groups. On one hand, we work on improving our own experiments in collaboration. On the other hand, we promote IGEM along with the knowledge about synthetic biology. We did a lot of collaborations with other teams:
1. At the beginning of the experiment, the iGEM team Worldshaper-Wuhan found that the skeleton plasmids in distribution kit were not available. We put plasmids on the filter sheet and sent express packages to them with the necessary plasmids(figure1 to figure3).
2. In the work of Interlab, we also collaborated with other teams. We learned that the iGEM teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing had problems with plasmids transformation, so we provided these two teams with Interlab related plasmids (positive control, negative control and device1~device6, a total of 8 plasmids)(figure4,figure5). Since we didn't have a plate reader, we borrowed it from iGEM teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing. During the experiment, our three teams worked together to solve the technical problems during the experiments(figure6,figure7).
3. In the design and improvement of the experiment, we also have a lot of collaboration with other teams. From July 26 to July 30, 2017, the iGEM team Worldshaper-Wuhan came to visit. Our four teams, ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing and Worldshaper-Wuhan, and us discussed the experimental plan together(figure8). We introduced the experiment to other teams, and we exchanged a lot of ideas(figure9). We also held propaganda activities with other teams(for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/HP/Silver ). The largest one was in Hangzhou Science and Technology Museum on 30 July(figure 10).The cooperation provided guidance and assistance for the reconstruction of their research subjects. All teams gained valuable experience in the construction of plasmids.
4. In October, the iGEM team from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences invited us to collaborate their programs. Igem UCAS sends their protocol to us via email (download protocol) .They sent us the relevant reagents by express delivery （ figure11 ） , and they also sent us presents(figure12). We and other three teams ASTWS-China, Worldshaper-Nanjing Worldshaper-Wuhan did the experiment together at our Xiasha lab(figure13).
