Product Design
According to the results of the investigation and interview, we designed the product. Because the students' imagination is so rich, we designed many versions of the design.Here are two of the designs that we think are the most feasible.
Product design Version 1.0:
The carry-on size biologic reactor with colorimetric indicator.
For better using this biologic detect technic in daily life, we designed a carry-on size detector (shown in Figure 1 to Figure 5) It is a box with 9 holes (Figure 6), which can be placed to measure the oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus samples. We use UV emitters to stimulate protein expression (BFP, GFP, RFP). For each test material to design a standard colorimetric card and compared with the standard colorimetric card to know the size detected content of samples. And there is a camera head inside the lid, to take pictures of the wells and send to a microchip. A screen on the front side will show the results after analyzing the pictures with the microchip. This whole device is powered by batteries and will be light and compact. At the same time, we will also design a timer on the front surface of the product to display the countdown time.
Additionally, we found that the structure of the homemade yogurt machine and the product is similar to that. So we hope to make our products by transforming the yogurt machine.
Instrument instructions:
1. the corresponding freeze-dried powder of Escherichia coli was added into each well and activated with 500 micro amount of culture medium.
2. samples were taken for 3ml, and they were slowly added into each sample well, and positive and negative samples were prepared in positive control and negative control wells.
3. press the "start" key, the detector starts heating to set temperature, prompting the reaction.
4. wait for 4h, use the standard color card to read the readout number under the ultraviolet light irradiation.

Product design Version 2.0:
A portable bioreactor based on imaging technology
Due to the different concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus can make corresponding fluorescent protein expression in Escherichia coli of different intensity, therefore we assume that the first acquisition luminescence image of different concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus, and built-in mobile phone. Then the now popular clamping type mobile phone lens into a special reactor (Figure 7), the standard image directly using a mobile phone to get the image and built-in comparison, determine the concentration of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus in samples. But this idea also involves lens transformation, image software development and so on, so now is just an idea, we hope that in the future research into this idea into reality.

Physical model
Due to the limited time and ability, we only made the model of version1. Maybe this model isn't perfect, but we've done our best.
We printed out the model using 3D printing(figure8). Until this summer, we had only heard of 3D printing, which we thought was amazing, but we hadn't used it yet. To print this model, we learned how to use the design software and learned how to use the printer. It's really not easy. In this process, we should sincerely thank the teachers and students of the automation college of zhejiang university of technology. We couldn't have finished the work without their help.

On the basis of 3D printing, we beautifed the model, and removed the temperature control device and the core line from the discarded yogurt, and transformed our model. Here are some photos of the model(figure9-figure13).We will also take this model to Giant Jamboree to share with you!
