Though the Interlab Measurement Study is an optional and voluntary exercise for all team, our team members are very enthusiastic and wish to join the Study. Because we know that “Measurement is fundamental to everything we do”!
During the study, we encountered many difficulties. The first difficulty was that there was no plate reader in our lab. We asked a lot of LABS and finally borrowed from Hangzhou Precision Medicine Research Center. The second difficulty was that we didn't know how to do with some steps. Fortunately, our lab is in Zijingang campus of Zhejiang University. It is very convenient to consult the IGEM team of zhejiang university. We have learned a lot from senior.At the same time, we also asked in iGEM's QQ group, where there was also a lot of information.Through various efforts and the guidance of professor zhu, we finally completed the experiment!
From August 19 to August 21, 2017, we conducted our first experiment in Hangzhou Precision Medicine Research Center. But we were not very happy with the results. Therefore, after consulting the senior for some experimental details, we conducted the second experiment on August 28 to August 30.
We have submitted both results to the iGEM organizing committee, and we hope that our results can be reviewed.The affirmation from the iGEM organizing committee will be a great support and encouragement for us!
