Integrated and Gold
We have thought carefully and creatively about whether our work is safe, responsible and good for the world. We have done a lot of human practice before the project and in the process of the project(for more information: https://2017.igem.org/Team:Worldshaper-XSHS/HP/Silver ). Human practice is very helpful for our project design, project adjustment, and final product design.
 
For Project Design
From the interview and social surveys, we know that:
1. people think the “water pollution is relatively serious”
2. “if they have a handy detector, they really want to go to measure it”.
3. Most people believe that using biological methods to detect water system is efficient.
As a result:
1.We decided to do a project related to water quality testing.
2.We hope to eventually design a simple water quality test reagent or instrument
 
For Product Design
From the interview and social surveys, we know that:
1.People are very willing to test the water quality themselves, if they can.
2. People want the detector to be easy to operate and not very high on accuracy.
3. People hope the detector will not be too expensive.
As a result:
1.we decided to develop a bioreactor for testing the water quality.
2. We hope this detector is portable.
3. In order to reduce the price of the detector, we hope to obtain some components from the old yogurt machine.
 
For Engagement
From the interview and social surveys, we know that:
1.People are lack of knowledge about water pollution and synthetic biology.
2.School are also lack of knowledge about water pollution and synthetic biology.
As a result:
1.We announced our iGEM achievements on the school WeChat public account, introducing our team and related activities and letting the public understand our work.
2. Our teammates made three videos about the biology knowledges that we used in our program. Then we showed the video to the students.
