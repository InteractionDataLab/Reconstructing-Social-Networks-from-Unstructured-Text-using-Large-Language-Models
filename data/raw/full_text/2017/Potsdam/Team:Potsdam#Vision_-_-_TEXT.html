Our vision
After finishing our two main projects, we envision several ways to continue what we have started.
For our first project “metabolic channeling using dCas9” we could:
1. Optimize
Optimization is of course an important next step and stands at the center of our overall project. Metabolic channeling is supposed to increase the effectiveness of enzymes and an even greater performance by optimization is a natural next step. This could be achieved by trying different spacer lengths to find the optimal distance between channeled enzymes. Also, an easy, fast and cheap way to assemble the low and high copy machinery for metabolic channeling is desirable.
2. Varying the pathways
An increased Auxin output is a good and easy way to show a proof of concept but that’s not what our project is aimed at. Trying different enzyme pathways with different numbers of enzymes will also help optimize the overall process. Also, the final goal is to improve overall output of enzymatic products in real world fields like medicine, food industry and production.
3. Streamlining
The end goal of metabolic channeling via dCas9 would be applications in industry. For that we would need to streamline the process of adding desired enzymes and corresponding target sequences to the low and high copy plasmids. A creation kit with pre-assembled scaffolds and only the specific enzymes to be added would greatly improve the distribution process in research institutions and industry.
Our second project “metabolic channeling using LLPS in yeast” could be continued in:
1. E.coli
We used yeast to demonstrate LLPS because of the size of the droplets to be formed. Although the formation was successful we got a first-hand experience why yeast is not easy to work with. The short growth time and easy handling of E. coli is encouraging a future effort to generate LLPs in E. coli.
2. Human cells
LLPs has already been observed in HeLa cells by attaching YFP to the droplet forming proteins. Therefor LLPs does not need to be proven in human cells anymore. By combining our idea of using LLPS for metabolic channeling and the already proving environment of human cells the advantage would be an increased production of pharmaceutics and other products only synthesizable in human cells.
