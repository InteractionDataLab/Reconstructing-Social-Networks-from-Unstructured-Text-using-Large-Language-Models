Lab book
We separated our lab book into the following parts:
Monday, 08/21/17
- prepared 500 ml of synthetic dropout (SD) medium:
- 3,35 g nitrogen base + 0,39 g dropout mix diluted in 450 ml water
- adjusted pH to 5,75 with 1 M NaOH
- adjusted volume to 475 ml with water
- filled in a 1l-bottle with 10 g agar
- autoclave
- prepared a 40% glucose solution (500 ml)
-> autoclave separately and add 25 ml to SD medium before use!
- streaked yeast strain YPH500 on YPDA plates (on clean bench)
incubation for 2,5 days at 30°C
Tuesday, 08/22/17
- transformation of 1 ng pYES-CT2 into competent E. coli cells
plated 200 µl of the transformation on amp plate
incubation over night at 37°C
Wednesday, 08/23/17
- transformation hasn't worked
trafo was done again: new aliquot of pYES2/CT (128 ng/ul)
- two transformations into competent JM109: 1 ul of aliquot, 1 ul of 1:10 dilution
- plated 50 µl of each transformation mix on amp plates, centrifuged the remaining transformation mix, resuspended in residual medium and plated on additional amp plates
- Amplification of IDT- fragments (see low-copy lab book)
- Eppi: "D", 65°C annealling Temp.
- Primer: Q35/36
- tomorrow test gel run
- inoculation of YPH500 (one clone from the plate from monday (21.08.17)) in 10 ml YPD-Plus-Medium (from zymo research) for production of competent cells
- incubation over night at 30°C and shaking at 200 rpm
Thursday, 08/24/17
- culture did not grow (not enough cells, use inoculation needle!)
- new culture made for competent cells
- culture for miniprep of pYES vector for tomorrow (no colonies on yesterday's plate)

- incubate for 2h at 37° shaking
- heat inactivation at 80° for 20 min (no shaking)
- PCR clean up according to Promega kit (stored in our -20° freezer, concentration 51,8 ng/µl)
- inoculated preculture for competent cells (yeast, in right 30° shaker)
Tuesday, 08/29/17
-OD of yeast culture from yesterday: 1,15
-> dilution: 2 ml of culture and 8 ml YPDA medium
-culture stopped growing (probably because of change of medium, always use YPDA medium for cultures. Our medium is only for transformations -> expensive)
-inoculated new culture (15 ml YPDA medium) -> in 30° shaker
Wednesday, 08/30/17
-still working on competent cells: OD600 this morning not measurable
-diluted twice: first 2 ml yeast-culture + 8 ml medium -> OD still too high; again diluted 1/5 (2 ml yeast-culture + 8 ml medium) -> final dilution factor 1/25
-harvested culture at OD=1,18
-because of OD measurements only 9 ml cultur left -> added 1 ml medium (so we could use the 10 ml tara)
-for procedure see protocol of ZymoResearch on folder
-We use the kit in the fridge.
-use a 10 ml Tara for centrifuging
-cells stored in -80° freezer in a box labelled with LLPS, tubes labelled with CY (Competent Yeast)
Thursday, 08/31/17
-produced plates (Dropout-Uracil, added 25 ml of 40% Glucose)
-transformation of  pYES and Ddx4YFP in competent yeast cells:
-50 µl competent cells, 100 ng pYES (digested), 100 ng Ddx4YFP

-plated 150 µl and 50 µl
Monday, 09/04/17
-did transformation of pYES and Ddx4-YFP again because last time not done under steril conditions (no yeast clones on plates, only contamination last time):
added 5,1 µl of Ddx4-YFP (tube "YFP 6", c = 19,6 ng/µl)
added 1,96 µl of digested pYES (c = 51 ng/µl)
added 500 µl EZ3 solution

-loaded colony PCR products from friday on a 1% agarose gel (100 V, 45 min)
clone nr. 1-8 (nr. 4 accidentally picked two times)
'-'= negative control (only water)
clone nr. 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 showing correct band (~ 1900 bp)
-picked clone nr. 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 again from master plate and plated on new SD-Ura plates + inoculation of the same clones in 3 ml SD-Ura liquid medium (incubation 30°C, + liquid culture shaking with 200 rpm)
-also picked a YPH500 clone (plate from 21.08.17) and plated on new SD-Ura plate -> will not grow! (should have used YPDA medium!) + inoculation of the clone in 3 ml SD-Ura liquid medium -> will also not grow
Tuesday, 09/12/17
-liquid culture from yesterday did not grow -> discarded
-same clones on the new SD-Ura plates also did not grow -> spreaded them a little more with the loop
-not enough growth til afternoon -> have to grow over night
-make new liquid culture tomorrow (better: 5 ml liquid cultere in 100 ml flask) for microscopy on thursday
-clone 8 didnt grow at all -> discarded
-made YPDA medium (1x500 ml for plates (with agar) and 1x500 ml for liquid culture (without agar; in cold room):
10 g Difco peptone
5 g yeast extract
(10 g agar) -> only for plates
15 mg adenine hydrochloride
(we didnt adjust the pH -> Fabian said we dont have to)
-> add 25 ml 40% glucose before use!
-made YPDA plates -> cold room
-plated YPH500 from old plate (21.08.17) on new YPDA plate -> incubation at 30°C
-made SD-Ura medium (liquid) -> cold room
Wednesday, 09/13/17
-YPH500-Ddx4-YFP clones (2, 3, 5 and 7) on SD-Ura plates -> sufficiently grown
-made 6 ml liquid culture (SD-Ura medium + 25 ml 40% glucose) for tomorrow
-transferred quite a lot of cell material from plate to liquid medium (with the loop) -> significant clouding of liquid
-used baffled flasks for better growth
-additionall inoculation of YPH500 (wild type) as control for microscopy
-made 6 ml liquid culture (YPDA medium + 25 ml 40% glucose)
-transferred quite a lot cell material from plate (21.08.17) to liquid medium (with the loop) -> significant clouding of liquid
-used baffled flasks for better growth
-For tomorrow: please take the new plate of YPH500 out of the incubator -> use parafilm to protect the plate from drying out
Thursday, 09/14/17
-WT from 13.9. totally overgrown -> next time more medium/less cell material
-Results of fluorescence microscopy:
fluorescence visible
"noisy" background fluorescence in WT yeast
Addition of NaCl intensified background fluorescence in WT (we have no explanation for that yet)
-->Neither change in temperature nor in osmolarity induced the formation of droplets
-> Not possible though  in this experiment, because the plasmid contains a Galactose inducible promoter and no Galactose was added
On the contrary: The medium used contained Glucose, which represses the translation of the Ddx4-YFP construct
-Started preparing SD medium (800 ml H2O+ 6,7 g Yeast Nitrogen Bas + Aminoacid mix) -> sent for autoclaving

-determined the OD(600) of the preculture (20.09.)
-calculated amount of preculture necessary to obtain an OD(600) of 0,4 in 10ml of induction media:

Friday, 09/22/17
-flourescence microscopy in house 20:
-only less fluorescence visible in all samples (wt, clones with Ddx4-YFP in galactose or glucose SD-Ura medium)
-it seemed like all clones didnt grow well in the medium with galactose -> less cells and most of them still in cell division phase
-fluorescence microscopy at the mpi: used leica confocal microscope (software for the pictures: LAS AF)

-> positive clones: 2 and 7
-droplets were visible without induction with cold shock or osmotic shock!
-->(because of high Ddx4-YFP concentrations in yeast)
-->incubation on ice (cold shock) for ~ 1 min -> had no effect on droplets
incubation on a ~ 37°C block (heat shock) for ~ 1 min:
-->droplets partially disappeared -> more smaller droplets, less intense when cooling down again
-->fluorescence spread over entire cell
Monday, 09/25/17
-YPH500-Ddx4-YFP clone 2 and 7 (plate of September 11th) newly streaked on SD-Ura plate (two on one plate)

troubleshooting:
-concentration of IDT fragments shpuld be 50ng/µl but is not (see gel picture, there is nothing to see from the IDT fragments)
-->5µl of the IDT fragments were load to a 0,7% agarose gel, shpuld be 250ng, but was around 25ng -> 10x smaller than it should be
-fragments must be cleaned up from the gel
11,5µl fragments with loading dye were load to 1% agarose gel -> 30min 120V
bands were cut out -> tomorrow gel clean up
-transformation of pYES2-CT-IAAM_d_NaeI (12.10.17) 30,4ng/µl -> 3,3µl and IAAH-cassette (12.10.17) 37,3ng/µ -> 2,7µl in competent yeast-cells; 100ng each
