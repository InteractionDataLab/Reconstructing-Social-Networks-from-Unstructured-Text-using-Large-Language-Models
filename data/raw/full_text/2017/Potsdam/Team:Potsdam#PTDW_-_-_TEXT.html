Potsdam Day of Science
At our booth, we showed which products include or will be produced by genetically modified organisms. Many people do not know what genetic modification is or that every organism and every cell contains DNA. We tried to bring the synthetic biology closer to women, men and children.
We also isolated the DNA from bananas together with children. They were so excited to see the whole genetic information, since every cell includes it. DNA is everywhere but you cant "touch" it, thereby it was even more interesting for the small explorers.
Did you see this?
