KLAS
KLAS (Knowledge Link through Art and Science) is an interdisciplinary Artist in Residence program focused on creating a connection between synthetic biology and art. It was founded at the Max-Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces in Potsdam-Golm near our campus.
The project aims at informing the public about advancements and ethics questions in synthetic biology whilst combining these topics with arts installations in regular workshops and panels. We got in contact with Dr. Rodrigo Perez-Garcia, member of the organisational team for KLAS and also talked with one of the artists residing at the MPI at that time (he’s from Brazil and plans on storing music via DNA in E.coli!).
There will be a workshop at the 27th and 28th of November, where we will be holding a short talk about our view about synthetic biology and how we experienced working in science for the first time and how that differs from the general public’s view on how science works.
