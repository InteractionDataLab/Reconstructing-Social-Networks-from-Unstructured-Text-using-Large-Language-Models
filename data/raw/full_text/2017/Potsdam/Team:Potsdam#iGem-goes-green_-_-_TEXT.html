igem goes green
“The future will either be green or not at all.” - Bob Brown
This year's Team Dresden had the idea to make iGEM a greener competition. In the first place this means to make participating teams aware of  the environmental implications of their projects and how to work more environmentally friendly.
Therefor the Team Dresden created a GoGreenGuide , an emission calculator, lab poster and much more. Moreover, they hosted a workshop during the German Wide Meetup . During the German Wide Meetup we participated in this workshop, afterwards we decided to take part in iGEM Goes Green. So, we read the guide and took some advice for a greener lab - below you can see the points we fulfilled -  and we also used the calculator ( have a look ). In addition, the Team Dresden suggested to think about ideas to compensate greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of planting a tree, we gave away Bryophyllum plants at our university.
