International cooperation and engagement with other teams are important parts of the iGEM competition. Being in contact with more experienced iGEM teams helps overcoming difficult steps during the project but even exchanging thoughts with new iGEM teams always yields progressive solutions and creative ideas.
</P><DIV class="spoiler"><DIV class="inner" style="display:none;"><P align="justify"><B><FONT size="5"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU-Eindhoven"> Team Eindhoven </A></FONT></B>
Team Eindhoven can be seen as our main collaborator as for them being the team we had the most contact with. We were informed by our iGEM contact that they worked on a project similar to our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Http://2017.igem.org/2017.igem.org/Team:Potsdam/Abstract"> LLPS </A> approach to metabolic channeling. Their project called GUPPI (link) uses the concept of membrane less organelles to form a gel like structure which could be used in various applications. This was exciting news for us since they concentrated way more on the detailed properties of the droplet forming proteins. 

They agreed to a first skype call during which we had a very informative and interesting exchange about our projects. Our teams agreed to a mutual collaboration by helping each other out with problems and talking about overall experiences we had during the projects. The main talking points were Human practices approaches and ideas how to efficiently explain their project to the public. They helped our wiki team getting started by providing HTML and CSS literature. We also set them up with a contact person regarding the modelling of their project.

At the end of summer, we kept in contact and had further skype calls and the collaboration continued by them helping us in a crucial part of the iGEM medal competition with simulating and modelling our LLPs system. This gave us a better and more detailed understanding of the inner workings of our project. General communication continued in the form of regular skype conferences. Furthermore, our wiki teams kept in contact and provided feedback for each other’s wikis. We also agreed to help each other during the Grand jamboree by listening to each other’s project presentations before the main Grand Jamboree talk.

In order to collaborate with other teams we scheduled some video conferences via Skype. 
This gave us the chance to directly exchange information with e.g. the iGEM team Peshawar. The discussed topics were amongst others talking about the progress in the lab, comparing notes inside and outside the lab and looking for possible collaborations. 
Skype made it possible to get in touch with people from other far away countries with other talents than us and help each other in solving problems that accrued during our working journey and motivating each other. </DIV><DIV align="center"><B>Talking with you was very informative and great fun.

This year's  <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden">Team Dresden</A> had the idea to make iGEM a greener competition. In the first place this means to make participating teams aware of  the environmental implications of their projects and how to work more environmentally friendly.

Therefor the Team Dresden created a <A href="https://github.com/igem-dresden/GoGreenGuide/releases/tag/v1.0">GoGreenGuide</A>, an emission calculator, lab poster and much more. Moreover, they hosted a workshop during the <A href="https://2017.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team%3APotsdam%2Fmeetup">German Wide Meetup </A>. During the German Wide Meetup we participated in this workshop, afterwards we decided to take part. So, we read the guide and took some advice for a greener lab - below you can see the points we fulfilled -  and we also used the calculator.
In addition, the Team Dresden suggested to think about ideas to compensate greenhouse gas emissions. We had the idea to give away <I>Bryophyllum</I>.<A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:TU_Dresden/iGEM-goes-green/Green_Teams"> Other <FONT color="#669900">green </FONT> Teams - Team Dresden </A></P><B>Our steps to a <FONT color="#669900">greener </FONT>lab</B><B>Freezer</B>✓ Become a sample minimalist. ✓ Share with a neighboring lab. ✓ Clean the freezers regularly. <B> Electrical devices </B>✓ Remember to turn them off every time you finish your task! <B> Lab consumables </B>✓ Dry orders: We order our oligos dry. ✓<A href=" https://www.instagram.com/igem_goes_green">Follow iGEM goes green </A>✓ Get creative! → We are reusing old paper boxes in the freezer. ✓ Label your stuff! ✓ Pipette tips: We refill our empty tip boxes by purchasing our tips in bulk. ✓ Tubes: We get the tubes in bags and refill our racks. ✓ Waste manager: We have an expert for the wast, who knows where everything belongs. <B> Workspace </B>

In other words: The German Wide Meetup. This years German Wide Meetup took place in Dresden from June 30th to July 2nd. Nine teams followed the invitation by the iGEM Team Dresden. 

The weekend started with some getting-to-know games in the “Großer Garten”. During this time, first exchanges about projects and experiences happened between the teams. 

On Saturday, the Meetup continued with student talks, in which every team gave a short presentation about their projects. On top of that, even Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher and Marcel Thiel from Promega, gave  little input talks. The day finished of with a Sight-seeing tour through Dresden and a Tortilla-Party afterwards. 

A last get-together occurred on Sunday morning. Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun gave a talk about BIOMOD, a biomolecular design competition. Further down the line two workshops took place: <A href="https://2017.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team%3APotsdam%2FiGem-goes-green">“iGEM goes green”</A> and speed-dates “Collaboration”. After a last group photo, the teams departed.    

The event was a great opportunity to get to know the other German teams, to exchange ideas, experiences and to talk about collaborations. Thanks to the iGEM Team Dresden for organising and hosting this amazing event. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="spoiler"><DIV class="inner" style="display:none;"><FONT size="5"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf"> Team Cologne-Duesseldorf </A></FONT><DIV style="text-align:center"><DIV style="text-align:center"><H1>Who is not excited to receive a postcard? </H1></DIV><DIV align="left"><P align="center">
It is a way to share holiday experiences, memories, events and to make Synthetic Biology more popular. 
So we were excited to join the postcard campaign by Cologne-Düsseldorf, creating our own postcard and receiving amazing postcards in return from iGEM Teams around the world. Moreover, we distributed these postcards in town, schools, busses, trains, to neighbours and friends. 

What a great idea from <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Cologne-Duesseldorf"> Cologne-Duesseldorf! </A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="spoiler"><DIV class="inner" style="display:none;"><P align="justify"><B><FONT size="5"><A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:Berlin_diagnostX"> Team Berlin diagnostX</A></FONT></B>
Working with the iGEM Team Berlin was uncomplicated due to the fact they are our direct neighbors. They made contact with us in June in order to exchange information about our projects and the competition in general. It is their first iGEM year, too, this way we had many problems in common.  

We met in Berlin for playing Volleyball and they invited our team to take part in a workshop with the Boston Consulting group, that we gladly accepted.
In return we helped them to get an aliquot of the vector pSB1C3, with which they have had troubles.
