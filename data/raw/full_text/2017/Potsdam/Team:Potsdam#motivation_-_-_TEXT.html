Our motivation
Research work forms the basis of social progress by combining many fascinating aspects of science. We see iGEM as an important preparation for students of sciences and future researchers regarding their careers. Being able to acquire real work experiences early, learning to be independent as well as working in a team is a great  opportunity. A few of us have already been working in their field of interest so they were able to share experiences with the team. Nevertheless, everyone had a chance to grow their potentials in a different working environment.    iGEM offers the possibility to work in a team to reach one's scientific goals, create your own projects and become comfortable working with other people. Even if you did not have a university degree yet it does not exclude your personal potential. We are grateful that IGEM exists, for it is a great way to help students in their scientific career and develop the field of synthetic biology.
