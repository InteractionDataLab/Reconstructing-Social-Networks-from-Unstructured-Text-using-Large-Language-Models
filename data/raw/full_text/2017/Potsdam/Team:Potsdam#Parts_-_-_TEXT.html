Parts
Due to time constraints, we were only able to send in the parts:
BBa_K2483000 (IAA-RBP fusions),
BBa_K2483005 (Target cassette with 6 bp spacer),
BBa_K2483006 (Target cassette with 18 bp spacer) and
BBa_K2483007 (Ddx4-YFP).
The rest of the parts:
BBa_K2483002 (LacI-dCas9),
BBa_K2483004 (final low-copy construct),
BBa_K2483008 (Ddx4-IAAs),
BBa_K2483009 (yeast optimized IAAM and IAAH)
is planned but not sent to the reigstry with 007-009 belonging to the LLPS project and 000-006 to dCas9. Please remember that we forgot to check for illegal restriction sites in the parts 008 and 009 which resulted in a SpeI site in both of them.
