Skype Conversations
In order to collaborate with other teams we scheduled some video conferences via Skype.
This gave us the chance to directly exchange information with iGEM Peshawar, for example . The discussed topics were amongst others talking about the progress in the lab, comparing notes inside and outside the lab and looking for possible collaborations.
Skype made it possible to get in touch with people from other far away countries with other talents than us and help each other in solving problems that accrued during our working journey and motivating each other.
Talking with you was very informative and great fun. Hopefully we stay in contact after iGEM! See you at the Giant Jamboree in Boston!
