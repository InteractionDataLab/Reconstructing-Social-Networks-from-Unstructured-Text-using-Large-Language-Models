pSB4A5 (sample1 and 2 combined) 10.6ng/ul
IAAH-PP7 (sample 3 and 4 combined) 17ng/ul
IAAM-MS2 (sample 5 and 6 combined) 12.2ng/ul
Check concentration with testgell
--> load 25 ng
-->concentration of samples seems to be correct
1)Gibson Assembly of IAAH-PP7 and IAAM-MS2 to form IAA-Fusion:
IAAH-PP7 (--> 50 ng) 2.94 µL
IAAM-MS2 (--> 61.11 ng) 5 µL
Gibson Mastermix 10 µL
H2O 2.06 µL
--> incubation for 40 min at 50 °C
2)PCRs using Gibson Assembly Product "IAA-Fusion)
Mastermix
20 µL 5x GXL buffer
8 µL dNTPs
2 µL Primer 1
2 µL Primer 2
2 µL GXL DNA Polymerase
32 µL H2O
3x 24 µL + 1 µL template (IAA-Fusion 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000)
2a) Primer: IG_C_Q42,  IG_C_Q43
--> Overhang for Gibson Assembly with pSB4A5
2b)Primer: IG_C_Q43, IG_C_Q45
--> Overhang for restrichtion and ligation in digested pSB4A5
PCR program:
Denaturation 98 °C 10 s
Annealing 60 °C 15 s
Elongation 68 °C 4 min
3)digested pSB4A5 from 9.10
Dephosphorylation of the digested pSB4A5:
27.5 µL pSB4A5_d_E+P
6 µL 10x Cutsmart buffer
3 µL Quick CIP
3 µL H2O
-calculated the volumes of the other components with a wrong volume of the digested pSB4A5, I thought it would be 48 µL
Incubation for 10 min at 37 °C
Heatinactivation for 2 min at 80 °C
c(dephosphorylated)=(27.5 µL*33.44 ng/µL)/39,5 µL=23.28 ng/µL
4)Salkowski Assay
-AMP+Trp LB-agar plate was inoculated with positive P4 clones from 9.10
-Additionally 2 negativ controls were used:
negative clone 24
clone 12 of TAC1_4FraA
-Incubation until 18.00 at 37 °C
--> over night at room temperature
-Test gel of IAAM-MS2, pSB4A5 and IAAH-PP7
-Result: stated concentrations seem to be correct!
