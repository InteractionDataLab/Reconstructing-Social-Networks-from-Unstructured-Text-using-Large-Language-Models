BBa_K2483000 - IAA producing enzymes fused to RNA-binding proteins under control of Pveg2
The idea of the contribution requirement of iGEM is to expand the uses and information available of different parts in the registry.
This part is an upgrade to the part BBa_K515100 of iGEM Imperial College 2012 producing Indoleacetic acid with the enzymes IaaM (Indoleacetic Acid tryptophan monooxygenase) and IaaH (Indoleacetamide Hydrolase). Here we fused the IAA enzymes to the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) MS2 and PP7, respectively. We focused on giving this part a new function by being able to bind specific RNA domains.
We used this part to produce Indoleacetic Acid (IAA) in E.coli and increase the efficiency of the reaction by putting them in close proximity to each other (metabolic channelling). This was done with a dCas9 (BBa_K2483002) scaffold where the RNA-binding proteins bind to aptamer sequences added to the 3'-end of a sgRNA and the sgRNA binds to target cassettes where several of the sgRNA recognition sequences are consecutively arranged (BBa_K2483005 and BBa_K2483006). For the complete part with sgRNA, dCas9 and the IAA-enzymes, see BBa_K2483004.
Also see our registry page about BBa_K2483000.
