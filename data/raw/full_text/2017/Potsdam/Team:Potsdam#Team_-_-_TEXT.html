  Greetings from Potsdam!  
Who we are:
We are 12 student team members supervised by Prof. Dr. Bernd Müller-Röber (AG Molecular Biology, University of Potsdam) and Prof. Dr. Salim Seyfried (AG Zoophysiology, University of Potsdam), together with the five instructors Dr. Joachim Forner, Dr. Paulina Fuentes, Lena Hochrein, Dr. Roland Knorr, Dr. Joachim Kopka and Dr. Fabian Machens.
Also we could count on the active assistance and knowledge from Max (who directed and edited our crowfunding video), Niek (who got not tired to explain us everything we wanted to now about designing websites and helped us a lot to create this Wiki) and Sina (who brought our enzymes to life with her drawing skills)- thanks a lot.
Do you want to get more information of each team member? Want to know, what we would like to have invented? Just folllow the link: We introduce ourselves and check us out! :)
