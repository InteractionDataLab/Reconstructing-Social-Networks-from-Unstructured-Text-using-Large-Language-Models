MAX PLANCK RESEARCH NETWORK IN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
"The Max Planck Society and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research dedicate the new research project MaxSynBio to Synthetic Biology. Research groups from nine Max Planck Institutes across Germany, as well as the Department of Theology of the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, are involved."

The MaxSynBio Network supports us with lab equipment and computer programs. With a large credit account we were able to realize our project.
Many thanks to you.
Our University supports us with an exceptional amount of funding. Without this money we wouldn't participate in iGEM - we couldn’t have paid the registration fees.
Many thanks to you.

Many thanks to you.
Potsdam Transfer supported us with the attendance fees for the Giant Jamboree and with printing our poster. Without you, our Team would not make it to Boston.
Many thanks to you.
POTSDAM TRANSFER
“The goal of the transfer service is to transfer the extensive know-how and the results from research and development into innovative technologies for the economy. We help to overcome the hurdles on this path: starting with the identification and analysis of research results for market applications and project initiation and takeover of project management, through the registration and marketing of protective rights through the patent and licensing service to the presentation at international trade fairs our messaging service.“

Many thanks to you.
