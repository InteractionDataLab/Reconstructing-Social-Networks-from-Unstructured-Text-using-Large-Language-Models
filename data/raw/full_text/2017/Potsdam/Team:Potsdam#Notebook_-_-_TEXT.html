Lab book
We separated our lab book into the following parts:
Wednesday, 07/12/17
*Preparation of Media:
Tryptone
35g
Yeast extract
17,5g
NaCl
17,5g
dd water
3,5L
*1.5 L were aliquoted: 2x 500 mL, 5x 100 mL
* 2 L were used for LB-Agar:
Tryptone
16g
Yeast extract
10g
NaCl
5g
dd water
1L
-->aliquoted 2x500 mL (will be used for the preparation of competent cells)
Plating of JM109 ("Preplate" for "Preculture" which is needed for the preparation of competent cells)
Organization of boxes for Plasmids, Primer, Stocks, etc.  --> the boxes are organized according our 3 main tasks: LLPS, high copy, low copy + antibiotics
Thursday, 07/13/17
-tried SLiCE buffer, failed miserably
-finished Triton buffer, inoculated culture for competent cells
-prepared DTT (1M at -20C), forgor to do aliquots
-finished competent cell buffer
Friday, 07/14/17
-aliquoted DTT stock in 5x0,9ml
-sterile filtrated CaCl2 solution
-sterile filtrated  CaCl2 + Glycerol
-made competent cells following protocol
- made 23 LBagar plates with CAP
-made 31 agar plates with AMP and 23 with KAN
Tuesday, 07/18/17
-started competent cell test by transferring test kit DNA (BBa_J04450) into our competent cells using Competent Test Kit protocol inoculated SOC medium (from Fabian) with JM109 -prepared 10x SLiCE buffer (19 50 µl aliquots in the -20° freezer)
Wednesday, 07/19/17
-Start with the JM109 culture for preparation of the SLiCE extract (bacteria had to grow until they reach an OD600nm of 3.0 -->reached at ca. 12:00i)
-Preparation of 80 % glycerol solution (sterile filtered)
-Preparation of 100 mM CaCl2 solution (autoclaved)
-Plan for the next days
-Further preparation of the SLiCE extract
Thursday, 07/20/17
-inoculated JM109 preculture for competent cells tomorrow with 20 mL LB
-prepared eppis for competent cells tomorrow
-competent cell test following competent cell test protocol
-filled 1mL tip boxes, glass beads for plating, sent for autoclaving
Friday, 07/21/17
-made competent cells
-tested competente cells on AMP plates
              a) pUC19 10pg/ul = 0,01 ng/ul
              testet competente cells with 1 ul from a)

T1M Tris-HCl
121,14g
1M Boric acid
61,82g
0,02M EDTH
7,44g
-restock with ddwater to 1L
-pH: 8,5
Tuesday, 08/15/17
*made new 10xTBE buffer (1L)
*same as above but used Tris Base
Thursday, 08/17/17
-prepared plates  with Kan, Cap resistance
-added the antibiotica right before pouring the plates under clean bench for 500 ml LB -Agar +  ad 500 uL antibiotica
-> stored in the freezer room under the table Cap plates  and on the table Kan plates
Thursday, 09/07/17
-prepared medium for plates
Friday, 09/08/17
-prepared 50ml 0,02 M NaOH

(used: 500ml 1xTBE, 3,5g Agarose, 5µl EtBr)
Wednesday, 10/04/17
-ampicillin-LB-plates
Tuesday, 10/17/17
-media for LLPS (YPDA+Ura+Tryp (2*750ml)
