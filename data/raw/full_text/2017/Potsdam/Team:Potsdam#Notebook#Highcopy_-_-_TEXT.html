transformed ligated target cassettes the same way as at the 10.08.17, because there where no colonies in the plates, we used the competent E.coli-cells from Fabian for this transformation, only difference from the protocoll: we used just 450 µl LB-media after transformation instead of 900 µl
To do for Monday: Prepare 500 ml 1% [w/v] agarose (5 g agarose in 500 ml 1 x TAE buffer)

Digestion and ligation of TAC3 taken from gel extraction (24.8., see low copy lab book) (also: digestion and ligation of PP7 -> discarded because futile)
Transformation of TAC3 into JM109 (Amp - backbone and Kan-Backbone)
for digestion see low copy lab book p.23
for ligation see low copy lab book p.24 (only tubes A3 and K3)
Tuesday, 08/29/17
Digestion of TAC2 taken from gel extraction (28.8., see low copy lab book)
At first not enough backbone (pSB1A3, pSB1K3, pSB1C3) for ligation -> please make sure to not accidentally put empty tubes back into the freezer
digested linearized backbones as done before (see high copy to do list p.3) to get more backbone for ligation also amplified linearized backbones (program: ampli Pauline in Torsten)
Ligation of TAC2 with the three newly digested backbones (low copy lab book p.24)
Transformation of all three ligations into JM109 (see transformation protocol, plated 200 µl)
-> Transformations in the 37° incubator
Colony-PCR of the TAC3-transformations from yesterday (Amp and Kan; see Colony-PCR protocol and note the changes in our folder!)
prepared 20 µl aliquots per clone, touched the six best looking clones with a tooth pick, tipped once on the masterplate and then stirred it in the aliquots
-> We had the problem that the toothpick absorbs the aliquot if left in it for too long
Gel picture looks good for both resistances, we inoculated two precultures per resistance for a miniprep tomorrow
Tuesday, 08/29/17

Colony PCR with IG_C_K TaC1_2Fra and IG_C_K TaC3_2Fra (see protocol, wrong annealing Tm in To do list, use 52°C)
gel picture in lab book - no bands for TaC1 and wrong bands for TaC3 (approx 2200 bp)
next steps: rests of transformation (31.8.) of both replated on newly made plates (in case clone have been overgrown by other stuff because of not enough antibiotic in the Agar)
plated 50 µl and 200 µl
new ligation and transformation with rests of digest (31.8.) (in case transformation did not work)
To do: repeat colony PCR (in case that did not work)

26            control     well 9D  (IGEM distribution kit Plate 4)
run  1% agarose-gel at 120V for 1:15h
gel picture see lab book,
result: negative colony PCR ,no good bands ,were too small
-> better : use original plasmid psB1K3 which was already digested with E+P ,since this plasmid never contained a TaC
-> assumption why colony PCR negative: the previously cut  cut TaC from Kan TaC1 ligates with the plasmid   hence the 3A assembly( Tac #(E+S) +TaC #(P+X) could not ligate in the vector
-> better : ligation at 16°C for 2h or overnight
restarted 3A assembly first cycle:
digestion: mastermix insert a, mastermix insert b see To do list table 16 page 15                   used 4µL mastermix + 4µL plasmid(25 ng/µL)
tubes: for insert a: TaC1 C  E+S;    TaC3 C E+S             for insert b: TaC1 A  P+X;  TaC3 A P+X

Digestion reaction for the inserts (a) and (b) for each target cassette type in cycle 3
mix components by pipetting up and down or "flicking" the tube.
microfuge briefly, Don’t vortex!
incubate for 30 min at 37 °C
heat kill for 20 min at 80 °C
store at -20 °C
5b) ligation of target cassettes and plasmid backbones
The ligation is done by using the T4 ligase. In the end, three different ligation reactions should be prepared, so that each plasmid consists of four target cassettes of its corresponding type. The solutions containing the digested backbones from 5a) are used. The inserts are used an equimolar amount. In a reaction volume of 20 µL, 0.02 pmol of each template are used.

3A Assembly – fourth assembly cycle
In this first assembly cycle two Inserts are combined, so that the product plasmid contains five target cassettes. The inserts (a) are digested using EcoRI and SpeI, the inserts (b) using XbaI and PstI. The digestion an ligation is done following the “3A Assembly”protocol of iGEM.
