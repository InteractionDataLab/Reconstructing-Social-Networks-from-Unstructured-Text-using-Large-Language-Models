March for science
On  April 22nd , people went on the streets to support science and research against the ignorance regarding scientific facts for political purposes worldwide. The iGEM team Potsdam partook, equipped with our handmade posters, on the sister march for science in Berlin. We protested alongside with other scientists and supporters against the distribution of “alternative facts” and the hostility towards science. According to the organizer, 11.000 people demonstrated in Berlin. On the same day, there were also sister demonstrations in other german cities like Bonn, Cologne and Hamburg.
