German Wide Meetup
Ten Teams. Three Days. One City.
In other words: The German Wide Meetup. This year's German-Wide Meetup took place in Dresden from June 30th to July 2nd. Nine teams followed the invitation by the iGEM Team Dresden.
The weekend started with some get-to-know games in the “Großer Garten”. During this time, first exchanges about projects and experiences happened between the teams.
On Saturday, the meetup continued with student talks, in which every team gave a short presentation about their projects. On top of that, even Prof. Dr. Thorsten Mascher and Marcel Thiel from Promega, gave  little input talks. The day finished of with a sightseeing tour through Dresden and a tortilla party afterwards.
A last get-together occurred on Sunday morning. Prof. Dr. Hans-Georg Braun gave a talk about BIOMOD, a biomolecular design competition. Further down the line two workshops took place: “iGEM goes green” and collaboration speed dates. After a last group photo, the teams departed.
The event was a great opportunity to get to know the other German teams, to exchange ideas, experiences and to talk about collaborations. Thanks to the iGEM Team Dresden for organising and hosting this amazing event.
