Laboratory exhibition
On June 22, 2017, the LAB-SUPPLY exposition took place in the ESTREL Convention Center in Berlin, a chance our team could not miss. This regional trade fair for instrumental analytics, laboratory technology, laboratory chemicals, and biotechnology attracted more than 900 visitors (among them our iGEM team).
We got the chance to hear presentations about the newest innovations in the field of lab technology as well as lectures from a few equipment manufacturers.
Furthermore, the visit was an opportunity to directly get in touch with the companies to promote the iGEM competition and our team. For instance, we gained the support of companies like eppendorf, OMNILAB and LABOR PRAXIS. To sum up, the convention gave the visitors the chance to gain information from the trade exhibition by around 100 producers coming from lab- and analytic technique, to listen to lectures about the newest trends concerning the application technique in the laboratory, and also to gather tips for the daily work in the laboratory.
