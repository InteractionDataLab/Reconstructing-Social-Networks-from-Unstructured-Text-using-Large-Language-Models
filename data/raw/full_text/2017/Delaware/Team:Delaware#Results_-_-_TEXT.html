Over the summer our team worked extremely hard on our project putting in an enormous amount of time and effort into ensuring safety for our project, unfortunately the unforeseeable event of the McKinley Lab catching on fire delayed our experiment. More information about the fire can be found on Delaware Online’s website here . We were not allowed to enter our lab space building following the fire thus halting our experiment meaning that our project concluded without any significant results. While the fire was certainly unfortunate no students were injured and in fact it brought our team closer together working to find new lab space for next year’s iGem team here at the University of Delaware.
