Team
Attributions
This year was the first year for an iGem team at the University of Delaware. As a team we faced a number of challenges and we would not have been able to face them if it wasn’t of the help of the following contributors and the committed University of Delaware students that put a huge amount of hours into figuring out protocols, writing grants, and working together in the lab.
What did we accomplish?
As a team we were able to create a plasmid construct for bacteriocins that we had the hope of inserting into bacteria using Gibson assembly but unfortunately due to lab restrictions and the McKinley fire we were unable to complete this task.
