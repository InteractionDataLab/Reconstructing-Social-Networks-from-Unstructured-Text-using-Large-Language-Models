Urban Promise
For our teamâ€™s outreach we have focused on the small local community. For our first outreach experience on October 5th 2017 four members of our team went to Urban Promise in Wilmington Delaware. Urban Promise is an after school program that works with elementary school students. Our team members taught the kids about biology. They taught the kids about lab techniques, they specifically focused on how to plate bacteria. In order to be both informative and fun they set up and completed a painting activity with the kids. They set up cups of paint, that served as the bacteria and gave the kids plates which served as the plates of agar that people use in the lab to plate bacteria. The kids used straws to transfer the paint from the cups to the plates. Then the kids were able to spread the paint around, as if they were plating real bacteria.
