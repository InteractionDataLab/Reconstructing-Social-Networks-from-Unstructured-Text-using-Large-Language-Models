This year was the first year for an iGem team at the University of Delaware. As a team we faced a number of challenges and we would not have been able to face them if it wasn’t of the help of the following contributors and the committed University of Delaware students that put a huge amount of hours into figuring out protocols, writing grants, and working together in the lab.
What did we accomplish?
As a team we were able to create a plasmid construct for bacteriocins that we inserted into E.coli using Gibson assembly. Although we were unable to confirm our results due to an unforeseen fire in McKinley labs we were able to later this fall continue working with testing the strengths of various bacteriocins on Lactobacillin Lawns.
