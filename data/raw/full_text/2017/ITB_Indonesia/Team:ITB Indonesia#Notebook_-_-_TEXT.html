Basic Protocols
Plasmid Isolation Using Alkaline Lysis Method
Inoculate transformed cell into LB medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics
Incubate culture at 37˚C, 200 rpm for overnight
Discard supernatan, and repeat the step until all culture is used
Add 100 µl Alkaline Lysis Solution I (0.05 M glucose; 0.025 M Tris-Cl pH 8.0; 0.01 EDTA pH 8.0) and resuspend  cell pellet completely
Add 200 µl Alkaline Lysis Solution II (0.2 N NaOH; 1% SDS), and invert tube several times. The solution should turn into transparent white, indicating the cell is lysed
Add  150 µl Alkaline Lysis Solution III (3M Pottasium Acetate pH 7.2; 11.5% Glacial Acetate), and invert tube several times. The chromosomal DNA should make white floating thread
Incubate on ice for 3-5 minutes
Centrifuge at full speed for 5 minutes. At this point, plasmid DNA is dissolved in the supernatan while chromosomal DNA turn into white precipitate on the bottom of the tube
Transfer supernatan to a new 1.5 microtube, add 2X volumes of isopropanol/absolute ethanol to precipitate plasmid DNA
Centrifuge at full speed for 5 minutes, and discard supernatan
Add 500 µl 70% ethanol to precipitated DNA
Centrifuge at full speed for 5 minutes, and discard supernatan
Let the precipitated DNA dreid by putting the microtube upside-down on a piece of tissue paper
Resuspend plasmid by adding 50 µl TE buffer/Nuclease Free Water
Polymerase Chain Reaction for Restriction-Free Cloning
Mix the following component in a PCR tube, for step I PCR
Quick-spin  the PCR tube, then place on the thermal cycler
Set the PCR cycle profile as follow and then run as follows
Confirm the amplicon by running the product on 1% agarose gel, 70V for 35 minutes
If positive, continue to purified PCR product using GenepHlow Gel/PCR Purification Kit (Promega)
Mix the following component in a PCR tube for step II PCR
Quick spin the PCR tube, the place on the thermal cycler
Set the PCR cycle profile as follow and the run
Confirm the amplicon by running the PCR product on 1% agarose gel, 70V for 35 minutes
Restriction
Mix the following mixture in a PCR tube
Quick spin the PCR tube, then incubate at 37˚C for 30 minutes-60 minutes
Incubate at 80˚C for 10 minutes to deactivate enzyme
Confirm product by running on 1% agarose gel, 70V for 35 minutes
Purification using  GenepHlow Gel/PCR Purification Kit (Promega)
Chemically competent E. coli cell
Inoculate 5 ml glycerol stock of E. coli to 10 ml of LB medium
Incubate culture at 37˚C, 200 rpm for overnight
Transfer 1% of the overnight-grown cell into a new LB medium
Incubate culture at 37˚C, 200 rpm until it reaches OD 0.3-0.4
Aliquote culture into 1.5 ml microtube
Centrifuge at 3.0000 xg, 4˚C for 10 minutes, discard the supernatant
Add 480 µl cold CCMB buffer, and resuspend the cell pellet
Incubate on ice for 20 minutes
Centrifuge at 3.0000 xg, 4˚C for 10 minutes, discard the supernatant
Add 60 µl cold CCMB buffer, and resuspend the cell pellet
Incubate on ice for 20 minutes
Store at -80˚C until use
Heat-shock transformation
Incubate competent E. coli cell on ice for 10 minutes
Add 5-10 µl plasmid into 60 µl of competent E.coli cell, place on ice for 30 minutes
Incubate on 42˚C for 90 seconds for heat shock treatment
Place back on ice and incubate for 2 minutes
Add 600 µl of LB medium and resuspend
Incubate culture at 37˚C, 200 rpm for 3 hours
Centrifuge at 11.ooo xg for 1 minutes, and discard 550 µl of the supernatant
Resuspend the cell pellet with the remaining supernatan
Inoculate 50 µl of transformed E. coli cell  on LB agar medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics using spread technique
Incubate at 37˚C overnight
Specialized Protocols
pNPB Assay:
PETase activity were determined using this assay. The assay is adapted from 2012 UC Davis iGEM’s LC Cutinase pnPB assay. p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) is a substrate that contains an ester bond resembling the ester bond broken in PET degradation. PETase are expected to break the ester bond. The resulting product emits a wavelength of 405nm. pNPB was dissolved in acetonitrile at a concentration of 10 mM. Ethanol and 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0) were added to a ratio of 1:4:95 (v/v/v) of acetonitrile/ ethanol/ buffer. 0.3 mL of the bacterial culture was reacted to the 0.9 mL substrate solution. Then, it was incubated at 25oC for 15 minutes and centrifuge at 12,000g, 15 min, and 4oC . Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the change in absorbance 405nm.
Red Fluorescence Protein Assay:
The test will determine the effect of IPTG induction and incubation time regarding red color absorbance from E.coli BL21, Top10 and DH5α. These bacteria has already been transformed with RFP containing plasmid (BBa_J04450). Each of the bacteria strain was given two variations, induced with IPTG and not induced. This test was repeated three times for each variation. The red color absorbance was measure during 40 hours of incubation time at 588 nm.
SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope):
For biodegrading experiments, we used 1x1 cm2 bottle plastics with uniform average weight. The plastic sample were washed with water and ethanol. The plastic sample were mixed with Luria-Broth Medium supplemented with kanamycin. The bacteria containing PETase enzyme was the inoculated on to the medium and grown at 37oC. After 3 days of incubation, we washed the plastic with water and ethanol then dried for measurement with SEM.
Microtiter Biofilm Assay:
Adapted from this protocol.
