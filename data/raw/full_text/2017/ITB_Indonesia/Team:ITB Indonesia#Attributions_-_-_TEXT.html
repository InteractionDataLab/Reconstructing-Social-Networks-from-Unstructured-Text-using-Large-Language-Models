Acknowledgement
This project wouldn't be possible without commitment and dedication from many parties. It is our greatest pleasure to acknowledge the assistance and contribution of the individuals and groups who have helped us towards the successful completion of the project.
WORKS!
All the basic molecular techniques in the lab is performed by the students in the team. We designed the synthetic gBlocks, cloned them into vector, and performed the characterization of respective BioBricks.
Project Advisors
Dr. Maelita R. Moeis
Dr. Sony Suhandono
Project Idea
The idea is based on the previous ITB iGEM 2014 project which is called ColiPlaster. The 2017 team developed the idea for the optimization and novel enzymes.
We also get many inspirations from:
• Plastic Republic ,
• Team UC Davis , and
• PlastiCure
Project References
The main enzyme used in this project PETase is based on the research paper:
Yoshida S., Hiraga K., Takehana T., Taniguchi I., Yamaji H., Maeda Y., Toyohara K., Miyamoto K., Kimura Y., Oda K. 2016. A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly (ethylene terephthalate). Science 351:1196-1199
Wetlab Support
Azzania FIbriani, Ph. D as Head of Molecular and Chromosome Analysis Lab, School of Life Science and Technology, Institut Teknologi Bandung, who provided us lab spaces and permission to use the instruments inside the lab.
Dr. Tati Kristianti, M. Sc., as Research Assistant from Genetics and Molecular Biotechnology group SITH ITB, who assisted us in providing the kit, enzymes, and helped us in anything related to customs and online ordering.
