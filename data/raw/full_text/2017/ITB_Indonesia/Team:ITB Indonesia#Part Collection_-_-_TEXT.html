This is the parts collection designed by ITB Indonesia iGEM Team 2017.
:
Part Name
BioBrick
Description
Part Type
PETase
BBa_K2378001
This is optimized coding sequence of PETase enzyme for E. coli BL21.
Coding
IrrE Coding Sequence
BBa_K2378007
This is improved coding sequence of IrrE from BBa_K729001 (http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K729001). When transformed to E. coli, this protein protected from salt, oxidative, and thermal shock.
Coding
EndA Endonuclease Coding Sequence from Vibrio cholera
BBa_K2378008
This endonuclease degrades free extracellular DNA. The gene is isolated from Vibrio cholera.
Coding
pSal + PETase Coding Device
BBa_K2378004
ITB_Indonesia iGEM team 2017 designed a PETase enzyme coding device consisting of NahR-pSal regulatory part (BBa_J61051, http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_J61051) which is activated by salicylate inducer. In effect, PETase is only expressed when this device detect the presence of salicylate, which binds to NahR.
Composite
Constitutive PETase Coding Device
BBa_K2378005
This is optimized coding sequence of PETase enzyme for E. coli BL21 with the addition of constitutive promoter BBa_J23106.
Composite
NhaR-PETase Constitutive Coding Device
BBa_K2378006
This is an optimized coding sequence of PETase enzyme for E. coli BL21 with the addition of NhaR BBa_K1357002 (http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K1357002) coding sequence. NhaR enhances the transcription of pgaABCD operon which in turn induces the production of biofilm. This part also uses constitutive promoters BBa_J23106.
Composite
EndA Endonuclease Coding Device from Vibrio cholera
BBa_K2378009
This is coding device of endonuclease degrades free extracellular DNA, with constitutive promoter BBa_J61051. The gene is isolated from Vibrio cholera.
