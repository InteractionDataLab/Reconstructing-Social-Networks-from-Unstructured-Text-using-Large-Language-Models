Our goal in modeling is to predict system behavior and give insight to the wet lab team.
There are three main aspects of our modeling: 
</JUSTIFY></P><P><B>1) quorum sensing time to predict when biofilm formed</B></P><P><B>2) the rate of PETase production</B></P><P><B>3) PET hydrolysis by PETase with and without biofilm.</B></P> These aspects modeled, compared and fitted by the experimental data, thus giving numerical trends from the aspects before wet lab team does labwork in the lab.All models have data that needed each other. The rate of bacteria growth affects the amount of biofilm produced. According to our models, the rate of biofilm growth heavily depends on μ (specific growth rate) and the initial amount of inoculated bacteria. Bacteria produce mRNA, which influences PETase production until it reaches steady state. This steady state value of PETase production will be set as the initial amount of PETase in calculating the rate of PET degradation.<H1 class="ITB_h1" style="padding-bottom: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; border-bottom: 2px solid #1c2922 !important; padding-left: 30px; font-size: 30px; text-align: justify; color: #1c2922" id="quorum">Quorum Sensing</H1><P><JUSTIFY>Quorum sensing mechanism was used to form biofilm from <I>E.coli</I> strain Top10, BL21 and DH5α. We modeled the growth curve of <I>E.coli</I> to determine when <I>E.coli</I> colony should be moved from to reaction flask that contains PET. We also modeled coupled ODEs to growth curve, AI-2 production that affects signaling, and biofilm formation. AI-2 production in <I>E.coli</I> was used as colony signal of quorum sensing until it reaches specific points and finally form biofilm that affected by its quorum sensing by AI-2 signaling. We use Hill kinetics function as our approach to model AI-2 production and biofilm formation. Based on our model, also confirmed through experiment, the inoculation time until <I>E.coli</I> reaches quorum sensing condition is <B>5-6 hours</B>. We also found other parameter that <B>affect biofilm formation significantly. Namely, specific growth rate (μ) and initial amount of bacteria that will be inoculated.

 Transcription process of PETase is illustrated in Fig. 3:

Define M(t) and C(t) as functions versus time (in further discussions will be just written as M and C). Before going to differential equations that illustrate rate of mRNA (symbolized as M) and PETase production (symbolized by C), we made several assumptions for the model:</JUSTIFY><P>1.	No inclusion body is produced during the transcription. Consecutively, there’s also no TetR produced during the transcription.</P><P>2.	Initally, there are 0.05 μM of mRNA and zero amount of PETase.</P>

There, the differential equations of each parameter obtained through the analysis of mass balance are :

Our modelling does not look all reaction in pathway, but only PET degradation into ethylene terephtalate and 4-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)carbonyl]benzoate.

<P><JUSTIFY>Enzymatic reaction of PETase is thermodynamically favored (ΔG = -37.87 kcal/mol), so PET degradation will occur spontaneously without any trigger substance. PETase reaction is assumed to obey two mechanisms reaction, i.e. Langmuir adsorption isotherm that applied in hydrolysis reaction that using Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  One of the main reason for not applying all of mechanism Michaelis Menten kinetics in PET degradation mechanism was the involvement of heterogeneous reaction during hydrolysis [TJUSLS iGEM 2016 Team, 2016]. Based on Langmuir adsorption isotherm, we can derive mathematical expression that implemented to Michaelis Menten kinetics. </JUSTIFY>

Molecular weight of PETase is 30,247 g/mol, that relatively larger than oxygen (16 g/mol) or albumin (5,200 g/mol). Larger molecular weight makes value of diffusivity coefficient smaller. After diffusion, enzyme must create contact to PET surface so PET degradation will occur. Modeling of PETase diffusion and <I>E. coli</I> motility should modeled as stochastic model like Brownian motion, and we lack of data that we need. 
Biofilm that we used as media of <I>E. coli</I> to attach at PET surface based on our <A href="https://2017.igem.org/Team:ITB_Indonesia/Design">design</A> should be evaluated as channel to PETase can flow because molecular weight relatively large.
