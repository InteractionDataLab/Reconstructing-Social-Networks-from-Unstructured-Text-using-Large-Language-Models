pL-pLeft promoter-RBS-AmilCP-Double Terminator; BBa_K228004 : This composite part constitutively expresses amilCP under the control of hybrid promoter pL-pLeft. High efficiency ribosome binding site Bba_B0034 and double terminator Bba_B0015 are also integrated to this construct. This part expresses AmilCP in E.coli since pL promoter expresses constitutively in E.coli.
