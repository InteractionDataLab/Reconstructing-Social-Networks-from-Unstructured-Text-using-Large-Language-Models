Protocols
Media Preparation
LB liquid medium: 1000mL
Requirements
1L autoclave bottle or erlenmeyer flask
LB broth powder
Distilled or milliQ water
Magnetic stirrer and bead(optional)
Measuring cylinder
Autoclave tape
Cotton plug(for the flask)
Aluminium foil
Autoclaving machine
Procedure
In a 1L autoclave bottle or flask , add 25g LB broth powder.
Add distilled water to make the solution upto 1000mL.
Either Swirl or use magnetic stirrer and a bead to mix (might not dissolve completely).
Make a nice cotton plug by rolling and folding a big piece of cotton and put it on the mouth of the flask. (Try pulling it out once, if it makes a noise then ,Bravo!)
Put an Aluminium foil on top of it and a piece of autoclave tape
Keep the cap slightly open if using a bottle.
Autoclave at 121°C
Cool to RT before use. Do not tighten cap until cool.
LB agar plates: (~45-50 plates)
Requirements
2L Erlenmeyer flask
LB broth powder
Bacteriological Agar
Distilled or milliQ water
Magnetic stirrer and bead(optional)
Measuring cylinder
Autoclave tape
Cotton plug(for the flask)
Aluminium foil
Autoclaving machine
Petri plates
Procedure
Prepare 1L of LB liquid (25g broth powder per 1L) in a 2000mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Add 15g (1.5%) bacteriological agar
Use magnetic stirrer and bead to mix , if not available simply swirl to mix. Powder will not dissolve completely.
Make a nice cotton plug by rolling and folding a big piece of cotton and put it on the mouth of the flask(Try pulling it out once, if it makes a noise then, Bravo!)
Add a fresh piece of aluminum foil to cover the top, and add a fresh piece of autoclave tape.
Autoclave at 121°C
After cycle is complete, remove to benchtop to cool to ~50 C. (As a ballpark, this is still quite warm, but cool enough to leave your gloved hand on the outside of the flask for several seconds without burning it. The media should still be liquid but should be just beginning to thicken)
If you are adding antibiotics, add them at this point, and swirl the flask vigorously for several seconds to mix (1000 times dilution of the stock solution)
Set out your plates, and label the bottom with the appropriate antibiotic: A=ampicillin, C=chloramphenicol, K=kanamycin, T=tetracycline, S=streptomycin
Pour out the media into petri dishes as follows: Remove the lid to a dish, and remove the foil cover to the flask. Pour just enough LB agar into the petri dish to completely cover the bottom of the dish, then replace the lid.
Finish pouring dishes within 5 minutes of adding the antibiotic.
Dishes should be stored UPSIDE DOWN in the cold room.
