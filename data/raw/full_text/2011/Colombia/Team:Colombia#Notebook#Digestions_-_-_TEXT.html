Digestion Protocols
Double Digestions
2 hour incubation (37°C) followed by an hour incubation period at room temperature and another 2 hours at 37°C.
We used serial digestions to improve SpeI efficiency since it wasn’t working correctly as follows:
Ultrapure water
23.8ul
Promega ® Buffer D
4ul
XbaI
0.6uL
EcoRI*/PstI**
0.6uL
DNA
1ug
Final volume
40uL
We then purified the digestions using the Promega ® Wizard Sv and PCR Clean-Up system which were then eluted to 17.6 uL of ultrapure water or precipitated using Sodium Acetate and ethanol in ice.
Promega ® Buffer H
2uL
EcoRI**/PstI*
0,6uL
DNA
17,6uL
Final volume
20uL
[*] Plasmid opening [**] Fragment extraction
Run a 1% agarose electrophoresis for 55 minutes with 70V, and purify the expected weight bands using the Promega ® Wizard Sv and PCR Clean-Up system.
