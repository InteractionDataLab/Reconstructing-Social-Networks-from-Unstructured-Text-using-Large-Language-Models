Olga Pinzón Rodríguez
Olguita Pinzón
Olga is a Physics student at the Universidad de los Andes who wants to work in Cosmology and Nuclear Astrophysics. She got involved with Synthetic Biology through an advanced physics course, and she liked it so much that she decided to join this amaizing iGem team. Although Olga didn't know anything about how to work in a Microbiology Laboratory, she has learned pretty much and she spends some of her free time in the lab.
Thanks to iGem, Olga has known some friends and bacteria, but she's not very good at making jokes!
Gabriel Martínez-Gálvez
The Joy of Clowning Around
Gabriel is last year microbiology undergraduate student with a minor in physics and half way through a double major in biomedical engineering. He is also a gamer to the bone, and a heavy soccer and basketball fan. Since high school he found it fascinating and exciting to think about programming cells into living bio-robots automated to perform specific actions inside the human body. For that matter he found in systems biology and synthetic biology his main motivations for his studies and graduation thesis with the Biophysics Lab at the Universidad de los Andes .
He is very interested in the design of new biological processes through synthetic biology, dendritic cell information integration towards specific immune response coordination in humans as well as molecular psychology for a better understanding of emotions and aging phenomena.
Feel free to follow him on twitter or challenge him in PSN (PSN ID: ksk_89)!
Óscar Ortega

David Alejandro García Grisales
Deivid Alejandrou Garzcia Grisalues
is pursuing a degree in physics and mathematics as a member of the University of the Andes` class of 2014. David decided to participate in iGEM because he felt it would be an excellent opportunity to understand and manipulate the brick of the life to solve a big spectrum of problems. Outside the lab, David spends his free time playing the piano, reading some philosophy and literature, swimming. David also participates in a wide variety of academic activities such as in the “problem clinic” where he helps other students to solve difficulties in the resolution of problems in physics and being a prefect in a class of nanotechnology. After graduation, he wants to pursue a PhD in theoretical physics or nanotechnology. Check my video profile Here!
David Andrés Ayala-Usma
Red Bull gives you Wings!
David is a senior of Biology and junior of Microbiology that, one day, simply was in the right place to get involved with Synthetic Biology and became part of the team. He likes Molecular cell biology, Geosciences, Astronomy and some other science stuff. Also, he loves reading all kinds of tales and stories for children (like him), eating desserts, looking at the sky, taking pictures, playing at the PC, sleeping a lot, and talking, and talking, and talking... xD
He expects to eventually become a Ph.D. in Cell Biology, Earth Sciences or both, just to go around there talking about his favorite molecules, discovering new exciting things and earning money for that.
He also likes to be in contact with people around the world, and invites people with his same interests to add him on Twitter .
Roberto Carlos Lenis
Lenis
Roberto is a 19 years old, undergraduate student in Biology and Microbiology at the Andes University. He is fascinated by the regulation systems implied in cellular biology, especially with epigenetic processes and the post-transcriptional regulation systems as the RNA Induced Silencing Complex. Now that he is involved with Synthetic Biology he thinks it is one of the most powerful tools of these era, and he dream to work some day on a synthetic biology mediated response against pathogenic infections as HIV and Malaria.  In his experience trough IGEM he is focused on stracting the genes we need out of Vibrio fischeri to create the new biobricks for our project, he also may be a little bit distracted but the fines he payed for that and his work are really helpful.
He got involved with Molecular Biology in the 2002, at the Molecular Biology Estudy Center of the School Gimnacio Campestre in Bogotá [1] . There he worked on different projects including: The development of the Gorgona`s turtle karyotype, the stimulation of bioinsecticide producction by Bacillus thuringiensis by nutrient variations, the searching of new strains of Bacillus thuringiensis in the Colombian Andes, and the characterisation of the genes encoding for natural oxidation in some endemic plants of the Andes region. Now at the Laboratory of Mycology and plant Pathology of the Andes University, under the guidance of Dr. Silvia Restrepo and Dr. Adriana Bernal, he is working on preventing the natural browning of the fruits by silencing the expression of these genes.
Grad students (Also known as the Aging ones!)
Javier Tabima, M. Sc.
Oh noes, the wiki is down!
Javier is a Ph. D. student at the Laboratory of Mycology and Phytopathology and the Group of Computational Biology and Evolution at the Universidad de los Andes . He is a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science of the Universidad de los Andes where he worked with Molecular phylogenetics and population genetics. His main area of research is Bioinformatics and Molecular Evolution, but he does a little bit of wiki design and tech support once in a while. His role in the group is still unknown, but he does the best to give a little heads up, one or two practical jokes and to draw his lab mates as they work. Additionally, he likes to spend his free time doing slideshows and videos, so lets hope his hobbies are as useful as his bioinformatics knowledge.
A more serious profile Here - Only in Spanish! Sorry!!

Andrés Felipe Simbaqueba
Simbaqueba
Andrés Felipe was born in Florencia (and that’s at Colombia, not Italy...) and he is a Chemical Engineer and M.Sc student in Chemical Engineering at Universidad de los Andes. Actually, he has been researching in bioindustrial processes in order to produce biofuels from cellulosic biomass. He knew about iGEM through an advanced course in physics that he took last semester. He thinks that iGEM is a good opportunity to understand biological processes from a more scientific point of view. However, his life is not reduced only to full-time researching... also he spends his little free time going to the cinema, hanging out with some lucky friends, meeting new people and traveling around the whole world.

Where we come from
Bogotá is the main city and capital of Colombia. With at least 7 million inhabitants, its one of the world's largest cities . It is also the academic central of Colombia, and often called the Athens of South America due to the number of Universities and Libraries (106 Institutes of High Education). The Universidad de los Andes and the Universidad Nacional has been ranked in the top 500 Universities in the world.
Colombia is a country that has been stigmatized as a violent and problematic country, but in the last years the level of security of the country has improved significantly, and tourism has been one oh the main incomes due to the beauty and biodiversity (we are listed as having the fourth highest biodiveristy in the world and de first in amphibians and birds) of the country. Highlands, wet tropical forests and deserts are just two of our many landscapes. Diverse cities, town, and people, coasts in two oceans and the presence of the hugest natural forest (The Amazon) gives the country a touch of diversity and multiclimates, making this one of the culturally and naturally most blessed countries in the world.
People in Colombia are amongst the kindest and coolest people in the world. We are hard working, passionate, highly productive and the girls are beautiful.
We hope, with all our wishes, that you can come to Colombia, to understand and to have the experience of enjoying the Athens of South America!
