Gels for DspB

Figure 1: Gel proving the successful transformation of WT dspB from UBC into E. coli Top10. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-4: digests (EcoRI and PstI) of miniprep DNA from overnights of transformant colonies 1-3. There is a clear band at the appropriate size for dspB in all of the experimental lanes.
Figure 2: Gel of transformants that should contain both WT dspB and a promoter insert. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-4: WT dspB with PrsaA colonies 1-4; lanes 5-7: WT dspB with Pxyl colonies 1-4; lane 8: standard dspB with no promoter.
Figure 3: Follow up to Figure 2.  Gel showing WT dspB with various promoter inserts as contrasted to a standard dspB with no promoter. Lane 1: WT dspB + PrsaA colony 3; lane 2: with Pxyl colony 3; lanes 3,4: with BBa_K081005 colonies 3 and 4; lane 5: standard WT dspB; lane 6: ladder.
Figure 4: Test of more WT dspB with Pxyl colonies. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: WT dspB with Pxyl colonies 5-8; lane 6: standard dspB with no promoter.

Figure 5: Optimized dspB transformed into pSB1C3 colonies A-E. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: optimized dspB colonies A-E; lanes 6-9: optimized esp. Colony D shows the expected size.
Figure 6: More colonies of WT dspB with Pxyl promoter. Lanes 1-4: colonies 9, 10, 12, and 15; lane 5: dspB WT standard from PCR.
Figure 7: The rest of the PCR product of colony 10 from Figure 6 in preparation for gel extraction of WT dspB behind Pxyl. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2,3: WT dspB with Pxyl.
Figure 8: Gel of colony PCR of transformants carrying optimized dspB and rsaA C-terminal. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: transformation colonies 1-4; lane 6: dspB standard from PCR of WT dspB.
Figure 9: Optimized dspB + rsaA with Pxyl and PrsaA.  Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: PrsaA + optimized dspB + rsaA colonies 1-4; lanes 6-9: Pxyl + optimized dspB + rsaA colonis 1-4; lane 10: standard optimized dspB + rsaA. PrsaA + optimized dspB + rsaA colony 3 shows the expected size.
Figure 10: Colonies 5-8 of Pxyl + dspB + rsaA. Lane1: ladder; lanes 2-5: carry Pxyl + optimized dspB + rsaA; lane 6: standard optimized dspB with rsaA from PCR. None of these colonies were successful.
Figure 11: Lane 1: standard optimized dspB with rsaA from PCR; lanes 2,3: transformants that should carry WT dspB behind Pxyl; lane 4: ladder. No successful transformations.
Figure 12: BBa_K081005 + dspB + rsaA colonies 1-4.  Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: BBa_K081005 + optimized dspB + rsaA; lane 6: standard optimized dspB with rsaA fragment. Colony 2 is successful.
Figure 13: Pxyl + dspB + rsaA colonies 9-14. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-7: Pxyl + dspB + rsaA; lane 8: standard fragment of optimized dspB with rsaA.

Figure 14: Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: BBa_K081005, optimized dspB, and rsaA in pMR10; lanes 6-9: PrsaA, optimized dspB, and rsaA in pMR10; lane 10: standard DNA fragment of optimized dspB with rsaA. çolony 2 carries PrsaA + dspB + rsaA.
Figure 15: Gel of PCR of transformants that should carry Pxyl, optimized dspB, and rsaA. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-6: PCR products; lane 7: standard fragment of dspB with rsaA.
Figure 16: Gel of PCR of transformants that should carry Pxyl, optimized dspB, and rsaA. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-9: transformant PCR products; lane 10: digested miniprep of what should have been WT dspB, but showed up as the wrong fragment size.
Figure 17: PCR of transformants that should carry BBa_K081005, optimized dspB, and rsaA in pMR10. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-7: PCR products.
Figure 18: PCR of transformants that should carry Pxyl, optimized dspB, and rsaA in pMR10. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-8: PCR products.

Figure 19: Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-9: colony PCR of transformants that should contain BBa_K081005, optimized dspB, and rsaA.
