Gels for Promoters
2011.06.12-2011.06.18
Figure 1: Promoters Pxyl (inducible) and PrsaA (constitutive). Lane 1: ladder; lane 2: PrsaA; Lane 3: Pxyl. Bands appear, but are hazy and spread out due to the small size of DNA fragments.
Figure 2: PCR products of Caulobacter promoters PrsaA and Pxyl.  Lane 1: ladder; lane 2: PrsaA; lane 3: Pxyl.
Figure 3: Gel confirming that clean up did not remove DNA fragments. Lane 1: ladder; lane 2: PrsaA; lane 3: Pxyl.

Gel of Plasmid PCR of promoters. Presence of two small bands shows contamination of samples. Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-5: plasmid PCR of transformation survivors.
Gel of BBa_K081005 digests from minipreps. Lane 1: ladder; lane 2: digest of miniprep from overnights that should carry the desired promoter insert. Digest shows one band: the linearized plasmid.
Lane 1: ladder; lanes 2-4: plasmid PCR product of various promoter insertions into pSB1C3. Smearing due to leftover circular plasmid. Insertions seem to have been successful.
2011.06.26-2011.07.02
Test to ensure all of our restriction enzymes are still active.  Lane 1: ladder; lane 2: cut with Eco RI; lane 3: cut with XbaI; lane 4: standard uncut DNA fragment for lanes 2 and 3; lane 5: cut with SpeI; lane 6: cut with PstI; lane 7: standard uncut DNA fragment for lanes 5 and 6.  There is an apparent decrease in size from standard DNA fragments to the digested samples.  In the digest lanes there is also a dim band fairly far down the gel corresponding to the small end piece that is the other product of digestion.
