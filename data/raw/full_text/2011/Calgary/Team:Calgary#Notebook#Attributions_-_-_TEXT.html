All work on this project was done by team members of the University of Calgary's 2011 iGEM Team.  Original constructs from which to obtain genes to Biobrick were supplied from Dr. Anthony Schryvers Lab, Dr. Tung's Lab and the Chlamydomonas Database. Pseudomonas strains were provided by Dr. Moore from SFU and by Dr. Lisa Gieg from the University of Calgary. Supervision and direction was provided by faculty members, however all work was done by the team, during the months of May 2011 to present.  No work was done by other labs or individuals not related to the project.
