I have research experience related to the phytoremediation of the oil sands and as such, I hope I will be able to apply some of that knowledge to this project. I have never been involved in iGEM before, but I am very excited to be participating in the wet lab portion of it this year. I am positive that iGEM will be a great opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and to develop my independent research skills. Some of my interests outside of academia include playing competitive soccer, riding my bike and traveling.  </P><P><A href="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class="blue"><A name="ellen"><H4>Ellen Widdup</H4></A></SPAN><P>I am entering my fifth year (final semester) of Botany in the department of Biological Sciences. This is my third summer doing research and although I am new to the bacterial world I’m sure that my previous experience in molecular biology will be beneficial. This is my first year with iGEM and I will be involved in the wet lab portion. I am excited to work as part of the iGEM team in a rare interdisciplinary setting. I am very interested in oil sands remediation and hope that we will produce some useful results.

I will predominantly be helping out in the wetlab and marketing aspects of the project this season. I’m most excited about showcasing our project as well as teaching others on the team.  I am also very excited about working with a new group of people this year on a subject brand new to me.  I know that I will gain a ton of new knowledge this summer and have a chance to hopefully step out of my comfort zone and learn a bit more about modeling and website design.  In the fall I will be going into my fourth year of biomedical sciences, and I bring my previous lab experience as well as my theatre experience in public speaking to the team.  In my spare time I am involved in theatre in Calgary as well as competitive highland dancing.</P><P><A href="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class="blue"><A name="felix"><H4>Felix Chung</H4></A></SPAN><P>I'm a third year student in Chemical Engineering with a specialization in Biomedical Engineering. I take an avid interest in both engineering and biology, and I hope to be involved in both wet lab and dry lab aspects of this project. As this is my first year being involved with iGEM, I hope to make an impact by bridging the gap between the computational and wet lab requirements of synthetic biology research. Specific research interests before my involvement in iGEM include stem cell growth, tissue engineering, and chemical process optimization. In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin, tinkering with computers, and riding my bike. I look forward to getting to know everyone in Indianapolis and beyond!</P><P><A href="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class="blue"><A name="niko"><H4>Niko Hornbruch</H4></A></SPAN><P>I’m in my third year of Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Biomedical Engineering.

In the past three years my team has won three city championships and two provincial championships. iGEM is the first summer research I am involved in. While I don’t have prior knowledge in biology, I am looking to learn more about it this summer. My job in the team is to develop software applications to support the wet-lab work and to think of possible applications of our bacteria. </P><P><A href="#top">Back to top</A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><SPAN class="blue"><A name="patrick"><H4>Patrick Wu</H4></A></SPAN><P>I'm currently in my third year in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program (Bioinformatics stream) at the University of Calgary. This is my second year in iGEM and I am very excited to be a part of the team again. I believe that iGEM offers an amazing and rare opportunity for undergrads from multiple disciplines to come together and learn about synthetic biology first-hand. This year I'm working primarily on the drylab components of the project, as well as building this very wiki.

I am working towards finding genetic elements that acts as a specific and sensitive sensor for the environmental toxin, naphthenic acids.

The best part of this job is that there's a Timmies (Tim Horton's - a coffee and donut store) on the walk here, so I'm full of energy by the time I get to the lab.

This is my first year in iGEM and I will contribute primarily to the wet lab portion of the research, by identifying a suitable reporter for the naphthenic acids biosensor and in helping to create a promoter library using pseudomonas.
