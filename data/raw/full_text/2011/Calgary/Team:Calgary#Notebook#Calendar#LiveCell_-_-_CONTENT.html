Ultimately the reporter that was decided on was <I>LacZ</I> and the IPTG inducible promoter was decided on as opposed to pBAD for the purposes of testing the<I> LacZ</I> gene and characterizing it as an electrochemical reporter. </P><H3> Project Participants</H3><P> Saeed Qureshi</P><H3>July 12-15, 2011</H3><H4>Author: Saeed </H4><H4>Tuesday, July 12, 2011</H4><P>Spent the day going over all previous gels numbering the lanes and making legends. Also consolidated the images/results from the <I>E. coli</I> assay. Overnight cultures were set-up from the <I>E. coli</I> strains carrying the three constructs created the previous week.</P><H4>Wednesday, July 13, 2011</H4><P> Mini-prepped all of the cultures from the previous day and restriction digested them. These digests as well as some previous digests (which were used to make the constructs) were run on an agarose gel to confirm their identity. </P><P><B>Figure 1.</B> Restriction digests to confirm identity of parts. </P><H4>Thursday, July 14, 2011</H4><P> Discussed and planned out another <I>E. coli</I> viability/survival assay in NAs and made some autoclaved PBS buffer in preparation for it. Also according to the results of the gel from the previous day it was decided that the constructs made previously would have to be remade perhaps using other parts. Some more of the previous gels were also labelled in preparation for being posted on the website. </P><H3>July 16-22, 2011</H3><H4>Author: Saeed </H4><P>Saeed was camping from July 15-18, and was ill on the 21st.</P><H4>Tuesday, July 19, 2011</H4><P>In Preparation for the <I>E. coli</I> viability assay that was to be performed the next day the strain carrying the I0500_B0034_I732005 insert was cultured. The purpose of the assay was to determine whether or not the <I>E. Coli</I> could survive in the presence of NAs and therefore whether it would be practical to use it in the final biosensor. On this particular occasion the NAs were diluted in autoclaved PBS buffer rather than ddH2O, mainly because it was theorized that the inability of the cells to survive in the previous assays was because of the hypotonicity of the water. On a different note some TOP10 cells were transformed for Emily.</P><H4>Wednesday, July 20, 2011</H4><P> Performed the <I>E. coli</I> viability assay, which took most of the day.

I prepared a culture for use in the experiment. tried transforming  I0500 from the 2011 and 2010 registries and transformed R0010 from the 2011 registry. </P><H4>Tuesday, July 26, 2011.</H4><P>I ran a colony PCR on the cells transformed the previous day and on a streak plate of the cells carrying the contruct I0500_B0034_I732005.I subcultured the culture from the previous day until it reached log phase and then incubated the cells in CPRG and arabinose and monitored the response. The results of the experiment indicated that the cells were converting CPRG into CPR in the presence of arabinose. Details of the experiment are below:

</P><P>I performed a test on <I>E.coli</I> carrying the I0500_B0034_I732005 (arabinose promoter followed by LacZ reporter) to measure the conversion of CPRG into CPR.  The experiment was not kept  buffered at a constant pH of 7 at which pH the CPR would have have very good absorbance. Near the end though the pH was 7 presumably because the <I>E.coli</I> would have produced their own buffer and increased the pH with it.  At different pH's though, the solution has different optical density because of the indicator (CPR) used in the experiment. So the results may not be indicative of the level of CPR production over time.

Unfortunately, because the pH of the water samples were not measured, the actual standard curve at the pH from the July 26 experiment is likely to be different than the one measured above. The pH matters because chlorophenol red is an acid-base indicator which changes absorbency based on pH; at lower pH, the CPR turns yellow and has lower absorbency.   In future follow-ups, we will maintain a pH of 7. without a constant pH taking OD readings of CPR is not useful. </P><H3>  Friday July 29, 2011 â Friday August 5, 2011 </H3><H4> Author: Saeed Qureshi </H4><P><B>DATE CREATED</B> August 7, 2011</P><P><B>OBJECTIVE</B> Have a backup reporter system, in case there are complications with the electrochemical reporter system.</P><P><B>PROJECT/SUBPROJECT</B> Fluorescent reporter system</P><P><B>OBJECTIVE</B> Create IPT induced firefly luciferase and GFP reporter systems, since the I0500 constructs were not cooperating.</P><P><B>REFERENCE</B> Thursday July, 28, 2011</P><H4> SUMMARY OF ACTIONS TAKEN </H4><OL><LI> Miniprepped the R0010 culture (from Thursday) but obtained very low yield of plasmid DNA.</LI><LI> Samples of R0010, E0240, pSB1AC3, K325210 were all restriction digested in preparation for making constructs.

Also the primers used were actually not compatible with the plasmid carrying the E0240, so a different primers were also needed for the next PCR amplification of E0240 and this also meant that the construct R0010_E0240 also had to be amplified once further using the same primer which would be used for the E0240 PCR.</P><P>Â Â Though Figure 2 shows clear and distinct bands no real difference in length or size between the samples designated K325210 and R0010_K325210 can be seen.</P><P>Â Â Figure 3 shows that there is a size difference between the R0010_K325210 and K325210 and between R0010_E0240 and E0240.
