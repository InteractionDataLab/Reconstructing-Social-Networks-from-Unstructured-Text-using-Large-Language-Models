Taq PCR Protocol
The following is obtained from the Invitrogen Taq PCR kit (although most PCR kits have similar protocols).

Thermocycler Conditions
1 Cycle - 6 minutes at 95°C
36 cycles of:
1 minute at 95°C
1 minute at 58°C (this step done at 65°C for higher GC content )
1 minute at 72°C
1 Cycle - 10 minutes at 72°C then HOLD at 4°C
Conditions were varied as needed. For example in cases of longer products all 1 minute times were increased to 1.5 or even 3 minutes
Follow the same protocol for a colony PCR.
