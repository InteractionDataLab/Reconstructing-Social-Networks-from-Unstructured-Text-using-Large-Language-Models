Protocols
Safety
Chloroplast Isolation
This protocol will purify plasmids from bacteria, though identification of plasmids will need to be confirmed by PCR. The procedure is adapted from Mason, Bricker & Moroney et al. (2006) publication in Nature Protocols.
Reagents
HEPES (N-[2-hydroxyethyl] piperazine N'[2-ethane-sulfonic acid])
Sorbitol
Percoll
PEG 6000
Ficoll
Bovine serum albumin (BSA)
Isoascorbic acid
Sodium pyrophosphate
Glutathione
MgCl2.6H2O
MnCl2
Sodium-EDTA
Isolation Buffer (500mL)
27.4g of 300mM sorbitol
5.96g of 50mM HEPES-KOH (pH 705)
2mL 0.5M stock of 2mM Na-EDTA (pH 8.0)
0.1g of 1mM MgCl2.6H2O
5.0g of 1% BSA
Equipment
High-speed centrifuge and rotor
Spectrophotometer for chlorophyll measurements
Orbital shaker, light suitable for algal cell growth, and timer to control light settings
27-gauge * 0.5 inch stainless stell syringe needles
B-D Multifit 10mL glass Leuer-lock syringe
15mL Corex centrifuge tubes
Hemocytometer (cell counter)
Fine (artist style) paint brush
Protocol
Inoculate algal cells at a density of 4*10^4 cells/mL in 1L of minimal media. Grow cells under white light for 5 days.
Harvest the cells (0.6-1.0 * 10^7 cells/mL) by centrifuging at 3000g for 10 min at 4°C.
Wash the pellet with 100mL of 50mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) by mixing and centrifuging at 3000g for 5 min at 4°C.
Resuspend the pellet in 2mL of 50mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and hold at 4°C.
Measure the chlorophyll concentration of the cells by a spectrophotometer.
Dilute aliquots of cells with 3-0.3mg chlorophyll/mL using isolation buffer with 1% (w/v) BSA.
Quickly draw the diluted cells into the syringe, attach a 27-gauge needle, and pass through the needle at 0.1mL/s flow rate (~80psi).
Collect whole cells and crude chloroplasts by centrifugation at 750g for 2 min at 4°C.
Resuspend the pellet in 2mL isolation buffer using a paintbrush to prevent disruption of chloroplasts (smooth out any clumps).
Overlay the suspenion on top of the gradients and centrifuge at 4200g for 15min at 4°C, the chloroplasts are at 45-65% interface.
Collect the chloroplast band using a disposable glass pipet, dilute with 10mL isolation buffer with 0.1% (w/v) BSA.
Centriduge at 670g for 1 min at 4°C to collect the organelles to remove Percoll.
Resuspend the pellet gently using the paintbrush in 250 µL of 50mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0 with 0.3M sorbitol.
