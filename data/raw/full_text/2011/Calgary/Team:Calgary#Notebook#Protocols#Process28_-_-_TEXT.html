Testing For Oxidation
For this procedure you will need:
Freshly prepared buffer solution
Solution to be measured
Freshly plated electrode
Potentiostat with electrode adapter
AfterMath installed on a computer
This procedure will show oxidization of a compound and can generate standard curves. A picture of the potentiostat and connected electrode is shown at the bottom of the page.
Place the plated electrode into the adapter (the use of a blank spacer may be needed)
Place the connected electrode into the buffer solution and take a blank reading through AfterMath
Add the solution to be measured and test for oxidation through AfterMath
Dispose of all solutions and electrodes according to the policies in your facility
