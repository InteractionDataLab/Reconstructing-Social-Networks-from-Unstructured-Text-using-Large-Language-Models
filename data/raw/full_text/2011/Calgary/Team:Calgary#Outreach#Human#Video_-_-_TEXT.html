We are also in the process of creating a music video.  This will not be available on our wiki before the wiki freeze, but look for it after the jamboree on our YouTube channel!
iGEM Lyrics (to the tune of Katy Perry’s TGIF)
There are papers still unread,
There's a pounding in my head.
Lab coats with a funky stench,
Blue pipette tips on the bench
I smell like an agar plate
Kept on making these mistakes,
Enough is really quite enough!
Are these cells or fungal stuff?
GFP should glow, but my cells don't grow, I'm screwed, oh well
PCR's all blurred, but I'm pretty sure they grew! (Damn!)
Last project night,
Yeah we plated all our cells,
Filled in 96 small wells,
Think I overran my gels,
Last project night,
So we failed our PCRs,
And our constructs didn't scar,
Feel like hitting up the bar,
Last project night,
Pseudomonas in a flask,
Microalgae chloroplasts,
Off to start another task!
Last project night,
Yeah, I think we messed it up,
But we can't say we will stop op owwhoaa,
This project night, (do it all again),
This project night, (do it all again).
Got no data I can plot,
Don't know what to tell my prof,
All these enzymes in this box,
Better make another stock.
Think I broke a centrifuge,
Lab tech will not be amused,
And these plates are dry and stale,
That is such an epic fail.
