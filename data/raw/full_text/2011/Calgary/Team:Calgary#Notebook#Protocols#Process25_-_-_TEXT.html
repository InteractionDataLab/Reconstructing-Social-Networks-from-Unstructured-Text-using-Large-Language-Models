Electrode Plating
For the electrodes we used the Screen printed Carbon Electrodes from Pine Instruments. These electrodes needed to be plated in NiSO4 for our purposes.
Dissolve 0.2629g of NiSO4 in 10mL of nanopure water.
Stir until dissolved.
Place the electrode in the solution and apply a voltage of 1V for 20 seconds.
Let the electrode air dry until there is no more solution present on the electrode.
