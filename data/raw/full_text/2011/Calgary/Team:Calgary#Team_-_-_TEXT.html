About the University
Team
The University of Calgary iGEM Team consists of eight full-time and three part-time undergraduate students, two graduate advisers, and five facilitators. Along the way, we have received financial sponsorship from numerous partners including Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF) and the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI). We thank all of our sponsors for the contributions they have made to our project.
