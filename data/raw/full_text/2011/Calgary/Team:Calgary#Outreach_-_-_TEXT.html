Outreach
The University of Calgary iGEM team has been actively involved in outreach this year. We have spoken to people from all walks of life about iGEM and synthetic biology. From conferences to the Student Union to elementary level classes, our team this year has stepped up its game in terms of outreach.
Click here for a detailed breakdown of our human practices component this year. We've done some neat stuff this year, ranging from an in-depth report on government regulation of naphthenic acids to a music video that is currently under production.
Click here for a summary of the conferences which our team has attended this year. We got the opportunity to display posters about our project and even have a practice presentation in front of a panel of judges this summer.
