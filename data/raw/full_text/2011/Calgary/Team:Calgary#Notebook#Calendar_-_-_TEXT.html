Here you will find detailed records of our activities this summer. Just click the links on the right side of your screen, and check out all the cool things we've done in summer 2011. Activities are organized by project categories and then by weeks or dates. Entries from May to early July are all kept in a special section. Notebook entries from between the regionals and the finals are included in their appropraite project sections.
Our journal entries only include explanations for the motivation and significance of the experiments, and the relevant results. For detailed materials and methods, please refer to our Protocols section under the Notebook tab.
