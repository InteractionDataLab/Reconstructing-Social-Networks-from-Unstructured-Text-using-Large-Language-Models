Robert Mayall
Hey, I'm Robert, and I just finished my second year of Biomedical Science at the U of C. I've never done any kind of research work before so I'm excited to help out with the sensor system and have fun and create some mutants. The best part of this job is that there's a Timmies on the walk here, so I'm full of energy by the time I get to the lab. The summer will be awesome, working with some cool dudes and playing with science!
