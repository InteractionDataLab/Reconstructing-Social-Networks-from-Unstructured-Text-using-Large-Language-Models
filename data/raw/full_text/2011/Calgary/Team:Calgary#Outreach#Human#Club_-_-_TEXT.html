iGEM Club
The University of Calgary's Student Union has sanctioned a brand new iGEM Club! With this club we will be able to promote iGEM and synthetic biology to the student body at large. We will also have access to more resources and experience to help in setting up presentations and workshops that will educate the student body at the university about what we do in our labs and how they can join in on the iGEM fun. The club will also act as a base through which we can establish a permanent iGEM presence at the University of Calgary, meaning that we can continue to be involved in the fun of synthetic biology for years to come. The University of Calgary iGEM club will be an excellent opportunity to showcase our leadership skills and attract prospective members of next year's team.
