Parts Summary
This is a summary of the parts that we have submitted to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . These parts include a luciferase reporter, codon optimized for use in algae ( BBa_K640000 ), a heat/light-inducible Hsp70A/RbcS2 promoter also for use in algae ( BBa_K640001 ), our E. coli to Pseudomonas origin of transfer ( BBa_K640002 ), a Pseudomonas broad range host origin of replication ( BBa_K640003 ), and testing constructs containing ori1600 and our origin of transfer ( BBa_K640004 ), as well as ori1600 and a previously submitted origin of transfer ( BBa_K640005 ).
Since Regionals, we have also submitted our microalgae testing construct, containing our inducible promoter and our algae-optimized luciferase (BBa_K640007).  We also submitted our putative NA-sensitive promoter (BBa_K640008) as well as a construct containing this promoter region upstream of lacZ, for use in our electrochemical reporter system, all upstream of our E. Coli to Pseudomonas conjugation system (BBa_K640006).
