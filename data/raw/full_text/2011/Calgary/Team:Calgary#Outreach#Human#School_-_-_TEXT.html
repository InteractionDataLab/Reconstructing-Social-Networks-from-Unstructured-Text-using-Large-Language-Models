Bassano
Three members of the University of Calgary's iGEM team, Robert, Emily and Patrick, woke up at 5am on June 1st and travelled to Bassano, 140km from Calgary. Bassano is home to 1390 people. We visited the school in this rural community and taught students about the sciences, university, iGEM and synthetic biology. A picture of the school is shown below.
Wendy Hutchins, a leader of the local Let's Talk Science program at the University of Calgary, gave us great ideas for activities to do with the school children. We taught the older classes how to plate bacteria and made candy DNA helices with the younger classes. The candy DNA had pipe cleaner backbones and the children enjoyed eating their DNA afterwards.  Our three representatives had a lot of fun in Bassano and are hoping to go back next year for another visit!
