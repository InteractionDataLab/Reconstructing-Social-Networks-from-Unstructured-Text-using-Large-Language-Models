Preparation of f2 Media for Algae
This protocol is used to prepare f2 media for algal growth.
Stock solutions
NaNO3 (150.0 g/L)
Trace metals (mixed to 750 mL to dissolve, and then brought up to 1 L):  CuSO4.5H2O (19.6 mg/L), ZnSO4.7H2O (44.0 mg/L), CoCl2.6H2O (22.0 mg/L), MnCl2.4H2O (360.0 mg/L), Na2MoO4.2H2O (12.6 mg/L)
Na2SiO3.5H2O (22.7 g/L)
Fe citrate (both constituents added to the same 1 L: Ferric citrate (9.0g/L), Citric acid (9.0g/L)
Vitamin primary stocks: of Biotin (10.0 mg/100 mL) and vitamin B12 (10.0 mg/100 mL).
Vitamin working solutions (made fresh every three months) containing: 1.0mL primary stock Biotin, 1.0 mL Vitamin B12, 20.0 mg Thiamine HCL
NaH2PO4.2H2O (11.3 g/L)
Procedure
Add 0.5 mL of each of stock solutions 1-5 (listed below) to 1 L of seawater
Split into flasks and autoclave at 121 °C (15 PSI) for 15 minutes
Prepare phosphate solution (see below) and autoclave dilute phosphate stock at 121°C (15PSI, 15 mins). After cooling, dispense aseptically with sterilised automatic dispenser.  This component is autoclaved separately in order to prevent precipitation
