At all of these conferences, our team members learned a lot about both science in general and how to approach our project. We even presented our project at some, and posters at others! Talking to other scientists in various fields helped us to build networks and gain collaborations with other labs.
Our team is proceeding on to the iGEM World Jamboree at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts from November 5-7! We hope to see you there!
