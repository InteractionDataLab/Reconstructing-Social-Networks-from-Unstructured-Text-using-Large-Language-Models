About Calgary
Calgary is the largest city in Alberta, and has a population of over 1 million.  It was founded in 1875, when the RCMP erected Fort Calgary (then Fort Brisebois) to protect the western plains from whiskey traders. When the Canadian Pacific Railway reached the area in 1883, Calgary grew into an important commercial and agricultural center. Currently, Calgary's economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry, and major attractions include Canada Olympic Park (the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics), Calaway Park, the Lilac Festival, and the Calgary Stampede (an annual agricultural fair founded in 1905).  Calgary is also situated near the Rocky Mountains, and plays host to a unique weather phenomenom called the chinook. Famous Calgarians include the young, incumbent mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who is the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city, as well as the current Prime Minister of Canada, Conservative leader Stephen Harper.
The University of Calgary
The University of Calgary is ranked as one of Canada’s top comprehensive research institutions. Currently, more than 30,500 students are enrolled in 14 faculties in undergraduate, graduate and professional degree programs. The University contains more than 30 research institutions and centres, including the O’Brien Centre within which iGEM Calgary operates. The university is also the birthplace of many inventions including the neurochip, and has had 140,000 alumni since its founding in 1966.
The O'Brien Center for the Health Sciences
The O' Brien Centre for the Health Sciences campus is located in the Foothills Hospital, near the University of Calgary. It is responsible for providing the iGEM team with lab space as well as funding. The O’Brien Centre was founded by David O’ Brien, who is a member of the Board of Directors at the U of C. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch interdisciplinary research and education. It funds approximately 9 million dollars a year for research. The 2011 iGEM team thanks the O’Brien Centre for the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentships, awarded to three of our members, as well as lab space, materials, and equipment for this year.
