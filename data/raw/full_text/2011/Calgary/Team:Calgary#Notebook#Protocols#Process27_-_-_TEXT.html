Electrical Settings
For the generation of a standard curve we used a Pin Instruments WaveNow potentiostat. The accompanying software, AfterMath, was used to record the data. Below is a screenshot of the settings used during the experiment.
This range will accomodate the oxidation of chlorophenol red and give enough room to generate a sufficient standard curve. The 6 segments means that the data generated is in triplicate. Varying the sweep rate will alter the resolution of the graph, with smaller sweep rates causing higher resolutions.
