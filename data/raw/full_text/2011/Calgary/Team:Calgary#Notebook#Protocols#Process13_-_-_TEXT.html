Bacterial Transformation
Thaw 100 μL of competent cells (per transformation) on ice just before they are needed
Add DNA (max 20μl) thawed cells and mix by flicking the side of the tube. Leave on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock 5 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius
Place on ice for 5 minutes
Add 250ul SOC medium to each tube
Incubate for 30 to 60 minutes with shaking at 37°C. (Note that for Kanamycin containing plasmids always use one hour)
Spin down to remove all supernatant except approximately 100 μL
Plate approximately 30 μL on each of two antibiotic plates
Grow overnight at 37°C
For this protocol we used a couple of controls
Positive Control - pBluescript in TOP10 cells on ampicillin plates
Negative Control - TOP10 cells grown on ampcillin plates
