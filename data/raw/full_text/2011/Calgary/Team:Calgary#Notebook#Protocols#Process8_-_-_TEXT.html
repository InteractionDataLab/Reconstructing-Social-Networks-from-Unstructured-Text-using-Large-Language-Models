Nuclear DNA Extraction from Algae
Total DNA Isolation Protocol
Reagents and Materials
Extraction buffer (for 40 ml total):
1 M Tris HCl pH 7.5
8 ml
5 M NaCl
2 ml
0.5 M EDTA
2 ml
20% SDS
1 ml
ddH2O
27 ml
Elution buffer (provided in kit from Qiagen)
Protocol
Place 1.5 ml of algae culture into centrifuge tube.
Spin down cells at 5000 rpm for 1 minute.
Pipette off supernatant.
Add 400 µl extraction buffer.
Incubate for 15 minutes at 50ºC, inverting tubes several times during incubation.
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 5 minutes.
Transfer supernatant to new tube.
Add 400 µl isopropanol.
Invert several times.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 10 minutes.
Pour off supernatant and wash pellet with 500 µL of 70% ethanol, ensuring to resuspend the pellet.
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 1 minutes.
Decant ethanol and place tubes upside down on paper towel to dry off excess ethanol.
Dissolve pellet in 50 µl elution buffer, place tube on bench for 4 hours.
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 2 minutes.
Discard the supernatant, DNA is in the pellet.
