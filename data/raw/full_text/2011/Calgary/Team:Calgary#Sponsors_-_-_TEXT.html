The University of Calgary iGEM Team would like to thank our sponsors for generously helping us with our project:
University of Calgary and the O'Brien Centre for the BHSc
We graciously thank the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Centre for Bioengineering Research and Education for all their support.  We also wish to thank the Faculty of Medicine for their additional support as well.  Additionally, we wish to thank the office of the Vice President of Research for their gracious support.
The O'Brien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences is a part of the University of Calgary, located in the Foothills campus. It is responsible for providing iGEM team with lab space as well as funding. The O’Brien Centre was founded in part by a generous $5-million donation by David and Gail O’ Brien, after whom the Centre was named. David O'Brien has been a member of the University's Board of Governors, while Gail O'Brien has chaired the Faculty of Medicine's Dean's Advisory Council. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch research, interdisciplinary research, and education. It is responsible for providing approximately $9-million/year for researchers. The 2010 iGEM team thanks O’Brien Centre for its generous contribution of the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentship as well as lab space this year.
Alberta Innovates Technology Futures
