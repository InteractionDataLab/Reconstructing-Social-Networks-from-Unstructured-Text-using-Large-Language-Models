qRT-PCR
We have a 2X mastermix of taq DNA polymerase, SYBR Green, and dNTPs.  Primers are stored at 100μM and used at final concentrations between 200-600nM.  The PCR mix will be as follows:
qRT-PCR using Quanta PCR mastermix
Component
Volume
Quanta PCR master mix
5 μL
Primers (Fwd&Rev) at 600nM each
3 μL
cDNA
2 μL
Final Volume
10 μL
The following cylcing conditions are used.
2 min at 50°C
10 min at 95°C
40 cycles of:
15 sec at 95°C
1 min at 60°C
Melting curve analysis
15 sec at 95°C
