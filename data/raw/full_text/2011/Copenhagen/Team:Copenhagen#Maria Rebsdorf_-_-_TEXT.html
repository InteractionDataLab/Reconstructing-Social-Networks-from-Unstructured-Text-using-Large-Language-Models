Team:Copenhagen/Maria Rebsdorf
From 2011.igem.org
Name: Maria Rosholm Rebsdorf
Age: 22 years old
About me: Molecular Biomedicine student at my 3rd year.
Best iGEM experience: Making our own project has been the best experience ever! It has given me knowledge about new lab methods, introduced me to some awesome people, and less but not least, given me much more courage in the lab to do what I think is right.
Favorite superhero: Tintin - if he counts, or else... hmm.. CyperMan:D
