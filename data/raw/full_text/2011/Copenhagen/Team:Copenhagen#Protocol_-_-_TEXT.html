Mutations
Ingredients
Site directed mutagenesis of 3 plant CYP450 (79A1, 79A2, 79B1).
We aim to destroy restrictionenzymes recognitionsites.
Primers was supplied by IDT
10 μl of 5× reaction buffer
X μl (50 ng) of dsDNA template
X μl (125 ng) of oligonucleotide primer #1
X μl (125 ng) of oligonucleotide primer #2
1 μl of dNTP mix
ddH2O to a final volume of 50 μl
Then add
1 μl of X7 fusion DNA polymerase
Poly Chain Reaction
We ran a PCR to syntesise and amplify our mutated CYP's.
Cycling Parameters for the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Method
Cycles 12
Temperature 98°C Time 30 seconds
Temperature 55°C Time 1 minute
Temperature 72°C Time 30 seconds/kb of plasmid length
Digestion
We aim to remove the parentel CYP.
We take advantage of the fact that this CYP is methylated on cytosines. Dpn is a restriction enzyme that cuts DNA which is methylated - therefore our new mutated CYPs remain untouched.
1. Add 1 μl of the Dpn I restriction enzyme (10 U/μl) directly to each amplification reaction.
2. Gently and thoroughly mix each reaction mixture by pipetting the solution up and down several times. Spin down the reaction mixtures in a microcentrifuge for 1 minute and immediately incubate each reaction at 37°C (in a heater with lid or in a 37°C room) for 1 hour to digest the parental (i.e., the nonmutated) supercoiled dsDNA.

Double Digest
Of BioBrick with prefix and suffux in order to ligate it with a plasmid.   We have used two different approaches of the double digest. The differences are specified below as iGEM or Kenneth.
Ingredients
iGEM: 500 ng DNA / Kenneth: 700ng DNA
Water until 42,5 μl (43 ul if BSA is excluded)
5 μl NEB buffer (Decide which buffer: [2] )
0,5 μl BSA (Not necessary if the enzymes are HF)
1 μl Restrictionsenzyme A (Decide which restriction enzymes: [3] )
1 μl Restrictionsenzyme B
Mix by flicking
Incubate for 30 min in 37°C (BioBrick)or O/N in 37°C (Plasmid).
iGEM: Deactivate the restriction enzymes by incubating at 80 degrees in 20 min.
Kenneth: The restriction enzymes are deactivated and excluded when you purify the samples by gel electroforesis followed by gel extraction . This approach exclude the restrictionenzymes and other contaminations, but has aswell a down side - you loose some of the DNA.
Freeze until you need them. The BioBrick is now ready for ligation.

The BioBrick™ Assembly Manual from NEB and Ginkgo BioWorks http://ginkgobioworks.com/support/BioBrick_Assembly_Manual.pdf
Fourth Week
Gel Extraction Protocol
After gelelectroforesis cut out the DNA bands (approx.. 1600 bp). Visualize by ultraviolet light (this does not damage the DNA as the Imaganizer does).
Weigh the gelpieces.
Gel Extraction Protocol
Use 600 uL QG buffer pr. Gelpiece.
Incubate at 50°C until the pieces are meltet (approx. 10-15 min). Speed up the melting process by vortexing.
Add 1 gel volume (100mg ~100 uL) of Isopropanol (2-propanol) and mix.
Transfer the samples to QIAquick spin columns (max. 800 uL) and centrifuge for 1 min. For samples volumes of more than 800 uL simply load and spin again.
Discard flow-through.
Add 500 uL QG buffer and centrifuge for 1 min.
Discard the flow-through.
Add 750 uL PE buffer and centrifuge for 1 min. IF you are to use the DNA for blunt-end ligation or direct sequencing let the column stand for 2-5 min. before centrifugation.
Discard the flow-through
Spin again for 1 min and discard the flow-through.
Place the QIAquick column into an Eppendorff tube.
Eluate the DNA by adding 50 uL EB buffer. Remember to load the EB buffer in the center of the membrane. Let the column stand for 1 min. Centrifuge for 1 min.
Freeze the samples for later use.
You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook.  This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer.  It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
Digestion of Linearized Plasmid Backbones
This protocol is intended only for the preparation of the plasmid backbones (and NOT the expression vectors), before you can ligate it with your BioBrick.
25 uL Enzyme Master Mix
5 uL NEB Buffer 2
0,5 uL BSA
0,5 uL EcoRI
0,5 uL PstI
0,5 uL DpnI
18 uL H2O
Add 4 uL linearized plasmid backbone (100 ng in total)
Add 4 uL of the Master Mix
Digest at 37 degrees 30 min/O/N at 4 degrees.
We used two different approaches:
iGEM: Deactivate the restriction enzymes by incubating at 80 degrees in 20 min. You now have a plasmid concentration of 12,5 ng/uL  Kenneth: Purify the plasmids by gel electrophoresis followed by gel extraction .
Freeze until you need them. The plasmids are now ready for ligation.
Ligation Protocol
How to ligate a BioBrick into a plasmid backbone: Use 3 times insert (BioBrick) to 1 time plasmid (3:1) in molar amounts. In calculating the amounts of DNA consider the length of the BioBrick and the plasmid, see example below. Use 25-30 ng plasmid.
Note: iGEM are ligating eqimolar amounts of insert and plasmid as the only one in the world.
Following the two different approaches of digestion, where you obtain different concentrations of the DNA, use either iGEM or Kenneths procedure for ligation. See below.
Use eppendorf tubes for the ligation, so you can add the competent cells directly into the tubes.
Example:
pSB1C3: 3000 bp
CYP79B1: 1600 bp
3000/1600 ≈ 2 (molar ratio)
25 ng/2= 12,5 ng (25 ng and 12,5 ng are equivalent molar amounts in grams)
In this procedure we use 3 times excess of insert (B1):
12,5 ng *3= 37,5 ng B1
iGEM
2 uL digested plasmid (12,5 ng/uL)
x uL digested BioBrick (10 ng/uL)
1 uL T4 Ligase buffer
0,5 uL T4 DNA Ligase
Add water to a final volume of 10 uL
Our iGEM way
x ul digested plasmid (25 ng)
x ul digested BioBrick (~40 ng if the insert is half the size than the plasmid)
1 ul T4 Ligase buffer
0,5 ul T4 DNA ligase
Add water to a final volume of 10 ul
Ligation O/N at 4 degrees
Kenneth
If you wish to use Kenneths digestion approach, you have to determine the concentrations of the BioBrick and the plasmid by NanoDrop.
x uL gel extracted plasmid (25-30 ng)
x uL gel extracted BioBrick
2 uL T4 ligase buffer
0,5 uL T4 DNA ligase
Add water to a final volume of 20 uL
Ligate at room temperature for 10 min/Ligation O/N at 4 degrees
Keep on ice until transformation.
To ensure that the ligation has succeded make at least two different control saples:
C1
1 uL T4 ligase buffer
0,5 uL digested plasmid
8,5 uL H2O
C2
1 uL T4 ligase buffer
0,5 uL digested plasmid
0,5 uL T4 ligase
8 uL H2O
Transform the controls as if they were a real transformation containing a BioBrick.
Transformation Protocol for pSB1C3
The only exeption to the procedure is an incubation step after adding the LB medium. Incubation for 1 hr. at 37 degrees while shaking.
Plate it on agar plates with chloramphenicol.
PCR of BioBrick in pSB1C3
4 uL HF buffer
0,4 uL 10 mM dNTP
1 uL 10 pmol/uL primer A
1 uL 10 pmol/uL primer B
0,2 uL x7 polymerase
Add water uptil 20 uL
Use a pipette tip to collect cells from the plate, and transfer it to the PCR mix. End by scrabing the tip against the inner surface of the PCR tube.
PCR Program
10 sec - 98°C
30 sec - 68°C (The annealing temperature must never be higher than the extension temperature)
30 sec - 72°C
∞      - 12°C
29 cycles
Note: The annealing temperature is determined on the basis of the sequence of the primer. Use the calculator . Remember that the BioBrick has been shortened in the double digest, so it misses 8 bases. The primer still has theese 8 bases that don't anneal, and they should be excluded in the calculation. The annealing temperature must never be higher than the extension temperature (because of the length of the primers the annealing temperature calculated will probably be higher than the extension temperature, and should therefore be lowered)
Note: The extension time should be 30 sek/kb
