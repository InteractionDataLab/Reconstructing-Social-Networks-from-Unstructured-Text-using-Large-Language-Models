Where we're from
UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN's iGEM team consist of 5 Molecular Biomedicine-, 2 Biochemistry- and 1 Biotechnology undergraduate(s)
MOLECULAR BIOMEDICINE:
Molecular Biomedicine is a branch of medical science that applies biological and other natural-science principles to clinical practice. Biomedicine involves the study of patho- and physiological processes with methods from biology, chemistry and physics with the particular point of view of devising new strategies for diagnosis and therapy. The program in Molecular Biomedicine is one of Denmark's elite programs, with extra funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology. The curriculum is focused on experimental work with the molecular biology of human disease and is a joint effort between the two faculties of science and health, both on the same campus in Copenhagen.
BIOCHEMISTRY:
Biochemistry is a wide field involving the study of living systems, their composition, and chemical makeup and reactions. This includes the processes for how living systems obtain energy, react to disease and pass characteristics from one generation to the next. Biochemistry has a wide range of applications, from studying plants in order to create disease or drought-resistant crops, to studying diseases in order to create better medicines.
BIOTECHNOLOGY:
Biotechnology is a field of applied biology that involves the use of living organisms and bioprocesses in engineering,technology, medicine and other fields requiring bioproducts. Biotechnology also utilizes these products for manufacturing purpose. Modern use of similar terms includes genetic engineering as well as cell- and tissue culture technologies. The concept encompasses a wide range of procedures (and history) for modifying living organisms according to human purposes — going back to domestication of animals, cultivation of plants, and "improvements" to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection and hybridization.
