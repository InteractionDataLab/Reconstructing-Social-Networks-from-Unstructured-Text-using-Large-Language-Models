From 2011.igem.org
Name: Casper de Lichtenberg
Age: I am 22 years old
About me:I have been studying biochemistry for 2 years. I am currently very busy with a course in Protein Science. Other than iGEM work and studying I keep myself busy doing work for the student counsil of biochemistry and being boss of the revue for molecular biomedicin and biochemistry students.
Best iGEM experienceI see the iGEM competition as a great way to prepare myself both mentally and skillwise for other projects that may pop up in the future and I really feel a lot more confident in the lab now.
Favorite Superhero: Patrick Larsen - The everyday superhero
