Team:Copenhagen/Eva Meier Carlsen
From 2011.igem.org
Name: Eva Meier Carlsen
Age: 22 years old
About me: I'm an explorer. I am eager to learn everything about the magnificent world which we inhabit. Everything around my astonishes me - cause who are we and what will become of us. I belive - and hope - with all my heart that an education in molecular biomedicine will provide me with the background and academica that I need to establish a basis of knowledge to understand and explore the unknown aspects of life
Best iGEM experience: When asked a question like this, I remember the first time I heard about iGEM. I thought to myself - what an oppertunity to do something on my own, without a lab manual to guide me through every single step. For the first time in my very short scientific career, i was able to think! I don't know how well it went, i'll let the future judge that, but I sure enjoyed the ride. I put learning into practice and I saw what science was all about - at least better than any science fair ever showed me.
Favorite superhero: Donald Duck - everything I know I owe him.
