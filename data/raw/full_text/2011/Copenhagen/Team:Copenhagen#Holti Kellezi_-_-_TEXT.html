Team:Copenhagen/Holti Kellezi
From 2011.igem.org
Name: Holti Kellezi
Age: 22 Years Old
About me: I am a student at the University of Copenhagen, studying molecular biomedicine on my third year.
My main reason for participating in iGEM was to gain a rich and beneficial insight into the world of collaborative and entrepreneurial science. iGEM has been a unique chance to experience the different processes needed to succesfully design, execute and present a scientific project.
