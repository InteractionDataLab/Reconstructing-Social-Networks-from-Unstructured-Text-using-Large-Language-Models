Open Source
By open source, we mean the free accessibility to information about genetic material, protocols for working with it and the ease and standardization of the methods used.
Are there any problems associated with open source biology?
Which advantages could open source have for scientific community and society in general?
On a timescale of 100 years, will it be possible for people with no professional training, to do genetic manipulations of organisms at home?
If yes: what are the perspectives for this development?
What are the dangers and possibilities with kitchen genetical biology.
Should it be regulated and how, if possible, could we do that?
If no: What are the obstacles for genetic manipulations at home?
