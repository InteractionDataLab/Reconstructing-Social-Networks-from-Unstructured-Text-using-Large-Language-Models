Team:Copenhagen/Mikkel
From 2011.igem.org
Name: Mikkel Morsing
Age: 25 years old
About me: I'm studying molecular biomedicine at The University of Copenhagen. I'm at my third year, and about to begin working on my bachelors project.
The main reason for me to participate in iGEM, was to try a new approach to science, to see biology from an engineers perspective and to gain experience with lab-work. This has proved to be fun and instructive.
Best iGEM experience: To have experienced how a project evolves from idea to actual product, and Hipster-style beer drinking with team iGEM'ers in the most hipster spot in Copenhagen, Dronning Louises Bro.
