Team:Copenhagen/Mette Vistesen
From 2011.igem.org
Name: Mette Vixø Vistesen
Age: 22 years old
About me: I'm a student at University of Copenhagen where I study molecular biomedicine. Beside spending my summerhollidays in the laboratory working on our iGEM project and now working on my bachelor project, I dream about learning french, climb the mountains in Nepal and convince my sister that biology is very exiting.
Best iGEM experience: This summer I have learned much about how to develop a project from the very beginning and how to execute it. Beyond that I have enjoined the great afternoons in the park with beers and snacks.
Favorite superhero: Without doubt Lucky Luke (does he count?).
