Import Info
  "The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method."      
About iGEM Nevada
 
We are a group of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology undergraduate students from the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) who will be representing the state of Nevada for the third time in the world-wide iGEM 2011 research competition in MIT, Boston. Team Nevada 2009 won a bronze medal for their category and Team Nevada 2010 won a silver medal. We believe iGEM Team Nevada 2011 could bring home a silver or a gold medal this year!
