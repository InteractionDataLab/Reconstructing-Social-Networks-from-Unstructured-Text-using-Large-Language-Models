Hexokinase coupled assay used to quantitate amounts of cyanobacteria glucose secretion.  Rxn: 1. glucose + ATP --Hx-> G-6-P + ADP      2. G-6-P + NAD+ --G-6-PDeH-> G-6-P + NADH Reaction used Glucose assay kit (Genzyme) containing 2000U/L Hexokinase reagent and 4000U/L G-6-P DeH and measured  glucose concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm. Results: Final NADH concentrations were determined using the molar extinction coefficient and were proportionate to intial glucose concentrations. Discussion: Focus is now to measure not only glucose, but fructose concentrations as well as both with be secreted in the form of sucrose using a D-glucose/D-fructose assay (Megaenzyme)
