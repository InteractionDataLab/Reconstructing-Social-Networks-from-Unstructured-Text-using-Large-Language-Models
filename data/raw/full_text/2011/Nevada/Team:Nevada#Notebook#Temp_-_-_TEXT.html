E. Coli
Lab clean-up, media preparation.  Registry distribution received from iGEM Headquarters.  Prepared DNA from iGEM kit for future use (pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pSB1K3 and σ70 constitutive promoter).

Hexokinase coupled assay used to quantitate amounts of cyanobacteria glucose secretion.
Rxn:
1. glucose + ATP --Hx-> G-6-P + ADP
2. G-6-P + NAD+ --G-6-PDeH-> G-6-P + NADH
Reaction used Glucose assay kit (Genzyme) containing 2000U/L Hexokinase reagent and 4000U/L G-6-P DeH and measured glucose concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm. Results: Final NADH concentrations were determined using the molar extinction coefficient and were proportionate to initial glucose concentrations. Discussion: Focus is now to measure not only glucose, but fructose concentrations as well as both with be secreted in the form of sucrose using a D-glucose/D-fructose assay (Megaenzyme).

Week 2 - June 6th-12th
E. Coli
Transformed iGEM plasmids (pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pSB1K3) and σ70 constitutive promoter (J23101) into NEB10 β strain of E. coli (New England Biolabs).  Inoculated single colonies in LB-Ampicillin to create liquid cultures.  Performed minipreps and nanodrop analysis of cultures.
To confirm products, 0.5ug of DNA was digested with EcoRI.  Digestions were run on a 1.2% gel, and bands obtained confirmed pSB1C3 (2070bp), pSB1A3 (2155bp), pSB1K3 (2204bp), and σ70 constitutive promoter (35bp).

Assay for ethanol detection. Simple one-step assay takes ethanol and NAD+ into acetylaldahyde and NADH with use of alcohol Deh (ADH) enzyme. Final NADH concentration can be determined using its molar extinction coefficient and absorbance at 340.0 nm, and is proportionate to initial ethanol concetration.  Ethanol concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-0.25mM were assayed with 173U/mL ADH.  and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm.
Results: Final NADH concentrations were calculated to be off by a factor of ten due to unexpectedly low absorbancies. Assay was repeated with increased ethanol concentrations (0.5-10mM), but absorbancies remained lower than expected.
Discussion: It was determined that this assay was now sensitive enough for the range of ethanol concentrations that will need to be detected in our project, therefore we will use other means of ethanol detection using simple primary alcohol detection methods using oxidizing reagents.

E. Coli
Pyruvate Decarboxylase & Alcohol Dehydrogenase
JC:  Received pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase (PDC/ADH) genes (3054bp) on 6/14/11.  Genes were in pUC57 plasmid (AmpR, 2710bp).  Transformed PDC/ADH/pUC57 into NEB10 β cells and selected single colonies from LB-Ampicillin plates.  Grew liquid cultures in LB-Amp and performed minipreps and nanodrop analysis.
To prepare PDC/ADH for insertion into pSB1C3, 0.5ug of DNA was digested with EcoRI and PstI.  Digestions were run on a 0.7% agarose gel, and bands obtained confirmed PDC/ADH (3054bp) and pUC57 (2710bp).
Performed QIAquick PCR Purification of PDC/ADH- EcoRI/PstI digest and pSB1C3- EcoRI/PstI digest using 0.5ug and 0.25ug of DNA respectively.  Ligated PDC/ADH and pSB1C3 and transformed into NEB10 β cells.  No cells grew on LB-Chloramphenicol plates =(

E. Coli
Pyruvate Decarboxylase & Alcohol Dehydrogenase
JC:  Re-attempted transformation of PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 into NEB10 β cells.  Selected single colonies from LB-Chloramphenicol plates and single colony streaked onto LB-Chl and LB-Amp plates to perform plasmid check.  Grew liquid cultures in LB-Chl and performed minipreps and nanodrop analysis.
To confirm PDC/ADH insertion into pSB1C3, 0.5ug of PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was digested with EcoRI and PstI.  Digestions were run on a 1% agarose gel, and bands obtained confirmed PDC/ADH (3054bp) and pSB1C3 (2070bp).
PDC/ADH/pSB1C3 was sent to Nevada Genomics Center for sequencing on 6/23/11.
Cyano
Promoters and integration vector for Synechocystis from iGEM Utah State received. Promoters/integration vector in pSB1C3 used to transform E. Coli. Cultures streaked and grown overnight. Colonies selected from streaked plates, liquid cultures grown overnight. Liquid cultures miniprepped to isolate plasmids. Digestion using EcoR1 and Pst1 performed on each of isolated plasmids including INV ang GLF, gels run and imaged. LB with 30% glycerol stock prepared for freezing of E. Coli. An apparatus for growing Synechocystis was prepared using a flask and glass tubing connected to an aquarium pump to aerate the culture. Synechocystis was grown in a photobioreactor for four days, and the OD730 was measured once a day to determine growth. Synechocystis was grown in BG-11 medium with either 0% glucose or 50 mM glucose. Over four days, the OD730 did not change for either type of culture. This indicates that the Synechocystis did not grow, and that modifications to the growth apparatus are necessary. A larger volume of culture is necessary, as well as a humidifying device.
