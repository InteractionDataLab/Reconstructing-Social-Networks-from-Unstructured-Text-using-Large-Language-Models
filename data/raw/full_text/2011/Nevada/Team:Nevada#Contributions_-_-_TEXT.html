Major Advisers: Dr. Christie Howard and Dr. David Shintani.
They helped us out by organizing meetings every week, provided feedback on proposed projects, both were available over the summer for help in the lab, developing assays, outlining cloning strategies, and other project related help, they set up individual meetings with us for help on our project, they wrote grants to Nevada INBRE (NIH) to help fund the iGEM registration and for travel, both professors helped in proofreading of posters and wikipages, and Dr. Howard helped out with the News Updates by interviewing us and proofreading our final drafts.
Additional Advising: Dr. Patricia Ellison
Dr. Ellison taught the iGEM assay group how to develop assays for analysis of alcohol.
Dr. Ellison attended meetings in the spring semester and gave us feedback on project proposals.
