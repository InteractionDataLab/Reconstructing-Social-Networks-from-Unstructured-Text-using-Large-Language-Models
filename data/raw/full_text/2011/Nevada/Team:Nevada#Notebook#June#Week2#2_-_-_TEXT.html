                     -----------------------
                             Assay for ethanol detection.  Simple one-step                     assay takes ethanol and NAD+ into
                             acetylaldahyde and NADH with use of alcohol                     Deh (ADH) enzyme.  Final NADH concentration
                             can be determined using its molar extinction                     coefficient and absorbance at 340.0 nm, and
                             is proportionate to initial ethanol concetration.
                             Ethanol concentrations ranging from 0.05mM-                     0.25mM were assayed with 173U/mL ADH.
                             and absorbances were measured at 340.0 nm.
                             Results: Final NADH concentrations were                              calculated to be off by a factor of ten due
                             to unexpectedly low absorbancies.  Assay was                       repeated with increased ethanol concentrations
                             (0.5-10mM), but absorbancies remained lower
                             than expected.
                             Disscussion: It was determined that this assay                     was now sensitive enough for the range of
                             ethanol concentrations that will need to be                     detected in our project, therefore we will use
                             other means of ethanol detection using simple                     primary alcohol detection methods using
                             oxidizing reagents.
