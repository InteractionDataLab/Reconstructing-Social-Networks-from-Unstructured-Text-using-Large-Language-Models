We characterized the ability of the CD7 peptide to nucleate the formation of QDs in E. coli by incubating the bacteria with CdCl and sodium sulfide. Although the E. coli treated in this manner showed visible fluorescence, the intensity did not appear to change in the presence of the inducer IPTG, nor was the brightness greater than that of E. coli carrying the expression vector with no peptide insert. The possible explanations for this are:
The peptide does not nucleate QDs under the conditions described in the literature (the literature is in error)
We deviated in some unknown way from the protocol in the literature.
The QDs might not emit at the wavelengths that the microscope was able to recognize due to its set of filters. We did not have access to a fluorimeter.
But we were amazed that after 3 hours of cadmium treatment the bacteria appeared alive and well!
