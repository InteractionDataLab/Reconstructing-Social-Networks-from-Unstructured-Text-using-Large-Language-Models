Young as we are,
only dreams can be the wings.
Where is the will,there is the way.
Everytime we fail
Everytime we want to say
no we can't
or even
Sometime when we feel
everything we have done are nothing
but the moon in the deep well
Someone is there...
PLEASE ALLOW US TO GIVE OUR THANKS TO:
The University of Science and Technology of China Initiative Foundation
Teaching Affair Office of USTC
School of Life Sciences of USTC
Graduate School of USTC
School of Chemical and Material Science of USTC
