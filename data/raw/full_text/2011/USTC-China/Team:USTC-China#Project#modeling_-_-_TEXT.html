We have been working hard to model our system.
Before presenting our results, we would like to say that lasR protein is assumed to be always over production in our system, although it is not in our original design, it really helps a lot to simplify our modeling work.
Suggestions and questions are welcomed, for contact, you can email to PJH_panda(jhpanda@mail.ustc.edu.cn) or any other member of our team.
All codes are written in Python26( http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.6/ ), you can download our codes here File:IGEM USTC 2011.zip , you will need Scipy( http://www.scipy.org/Download ), Numpy( http://www.scipy.org/Download ), and Matplotlib( http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ ) to run our codes.
Now see what we have done
Firstly, we would like to present some basic character of our system. For this part, the genetic design is a Toggle switch with a regulatory ci. We use lasI/lasR repressible promoter here.
In a single cell, the system acts   like a fast switch upon AHL concentration, on the other hand,   cheZ ouput is a slow switch of theophylline concentration.
We can see that cheZ concentration   rises rapidly when AHL concentration rises from 3nM to 4nM. For   the switch is so fast that we can use quorum system in our   design. CheZ output rises relatively rapid when theophylline   concentration is around 210nM.
For the system without quorum part,   If AHL concentration is low, regulate ci protein accumulates,   the toggle switch is in the ci state, cheZ production is very   low, so the cell can rarely move. And when AHL concentration is   high, not enough regulate ci protein is produced, the toggle   switch is in the ci434 state, cheZ production is high, so the   cell can spend less time tumbling, and will move  to the   direction where cheZ concentration rises.
Following pictures show how steady-state cheZ concentrations   change under conditions of different AHL and theophylline   concentrations （t = 64800）.
            
                   Fig. 1
Following pictures show the switch's performances under different max transcription rate of ci mRNA (t = 43200). 1 means 0.1*k1, 2 means 0.2*k1, and 3 means 0.3*k1
    
                   Fig. 2
Following pictures show how cheZ concentrations change on time under conditions of different AHL and theophylline concentrations (t = 43200).
            
                   Fig. 3
Following pictures show how a single   cell moves on time under conditions of different AHL and   theophylline concentrations in one single round of   simulation (t = 72000).
            
                   Fig. 4
Following pictures show how a single   cell moves and how cheZ concentration changes by time under   conditions of different AHL and gradient of theophylline   concentration (30,600) in one single round of simulation (t = 72000).
AHL = 10 nM
            
                   Fig. 5
AHL = 3 nM
            
                   Fig. 6
Secondly, we want to see the movement of 100 cells (or more) without quorum part under 10nM AHL and theophylline gradient (25,500)
Assume that 100 cells are around the center for 0.25mm distance at most. Following pictures shows the position of the 100 cells without quorum part under 10nM AHL and gradient of theophylline concentration (25,500) after t = 86400. And a little movie is shown

                   Fig. 7
Thirdly, after the previous two modelling part, we believe that if we add quorum part into our system, the results will be acceptable.
For the whole system with quorum   part, in the beginning, we assume that the concentrations of all   related macromolecules are zero. Cells begin to divide, cell   number is growing, and AHL is accumulating, when AHL   concentration is high enough, toggle switch in some of the cells   turns to the ci434 state, and these cells is moving out. After   some time, AHL concentration in these cells will drop, and the   toggle switch will most likely turn to the ci state, cells stop   moving.
For this part we assume that initial cell number is 20, and numbers   of the cells grow under the rate of k=0.97*exp(-t/5), the unit   of time is hour.
In the beginning, max transcription rate of regulatory ci mRNA is set as k1. However, we found cheZ concentration keeps dropping during simulation time. So we set it to be 0.3*k1, this will not change the basic character of bistable switch. From the first part of our modeling, AHL acts as a fast switch between 3nM and 4nM. If we set max transcription rate of regulatory ci mRNA as 0.3*k1, the switch is between 1nM and 2nM.
For no gradient of theophylline

When adding intrinsic noises (fluctuations of promoters) into our system, it seems that the result is improved a little.
            
                   Fig. 10
After several days' work, it seems that we have improved the performance of our system in some aspects.
First of all, the negative feedback of regulatory ci is moved and a positive feedback of regulatory ci is added. This design is described as this, aptamer-cheZ is added downstream of ci434-gfp, and lasI is added downstream of ci-rfp and an AHL positively regulated promoter is in use. We can see from the following picture that the AHL switch performance is enhanced.
Following two pictures shows how steady-state cheZ concentration changes under different values of AHL concentration and delta. The first picture showing below shows the AHL switch performance, delta is 0.3 here. For the second picture, delta means max transcription rate of regulatory ci is set as delta*k1, AHL concentration is 10 nm here. Compared to previous negative feedback (Fig. 1), the switch performance is improved. Simulation time is 43200.
            
                   Fig. 11
In the situation of following picture, cell number growth rate is constant (0.97), and initial cell number is 20. Noises are included.

The real AHL concentration is not the AHL produced. Considering about fast diffusivity of AHL, we assume that external AHL concentration is zero, although it is not quite exact, but it can describe the character of AHL well. That is, for cell i, the compact of cell j is,
            
Tumbling frequency of a cell is determined by its cheYp concentration
            
CheYp concentration is related to cheZ concentration, and for the reaction is so fast, we assume that current cheZ concentration determines current cheYp concentration
            
We assume that cells move at the speed of 0.025um/s on our semisolid plate. For the movement of a single cell, if the cell tumbles, it will stay of the current second, and change its direction later, if not, the cell keeps on moving in one direction.

For cell number growth, here, we assume that the growth rate drops by time, the unit of time is hour
