Conclusion and Discussion
    Comparing with the control, the reprogrammed bacteria actually can destroy the target bacteria as the design requires and basically decrease the range of motion of the target bacteria.
    By measuring the range of motion of the control and the target bacteria dealed with the reprogrammed bacteria from different tubes(tube1, tube2, tube3, tube4), we get histogram below.
Figure13.
    Figure13 shows that the capability of eliminating the target bacteria grows with the number of bacteria with red fluorescen decreases. This result reveal a fact that the properties of the reprogrammed bacteria mainly depend on the random fluctuation of the expression of the Toggle Switch Device.This fact also explain the differences between the form of the colony1 from tube2(Figure10 left) and the colony1 from tube3(Figure12 left)
