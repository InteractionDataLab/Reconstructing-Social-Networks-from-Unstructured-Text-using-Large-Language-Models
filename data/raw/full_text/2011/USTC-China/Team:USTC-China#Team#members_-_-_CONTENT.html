I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. As a metabolic disease, diabetes-related proteins tend to enter the circulation system, thus the biomarker discovery in plasma has the potential to play an important role in the early detection and treatment of diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum. In addition, I have planed to analyze the genetic and environmental factors and their interactions during the progressing of the type 2 diabetes with systems-biology approaches.</P></DIV><DIV class="bio" id="jhbio"><H1>Jiong Hong</H1><P>Hong Jiong</P><P>Mail: hjiong@ustc.edu.cn</P></DIV><DIV class="bio" id="zflbio"><H1>Zhaofeng Luo</H1>

Synthetic biology is a powerful tool to realize fantastic thoughts root in everyday life. As a fanatical fan of systems biology and microbiology, it's a pleasant journey for me to dive into this world of innovative design and challenging experiment. Besides, iGEM is the coolest game of modeling and presentation. I enjoy it so much~


</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="swlbio"><H1>Siwei Luo</H1><P>I am a senior student majoring in systems biology in university of science and technology of China.Excellence in learning is not only in my biological field ,but also in many other subjects which I am interested in ,such as history ,mythology ,philosophy and Linguistics. Especially in the language learning ,I have learned German ,Japanese ,Italian and a little Egyptian hieroglyphs by myself. In my own professional field ,I particularly focus on the studying of systems biology and synthetic biology ,therefore ,besides learning and studying in the Computational Biology Laboratory of USTC ,I also took part in the iGEM(International Genetically Engineered Machine) team to design the blueprint of the project ,experimental protocols and safety standards.</P></DIV><DIV class="bio" id="zlcbio"><H1>Zhilin Chen</H1>
 Hi~My name is Zhilin Chen 
 and I'm a sophomore student in life science department of USTC. Greatly attracted by synthetic biology, I chose to take part in iGEM2011 team,UTSC-China.I have learnt a lot about Synthetic Biology and practiced my experimental skills through the process. I believe it's worthwhile to spend time and energy to our promising project, which will certainly pay back. As for myself, outgoing, optimistic, considerate are all my characters,yet sometimes I could be really sentimental and depressed. Now I'm looking forward to the 2011 Jambooree and making friends with all of you.

Hi,everyone!I am Zhao Fangzhou, a sophomore student majoring in Life Science in USTC. Born in the autumn of 1991, I was lucky enough to enjoy a 21-year life filled with happiness and sadness. Shangrao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, is the very place where I was brought up. This beautiful town, positioned in Southern China, with its natural scenery and cultural heritage, has been teaching me how to handle with my own life and with the whole world. Over the years before, I have developed interests in a variety of occupations, like reading books, playing computer games and various ball games. However, since the day I was admitted into USTC, I began to devote much of my time to studying, and correspondingly cut down the time spent on after-class activities, expecting that two years later, I can walk out of this university without any regret. </DIV><DIV class="bio" id="shlbio"><H1>Shaohua Li</H1>

Hi, I'm Mengping Sun, an IGEMer of team USTC-China. This is my last year as an undergraduate student and I am pround of being an IGEM fan. IGEM not only marks a start for my reserch career but also is a good way to meet many friends from all over the world. As for me, I am a person who love sports, movies and chatting with others. Being an IGEMer is lucky for the world becomes smaller when we have one commom dream. And it's a great honor to fulfill it in MIT.

Hello, everyone, I’m Yufeng Luo, an undergraduate from USTC-China team. My major is Chemistry. I’m honored to join the IGEM2011 competition, the memory of which will never be forgotten in my life.During last seven months I’ve being studied and worked with our teammates. In our project, I take part our experiments in constructing our system. We spent lots of time together, it’s not happy all the time, but every minites is meaningful. As The Grand Final coming,we are confident to have a good result. Best wishes(∩_∩).

Hi,I'm Anlina,and my Chinese name is also Linna An.
I am now a new sophomore in USTC,the department of Chemistry and Material Science.
I designed the wiki,completed it with my friend Yuntao Liu,and did some experiments with other teammates.But the most valuable experience is that I participated a complete project,which will definately help with my career.
Not everything is easy,but there is always others to help.Not every day is happy,yet all the difficulties made what we are.When there is will,there is way!
Also,I love PS and Flash,hope to play with you guys.

I think, it must be very exciting to find and understand the principles of how macromolecules organize in universe. In iGEM lab and compubio lab, you can try to build your own principles for bacteria and for macromolecules. Badminton is my favorite sport, and Defense of the Ancients is my favorite computer game.
