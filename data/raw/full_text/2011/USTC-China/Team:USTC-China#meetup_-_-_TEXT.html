Team:USTC-China/meetup
From 2011.igem.org
Chinese teams began to participate in this event from 2007. The number of Chinese teams has increased to 20 from only 4 at the beginning. Considering that the new teams are lack of experience in the 2011 competition and a platform for communication and cooperation between teams is badly needed, a meeting for all Chinese iGEMers 2011 China Meetup was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th.
