RNA-based genetic control elements that regulate gene expression in a
ligand-dependent fashion without the need for proteins. Herein, we collect theophylline aptamers and their molecular analogues aptamers including adenine, xanthine, 3-methylxanthine, hypoxanthine and caffeine. All these sequences are available in supplemental data. We want to find out correlations among those aptamer sequences and build versatile expression platforms for required aptamer. In order to achieve these goals, we classify the aptamer sequences by analyzing their secondary structures and identify the consensus sequences by sequence alignment (BLAST engine).Finally, we reveal the riboswitches function and structure relationship and suggest design principles for creating new synthetic riboswitches and their platforms.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Analysis">Analysis</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Theophylline">Theophylline</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Classify">Classify</SPAN></H4><P>First, we predicted the secondary structure of the theophylline aptamers by mfold. Then we found that the aptamers can be classified into 3 categories by their secondary structure shapes. The first category aptamers have two loops, the second category aptamers have three loops and the last category aptamers have complex secondary structures which cannot be classified by the number of loops (Figure 1).</P><P align="center">Figure 1A.

To find out the consensus sequences, we did the sequence alignment in each categories by Clastalw2 and the alignment indicated that the conserved sequences have varied length in different groups (Table 1)(Figure 2B). The alignment results are available in the supplemental data.</P><P>TABLE 1. Consensus sequences finds in sequences alignment

From this alignment, we identified that the conserved sequences have the same location in the whole aptamers and the aptamers do have the same consensus sequences except several complex long aptamers. Notably, the previous work by Gallivan has reported the same motif sequences (Figure 2). </P><P align="center">Figure 2A.The two motifs have been reported by Gallivan.</P><P align="center">A High-Throughput Screen for Synthetic Riboswitches Reveals Mechanistic Insights into Their Function DOI 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.12.008

Actually, the sequences alignment also indicates the sequences have relatively long consensus sequences. In guide tree diagram 3, there are less sequences than diagram 1 and 2. And the consensus sequences are quite short since the comparatively long sequences in diagram 3 are different, especially sequence 27. </P><P>From the whole sequence guide tree diagram, we found that sequences in category 1 are mixed with sequences in category 2. Thus, the classification by the sequences secondary structure may not restrict in the phylogenetic analysis perspective. The sequence 27 which is different from the other sequences in diagram 3 shows evolutionary change in the whole sequences diagram. </P><P>Figure 3A. Guide tree 1</P><P>Figure 3B.

The possible switching mechanism in which extensive paring in the region near the ribosome binding site prevents translation of downstream genes have been demonstrated by de Smit and van Duin.</P><P>Therefore we reconsider our previous work and the result suggests that only relative long aptamer sequence would fold to different conformation. Besides, the longer the sequences are the lower free energy the aptamer would have. And the most aptamer sequences we have collected are only the target sense section which can bind the target molecule but cannot fold into different conformations. That is, we should design the action section to accomplish the aptamer’s function. </P><P>Combing to the sequence alignment, we find that the consensus sequences locates in the region which would interact with the target molecule. As we expected, the results suggests the ligand-binding conform to the structure –function relationship.  </P><P align="center">Figure 4.

a region near the ribosome binding would decrease the upstream gene expression which would be used to improve the aptamers’ performance (Figure 5). Notably, we use the mfold to predict the secondary structure of the aptamer which has been reported by Gallivan but cannot get the expected two varied conformation.</P><P>Figure 5.

From the results, we classified the aptamer sequences into 2 categories by their secondary structure. The sequences in the first category have the same secondary structures which have been usually reported and studied as the adenine apatamers. The sequences in the second category have varied conformation and owing to their relatively long sequence, they can fold to complex conformations.</P><P><A href="/File:Ustc13.png" title="File:Ustc13.png">800px</A></P><P>Figure 6A.One of the category1 aptamer secondary structure</P><P>Figure 6B.One of the category2 aptamer secondary structure</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sequence_alignment_2">Sequence alignment</SPAN></H4><P>To locate the consensus sequences and probe correlation between adenine apatmer sequences and theophylline aptamer sequences, we did sequence alignment in each categories and whole sequences (Table 2) (Figure7) .

We thought the data which have been collected are not well processed.</P><P>We compared the adenine aptamer sequences alignment results with theophylline, we found that there are more consensus sequences locating in different region and the entire adenine aptamer sequence show complex structure.

Thus, sequences in category 1 more similar than category 2 since the sequences in category 1 have the same secondary structures. However, the sequences in category 1 and 2 mixes in the whole sequences guide trees. Since the adenine aptamers have completely different secondary structures from theophylline, we didn’t compare adenine aptamer with theophylline.</P><P>Figure 9A. Guide tree 1.

One is ydhL A-riboswitch and the other is add A-riboswitch. Both of them have the same secondary structure which have been demonstrated by our previous prediction (Figure 6A).</P><P>A remarkable feature of the ligand bound scaffolds is the formation of a junctional core involving five stacked triples (Ronald R. Breaker,3 and Dinshaw J. Patel1et al.2004). The crystal structures show that the bound ligand is directly involved in a Watson-Crick base pair at position 65 making this residue particularly important. Our sequence alignment also indicates that position 65 is consensus sequence.</P><P>Notably, the structure-function relationship in adenine aptamer would be more precisely described by their crystal structure nut not the secondary structure. In fact, we cannot predict the two conformation of the adenine aptamer by mfold.</P><P>Figure 10.

  However, from the comparing results, we found that different aptamers have varied consensus sequences and secondary structures. Thus, the aptamer sensor sections have little or nothing in common. Therefore, we should contain the sensor section and design the standard versatile platforms in our future work.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reference">Reference</SPAN></H3><P>1.Shana Topp and Justin P.

The method used is based on the data analysis of collected aptamer sequences.</P><H3>Design Constrains</H3><P>Designing a aptamer sequences at low background level of the gene can be achieved by increasing or decreasing the stem and loop structures.

Because, firstly, we want to keep the secondary structure as designed as close as possible to the original aptamer. Besides, we want to simplify the design process and putting the requirements into our design would greatly reduce the solution space.</P><P>The previous analysis showed us that changing the stem region would influence gene expression in the absence of the target molecule without losing their function. However, it’s unclear if it can achieve the function when we change the other part. In fact, the more we change, the bigger risk that it lose its function to bind the target molecule.</P><H3>Loop Region Design</H3><P>There are basically three original aptamer sequences loop.
