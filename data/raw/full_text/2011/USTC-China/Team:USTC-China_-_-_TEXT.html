Built a complex system composed of basic biobricks in which remarkable control of bacteria movement can be realized.
We have successfully built biobricks of vital gene in chemotaxis and compatible riboswitch for theophylline.
We have contributed to modulating existing biobrick and take advantage of its flexible ratio in our project.
We have developed innovative application of our basic design.

Project
+ Details
Construct a novel system in which bacterial colonies will automatically divide into two parts after certain time & Assemble Riboswitches finely tuned by small molecules and Toggle Switches pushed on and off.
Modeling
+ Details
Bulid a model of our system to verify our design and help constructing new systems. & Analyse  Riboswitches invovled in our systems.
Team
+ Details
We are USTC-IGEMers from variant departments and grades and build our project together. We have a happy summer together and would like to share it~
Human Practice + Details
In our project, we have always been focusing biosafety and issued our own Biosafety protocol. Furthermor, we found speacail groups and conduct surveys and open days to get people informed of synthetic biology.
