All of the citizens that visited our lab have contributed to helping us complete this activity, so the sample was expanded to people aged from 12 to 45, which is much bigger than last year. To make the results more convincing and meaningful, we have made introductions about this field and iGEM in advance. The content of the survey goes as follows.</FONT></P><P><FONT size="4" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS' ,'Arial','Helvetica' ,'sans-serif';">1. Your attitude towards genetically engineered food (GMF) is:</FONT>
a. Completely resistant though its price would be very low;
b. A little resistant but you will accept it on condition that the advantage in cost is distinctive;
c. Treating both GMF and normal food equally;
d. Valueing GMF more than the normal.
</P><P>The result can be seen in the following diagram:
</P><P>
2. What is your initial response when face with gene manipulation?
a. Terrified; 
b. Worried; 
c. Curious; 
d. Proud.
</P><P>Result:
</P><P>From the above we can reach the conclusion that most people in our city hold a positive view towards gene manipulation, which is encouraging because due to our work in iGEM 2010 most students in our school more than a half of the students resist genetically modified food and are terrified when hearing that something is genetically modified.
</P><P>3. Do you often hear about gene manipulation this year?
a. Often, and I would seek for relevant information;
b. Often passively hear about it;
c. Occasionally;
d. Never.
</P><P>Result:
From the diagram we can tell that in contrast with the wide awareness of students in our school, general citizens are obviously more ignorant about gene manipulation. It is a warning bell for us researchers because it is them that consist most of the society.
</P><P>4. What aspect do you think will be largely struck by gene manipulation?
a. Ethics;b. Biological evolution;c. Human health;d. Environmental pollution;e. Others
</P><P>Result:
</P><P>It shows that most people think biological evolution, ethics and human health will be largely impacted, which is also our concern.
</P><P>5. Will you consider the influence of your work that may affect the future society (environment, ethics, health, etc.) when doing scientific research? (For students only)
a. I will, and I will adjust my working process according to it;
b. I will consider part of it, but not if it may affect the result of my research;
c. Not at all.
</P><P>Result:
</P><P>This question shows a fact that most of our future generation is responsible for the environment and the whole human beings when doing scientific research. We can draw the conclusion that there is much hope for our future as long as advanced technologies are used properly.
</P><P>Conclusion
From the data above we can summarize that most of our citizens are able to get to get to know synthetic biology as a brand new scientific approach. It is clear that no matter how the world changes what we need is always an environment that can function well in spite of the uneasiness caused by various technical progresses. Since we have discovered that most people are not that against gene manipulation, it is not that hard to make the whole society believe that we are doing the same thing.
