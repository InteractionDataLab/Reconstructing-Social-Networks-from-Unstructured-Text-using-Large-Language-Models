 \(^o^)/ and I'm a sophomore student in life science department of USTC. Greatly attractied by synthetic biology, I chose to take part in iGEM2011 team,UTSC-China.I not only learnt a lot about Synthetic Biology,practiced my experimental skills,also, I believe it's worthwhile to spend time and energy to our promising project, which will certainly pay back. As for myself, outgoing, optimistic, considerate are all my characters,yet sometimes I could be really sentimental and depressed. Now I'm looking forward to the 2011 Jambooree and making friends with a common goal.

Hi,everyone!I am Zhao Fangzhou, a sophomore student majoring in Life Science in USTC. Born in the autumn of 1991, I was lucky enough to enjoy a 21-year life filled with happiness and sadness. Shangrao, located in the northeast of Jiangxi Province, is the very place where I was brought up. This beautiful town, positioned in Southern China, with its natural scenery and cultural heritage, has been teaching me how to handle with my own life and with the whole world. Over the years before, I have developed interests in a variety of occupations, like reading books, playing computer games and various ball games. However, since the day I was admitted into USTC, I began to devote much of my time to studying, and correspondingly cut down the time spent on after-class activities, expecting that two years later, I can walk out of this university without any regret.

 is a rising sophomore at MIT, studying Biological 
Engineering. He’s participating in iGEM because he’s fascinated by the 
idea of manipulating and programming biological life as a system of 
circuits.  Prevous to iGEM, he’s worked in a biochemistry laboratory, 
purifying enzymes and synthesizing deuterated RNA for structure analysis 
and has also had programming experience. In his free time, he serves as a 
Tour Guide, Treasurer for the MIT 2014 Class Council, and Vice-President 
of his fraternity. After graduation, he hopes to work at a local 
biotechnology company.

Hi, I'm Mengping Sun, an IGEMer of team USTC-China. This is my last year as an undergraduate student and I am pround of being an IGEM fan. IGEM not only marks a start for my reserch career but also is a good way to meet many friends from all over the world. As for me, I am a person who love sports, movies and chatting with others. Being an IGEMer is lucky for the world becomes smaller when we have one commom dream. And it's a great honor to fulfill it in MIT.

Hello, everyone, I’m Yufeng Luo, an undergraduate from USTC-China team. My major is Chemistry. I’m honored to join the IGEM2011 competition, the memory of which will never be forgotten in my life.During last seven months I’ve being studied and worked with our teammates. In our project, I take part our experiments in constructing our system. We spent lots of time together, it’s not happy all the time, but every minites is meaningful. As The Grand Final coming,we are confident to have a good result. Best wishes(∩_∩).

I am the clerk and the manager of USTC-China 2011 iGEM team.I also participated in the experiment of constructing the prompter, aptamer, cheZ and GFP together.I feel this enjoyable all the time.

Hi,I'm Anlina,and my Chinese name is also Linna An.I am now a new sophomore in USTC,the department of Chemistry and Material Science.I designed the wiki,completed it with my friend Yuntao Liu,and did some experiments with other teammates.But the most valuable experience is that I participated a complete project,which will definately help with my career.Not everything is easy,but there is always others to help.Not every day is happy,yet all the difficulties made what we are.When there is will,there is way!

I think, it must be very exciting to find and understand the principles of how macromolecules organize in universe. In iGEM lab and compubio lab, you can try to build your own principles for bacteria and for macromolecules. Badminton is my favorite sport, and Defense of the Ancients is my favorite computer game.

I am Wang Yanyue from Department of Material Science and Engineering. You can call me Era for short. In our team I am in charge of the Human Practice part and also make my contribution to performing some experiments. The reason why I joined the team was that biology is so mysterious and fancy for an outsider like me, and I wish one day I may be able to untangle some of the fascinating enigmas of living creatures.Well, it is a bliss that we are living in such a wonderful world with so many lovely people caring about each other. We are so young and have the hearts to live what seemed impossible and challenging. As long as we have enough courage and wit, we are the ones who can make a change!

My name is Xiaolei Zhang,an undergraduate of system biology in USTC. While I began to cast doubt on the my conviction of studying biology,synthetic biology with the iGEM came to touch me, fascinating me with its innovative application of engineering idea in biology.In retrospect,all the diverse elements in this iGEM trip make me to see biology and scientific research from a refreshing point of view.Anyway,whether our research is serious enough,I take it seriously and cherish this iGEM trip.
