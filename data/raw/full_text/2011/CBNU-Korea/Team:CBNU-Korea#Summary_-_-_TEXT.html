The core technology of synthetic biology is designing synthetic genome. it is involved in several processes which are design, chemical synthesizing and transplantation into artificial cellmembrane.  Synthesis of genome and transplantation into another cell were succeeded already. By contrast, there is no design process of genome, and it has not been succeeded. Above all, It is important to design of genome. Because functions of genome can be changed with selecting certain genes, arrangement and so on, successful designing to genome is needed to knowing genome organization. Therefore, We are supposed to analyze into genome organization about essential genes at DEG(Database of essential genes). We think that analysis of genome organization of all genes is very complex and difficult at present. That is why we decide to analyze several essential genes reducing a range of all genes that we have to analyze. In addition, We try to develop a program which designs minimal genome based on the Analysis results and it is named GOD(Genome Organization Database and Designer).
Our final goal is to make a synthetic minimal genome finally. Minimal genome is consisted of the least essential genes to live in only specific surrounding. And cells transformed with Minimal genome have several utility values to industry. Because these cells only consume energy to living and producing some products what user want, user can obtain a high yield of product when user add genes which is wanted to insert into minimal genome.
