From 2011.igem.org
To design the Synthetic Minimal Chromosome of a bacterium, that the information on essential genes, such as direction, position, length and function, is essential. In addition a new analyzing method which calculates the distance between replication origin and each essential gene (DTO; Distance to origin) in each species, and provides the number of essential genes within 10 percent of total genome size are required. Using this method, we confirmed a distribution of essential genes in each organism.
In this study the information of essential genes will be obtained from DEG (Database of Essential Genes). We will re-group essential genes by COG distribution for construction of our database which is connected to a software named GOD (Genome Organization Database & Designer).
