For design the Synthetic Minimal Chromosome, we need to get information of essential genes such as direction, position, length and function in order to design chromosome.  However, it is difficult to design to use only information of these. So, we should have a new analyzing method which calculates distance between replication origin and each essential gene(DTO; Distance to origin) in each specie and get the number of essential genes within 10 percent of total genome size. Using this method, we confirmed a distribution of essential genes in each organism The information of essential genes is obtained from DEG(Database of Essential Genes) and re-group essential genes by COG distribution for construction our database which is connected to a software named GOD, Genome Organization Database & Designer.
