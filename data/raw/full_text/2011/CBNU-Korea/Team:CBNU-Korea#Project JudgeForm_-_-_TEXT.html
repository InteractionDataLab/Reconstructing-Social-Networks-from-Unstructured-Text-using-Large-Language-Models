AND Either develop a new standard or use SBOL
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the: (check all that apply)
design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
