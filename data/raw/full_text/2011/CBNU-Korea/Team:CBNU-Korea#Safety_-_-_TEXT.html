From 2011.igem.org
a. The software, the genome database, and the genome design tool which we plan to use are already in public domain. Therefore we do not need to establish additional limited access for biosecurity.
b. Our database has only essential gene data that the organism must have for survival. The information will be obtained from the DEG database ( http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/ ). In addition most pathogenic genes are not essential genes. In case any pathogenic gene is included in the essential genes, we will establish limited access of gene database for biosecurity. There is no domestic regulation in Korea on obtaining the sequence of pathogenic genes.
c. In order to prevent any intentional abuse of pathogenic gene information (if which are included in this study), first, we will not make a disclosure of pathogenic or toxin gene data to our database. Second, the genome design tool developed will be released only with an official request from the head of the organization or department which should include nation, affiliation, group, name of PI, purpose, address, contact information (address, telephone, e-mail), etc. .
