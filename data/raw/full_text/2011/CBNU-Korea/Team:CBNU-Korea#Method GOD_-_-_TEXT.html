Essential Gene?
All of the organism must have essential genes for surviving in environment. All essential genes have specific essential biological function such as replication, transcription, translation and metabolism, etc. The essential gene is an element of genome, also life.
what we try to, with essential genes?
If user wants to have characterized microbes, user should has to know what genome of the organism has, and then should design the microbe genome. For characterized alive microbes, they must have several essential genes. So we try to develop software that can help user design artificial genome or chromosome with several essential genes which is in our essential gene database.
Data Parsing
Stored MySQL Database Using Java & BioJava
Data Processing
Making Essential genes Pool
Analogy of Essential genes
If the analysis method of 15 species of DEG is applied, other essential genes in many organisms which are not finished the Genome project could be analogized by using the information of the analogized essential genes in DEG.
Analysis of essential genes
The study on the Essential gene’s position of microorganism species of 1500 about origin. We analysis NC file’s various parameters (Strand, Direction, COG, EG, DistToOri, etc.) to study distribution of essential gene. The Strand, Direction, COG, EG, DistToOri was used from the various parameters.
