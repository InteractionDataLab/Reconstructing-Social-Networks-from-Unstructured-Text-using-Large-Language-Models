Team:CBNU-Korea/Project HumanPractice
From 2011.igem.org
Media Attention: We published an article in Korean language to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM competition to all universities in Korea. To do this we gathered a simple description of the projects of all 4 iGEM teams from South Korea (KAIST , Korea Univesity , CBNU, UNIST) and finally summarized it. We believe that this article would reach all universities of Korea and would motivate few other undergraduates to join hands for Synthetic Biology. Visit http://www.ksbb.or.kr/home/kor/ for more details.

Collaboration with UNIST_KOREA Team:
CBNU_KOREA Team & UNIST_KOREA Team held a regular meeting once at a month . We shared our idea and discussed how to prepare for iGEM competetion. They helped us a lot in terms of modeling. We provide a sequence analysis and other molecular analysis. We are planning to have a nice trip in the HongKong!
