Demonstration of Genetic Softcoding
AND gate
Bistable switch
Violacein synthetic pathway
During the first wave of synthetic biology,  many functional genetic devices were constructed based on engineering  principles, including logic gates, switches, oscillators and sensors. However,  most cases do not exhaust the understanding accumulated by previous biological  research. Previous design and construction of genetic devices mostly rely on  concepts borrowed from electronic engineering,  rather than design principles or methods developed specially for synthetic  biology itself.
The topology of devices leads to parameter sensitivity, thus  screening for well performing devices requires laborious, time-consuming  refinement cycles. Additionally, lack of well-characterized parts and devices,  complicated but not-so reliable models, and  fluctuation caused by intrinsic noise of biological system also contribute to  the limitation. Similar problems exist in the field of metabolic  engineering. When constructing more  complex genetic program to  perform more complicated  functions, such obstacles become  more obvious and need to be solved urgently.
This  year our team developed a platform for soft-coding of genetic  circuits aiming at making screening fast, affordable and more predictable. The  platform is composed of genetic rheostat and an RBS  calculator as illustrated previously in our project. To demonstrate the  versatility and validity of the platform, we utilized the  platform to improve performance of two modular genetic devices, AND gate and bistable switch .
Figure 1. AND gate performance regulated by  different concentration of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). The on/off ratio of AND gate  increases with ligand  concentration, while the single induction of arabinose  is diminished, resulting in an AND gate with improved performance.
Figure 2. Fluorescence images of E.coli DH5α strain  populations with different plasmids from bistable switch mutant library. Each  plasmid contains different ribosome binding sites (RBSs) which control the  expression of cI434 gene, demonstrating  that the ratiometric of green cells to red cells is correlated with translation  strength.
We further applied this platform to  optimize a segment of violacein  biosynthetic pathway , and achieved producing purer desired  products.
 
Figure 3. E. coli producing pigments. When induced by  arabinose, the engineered E. coli produced dark-green pigments. Upon addition of different concentration of thiamine  pyrophosphate (TPP), the color of the bacteria gradually shifted from  dark-green to dark-brown.
