  Through fine-tuning the tranlation of core genes using the genetic rheostat, we can easily  modulate the behavior of genetic devices and complex gene circuits with ligands at various concentrations and finally configure an automated-designed RBS to meet the corresponding translation strength, thus optimal performance of gene circuits.</P><P class="mainbody">To  achieve such a goal, we employed two sets of tools to rationalize the process  of genetic devices/gene circuit modulation–genetic rheostats(ligand-responsive RNA elements) to quantitatively modulate translation process, and the RBS Calculator to predict the rate of translation initiation and automatically design a synthetic RBS  sequence that meets the needed relative translation rate determined by the genetic rheostat. A critical  step, therefore, is to map the translation strength of a particular sequence to  that of a genetic rheostat-modulated messenger RNA (mRNA). Since the genetic rheostat tunes translation by decreasing or increasing the probability of RBS exposure, which is proportional to translation strength, we can achieve the mapping process merely by determining the translation strength of the fully exposed RBS.</P><P class="mainbody">Conventionally, trl. str. was calibrated with a library of RBS mutants. But this approach is not truly reliable, because the strength of RBS strongly depends on the surrounding sequence, for instance the coding sequence, as is shown in Figure 2. Salis and Voigt have derived a model for RBS str. prediction that takes sequence context into consideration.</P><P class="mainbody">According to the model, the bridging factor between the strength of translation and a particular RBS sequence is Gibbs free energy change for translation initiation determined by RBS Calculator.A schematic representation of our modeling for the  platform is shown in the diagram below.</P><P> </P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P class="picturemark">Figure 1 Schematic  representation of genetic soft-coding approach and the role of RBS calculator.In  a two-step strategy (green boxes connected by curved arrows) to engineer  biological systems, a ligand-responsive RNA controller(&quot;genetic rheostat&quot;) is used to easily  determine an appropriate translation strength from varying concentrations of  the ligand, followed by replacement of the genetic rheostat(together with its  native RBS) with a fixed synthetic RBS that meets the previously determined  translation strength. The role of the RBS Calculator, therefore, is to map a value  of translation strength (expressed in terms of △G) to a specific RBS sequence.</P></TD><TD> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><STRONG>Overview of  Components of the Prokaryotic Ribosome</STRONG></P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P align="center" class="picturemark">Figure 3  Components of a prokaryotic ribosome.(Alberts et al., 2008).</P></TD><TD> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="mainbody">It  can be seen from Figure 3 that ribosome in prokaryotes consists of two subunits,  one larger with a Svedberg sedimentation coefficient of 50, and a smaller  subunit with a Svedberg sedimentation coefficient of 301. Both  subunits consist of several proteins and several strands of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)  in different lengths. In the process of translation initiation, the 30S subunit  first binds to ribosome binding site (RBS) of the messenger RNA (mRNA), in  which the 16S rRNA of the 30S subunit has a critical role of recognizing and  binding to RBS in mRNA. After recognizing and binding to the RBS, the 30S  subunit then recognizes the start codon and recruits the transfer RNA(tRNA)that  carries a fMet residue corresponding to the start codon, followed by the 50S  large subunit. The formation of a complete ribosome-mRNA complex then “fires  off” from the start codon and starts translation.</P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P class="picturemark">Figure 4 The  postulated process of translation initiation.

The last  nine nucleotides of the 16S rRNA in the 30S subunit are given. (c) Binding of  the 30S subunit to the start codon (red ribbon) and recruitment of the first  tRNA and 50S subunit to start translation.</P></TD><TD> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="mainbody">Based  on the above assumptions, ∆Gtot is composed of five additive Gibbs  free energy terms:
∆Gtot = ∆GmRNA:rRNA  + ∆Gstart + ∆Gspacing- ∆Gstandby- ∆GmRNA
where:
∆GmRNA:rRNAis  the energy change brought by binding of the 16S rRNA tail to the specific  binding region in the 5' UTR of the mRNA.
∆Gstart  is the free energy change that results from binding of the 16S-rRNA to the  start codon(it is treated as a constant for all mRNAs with AUG as the start  codon.
∆Gspacing  is the free energy change brought by the spacing sequence between the RBS and  the start codon, determined by the sequence length using an empirical formula  derived from experimental data.
∆Gstandby  is the energy needed to expose the 16S-rRNA binding site to the 16S-rRNA. 
∆GmRNA  is the free energy change for a free mRNA sequence in solution to spontaneously  fold into a native secondary structure.
The  results in the original work agree well with that derived from another probabilistic  model constructed by Na et al. (2010)3.
For  RBS Calculator used in our platform, we optimized parameters and algorithms in  the original work by Salis et al. to produce a more general tool for predicting  the translation rate of mRNAs that encode different proteins. The program  showed fair performance with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that we used,  but not as satisfactory as it did with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and its  fusion proteins in the original work. Therefore, we attempted to optimize the  program for equal performance on different protein-coding mRNAs. Since the free  energy terms to a great extent depend on a set of thermodynamic parameters used  for secondary structure prediction3, the thermodynamic scoring  matrix for base pairing in RNA was changed from rna1999 parameters used in the  original program to rna1995. Besides, as the sequence surrounding the start  codon has been shown to significantly affect the accuracy of prediction1,the  cutoff value, which is the number of nucleotides up- and downstream of the  start codon used for calculating free energy terms, was increased from 35 to  51, which produced a better fit with experimental measurements (see results  below).</P><P class="mainbody">In  order to evaluate the accuracy of the model, we exploited green fluorescent protein  (GFP) as a reporter gene to measure relative translation initiation rates of a library  of mRNAs with synthetic RBSs. The output fluorescence measured by flow  cytometry and/or spectrophotometry was fitted to the corresponding prediction  by RBS Calculator software package that integrates the separate calculations of  the five energy terms described above into ∆Gtot and provides an arbitrary expression level using  equation (1) and fitted parameters for the scaling coefficient <EM>K</EM> (~2500) and β(~0.45).Results for GFP before  and after changing the parameters are shown in Fig 5a and Fig 5b respectively.  It can be seen that altering the parameters used in the algorithm significantly  improved the fitting results.</P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"><P valign="top">(a)</P><P valign="top">(b)</P></TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P align="left" class="picturemark">Figure  5 Fitness of experimental measurements to computational predictions by RBS  Calculator.
