Information & Material Sharing with other teams
Peking University is among the earliest ones to establish iGEM team in China, and we would like to share our experience and experiment materials with other teams. OUC-China iGEM team and Tsinghua_A iGEM team participate in this competition for the first time this year. We 3 teams have some online discussions, and a lot of information about iGEM 2011 competition and team organization affairs has been shared with these 2 new teams.
Besides,  we are very glad to have discussions with Yifan Yang at Peking University on  May 23rd, 2011. Yifan Yang was a member of 2007 iGEM Peking University  team and is currently an advisor of 2011 iGEM Paris_Bettencourt team. Ideas of  the two teams had been discussed and Yang also shared his current work on cell  aging.

Professor  Miha Mraz's visiting in Peking University
Professor Miha Mraz, one of the instructors  of 2010 iGEM Slovenia team from University of Ljubljana, visited Peking  University on June 17th, 2011. At the Center for Theoretical  Biology, he gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of  Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and  bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz's visit has surely  promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University  team.
 
iGEM CHINA Meetup 2011 Held in Hefei
Four team members of Peking_R team, along with the instructor Haoqian Zhang, attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on July 30th-31st, 2011.        The Meetup invited several professors and graduate students to give us talks on current status, challenges and prospects of synthetic biology. Besides, each team gave a brief introduction to its project, and all the attendants participated into discussions and giving suggestions. Our instructor, Haoqian Zhang, gave a talk on forward and reverse engineering approaches in synthetic biology. Shuobing Chen, our team leader, gave a brief talk on our project, "softcoding design in synthetic biology".        After this two-day Meetup, we have learned a lot from other iGEM teams from China, and we hope we can have more discussions with them in the following summer!
 
 
the Online Video talk with Dr. Hoo from the University of Edinburgh
Dr. Linda Hoo from the University of Edinburgh interviewed Peking_R team on Aug. 10th. During this online video talk, Dr. Hu asked a few questions to each of our team members relating to the construction, operation and division of work of our team. We hope this talk could help  promote the communication between Peking_R team and Edinburgh team!
