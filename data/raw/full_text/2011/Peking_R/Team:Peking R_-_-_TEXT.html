In our project, we are aiming  at establishing an extensible and versatile methodology for the softcoding of  genetic program in bacteria, composed of genetic rheostat and RBS calculator. The  genetic rheostats are truly modular ligand-responsive  riboswitches, while the RBS calculator is software for both translation of ligand concentration into quantified translation strength and automated design of synthetic  ribosome binding sites (RBS) with customized strength.

Peking_R team consists of 11 undergraduate students who are enjoying synthetic biology.

We've submitted basic reliable genetic rheostats. Besides, we applied them to construct various functional devices. Click here to learn more.
Our human practice concerns on how the  development of synthetic biology affects public health and the process of horizontal gene transfer among prokaryotes. To learn more, please click here .
Here we describe measures taken to guarentee biosafety in our project, answering frequently asked questions  concerning about environment and public health. To get more information, please click here .
It is an unforgettable summer  when we fought for our dream and the honor of Peking iGEM team.
