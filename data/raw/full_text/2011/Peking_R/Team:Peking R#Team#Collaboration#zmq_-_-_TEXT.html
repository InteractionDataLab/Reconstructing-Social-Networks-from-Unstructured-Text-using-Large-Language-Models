IGEM CHINA 2011 Held in Hefei
Four team members of Peking_R team, along with the instructor Haoqian Zhang, attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) on July 30th-31st, 2011.        The Meetup invited several professors and graduate students to give us talks on current status, challenges and prospects of synthetic biology. Besides, each team gave a brief introduction to its project, and all the attendants participated into discussions and giving suggestions. Our instructor, Haoqian Zhang, gave a talk on forward and reverse engineering approaches in synthetic biology. Shuobing Chen, our team leader, gave a brief talk on our project, softcoding design in synthetic biology.        After this two-day Meetup, we have learned a lot from other iGEM teams from China, and we hope we can have more discussions with them in the following summer!
