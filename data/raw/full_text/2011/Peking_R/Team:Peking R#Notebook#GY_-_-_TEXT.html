Gong Yan's Notebook
 
 
I took part in the task of the construction of the RNA controllers and the application of them in bistable switch. I am also the lab manager of the lab.

Contents:
28th June — 1st July
Sequence the plasmid of bistable  switch from LOU Chunbo and make clear of the conditions of it.
Change the backbone of  bistable switch to pSB1C3 named BS1C3.
2nd July — 8th July
Count the green colonies  in which E. coli expressing GFP on LB plate as well as the red colonies in  which E. coli expressing mRFP to observe original bistable switch after transformation  by using fluorescence microscope.
Analyze the expression of GFP  and mRFP in bistable switch on normal condition by using flow cytometry.
9th  July — 21th July
Construct the library of the bistable switch changing the RBS  of cI434 gene.
Count the green colonies and the red colonies of each one of  the bistable switch library, observing that BS1C3-68(the 68th of the  bistable switch library) is nearly 1:1 in the ratio of red colonies to green colonies  and BS1C3-42 is nearly 3:1 in the ratio of red colonies to green colonies.
22th July — 18th Aug
Reconstruct  the pBAD_TPP ribozyme_GFP_terminator parts with ZHAO Yangyang：
19th Aug — 30th  Aug
Construct pBAD_TPP  ribozyme_mcherry_terminator parts with ZHAO Yangyang.
Mutate the first 36bp of GFP  sequence of the given plasmid from J_rg S. Hartig into the first 36bp of GFP  part in E0040 with ZHAO Yangyang.
31st  Aug — 28th  Sep
Apply the RNA controllers  to the bistable switch, mainly utilizing TPP2.5 or TPP1.20 to control the  expression of cI434 respectively and Theo1G1 or TheoN8-3 to control the  expression of cI in bistale switch with Yan Xiaowei and Chen Shuobin. These  works include the constructions of particular colonies and investigating the  influences of the ligand concentration to the ratio of green colonies to red  colonies by up-regulating or down-regulating the  expression of the genes.
Prepare for the parts  submission with MU Tong.
29th  Aug — 4th  Oct
