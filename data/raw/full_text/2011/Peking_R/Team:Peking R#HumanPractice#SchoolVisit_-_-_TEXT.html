As ignorance and carelessness are two of the important reasons lead to the spread of ARB, we believe that informing the public what we face and what we should do is indispensable if we want to battle against the public health hazards caused by ARB. School visit is part of our project that could directly inform the high school students about ARB, some of whom may end up doing biological research a few years later.
We visited Yaohua High School and gave a presentation on the ARB and iGEM. We introduced the conception of ARB and showed some slices about its origin, its harm and what we can do to control it. Then we presented iGEM and our project to them. We also answered some questions asked by the curious high school students.     See photos here!
