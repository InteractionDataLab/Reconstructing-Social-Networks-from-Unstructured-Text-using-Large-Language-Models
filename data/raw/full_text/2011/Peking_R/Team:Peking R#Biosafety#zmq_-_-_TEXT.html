VISITORS FROM......
1. Would any of  your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher  safety,  public safety,  or  environmental  safety?
As our project  aims at establishing a facile platform for soft-coding of genetic program in  bacteria, it may bring about certain safety issues regarding researcher and environmental safety. Therefore, we have carefully  revised experiment guidelines and safety rules to minimize possible hazards to researchers safety and environmental safety,  placing extra stress on properly handling bacteria, plasmids and  nucleotide-related reagents to prevent undesirable spread of genes into the  environment. All researchers are required to clean up their working area and  make sure no pollutants are left unattended. Besides, since we are not  conducting large-scale proliferation of microorga
nisms, and Protocols for preservation and operation of common E.coli strains are  strictly adhered to, the possibility of threatening public safety is  further reduced.
2. Do any of the  new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety  issues?
If yes,      did you document  these issues in the Registry?      How did you  manage to handle the safety issue?      How could other  teams learn from your experience?
Since we primarily  focus on evolving existing non-biohazard parts, mainly RNA device for translation  regulation, none of the new BioBrick parts we made this year would raise any  safety issue according to our current profession context.
 
3. Is there a  local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what  does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which  specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
Yes. Both our institution and the state government have committees  that establish guidelines and policies on biosafety. Evaluation of biosafety in research laboratories are regularly  carried out, including evaluation of research proposals that may determine whether grants are given, as well as monitoring of experimental procedures in the laboratories to ensure that they meet the standards of biosafety.
To learn more about PR China’s administrations and  regulations concerning biosafety. please click the following links:
National Biosafety Office ,  Ministry of Environmental Protection, PR China
This website lists policies, regulations and  contracts on ensuring safe research in biology and publishes latest domestic  and international news on bio
safety.
Biosafety regulation on  pathogenic microbes , PR China
This webpage  declares rules and policies established by the State Department that regulates  laboratory management regarding pathogenic microbes, including classification  of pathogenic microbes, respective treatments and control of laboratory infection.
 
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal  with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could  parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Enhancement of  biosafety in the iGEM competitions requires the collaboration of every team as  well as the iGEM committee. Since BioBrick provides standard synthetic biology  parts, it would be relatively easier to establish  safety standards for handling these parts. Special lectures on how measures could also be taken to minimize  safety issues raised by experiments in synthetic biology may be given during  the iGEM workshops.
As for  laboratory research, besides a reference sequence databank that may be referred  to for possibly hazardous genes, self-destruction  functions of plasmids in response to undesirable hosts are also  recommendable for BioBrick parts. Orthogonality  in the design and construction of functional genetic devices may also be  encouraged in the competition in order to reduce the probability of horizontal  gene transfer that may endow wild-type species with overly high advantages in  intraspecies competition or even underestimated virulence.
