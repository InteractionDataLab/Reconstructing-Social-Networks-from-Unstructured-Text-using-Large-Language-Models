Once found, antibiotics were considered as the solution to most  infectious diseases and saved billions of people’s lives.  Unfortunately, the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, combined with the widely use of  antibiotic resistance genes as markers, lead to a worldwide public health  problem——Antibiotic  resistance. It is easier than ever before  to find antibiotic resistance  bacteria around us. We continue to read news stories about  superbugs, bacteria that are increasingly resistant to common antibiotics currently. They not only cause crossbred bacteria pollution, but also  lead to infectious diseases outbreak, like what happened in Europe some months  before this year. Every  year, E. U. reports 25,000 deaths due to bacterial infection that are  outsmarting even the newly invented antibiotics [1]. Many people believe that the abuse of  antibiotic causes the spread of antibiotic resistance bacterium; however, some  researchers believe that the lab work also takes an important role in this  process. Our human practice focuses on the treatment of useless or excrescent  antibiotic resistance bacterium and possible solution of the spread of  antibiotic resistance bacterium.
Using antibiotics in inappropriate  ways and abusing them is a majored and old cause of antibiotic resistance.  Most people used to rely on antibiotics every time they have  an infection, though sometimes they get viral infections or they can recover  soon without antibiotics. What’s worse, in many countries, it is easily to get  antibiotics without a prescription. There are always people who don’t follow  the dose and schedule instructions exactly. Using antibiotics when you don’t  need them or using them in a wrong way is a significant contributor to  antibiotic resistance.
Antibiotic are not only used to  treat infection of bacterium, but also used in agriculture, and the agricultural use also poses a significant problem. Both domestic and  farm animals are treated with antibiotics, not only to cure infections, but  also to promote faster growth and prevent disease in healthy ones. In fact,  though there is little information and statistics on the quantity and range of  antibiotics used in agricultural, people believe that the majority of  antibiotics produced are used in this industry. As agriculture is relatively  far from our lives, it is easy to ignore these widely available antibiotics and  their side effects. Antibiotic resistance in and around factory farms is  particularly rapid and vigorous, leading from the difficult to find the suitable  doses of antibiotics for animals.
Antibiotic resistance gene, which resides on plasmids to facilitate the selection of copies  carry along this plasmid, is the most common  marker used in synthesis biology and other genetic engineering. Most, if not all,  plasmids, including iGEM parts, carry one or more antibiotic resistance genes. Though these genes can be transferred between bacteria in a horizontal  fashion and should be treated carefully, the widely using of them low  researchers attention on them.
Beside this, one of the goals of synthesis biology is to make  design of biological system easy enough so that people without a traditional  education in biology be able to take part in this design. Many efforts have  been made to develop a toolbox which is easy to use for people without professional  background. On the one hand, the extensive use of such toolbox attracts  researchers from non-biological disciplines such as engineering or computer  scientists and makes this field more interesting; on the other hand, the  participation of people lack formal biosafety training will automatically raise  the risk of biosecuriety. This risk includes many aspects:
1, there is a good  chance that one day ordinary people would have the ability to create novel organisms  which may be harmful to the environment or people;
2, people without appropriate  training may treat the synthesis biological parts in a wrong way.
In fact, even professional biological researchers are likely to ignore safety principles  (details in 3.2). As more and more parts have been created and used,  researchers are too familiar with antibiotic resistance bacterium to treat them  serious. The common treatments like pouring into sewer or throwing into the  garbage can, with or without medium, cannot prevent these antibiotic resistance  genes or these bactium from affecting the environment.
