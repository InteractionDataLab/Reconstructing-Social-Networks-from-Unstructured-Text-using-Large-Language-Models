Our Songs
In our project, we are aiming  at establishing an extensible and versatile platform for the softcoding of  genetic program in bacteria, composed of a toolbox and a methodology --The  toolbox consists of interoperable and truly modular ligand-responsive  riboswitches/ribozymes, while the methodology is automated design of synthetic  ribosome binding sites (RBS) with customized translation rate. When combining  them together, a quantitative correlation between the concentration of specific  ligand and synthetic RBS strength can be established. To learn more, please click here.
 
 
Peking_R team for iGEM 2011 consists of 11  undergraduate students who are enthusiastic towards synthetic biology.
To know  more about us and our work, please visit our Team page and our Notebook.
 
We are planning to submit a set of riboswitches/ribozymes which can response to different ligands. Besides, we are  going to hand in parts containing vio operon which are optimized to produce  more violacein in bacteria.Click here to learn more.
 
This part shows our human practice project concernning on how the  development synthetic biology affects the process of horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and influences public health. To learn more, please click here
 
This part describes measures taken to ensure biosafety in our project, answering frequently asked questions  concerning environment and public health. To get more information, please click here .
 
It's an unforgettable summer  we fight for our dreams and the honour of Peking iGEM team.
