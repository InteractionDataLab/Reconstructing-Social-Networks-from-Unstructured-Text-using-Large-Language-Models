MU Tong’s  Notebook
7.1~7.7
Preparation of biobrick parts that  would be used in our project from the 2011 distribution, including  transformation and mini-prep, followed by restriction digestion with certain  enzymes according to the standard assembly assay.
Designing and synthesizing the primers  and a regulatory element.
7.8
Experimental trouble shooting: testing  and optimizing the protocols of double digestion, PCR and ligation.
7.9~7.11
Constructing the theophylline  hammerhead regulatory system, including constructing hammerhead element with OE  PCR, double digestion and ligation following the standard assembly assays.
Sequence correct. J
7.12~7.17
Constructing the RBS strength  characterization system with random primers using PCR. Optimizing the protocol  and preliminary characterization of the RBS strength.
However, the results suggest that the  system is polluted by template.
Designing new primers.
7.18~7.25
Constructing the RBS characterization  system by another approach.
Sequence correct.
Preliminary characterization of the  system.
7.26~8.5
Assembly of the Theophylline responsive  hammerhead ribozyme (theo HH) with the Cd Intron utilizing two approaches,  Standard Assembly and Gibson Assembly. Further attaching this regulatory  element to a GFP reporter (pBAD+RBS+GFP+Terminator) to demonstrate the  responsive action to theophyline.
8.6~8.14
Constructing the Parental T4td Intron and  assembling it into the GFP reporter. Fusing the parental intron with a theophylline  responsive aptamer.
Altering the recognization specificity  by changing the theophylline aptamer into a Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP)  responsive hammerhead ribozyme (TPP HH).
Both elements show limited responsive  to the ligands.
 
8.30~9.7
Designing and synthesizing the primers  of AND gates.
Constructing the AND gates with  theophylline riboswitches residing downstream the pSal promoter.
9.8~9.20
Testing and optimizing the protocols of  characterizing the ligand responsive AND gates.
Preliminary characterization of the AND  gates.
Characterization of specific AND gates  that performed obvious ligand responsive actions in the preliminary  characterization. Collecting the data for modeling.
9.21~9.28
Preparing for the part submission:  collecting well characterized and standardized parts from team members,  documenting parts in the Part Registry, submitting the parts.
Further characterization of the AND  gates.
9.29~10.4
Collecting experimental data and  protocols.
Writing manuscript for wiki.
