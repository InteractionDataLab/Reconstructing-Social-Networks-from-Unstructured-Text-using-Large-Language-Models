Zhang Zhenrun's Notebook
 
 
I participate in designing the project and detailing the experiments. Particularly I'm in charge of constructing vio operon parts containing ribozymes so that we can enhance the product purity of the metabolic pathway.

Contents:
07.21-07.28 
Construted Terminator-pBAD promoter for  part assembly in the next step.
07.29-08.05 
Attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup and had a  few days’ holiday.
08.06-08.13 
Characterize deoxyviolacein primarily by  TLC (developed by dichloromethane: methanol = 6:1 (v/v)) and spectrophotometry  (absorbance wavelength=570nm).
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioABD.
08.14-08.18
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioC  with scores of base pair from vioB at 5’ and scores of base pair from vioE,  termed “vioCC”. Sequencing results showed that it is actually  Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioD with scores of base pair from vioB at 5’ and scores  of base pair from vioE, termed “vioDD”.
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioE.
08.19-08.25
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP  ribozyme 1.20-vioE & Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP ribozyme 2.5-vioE, both of  whose ribosomal binding sites were mutated to AGGAGGT.
08.26-08.31
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioABDE.
09.01-09.08
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP  ribozyme 2.5-vioE, whose ribosomal binding site is native.
09.09-09.15
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP  ribozyme 1.20-vioD.
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioABD-  Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP ribozyme 2.5-vioE, in the backbone of  pSB3K3.
09.16-09.23
Acquired HPLC results of the extraction  from E. coli producing proviolacein and deoxychromoviridans.
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP  ribozyme 1.20-vioD-Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP ribozyme 2.5-vioE & Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP ribozyme 1.20-vioD -Terminator(B0015) -pBAD-vioE.
09.24-10.04
Constructed Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioAB- Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-  TPP ribozyme 1.20-vioD- Terminator(B0015) -pBAD-vioE.
Switched the backbone of  Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-vioABD- Terminator(B0015)-pBAD-TPP ribozyme 2.5-vioE to  pSB1C3.
Part submission.
Wiki editing, part documentation.
