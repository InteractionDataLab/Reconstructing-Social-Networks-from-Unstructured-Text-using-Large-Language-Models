    The relatively simple and repetitive  composition of RNA molecules makes them easy to synthesize and manipulate.  Evidence shows that RNA also has the structural sophistication needed for  dynamic interplay between functionally distinct catalytic and receptor  domains<A href="#r1">[1]</A>. In our project, we tried to utilize these small genetic rheostats to  tune translation rate of target gene quantitatively. </P><P class="mainbody">Numerous riboswitches and hammerhead  ribozymes have been depicted previously <A href="#r2">[2,3]</A>. However, they all function via  hiding or exposing the ribosomal binding site (RBS, which is a major determinant  of translation rate) through different mechanisms (Figure 1a and 1b) <A href="#r3">[3,4]</A>. This  will probably lead to a relatively high basal level because of the conservation  of intact RBS. We speculated that, with the self-splicing Group I intron  ribozymes that will be further described later, we could interrupt the RBS  sequence via inserting a ribozyme to remove the basal level of translation rate  and manipulate translation rate via modulating fraction of ligand-induced  self-splicing (Figure 1c). </P><P> </P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure 1.

Before those, we  will first make a brief introduction about group I intron ribozyme.</P><P class="mainbody"><STRONG>Group I intron ribozymes</STRONG>
    Group I intron ribozymes consist of two  parts----an aptamer which directly senses the small effector molecule and an  intron which self-splices in response to the conformational change transmitted  from the aptamer.</P><P class="mainbody">An aptamer is a piece of nucleic acid or  peptide that binds to specific ligand. Here, we refer to RNA aptamers. Various  kinds of aptamers have been discovered, among which is the one responses to 3'-5'-cyclic  diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP). C-di-GMP is a second messenger signaling molecule  that regulates many vital processes within the bacterial kingdom including  motility, pathogenesis and biofilm formation<A href="#r5"> [6,7]</A>. Its corresponding aptamers  can be categorized into two classes and the binding mechanism of class I is  illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3<A href="#r6"> [7]</A>. </P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure  2. </STRONG>Comparison of the consensus sequences and  structural models for class I (left) and class II (right) c-di-GMP aptamers.

Introns are classified into four  groups based on splicing mechanisms. Group I and group II introns are able to  self-splice using different mechanisms <A href="#r7">[8]</A>. However, assistance from proteins  is required for in vivo splicing for Group II intron. All Group I introns share  a conserved secondary structure consists of nine paired regions (P1-P9 shown in  Figure 4) <A href="#r9">[9]</A>. Splicing of Group I introns is processed by two sequential  ester-transfer reactions. The exogenous guanosine or guanosine nucleotide first  docks onto the active G-binding site located in P7, and its 3'-OH is aligned to  attack the phosphodiester bond at the 5' splice site located in P1, resulting  in a free 3'-OH group at the upstream exon and the exoG being attached to the 5'  end of the intron. Then the terminal G (ΩG) of the intron swaps the exoG and occupies the G-binding site to  organize the second ester-transfer reaction, the 3'-OH group of the upstream  exon in P1 is aligned to attacks the 3' splice site in P10, leading to the  ligation of the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and free of the catalytic  intron <A href="#r10">[10]</A> (Figure 5). </P><TABLE width="200" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD> </TD><TD><P class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure  4.</STRONG><STRONG>Overall  secondary and tertiary structure of the Azoarcus pre-2S intron splicing  complex.

    Genetic rheostats are promising gene  regulatory elements for efficient operation of cellular processes due to their  modularity and pre-translational fast-response. More and more RNA regulatory  elements have been studied and an easier approach to combine them and cluster  their properties is need urgently. Breaker and his co-workers have previously  demonstrated that the cleavage activity of hammerhead ribozyme can be coupled  with the binding of molecular effectors to corresponding aptamer by simple  expedient of appending aptamers to non-essential stem regions<A href="#r12"> [3,11,12].</A> However, in addition to hammerhead ribozyme, there are still lots of available  RNA regulatory elements with complicated structures that are difficult to  engineer <A href="#r11">[13]</A>.</P><P class="mainbody">Here, we proposed a design in which the  activity of other complicated ribozyme, including group I intron, can be easily  modulated, combining with engineered hammerhead aptazymes. Hammerhead ribozyme  here was used as an “Adapter” to link the binding of effector molecules to  specific aptamer to the self-splicing activity of group I intron as Figure 8  and Figure 9 shows previously in this project. Under this design, we can easily  swap the hammerhead aptazyme, the adapter, to construct engineered group I  introns that self-splice in response to different effector molecules, without  further <EM>in vitro</EM> selection which is  time consuming and labor resume. In summary, this design is fast, affordable  and more predictable with general interest.</P><P class="mainbody"> </P><P align="center" class="TITLE21"> </P><P class="mainbody"><SPAN class="Reference">Reference:</SPAN></P><OL><LI>Ronald R Breaker.
