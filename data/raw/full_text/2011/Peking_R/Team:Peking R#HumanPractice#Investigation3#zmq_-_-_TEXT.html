In the final part of our survey, we  try to look at the attitudes towards possible approaches to ensure biosafety  related to ARB. Most respondents chose to employ proper procedures for  processing used microbes in the laboratory rather than use special plasmids  that minimize HGT(Q12). This is in fact a more rational choice as adopting  special plasmids may lower researchers’ awareness of HGT and give rise to new  threats. As to whether the government should implement new policies to regulate  the processing of used ARB, most agreed, but some showed opposition(Q13)  contending that it might be troublesome in determining the details and that  still it would be difficult to make the policies work: the government is  unlikely supervise the treatment of RAB every minute. Besides, we also wander  whether the government will run the risk of impeding research progress by heavily  punishing laboratories for violating these policies.
Question 12
Question 13
In conclusion, we would like to say  that the regulation of antibiotics and ARB use is a matter much more complex  than previously estimated. First of all, it is hard to accurately predict what  exactly happens after HGT takes place, i.e., whether HGT confers the environment with genes that are useful or harmful to humans. Second, the  establishment of regulations on ARB use and waste processing in different  countries and regions will certainly encounter obstacles due to several  concerns including financial support. Third, even if detailed and strict  procedures are established, laboratories may not be able to discipline  themselves and adhere to the standards. As we have seen above, the problem lies  not in the understanding, but rather in the attitudes and determination to  fight against the abuse and careless treatment of ARB. Besides, as current  trends imply that an increasing number of participants without professional  backgrounds in biology are involved in synthetic biology research, more  challenges are posed to the insurance of biosafety. Professional researchers  themselves may not strictly adhere to laboratory rules and restrictions, let  alone non-professional participants.
However, nothing  should become a reason for us not to battle against the public health hazards  caused by ARB. We cannot afford to wait for greater outbreaks of superbugs or  antibiotic-resistant pathogen infections before we build up our defense. We  strongly suggest that special agencies or departments funded by the government  be set up to collect and process used ARB in the laboratory. Laboratories  should make it a rule to separate all used microbes and materials that have  been in direct contact with bacteria or their DNA/RNA from other waste and hand  them over to the ARB processing agency. They may also process waste by  themselves, but must ensure that all of them are sterilized or treated with  strong digestive solutions to break up the antibiotic resistance genes.
