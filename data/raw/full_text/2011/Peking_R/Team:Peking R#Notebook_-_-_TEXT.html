Chen Shuobing
I am the  leader of iGEM 2011 Peking_R team. I take part in designing project and the modeling module.
 
 
Luo Zheng
I took responsibility of management of Peking University iGEM society, and participated in the construction of Ribocontrolled AND GATE.
 
 
Gong Yan
I took part in the task of the construction of the RNA controllers and the application of them in bistable switch. I am also the lab manager of the lab.
 
 
Xiao Qingyang
I am responsible for the selection of a useful adenine sensing hammerhead ribozyme, which will be used in the regulation of our pathway. I am also responsible for the human practice project.
 
 
Zhang Zhenrun
I participate in designing the project and detailing the experiments. Particularly I'm in charge of constructing vio operon parts containing ribozymes so that we can enhance the product purity of the metabolic pathway.
 
 
Liu Yunpeng
I took part in the task of constructing the platform for translation initiation rate prediction, and modeling the AND gate and bistable switch modules.
 
 
Hao Siyang
I am responsible for establishing RNA controllers which recognize theophylline as a desired ligand. Further more, I test and optimize various kinds of RNA controllers' responses in regulating gene expression.
 
 
Zhao Yangyang
My work mainly focuses on the construction and part of characterization of several TPP ribozyme parts.
 
 
Mu Tong
I participated in designing of the project and constructing the characterization system, focusing on the regulatory elements utilized in the project.
 
 
Yan Xiaowei
I am in charge of the construction of c-di-GMP and theophylline ribozymes, focusing on the response properties of these ribozymes to corresponding ligands ---- c-di-GMP & theophylline. I am also the designer of our team's shirt.
 
 
Zhang Mengqi
I do part of the job for selection with Qingyang Xiao. And I am also the Artist for our team and responsible for the art design of our wiki, poster,and the PPT.
