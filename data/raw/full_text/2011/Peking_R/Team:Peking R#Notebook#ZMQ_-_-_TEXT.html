07.01-07.07
I practiced the skills of molecular biology  experiments such as PCR, transformation, plasmid extraction and anticipated in  the preparation for the genetic selection with my partner Xiao Qingyang.
I designed the construction of the wiki and  learned how to use some softwares, for instance, Dreamweaver, Photoshops, Flash  to do our wiki.
07.8-07.14
We selected(ON) the Top 9 in M9 culture. But  here something went wrong that the bacteria could not suvive in the M9(amp.)  culture. So we adjusted the protocols and changed the bacteria with Top 10,  which contributed to the survive of the bacteria through the progress of ON  Selection.
With the help of Zheng Luo, I was able to get  plenty of picture ingredients for our wiki. I designed our mainpage flash and  banners of every pages, and so was the two navigation bars.
07.15-07.21
We did the off-selection with NiCl2.
Luckly, I finished the pages of biosafety and  project description before the deadline. Then, I designed parts of pages within  the Team section.
07.22-07.28
We found something wrong in our culture that  we were not supposed to add glucose to our culture. So we restarted our  selection again. At the same time, I checked that the AND GATE BBa K228258 made  by Team Peking in 2009 did work.
In addition, I made our team gallery on our  wiki.
07.29-07.31
Haoqian Zhang, Shuobin Chen, Zherun Zhang,  Xiaowei Yan and I went to USTC to attend to the 2011 China Meetup held in  Hefei. We gave a presentation and made many friends there.
08.01-08.04
I got another task with YanGong and Yangyang  Zhao to add the “tpp” to the biostable backbond.
I took some work about Human Practice, we  designed a survey, printed them and do the survey. I also added this part on  our wiki.
08.05-08.12
We handed out our survey in our biology  building, collected them, gathered and analyzed Data. I also amplified the Tpp  and pBAD Biostable in PCR, cut them with restriction enzyme and link them. Then  I transformed the produce into Trans 5ɑ(one kind of  competent cells from Escherichia coli) Unfortunately,  there was no bacteria survive on the plate.
08.13-08.15
I did the same experiment I did these days in  the Lab again, and failed again.
08.30-09.05
I designed the Notebook Section on our wiki,  and improvesd several webs of our wiki.
09.06-09.15
I finished the Team Section on our wiki.
09.15-09.30
I finished the Human Practice Section, and  designed the picture for our parts. I also improved our wiki style.
10.01-10.04
I drew the pictures of our project and sent  the text on our wiki.
