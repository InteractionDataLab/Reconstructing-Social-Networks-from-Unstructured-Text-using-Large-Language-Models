Current situation
 
Recent E.coli outbreak in Europe has reminded us the fact that bacterial antibiotic resistance has been a worldwide hazard to public health. Though antibiotics have been considered as the primary solution to most infectious diseases and have saved billions of lives since their discovery, more and more bacterium become resistant against them. Scientists have to struggle to develop new kinds of antibiotics while how long these new antibiotics could keep effective remains doubtful. Besides, it is quit common to find bacteria pollution on antibiotic medium, even on multi-antibiotic medium, in microbiology lab. We must do something to improve this terrible situation.           In order to investigate the extent to which laboratories understand biosafety issues regarding antibiotic usage, we have carried out a survey involving about 150 participants, for more information, please click 'investigation'.
 
CAUSE
 
Inappropriate  use of antibiotics is a major cause of bacterial  antibiotic resistance. Medical practitioners depend heavily on antibiotics and  abuse them; the public can get access to antibiotics without prescriptions, and  does not strictly follow recommend dose at all times. Therefore the antibiotic  resistance bacteria were selected and further spreaded.
To make things worse, antibiotics are also  widely used in agriculture. Though easily ignored, agriculture costs most  antibiotics that are produced, and the antibiotic abuse usually evades appropriate  supervision.
Researchers, being too familiar with antibiotic-resistant bacteria to treat  them with caution, may also jeopardize public health even if they have  undergone professional training in biosafety. Moreover, with the development of  synthetic biology and standard toolkits, researchers without professional  backgrounds in biology may also get access to this field. This trend inevitably  increases the risk of biohazards.
 
SOLUTIONS
It is necessary to inform the public, including farmers, of the appropriate way to  use antibiotics and medical practitioners should be well trained. The government should pay attention to the distribution  and application of antibiotics. Also, it is never too troublesome for every researchers  participating in biology research to take systematic  training in biosafety.
For the purpose of informing young people  the right way to use antibiotics, we take a school visit. For more information,  please click SchoolVisit
