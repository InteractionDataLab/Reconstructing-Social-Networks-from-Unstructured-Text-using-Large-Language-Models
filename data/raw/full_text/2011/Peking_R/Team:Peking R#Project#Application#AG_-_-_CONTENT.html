Utilizing the platform introduced previously,  we aim at making tuning devices fast, affordable and more predictable. To  demonstrate the versatility and validity of the platform, it was firstly  applied to modulating a genetic AND gate. We chose the AND gate as a proof of  concept primarily for two reasons:
  (1) It presents biologically significant  functions in information processing, e.g., integration of environmental  information to generate appropriate responses in microorganisms.
  (2) Engineering and screening a synthetic  AND gate module involves laborious characterization when using conventional  methods, which would best contrast with the advantages of our platform’s  methodology.</P><P>The AND gate we utilized was designed by Anderson  and his colleagues and consequently standardly redesigned by PKU_Beijing 09  team (BBa_K228258, Fig. 1A).</P><P align="center" class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure 1</STRONG>

  B. The topology and  mechanism of AND gate. Parts showing in box constitute the core processing  module.</P><P class="mainbody">As shown in Fig. 1B, pBAD promoter serves  as input 1. It is activated by arabinose, leading to the expression of SupD, an  amber suppressor tRNA. The input 2 is pSal promoter activated by salicylate via  binding to NahR. It regulates the expression of a T7 polymerase coding sequence  with two amber codons reside in the position 8 and 14 (T7ptag), resulting in  premature translational termination. When both T7ptag and SupD tRNA genes are  expressed, functional T7 polymerase would be synthesized and consequently  active  output, T7 promoter. A green  fluorescent protein (GFP) generator regulated by T7 promoter serves as a  reporter.</P><P class="mainbody">It has been demonstrated that translation  strength of T7ptag is a major determinant of AND gate quality. Mutagenesis of  RBS leads to various performance, thus we modeled the AND gate using transfer  function, as further illustrated by phase diagrams. The phase diagram displays  the system’s output properties in response to all possible input combinations (Fig  2). In the case of AND gate, two inputs and one output are involved. Inputs are  the expression strength of pSal and pBAD induced by different concentration of  the two inducers, salicylate and arabinose, respectively, and the output is the  fluorescence intensity of reporter GFP. To construct such a phase diagram, the  input promoter strengths are measured by GFP fluorescence in response to  varying inducer concentrations. We also normalized output fluorescence intensity  values to the maximum possible fluorescence determined by model parameters.  Assuming that the output is measured at the system’s steady state, we derived  the output function using ordinary differential equations (ODEs):</P><P class="mainbody">Where <EM>F</EM> is an arbitrary, unitless measure for output fluorescence and <EM>F</EM>max is the highest possible  level of output determined by parameters in ODEs describing the process of gene  expression and regulation. <EM>I</EM>1  and <EM>I</EM>2 are the inputs in  units of fluorescence (au). <EM>a</EM> is a  parameter reciprocally proportional to the translation strength of the <EM>T7ptag</EM> coding region, and <EM>b </EM>merely results from a scaling factor  to unify units of measurement.
  (The detailed construction of each ODE  describing transcription and translation processes and integrating input values  into the output function can be found in Appendices.)</P><P class="mainbody">The phase diagrams were obtained by plotting  the output function as a color map over the 2-dimensional space with axes  corresponding to the two inputs, <EM>I</EM>1  and <EM>I</EM>2. The variables’  space is extended to cover a sufficiently large range of inputs to represent a  general AND gate module (Fig. 2(a)). In reality, the two inputs only vary  within a limited range that is a sub-region of the <EM>I</EM>1-<EM>I</EM>2  space. For any particular AND gate module, variations in the translation  strength of the <EM>T7ptag</EM> gene can be  reflected in changes in the range of the input <EM>I</EM>2, resulting in shifting of rectangular region in the  phase diagram that corresponds to the range of inputs. </P><P class="mainbody">The module in which translation strength of <EM>T7ptag</EM> gene is strong would be a poor  AND gate because within its range of inputs, the “ON” state (high output) can  be induced by addition of arabinose (<EM>I</EM>2)  alone even when <EM>I</EM>1 is low.  This is probably due to leakage of the Psal promoter, i.e., the promoter has a  relatively high basal activation level.</P><P class="mainbody">The translational strength of T7ptag is  dominantly regulated by RBS strength when the promoter strength is the same. Several  AND gates with different RBSs, i.e., different T7ptag translation strengths in this  condition, are characterized, of which experimental data fit the model  prediction well.</P><P align="center"><STRONG>Figure 2</STRONG>
  (a)The output  properties in response to all possible input combinations. AND gate performance  is influenced by translation strength of T7ptag. Color bar on the right  indicates the output strength corresponding to each color. Rectangular regions  represent the largest possible range of the two inputs in experimental  conditions (right to left): AND gate with progressively lower translation rates  (more positive △G) of <EM>T7ptag</EM> gene (white, yellow, green and pink).
  (b)Experimental  result of the AND gate behaviour in response to changes in translation rate.  Output is plotted as a function of the two inducer concentrations, [arabinose]  and [salicylate]. Its values have been normalized to the maximal fluorescence  measured, facilitating comparison with the theoretical phase diagrams. (Left)An  AND gate module with an RBS sequence which has a high translation rate(△G=-7.07kJ/mol). (Right)AND gate module with a weaker  RBS(decreased translation rate, △G=-0.49kJ/mol). It can be seen that changing  translation rate result in different AND gate performance.</P><P class="mainbody">In order to optimize the performance of AND  gate, the first step is to determine the optimal translation strength of the <EM>T7ptag</EM> gene using our genetic rheostat. By placing a ligand-responsive genetic rheostat element upstream of the  coding sequence, we obtained an AND gate modulator whose <EM>T7ptag</EM> gene translation rate varies in response to ligand  concentration (Fig. 3A). By optimizing the strength of translation, we are able  to make up for the leakage in transcription and a translation rate that endows  the AND gate with satisfactory performance (Fig 3B). </P><P align="center"> </P><P align="center" class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure 3 Optimization of AND  gate performance using RNA controller(TPP ribozyme).</STRONG>
  (a) Output  fluorescence of the AND gate device without addition of TPP ligand(corresponding  to a △G of -5.78kJ/mol). (b)Output fluorescence of the AND gate device with  addition of maximal concentration of TPP ligand(1μM，corresponding to a △G of -3.38kJ/mol). Vertical and  horizontal axes indicate logarithm of the concentrations of arabinose and  salicylate respectively. Apparently, addition of TPP ligand(which attenuates  translation strength) improved the AND gate performance by decreasing the area  of region for “ON” state. The two output color plots are mapped to their  corresponding positions in the full phase diagram in Figure 2, showing that  they display fair agreement with modeling results(white and yellow rectangular  respectively).</P><P class="mainbody">The translation rates are expressed in  terms of the parameter <EM>a</EM>, whose values can be determined  using the <EM>a</EM> value corresponding to  the original sequence without the RNA controller (<EM>a</EM> can be converted to a more direct indicator of translation  strength - △G using a  quantitative relationship derived in the Appendix). A dose(ligand  concentration) response curve used for finding the <EM>a</EM> value corresponding to a given TPP concentration is given in  Figure 4.</P><P align="center" class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure 4 Correlation of  parameter a with ligand (TPP) concentration.</STRONG>
  It is shown that <EM>a</EM> increases(i.e., translation  rate decreases) as TPP concentration increases, in agreement with the function  of TPP ribozyme(inhibiting translation via ligand-responsive cleavage). Notably,  the dose response curve displayed saturation at TPP concentrations above 0.3μM.</P><P class="mainbody">The final step is to replace genetic rheostat with an  automatically designed RBS sequence that meets the translation strength configuration  determined by our RBS calculator, thus to ‘fix’ the strength in genetic program,  producing desired performance.</P><P class="mainbody">As illustrated above, minor differences in  RBS strength may largely influence the performance of genetic program,  consistent with the fact that tuning genetic circuits requires laborious and  refinement cycles, especially in the case of complex systems. However, when  applying our platform to the modulation of the AND gate, the whole process does  not require construction of mutation library while still allowing for high-throughput  screening for an optimal translation strength. Additionally, our platform  enables its user to quantitatively analyze the correlation between system  behavior and translation strength of core genetic component, thus to predictably  manipulate the performance of genetic devices. In brief, soft-coding of genetic  program makes synthetic biology fast, affordable and more  predictable.</P><P class="mainbody">(To validate the reliability of parameter<EM> a</EM> as the single variable used in the model, we plotted experimental  measurements of the AND gate output under each input combination against  varying <EM>a </EM>values (reflecting ligand concentration), and theoretical  curves were fitted to the experimental results to test the robustness of  parameters under different input combinations.
