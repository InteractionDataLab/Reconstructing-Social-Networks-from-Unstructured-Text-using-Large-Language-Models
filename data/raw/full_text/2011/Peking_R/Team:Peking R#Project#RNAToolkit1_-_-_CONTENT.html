As you can see here, there are two possible approaches. One is regulating transcription strength using inducible promoters. However, due to the lacking of computational tools to effectively describe DNA-protein interaction, it is not ideal. The other approach is regulating translation strength with riboswitches. Because translation process mainly concerns about nucleotide base-paring and RNA unfolding it can be easily simulated and predicted. So we chose to regulate translation strength with riboswitches.</P><P class="mainbody">Riboswitches are structured non-coding RNA elements that control the translation of downstream gene. Hammerhead ribozymes are small self-cleaving RNAs, first discovered in satellite RNAs of plant viruses that catalyze a specific phosphodiester bond isomerization reaction in the course of rolling-circle replication<A href="#r101">[1]</A>. More recently a full-length hammerhead ribozyme from <EM> mansoni</EM> is being more frequently utilized for application. As shown in <STRONG>Fig.1-A</STRONG>, this hammerhead ribozyme can be truncated to a minimal, catalytically active motif consisting of (marked in colors) flanking a central core of 15 mostly invariant nucleotides (marked in frame). And the conserved central bases are essential for the hammerhead ribozyme's catalytic activity<A href="#r102">[1]</A>. <STRONG>Fig.1-B</STRONG> indicates that the secondary structure of the <EM>Schistosoma</EM> hammerhead ribozyme can be distorted into a uridine turn because of distant loop/bulge interaction which induces changes in stem II while simultaneously unwinding stem I. For the basic catalytic function of hammerhead ribozyme, the active site for self-cleaving of <EM>Schistosoma</EM> hammerhead ribozyme resides between stem III and stem I, as shown in <STRONG>Fig.1-A.</STRONG></P><P class="mainbody">It has been reported previously that mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthesis in <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> can bind derivative without the assistance from protein cofactors<A href="#r201">[2]</A>. These ligand-binding mRNAs actually possess thiamine or pyrophosphate binding domain, called aptamer, in which the binding event can bring about a conformational change which is important for genetic control. This natural thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) aptamer can bind to TPP specifically and a defined structure is stabilized. As shown in <STRONG>Fig.1-C</STRONG>, upon addition of TPP, TPP can bind loop in green. <STRONG>Fig.1-D</STRONG> shows the tertiary structure of natural TPP aptamer binding to TPP.</P><TABLE width="618" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH colspan="3" scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TH width="10" scope="col"> </TH><TH width="14" scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TH colspan="3" scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD colspan="3"><P align="left" class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure.1</STRONG><SPAN class="picturemark">The schematic structures of ribozyme and natural TPP aptamer. <STRONG>A) </STRONG>The secondary structure of <EM>Schistosoma</EM> hammerhead ribozyme.

The <EM>Schistosoma</EM> hammerhead domain in TPP ribozyme could perform self-cleavage when posed in an appropriate conformation, and upon self-cleavage the RBS would be released from pairing, thus ribosome could get access to RBS and initiate translation of the downstream gene. Though similar in secondary structure, TPP ribozyme 1.20 and 2.5 undergo different mechanisms to regulate the translation of downstream gene. Upon addition of TPP, the aptamer domain would bind to TPP; while TPP ribozyme 1.20 would change to a conformation that is suitable for hammerhead domain to cleave itself, TPP ribozyme 2.5 would undergo a conformational change that would decelerate the self-cleaving rate of hammerhead domain. Therefore, upon adding TPP, TPP ribozyme 1.20 would facilitate the translation of downstream gene, whereas TPP ribozyme 2.5 would decrease the translation strength of downstream gene.</P><TABLE width="600" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TH width="4" rowspan="3" scope="col"> </TH><TH width="501" scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TH scope="col"> </TH></TR><TR><TD colspan="3"><P align="left" class="picturemark"><STRONG>Figure.3</STRONG>
