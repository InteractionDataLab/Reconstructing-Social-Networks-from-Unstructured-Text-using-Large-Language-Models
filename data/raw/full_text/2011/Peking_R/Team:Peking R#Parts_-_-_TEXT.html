Parts of iGEM 2011 Peking_R
Favorite Parts
1. BBa_K598000
TPP  Down-regulated Hammerhead Ribozyme 2.5 with Native RBS+E0040+B0015
This part is TPP up-regulated hammerhead ribozyme, consisting of 131 nucleotides.
 
2. BBa_K598001
Theophylline  Responsive Riboswitch 1G1 with Engineered RBS+GFP generator
This is a GFP generator regulated by theophylline responsive riboswitch. mRNA with a theophylline riboswitch in it responds to theophylline concerntration, producing different fluorescence strength of GFP. Regulated by different promoters, it would be used to demonstrate theophylline responsive curve, providing data for modeling.
 
3. BBa_K598002
Bistable  Switch Mutant 68
This part is one of the mutation libraries of bistable switch modifying the ribosome binding site (RBS) of cI434 gene.
