Contents:
6.24-6.28
Training the experiment of cloning skill.
6.29-7.5
Test the instrument, such as the flow  cytometers, ELISA Reader, fluorescence microscope.
Test the M63 and M9 minimal medium.
7.6-7.12
Characterize the dose response curve of original  TPP hammerhead ribozyme.
Make sure the sequence of bistable switch.
7.13-7.21
Construct the TPP hammerhead ribozyme with  the promoter pBAD, but fail at last.
Get the code of the RBS calculator.
Test the performance of GFP reporter  library, and fit with the RBS calculator.
7.22-7.25
Improve the algorithm of the RBS  calculator.
7.26-7.31
Attended iGEM 2011 China Meetup and had a  few days’ holiday.
8.1-8.6
Construct the library of CI fused GFP with  different RBS sequence.
8.7-8.11
Test the performance of library of bistable  switch, and get some cloning with the appropriate ratio of green and red.
Further characterize the performance of  bistable switch using the flow cytometer.
8.12-8.15

8.16-8.23
Characterize the TPP hammerhead ribozyme  with the pBAD promoter.
Characterize the AND gate with the 1G1  theophylline riboswitch.
Characterize the engineered c-di-GMP  ribozyme.
8.24-8.31
Characterize the AND gate with different  RNA controller.
Characterize the theophylline riboswitch  and TPP hammerhead ribozyme.
9.1-9.8
Confirm the performance of the exist RNA  controller with the GFP and the CI fused GFP
9.9-9.17
Improving the coding of the RBS calculator  to fit the experiment result and make the final coding.
9.18-9.28
Characterize the AND gate and fix with the  modeling.
9.29-10.4
Characterize the bistable switch with the  TPP hammerhead ribozyme.
