Statement:
As a fast emerging interdisciplinary field,  synthetic biology has achieved quite a few seminal advancements. Though  synthetic biology has some critical problems to be tackled before it goes into  next stage of development, I believe that through efforts from all the  dedicated synthetic biologists, and with some breakthroughs in relative  disciplines, synthetic biology will become a mature scientific field while  maintaining its vigor to make exciting achievements. iGEM has offered a very  good platform for future scientists from all over the world to join in the  trend of synthetic biology.
