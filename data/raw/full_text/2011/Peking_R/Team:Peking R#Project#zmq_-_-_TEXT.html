Project Description
In synthetic biology there  are basically two approaches for genetic program fine-tuning: hardcoding and  softcoding. Hardcoding refers to coding functions and parameters in the fixed  formats and values. For example, mutagenesis at promoters or ribosomal binding  sites (RBS) generates large number of mutants, each of which, however, is fixed  with its performance. Therefore, laborious screening and assaying for object  function is needed. The opposite is softcoding, which refers to designs that  allow for the customization of performance of genetic programs via external  input, such as inducers, without having to edit the DNA sequence case by case.
In our  project, we are aiming at establishing an extensible and versatile platform for the softcoding of genetic program in bacteria, composed of a toolbox and a methodology -- The toolbox consists of interoperable and truly modular ligand-responsive  riboswitches/ribozymes, while the methodology is automated design of synthetic  ribosome binding sites (RBS) with customized translation rate. When combining  them together, a quantitative correlation between the concentration of specific  ligand and synthetic RBS strength can be established. Therefore, when tuning  genetic program, customized RBS strength at multiple sites can be high-throughputly  achieved without having to conduct laborious mutagenesis and characterization,  followed by easily determining the configuration of RBS(s) strength. Then RBS  sequences that meet this configuration will be automatically designed via computer  algorithms.
