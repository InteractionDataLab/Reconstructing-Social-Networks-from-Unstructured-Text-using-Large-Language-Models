Chen Shuobing is the leader of iGEM 2011  Peking_R team, who took part in designing project and refining the modeling  module.
Luo  Zheng took responsibility of management of Peking University iGEM society, and  participated in the construction of Ribocontrolled AND GATE.
Gong  Yan took part in the task of the construction of the RNA controllers and the  application of them in bistable switch. He is also the lab manager of the lab.
Xiao Qingyang was responsible for the  selection of a useful adenine sensing hammerhead ribozyme. She was also  responsible for the human practice project.
Zhang Zhenrun participated in designing  the project and detailing the experiments. Particularly he was in charge of  constructing vio operon parts containing ribozymes so that the purity of desired  products in the metabolic pathway could be increased.
Liu Yunpeng took part in the task of  constructing the platform for translation initiation rate prediction, and  modeling the AND gate and bistable switch modules.
Hao Siyang was responsible for  establishing RNA controllers which recognize theophylline as a desired ligand.  Furthermore, she tested and optimized various kinds of RNA controllers'  responses in regulating gene expression.
Zhao Yangyang contributed to the  construction and part of characterization of several TPP ribozyme parts.
Mu Tong participated in designing of the  project and constructing the characterization system, focusing on the regulatory  elements utilized in the project.
Yan Xiaowei was in charge of the  construction of c-di-GMP and theophylline ribozymes, focusing on the response  properties of these ribozymes to corresponding ligands ---- c-di-GMP & theophylline. She is also the designer of the team's shirt.
Zhang Mengqi did part of the experiment  for selection with Xiao Qingyang. She is also the Artist of the team and  responsible for the art design of wiki, poster, and the PPT.
We especially thank Professor Jörg Hartig for providing us the plasmid contained artificial TPP ribozymes which become our favorite parts.
We thank Professor Ronald Breaker from Yale University for providing us the plasmids in the paper “An Allosteric Self-Splicing Ribozyme Triggered by a Bacterial Second Messenger”.
We thank Professor Yohei Yokobayashi from UC Davis for providing us the plasmids in the paper “An efficient platform for genetic selection and screening of gene switches in Escherichia coli”.
We also thank the following professors from Peking University, for supporting us with equipments and reagents
Prof. Ming Tian
Prof. Qi Ouyang
Prof. Chongren Xu 
Prof. Hongwei Guo
Prof. Wensheng Wei
Prof. Xinxiang Zhang
Prof. Luhua Lai
Prof. Lei Liu
Prof. Peng Chen
And we need to thank Haoqian Zhang who both helps us designing the experiments and running the whole team.
