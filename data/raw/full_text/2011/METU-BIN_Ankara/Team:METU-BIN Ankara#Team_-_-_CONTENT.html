After learning there is a huge unknown world of Syntehic Biology, I became more curious about synthetic Biology.  This is my first year in iGEM.  When I heard igem, I directly jumped into because this is a great opportunity for me to get knowledge about Synthetic biology, meet new people and have fun at the same time :) <SPAN class="cont">In this team, as a biologist, I am the bridge in between the partsregistry and software team.  I am working on  a database which contains bilateral relations between biobricks in Partsregistry.</SPAN></P></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="sections"><SPAN class="sectext"><H4>Burcu YALDIZ</H4><P class="p">Hi, I'm Burcu. I'm a mathematician and I am taking scientific preparation courses for Graduate Program of Bioinformatics at Middle East Technical University. I like biology more than mathematics and bioinformatics give me a chance to use my mathematician skills in biology. This is my first year in iGEM. When I heard that two teams from METU got medals in iGEM 2010 I thought that “I must be in these teams” and now I'm a member of METU-BIN. I think Synthetic Biology is an extreme subject and it's an exciting experience for me being a part of this team. <SPAN class="cont">In the team I am responsible for editorial issues and organizing the sponsorship application.</SPAN></P></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="sections"><SPAN class="sectext"><H4>İsmail ASLANER</H4><P class="p">I have just graduated from Hacettepe University Electrical and Electronics Engineering department and a fresh new student at METU Bioinformatics Msc.

And this year, I will start studying the scientific preperation class in Bioinformatics Department of Middle East Technical University, as a graduate student. This is my first year in genetics science and iGEM. Although I'm a computer scientist; I always like genetics and working in the lab environment. I think iGEM is a perfect way to improve my knowledge on genetics. <SPAN class="cont">In our team, I am responsible of software development. I've coded search and scoring algorithms. And I've developed GUI with the assistance of Güngör. And i've added some extra tables to the database created by Seyedsasan. Other than software development, I've helped on finding sponsorships and talked about our project in a seminar with Gökçe, for human practice. And finally with my friends, I made an interview for live news on TV. That's all.</SPAN> :) I would like to thank my teachers, advisors and friends for their hardwork.

I'm one of the undergraduate students in the iGEM team METU-BIN and studying Biology major at Middle East Technical University (METU). So I'm learning the great science, Biology but at the same time, my deep interest in computer sciences takes me to that area as well. When I was taking some advice on Bioinformatics, which is the application of computer science and information technology to the field of biology and medicine, by Assoc. Prof. Yeşim AYDIN SON, she told me about the competition and the field synthetic biology. After a quick search on the Internet, I found this area amazing, and eventually I was one of the member of the METU-BIN. <SPAN class="cont">In the team, my contributions were to get the relational data of bioparts in PartsRegistry and store it in a standard way for computer engineers to use it. Then, I coded and designed the wiki page using HTML and CSS, and also I designed the team logo and logo of M4B. At the same time, I provided the content of wiki, with the help of my friends Burcu, Gökçe, Gökhan.</SPAN></P><P>Contact: gngrbdk [at] gmail [dot] com</P></SPAN></DIV><H3>Advisors</H3><DIV class="sections"><SPAN class="sectext"><H4>Seyedsasan HASHEMIKHABIR</H4><P class="p">My name is Sasan.
