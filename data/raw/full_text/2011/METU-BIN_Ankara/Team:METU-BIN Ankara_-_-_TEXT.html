M4B: Mining for BioBricks
It's a miner that goes over all the parts and finds the possible devices for you! See our software, it's online!
Project
Our project aims to provide a software tool to facilitate selection process of the right parts for their experiments in minimum amount of time and effort. Read more .
Collaborations
It's very important that on projects or even a little work people should collaborate always to reach the best! Thus, we consider it as a key factor to succeed. See it .
Human Practice
Science and technology are not only for students, academicians but they are also for children and people with other interests. Thus, we've been with them together. See .
Safety
Safety is always a concern in synthetic biology, computer applications and virtualizing techniques tries to reduce the threat of non-predictable events. Read more .
Team
METU-BIN team with Prof. Dr. Charles Cantor at Informatics Science Festival 2011 at METU. Meet the team .
Notebook
We want to inform you about our adventures when getting ready for the iGEM competition. Take a look .
Why do you need M4B?
Do you care safety?
