General Protocols
Infection Assay
Primers
T3SS RK13 cell Injection Assay
Seed RK13 cells
Remove the culture medium and wash 3 times with PBS follwed by trypsinization
Suspend RK13 cells with antibiotics free RPMI-10% FCS
Seed 2x105/well RK13 cells on a 6 well plate or a glass bottom 3.5 cm dish 20 hrs before infection
Prepare E. coli culture
Grow E. coli in 4 mL of LB with appropriate antibiotics at 37C overnight
10 hrs before injection
Centrifuge 4 mL of E. coli culture at 3,500 rpm for 10 min in the round tube.
Centrifuge the culture 3,500 rpm for 10 min
Discard the sup and resuspend with 4 mL of MgM-MES(pH 5.0) with appropriate antibiotics and grow for 4 hrs at 37C
4 hrs later(1 hr before injection) centrifuge the culture 3,500 rpm for 10 min, and discard the sup
Resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of antibiotics free RPMI-10% FCS+HCl(pH 5.0) and transfer the culture into micro tube
Centrifuge the culture 5,000 rpm for 2 min and discard the sup
Repeat step 6 and 7 three times
Measure and adjust the concentration of E. coli RPMI(pH 5.0) culture(ΔOD = 0.06)
And appropriate antibiotics into this E. coli culture
Injection
Remove the RPMI on RK13
Add 1 mL of E. coli RPMI(pH 5.0) culture(ΔOD = 0.06)
Incubate the plate at 37C, 5%CO2 and observe the cells by Cofocal Laser Scannning Microscope(OLYMPUS FV-1000D) under blue and green exciter light at every 1.5 hrs after first exposure.
