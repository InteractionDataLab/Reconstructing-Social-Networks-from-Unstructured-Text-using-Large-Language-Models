We tried to present both sides of discussion on GM products.

This books start by explaining bioengineering basics and is easy to understand by layman. It is hard to distinguish cross bread crops from GM crops.
And when you take pesticide into account it is hard to conclude which is safer, GM or non-GM. But we mustn't relax the control on it, owing to emergence of allergens, deterioration of ecosystem balance and so forth. We should not forge social, economic and ethical problems in which science has no say in. Most important is how we communicate correct information to the public setting.

As a matter of fact, GM crops were the outcome of capitalism. Exploring state before and after of bio technology establishment, for the purpose of the commercialization of life. Intellectual property rights were advocated to find best way to solve the agricultural market saturation, environmental problems, and high cost for drug tolerance. Based on it, partnership among entities and network of multinational corporations result in development of GM crops.

Inevitably trade friction occurs. Varying standards of labeling among U.S., EU, Australia, South America and China is also a inconvenience. In the international community, we need probe the analysis of these countries to get along well.

Nevertheless, more GM foods imported from the U.S. are in circulation in Japan. There are so many problems. For instances, vague standard of labeling, lack of preventive measure, etc. This book investigates these issues comparing Japan with EU.

This book shows the influence of GM crops from the social point of view, and points out the problem about recombinant DNA techniques.

Examples include rice which protects from pollinosis or is supplement with vitamins and blue roses. You can see the potential of GM foods if you read it.

Particularly, the writer points to inequality between scientists and citizens in terms of the depth of understanding about risks of GM crop's applications. He advocates’ for substantial information disclosure.

Some topics are too technical for layman, but this book's virtue is detailed presentation on GM crops' advantages (e.g. dietary supplement, improved yield) and disadvantages (e.g. environmental ramifications of GM crops) by experts from various fields. Themes about effects on non-GM crops and ecosystems by pollen GM crops dispersal that are covered in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 are especially detailed. This book is helpful for discussion on GM regulation code by Hokkaido government.
