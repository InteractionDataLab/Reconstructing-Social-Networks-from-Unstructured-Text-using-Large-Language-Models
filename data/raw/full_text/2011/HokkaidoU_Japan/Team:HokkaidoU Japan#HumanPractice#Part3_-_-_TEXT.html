The New Communication Tool, “BIO ART”
When we see this opportunity to think about science with citizens, BIO ART has to be simple and understandable. At the same time, “BIO ART” needs to be impressive and be able to produce it again. In order for this event to be successful, we are challenged to create a mixture of entertaining science and art, which it has been along with us from ancient days. From this conclusion, we were able to make this new kind of event besides the simple research presentation or art gallery we usually have. We were able to create this “BIO ART” gallery, thanks to our professors at Hokkaido University, who offered us photos and videos of fluorescent staining of cells and photos taken by an electron microscope. This gallery also has an opportunity to take science outside the laboratory by using art as a medium. By obtaining different materials from Hokkaido University as well as other universities, we are able to share our findings within the test tubes of the laboratory with our citizens. From this, we believe that we can get rid of the confusion that discourages people from wanting to know more about science. Through the “BIO ART” gallery, it'll be possible to appeal to citizens’ intellectual curiosity directly by showing the mysterious of genes and beautiful sceneries of scientific features. As a result, citizen will be able to see science in a new way. As well as improving: communicating with citizens. By talking with citizens about science, we can see how people feel towards science and find the ideal form of sharing science.
summary ~The merit of BIO ART~
Ideas are simple
Anyone can remake this gallery
We can enjoy from our insight
It is able to communicate with common topic (about science)
Thus, the idea itself is very simple, it’s possible to hold a gallery at a low cost, and to encourage everyone to become more interested in this new communication tool, which has a big potential in itself.
