Summary
We, the iGEM Hokkaido U team, held a science art gallery “BIO ART” at the center of Sapporo City as an event of “Human Practice” this year. This summer, we managed to exchange ideas on science with citizens and had the opportunity to think of new ways of communication between citizens and university students like us. Please take a look at our results.
