GSK tag
Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β is known to be phosphorylated by several enzymes in eukaryotic cells. We used first 13 amino acid as a tag (GSK tag) of injected fusion protein [1] . Ninth amino acid, serine, is phosphorylated in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 1). GSK tags phosphorylated state can be specifically detected by using phospho-specific antibodies. So it is effective method to distinguish GSK tag fusion protein existing in eukaryotic cells from uninjected protein remaining E. coli.
GSK tag was constructed by Julie Torruellas Garcia, Gregory V. Plano et al. We removed present Spe I site in the sequence by silent mutation.

GSK tag can be added to N terminus [1] , C terminus [1] , and anywhere in middle [2] , of the protein. We located the tag between SlrP secretion tag and the protein fused to it.
Non-phosphospecific antibodies can used for determination of total amount of expressed fusion protein within the assay.
Construction of GSK tagged T3SS-injectable proteins
Here we show a list of proteins which are to be tested for protein screening using GSK tag. We chose 8 different proteins (Table. 1). All are from iGEM 2011 biobrick distribution kit. As these parts are widely used in iGEM, characterising them would have a bigger impact compared to exotic ones.
Our main concern is not with the size but the stability of proteins against unfolding by T3SS chaperone. Previous research indicate that proteins containing Zinc-Fingers are very stable and couldn't be injected. Proteins containing such stable structure is thought to resist unfolding by T3SS chaperon.
We cloned these proteins into the Bsa I cloning site mentioned here .
We have previously shown that GFP can be injected into eucaryotic cells by observation under confocal laser microscope. Thus we have a positive control.

Table. 1 A list of several recommended proteins to be injected. Total molecular wight of each protein contains T3S signal and GSK tag domain.
However, of the time constraints we done only Pilot test which failed as a experiment for unknown causes so we don`t have a data to show.
To confirm the expression of the GSK tagged SlrP fusion proteins in E. coli  bacterial cell lysate must be analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a GSK-3β(Cell Signaling Technologies #9332 ) and a phosphospecific GSK-3β(Cell Signaling Technologies #9336) antibody preparation.
