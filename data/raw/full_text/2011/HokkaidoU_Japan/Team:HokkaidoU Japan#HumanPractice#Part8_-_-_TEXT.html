To the Future
This year’s “BIO ART” gallery was a fusion of two existent mediums: science and art. It was also thought as a new communication tool and was able to exchange thoughts between us and citizens accordance to science. But we need to be constantly active in order to achieve “a society which citizens can think by themselves”, which is our major theme. And moreover, we think that it is necessary to cooperate on this “human practice” activity together, which iGem team has been representing in various places. So, first of all, to broaden this “human practice” activity and research to a large area, we made two pages on Facebook, “iGem HokkaidoU” [1] and “Human Practice” [2] . Our purpose was to exchange knowledge about “Human Practice” among “iGEMers” (people who belongs to the iGem team) in the world. Of course, the way of sharing information such as OpenWetWare was already settled, but Facebook was better to expand due to its popularity in the world and the atmosphere in which we feel we can communicate more freely and honestly. In addition, we felt it would also be a way for citizens to recognize iGem easily. Furthermore, from the view of ways in publishing and the impact of the Internet towards the people who was discovered from the questionnaire, Facebook was the better way. Moreover, we are thinking of developing further this “BIO ART” gallery after this. This gallery was held only in Sapporo for the first time this year, but it would be better if we could do this event in various places in Japan at the same time, and eventually, develop this event to an iGEM EXPO which will be held all over the world. We will continue to work on this activity to achieve our goal in the end.
