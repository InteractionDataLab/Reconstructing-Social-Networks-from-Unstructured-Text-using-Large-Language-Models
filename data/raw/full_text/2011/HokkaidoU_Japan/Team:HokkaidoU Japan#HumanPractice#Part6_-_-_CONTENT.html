Our purpose for this event was to communicate with citizens and have them understand and enjoy science. We also made a questionnaire for citizens to fill out in order to improve our event and to know their current understanding towards science.

</P><UL><LI> Visitors: 377 people
</LI><LI> Questionnaires filled out by visitors: 101 papers
</LI><LI> Ratio of the questionnaire filled out: 27%
</LI><LI> Ratio of the visitor divided by genders and generations:
</LI></UL><P>The place we held the “BIO ART” gallery is an underground walking area “Odori” and it is used for going to school/ work due to its closeness of the subway stops. Up to 590,000 people on weekdays and 420,000 people on weekends and holidays use this area. As you can see from the graph above, various generations of people visited us, but men around 30 years old to 50 years old were less. Most likely, they use this area for only going to work.

</DD></DL><P>The interests among the people are concentrated to nuclear power plants and radiation pollution that are reported from the media a lot and topics that are related to health which is necessarily in our daily life. And we realized that people answered more to negative topics.
Also, when we see it from men's and women's perspective respectively, both genders are interested in medical care and health, but women are more interested in nuclear power plants and they 40% of women answered to this. (Men are about 30%). Also, as to iPS cells, 54% of men, 23% of women answered to this respectively.
</P><OL><LI> :The earthquake, which occurred on 11th of March at the east side of Japan, caused a huge radiation disaster.
</LI><LI> :After the earthquake, the topic appeared in the media almost every day.
</LI><LI> :This movie will be released in autumn2011 in Japan.
</LI><LI> :Prof. Akira Suzuki, the emeritus professor of Hokkaido University was awarded the Nobel Prize last year.
</LI><LI> :BSE problem was reported by the media.

</LI></UL><P>iPS cells was the third place that people were interested in among the science topics. As you can see from the result, comparative to Q1 and Q3, Q2 has a lower percentage. Probably, citizens have a tendency to see the good aspects of leading technologies from the information they get from the media.
