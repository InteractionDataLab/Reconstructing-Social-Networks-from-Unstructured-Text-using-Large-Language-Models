The way to become “citizens who can think by themselves”
In order to achieve the goal of becoming citizens who can think by themselves, we looked at what we could do with citizens.
We found a new way of communicating which introduced some factors below,
know what citizens already know about science
provide them correct knowledge about science
have them enjoy science
We think we need to break from our shell of lectures and workshops and make this method to be a more attractive one.
From this, a science gallery “BIO ART” was born.
