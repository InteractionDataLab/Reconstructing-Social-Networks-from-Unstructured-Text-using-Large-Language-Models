We reviewed and created a list of the following books about gene recombination on a leaflet for the visitors and provided them at the gallery. We tried to present both sides of discussion on GM products.
"Do you still eat genetically modified foods?"
2009, Andrew Kimbrell/ Kazuhiro Siroi/ Sinichi Fukuoka
The anther argues about demerits, personal and economic issues brought by GM foods with intensive and sensational style.
"Why are you worried about genetically modified foods?"
2002,Alan McHaqhen/ Watanabe Tadashi/ Hisamura Noriko
Current controversy on genetically modified is lacks scientific backing, arguments are based on emotions. This books start by explaining bioengineering basics and is easy to understand by layman. It is hard to distinguish cross bread crops from GM crops. And when you take pesticide into account it is hard to conclude which is safer, GM or non-GM. But we mustn't relax the control on it, owing to emergence of allergens, deterioration of ecosystem balance and so forth. We should not forge social, economic and ethical problems in which science has no say in. Most important is how we communicate correct information to the public setting.
"Why GM crops were developed? ---Sociology of Biotechnology"
1999, Yoshiki Ohtsuka
This book argues that genetically modified crops were not developed for the sake of technology or the pursuit of profits by companies. As a matter of fact, GM crops were the outcome of capitalism. Exploring state before and after of bio technology establishment, for the purpose of the commercialization of life. Intellectual property rights were advocated to find best way to solve the agricultural market saturation, environmental problems, and high cost for drug tolerance. Based on it, partnership among entities and network of multinational corporations result in development of GM crops.
"GMO's global production and regulation"
2006, Fujio Norioka/ Masashi Tachikawa
Based on technology and institutionalization U.S. is biggest porter of GM products. Inevitably trade friction occurs. Varying standards of labeling among U.S., EU, Australia, South America and China is also a inconvenience. In the international community, we need probe the analysis of these countries to get along well.
"Labeling and regulation of genetically modified foods"
2003, Keisuke Amagasa
Because of high food self-sufficiency, good traceability, and strict regulations, the diffusion of genetically modified foods is repressed in EU. Nevertheless, more GM foods imported from the U.S. are in circulation in Japan. There are so many problems. For instances, vague standard of labeling, lack of preventive measure, etc. This book investigates these issues comparing Japan with EU.
"World war on food"
2008, Keisuke Amagasa
Various counter movements are held against international companies around the world wielding genetic recombination technology getting traction. This book shows the influence of GM crops from the social point of view, and points out the problem about recombinant DNA techniques.
"Solving food crisis, progress of genetic recombination technique"
2009, Japan Society for the Promotion/ Plant Biotechnology 160 Committee
Theme is agricultural research results and expectation for the future. Examples include rice which protects from pollinosis or is supplement with vitamins and blue roses. You can see the potential of GM foods if you read it.
"Genetically Modified crops ---what is the problem?"
2001, Yoshiki Ohtsuka
In this book, circumstance of GM crops and its problem are explained in plain words and many concrete examples. Particularly, the writer points to inequality between scientists and citizens in terms of the depth of understanding about risks of GM crop's applications. He advocates’ for substantial information disclosure.
"Agriculture in the 21th century --Studies of Genetically Modified crops"
2006, Association of Japanese Agricultural Scientific Societies
Proceedings of symposium held by Association of Japanese Agricultural Scientific Societies(AJASS). Some topics are too technical for layman, but this book's virtue is detailed presentation on GM crops' advantages (e.g. dietary supplement, improved yield) and disadvantages (e.g. environmental ramifications of GM crops) by experts from various fields. Themes about effects on non-GM crops and ecosystems by pollen GM crops dispersal that are covered in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 are especially detailed. This book is helpful for discussion on GM regulation code by Hokkaido government.
"New developments of genetically-Modified crops and grain food systems --Sociological approach to agriculture and food"
2004, Masashi Tachikawa
This book was edited by Japans Research Institute, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (PRIMAFF). In this book, anther analyzes GM crops in term of food distribution and economics with the use of various statistics and graphs. It argues on added value to market by GM products.
