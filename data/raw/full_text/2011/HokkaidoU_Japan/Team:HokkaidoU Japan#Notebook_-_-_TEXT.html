IDEA: We use 2010 complex as substrate, and this is on pSB1T3 Vector. However, after replasing, the product is on pSB1A2 vector because TetR Promoter is on pSB1A2. So, cultivating the product in LBT, and then confirm that E.coli in LBT does not increase.

Thursday
Construction of BsaI backbone -1st try
STEP 3: Adding BsaI cloning site -1st try
Preparation of next day's PCR
IDEA: PCR template DNA (STEP 2 product) has two double terminators, so we were anxious that the PCR product would be full of smear because our forward primer is annealed to 5' terminal of double terminator seaquence. Thus, we thought it is nice to cut away the unwanted double terminator by digesting with endonucleases, NdeI and CpoI. The recognition site of NdeI is in GFP coding sequence, and the one of CpoI is in RFP sequence.
Digestion of STEP 2 product: NdeI, CpoI
result: FAILURE. We think the endonucleases are too old.
Friday
Primers came.
Construction of BsaI backbone -1st try
STEP 3: Adding BsaI cloning site -1st try
PCR with primers which have tails of BsaI cloning site.
Templete: STEP 2 product
F primer: BsaI_dt_F
R primer: BsaI_SlrP_R
Extension time: 2-minutes (Because the manual says that KOD_Plus_Neo (polymerase) will extend 1kbp/30sec, and PCR product will be 3.0kbp)
Because we fail to remove double terminator, we must deal with the primer mis-binding problem. So we decided to adopt "Step-Down PCR" protocol.
result: FAILURE. Extension time might be too short.

Construction of BsaI backbone -2nd try
STEP 4: Making circular plasmid -2nd try
result: FAILURE
We found a problem of SpeI/NotI double digestion. We thought that NotI would work with M buffer (ToYoBo or TaKaRa-Bio, same as NEBuffer4), but NotI will be work only in H Buffer (same as NEBuffer3), BSA and Triton must be added. So we cannot digest simultaneously. Thus, we decided to digest one by one.

NEW PROJECT: GSK Tag System (See here )
SUMMARY: As we wrote in abstract, we want to screen domains to see which ones can be injected by T3SS system. So, we need a simple system with which we can see whether the domain was injected or not. Using this system, we can judge the injectability with antibody. It is comparatively easy.
Order a primer (BsaI_GSK_SlrP_R).
Preparation for part registration.

result: We were able to sequence full length (pSB1K3-EX-TetR-RBS-SlrP-BsaIsite-GFP-BsaIsite-dt-SP-pSB1K3). Although a mutation in SlrP coding sequence was found, it was silent. No problems had occurred.
