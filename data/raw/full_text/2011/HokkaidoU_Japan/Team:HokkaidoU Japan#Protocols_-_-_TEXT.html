CIAA = Chloroform : IsoAmyl Alcohol = 24 : 1
Procedure
Add equal volume of PCIAA and vortex vigorously
Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 2 min at RT
Transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube, being careful not to transfer the phase interface
Add equal volume of CIAA and vortex vigorously
Transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube

Add 250 µl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times
Add 350 µl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge
Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting
Centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through
Recommended: Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. Discard the flow-through
Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer
Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of each QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min
