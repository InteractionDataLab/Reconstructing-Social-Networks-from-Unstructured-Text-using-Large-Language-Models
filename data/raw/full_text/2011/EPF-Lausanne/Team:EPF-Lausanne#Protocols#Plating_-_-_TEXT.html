Plating
Back to protocols .
When you incubate transformed cells at 37°C, also put the agar plates to warm them up. After one hour:
Under the flame, put 100 ul of cells in the plate
Put autoclaved beads in the plate and shake it
Put the beads in the "used" box
The plates have to stay at 37°C overnight
