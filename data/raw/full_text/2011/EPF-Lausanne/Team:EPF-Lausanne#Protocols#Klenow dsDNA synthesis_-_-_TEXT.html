Klenow dsDNA synthesis
Back to protocols .
made on 5.07.2011
Materials
5’Comp Cy5 primer
5’Cy5-GTC ATA CCG CCG GAGG
order from IDT at 1umole, HPLC purified
suspend to 500uM
Library primers:
5’ Linker - BINDING SITE – CCTCCGGCGGTATGAC
5’ Linker generally: CCC
Klenow Fragment 3’-5’ exo-
Order from NEB (Cat #: M0212L)
dNTPs at 10mM each
Method
Synthesis reaction

Final volume
Prepare a master mix without the library primer, and load 28μL into a 96 well plate.
Add 2μL of Library primer to the 96 well plate.
Cycle as follows:
37°C for 1 hour
75°C for 20 mins
ramp down to 30°C at 0.1°C/sec
hold at 4°C
After the synthesis add 70μL of 0.5% BSA in dH2O to each well and transfer to a 384 well plate (flat bottom). Prepare dilutions as needed using 0.5% BSA dH2O.
To set up the 384-well  plate with 6 dilutions load 30uL 0.5% BSA dH2O into all columns except 1, 7, 13, 19.
Transfer the column 1 of the klenow reaction (100uL total) to column 1 row A (A1) on the 384 well plate. Perform 5 dilutions of 70uL sample into the adjacent wells containing 30uL BSA dH2O. After the 5th dilution (in column 6) discard the remaining 70uL.
Transfer column 2 of the klenow plate into A7 and perform dilutions.
Column3 -> A13, column 4 -> A19, Column 5->B1, col 6-> B7,  col7->B13, col8 -> B19
You should have 30uL of target DNA in each well of the 384 plate now. Add 30uL of 0.5% BSA dH2O to each well.
The samples are now ready to be spotted.
