iGEM being a competition between students, we worked as independently as possible. Once having been taught all the useful procedures, we did them on our own and analyzed the data before presenting them to the instructors and teaching assistants on our weekly meetings. We also planned the experiments needed to be done each week.
Being a small group, each student specialized on one part of the project, such as using the MITOMI or creating the T7 promoter variants. This allowed us to spend less time on learning the procedures; especially true for the microfluidics setups. The different parts of the project are detailed below, with the name of the student that worked on each task. The teaching assistants were assigned to the different tasks based on their personal competence; this does not mean that they completed the task, but rather that they taught us how to do it and answered our questions relative to it.
