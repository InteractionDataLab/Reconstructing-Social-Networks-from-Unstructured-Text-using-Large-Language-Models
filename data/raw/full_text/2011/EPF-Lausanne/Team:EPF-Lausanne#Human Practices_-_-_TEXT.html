Human practices
Instead of reaching out to the general population, we decided for our Human Practices to introduce the iGEM community to microfluidics. We took advantage of our university's expertise in this area to integrate it in our project, and hope that our work will inspire others to adopt the technology. Our work towards this is presented in the Project section, under the header Microfluidics .
