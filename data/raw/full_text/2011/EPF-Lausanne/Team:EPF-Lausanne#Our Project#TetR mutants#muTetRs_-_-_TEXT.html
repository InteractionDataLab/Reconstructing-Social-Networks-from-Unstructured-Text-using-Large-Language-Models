Mutant TetRs
In vitro Main | Why TetR? | Mutant TetRs | MITOMI Data | In-vivo & In-vitro outline
Strategy
Having done a litterature search, we decided to focus first on mutating some key amino acids rather than going for random mutations. The most important residues seem to be the V36, E37, P39 and Y42 ones.
We used two distinct strategies to create these mutants:
Site-specific mutagenesis , which consists of both a plasmid amplification step with forward and reverse primers containing the targeted mutation and a selection step (enzymatic digestion of the methylated dsDNA)
PCR-induced mutagenesis , which specifically amplifies two halves of the gene of interest from a linear template and introduces a mutation in one of them, followed by a stich-PCR to join the two halves and add the necessary extensions.
The plasmid that we used had a C-terminal eGFP fusion to the TetR, while the linear template had a C-terminal His-tag. The promoters added were SP6 in the first case and T7 in the second.
