We would like to thank Robopoly , in particular Yves Chevallier and Andrew Watson, for their help in designing and manufacturing printed circuit boards for the the microfluidic game.
Many thanks also to the Gönczy lab , in particular Prof. Pierre Gönczy and Ph.D. candidate Lukas Tobel, for giving us a batch of C. Elegans, as well as their advice on care and feeding of the worms.
Thank you to  Sacha Sidjanski and  Caroline O'Neill for their help with the fundraising for our project.
Thank you to Solange, from last year's EPFL iGEM team, for having lent us her hand and brushes and drawn us a fantastic logo and illustrative cartoons.
Thank you finally to the Biomedical Imaging Group for lending us a Mac Pro for video transcoding.
