Wildtype TetR
In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the wild type TetR. To do so, we first designed and generated the library of double-stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitutions within the TetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to all the tetO-like sequences of the library. Then, we determined the specificity of the mutant to the Tet operator sequence, expressed as a position-weight matrix (PWM).
The enoLOGO we obtained for the wild-type is:

Each row represents the changes in binding energy,  ΔΔG (kcal/mol), compared to the reference sequence upon the substitution to the indicated nucleotide at certain position within the target DNA element. Values are indicated in kcal/mol.
We compared the measured DNA binding affinities of the V36F mutant to the affinities obtained for the  wt-TetR and found that V36F mutant interacts with the TetO as strongly as the wild-type variant.
E37A W43S T141A
BBa_K613015
In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR E37A  W43S T141A  mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM).
The measured DNA binding affinities of the E37A W43S T141A mutant show that these mutations alter the sequence recognition, while the symmetry and the spacer affinities are conserved.
The enoLOGO we obtained for the E37A W43S T141A mutant:

P39K
BBa_K613016
In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR P39K mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM).
The enoLOGO we obtained for the P39K mutant:
The strong difference of the binding affinities between the P39K mutant and the wtTetR, might be due to the altered recognition of the P39K. This mutant was shown to have  a new recognition specificity for the tetO-4C operator in Helbl et al, 1998 .

Y42F
BBa_K613017
In Vitro Characterization
Using the MITOMI technique we determined the DNA binding landscape of the TetR Y42F mutant. To do so, first we designed and generated the library of double stranded DNA sequences that cover all possible single base substitution within the tetO operator sequence. Based on that library we measured the dissociation constants of the mutant to variable tetO-like sequences and determined the specificity of the mutant to the tet operator sequence (expressed as a PWM). For the Y42F mutant we observed the decrease of the specificity compared to the wild-type tetR sequence.
The enoLOGO we obtained for the Y42F mutant:
The measured binding affinities show no symmetry conservation and the contribution of the outer bases equals that of the inner.  These experiment will have to be repeated in order to get a clearer idea of the binding affinities.
