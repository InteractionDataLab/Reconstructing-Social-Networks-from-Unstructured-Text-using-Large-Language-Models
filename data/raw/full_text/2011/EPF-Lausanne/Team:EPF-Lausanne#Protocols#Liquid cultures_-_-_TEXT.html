Back to protocols .
As we are dealing with bacteria, work under a flame!
First, prepare the medium in a falcon tube. One tube per colonie you will pick:
5 ml LB medium (be careful not to touch the walls of the bottle!)
5ul ampicillin (or other antibiotic)
Then, for each colonie, drop a tip in it (don't make a hole in the agar) and put the tip in the tube. The tubes should be incubated overnight at 37°C; put the tubes 30°C inclined.
