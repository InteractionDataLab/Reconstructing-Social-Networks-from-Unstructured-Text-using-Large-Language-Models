T7 Promoter Variants
Introduction
Our goal is to make two families of T7 promoter variants. One family has mutations on the T7 promoter consensus sequence while the other has the same set of mutations on the consensus sequence but also has a lac operator downstream of the T7 promoter. In each family, we produce six designed variants with different predicted promoter strengths compared to the wildtype as well as three sets of randomer variants which we want to use to check the overall range of promoter strengths.
