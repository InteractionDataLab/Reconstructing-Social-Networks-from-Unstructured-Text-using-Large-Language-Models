Molecular Biology
Products and stock preparation
Primer preparation : initial dilution of ordered primers.
Competent Cells : prepare cells for plasmid uptake.
Competent Cells. Protocol II (Inoue method) .
Glycerol stock : stock transformed cells at -80°C.
Agar plate preparation : preparing agar plates for cell cultures.
Autoclave : to sterilize solutions and glassware.
Cloning, assembly, and mutations
Transformation : introduce foreign plasmid into competent cells.
Plating : plate transformed cells
Liquid cultures : when cells have grown on plates, put them in liquid cultures
Gibson assembly .
Linear template- TetR .
tetR Overlap Extension PCR : induce specific mutations on tetR linear template.
tetR Site-specific mutagenesis : induce site-specific mutations on a plasmid containing tetR.
Agarose gel electrophoresis : DNA samples analysis (can be followed by band purification).
Colony PCR : Analyze the plated transformed cells, to see if Gibson assembly worked
T7 extension PCR : Put T7 promoter upstream of a gene
Blunt-End Cloning : Making Blunt Ends
DNA recovery
Plasmid preparation - Miniprep : recover plasmids from a bacterial culture.
Gel purification : recover DNA separated by electrophoresis
Biochemistry
IPTG test : test expression of a gene downstream from Plac
Microfluidics
PDMS two layer device fabrication
Master microfabrication for PDMS replica molding
MITOMI: Protein – DNA interactions
Klenow dsDNA synthesis
Worm culture
Agar plate preparation : preparing MG Agar plates for worm cultures.
