Microfluidics-work in progress
For the in vivo and in vitro characterization of our mutant transcription factors, we used two high-troughput microfluidic devices, a cell culture chip and respectively a fluidic platform for measuring molecular binding events, called "MITOMI".
The field of microfluidics has as an objective the manipulation and analysis of fluids within micrometer-sized channels, which, due to the small size, must be microfabricated using techniques adapted from the semiconductor and plastics industries.
The advantages of this technique include:
low sample and reagent volumes leading to lower costs low waste levels
unique physical properties of microscale fluid flow
the reduction of the size of equipment
fast analysis and short reaction times
parallel operation for multiple analyses
possibility of portable devices.
