Autoclave
Back to protocols .
Before putting your bottles into the autoclave, check what is the bottles with the highest volume
Set the same volume (with distilled water) in the reference bottle (the one already inside the autoclave with the temperature sensor already in it)
Put your bottles into the autoclave
Set "Liquids" as parameter
Click "Start"
In case of error, just read the description. If the error is "Fill water" you have to put distilled water on the top of the autoclave (the wihte circular opening); be careful on doing it slowly (the metal hook have not to touch the water).
