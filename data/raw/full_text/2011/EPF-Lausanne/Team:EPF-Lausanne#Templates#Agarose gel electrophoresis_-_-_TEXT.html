Agarose gel electrophoresis
Written on 01.07.2011
Purpose
To analyse DNA composition of a sample. Voltage-dependent DNA migration through agarose gel allows sequences separation according to their size.
Ingredients & Materials
For a 1% agarose gel
Ingredients for different gel cast sizes
Small
Medium
Big: 26 wells
Agarose
0.5g
50ml
1.25µl
TBE 1x buffer
1g
100ml
2.5µl
GelRed
2g
200ml
5µl
Sample loading buffer will also be needed.
Materials: bottle, tray, cast, comb, electrophoresis chamber, voltage/current generator, pipette, microwave, weight, spoon, labcoat...
Method
To prepare the gel:
Weight agarose, place it into a bottle with a cap, add TBE 1x buffer
Place the bottle into a microwave, <gras>loosen the cap</gras>, heat it untill it almost boils and the agar is dissolved
Cool it down until it can be hold (that can be done under water)
Add 1.25µl of GelRed
Pour into the casting tray (it is easy to assemble the casting but a way to difficult to discribe), put the comb and wait until it polymerizes
To run the gel:
Take out the comb and place the tray with your gel into the electrophoresis chamber (usually already filled with buffer) so that your wells are nearer to the cation, red side.
TBE 1x buffer should be covering the tray, add more if needed
In a PCR tube mix ~10µl of your sample with 1.5µl of loading solution (quantities indicated may vary with the sample concentration )
Load about 5µl of your sample (this quantity varies with the thickness of the comb used and DNA concentration) and DNA ladder onto gel, taking care not to diffuse it and not to displace the gel
Place the cover, red wire to red side and inversely, plug it into the tension/current generator
On the generator set for voltage: constant mode 80V and time: 60min   (faster run with higher voltage as for example 150V may affect the quality of bands separation)
After run is over, take the tray out on some plate, and bring it to visualize DNA bands to a UV lightbox or gel imaging system
Gel can be disposed in a normal biological waste or kept covered in an aluminum foil
