Transformation
Back to protocols .
Transformation is the introduction of a foreign plasmid into competent cells. We follow the protocol from last year's team: 2010 protocol
Additional notes
The protocol specifies to ask Henrike for plasmid quantities. Here is her answer:
For relatively pure plasmids, 1 ul is enough.
For low concentration plasmids, like those originating from a Gibson assembly, use 2 to 3 ul.
If you are conducting the heat shock in an eppendorf tube, use 45 seconds instead of 30.
