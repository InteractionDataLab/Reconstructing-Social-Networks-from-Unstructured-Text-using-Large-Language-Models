Glycerol stock
Back to protocols .
Material needed: overnight cultures of transformed cells (do not centrifuge them) and glycerol 50%
Mix gently the cell cultures to resuspend the pellet
In an Effendorf tube, put 500 ul of glycerol 50% and 500 ul of cell culture (always keep 1:1 ratio)
Label the tube
Mix gently and put the Eppendrofs quickly in the -80°C freezer (glycerol is toxic for the cells)
