T7 extension PCR
Back to protocols .
This protocols consists in 3 steps:
Gene specific-PCR: amplifies the gene you want to put under the control of the T7 promoter  adding RBS upstream and overhangs for the next PCR
Extension PCR: adds the T7 promoter (or its variants) upstream the gene and overhangs for the Gibson assembly
Final PCR: amplifies the fragments extending the gibson overhangs
Gene specific-PCR
Just a normal PCR to amplify the genes. The primers should include the RBS and overhangs with the extension primers
Extension PCR
With Hifi+ enzyme:
10 uL 5X Buffer
1 uL dNTPs
0.5 ul 5' ext primer (500 nM)
0.5 ul 3' ext primer (500 nM)
1 uL product of gene specific PCR
0.5 ul Hifi+
to 50 ul H2O
10 cycles
annealing temperature = 55°C
extension time = depends on length (about 1kb/minute)
Ask Henrike for the primers.
Final PCR
When the previous PCR is done, open the PCR machine (don't wait too long) and add 0.5 uL of each final -gibson primers (at 50 uM) (I made a mix, so just add 1 uL of it). Use the same protocol as before but run for 35 cycles and set annealing temperature as 47°C (or 50°C).
