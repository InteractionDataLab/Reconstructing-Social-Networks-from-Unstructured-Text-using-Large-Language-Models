Initial primer dilution
Back to protocols .
When receiving new primers, we need to add water in them on order to achieve 50 microM concentration. One rapid method is to:
take the value "nmol yield" on the synthesis report and multiply it 20x to have the needed microliters of water
spin down the primers tube to be sure that all DNA is at the bottom
add the calculated amount of water in each tube, then mix them
