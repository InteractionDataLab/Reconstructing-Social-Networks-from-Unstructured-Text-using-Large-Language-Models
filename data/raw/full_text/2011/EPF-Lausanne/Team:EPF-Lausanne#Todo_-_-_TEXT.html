General
Edit the Google doc inventory, SPECIFY THE NAMES you put on the tubes if they are not straightforward!
Keep an eye on the SOC and LB medium stocks to be sure they are not contaminated
Keep an eye on the stocks of agar plates
Supplies
Pick up new ladder and Hifi PLUS enzyme from magasin, when they are received.
Preparing the parts
Sequence the lysis cassette
Double-check lysis cassette sequence
All the parts are verified, we can now assemble them!
Assembly
Plasmids
Research plasmid backbones. Is there one that already contains Tet-repressed LacI or GFP?
Design Gibson primers to assemble the different plasmids.
Think of new assemblies we want to make (pTet with RFP, for example)
Reporter plasmids:
J61002 plasmid:
add pTet: OK, colony PCR works
add
Plac-RFP
or Plac-lysis
add Ptet-LacI subsequently: not needed anymore
TetR plasmid
J23019 plasmid:
PCR failed so far => test new plasmids for the TetR plasmid
pSB3C5 plasmid:
Gibson transformation failed => try with pSB3K1
pSB3K1 plasmid:
add Pconst-TetR
cut out RFP and religate
sequence
add Ptet-LacI
sequence
Specifically:
Run PCRs and gels on existing sequences (plasmid backbone, TetR gene, RFP) to prepare the parts
extract the correct parts from the gel and purify (or purify directly PCR products)
Make a Gibson reaction
Transform cells -> plates -> liquid cultures
From the plates, make a colony PCR
Miniprep the plasmids from cultures, send for sequencing
TetR mutants
determine required sequences
order primers
Amplify linear template TetR-His to get a clean starting material for mutagenesis or extension PCR strategies (previous amplification result contains an additional band over 200bp it might have influenced the results)
[Mutation-inducing extension PCR for MITOMI: ] <-- Temporarily left to the side, in favour of site-specific mutagenesis
Possibly rerun PCR; until decent results are obtained for all 6 mutations
Extract by gel purification
Site-specific mutagenesis:
Receive primers
Run mutagenesis
Transform cells
Finish preparing media
Redo mutagenesis with a new kit (Alina has it)
MITOMI
For wtTetR
repeat MITOMI with wtTetR His-tagged (linear template) and wtTetR GFP-tagged (plasmid), for consensus and negative control sequence. DNA spotted in different concentrations
experiment with de Brujin library spotted on His-wtTetR or/and wtTetR-GFP  (this will yield PWM)
experiment planned on July 26
1-off library on wtTetR linear template
Further, check the ordered muTetRs  (determine position weight matrix)
determine position weight matrix for muTetRs, compare with de Brujin results
Microfluidics and chemostat chip
Continue alignment training
Repeat experiments to check design
Grow E. Coli from spotted arrays
[No microfluidics] Setup a plate and test tween concentrations
Determine growth rate as function of tween concentration (say 0.075% +- 0.7, as many increments as will fit on the chip)
Adapt design of "chemostat" chip for e-coli
Wiki
requirements
The team's project must be documented on the iGEM Wiki by the deadline.
All team pages on the iGEM Wiki must be in the team namespace.
The team's project description must be documented on their iGEM Team Wiki by the deadline. The project description should be 1-3 paragraphs and only needs to include an up-to-date explanation of the project.
The team's wiki must include a Safety page and an attributions section.
Safety in "Considerations" and Attributions in "Our project"
All iGEM Team Wikis must include on the front page the iGEM logo and a visible link back to the iGEM 2011 Wiki Main Page
.
General
Make sure we comply with the Requirements !
Make a banner
.
Write-up team presentation
Upload our initial research about transcription factors
Document our choice. We spend a few weeks on this, show how we decided. One criteria for tetR was the amount of research already done for it. Another was low cost...
Fill-in attributions and contributions and decide where it should go on the wiki
Create data page
It might make sense to merge the "resources" and "tools" menus into "Background", where we discuss our choices of transcription factor, and present our tools: Microfluidics, Gibson assembly, etc.
Assembly
Make a page that explains the assembly strategy, and sequence of assembly: what plasmids were made in what sequence, and where all the components come from. For example, when we make J61002-LacI-Lysis, how many parts are we assembling? Where were those parts taken from in the PCR step? Use copious illustrations.
Protocols
Describe cell cultures in miniprep protocol
Create protocol Template, with "Back to protocols" link at top
Include an easy printing option seriously work on printing template.
Write a new protocol!
Front Page
Eventually (i.e when the project is approaching completion), the following should be present on the front page:
Project abstract
Link to the Data Page
Sponsors
Pretty layout...
Clean room
Order lab notebook
Order storage box
Judging requirements (copied from 2011.igem.org)
Bronze:
Team registration
Complete Project Summary form
Team Wiki
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
Silver: In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements...
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Gold: In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry).
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
