PDMS two layer device fabrication
Back to protocols .
made on 16.05.2011
Materials
flow and control layer molds
Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit: Base part and a Curing agent
TMCS
Method
1    Place molds into a TMCS vapor chamber
2a) Control layer mixture: 20g Base + 4g Curing agent
2b) Mix for 1 minute, degas for 2 minutes (standard protocol)
2c) Pour onto control layer mold and place mold in vacuum chamber for at least 20min
3a) Flow layer mixture: 20g Base + 1g Curing agent
3b) Mix for 1 minute and degas for 2 minutes (standard protocol)
3c) Spin coat onto flow layer at 2200-2400rpm for 35secs
4  Remove control layer mold from vacuum chamber, making sure no bubbles are left on the surface (remove with a toothpick if you see some )
5  Place the control and flow layer in a 80C convection oven and incubate for 30 minutes (timing is critical here!)
6a) cut out control layer
6b) punch holes
6c) align to flow layer
7  Put aligned device back into 80C oven and incubate for at least 90 minutes (and here you can increase the backing time)
8a) Remove devices from oven
8b) cut them out
8c) punch flow layer holes and cut the edges through the flow layer
To clean the wafers use:
Air-gun
Isopropanol
PDMS
