Conclusions
In the same way as with the proteolysis system, here we are repressing both State 2 reporter and State 1 repressor when State 1 is the dominant. The conclusions of this mechanism are the same that with proteolysis: RFP residual signal will be minimized while PcI expression will be enhanced, as it won’t be repressed. By doing this, we will shorten the switching time between states and obtain the clearest signal difference.
