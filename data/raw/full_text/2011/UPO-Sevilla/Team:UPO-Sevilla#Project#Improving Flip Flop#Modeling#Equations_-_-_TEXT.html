Improving Flip Flop

We define the reactions and the parameters involved in the system.
First we show a summary of the species:
Species:
Promoter1
Promoter2
mRNA1
mRNA2
Repressor1/r1
Repressor2
Ribosomes
IPTG
asRNA
Protease
Parameters:
Km : Michaelis constant of transcription
Kmu: Michaelis constant of translation
δ: mRNA rate of degradation
λ: mRNA maximum rate of synthesis
k: Repressor rate of synthesis
Kiu: Dissociation constant of repression
γ: Cooperativity of inhibition by the repressor
Ki: Binding constant for IPTG to the repressor
η: Maximum number of bound IPTG molecule per repressor
ktemp: Degradation constant due to the temperature effect
kprs: Rate constant for proteolysis kinetic
kinh: Rate constant for inhibition of translation
δ3: Degradation rate of asRNA
kptsa: Degradation rate of Protease
The new equations that complement the basic flip-flop model are:
Proteolysis
protease + repressor1 → protease
Rate law:
Inhibition of translation
asRNA + mRNA1 → RNA1 complex
Rate law:
