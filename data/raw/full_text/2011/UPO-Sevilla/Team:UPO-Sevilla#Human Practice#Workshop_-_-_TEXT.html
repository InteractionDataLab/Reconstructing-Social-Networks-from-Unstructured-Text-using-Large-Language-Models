Workshop
Part of the iGEM experience is the exchange of information and knowledge between the different teams. Workshops make it possible, by getting together instructors of all the region’s teams and the heads of iGEM. This unique situation allows to provide feedback between the contestants and the organizers, and to improve the competition each year. Also, each team has the chance to give a small talk on their project and see what the others are working on. These meetings are the breeding ground of new ideas and collaborations, so why not organising one ourselves? This way our team’s undergraduates will then have the chance to meet the actual creators of synthetic biology and the heads of other teams.
The European iGEM Workshop was finally hosted in Carmona, a town near Seville, where our university has the infrastructure to held big meetings. The location is provided with near accommodations in a privileged landscape. More than 50 scientists finally assisted and participated in the different talks and discussions, in what constitutes the first meeting of this new biology field in Andalucía, and among the few that have taken place in Spain.
