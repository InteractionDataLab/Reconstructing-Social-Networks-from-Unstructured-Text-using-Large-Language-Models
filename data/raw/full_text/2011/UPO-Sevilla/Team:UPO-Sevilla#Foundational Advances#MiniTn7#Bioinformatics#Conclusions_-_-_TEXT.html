Conclusions
The main conclusions of this phylogenetic sequence analysis are listed below:
The C-terminal part of the Glms protein is highly conserved among the phylogeny.
A consensus sequence can be obtained for the attTn7 insertion site for those organisms which already have a Tn7 family transposon. In this consensus the first two positions at each codon are conserved. In addition, the translation of this consensus nucleotide sequence is identical to the C-terminal amino acids of Glms protein.
A consensus attTn7 site sequence can be also obtained for organisms of all kingdoms. This sequence also shows conservation only in the first two positions of each codon. The translation of this consensus sequence also gives the expected Glms amino acidic sequence. What is more, this consensus sequence is highly similar to the Tn7 organisms attTn7 consensus sequence.
A consensus attTn7 insertion site has been obtained which should be included in our miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit and it should work at least in all the organisms which appear in these studies.
