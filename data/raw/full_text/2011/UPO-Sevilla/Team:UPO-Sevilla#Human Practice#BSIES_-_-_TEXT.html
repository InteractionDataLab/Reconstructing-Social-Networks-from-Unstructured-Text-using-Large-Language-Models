BSIES
The iGEM team UPO-Sevilla wanted to be the first in spreading the basis of Synthetic Biology based on parts in High Schools of Spain, mainly in Andalucía. The BSIES program (Synthetic Biology in High Schools; an acronym of Biología Sintética en Institutos de Educación Secundaria) consists of a series of talks given by the student members of the team in high schools. During these talks the young students catch a first glimpse of Synthetic Biology and and its applications and we set up a discussion about the fast advance of science and the ethics behind it. We did not want to ask them about their thoughts about SB, as many other teams did. Instead, we wanted them to ask us in order to fill their gaps and make them understand this new field of science better and know the moral concerns lying between our society and the way SB develops.
Below you can see a summary of each talk, including photos, some of the students questions and our answers.
