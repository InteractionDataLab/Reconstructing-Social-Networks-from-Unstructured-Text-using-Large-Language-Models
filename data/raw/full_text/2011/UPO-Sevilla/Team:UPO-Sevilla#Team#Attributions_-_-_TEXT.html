The project team structure can be seen at the Team page. All work has been developed by the undergraduate students of the team. The main role of the instructors has been to give advice through project or subproject meetings, and provide access and space at their labs. Moreover, all the contents on the wiki have been produced by the students, with some polishing by the instructors.
Here we show the attributions of the different subprojects:
The miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit subproject has been fully developed by David Caballero, a third-year student of Biotechnology, under the supervision of Fernando Govantes, Associate Professor of Microbiology. All lab-work and design of miniTn7 derivatives has been undergone by this student and periodically debated in UPO-Sevilla team meetings. For more information about the work behind this Foundational Advance project, please read David Caballero's diary .
The BioBrick Creator software tool has been fully coded by José Gutiérrez, an undergrad on Computer Science, with the help of Aída Moreno, a last-year student of Biotechnology. They have been instructed mainly by Associate Professor Antonio J. Pérez, PhD on Bioinformatics. More details can be found in the associated notebook .
The experiments and characterization of the Basic Flip-Flop have been performed and analyzed by Amalia Martínez (check her diary for further information), undergraduate student of Biotechnology, under the supervision of Fernando Govantes.
The Spatial Multiagent Simulation of the Basic Flip-Flop, employing the tool NetLogo, has been developed completely by Adrián Arellano, a third-year undergrad student of Biotechnology. He has designed and implemented the interfaces and the code associated with the simulation ( his diary ). He has been instructed by Luis Merino, Associate Professor on Systems Engineering and Automation, which contributed with advice in the development of the simulations and discussions on the results.
The development of the Improved Flip-Flop has been carried out by Yolanda Elisabeth González and Félix Reyes, both third-year undergraduate students of Biotechnology, under the instruction of Víctor Álvarez, Associate Professor in Genetics. Their struggle along the summer can be found here .
All the lab work, experimental design and analysis in the development of the Epigenetic Flip-Flop has been performed by Paola Gallardo ( her diary ), third-year undergrad on Biotechnology. She has been instructed by Rafael Rodriguez, Associate Professor of Genetics, who has collaborated in the design of the device and has provided further advice.
The Bioinformatics tools and analysis of the the Improved Flip-Flop and the Epigenetic Flip-Flop , as well as the miniTn7 BioBrick Tool have also been performed by Aída Moreno (check her daily work on this), under the instruction of Antonio J. Pérez.
The Wiki design and code, as well as management, is due to Luis Eduardo Pavón, a Computer Science undergrad ( his diary ), supervised by Luis Merino and all the UPO-Sevilla team.
The modeling (using MATLAB and MATLAB's Simbiology) and the mathematical analysis of the Basic and Improved Flip-Flops has been carried out by Jesús Jiménez, an undergrad on Mechanical and Systems Engineering. He has developed the Simbiology models and MATLAB code in full, under the supervision of Manuel Béjar and Luis Merino, as it is narrated in his diary .
