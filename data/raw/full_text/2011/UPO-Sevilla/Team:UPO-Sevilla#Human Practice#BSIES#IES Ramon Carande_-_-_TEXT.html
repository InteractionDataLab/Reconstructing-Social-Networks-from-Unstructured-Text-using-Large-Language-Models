What’s Creative Commons?
Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon legally and to share. The organization has released several copyright-licenses known as Creative Commons licenses free of charge to the public. These licenses allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve, and which rights they waive for the benefit of recipients or other creators. Creative Commons was invented to create a more flexible copyright model, replacing "all rights reserved" with "some rights reserved".
And what’s the relationship between Creative Commons and Synthetic Biology?
iGEM contest follows a Creative Commons licence, which lets all scientific community to use other past teams work just by referring to the original authors. “Once we have enough pieces that fix together the next step is to let everyone use all of them without any legal problems and modify them in order to make them fit with the rest”.
