Carmen: Could our expetations lie in sinthetic biology to revolutionize the science?
It’s too soon to see how the BS will develop in a few years however we have hope in this scientific field. BS provides several tools to improve the investigation thanks bioinformatic softwares and mathematics modellings analysis. Besides, the fact of using standard parts will provoke that science progresses faster.
Victoria: Could sinthetic biology create life at some point? I would like to mention the recent investigation of Craig Venter which is, in some way, related to this question.
After many years of analysis and investigation of life, it's time to start using that knowledge and create biological machines. Nowadays it possible modify wild organism creating this biological machines and fitting its with ours problems. However, except some privilege minds (for example Craing Venter), we cannot create life from scratch today.
Rodrigo: Sinthetic biology is viewed by some as a potential weapon, which is your point of view about it?
SB could be used as a tool for unacceptable purposes in the same way that a knife it is really useful in the kitchen but dangerous in the hands of a killer. SB has a great potential, if we use it to create or to destroy depends on ourselves. Ethical commities are necessary to harness the potential of Synthetic Biology so it is not used for harmful or unethical purposes.
Domingo: Is sinthetic biology limited by the ban of manipulating human genes?
t’s difficult to specify when a gen is from human or another organism. It’s totally legal manipulate human genes from other species which work in the same way that genes. Nevertheless genetical human experimention is still banned today unless the law would change. In this line, BS provides the necessary technics to investigate with human genes without humans.
