Week of Science
On the occasion of the celebration of the Week of Science in our university, Pablo de Olavide, there were organized a group of spreading activities to bring public and science closer. Some of the activities were: conferences, workshops, competitions, expositions, guided tours, practical introductions of working in the laboratory for high-school students.
UPO-Sevilla Team take part on this activities by giving a talk on November 19th called “Active learning in the limits of biology: UPO in the Synthetic Biology contest iGEM” . We introduced synthetic biology as an emerging experimental and theoretical science and as a new field which has came up of Molecular Biology, Engineering and Informatics. We also introduced the iGEM and the fantastic experience in our first participation. A golden opportunity to share with our university and encourage them to get involved in it. You can enjoy watching the conference .
