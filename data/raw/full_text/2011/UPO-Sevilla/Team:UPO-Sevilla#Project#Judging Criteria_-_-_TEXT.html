The UPO-Sevilla team is registered in iGEM 2011. Actually, we were among the first four teams in registering this year .
We have completed the judging form.
We have design a Wiki full of information about our project and our team.
We presented a poster and a talk in the iGEM Jamboree.
We have submitted 31 new BioBricks and BioBrick compatible plasmids. We have sent the physical DNA for 13 new parts and plasmids (our favourite parts). And we have characterized 5 new parts and plasmids, which works as expected. Also, we have characterized by mathematical modeling, multi-agent modeling and quantitative experimental assays a previous existing BioBrick . We have entered this information in the experience section of the part in the Registry.
Silver
We have demonstrated that two new BioBrick compatible plasmids for BioBrick genome integration ( BBa_K510000 , BBa_K510012 ) designed by our team works as expected. The portable insertion site of the Tn7 transposon and its derivatives ( BBa_K510022 ) has been fully characterized and also works as expected. Finally we have characterized the correct funcion or our impreoved flip-flop (made by two modules: BBa_K510019 , BBa_K510019 )
We have characterized the operation of these two plasmids ( BBa_K510000 , BBa_K510012 ) and these three parts ( BBa_K510022 , BBa_K510019 , BBa_K510036 ); and we have entered this information into the “Main Page” and “Experience page” sections of their Registry entry.
Gold
We have improved the function of the existing BioBrick Device BBa_K177038 which works as a Flip-Flop system by designing an improved Flip-Flop which includes translational and proteolysis control besides of transcriptional control of the preexisting Flip-Flop. We have entered the information of the two new devices which make the improved Flip-Flop ( BBa_K510019 , BBa_K510036 ) in the Registry.
About Human Practice issues, we have carried out several approaches for spreading the basis of Synthetic Biology. We have launched the first blog about Synthetic Biology in Spanish, Tornillos y Genes , with 13.000 visitors by now. This blog will allow an easier dissemination of Synthetic Biology among Spanish-speaking people, and will engage in SB more people from different backgrounds. We have developed a SB spreading program in High schools of Spain, consisting of talks given by the student members of the team. Moreover, we have taken part in two science fairs for all public: Sevilla Science Fair and the Week of Science of Pablo de Olavide University .
