Plasmid Backbone
How does it work?
You can upload your raw DNA sequence using TXT or FASTA format files.
For FASTA format files, if your files have incorrect or missing characters, it has to be fixed beforehand. For multiFASTA files, this aplication only reads the first sequence.
For TXT files, aplication will read every character inside the file, so after it has to erase the information not useful.
You can choose the standard DNA-shipping plasmid backbone pSB1C3 or choose another different plasmid for your build construction:
Part Assembly
Reshma's low and medium copy operation plasmid backbones
Additional low and medium copy operation plasmid backbones
Inducible copy number operation plasmid backbones
Multi-host operation plasmid backbones
Eukaryotic operation plasmid backbones
Plasmids used in DNA synthesis of BioBrick parts
