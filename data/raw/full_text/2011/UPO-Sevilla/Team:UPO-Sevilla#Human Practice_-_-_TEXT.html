iGEM is more than a scientific project! iGEM is a way to make thousands of people around the world feel bearers of the Synthetic Biology spirit. We felt part of it soon this year and started to work to spread our knowledge on SB along our country and even more. With this aim we arranged a Synthetic Biology awareness program for High Schools (BSIES) where we discussed about science, technology and ethics with high school students and teachers; we took part in scientific fairs, where we discussed Synthetic Biology with younger kids and families; and we organized the 2011 Europe Workshop. Also we started the first blog on Synthetic Biology in Spanish: Tornillos y genes. as a way to bring SB closer to non-English speakers. Several media appearances also contributed to give visibility to Synthetic Biology and our team's work at both regional and national scale.
Thanks to all these efforts, the UPO-Sevilla team received the prized to Best Human Practices Advance in Europe!
