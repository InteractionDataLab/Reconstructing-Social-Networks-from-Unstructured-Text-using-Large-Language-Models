Creating a new BioBrick
How does it work?
There are three levels of BioBrick parts: parts, devices and systems.  Parts are the building blocks and encode basic biological functions  (such as encoding a certain protein, or providing a promoter to let RNA polymerase  bind and initiate transcription of downstream sequences.
You can choose what part type you want convert to BioBrick standard, you can tick between:
Protein Sequence Coding
Protein coding sequences encode the amino acid sequence of a particular protein. Note that some protein coding sequences only encode a protein domain or half a protein. Others encode a full-length protein from start codon to stop codon. Besides, you can choose a codon optimization depending on a specific organism.
DNA
DNA sequence with a known function which can't be automatically optimized due to possible functional losses.
Characterized Sequence
DNA parts provide functionality to the DNA itself. DNA parts include cloning sites, scars, primer binding sites, spacers, recombination sites, conjugative tranfer elements, transposons, origami, and aptamers.
To use your own sequence, simply write or paste your raw DNA sequence in 5'-3' or upload your raw DNA sequence using TXT or FASTA format files.                 For FASTA format files, if your files have incorrect or missing characters, it has to be                 fixed beforehand. For multiFASTA files, this aplication only reads the first sequence                 For TXT files, aplication will read every character inside the file, so after it has to                 erase the information not useful.
