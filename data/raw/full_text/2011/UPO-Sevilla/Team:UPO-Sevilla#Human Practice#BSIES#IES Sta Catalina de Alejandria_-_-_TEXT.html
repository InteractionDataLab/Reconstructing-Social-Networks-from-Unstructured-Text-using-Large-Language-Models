Would it be ethical to develop techniques for cloning human beings? (Juan Carlos Torres Montoro)
Techniques on their own are neither good nor bad, depends what you use them for. This procedures could be use to produce organs for transplants that would not elicit a rejection response, curing lots of diseases.  We think that governments should have a strict control and laws about this kind of experiments, not allowing the situations where the Human Rights may be violated.
Is it moral to use animals for experimentation? (José Montoro Ortiz)
Animals model are a way to study the molecular basis of a disease and see the effects of medicines. Without them, it would be almost impossible to find new therapies because nobody wants to try something that may kill or hurt badly another person. Also, they serve to study basic physiology and cellular function, by means inacceptable to use in humans. Animal experimentation is well regulated by government agencies, in charge of control the number of animals that are used and how they will be treated.
Are you for or against designed babies? (David Valentín Martín)
If it’s for curing diseases of elder brothers or to avoid an incurable illness, we think it’s up to the parents’ decision and it’s a rightful thing to do. Some other people want to have babies at their desire, choosing his/her sex and appearance.  We think that use this techniques should be used only when there are health issues involved.
