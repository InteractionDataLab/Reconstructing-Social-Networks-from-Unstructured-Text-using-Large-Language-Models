To storage information in computers, we use flip-flops, an electronic device that switches between two different states, called 0 and 1. The core of our project is the development of molecular systems that reproduce an electronic flip-flop, allowing the construction of living memory devices closer to the robustness of informatics.
This project’s idea comes from last year’s experience in the contest. Various iGEM teams have based their work on the construction of flip-flop biological systems, in previous editions of the competition. However, positive results have been more difficult to achieve than expected. UPO-Sevilla team considers the design, construction and improvement of this type of systems, encompassing different regulation levels (transcription, translation, protein proteolysis and epigenetic regulation) in different model organisms, from bacteria to yeast. We leverage our informatics knowledge to improve biological systems, so we can control precisely the cellular running.
In addition, we intend to develop a Foundational Advance for Synthetic Biology: the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a transposon-based system to integrate BioBricks into microbial genomes. And a Software tool: the BioBrick Creator, to facilitate the design of BioBrick standard sequences and their inclusion in the Parts’ Registry.
