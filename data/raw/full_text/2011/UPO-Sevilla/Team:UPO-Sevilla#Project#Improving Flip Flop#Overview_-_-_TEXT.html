Improving Flip Flop
Overview
Improved Flip Flop
This subteam, consisting of Víctor, Felix and Yolanda, tries to optimize the Basic bistable operation. The basic bistable has different weak points that we will try to solve by using a double proteolysis-sRNA (small antisense RNA) mechanism.
We basicly need to tackle two problems: Firstly, the tremendously long time that the bistable needs to switch from one state to the other and in second place minimize leakiness from one state to another.
We try implementing a proteolysis and an sRNA system, one for each part of our bistable, we will, at the same time, it will remove the reporter and the repressor genes quicker and more efficiently which we hope turns it into a more robust system. Detailed strategy it is explained in deep detail in the different sections of this wiki.
