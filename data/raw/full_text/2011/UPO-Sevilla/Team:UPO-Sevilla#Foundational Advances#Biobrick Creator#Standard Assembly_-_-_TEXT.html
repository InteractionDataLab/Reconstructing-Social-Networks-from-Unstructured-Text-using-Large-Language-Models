Standard Assembly
How does it work?
Prior to the BioBricks assembly, you must add all the BioBricks                 to the BioBrick Creator (to add a new BioBrick, create it and select it from                your computer). You can also upload more BioBricks previously created with                 this program. Once you have uploaded a BioBrick it will appear in the box below                 (these are the BioBricks available for assembly).
Application will only read TXT files that were created by Module I.                 TXT files from other applications may produced unexpected results, please fix them                 before use.
After selecting some BioBricks you will be able to build a customized list to make your new composite part based in BioBricks.
