Foundational Advances
Synthetic Biology is a promising field of science, but to make these promises real we need to continue improving it. The UPO-Sevilla team wants to contribute to the advance of SB with two new tools, one for the bench and another for in-silico design. The miniTn7 BioBrick tool kit will allow for first time the integration of BioBricks into microbial genomes, thus extending the use of Synthetic Biology to multiple bacterial strains other than E. coli and without the necessity of antibiotic selection. And the BioBrick Creator software tool will make easier to design and register parts, including other possibilities as computational assembly and codon optimization.
