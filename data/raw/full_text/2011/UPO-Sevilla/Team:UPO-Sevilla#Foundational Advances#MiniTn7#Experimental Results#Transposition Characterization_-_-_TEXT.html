Characterization of miniTn7BB-Gm function
In order to characterize the function of the miniTn7BB-Gm minitransposon, we performed a set of experiments aimed to (i) determine whether miniTn7BB-Gm can transpose efficientely in an enterobacterial host (E. coli DH5α) and a non-enterobacterial host (P. putida KT2440), (ii) measure the transposition frequency when miniTn7BB-Gm was delivered by elctroporation, chemical transformation and mating, (iii) determine whether insertion occurs site-specifically at the chromosomal attTn7 site, and (iv) determine whether flipase expression in trans can excise the drug resistance marker in the chromosomal copy of miniTn7BB-Gm.
Transposition of miniTn7BB-Gm in P. putida KT2440
In order to demonstrate miniTn7BB-Gm transposition into the P. putida KT2440 chromosome, pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm was transferred to this host by two different means: (i) co-electroporation with the helper plasmid pTNS2 [pTNS2 is not replicative in P. putida, but transiently produces the Tn7 transposition machinery ( Choi et al., 2005 )], and (ii) tetraparental mating, using DH5α/pUC18Sfi-miniTn7BB-Gm as the donor, DH5α/pRK2013 as helper to provide the Tra functions, DH5α/pTNS2 to provide the Tn7 transposase and P. putida KT2440 as the recipient. P. putida clones bearing minTn7BB-Gm insertions were selected on LB plates supplemented with Gm (and chloramphenicol when mating was used). Viable counts were also performed in both experiments, and plasmid transformation frequency was determined using the ampicillin/carbenicillin resistant replicative plasmid pBBR1mcs-5 in the electroporation experiment. The results are shown in Table 1.

The results clearly show that the gentamycin-resistance marker was acquired by P. putida KT2440 by both electrotransformation and conjugation, suggesting that the transposon was transferred to this non-enterobacterial recipient. In the electroporation experiment, the efficiency was low, with only 70 potential insertions per μg plasmid DNA, despite the fact that the strain had become very competent as shown by the high transformation efficiency achieved with a replicative plasmid. On the other hand, transposition frequency in the mating experiment was quite high, suggesting that conjugation may be a more efficient means to transfer the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon to P. putida. Similar results were obtained with the miniTn7BB-Gm transposon borne in the commercial plasmid pMA (Mr. Gene). Interestingly, conjugative transfer of pUC18 or pMA has not been described, and a transfer origin is not documented for any of these vectors. Similar frequencies and efficiencies have been obtained with other miniTn7 delivery plasmids, such as those of the pBK-miniTn7 series (Koch et al., 2001)(Fernando Govantes, personal communication)
Site-specificity of the miniTn7-Gm insertions in P. putida KT2440 obtained was determined by PCR amplification using a primer annealing at the 3' end of glmS and a primer annealing at the Tn7R end. The occurence of a 164 bp product indicates successful site-specific integration at attTn7, while absence of this product suggests non-specific insertion elsewhere. 12 candidates each from the electroporation and mating experiments were tested by colony PCR as indicated (Figure X). All candidates from the mating experiment and 10 out of 12 from the electroporation experiment displayed a band of the expected size, indicating that miniTn7BB-Gm efficiently inserts at the chromosomal attTn7 site of P. putida.
