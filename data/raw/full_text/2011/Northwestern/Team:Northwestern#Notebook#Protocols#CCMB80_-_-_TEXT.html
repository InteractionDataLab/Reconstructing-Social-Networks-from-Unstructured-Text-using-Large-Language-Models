CCMB80 Buffer
10 mM KOAc pH 7.0 (10 ml of a 1M stock/L)
80 mM CaCl2.2H2O (11.8 g/L)
20 mM MnCl2.4H2O (4.0 g/L)
10 mM MgCl2.6H2O (2.0 g/L)
10% glycerol (100 ml/L)
Adjust pH DOWN to 6.4 with 0.1N HCl if necessary
Adjusting pH up will precipitate manganese dioxide from Mn containing solutions.
Sterile filter and store at 4°C
Slight dark precipitate appears not to affect its function
