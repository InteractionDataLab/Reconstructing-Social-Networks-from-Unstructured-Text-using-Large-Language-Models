  Week 11
Day 54 - Monday, August 29nd 2011
We decided that our results were looking good, but we needed more replicated of each sample and wanted to test a wider range of autoinducer concentrations. So, we ran a 384 well plate that allowed us to just that.
We also ran for a longer time (4 hours) to try and see if a sigmoidal flourescence curve developed.
Began fitting our experimental data into mathematical model
Day 55 - Tuesday, August 30th 2011
Continued pouring over all of the data we've acquired so far.
Began to prepare testing samples for sequencing
Began overnights so that we could start testing with our RFP samples.
Day 56 - Wednesday, August 31st 2011
Ran another experiment, this time inducing our RFP constructs on a 384 well plate at an OD of around 0.5. Once again, we let the plate run in the High Throughput plate reader for four hours.
Made more M9 (Testing uses a lot of M9!)
Decided on questions for Professor Dale Mortenson, a nobel laureate in economics who will be one of the people we interview in our human practices video.
Planned strategy for getting all of our DNA into a Chlor backbone to submit.
Day 57 - Thursday, September 1st 2011
The RFP testing did not go nearly as well as the GFP. Even some of our controls were incorrect. We are going to run the test again to try and determine the source of error.
One problem may be that the High-Throughput auto-pipetter did not completely transfer the autoinducer samples.
Met with the advisors to discuss the progress of testing
Day 58 - Friday, September 2nd 2011
This is our last full day in lab together as a team! However, we will continue coming in over the next several weeks to finish up our testing, data analysis and human practices.
Organized the lab and cleaned up a lot
Ran another 384 well plate with RFP samples
Submitted our testing samples for sequencing
