Considerations
 Human Practices
For the Human Practices component of the iGEM competition, the Northwestern 2011 team has created a video to introduce Synthetic Biology to the community. Synthetic Biology is fairly new and many people are scared of the unknown consequences of the field. This attitude results from a long history of the public carrying a general mistrust of scientists. Synthetic Biologists are attempting to break this trend to show all that synbio has to offer.
Our iGEM project reaches out to the healthcare community in the hopes to improve the screening process for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the hospital setting. In this video, we explore how synbio's clinical applications can greatly contribute to the ever-changing medical field by not only the potential to improve quality of life, but also its prospective economic advantages.
This video is currently being displayed on television screens in the lobby of Northwestern’s Technological Institute, where it is available to all of students and faculty to see. It is also available on Youtube for the public viewing.
