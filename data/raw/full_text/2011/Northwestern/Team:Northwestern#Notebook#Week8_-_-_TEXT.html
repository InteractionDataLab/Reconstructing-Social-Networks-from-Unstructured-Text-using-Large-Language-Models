  Week 8
Day 34 - Monday, August 1st 2011
Miniprepped constitutive promoters, RBSs, and a 3 part ligation
Digested 2A (w/ PCR clean-up) and 3A for ligations of RBSs with parts
Ran gel of digested 3 part ligation
Transformed cells with ligated digestions
Found strep tag sequence? Fingers crossed. Worked on primers for adding tag to receptors.
Prepared samples for sequencing (lasP+RBS30+RFP, rhlP+RBS34+GFP)
Day 35 - Tuesday, August 2nd 2011
Made glycerol stock of constitutive promoter + RBS34 + rhlR
Digested, ligated, and transformed constitutive promoters and RBSs/parts
Finished primers for adding tag to receptors.
Prepared samples for sequencing.
PCRed a bunch of parts and 2L ligations; did ONs of backbones...we’re running out of DNA! =O
Received promoter oligos in mail!
Used up chlor plates for transformations so we made more plates (chlor and tet)
Plated ligations from glycerol stocks
Day 36 - Wednesday, August 3rd 2011
Miniprepped yesterday’s ONs
Made glycerol stock of CP2
Annealed CP oligos received in mail
Digested RBSs+parts and ligated with CP oligo
Most of yesterday’s transforms did not work - ONed transforms that did work
Day 37 - Thursday, August 4th 2011
Miniprepped, digested, and ran gels of RBS34+parts and RBS30+parts ligations
Miniprepped chlor backbone
Transformed oligo ligations
Plated RBS30+rhlR from glycerol stock
Plated TOP10 cells seedstock in preparation for making more competent cells
Day 38 - Friday, August 5th 2011
Made new sterile MgCl2
Made glycerol stocks of what worked on yesterday’s gel
Worked on our super awesome iGEM t-shirt design
