Abstract
My N.U. P.A.L
Northwestern University's Pseudomonas aeruginosa Locator
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in immunocompromised patients.  In addition to being the primary cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients, many severe nosocomial infections can be attributed to P. aeruginosa. Currently, the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. We have engineered an E. coli-based biosensor capable of detecting the presence of autoinducer molecules unique to P. aeruginosa. Thus, our system provides a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes. To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa. We have thus created a novel, inexpensive biosensor capable of detecting the presence of P. aeruginosa both quickly and effectively.
