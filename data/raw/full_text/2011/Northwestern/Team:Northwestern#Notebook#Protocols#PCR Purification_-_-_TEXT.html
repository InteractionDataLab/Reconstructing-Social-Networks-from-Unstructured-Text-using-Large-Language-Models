PCR Purification
We used QIAquick PCR Purification Kit from Qiagen. This can be used to purify PCR products or restriction digests.
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of PCR sample and mix. Apply sample to a spin column and centrifuge for 30-60 seconds. Discard flow-through. Place the column back into the same tube.
Wash with 0.75 mL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 30-60 seconds. Discard flow-through and place the column back into the same tube. Dry spin for an additional 1 minute at maximum speed.
Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 uL of nuclease free water to the center of the membrane. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes, then centrifuge teh column for one minute to elute.
