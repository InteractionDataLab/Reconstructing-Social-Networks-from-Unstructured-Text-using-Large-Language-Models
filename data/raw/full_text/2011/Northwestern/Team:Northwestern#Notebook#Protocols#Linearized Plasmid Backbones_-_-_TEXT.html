Linearized Plasmid Backbones
Short single stranded DNA fragments will not ligate to 4 bp overhangs.  By creating a very short overhang on a PCR of a plasmid backbone, the remnant, when cut with EcoRI and PstI is sufficiently short that it will not anneal at ligation temperature, and will therefore not ligate.  This allows us to build high quality construction plasmid backbone without purifying away the cut fragments remaining after PCR.
The prepared construction plasmids are given in the iGEM Distribution Kit as purified PCR products, diluted to standard concentration, but prior to cutting with EcoRI and PstI.  Standard assembly will cut this plasmid backbone with EcoRI and PstI at the same time that the two assembled fragments are cut with EcoRI and SpeI and with XbaI and PstI, respectively.
The preparation of this PCR fragment is done with primers having short overhangs past the EcoRI and PstI sites,  followed by PCR cleanup, dilution to standard concentration, and quality control testing.
Primers - Dilute to 30 pmol/ul

PCR
100 ul PCR supermix high fidelity
0.7 ul each primer
0.5 ul template DNA at 10 ng/ul    (Note: Do not use a sample of linearized plasmid backbones (PCRed) as a template)
Cycle 94/30s; 36x(94/30s;55/30s;68/3:00 min); 68/10 min
Ethanol precipitate (This step does not appear necessary)
Digest with DpnI enzyme in 100 ul 2 ul DpnI
Incubate 37/overnight hour; heat kill 80/20 min
Cleanup
Add 500 ul Qiagen buffer PB
Spin through a column twice, discard flowthrough
Wash 1x with 700 ul buffer PB
Wash 2x with 760 ul buffer PE
Discard liquid, spin dry at 17000g for 3 min
Elute into a new tube twice with 50 ul of TE (100 ul total)
Quality Control
Run 3 ul on a gel to verify the correct band and concentration and lack of side products
Quantify concentration on a nanodrop. Expect around 10 ug from a 100 ul PCR reaction (100 ng/ul in 100 ul)
Perform a ligation test
Test for both the EcoRI and PstI cutting and ligation efficiency
Digest in a 15 ul final volume
1 ul DNA (approximately 100 ng)
1.5 ul NEB Buffer 2
.15 ul BSA
0.5 ul either EcoRI-HF or PstI enzyme (not both!)
12 ul water
Digest 37/1 hour; 80/20 min
Add 5 ul of a 4x ligation master mix
Ligate 30 min at room temperature
Heat kill the ligase 80/20 min
Run all 20 ul on a gel
Compare intensity of the single and double length bands.  Good product should show mostly double length bands.
Ligation master mix
50 ul final
20 ul T4 DNA ligase buffer
5 ul T4 DNA ligase
25 ul water
Transformation test
Transform 1 ul of the diluted final product into highly competent cells
Control transform 10 pg of pUC19
Plate on the appropriate antibiotic
Observe few colonies.  Any colonies represent background to the three antibiotic assembly process
Quantify the effective amount of remaining circular DNA able to transform
Bulk Production
