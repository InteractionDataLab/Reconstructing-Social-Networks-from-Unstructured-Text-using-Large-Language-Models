  Week 11
Day 49 - Monday, August 22nd 2011
More extensive minipreps - this time of all the genomic promoter ligations.
Plated our glycerol stocks of the successful gels from friday to make sure everything worked properly.
Ran a plate of our controls at the high-throughput lab.
Digested and ran the genomic promoter ligations on a gel
Day 50 - Tuesday, August 23nd 2011
Analyzed the results from our control plate at the high throughput lab.
We wanted to continue testing, but we were having trouble getting all of our samples to grow properly.
Prepared 384 well plate layouts for future tests.
Day 51 - Wednesday, August 24nd 2011
The bacteria continued to have very weird growth patterns. We tried two other spectrophotometers to try and judge if ours was malfunctioning.
We eventually decided that our machine was okay, but that we had not been mixing the samples properly before reading them, which led to our weird results.
We made new M9 media in case that was causing the growth problems.
Day 52 - Thursday, August 25nd 2011
Ran a 96 well plate with our controls and GFP samples. We added the autoinducer to all of the samples at an OD of approximately 0.3
Began setting up interviews and a script for our human practices video
Day 53 - Friday, August 26nd 2011
Analyzed the results from our GFP test.
Continued working on human practices
