Favorite Parts
BBa_K575024 Main Page This construct consists of the gene for GFP, regulated by a promoter that is induced by the dimerization of lasR and 3-oxo-C12-HSL (a signaling molecule produced by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa), as well as a constitutively expressed gene for the lasR receptor protein. Cells transformed with this construct would ideally fluoresce green in the presence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL, thereby indicating the presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. We have shown that our cells do in fact fluoresce green if and only if autoinducer is present. The response was not highly dose-dependent. This means that the lasR receptor protein is successfully being produced and the promoter induced by the lasR/3-oxo-C12-HSL complex is working properly.
BBa_K575033 Main Page This construct consists of the gene for GFP, regulated by a promoter that is induced by the dimerization of rhlR and C4-HSL (a signaling molecule produced by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa), as well as a constitutively expressed gene for the rhlR receptor protein. Cells transformed with this construct would ideally fluoresce green in the presence of C4-HSL, thereby indicating the presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. We have shown that our cells do in fact fluoresce green if and only if autoinducer is present. The response is dose-dependent. This means that the rhlR receptor protein is successfully being produced and the promoter induced by the rhlR/C4-HSL complex is working properly.
BBa_K575046 Main Page This construct consists of the gene for GFP, regulated by a promoter (which we isolated from the Pseudomonas genome) that is induced by the dimerization of rhlR and C4-HSL (a signaling molecule produced by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa), as well as a constitutively expressed gene for the rhlR receptor protein. Cells transformed with this construct would ideally fluoresce green in the presence of C4-HSL, thereby indicating the presence of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. We have shown that our cells do in fact fluoresce green if and only if autoinducer is present. The response is also dose-dependent. This means that the rhlR receptor protein is successfully being produced and this newly-isolated promoter induced by the rhlR/C4-HSL complex is working properly.
