PCR Amplification
We used Phusion High Fidelity PCR Master Mix from New England Biolabs.
Assemble all reaction components on ice and quickly transfer the reactions to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98 degrees C). All components should be mixed and centrifuged prior to use. It is important to add Phusion Master Mix last in order to prevent any primer degredation. For 50 uL reaction:
10 uM forward primer
2.5 uL
10 uM reverse primer
2.5 μL
Template DNA
1 uL
Nuclease-free water
To final volume (including mix) of 50 μL
2X Phusion Master Mix
25 μL
Transfer PCR tubes from ice to a PCR machine with the block preheated to 98 degrees C and begin thermocycling. Thermocycing conditions for a routine PCR:
Initial denaturation
98 degrees C
30 seconds
25-35 cycles
98 degrees C
5-10 seconds
45-72 degrees C
10-30 seconds
72 degrees C
15-30 seconds
Final extension
72 degrees C
5-10 minutes
Hold
3 degrees C
