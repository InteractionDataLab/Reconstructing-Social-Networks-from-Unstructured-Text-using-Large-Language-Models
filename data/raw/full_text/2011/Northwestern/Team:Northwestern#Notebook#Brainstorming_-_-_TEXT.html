Initial Stages
During recruiting for members of the 2011 team during winter quarter, interested students participated in weekly journal sessions in which they read articles regarding recent advancements in synthetic biology, as well as took part in brainstorming sessions. During spring quarter, newly recruited members participated in weekly "boot camp" sessions in which they learned cloning techniques such as transformations and miniprepping, as well as continued to brainstorm additional ideas. The following list of generated ideas was developed throughout this time.
Silk production
Atherosclerosis treatment- arterial plaque remover, substance removal from blood, thrombus-formation preventer
Toenail clipper
Light (opsin)
Tumor detection
Memory/music i/o
Bacterial circuit
miracle fruit
power medical devices
medical targeting
hair eating
transcription ceasing bacteria (better chassis?)
appetite control
acne prevention
skin moisturizer
air freshener-- done before? with the wintergreen and banana scented bacteria from MIT.
hold soil to prevent erosion
water treatment
chocolate-tasting bacteria-- not sure how feasible it would be to create a “food” product. I wouldn’t want to taste it to see if it worked...
asian carp killing bacteria
h2o trapping in ground
custom restriction enzyme
Salt transport
Membrane electro-polarity
Pesticide/Repellent
Scaffolding
bio-glue
Round 1
Halfway through spring quarter, the list of ideas was narrowed down and team members split into several groups to research and prepared Round 1 of presentations to their faculty advisers. Advisers provided feedback regarding the feasibility of each potential project.
Helen and Rafay
Bioadhesive
Night light
Light sensitive sensors
Michael and Valerie
Temperature sensitive salt release
Mosquito repellent
Amino acid detection system
Kristin and Nirmit
Fluorescent thermometer
Preventative blood clotting
Temperature regulation
Round 2
For Round 2 of presentations, team members decided on their favorite ideas from Round 1. Each team further researched one idea that they retained from Round 1, as well as came up with two new ideas for Round 2.
Helen and Rafay
Ecolights
Vitamin K production
Oxidation sensor as toxin barometer
Michael and Valerie
Bacterial ink
Detecting rotting wood
Amino acid detection
Nirmit and Kristin
Temperature regulation
Quorum sensing
Alcohol sensor
Round 3
Teams then narrowed their ideas one last time to one per pair for Round 3
Helen and Rafay - Bacterial thermometer
Michael and Valerie - Quorum sensing
Nirmit and Kristin - Ecolights
Final Choice
During the first week of summer research, team members continued to peruse literature and decided to build a quorum sensor as their final project goal.
