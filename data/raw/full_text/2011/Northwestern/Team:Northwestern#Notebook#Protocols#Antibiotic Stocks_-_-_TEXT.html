Ampicillin
Stocks & Usage
Stock Concentration - 50mg/ml in H2O
Aliquots - 100μl and 500μl
Working Concentration - 50μg/ml
Preparation of 80ml stock solution
Ampicillin is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  It is light sensitive.
Weigh 4g of ampicillin into a small weigh boat.
Add 80ml of milliQ to a 250ml bottle.
Add the ampicillin to the milliQ
Mix/vortex so all the ampicillin goes into solution.
Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
Store at -20C.
Store the small aliquots in the small box and the big aliquots in the larger box.
Kanamycin
Stocks & Usage
Stock Concentration - 10mg/ml in H2O
Aliquots - 200μl and 1ml
Working Concentration - 20μg/ml
Preparation of 80ml stock solution
Kanamycin is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  It is light sensitive.
Weigh 800mg of kanamycin into a small weigh boat.
Add 80ml of milliQ to a 250ml bottle.
Add the kanamycin to the milliQ
Mix/vortex so all the kanamycin goes into solution.
Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
Store at -20C.
Store the small aliquots in the small box and the big aliquots in the larger box.
Tetracycline
Stocks & Usage
Stock Concentration - 5mg/ml in 70% Ethanol
Aliquots - 200μl and 1ml
Working Concentration - 20μg/ml
Preparation of 80ml stock solution
Tetracycline is kept in the 4C fridge in 68-564D.  It is light sensitive.
Weigh 400mg of tetracyline HCL into a small weigh boat.
Dilute 95% Ethanol to 70% using milliQ water.
Adding 20ml of milliQ to 60ml of 95% ethanol gives 80ml of 71% ethanol.
Add 80ml of 70% Ethanol to a 250ml bottle.
Add the tetracycline HCL to the ethanol.
Mix/vortex vigorously so all the tetracycline goes into solution.
Filter sterilize the solution into a falcon tube using a 20ml syringe and a 200nm filter.
Aliquot into pcr tubes and 1.7ml eppendorfs.
Store at -20C and protect any unused stock solution from light.
Store the small aliquots in the small box and the big aliquots in the larger box.
Chloramphenicol
Stocks & Usage
Stock concentration - 34mg/ml in 100% Ethanol
Aliquots - 1ml
Working concentration = 25μ/ml (Stringent), 170μ/ml (relaxed)
Preparation of 80ml stock solution
Chloramphenicol is kept at room temperature. It is near our other chemicals
Weight 2.72g of chloramphenicol sulfate into a small weight boat.
Add 80ml 100% EtOH to the chloramphenicol
95% EtOH probably works just fine, but I haven't tried it.
Mix/vortex vigorously so all the chloramphenicol goes into solution.
Aliquot into 1.7ml eppendorfs.
N.B. There is no need to filter sterilize, as it is in EtOH.
Store at -20C.
