Overnight
Take 5mL LB and put in a round bottom 5mL tube.
If your antibiotic is 1000x (which it should be) add 5uL antibiotic to your tube. Make sure you add the right one!
Take a p200 tip and lightly touch a colony.
Eject the tip into the culture and put the cap on.
For a miniprep, grow overnight for 12-16 hours.
Left over overnight cultures (after miniprepping) can be used to make glycerol stocks .
