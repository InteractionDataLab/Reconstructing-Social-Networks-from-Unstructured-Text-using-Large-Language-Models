Molecular Biology Group
The molecular biology group was responsible for running gel electrophoresis to check the PCR group’s products. This involved learning how to make agarose gels and learning to use the equipment to run gels. We were also responsible for imaging the gels using a UV imaging machine.
Example Gel
We were responsible for cleaning the PCR product with a Sigma-Aldrich PCR clean up kit and checking the concentration of the PCR products using a nano-drop machine.
We also performed restriction digest reactions in order to obtain specific fragments for ligation. We would perform restriction digests overnight, clean up the product, run the product on a gel, extract our desired fragment and ligate them together.
