Biobrick Transformation in E. coli:
GC5 E. coli cells and SOC medium arrived
Began transformation of E. coli with Leu2 and Ura3 biobricks
Thawed 50 uL cells in ice bath
Added 10 uL sterile ddH2O into biobrick wells 11A and 11C in plate 3
Waited 5 minutes for DNA to resuspend
Transferred the 10 uL to microcentrifuge tubes
Added 20 uL cells to Ura3 tube, 20 uL cells to Leu2 tube, 10 uL cells to control tube
Added 2 uL biobrick DNA to respective tubes
Waited 30 minutes for cells to transform on ice
Heat shocked in water bath at 37 C for 45 seconds
Placed cells on ice for 2 minutes
Added 200 uL SOC medium into each tube (100 uL into control tube)
Put tubes in shaker at 37 C at 220 rpm for one hour

Ran a new digestion
30 uL DNA from PCR cleanup of genomic DNA
incubated at 37 C overnight
Assay Preparation:
Streak yeast strains, BC177 and BC178, each onto a separate petri dish with YPD
June 17
Tranformation:
Due to the presence of ampicillin on the plates, we expected no colonies on the control plates, but colonies should grow on the Leu2 and Ura3 plates because they should have antibiotic resistance against ampicillin, if the transformation succeeded. Colonies grew on all plates, even the negative controls; we assume it must have been caused by deficient or faulty amipicillin. Because of this, we cannot determine whether the transformation proceeded correctly or not.
We are performing a test of our amicillin stock as well as our new ampicillin stock.
Three culture tubes each with 4 mL of LB. One tube is a positive control (No AMP), one has 4 uL of our old AMP stock, and one has 4 uL of our new AMP stock.
Cells that do not contain a plasmid are placed in each culture tube.
Began shaking at 240rpm at 37 degrees Celsius at 10:30 am.
At 2:30 pm (4 hour incubation) the OD of the positive control was around .250 and both AMP cultures were still around zero.
CONCLUSION: Ampicillin stocks are viable. Perhaps the reason for the lawns on the negative control transformation plates were due to Ampicillin being added while the media was still too hot.
We will be making new plates with new ampicillin, following the same procedures as described before:
Made plates with LB agar
Added ~300 mL H2O to graduated cylinder
Added 12.5 g LB broth, 7.5 g Bacto Agar, and aforementioned water to Erlenmeyer flask
Stirred on hot plate to boiling
Added water until total volume was 500 mL

Waited for the solution to cool
Added 500 uL ampicillin to flask

ran a gel of the digestion
Did gel extraction of PCR product from 6/17
PCR Team:
Ran PCR on the four cassettes (Leu2, Ura3, KanMX4, and NatMX4) with the newly arrived primers. This is amplify the cassettes, add homology to the insertion site, and add a restriction site. Sigma's Protocol from June 17 was used. Leu2 and Ura3 were annealed at 50 degrees C while NatMX4 and KanMx4 were annealed at 55 degrees C.
June 21
Transformation:
The transformation procedure performed yesterday worked. The Leu2 and the Ura3 plates all had some colonies on them, while the control plates had none.
Today, we made cultures of the Leu2 and Ura3 colonies.
Added 5 mL LB and 5 uL ampicillin to two tubes each.
Using sterile technique, picked off a colony from one plate and added it to one tube. Did same for other.
Incubated overnight on shaker at 30 C.
PCR: We used the Sigma protocol with an annealing temperature of 58 degrees C on the sample plasmid DNA provided to us by Burt. This was in order for the gel team to practice ligation after cutting with an restriction site.
Gel:
ran gels of PCR product from 6/20
made new gels
350 mL TAE and 3 g agarose
ran gels of PCR product from 6/21
[ [1] ]
June 22
Transformation:
Today, we used a plasmid miniprep kit to extract the plasmids from the cultured cells
For each tube, we extracted 4000 uL (4 mL) cell solution and added 1000 uL each into an individual microcentrifuge tube (for a total of 8 tubes)
Centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 minute
Discarded supernatant
Added 50 uL resuspension solution containing RNAse A into each of the eight tubes
Vortexed to resuspend
Combined the eight tubes into two new microcentrifuge tubes (for Leu2 and Ura3)
Added 200 uL lysis buffer into both tubes and inverted to mix
Added 350 uL neutralization/binding buffer and inverted to mix
Centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 minutes
Inserted a binding column into a microcentrifuge tube and added 500 uL to the column

Transferred supernatant (lysate) into columns
Centrifuged 1 minute and discarded flow-through
Added 500 uL wash solution to column; centrifuged again and discarded flow-through
Added 750 uL second wash solution to column; centrifuged again and discarded flow-through
Centrifuged again and discarded flow-through to remove ethanol
Transferred to new collection tube
Added 100 uL elution solution and centrifuged again
We measured the DNA concentration of the resulting eluate using a Nanodrop.
Leu2: 329.8 ng/uL
Ura3: 84.1 ng/uL
PCR:
We repeated the PCR done on June 20th on the cassettes. The only difference is we added a sample with just plasmid DNA and no primers in order to determine if the top band on the gel resulting from the June 20th PCR was the plasmid DNA.
June 23
Transformation:
The Leu2 concentration was very high. To be sure, we measured the concentrations of both again.
Leu2: 323.9 ng/uL
260/280: 1.89
260/230: 2.33
Ura3: 83.4 ng/uL
260/280: 1.99
260/230: 2.23
We also began practicing transformation of yeast using two strains that Kim gave us and the pRS425 plasmid. To transform the yeast, we would have to extract the plasmid from the E. coli colonies we were given using a miniprep kit. We cultured the three plates.
For each plate, we chose one colony and added it to a glass tube of solution. For the two yeast strains, we used 5 mL YPD and 5 uL ampicillin. For the E. coli, the tube contained 5 mL LB only.
The three glass tubes went into a 30 C shaker overnight.
Assay:
Practiced using Olis spectrophotometer and computer program for future experiments involve spectrophotometrically assaying for the intermediates and products of the beta carotene pathway.
Repaired stock beta carotene solution and 1/128 stock beta carotene solution, both in acetone.
Took preliminary spectra of beta carotene solutions, starting from the stock solution, successively diluting by twofold each time.
Gel:ran a gel of the PCR product from 6/22
June 24
Transformation:
Due to a misunderstanding, our yeast cultures were accidentally dumped, so we could only work with the E. coli with pRS425 plasmid today.
Using the miniprep procedures previously described, we miniprepped one tube of the plasmid.
Nanodrop results:
Concentration: 235.4 ng/uL
260/280: 1.88
260/230: 2.30
PCR: Repeated the PCR from June 22 because we realized the concentration of DNA was too high. For this sample 10 ng of DNA were loaded for Leu2, Ura3, Kan, and Nat.
Assay:
Experimentally obtained the absorption spectrum of yeast solution in YPD and beta carotene dissolved in acetone at varying concentrations. Started with solutions of each and successively diluted solutions twofold until absorption peaks are no longer characteristic of the solution.
