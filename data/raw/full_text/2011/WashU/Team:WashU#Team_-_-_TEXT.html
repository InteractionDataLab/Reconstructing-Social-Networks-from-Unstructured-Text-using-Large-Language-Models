All wet lab procedures were performed by members of the WashU IGEM team. However, several people outside of the IGEM team helped contribute to our project.
Graduate student Robert Zeigler from the Cohen Lab designed the PGK Promoter sequence that we used in our expression constructs.
Graduate student Kim Lorenz from the Cohen Lab instructed us in the correct techniques for yeast transformations.
Graduate student Bert Berla from the Pakrasi Lab instructed us in designing PCR primers.
Professors Joe Jez and Barak Cohen helped in an advisory capacity as we designed and carried out our experimental plan.
Undergraduates Brian Landry and Brenden McDearmon helped in an advisory capacity as we designed and carried out our experimental plan.
