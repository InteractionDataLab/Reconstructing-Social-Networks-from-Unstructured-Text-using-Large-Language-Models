BBa_K516210
BBa_K516210 (pTet-RBS30-LuxI) - HSL synthesis device, aTc inducible.
This is one of four systems with different RBSs (output modulation) tested to quantify the produced HSL. The results obtained by testing this part allowed the identification of important model parameters to predict the behavior of the whole CTRL+E circuit.

BBa_K516334
BBa_K516334 (pLambda-RBS30-LuxR-T-pLux-RBS34-mRFP-TT) - 3OC6-HSL biosensor, mRFP output.
This is one of the four biosensors (different RBSs) built and characterized. This measurement system senses the HSL concentration in the medium and responds with an RFP output. Several RBSs have been used to modulate the output range. This is a simple measurement system, used to identify important model parameters used to simulate the behavior of the whole circuit.

BBa_K081022
Experience page of BBa_K081022 Plambda regulated luxR generator and Plux.
This device has been characterized with several RBSs in order to modulate the output range. In this way, this device can be used to tightly control the expression of downstream encoded protein from a very weak production (using weak RBS) to a very intensive production (with strong RBSs).
