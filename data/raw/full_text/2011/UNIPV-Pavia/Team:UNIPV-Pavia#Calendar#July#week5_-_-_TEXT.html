Inoculum of E17-2, E18-2, E19-2 or E20-2 to amplify DNA and transfer it into MGZ1; refill for E36 liquid culture.
Glycerol stock for E36 was prepared
250 ml of LB + Cm 12.5 were prepared.

July, 27th
E37, E38, E39, E40, E41, E42, E17, E18, E19 and E20 were transformed in 100 μl of MGZ1 competent cells according to protocols. Moreover 4ng of purified BBa_B0032 DNA were transformed in MGZ1 in order to test the transformation efficiency. Plates were incubated ON at 37°C.
BMR Genomics sent results of parts sequencing; E17-2, E18-2, E31-1, E32-2, E33-2, E34-1, E35-2 were OK while E28-1 sequence was wrong.

July, 28th
Colonies grew in every plate. In fact E17-2, E18-2, E19-2 and E20-2, E37, E38, E39 and E40 showed grown colonies. We picked two colonies for each plate and inoculate them in 5 ml of LB + Cm 12.5. As regards to E41 and E42 parts, we resolved to let them still grow; in the late morning we picked and inoculate two colonies for both plates.
Plate with BBa_B0032 showed 9 colonies; the corresponding efficiency results in 2250 colonies/μg of DNA (very low, we need to prepare new competent MGZ1).

July, 29th
Glycerol stocks were prepared for E17-2, E18-2, E19-2, E20-2 in MGZ1.
Plasmid purification was carried out on over-night grown cultures (E41-1 did not grow!):

For each digestion 10 μl of purified DNA were used. Meanwhile a medium size gel was prepared.
In the afternoon gel electrophoresis was carried out:

All clones were positive except for E42-2 and E41-2.
Glycerol stocks were prepared for E37-2, E38-1, E39-1, E40-2 and E42-1.
Ligations of consitutive promoter BBa_J23101 with different RBS in pSB4C5 were performed:

E28 and E41 were again transformed in 200 μl of MGZ1 competent cells.
J101-E5, J101-31 and J101-E7 ligations were transformed in 100 μl of TOP10 competent cells.

July, 31st
All plates showed colonies. One colony was picked from each of J101-E5, J101-31 and J101-E7 plates, inoculated in LB + Cm 12.5 and grown.
