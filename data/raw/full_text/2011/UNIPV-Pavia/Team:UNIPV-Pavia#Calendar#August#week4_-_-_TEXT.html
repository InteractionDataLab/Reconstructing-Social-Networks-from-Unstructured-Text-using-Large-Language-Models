AUGUST: WEEK 4
August, 22nd
Streak of E17-2, E18-2, J101-31, J101-E5 and ENTERO-4C5 on LB agar + Cm12.5 plate to test Plux promoter with different RBSs.
E24-1, E25-2, E26-1, E27-2 and E41N-1 purified DNA samples were sent to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
250 ml of M9 glycerol supplemented minimal medium were prepared.
Inoculum of T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS to test supernatants collected on August, 19th to test AiiA enzyme efficiency.
^top
August, 23rd
T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS were diluted 1:500 in a final volume of 13 ml and 1 ml respectively of M9 + Amp + Cm12.5.
Three colonies of E17-2, E18-2, J101-31, J101-E5 and ENTERO-4C5 were picked and inoculated in 1 ml of M9 + Cm12.5.
E19-2, E 20-2, J101-E7, J101-4C5 and ENTEOR-4C5 were streaked on a LB agar + Cm12.5 plate.
Unfortunately TECAN test could not be performed as the instrument did not work!
31 LB agar + Cm34 plates were prepared.
Last week sequencing were ready: E28-1 has not the desired sequence, while E37-2, E38-1, E39-1, E40-2 and E42-1 were correct.
Ptet-RBS30-luxI ligation was done again from E36 and E2:

E43 ligation was transformed in 100 μl of MGZ1 competent cells.
E20-2 were streaked again.
E17-2, E18-2, J101-31, J101-E5 and ENTERO-4C5 were diluted 1:500 in 1 ml of M9 + Cm12.5; after three hours growth E17 and E18 cultures were induced with final concentrations of 3OC

-HSL of: 0 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM and 100 nM. After three hours 200 μl of every culture were aliquoted in TECAN microplate (this time TECAN  Infinite F200 worked!).
Three colonies of E19-2, E 20-2, J101-E7, J101-4C5 and ENTEOR-4C5 were inoculated in 1 ml of M9 + Cm12.5
E2-2, E3-1, E4-2, E5-2, E6-1, E7-2, E9-2, E10-1, E11-2 were inoculated in 5 ml of LB + Amp while E36, J101-E5, J101-31 and J101-E7 were inoculated in 5 ml of LB + Cm12.5; these cultures were grown in order to purify plasmids and transfer parts in pSB1C3 standard shipping plasmid.

Every plasmid was digested with EcoRI and PstI resctriction endonucleases. A medium size and a small size agarose-gel were prepared and, after three hours digestion, gel-electrophoresis was carried out:
Medium size gel
Small size gel
As showed in images E36 did not show the correct insert band while J101-31, J101-E5 and J101-E7 showed light intensity bands as they were in a low copy number plasmid. The correct parts were gel-extracted and DNA was quantified:

BBa_R0040 in J61002 was inoculated in 5 ml LB + Amp while J101-31, J101-E5 and J101-E7 were again inoculated in 8 ml of LB + Cm12.5 for plasmid purification.
Glycerol stocks were prepared for E43-1 and E43-2 while E43-3 was grown ON; these tubes were refilled with LB + Cm12.5 in order to have a final volume of 8 ml, to increase plasmid purification efficiency.
T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS were inoculated in 1 ml of M9 + Amp + Cm12.5 to test the supernatants collected on August, 19th and test AiiA enzyme efficiency.

Glycerol stock for E43-3 was prepared according to protocols.
T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS were diluted in a final volume of 13 ml and 1 ml of M9 + Amp + Cm12.5. After growing them for 6 hours, a test was performed, measuring 3OC

A medium size agarose-gel was prepared. BBa_R0040 in J61002 resulted incorrect, while other bands had a light intensity but we decided however to gel-extract and ligate them:

E24-2, E25-1, E26-2, E27-2 and RBS32 were inoculated in 1 ml of M9 + Amp to test AiiA efficiency in high copy number plasmids, taking cultures supernatants with a protocol similar to the one used for low copy number vectors.

August, 27th
E24-2, E25-1, E26-2, E27-2 and RBS32 were diluted 1:500 in a final volume of 6 ml of M9 + Amp; a tube with 6 ml of M9 + Amp medium was also prepared. These six tubes were grown for 2 hours; then 3OC

-HSL was added at a final concentration of 100 nM. Supernatants were taken at the moment of supplementation (t = 0 h), after 1 hour, after 2 hours and after 4 hours; then they were stored at -20°C.
E2-1C3, E3-1C3, E4-1C3, E5-1C3, E6-1C3, E7-1C3, E9-1C3, E10-1C3, E11-1C3, J101-31-1C3, J101-E5-1C3 and J101-E7-1C3 were transformed in 100 μl of TOP10 competent cells; plates were grown for 2 days at about 28°C.
E43-3 was again plasmid purified to screen its length (11.4 ng/μl).
