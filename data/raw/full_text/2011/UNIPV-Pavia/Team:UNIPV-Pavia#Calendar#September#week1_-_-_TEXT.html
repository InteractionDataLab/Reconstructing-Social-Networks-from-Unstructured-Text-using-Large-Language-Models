SEPTEMBER: WEEK 1
September, 2nd
E3-1C3-2 was purified in order to screen the part length.
Plasmid
DNA (ng/μl)
E2-1C3-2
82.1
R0040 in J61002-1C3, E3N-1C3 and J101-31N-1C3 were transformed in 200 μl of TOP10 competent cells.
Inoculum of E24-2, E25-1, E26-2, E27-2 and RBS32 in M9 + Amp to collect supernatant after 3OC
6
-HSL supplementation.
Inoculum in M9 + Cm12.5 of T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS to measure 3OC
6
-HSL concentration in supernatants at different pHs collected on August, 31st .

September, 3rd
All the cultures were diluted 1:200 in M9 with the proper antibiotic. After two hours T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS were aliquoted in 96-well microplate and induced with known concentrations of 3OC
6
-HSL and with the supernatants collected on August, 31st .
E24-2, E25-1, E26-2, E27-2, RBS32 and sterile M9 were supplemented with 100 nM 3OC
6
-HSL. Supernatants were collected at t = 0 h, t = 7 h and t = 24 h from all of these tubes.
R0040 in J61002-1C3 and J101-31N-1C3 showed colonies while E3N-1C3 did not grow; two colonies were picked for each plate and inoculated in Lb + Cm34, 5 ml.
2 μl of the purified plasmidic DNA of E3-1C3-2 were digested with 0.5 μl EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes in a 25 μl final volume; a small size agarose gel was prepared.
Small size gel
The sample did not show the correct band.
500 ml M9 and 1 l LB were prepared.

September, 4th
R0040 in J61002-1C3-1, R0040 in J61002-1C3-2, J101-31-1C3-1 and J101-31-1C3-2 were glycerol stocked and then plasmidic DNA was purified with MiniPrep commercial kit:
Plasmid
DNA (ng/μl)
R0040 in J61002-1C3-1
66.2
R0040 in J61002-1C3-2
81.4
J101-31-1C3-1
86.9
J101-31-1C3-2
98.3
2.5 μl of each sample were digested with 0.5 μl EcoRI and PstI resctriction endonucleases in a 25 μl final volume. A small size agarose gel was prepared. In the afternoon electrophoresis was carried out; all samples showed the correct insert.
Small size gel
Inoculum of T9002-ENTERO and ENTERO-RBS to measure 3OC
6
-HSL concentration in supernatants collected on August, 31st .
Inoculum of E31-1, E41N-1, E42-1, E43-2, E43-3 and ENTERO-4C5 to collect the supernatants and measure the 3OC
6
-HSL produced by luxI enzyme.
