AUGUST: WEEK 5
August, 29th
T9002-ENTERo and ENTERO-RBS were diluted 1:500 in M9 + Amp + Cm12.5 13 ml and 1 ml volume respectively. After six hour growth they were aliquoted in 96-well microplate (190 μl cultures) with 10 μl of supernatants collected on August, 27th and 10 μl of 3OC
6
-HSL.
5 flasks were prepared with 29.6 ml H
2
O, 200 μl glycerol 80 %, 8 ml M9 salts 5 x and their pH was adjusted to 5.9, 6.3, 6.7, 6.9 and 7.2; they were autoclaved in order to prepare M9 glycerol supplemented minimal medium.
E43-3 DNA was digested with EcorI and PstI restriction nucleases in order to screen the part length by gel-electrophoresis; it showed the correct band.
Small size gel
Plates incubated on August, 27th were all grown, except for J101-31-1C3; for each of them a colony was picked and inoculated in LB + Cm34, 5 ml, while for J101-E7 two colonies were inoculated in LB + Cm34, 5 ml.
E43-2 was again inoculated in order to screen the insert length with gel electrophoresis.

August, 30th
Glycerol stocks were prepared for E2-1C3, E3-1C3, E4-1C3, E5-1C3, E6-1C3, E7-1C3, E9-1C3, E10-1C3, E11-1C3, J101-E5-1C3, J101-E7-1C3-1 and J101-E7-1C3-2.

All parts showed the correct insert length except for E3-1C3. We decided to pick and inoculate another colony from the plate, named E3-1C3-2.
40 μl CaCl

1M and 1.36 ml thiamine were added to previously autoclaved flasks to prepare M9 at different pHs.
Inoculum of BBa_R0040 in J61002, E3-1 in 5 ml LB + Amp and J101-31 in 8 ml LB + Cm12.5.
Inoculum of ENTERO-4C5 in different pH M9 to test 3OC

August, 31st
E2-1C3, E4-1C3, E5-1C3, E6-1C3, E7-1C3, E9-1C3, E10-1C3, E11-1C3, J101-E5-1C3, J101-E7-1C3-1, E43-2 and E43-3 DNA samples were prepared and sent to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
ENTERO-4C5 cutlures were diulted 1:200 in a final volume of 5 ml M9. After 2 hours 3OC

-HSL was added to a final concentration of 100 nM and the first supernatant sample was collected. After 1 hour, 4 hours and 22 hours from 3OC

-HSL supplementation samples were again collected; supernatants were all stored at -20°C in order to measure 3OC
6
-HSL concentration with BBa_T9002 biosensor.
BBa_R0040 in J61002, E3-1 and J101-31 were extracted with MiniPrep kit; here are their quantifications:
