Data analysis
Data pre-processing
Data from TECAN Infinite F200 need to be pre-processed in order to remove spurious effects affecting measurements. Before evaluating the parameters of interest (for example the synthesis rate per cell, S
cell
, or Relative Promoter Unit, R.P.U.) blanking is needed:
the reference value (i.e. the measure of O.D. at 600 nm of the broth in which cultures grow) was subtracted from each sample of O.D. at 600 nm, (O.D.
600
)
the reference value (i.e. the red or green fluorescence of a non-fluorescent culture, also known as auto-fluorescence) was also subtracted from each sample of red and green fluorescence
^top
Doubling time evaluation
After blanking O.D.
600
data you can compute the doubling time of cultures growth, i.e. the time needed to double O.D.
600
.
Identifying the exponential phase of growth curve can be done by visual inspection, plotting the natural logarithm of O.D.
600
over time. Linear regression on logarithmic data is performed to estimate the growth rate, named μ. Finally doubling time can be evaluated as:
When measuring multiple growth for a strain this value was evaluated for each reaplicate and then average was computed.
^top
Synthesis rate per cell (S
cell
) evaluation
Another interesting parameter, which describes the activity of a promoter of interest (φ), is the S
cell
; it needs to be measured using reporter genes as RFP or GFP.
Compute the average of the time derivative of the red or green fluorescence, divided by the O.D.
600
, in the time interval corresponding to the exponential growth phase which boundaries can be identified by visual inspection of the logarithmic growth curve:
The S
cell
is basic to measure the Relative Promoter Unit, a robust parameter expressing the transcriptional activity of a promoter.
^top
R.P.U. evaluation
As described in Kelly J. et al., 2009, Relative Promoter Units express the activity of a promoter of interest (φ), reported to the one of a reference promoter, BBa_J23101 (from Anderson promoters collection). The R.P.U. of a promoter is expressed as the ratio between its S
cell
and the one of BBa_J23101 :
This procedure has the advantage of being robust to variations in experimental conditions (for example the instrument used to measure absorbance and fluorescence) and proportional to PoPS (Polymerase Per Second) if the subsequent specifications are satisfied:
strain, plasmid copy number, antibiotic, growth medium, growth conditions, protein generator assembled downstream of the promoter must be the same in the promoter of interest and in BBa_J23101 reference standard
the reporter protein must have a half life higher than the experiment duration Moreover the S
cell
signal of both the promoter of interest and of BBa_J23101 has to be constant on the time interval considered for R.P.U. evaluation.

-HSL concentration
The procedure described below is useful in order to quantify the concentration of 3OC
6
-HSL in cultures expressing LuxI and AiiA enzyme.
Once collected (according to the protocol above ) and pre-processed data, it is necessary to compute the S
cell
of every culture.
BBa_T9002 induced with known 3OC

-HSL concentrations is useful to estimate the parameters of the activation Hill function of pLux promoter. In this way, for each of our tests, we were able to build a calibration curve for the biosensor:
Provided that the S
cell
measured for BBa_T9002 induced with supernatants of cultures producing or degrading 3OC
6
-HSL has a value included in the linear zone of the biosensor (tuning of the dilution factor is necessary), you can easily evaluate the auto-inducer concentration as follows:
Finally, don't forget to multiply the value obtained for the dilution factor (in our experiments it was 20).
