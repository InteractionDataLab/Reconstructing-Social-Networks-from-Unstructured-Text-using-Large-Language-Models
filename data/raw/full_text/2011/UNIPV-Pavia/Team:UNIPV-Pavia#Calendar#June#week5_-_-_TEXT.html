JUNE: WEEK 5
June, 28th
First time in wet lab
11 LB agar plates, 35 LB agar + Amp plates and 15 LB agar + Cm 12.5 were prepared.
BBa_C0060 was resuspended from iGEM 2011 kit distribution, Plate 1, well 4K in 15 μl of ddH
2
O
BBa_C0061 was resuspended from iGEM 2011 kit distribution, Plate 1, well 4M in 15 μl of ddH
2
O
BBa_J04450 was resuspended from iGEM 2011 kit distribution, Plate 1, well 5E in 15 μl of ddH
2
O
BBa_K081022 was resuspended from iGEM 2011 kit distribution, Plate 2, well 12N in 15 μl of ddH
2
O
For each of them 1 μl was transformed in 100 μl of home-made TOP10 competent cells. Transformants were plated on LB agar plates with the right antibiotic and incubated ON at 37°C.

June, 29th
In the morning all plates showed colonies ( BBa_J04450 showed light red colonies); for each we picked one colony and inoculated it in 1 ml of liquid LB with the proper antibiotic (ampicillin for BBa_C0060 , BBa_C0061 and BBa_K081022 , kanamycin for BBa_J04450 ). Cultures were grown at 37°C, 220 rpm.
In the afternoon glycerol stocks were prepared (750 μl of cultures and 250 μl of 80% glycerol) and stored at -80°C except for BBa_C0061 which was not sufficiently grown (we let it grow until next morning); then cultures were refilled with 5 ml of liquid LB with the proper antibiotic and incubated ON at 37°C, 220 rpm.

June, 30th
All cultures were in saturation growth phase; glycerol stock for BBa_C0061
Plasmids were extracted with MiniPrep kit; purified DNA was quantified with NanoDrop Spectrophotometer:
