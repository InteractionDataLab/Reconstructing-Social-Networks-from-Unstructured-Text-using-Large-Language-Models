What we did...
Edoardo Baldini has been the wiki-master. He took care of the wiki design and layout very meticulously. Despite being an electronic engineer, he also learnt and carried out all the wet lab protocols, cloning parts with success and performing Tecan tests. During the brainstorming sessions of March and April he proposed a couple of interesting ideas. Finally he worked on our terrific sweaters!
Giuseppe Bertoni has been fundamental during the brainstorming sessions, thanks to his enormous knowledge and passion in biology and biotechnology. He also worked on cloning BioBrick parts and on the design and performing of Tecan experiments. He also worked on the wiki, designing our fantastic logo.
Davide Bianchini has been working hard on the model, deriving its equations and designing the Tecan tests for the parameter estimation. His work on the stability analysis was also very important; moreover he also helped in the wet lab, working on the cloning of BioBrick parts and their transferring in pSB1C3 shipping plasmid.
Niccolò Franceschi has worked hard in the wet lab, both on the cloning and the testing of our BioBrick parts, verifying, together with Viola that all of our parts were correct. He also analyzed the scientific literature and actively worked on resuming the results of our tests. Least but not last, was fundamental in raising funds for our project.
Viola Ghio worked hard in the wet lab. She cloned parts, performed screening on them and also verified that their sequences were correct. Moreover she worked on the transferring of selected BioBrick parts in pSB1C3 shipping vector. She actively took part in wiki editing and also took photographs for the Gallery and Team pages.
Tommaso Goggia, one of the biomedical engineers of our group, worked very hard on all the activities, learning to perform all the wet lab protocols, designing and performing Tecan tests. Together with Davide he derived the model equations and carried out a precise data analysis for the quantitative characterization of our BioBrick parts and the identification of mathematical model parameters.
Emanuela Pasi gave contribution in the wet lab, following all the Tecan tests and the BioBrick parts cloning. She was also involved in the analysis of the scientific literature connected with our project; freezer management was also one of her works. Finally she played an important role in the design of our poster and presentations.
Daniele Sartori was the chemist specialist of the group, who worked on all the wet lab activities; he helped us understanding the behavior of HSL at different pHs. His support in cloning and transferring BioBrick parts in pSB1C3 was fundamental; he also designed the poster and the presentation together with Emanuela and decided which results to put in it.
Nicolò Politi planned and coordinated all the student and advisor activities in both wetlab and drylab and trained the students for the cloning and quantitative experiments. Instructor for the rest of the team about promoter measurement, modeling and data analysis.
Federica Sampietro coordinated all the wet lab work. She played an important role in cloning all the parts and characterizing them, as she worked also on the data analysis and quantitative characterization. During the brainstorming meetings she analyzed all the ideas and collected a lot of information on the previous iGEM editions projects. She also took care of the freezer management together with Emanuela.
Susanna Zucca coordinated the team during the brainstorming sessions, project discussions and during the submission and documentation of BioBrick parts to the Registry.  Instructor for the rest of the team about physical and functional standardization in synthetic biology.
Maria Gabriella Cusella is the leader of the wetlab in which the students worked during the summer. She organized the spaces, the instruments and the lab funds dedicated to the   iGEM project.
Paolo Magni coordinated all the project activities: meetings, project timeline, fundraising, contacts with media and institutions. Registry, wiki, poster and presentation   supervisor (with the other advisors). He also performed the selection of the team students and he participated (with the other adivsors) to the selection and the definition of the project   and to all the discussions about its problems and issues.
All team members contributed equally to brainstorming sessions,
BioBrick parts selection and project documentation.
