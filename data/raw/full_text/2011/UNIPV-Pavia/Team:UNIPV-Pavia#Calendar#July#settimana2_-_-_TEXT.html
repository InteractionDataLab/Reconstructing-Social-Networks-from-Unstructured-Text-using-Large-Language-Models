Reactions were incubated at 37°C for three hours while a small-size and a medium-size agarose gel were prepared according to protocols.
In the afternoon gel electrophoresis was performed.
Small size gel
Medium size gel
As shown, in figure all clones were positive (apart from BBa_I13501 run where we inexplicably didn't see any band), so we cut and purified the bands of interest. Cells harbouring BBa_I13501 were again inoculated in 5 ml LB + Amp.
After gel extraction, digested DNA was quantified:

O; BBa_C0261 , E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7, and E8 were transformed in 100 μl of TOP10 competent cells according to protocols. Plates were incubated ON at 37°C.
500 ml of LB without antibiotic were prepared.

July, 7th
All plates showed a lot of colonies, except for E-8 (5 colonies); two colonies for E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, E7 plates and three colonies for E8 plate were picked and inoculated in 10 μl LB for inoculum and screening PCR.

24 μl were aliquoted in each tube, together with 1 μl of each liquid culture. PCR cycles parameters were set as follows:
94°C 30 seconds (denaturing)
60°C 1 minute (annealing)
72°C 1 minute and 20 seconds (elongation)
35 cycles were performed.
Liquid cultures were then inoculated in 800 μl LB with the proper antibiotic.
A small size and a medium size agarose gel were prepared.
After the PCR, gel run was carried out on the samples:
Medium size gel
Small size gel
Except for E2-1, E4-1 and E7-1, other band lengths were correct; 750 μl of E1-2, E2-2, E3-1, E4-2, E5-2, E6-1, E7-2, E8-3 and BBa_C0261 liquid cultures were used to prepare glycerol stocks while the remaining 50 μl were refilled to 5 ml for plasmid purification and incubated at 37°C 220 rpm. BBa_R0040 , BBa_C0261 and BBa_I13521 were also inoculated.
In the late afternoon the team met to talk about the wet-lab activity, the abstract and the bio-safety section.
