Collaboration
University of Glasgow iGEM Team
A special thank you to the Glasgow 2011 iGEM team , who provided us with 5 μL PSB1C3 (Biobrick backbone), so we could PCR some more ourselves!
University of Dundee iGEM Team
Dundee 2011 iGEM team kindly allowed us the use of their labs, time and resources. This was crucial in the completion of our project, especially towards the end.
Also a special thank you to Richard Owen, whose help and work in the lab was of vital importance in the troubleshooting and ligation of our biobrick to the PSB1C3 backbone.
