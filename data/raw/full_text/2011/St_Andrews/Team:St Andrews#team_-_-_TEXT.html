Students
Lamya Kamal
School of Medicine
Lamya is a first year student who just completed the International Foundation Programme for Medicine and will be starting Medicine in September. She is a part of the lab and human practices teams and she also helps out with contacting potential sponsors and making travel arrangements. This is her first time at iGEM and she hopes to learn a lot this summer.
Max Nicosia
School of Computer Science
Max is going into his 4th year of computer scientist, hoping to specialise in network theory and probably go on to do some further studies. When he is not coding, he enjoys being out, doing exercise and various outdoor activities.
Sam Lipworth
School of Medicine
Sam is going into his third year of pre-clinical medicine and is the teams resident student who knows a little but not a lot about most things.  He helped out on the wiki at the very beggining, does some lab work and is also doing work on two of the human practives projects.  Sam has previous research experience with the Asthma and Allergy Research Group in Dundee where his research interest is the use/effect of Beta-Blockers in COPD patients and with whom he has published two peer-reviewed research papers.  In his spare time (well, actually most of the time...) Sam is involved with all manner of musical activity.
Ogaga Sim-Ifere
School of Medicine
Ogaga is a second year medicine student. She is quite varied and works on the survey part of the human practises as well as in the lab. She's very excited about iGEM and is glad to be a part of this new and interesting field.
Charlie Thompson
School of Biology
Charlie is studying for a Cellular Biology degree and is heading into his 3rd academic year.  He's the token and only biologist on the St Andrews iGEM team, which leaves him responsible for much of the laboratory planning and biological guidance for the project.  When Charlie is out of the lab, he can be found on his computer ordering primers, designing experiments, and playing music which no one else seems to appreciate...
Christina Samson
School of Mathematics
Christina is entering her fourth and final year of mathematics, specialising in applied mathematics. She is the modeller in the team but has also diversified into finding sponsorship deals. Having had a limited knowledge of biology, she is on a steep learning curve and has acquired a great deal of knowledge about biological systems!
Supervisors
Dr. V Anne Smith
School of Biology
Anne's research is in the field of computational biology. She examines complex biological networks, developing and evaluating algorithms to infer functional interactions based upon observational data. She works many levels of biological organisation, concentrating on networks in molecular, neuronal, and ecological systems. Her current research concentrates on the use of Bayesian networks to infer interactions in these biological systems.
Dr. Chris Hooley
School of Physics & Astronomy
Chris is a theoretical condensed matter physicist working at the University of St Andrews
Dr. John Mitchell
School of Biomolecular Sciences
John is interested in anything computational and related to molecules. After a PhD in theoretical chemistry, his first postdoc was in Biochemistry at UCL. He has been a lecturer at Birkbeck and at Cambridge, before coming to St Andrews in 2009. Since then, he has done lots of chemoinformatics, quite a lot of bioinformatics and only a little real theoretical chemistry. His scientific interests include computing the binding affinities between proteins and ligands, side-effects and toxicities of pharmaceuticals, and how much of a compound will dissolve in water. His group have worked extensively on the prediction of molecular properties such as melting point and solubility from chemical structure. They also use computational methods to study enzyme reaction mechanisms. They continue to develop the MACiE database of enzyme reaction mechanisms in collaboration with Prof. Janet Thornton at the EMBL-EBI.
Dr. Morven Shearer
School of Medicine
Morven is particularly interested in the Human Practices aspect of the iGEM project. She has a background in pharmacology and neuroscience and is currently an Academic Fellow in Public Health Policy in the School of Medicine where she oversees the teaching programme in medical ethics. Her research involves the ethical issues raised by advances in medicine and technology particularly in the areas of healthcare for children, reproduction/fertility, and pharmaceuticals.
