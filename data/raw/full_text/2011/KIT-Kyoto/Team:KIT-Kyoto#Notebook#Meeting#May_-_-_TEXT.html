We were advised the following things by our advisers.
We have to consider the ideas more definitely and precisely.
iGEM is the research by Undergraduates and teachers. So we should think deeply what we should do.
And we talked about the ideas of research again such as:
Making the human disease model with Drosophila melanogaster
Making E. coli which can smell.
Next week we will announce our ideas with each other.
