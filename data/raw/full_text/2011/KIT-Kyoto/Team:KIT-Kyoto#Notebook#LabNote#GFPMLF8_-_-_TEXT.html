We have transformed E. coli DH5 alpha with the plasmid BBa_E0240.
Results
The transformed bacterial colonies were obtained.

1. Pre-culture of bacteria transformed with BBa_E0240.
2. Design of primers to construct GFP plasmid without ATG from the plasmid BBa_E0240.
Results
1. We have succeeded the preculture.
2. The designed primers are shown below.

After isolation of plasmid DNA BBa_E0240 by the alkaline-lysis method, DNA samples were digested by the following restriction enzymes at 37 ℃ for 30 min.
ddH2O2 µl
BBa_E024050 µl
EcoRⅠ1 µl
PstⅠ1 µl
10 x H Buffer6 µl
 total 60 µl
After restriction enzyme digestion, samples were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel at 100 V for 30min.
Results
DNA bands in the agarose gel.
You can see DNA band at around 800bp.

Agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out to detect the PCR products.
Then the PCR products were digested with the following restriction enzymes (at 37°C for 16 hours).

BBa_E024050 µl
EcoRⅠ1 µl
PstⅠ1 µl
10 x H Buffer6 µl

1.Extraction of DNA from the agarose gel.
2.Transformation of E. coli DH5 alpha with the plasmid pSB1C3.
Results
1. Picture of agarose gel after cutting out of the portion containing the DNA fragment.
Final concentration of the isolated DNA was 510 ng/µl.
2. Although small colonies were observed, we decided to transform the bacteria again just in case.
