Ligate BBa_E0240.which doesn’t have ATG codons and pSB1C3
I have transformed E. coli DH5 alpha with it.
Before I made BBa_E0240.which doesn’t have ATG codons and pSB1C3.
The densities are 19ng/µl and 25ng/µl.
DNA samples were digested by the following restriction enzymes at 37 ℃ for 30 min.

After ligate them, I have transformed E. coli DH5 alpha with it.
Results
There aren’t any colonies on the plate.
However I heared the success probability is very low, so next time I want to be careful about the density.

1.We carried out agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the PCR products.
2.We amplified Flag-tag dMLF by using the primer which I manufactured on 6th September.
Restriction enzyme processing.
This is because after examining a sequence of Flag-tag dMLF, a restriction enzyme site of PstI and XbaI was seen.
So, I examined whether PCR product of Flag-tag dMLF is cut by PstI and XbaI.

1.We carried out agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the PCR products.
2.I extracted GFP, DNA of the vector from gel using Gel Extraction Kit .
Results 1.Image of the agarose gel.
After doubling the density of gel, a marker did not drift.
I will decide to perform it with 2% of agarose gel about the electrophoresis of Flag-tag MLF in future.
2.I measured the density with an absorbance meter afterwards.

The BBa_E0240 succeeded in the extraction from gel and recorded 156ng/µl by the measurement with the absorbance meter and the pSB1C3 became 25ng/µl.
Therefore I decided to begin an experiment of the ligation again from the next day.

I incubated them in 16°C for 30 min.
After that, I transformed them, and I poured them into 300 µl of SOC medium and add them on the plate after culture for 30 minutes.
I thought that I tried to pick at only a red colony as a point to keep in mind of this time and lowered the possibility of contaminating it.
Results
Here are many colonies on the LB medium.
Possibly contaminating is thought for example an antibiotic does not work.
The pSB1C3 was not able to be refined again.
