1. We carried out agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the PCR products.
2. We transformed E. coli XL-1 blue with the plasmid pUAST-flag.
Results
1. Image of the agarose gel.
Lane 1；size marker(1 kbp ladder）
Lane 2；the amplified API2-MALT1 cDNA fragment
Lane 3；the amplified DIAP2 cDNA fragment
Sizes of the fragments were different from the expected sizes.
2. The transformed bacterial colonies were detected.

1.  I have repeated the PCR reactions to amplify API2-MALT1 cDNA and DIAP2 cDNA under the same conditions as those carried out on 8th, August.
2. I picked up the colonies and grew them in liquid culture.
Results
2. I have successfully grown the transformed bacteria.

1. Amounts of the isolated plasmid DNA samples were quantified by measuring the absorbance at OD260.
2. We grew the transformed bacteria (25 ml x 2) and the plasmid pUAST-flag DNA was isolated by Midi-prep (Invitrogen).
Results
1. The absorbance at OD260 of two independent plasmid DNA samples are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 (OD260)
sample 1
0.1890.2080.1920.1900.191
Average value was 0.194.
Concentration of DNA was 0.970 µg/µl.
sample 2
0.2820.2760.2780.2690.269
Average value was 0.275.
Concentration of DNA was 1.37 µg/µl.
2. Image of the agarose gel.

We have tried different Annealing conditions to amplify API2-MALT1 cDNA and DIAP2 cDNA. The other conditions for the PCR reactions were same as those carried out on 8th, August.
API2-MALT1
Anneling58.9°C
DIAP2
Anneling53°C
PCR products were applied to the agarose gel electrophoresis.
Results
Image of the agarose gel.
Lane 1；DNA size marker（1 Kbp ladder）

Lane 3；DIAP2 cDNA
Size of the amplified fragments for API2-MALT1was different from the expected size and multiple DNA fragments were detected for the DIAP2.

The restriction enzyme-digested PCR fragments and pUAST-flag DNA were extracted from the agarose gel by QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit .
Results
Image of agarose gel after DNA fragment isolation.
The amount of the purified pUAST-flag vector was 45.0375 ng/µl.
PCR products for DIAP2 Was not successfully recovered from the agarose gel.
