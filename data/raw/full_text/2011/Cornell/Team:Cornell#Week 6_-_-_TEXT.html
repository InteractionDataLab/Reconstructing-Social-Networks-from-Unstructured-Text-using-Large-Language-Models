July 10th - July 16th
Sunday, July 10
Lab work done by: James Mathew, Charlie Chung
Worked on website
- Preliminary design of banner, safety content, and temporary lab notebook spreadsheet
Ligation product was transformed in electrocompetent cells
Culture plated on agar plate treated with ampicillin
Plasmid containing the Vio operon was transformed and plated on agar treated with kanamycin
Overnight PCR reaction for RFP
Monday, July 11
Tuesday, July 12
Finished final design of team logo
Wednesday, July 13
"Website Team" meeting to continue design and construction of website
- Designed and constructed final banner design
Thursday, July 14
Lab work done by: James Mathew, Charlie Chung
Sequencing revealed no GFP in the ligation product
Will retry the 3-piece ligation of GFP + Annealed Primer Pair A (half of biotin tag) + Annealed Primer Pair B (other half of biotin tag & iGEM suffix)
PCR to amplify vector backbone containing RFP
Met Prof. Lucks -- prospective iGEM advisor and coolest man alive
Friday, July 15
Banner was updated to include Flash animation of moving gears.
Team Meeting
Ligation didn't work -- retry over the weekend
- transform and plate today
- inoculate and colony PCR on Saturday
- Miniprep and prepare for sequencing on Sunday
Prepare more culture of backbone plasmid
- inoculate today
- Miniprep on Saturday
Order primers today for other methods of ligation: (1) longer primers (2) two-step PCR with shorter primers
Order primers for our pathway enzymes: VioA, VioB, VioB
- Primers should come Wednesday
- If ligation this weekend fails, we can try these other PCR methods
Animations and website construction are continuing
Lab work done by: James Mathew, Charlie Chung, Youjin Cho
Running low on pZE vector backbone, so fired up two cultures
Miniprep to purify out the plasmid. Followed standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol for microcentrifuge
Verify if PCR amplification of RFP worked using gel electrophoresis. If yes, then proceed to gel extraction and purification
- NOTE: Thermocycler did not keep our rxn tube at 4°C
Electroporation method of transforming our 3-piece ligation product and control into DH5α (competent E. coli = made porous for uptake of outside DNA)
Plated transformed bacteria onto agar plates treated with ampicillin
Saturday, July 16
Lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Nicholas Kramer
Growth of numerous colonies suggests the ligation reaction worked
- Will pick 2 colonies off the plate in the evening and inoculate overnight
PCR to amplify vector backbone containing RFP
- Melting temperature of 57°C leads to non-specific binding
- Ran 2 PCR reactions with melting temperatures 59°C and 61°C
