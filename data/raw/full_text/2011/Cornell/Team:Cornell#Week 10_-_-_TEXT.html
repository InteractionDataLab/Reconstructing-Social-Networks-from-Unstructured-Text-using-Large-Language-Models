Sunday, August 7
Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Claire Paduano
Objective
Prepare VioE in AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone for VioA and VioB gene inserts
Digestion Setup

Evening lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Objective
Because previous DH5α colonies transformed with (VioE + AviTagged backbone) are very small, in addition to one failed 5mL culture and one discarded Miniprep sample, incubated plate for four more hours
Picked three new colonies. Labeled as "VioE + AviTag + BB #4, 5, 6"
5mL LB cultures with 5μL ampicillin incubated overnight in 37°C shaker of Room 304
Monday, August 8
Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho, James Mathew
Objective
Transform the overnight ligation of VioA/VioB + AviTag + pZE12
Send the Miniprepped samples (GFP, RFP, VioE) from Saturday in for sequencing
Miniprep the additional VioE samples that were grown overnight
Transformation
Desalted the ligation reaction samples (VioA/VioB + AviTag + pZE12) on a membrane for 15 minutes
After adding the samples into DH5α cell lines, electroporated them and put into shaker for 45 minutes
The samples were plated on the plate with ampicillin
Sequencing
Using the reverse primer dilution, the samples were sent in for sequencing
GFP + AviTag + pZE12 - 1
GFP + AviTag + pZE12 - 2
GFP + AviTag + pZE12 - 3
RFP + AviTag + pZE12 - 1
RFP + AviTag + pZE12 - 2
RFP + AviTag + pZE12 - 3
VioE + AviTag + pZE12 - 2
Miniprepping the VioE samples
The samples were Miniprepped using standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol
VioE + AviTag + pZE12 - 4
VioE + AviTag + pZE12 - 5
VioE + AviTag + pZE12 - 6
Evening lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Checked to see if colonies were ready to pick from transformed plates of (VioA + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) and (VioB + AviTagged pZE12 backbone)
VioA plate is showing early signs of a good number of colonies. Too small for picking, however
VioB and Control plates look pretty empty (but just may not have grown up enough to tell)
Will be best if colonies were picked Tuesday (tomorrow) morning. Please find the 3 plates still in the 37°C incubator
Tuesday, August 9
Evening lab work done by: Youjin Cho
Picked colonies from transformed plates of (VioA + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) and (VioB + AviTagged pZE12 backbone).

VioB 1,2,3
Put them into the 37°C shaker around 5:30pm

DNA Purification of VioA, VioB Samples
The samples were Miniprepped using standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol
VioA + AviTag + pZE12 - 1 = 67.6 ng/µL
VioA + AviTag + pZE12 - 2 = 70.6 ng/µL

Order Number: 10254703
VioA-1
VioA-2
VioA-3
VioB-1
VioB-2

PCR for GFP
Since the result from the sequencing showed that GFP did not work, ran a PCR reaction using the original template of GFP in pZE12
Ran two reactions and labeled them 1,2 GFP iGEM 8/10
1 GFP = the sample from May 5 of GFP on pZE12 with concentration of 50.6 ng/µL
2 GFP = the sample missing the date with concentration of 20.2 ng/µL
The PCR was ran with melting temperature of 54.2°C for 1 minute

Team Meeting
Checked the sequencing for VioA and VioB -- VioA worked, but VioB didn't
- Need to PCR off the VioB gene and repeat ligation with AviTagged backbone
Need to figure out the flow rate that we will use for the microfluidics device
Ask Dr. Archer about the protocol for taking picture/video with the microscope
Lab Work for This Week
Microfluidics
Need to induce the RFP cultures overnight (Friday evening)
Lyse the cells and run through the device to see if works (Saturday afternoon)
Lab Work
Transform the ligation of GFP + AviTag + pZE12 backbone and incubate overnight (Friday evening)
Store the plates away in 4°C and pick colonies from them late at night (Saturday)
Miniprep the GFP samples (Sunday afternoon)
Submit (GFP + AviTag + pZE12) for sequencing
Set up PCR reaction for VioB gene and repeat the ligation steps (next week)
Afternoon lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Objective
Prepare a subculture of bacteria with (RFP + AviTagged pZE12) plasmid for production of RFP
Transformation of (GFP + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) into DH5α electrocompetent bacteria and plated with 1:1000 ampicillin.
Prepare freezer stocks of DH5α bacteria transformed with (RFP + AviTagged pZE12) and AviTagged pZE12
Miniprep remaining volume of (RFP + AviTagged pZE12) and AviTagged pZE12 cultures
Preparing a Subculture
Set up two cuvettes for preliminary optical density (OD) reading: (1) control (2) RFP sample from Thursday evening
- Purpose of preliminary OD reading is to determine how much RFP sample you need to add to a new 25mL culture
- Use a 1:10 dilution of sample to minimize error when running the spectrophotometer
Control: 1000µL LB
RFP Sample: 900µL LB + 100µL (RFP + AviTagged pZE12) Colony #5
RFP Sample OD = 0.283 (treat as [bacteria with RFP]), which translates to actual OD of 2.83 in Thursday's 5mL culture tube (after undoing the 1:10 dilution)
Use dilution equation to determine how much RFP bacteria culture is needed for the 25mL culture
(2.83)(? µL) = (desired beginning [RFP bacteria] = 0.05)(25mL = 25000µL)
? = 441.7µL Thursday's RFP bacteria culture to 25mL LB + 25µL ampicillin
Incubate new 25mL RFP bacteria subculture in 37°C shaker for ~2 hours and 45 minutes
At end of incubation time, check OD. Target OD = 0.6-0.8, which means ready for induction of RFP production via IPTG
Induce 25mL RFP bacteria culture with 25µL 1M IPTG for desired 1mM addition (completed at 7:25pm)
Incubate induced 25mL culture flask on room temperature shaker
Preparation of Freezer Stock
1:1 volume ratio of 30% glycerol and bacteria culture media
- Added 500µL 30% glycerol and 500µL (RFP + AviTagged pZE12) into three cryogenic storage tubes
- Added 500µL 30% glycerol and 500µL AviTagged pZE12 into three cryogenic storage tubes
- Stored in the -80°C freezer of Room 303
Miniprep
Followed standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol
NanoDrop spectrophotometry to determine DNA concentrations
AviTagged pZE12 backbone Sample 1 = 102.2ng/µL
AviTagged pZE12 backbone Sample 2 = 135.2ng/µL
(RFP + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) Sample 1 = 127ng/µL
(RFP + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) Sample 2 = 97.3ng/µL
Saturday, August 13
Afternoon lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Objective
Lyse the 25mL culture of IPTG-induced (RFP + AviTagged backbone) bacteria
Collect RFP protein
Procedure
Bring BugBuster Protein Extraction lysis buffer (EMD4Biosciences of Merck) to room temperature
Transfer 25mL culture to 50mL conical that is previously tared (later, we will need to measure mass of bacterial pellet). Centrifuge at 4500rpm for 25 minutes
Pour out supernatant. Measure mass of bacterial pellet. 0.4g * (5mL BugBuster per g of cells) = 2mL BugBuster
Rock for 20 minutes
Centrifuge at maximum rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C
Collect supernatant (RFP will be soluble here)
Evening lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Attempted to pick and culture colonies of (GFP + AviTagged backbone). However, couldn't find keys to Room 303. Thus, I was unable to pick and begin 3mL cultures
Sorry for creating more work, but please complete this task Sunday morning
