Evening lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Picking Colonies and Starting Up Cultures of VioB Ligation Reaction
(AviTagged pZE12 backbone) control plate shows no growth of colonies
(VioB + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) plate shows numerous colonies
- Picked three colonies (VioB + AviTag + BB #1, 2, 3) and started 3mL cultures in LB with 3μL ampicillin
- Incubated overnight in the 37°C shaker of Room 304
PCR Reaction Setup of GFP (because sequencing results were negative)
38.5μL ddH2O
5μL 10x buffer
2.5μL dNTP
1μL forward GFP primer
1μL reverse GFP primer
1μL (pZE12+GFP) backbone template
1μL Vent DNA polymerase
50μL Total
Annealing temperature of 54.2°C
1 minute extension cycle
Monday, August 22
Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho
Objective
Miniprep the VioB + AviTag + pZE12 samples and submit for sequencing
Miniprep and Sequencing
Miniprepped the VioB + AviTag + pZE12 (1,2,3) samples using standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol
Using 1μL of pZE12 reverse primer dilution and 17μL of each template, prepared and submitted the samples for sequencing.
Order number: 10255430

Afternoon lab work done by: Claire Paduano, Maneesh Gupta, Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Objective
Set up new ligation of GFP and AviTagged backbone
Send out gel purified GFP PCR reaction product to troubleshoot why our procedure isn't working
Conducted gel electrophoresis on PCR reaction product of GFP
- Visualization of migrated DNA fragments does not show a GFP band around 750bp
Redid PCR on GFP
- Note: This time, we made sure to add 1µL MgSO4
37.5μL ddH2O
5μL 10x buffer
1μL 25mM dNTP
1μL MgSO4
1μL forward GFP primer
1μL reverse GFP primer

Gel purified digested Avi-Tagged Backbone
Ligation
GFP + Avi-Tagged Backbone
5.8μL Avi-Tagged pZE12 vector backbone
7.97μL GFP
3.4μL H2O
2.0μL T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA Ligase
20μL Total
In above reaction, volume of plasmid vector added corresponds with 50ng backbone.
Prepare control ligation reactions (inserts replaced with H2O) for each of the above constructs.
Same volume of vector backbone, buffer, ligase
Volumes of all inserts (i.e. gene) go toward volume of H2O
After ligation setup, incubate at 16degC overnight.

Lab work done by: Youjin Cho
Transformation for GFP
Desalted the ligation of GFP into AviTag + pZE12 backbone and the control on a membrane for 15 minutes
Transformed the ligation GFP sample and control in DH5α electrocomptent cells via electroporation
After shaking the cells in 37°C shaker for 50 minutes, plated onto agar treated with ampicilin and incubated overnight at 37°C

Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho
Checked the plates for GFP+Avitag+pZE12, but the ratio of ligation to control was bad.
Afternoon lab work done by: James Mathew, Maneesh Gupta, Claire Paduano
Set up ligation for a second time since previous ligation was bad
Ligation
GFP + AviTagged Backbone
3.52μL AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
7.97μL GFP
5.54μL H2O
2.0μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA ligase
20μL Total
In above reaction, volume of plasmid vector added corresponds with 50ng backbone
Prepare control ligation reactions (inserts replaced with H2O) for each of the above constructs

Weill Hall lab work done by: Claire Paduano, James Mathew
Microfluidic channel (bright field)
Negative control
Streptavidin coated channel after ATTO-590 flushed though
Objective
Coat microfluidic device with steptavidin.
Run biotinylated fluorescent ATTO dye to test binding [ ATTO dye info ]
Streptavidin coating and fluorescent labeling
Protocol from Gleghorn et al: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20024046
1) 45 min in 4% (by volume) MPTMS in ethanol
2) 20 min in 1mM GMBS
3) 45 min in 25ng/mL NeutrAvidin in PBS
