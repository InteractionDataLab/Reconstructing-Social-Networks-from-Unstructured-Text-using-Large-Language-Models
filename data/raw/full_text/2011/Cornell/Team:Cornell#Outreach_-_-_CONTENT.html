</DD></DL><P>Since SB5.0, many iGEM teams have come together to create <A href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM_Outreach" class="external text" rel="nofollow">CommunityBricks</A>, a resource of outreach and human practices activities for future iGEM teams to use and add to. We envision that this resource--soon to be a part of iGEM.org--will help iGEM teams promote synthetic biology to the global community.
</P><DL><DD>Additionally, Cornell has been collaborating with iGEM HQ and other iGEM teams to create iGEM's alumni association.  We all assisted Brown-Stanford iGEM in creating a fabulous networking tool, the <A href="http://alumni.brownigem.com" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AlumniGEM forums</A>, which contains alumni profiles and discussion platforms. And check out the beginnings of the <A href="https://igem.org/Alumni_Association" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AlumniGEM website</A>, a collaboration between iGEM teams and iGEM HQ to keep alumni connected to iGEM and synthetic biology!

Our seminar on the Ethics of Synthetic Biology (approved by Cornell's <A href="http://bovay.ece.cornell.edu/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Bovay Program for Ethics in Engineering</A>) teaches beginning engineering students about ethical issues surrounding current techniques and applications of synthetic biology. Students are encouraged to debate over controversial issues such as utilizing cows to produce milk with human enzymes and patenting cancer screening techniques. Students also learn about different aspects of ethical analysis. Intellectual property rights, potential risks in recombinant DNA technology, progress vs. profit, and other important aspects of the biotechnology industry are also discussed. The seminar’s main purpose is to get students thinking about future work they might participate in and about potential ethical dilemmas they might encounter. The seminar emphasizes the responsibility that engineers have regarding the research they conduct and the products they produce.

These girls were invited to Cornell to gain experience in a laboratory working on research-inspired projects. These projects were designed to exercise their ability to problem solve and troubleshoot as they worked towards their goal. Cornell iGEM lead the “Bio Boot Camp” session on the first day of the program, teaching the students basic lab techniques (pipetting small volumes, plating bacteria, running a PCR gel) as well as showing them some of the equipment in the laboratory. During the week that followed, Cornell iGEMers worked as teaching assistants with small teams of students on the following group projects:
</P><DL><DD><UL><LI>Microvascular Chips
</LI><LI>Wireless Combination Lock
</LI><LI>Sleep Apnea Feedback Device
</LI><LI>Protein Localization in Mammalian Cells
</LI><LI>Sun Tracker
</LI></UL></DD></DL><P>For instance, the Microvascular Chips group used a microfluidic chip to model blood flow in small capillaries. They measured baseline flow speeds by taking videos through the laboratory’s microscopes and calculated the resistance in each channel from the flow speeds and channel diameters. Then they plugged one channel to simulate a blood clot and measured the changes in flow speed and channel resistance. Using resistance as an analogy for an electrical circuit, students then calculated the flow speeds that they expected to find based on simple physics and compared their findings to expected results. This project was framed in the context of modeling a small stroke, but it can be also used to model many biological systems involving blood flow in small capillaries.

The presentation included elementary explanations of the central dogma of biology, recombinant DNA technology, cloning techniques, BioBricks, and iGEM.  A brief list of fun synthetic biology applications was also presented.
</P><P>
Additionally, hands-on activities were provided to explain genetic diversity and DNA extraction. In the Build-A-Bug activity, children flipped coins to determine the genotypes of their bugs and then built the bugs according to the phenotypes of the different body parts. Through this activity, children learned about basic ideas of dominant and recessive genes. In the DNA Necklace activity, children learned how to isolate DNA from wheat germ. Extracted DNA was placed into eppendorf tubes for children to keep.
