Sunday, July 31
Monday, August 1
Lab work done by: Jim Mathew
Sent VioE and AviTag + backbone in for sequencing
Tuesday, August 2
Microfluidics work done by: Jim Mathew, Nick Kramer, Dan Levine, Claire Paduano, Youjin Cho, Bill Jo
Microfluidics
Dr. Archer showed us how to use the clean room
Made a SU-8 master of our device
Poured PDMS and baked overnight at 60°C
Followed protocol that is used by Biomedical Engineering lab class and is provided by Dr. Archer
Wednesday, August 3
Microfluidics work done by: Jim Mathew, Nick Kramer, Dan Levine, Claire Paduano, Youjin Cho, Bill Jo
Microfluidics
Dr. Archer showed us how to cut out PDMS devices and seal to clean glass slides using plasma cleaner
Tested chips for blockages in flow
- Three working devices, one with complete blockage in the channel
Poured more PDMS and baked overnight at 60°C
Followed protocol used in Biomedical Engineering lab class and provided by Dr. Archer
Thursday, August 4
Morning lab work done by: Jim Mathew
Objective
Prepare Avi-Tagged pZE12 vector backbone for GFP, RFP, and VioE gene inserts
Digestion Setup in Duplicate
32.6μL H2O
9.9μL AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone (2μg)
5μL 10x NEBuffer 4
0.5μL 100x BSA
1μL KpnI-HF (HF = high fidelity)
1μL SphI-HF
50μL Total
Incubate in 37°C water bath for 2 hours
Dephosphorylation of 5' Ends of Vector Backbone
Add 1μL of Calf Intestine Alkaline Phosphatase (CIAP) to digested vector backbone in order to prevent self-ligation without gene insert included
Incubate at 50°C for 5 minutes
Run vector backbone through agarose gel electrophoresis
Gel Extraction and Purification of Digested Backbone
Followed standard Qiagen Gel Extraction protocol for pZE12 vector backbone that is now AviTagged and digested with KpnI and SphI
NanoDrop spectrophotometry on the duplicate samples reported 12.7ng/μL and 14.2ng/μL
Afternoon lab work done by: Claire Paduano, Charlie Chung
Objective
Ligation of GFP, RFP, and VioE genes with AviTagged pZE12 backbone
Ligation
GFP + AviTagged Backbone
10.6μL AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
3.6μL GFP
2.8μL H2O
2.0μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA ligase
20μL Total
RFP + AviTagged Backbone
10.3μL AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
6.7μL RFP
2.0μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA ligase
20μL Total
VioE + AviTagged Backbone
10.6μL AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
4.1μL VioE
2.3μL H2O
2.0μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA ligase
20μL Total
In all above reactions, volume of plasmid vector added corresponds with 100ng backbone
Prepare control ligation reactions (inserts replaced with H2O) for each of the above constructs
Same volume of vector backbone, buffer, ligase
Volumes of all inserts (i.e. gene) go toward volume of H2O
After ligation setup, incubate in 16°C water bath overnight
Ligation reaction volumes were calculated using a formulated spreadsheet (see Protocol page) that is based on 100ng of vector backbone and a 3:1 molar ratio of insert:vector
Reference for Inserts and Vector Backbone
RFP gene - 678bp
GFP gene - 717bp
vioE gene - 576bp
pZE12 vector - 2340bp
Friday, August 5
Lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Claire Paduano
Objective
Transform ligation of GFP/RFP/VioE + AviTagged backbone
Desalted overnight ligation
Transformed the samples into DH5α electrocompetent cells
Group Meeting
Just finished transforming GFP/RFP/VioE + AviTag + pZE12 backbone
If the VioE gene successfully inserts and ligates with the AviTagged backbone, then we can ligate in VioA and VioB this weekend
Goal: to treat PDMS devices to coat with streptavidin and bind AviTagged GFP and RFP to device
Saturday, August 6
Lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Miniprepped 5mL cultures of transformed DH5α electrocompetent bacteria (standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol)
NOTE: White masses were floating in bacteria culture -- potential contamination?
NanoDrop spectrophotometry to determine DNA concentration of 50µL elution product
RFP (Colony 1) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 53.2ng/µL
RFP (Colony 2) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 63.4ng/µL
RFP (Colony 3) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 76.6ng/µL
GFP (Colony 1) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 65.7ng/µL
GFP (Colony 2) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 65.5ng/µL
GFP (Colony 3) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 46.6ng/µL
VioE (Colony 1) did not grow in its culture tube
VioE (Colony 2) + AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone = 53.8ng/µL
DNA from VioE (Colony 3) was accidentally discarded...Charlie is extremely ashamed.
