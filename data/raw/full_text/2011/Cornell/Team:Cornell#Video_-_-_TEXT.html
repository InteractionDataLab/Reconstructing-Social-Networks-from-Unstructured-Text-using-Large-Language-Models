Animation - Come See Our Animations at Our Presentation!
I'm Fun to Click
Using Visuals to Connect the Dots
Bringing up    "Synthetic Biology" in a conversation with anyone outside the field    will elicit question marks.
Anything muttered    after those words will be forever lost to the public.
 
CUGEM aims to    level the playing field. We seek to communicate our ideas with the public via    effective animation and communication skills.  Our presentations are designed to entice our audience, draw them in, and    enable them to attach our explanations to physical phenomena. 
 
As a result, this    year we've created a designated animation sub-team consisting of Dan Levine    (Mechanical Engineer) and Nicholas Kramer (Electrical and Computer Engineer).    Under the direction of team leader Jim Mathews,  we've broken up our project into scenes that    will best explain our project. Along the way, we've established a strong set of    methodologies, techniques, and resources to build up our animation team in the    coming years.
 
A overview of    our work can be found on the pages linked by the images above.
 
We'd also like to    thank Luxology greatly for their support. Building up our sub-team required a    significant investment of time and resources.
 
Their intuitive and    powerful software - Modo - made this possible.
