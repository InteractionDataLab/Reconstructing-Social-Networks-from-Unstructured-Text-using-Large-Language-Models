Morning lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Western Blot to Confirm Expression of VioA, B, E and GFP in Cell Lysate
Bradford Assay to Determine Protein Concentration of Samples
Prepare 6 serial dilutions of BSA (10mg/mL from NEB) in triplicate
- Add 18.4µL ddH2O to wells A1, B1, C
- Add 1.6µL BSA to Column 1
- Add 10µL ddH2O to wells A2-7, B2-7, C2-7
- Mix and pipet up 10µL from Column 1. Transfer to Column 2 and mix. Discard tips
- Repeat down the columns. For Column 7, discard 10µL after mixing
Prepare dilution of control lysate; VioA, B, E; and GFP samples
- Add 8µL ddH2O to wells A8-12, B8-12, C8-12
- Add 2µL of control lysate to Column 8; VioA to Column 9; VioB to Column 10; VioE to Column 11; GFP to Column 12
Add 100µL 1X Bio-Rad Protein Assay Bradford Dye to all wells (both BSA standard and samples)
Wait 10 minutes
Measure absorbance at 595nm using spectrophotometer
Calculate volume of sample to be added for 40µg/mL of total protein
Add 7µL of protein loading dye (with β-mercaptoethanol) to 35µL sample and boil for 10 minutes at 95°C
Load 10µL ladder, 11.4µL control lysate, 24.4µL VioA, 13.4µL VioB, 14.4µL VioE, 13.4µL GFP
Run for 1 hour at 90V
Transfer onto PVDF membrane for 1 hour at 80mAmp
Wash membrane in TBS for 10 minutes
Block with 5% dry milk in 20mL of TBS overnight
PCR of GFP-AviTag-pZE12 to Construct Prefix-GFP-AviTag-Stop-Suffix
Previous failures of PCR were due to accidental use of dATP instead of dNTPs (label on Eppendorf was messy and ambiguous)
- 2.5µL 10mM dNTPs
- 51°C and 1 minute for annealing temperature and cycle duration
- 1µL of template

39.7µL ddH2O
5µL 10x NEBuffer 3
2.8µL pSB1C3 backbone
0.5µL 100x BSA
1µL EcoRI
1µL PstI
50µL Total
Digestion Setup of GFP-AviTag Insert
30.5µL ddH2O
12µL GFP-AviTag insert
5µL 10x NEBuffer 3
0.5µL 100x BSA
1µL EcoRI
1µL PstI
50µL Total
Western Blot Results
Used α-biotin 1° antibody with HRP to select for the biotinylated AviTag peptide on GFP and VioA, B, E
- 1 minute, 5 minute, and 50 minute film exposure confirmed expression of GFP, VioA, and VioE
- Control lysate of pZE12 vector without AviTag correctly displays no band
- Band for VioB protein expression not showing
Evening lab work done by: Maneesh Gupta
Microfluidic Chip Construction
- Poured 10:1 ratio of PDMS for microfluidic chip construction
- Placed molds in oven at 60 degrees Celsius overnight

Microfluidic Chip Construction
- Cut chips and bonded to glass slide
Wednesday, October 26
Evening lab work done by: Maneesh Gupta
Shear Test
Prepared 2 coated chips with Atto 590
- Control chip was Atto 590 under no flow
- Test chip was under a flow rate of 5µl/min
- Pictures taken in air every 30min for 2 hours
- Ran overnight for 8.5 hours
