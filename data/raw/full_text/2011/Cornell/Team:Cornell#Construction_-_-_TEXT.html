Summary of Component Development:
Syringe          Model - Measured Dimensions in Lab. Modeled and textured scale model in          Modo.
Syringe Pump Model -          Used online dimensions for syringe pump used in lab. Modeled and textured          in modo.
Tube Model          - Measured Dimensions in Lab. Modeled and textured in Modo.
Microfluidic          Chip Model - Modeled in Solidworks. Cleaned up mesh in Modo. Textured in          Modo.

VioE - Point data          found using PDB databases. Polycount reduced and protein refined in          Blender. Imported to and textured in Modo.
System for Flow:
Experimented           with recoil dynamics package. In tests, this seemed feasible. However,  given the high resolution of protein           models, it would be very difficult to implement with given resources.
Developed flow system           as part of an animation rig. Rig contained functions that would output           varying degrees of morph-mapped position deformations in relation to the           distance of a protein from its target bond-site. In practice, this didn't look           as nice as intended. Also very processor intensive: caused Modo to become           very unstable. Abandoned this element of the rig due to these setbacks.
Went back to recoil           dynamics package. Reduced resource drain of proteins using a manually           modeled protein with significantly fewer polygons. Had proteins follow an           attractive force constrained via path constraint to a curve running along           the tube. Simulation and efforts successful - satisfactory flow was achieved           for 140 globular style proteins. Future updates may increase number or           improve flow behavior.
Coating          Channels with Streptavidin:
Created a           mesh skin from chip model surface and replicated streptavidin proteins onto           surface. Main roadblock encountered was in problems with overlapping.
New mesh           skin created from chip model surface, incorporating offsets from channel edges. Replication of proteins using replicators was           successful. Attempted replicator freeze to get individual instances for           recoil dynamics (see system for bonding).           Proteins too complex for given resources, making freeze scene unusable.
Using developed           animation rig, instanced rig. Manually placed rig instances on channel           surface using quad view and snapping. Successful. Worked for rig.
Maintaining           successful rig scene as an option. Created an jittered instance array of           lower resolution avidin meshes for use with reverse dynamic technique (see system for bonding)
System for          Bonding:
Idea to           use dynamics simulation and run in reverse. Attempted with frozen           instances of replicated high resolution avidins. Too resource intensive.           Unusable.
Developed           animation rig that enabled permanent bonding using distance and angle           measurements relative to locaters placed at the starts of channels and           across from protein bond target sites. VioE "flowing" proteins           parented to a locater constrained to a curve defining the general path of           flow. Successful, but not "molecular" looking enough for some           team members.
Reattempt at           dynamics using much lower resolution meshes. Somewhat successful, more           random and real looking. Less effective at getting the point across. Work           in progress.
 
Modifications to Description:
In order to simplify          things for the audience and the animators, cell gunk was limited to          proteins of focus.
Scene was also          divided into separate tube and bonding scenes for simplicity and clarity.
The tube scene acts           as a transition between E. Coli lysis and bonding.
Bonding scene           switches to clear view of channel bonding.
"Construction"          switched to screen output of Syringe Pump to introduce the construction          process and help the audience understand what's going on.
 
Summary of Scene Progression
Preview Draft Bonding Scene
Animation Rig Assembly  - (08/02/2011          - 09/04/2011)
(08/02/2011           - 08/11/2011)
First Rendition using dot product of position vectors to     protein and protein target. Achieved accurate bonding for single protein. Great     on test bed, lots of trouble when transplanted to real thing --> couldn't     scale up effectively. System scratched.
(08/18/2011          - 09/04/2011)
From previous system, understood the need to make a test bed     significantly more like the scene with the scene scale. System developed     described briefly in System for Bonding in Component Development Summary. In     summary used and conditions with     locaters placed to measure a variety of variables so that once bonding occurred     proteins would exhibit no further motion. System was scalable. Replaced     stand-in geometry with proper outputs. Rig instanced and placed 140 times for     reach instance of bonding. Success. Ran off a single key-framed channel.
Component Assembly (08/11/2011 - 09/04/2011)
Before building the new           test bed straight into the scene, established the macroscopic scene.
(08/11/2011 - 08/18/2011)
Scaled up macroscale components to 200,000x their actual size to make     things easier to work with. Created basic scene layout.
(08/18/2011 - 09/04/2011)
Picked and modified texturing to allow for a balance of decent render     times and visual appeal.
Experimental Dynamics Work (09/11/2011 - present)
(09/11/2011 - present)
Developed low resolution meshes for proteins. Running     simulations. Desired results not quite achieved yet.
 
Reception and Review: Team would     like more dynamic work. Otherwise, satisfied with result.
 
Full Draft Tube Scene (08/1/2011     - 09/11/2011) :
Dynamics Testing - (08/1/2011-08/11/2011)
Learned how to use dynamics package to achieve a semblance of flow     through a tube. Learned the importance of making sure mesh centers are aligned.     Also learned how to properly align mesh centers.
Rigged Motion - (08/02/2011 - 09/04/2011)
Rig did not provide nice enough flow and was barely usable when     including morph map system. Scratched.
Dynamics and new Component Assembly - (09/04/2011          - 09/11/2011)
Used final System for Flow component described in Component Development. 140 globular style proteins with dynamics. Baked movements. Did a lot of camera     work with targets, graph editor, and path constraints to achieve desired     result.
 
Reception and Review: Very     positive feedback.
