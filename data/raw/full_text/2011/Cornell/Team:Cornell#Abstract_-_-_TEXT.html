Project description
Our current proposed project for the summer is the fabrication of a microfluidic device for the cell-free production of bio-pharmaceuticals by binding the necessary enzymes of the pathway to the surface of the channel. The enzymes would be harvested from cellular lysate created by engineering light-induced cell death in bacterial populations which produce the needed enzymes. The hope of the team is to automate and simplify the device construction to allow for a scalable mircofluidic factory.
