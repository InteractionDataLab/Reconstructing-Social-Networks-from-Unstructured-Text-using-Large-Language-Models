Lab work done by: Jim Mathew, Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Background
The PCR site-directed mutagenesis done earlier today should ideally enhance protein expression of VioA, VioB, VioE, and RFP by deleting excessive nucleotides between the ribosome binding site and the ATG start codon in the original DNA sequences
Work Accomplished
PCR procedure for deletion technique
Using 1µl of PCR product of VioA, VioB, VioE and RFP, transformed them into DH5α electrocompetent cells via electroporation
Put the transformed samples in 37°C shaker for an hour
Plated the transformed products of VioA, VioB, VioE, and RFP on agar plates treated with ampicillin or carbenicillin (two are on amp; other two are on carb)
Incubating at 37°C in Olin 303
Tuesday, September 20
Afternoon lab work done by: Charlie Chung
VioA, VioB, and VioE plates = lots of bacterial colonies, high-density growth
- Picked three colonies from each plate and started up (3mL LB + 3µL carbenicillin) cultures
VioA-1,2,3
VioB-1,2,3
VioE-1,2,3
- Incubating at 37°C in Olin 304
RFP plate = ~5 colonies
- Picked two colonies and started up (3mL LB + 3µL carbenicillin) cultures
RFP-1,2
- Incubating at 37°C in Olin 304
Wednesday, September 21
Morning lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Transferred 500µL from each culture tube to 20mL (LB + carbenicillin) subcultures
- Shaking at 37°C in Olin 304
Miniprep the remaining cultures of VioA-1,2,3 ; VioB-1,2,3 ; VioE-1,2,3 ; RFP-1,2
- Because of time constraint, was not able to quantify the DNA concentration
- Sitting in the freezer of Olin 301
Afternoon lab work done by: Nancy Li, Youjin Cho
After 5 hours of subculturing, transferred all the samples into corresponding 50mL tubes and spun them down at 4500rpm for 30 minutes
Poured off the supernatant and stored the pellets at -20°C for future use

Preparation of GFP+AviTag Insert
PCR of Sean's GFP+AviTag+pZE12 construct
Note: Thermocycler in our Weill Hall lab does not seem to be cooling down quickly enough in between cycles. Retried PCR reaction in Olin Hall lab. Tube got warped again.
- Primers are designed to amplify ("lift off") only the GFP+AviTag and simultaneously add the iGEM prefix and suffix
Ran PCR reaction product on an agarose gel to check for amplification and to purify the DNA
- Observed bright bands with migration rate matching 700bp of the ladder
Gel purification and DNA quantification via NanoDrop spectrophotometry
- [GFP+AviTag] = 82 ng/µL
- 260/230 ratio was below 2.0-2.2, suggesting contaminants are still present in gel-purified product
Digest the GFP+AviTag insert to create sticky ends that match iGEM's pSB1C3 backbone
