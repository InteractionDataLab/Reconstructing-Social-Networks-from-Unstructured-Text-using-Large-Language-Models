October 16th - October 22nd
Sunday, October 16
Morning lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Preparing 100mL Cultures of VioA, B, E and pZE12 Vector
Inoculate two baffled flasks of (50mL LB + 50µL ampicillin) each with 1mL of yesterday's culture for a 1:50 dilution
Shake at 37°C for 2.5 hours and check OD reading (if 0.05-0.08, then ready for IPTG-induction)
OD after 2.5 hours = 0.1xx (VioA), 0.08 (VioB), 0.1xx (VioE) -- too dense again...
- Next time, check OD after 2 hours when doing a 1:50 subculture
Induced with 5µL 1M IPTG for 0.1µM addition to a 50mL culture
Shaking at room temperature for 20+ hours, after which we will pellet the cells for lysis and protein extraction
Night lab work done by: Nicholas Kramer
Making Microfluidic Chips
Poured 55g of 10:1 PDMS over the molds and put in 60°C oven overnight
Monday, October 17
Morning lab work done by: Jim Mathew, Charlie Chung
Submitted VioA, B, E and GFP for sequencing to confirm PCR deletion
Preparing VioA, B, E and pZE12 for Protein Extraction
Spin down the 100mL of each culture into pellets (3700rpm for 30 min)
- Stored in -20°C fridge of Olin 301
Afternoon lab work done by: Maneesh Gupta and Claire Paduano
Making Microfluidic Chips
Cut PDMS off of mold and bonded to glass slide with O2 plasma
Tested resulting chips, 6 new chips made
Poured 55g of 10:1 PDMS on molds and put in the 60°C oven overnight
Tuesday, October 18
Afternoon lab work done by: Bill Jo
Making Microfluidic Chips
Cut out PDMS and bonded to glass slide using O2 plasma
Tested resulting chips, 3 new chips made
Poured 55g of 10:1 PDMS over mold and put in the 60°C oven overnight
Wednesday, October 19
Morning lab work done by: Bill Jo
Making Microfluidic Chips
Cut out PDMS and bonded to glass slide using O2 plasma
Tested resulting chips, 8 new chips
Afternoon lab work done by: Jim Mathew, Youjin Cho
Lysing GFP and pZE12 Control
Lysed the GFP and pZE12 control using BugBuster
After adding 5mL of BugBuster to each sample, shook in incubator for 20 minutes
Spun the samples down for 20 minutes at 4°C at maximum speed
(Lysed samples of GFP and pZE12 control stored in 4°C)
Thursday, October 20
Friday, October 21
Afternoon lab work done by: Archana Rachakonda, Jim Mathew, Charlie Chung
Spin down 1L cultures of newly transformed (because of sequencing results negative for PCR deletion) VioA, B, E and pZE12
- Stored in -20°C freezer of Olin 301
PCR of GFP-AviTag-pZE12 to create final construct of Prefix-GFP-AviTag-Stop-Suffix
Run on gel
- PCR failed: no bands of amplified product
Redo PCR with two adjustments
(1) Lower annealing temperature from 53.2°C to 50.0°C
(2) Increase volume of GFP-AviTag-pZE12 template from 0.5µL to 1µL
Saturday, October 22
Lab work done at Olin Hall by: Jim Mathew, Charlie Chung
Lysed cell pellets of VioA, B, E and empty pZE12 vector using BugBuster
- Note: VioB pellet is red. Acting on its substrate somewhere in the culture? Confirms active status of enzyme?
- Transferred lysate to teammates in Weill Hall running experiment of binding Vio enzymes to microfluidics chips and passing substrate (L-tryptophan) through
Gel electrophoresis on PCR product to verify amplification
- PCR with two adjustments still failed: only bands of the ladder showed
Lab work done at Weill Hall by: Maneesh Gupta, Archana Rachakonda, Jim Mathew
Ran full test of the Biofactory
- 4 groups in parallel with 3 coated chips in each group
- Enzymes were incubated in the chips for 1 hour with no flow. The enzyme solution was then replace with fresh enzyme solution and incubated again for 1 hr
- Flowed L-tryptophan solution through all 4 groups at 5µl/min for 6 hours
- Collected flow-through for analysis
Group 1
VioA chip, VioB chip and VioE chip
Group 2
VioA chip, Blank chip, VioE chip
Group 3
VioA chip, VioB chip, Blank chip
Group 4
Blank chip, Blank chip, Blank chip
