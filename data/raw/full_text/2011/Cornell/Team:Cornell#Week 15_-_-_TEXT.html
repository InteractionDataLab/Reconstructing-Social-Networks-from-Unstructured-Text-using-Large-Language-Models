Monday, September 12
Afternoon lab work done by: Nancy Li, Charlie Chung
Prepared ten 3mL LB cultures (with 3µL carbenicillin) of colonies picked from plates dated Sept 3
- RFP + AviTagged pZE12 in DH5α
- VioA + AviTagged pZE12 in DH5α
- VioB + AviTagged pZE12 in DH5α
- VioE + AviTagged pZE12 in DH5α
- RFP + AviTagged pZE12 in MC4100
- VioA + AviTagged pZE12 in MC4100
- VioB + AviTagged pZE12 in MC4100
- VioE + AviTagged pZE12 in MC4100
- Control tube is just a colony with pZE12 (no insert gene)
- LB with carbenicillin (no inoculation with bacteria)
Incubating at 37°C in the shaker at Weill Hall
Cultures are to be lysed for release of natively biotinylated RFP and Vio enzymes in characterizing streptavidin-coated microfluidics chips
Did not extensively search for L-tryptophan (starting substrate in the synthesis of prodeoxyviolacein) in the reagents shelf of our Weill Lab space, but does not appear to be in plain view (may be tucked away in an obscure corner?)
Tuesday, September 13
Afternoon lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Objective: Transfer yesterday's 3mL starter culture into today's larger scale culture (20mL LB + 20µL ampicillin)
Autoclaved two 1L LB at 1:30pm (~1.5 hour cycle)
Claire's batch of five autoclaved 250mL flasks are ready for use
Prepared stock solution of 1000x ampicillin (100mg/mL)
- Weigh out 1g ampicillin sodium salt (Sigma)
- Dissolve in 10mL ddH2O
- Syringe filter (0.22µm membrane) the ampicillin solution
Stored in the bottom shelf of Weill Lab refrigerator (it's in a 15mL conical -- will later aliquot into Eppendorfs)
Evening lab work done by: Claire Paduano
Prepared cultures of AviTagged VioA, VioB, VioE and RFP in 20mL LB with 20µL ampicillin
Left in 37°C shaker to culture

Transformation via Electroporation
Add 1.0µL DpnI to each PCR reaction
Incubate in thermocycler at 37°C for 1 hour
After incubation, transform PCR product into electrocompetent cells

- (VioB + AviTag) into DH5α
- (VioE + AviTag) into DH5α

Plated transformed products of PCR deletion technique on VioA, VioB, and VioE using ampicillin-treated agar plates
Afternoon microfluidics work done by: Maneesh Gupta
Tested effect of fluorescein with lysate on streptavidin-biotin binding to see if lysate interferes with their affinity
- Used 5:1 ratio of lysate to fluorescein
- Chips used in the experiment were coated yesterday (streptavidin is 1 day old)
- Flow rate = 1µL/min for 50 minutes
- Tested chips "Aaaaahhh" and "Chippy". Test chip was "Aaaahhh" which contained lysate + fluorescein. "Chippy"  ::   contained lysate. Stored both chips in fridge with DI water. Pictures taken with chips filled in air.
Tested chip "stardust" with fluorescein two days after it was coated with streptavidin. Stored in DIwater in fridge.
- Flow rate = 5µl/min for 20min. pics taken in air.

Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Archana Rachakonda
Desalted the light-lysis + pSB1C3 ligation and control on a membrane for 15 minutes.
Transformed the desalted samples into DH5α cell lines through electroporation and put them into 37°C shaker for 90 minutes.
Afternoon lab work done by: Jim Mathew, Claire Paduano, Charlie Chung
Plates for transformation products of PCR-deletion technique did not grow colonies
- Arced electroporation & transport of plates from Weill to Olin in 40°C weather immediately after plating
- Will retry the PCR tomorrow (Saturday, September  17)
Plated the (light-lysis + pSB1C3) and control (pSB1C3 only) transformation products on agar treated with chloramphenicol
- Incubating at 37°C in Olin 303
Saturday, September 17
Morning lab work done by: Jim Mathew, Claire Paduano
Frustrating News -- Checking for Growth of Transformed Products
- Very few colonies of (light-lysis + pSB1C3) grew
- Equal or greater number of colonies grew on the Control (pSB1C3 only) plate
