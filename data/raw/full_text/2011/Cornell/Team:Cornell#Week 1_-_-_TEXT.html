Weill Hall Lab Space Introduction by Dr. Archer
Cornell iGEM Bootcamp Training Session (Day 2)
1. Set up ligation reaction using 50-100ng of backbone and 1:3 ratio of insert to backbone. Put at room temperature for 2 hours.
2. Desalt the ligation samples on a membrane.
3. Electroporate the samples in the electrocompetent cells.
4. Shake the cells in 37°C shaker for 1 hour.
5. Plate the cells onto the agar plate treated with the appropriate antibiotic. Incubate it overnight at 37°C.
