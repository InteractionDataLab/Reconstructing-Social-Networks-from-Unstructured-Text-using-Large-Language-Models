Lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Picked Colonies: four (40mL LB + 40µL ampicillin) cultures shaking at 37°C
- AviTagged GFP
- AviTagged VioA from PCR deletion
- AviTagged VioB from PCR deletion
- AviTagged VioE from PCR deletion
Thursday, October 13
Lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Picking Colonies
(40mL LB + 40µL ampicillin) culture of empty pZE12 vector as a negative control shaking at 37°C
Miscellaneous
Freshly made 1000x ampicillin and 1M IPTG are in the DNA cryobox of Olin 301 (-20°C fridge)
Subculturing of AviTagged Vio Enzymes
20mL from 40mL cultures of VioA, B, E were transferred to (1L LB + 1mL ampicillin) flask for a 1:50 dilution
- Wanted OD to be between 0.05-0.08 after a 2-3hr incubation period, but accidentally let it grow over to 0.1xx
- Regardless, induced with 1mL 1M IPTG
(*EDIT*): Supposed to be a 0.1µM induction with IPTG, so should have added 100µL and not 1000µL to a 1000mL culture. Overinducing may lead to insoluble fractions.
- Shaking at room temp in Olin 301 for 20+ hours until 6pm on Friday (when we'll spin the cells down)
Subculturing of AviTagged GFP
two 10mL from 40mL culture of GFP were transferred to two (500mL LB + 500µL ampicillin) flasks for a 1:50 dilution
- Wanted OD to be 0.05-0.08 after a 2-3hr incubation period, but accidentally let it grow over to 0.1xx
- Regardless, induced with 500µL 1M IPTG
(*EDIT*): Supposed to be a 0.1µM induction with IPTG, so should have added 50µL and not 500µL to a 500mL culture. Overinducing may lead to insoluble fractions.
- Shaking at room temp in Olin 301 for 20+ hours until 6pm on Friday (when we'll spin the cells down)
Preparing Freezer Stocks
Took 500µL from remainder of the 40mL cultures and added 500µL of 30% glycerol to create freezer stocks of GFP and VioA, B, E
- In -80°C freezer of Olin 303
Preparation for Sequencing Confirmation of GFP and Vio Colonies
Miniprep purification of 5mL from remainder of the 40mL cultures. Eluted products are in -20°C fridge. To be submitted for sequencing
Friday, October 14
Lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Subculturing of Negative Control (empty pZE12 vector)
Transfer two 10mL samples from 40mL culture of empty pZE12 vector to two (500mL LB + 500µL ampicillin) flasks for a 1:50 dilution
Incubate overnight on 37°C shaker in Olin 304
Protein Extraction of GFP and VioA, B, E
Spin down 1L cultures into a pellet (10 min at 3200rpm)
Resuspend in 20mL autoclaved water
Transfer to 50mL conical tube and spin for 10 min at 3200rpm
Store in -80°C freezer
Western Blot Preparation
Centrifuge 1.5mL of GFP and VioA, B, E cultures for 10 min at 14,000rpm
BugBuster will be used for protein extraction
Saturday, October 15
Afternoon lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Preparation of Starter Cultures for pZE12 Vector and Vio Enzymes
Used freezer stocks to inoculate (5mL LB + 5µL ampicillin) cultures of empty pZE12 vector and VioA, B, E
Shaking in 37°C incubator of Olin 304
Lysate Extraction of E. coli with Empty pZE12 Vector -- Negative Control
Spin down 1L culture into pellets (10 min at 3200rpm; next time do longer and faster spin)
Stored in -20°C fridge of Olin 303
