Team:Cornell/Modo
From 2011.igem.org
Choosing Modo
Before     CUGEM, the animation team members collectively had prior experience with     Solidworks and Photoview 360. Photoview 360 provided a fast and effective     photorealistic rendering solution. Looking for the company that produced     Photoview 360, the team came across Modo, a relatively new modeling,     UV-mapping, texturing, animation, and rendering suite.
 
The team     discussed the capabilities of both, and over the period of two weeks     (6/10/2011-6/24/2011) experimented and learned the basic capabilities of each.     During this period, the team used the trial version of Modo.
 
Week of 6/10/2011: Getting to Know the Basics
Tested Components:
Modeling
Animation
Visual Rendering Quality
 
Modeling:
As a result of Luxology's partnership with Dassault Systèmes Solidworks     Corp., Modo allowed for the direct importing of Solidworks models. For a team     with prior knowledge of Solidworks, this was a valuable asset - all     microfluidic chip and "hard" surface models could be used quickly and     easily in scenes.

For organic modeling, modo proved extremely capable. The software has a     very natural feeling toolset - all tools take the 3 core manipulations of     rotation, scaling, and translation and apply them to user-picked selections     with various customizable weights. Combined with Modo's powerful subdivision     surface support, the polygon mesh becomes a piece of puddy.

In modeling biological systems, Modo offered an incredibly useful tool:     the replicator. Replicators provide a simple method for creating huge masses of     low-resource instances from a single model. Luxology describes it as     "instancing on steroids." Implications? With replicators a single     protein can quickly become  a cloud of     2000. And that cloud can quickly be animated to move, scale, and rotate     organically.
 
Getting used to the controls was initially tricky, but became very     natural very fast.
 
Animation:
Animation in modo is built upon keyframing channels. The team had prior     experience with animation programs Jahshaka and Flash - there was no real     struggle with the basic features.
 
Modo also includes a variety of vertex map deformers. The simplest,     called morph map deformers, allowed for smooth transitions between organically     "morphed" pieces.
 
Modo's animation toolset also included rigging - linking object     channels together in a "rig" so that a minimal amount of keyframes     needed to be set in order to achieve a desired movement or output.
Basic example: rigging y-direction translation of a cup with the     y-rotation of a dish will cause the dish to rotate about the y-axis as the cup     is moved in the y-direction.
 
As a first test, the team animated and rendered a few basic shapes and     preset items. Texturing was applied using presets.
 
 
Visual Rendering Quality:
Looking through modo's website, end results were extremely impressive.
However, aiming to see what could be done with minimal knowledge, the     team experimented with a variety of Solidworks models (from previous projects     before iGEM), as well as basic organic models created in modo.

The team was very impressed. Applied materials were still presets for     the most part.
A custom material was attempted on a painted face-man.
 
Some work was still needed to fully understand the material and     UV-texturing system, but the animation team was satisfied with these     preliminary results.
 
First Real Test:
In order to showcase the potential of Modo, the team created a     preliminary animation.
Unfortunately the mechanical engineer who made the animation did not     yet fully understand our project at the time of making.
A cell morphs, lyses, and drops a "protein." The     "protein" looks like an ecoli shaped piece of gum and flies through     the conceptual model of the team's microfluidic device.
 
 
Reception and Review:
Created after less than a week with Modo, the animation was greeted     with a very positive reception by the rest of the team.
 
The animation team was given the go-ahead to proceed with the software.

Made during the last days of our trial, during these preliminary     stages.
Made for a nice intro to a presentation.
