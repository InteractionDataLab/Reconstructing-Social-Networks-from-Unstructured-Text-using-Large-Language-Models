August 14th - August 20th
Sunday, August 14
Afternoon lab work done by: Charlie Chung
Picked three colonies from the two (GFP + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) plates
- GFP + AviTag + BB (1) #1, 2, 3
- GFP + AviTag + BB (2) #1, 2, 3
Incubating overnight in 37°C shaker of Room 304
Re-picked three colonies from the (RFP + AviTagged pZE12 backbone) plate in order to retry subculturing, induction, and cell lysis
- RFP + AviTag + BB #7, 8, 9
Incubating overnight in 37°C shaker of Room 304
Monday, August 15
Afternoon lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Maneesh Gupta
Objective
Miniprep GFP samples that were cultured overnight and send them off for sequencing
Set up the PCR for VioB using the Vio operon
Miniprep & Sequencing
Miniprepped the GFP samples using standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol
GFP + AviTag + pZE12 backbone (1)- 1,2,3
GFP + AviTag + pZE12 backbone (2)- 1,2,3
Set up the samples for sequencing using the reverse primer
Order Number: 10254977
PCR Reaction
Set up the VioB PCR using the Vio operon (= 20.3ng/μL).
As Didi suggested, used the melting temperature of 53°C and annealing time for 3:30 minutes.
Evening lab work done by: Maneesh Gupta, Charlie Chung
Preparing a Subculture
Set up two cuvettes for preliminary optical density (OD) reading: (1) control (2) RFP sample from Sunday evening
- Purpose of preliminary OD reading is to determine how much RFP sample you need to add to a new 25mL culture
- Use a 1:10 dilution of sample to minimize error when running the spectrophotometer
Control: 1000µL LB
RFP Sample: 900µL LB + 100µL (RFP + AviTagged pZE12) Colony #9
RFP Sample OD = 0.329 (treat as [bacteria with RFP]), which translates to actual OD of 3.29 in Sunday's 3mL culture tube (after undoing the 1:10 dilution)
Use dilution equation to determine how much RFP bacteria culture is needed for the 25mL culture
(3.29)(? µL) = (desired beginning [RFP bacteria] = 0.05)(25mL = 25000µL)
? = 380µL Sunday's RFP bacteria culture to 25mL LB + 25µL ampicillin
Incubate new 25mL RFP bacteria subculture in 37°C shaker for ~2 hours and 45 minutes (6:30pm start)
At end of incubation time, check OD. Target OD = 0.6-0.8, which means ready for induction of RFP production via IPTG
OD was 0.49 at 9pm. Let culture grow until 11pm for induction (IPTG addition).
Induce 25mL RFP bacteria culture with 25µL 1M IPTG for desired 1mM addition (completed at 11pm)
Incubate induced 25mL culture flask on room temperature shaker
Tuesday, August 16
Afternoon lab work done by: Maneesh Gupta, Charlie Chung
Repeated cell lysis protocol (see Saturday, August 13) on 25mL culture from Monday.
- However, after centrifuging, the pellet was not red
Troubleshooting Possibilities
RFP being expressed in such little quantity that it cannot be confirmed by the naked eye
- Instead, RFP expression can be confirmed with a western blot on the cell lysate using an antibody for biotin
Distance between the ribosomal binding site (RBS) and the AUG start codon of the RFP mRNA may be too long
- Redesign primers for the sake of cloning and expressing RFP
What We Did
- Picked a culture sample from the pellet formed after the centrifuge step
- Incubated in the 37°C shaker of Room 304 for Miniprep and sequencing tomorrow
p.s. -- Submit Didi's sequencing samples along with RFP sample!
Wednesday, August 17
Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
Miniprep DNA Plasmid Purification
Miniprepped culture from bacterial cell pellet of (RFP + AviTagged pZE12)
- Followed standard Qiagen Miniprep protocol
- NanoDrop spectrophotometry: 52.7ng/μL
Preparation for DNA Sequencing Submission
- 1μL reverse primer for pZE12
- 17μL Miniprep-purified (RFP + AviTagged pZE12)
Order Number: 10255141
Thursday, August 18
Friday, August 19
Lab work done by: Claire Paduano, Youjin Cho
Objective
PCR clean up VioB insert
Digest VioB insert and VioE in AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone and gel purification
GFP sequencing came back: unsuccessful. PCR off GFP overnight to try ligation again
Digestion Setups
VioE in AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
19.05μL H2O
23.2μL VioE in AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone (2μg)
5μL 10x NEBuffer 2
0.5μL 100x BSA
1.25μL KpnI
1μL HindIII
50μL Total
VioB insert
38.25μL H2O
4μL VioB(1μg)
5μL 10x NEBuffer 2
0.5μL 100x BSA
1.25μL KpnI
1μL HindIII
50μL Total
KpnI has only 75% efficiency in Buffer 2, so added 0.25uL more KpnI to digestion mixture
Incubate in 37°C water bath for 2 hours
Gel Purification of VioB Insert and AviTagged pZE12 Vector Backbone
VioB: 5.4ng/uL
AviTagged backbone: 11.4ng/uL
Saturday, August 20
Morning lab work done by: Claire Paduano
Objective
Set up ligation of VioB in AviTagged backbone
Ligation
VioB + AviTagged Backbone
2.3μL AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
14.7μL VioB
0.0μL H2O
2.0μL T4 DNA ligase buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA ligase
20μL Total
In all above reactions, volume of plasmid vector added corresponds with 100ng backbone
Prepare control ligation reactions (inserts replaced with H2O) for each of the above constructs
Same volume of vector backbone, buffer, ligase
Volumes of all inserts (i.e. gene) go toward volume of H2O
After ligation setup, incubate at room temperature for 4 hours
Afternoon lab work done by: Youjin Cho, Charlie Chung
VioB Transformation
Desalted the (VioB + AviTag + BB) ligation reaction product and the AviTagged backbone control
Transformed (VioB + AviTag + BB) and the (AviTagged BB) control into DH5α bacteria via electroporation
Plated onto (LB + ampicillin) dishes and incubated overnight at 37°C
Alternative Method for RFP Expression
Sequencing results from Wednesday's (August 17) sample show that the RFP gene was present in the AviTagged pZE12 vector backbone
Transformed 1.5μL of (RFP + Avi-Tag + BB) Miniprep-purified plasmid into DH5α bacteria with the IPTG gene via electroporation
- Ideal Results: Colonies that have grown tomorrow will be red because RFP-production is constitutively on
Plated onto a (LB + ampicillin) dish and incubated overnight at 37°C
