Biofactory Trailer
Original Description
"Something Cool for the     Website"
 
Creative Process:
After receiving the original description, wanted to make a trailer that     incorporated the following elements:
The iGEM bacteria          logo
Biofactory text made          of proteins
An fun journey for          the audience
Giant flying text          reminiscent of that from Toy Story 2 and 3
Some point during the week (7/23/2011 - 07/27/2011), vision hit. Established scene     description.
 
Trailer Description:
"The audience flies towards an     iGEM bacteria in the distance. On the way, they fly through two giant 3-D words     introducing the scene: "CUiGEM" "Presents". As they get closer to the cell, proteins     within it begin to move, and the gears begin to glow and spin faster. Upon     entering, the audience enters a world filled of motion. The proteins assemble     into big words "Biofactory". The gears spin     violently. Ambient protein particles get buffeted around."
 
Rationale:
 iGEM bacteria represented     half-biological engineered means with which to assemble desired stuff.
When the audience approaches the bacteria, they "activate"     the system, resulting in light, motion and ultimately the biofactory text.
 
The light can be thought of as triggered by audience (human presence,     interaction). And the biofactory assembly triggered by light, as it is in our     actual project.
 
Summary of Scene Progression:
Full Draft Trailer Scene  (07/23/2011 - 07/27/2011):
Scene developed over the course of a week. Very few hitches. Result was     satisfactory first time around.
Component Production:
iGEM          bacteria - created in Modo using iGEM logo png as sketch basis.
Giant text - created          in SolidWorks, imported and animated in Modo.
Fun journey for the          audience - curve-guided camera in Modo.
Biofactory Text -          created in Modo. Modeled proteins and replicated into Biofactory alpha          channel stencil.
 
Planned Modifications:
 none
 
Reception and Review:
Extremely positive. Team added music and uploaded trailer to the     website.
