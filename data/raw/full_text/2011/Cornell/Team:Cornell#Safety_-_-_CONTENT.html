We stringently followed all relevant safety protocols, and our project poses little to no threat to the safety of researchers, the public, and the environment.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Material_Safety">Material Safety</SPAN></H2><P><B>Researcher Safety</B>
Working in a laboratory can be dangerous if protocols are not followed correctly. To minimize this risk, researchers were trained in laboratory safety modules as described in the Biosafety Provisions section below. Potentially dangerous chemicals that we used were: ethidium bromide (EtBr; to visualize DNA bands in agarose gels) and SU-8 photoresist and developer (to construct the mask used to make our microfluidic device). 
</P><DL><DD><UL><LI><B>Ethidium bromide:</B> All researchers were required to wear nitrile gloves when handling EtBr. After handling toxic chemicals, researchers were required to discard contaminated items such as gloves to prevent the spread of contamination. Gels containing EtBr were properly discarded in a biohazard bin. When viewing gels, exposure to UV light was minimized through the use of UV-protective safety masks covering the eyes and face.

</LI><LI><B>SU-8 developer and photoresist:</B> During construction of our microfluidic mask in the clean room, SU-8 photoresist and SU-8 developer were handled in a ventilated hood. Researchers were required to wear gloves, lab coats, and safety goggles at all times. SU-8 photoresist and developer were discarded in the proper disposal containers.

</LI><LI><B>Flammable liquids:</B> Flammable chemicals were stored in the flammable closet and handled in a fume hood away from fire. Chemicals were disposed of in the proper receptacles according to Weill Hall's safety requirements.  These chemicals included acetone and IPA (to rinse SU-8 developer) and ethanol (to sterilize and dilute streptavidin coating reagents). 
</LI></UL></DD></DL><P>General safe lab practices were followed in order to ensure researcher safety. Researchers were required to wear nitrile gloves and close-toed shoes during all laboratory work. 
</P><P><B>Public Safety</B>
It is a common misconception that bacterial strains used in research are dangerous to public health and safety. However, the bacteria we used, DH5a electrocompetent <I>E. coli</I>, are non-pathogenic and unlikely to survive outside of the laboratory. To insure minimal risk to public safety, bacteria were killed with 10% bleach before disposal. We perceive no potential threat to public safety from our project. The biochemical pathway we used converts tryptophan, a common amino acid found in many foods, to prodeoxyviolacein, a green pigment. Both chemicals and all intermediates are non-toxic and should present no threat to public health or safety. Furthermore, to prevent contamination of public areas, no gloves were allowed to leave the laboratory.
</P><P><B>Environmental Safety</B>
Our project poses no identifiable threat to environmental safety. As stated above, the DH5a E. coli used in our project are not able to survive outside the lab, and all cells were disposed of safely after disinfection with 10% bleach. Bio-hazardous and flammable chemicals were disposed of by following the proper regulations, as stated above. No gloves were allowed to leave the laboratory, so chemical and biological hazards were restricted to the laboratory.
</P><P><B>Security Risk</B>
We perceive no threat to security from our project. The final product of our biochemical pathway is a harmless pigment which cannot be used with malicious intent. Additionally, our BioFactory, a microfluidic device, is simply a tool to cut costs of synthesis in an industry setting.  It does not present any new security threat despite its potential to be misused.
</P><P><B>BioBrick Safety</B>
None of the BioBricks submitted to the registry raised any safety concerns. The we worked with are GFP, RFP, VioA, VioB, and VioE, all attached to avitags. These BioBricks are made from Bricks that already exist in the registry, and the addition of the avitag--which allows proteins to be tethered to channels in our microfluidic device--does not raise safety issues. Additionally, our last BioBrick, the light lysis package, causes cells to lyse in the presence of green light; it should not raise any safety concerns. </P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Biosafety_Provisions">Biosafety Provisions</SPAN></H2><P><B>Biosafety Rules and Procedures</B>
We complied with Weill Hall’s safety requirements in gaining access to laboratory space, as well as in use of the laboratory. All safety information and procedures are linked on the main Weill safety page <A href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/whfs/weill-hall-safety-links-and-information/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</A>. </P><P><B>Weill Hall Safety Personnel</B>
Scott D. Emr is Weill Hall's director.  There is also a Weill Hall Safety Committee.  We met often with Dr. Shivaun Archer, who manages our lab space, the Weill Hall BME Instructional Lab.  Dr. Archer introduced us to the laboratory space and reviewed safety procedures.  Dr. Archer also ensured that we constructed our microfluidic masks safely.
</P><P><B>Safety Training</B>
We received safety training from two online courses that all members were required to pass in order to gain laboratory access:  Lab Safety and Chemical Waste Disposal from Cornell Environmental Health and Safety. We also received training from Dr. Archer on basic safety issues such as waste disposal and use of the fume hood.
