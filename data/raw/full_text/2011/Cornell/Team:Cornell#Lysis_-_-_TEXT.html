Lysis Scene
 
Original Description:
Beaker          of cells floating. Zoom into cells. Watch them float around  briefly and zoom close up to one. Show          green beams of light
Zoom          out to edge of cell. Small rod-shaped surface proteins pepper  surface then aggregate into rings. Cell          bulges, inflates, and bursts  like a          balloon.
Zoom          out as multiple cells burst.
 
Interpreted Components:
E. Coli          Model
Cell Wall           - needs to be able to disintegrate.
Protoplasm - needs           maintain shape within cell wall.
Surface          Protein Coating
Surface           Proteins - appearance.
Coating Pattern
Explosion          Technique
Bursting           Effect.
Light          Source
Show           green color and purpose without being too intrusive.
 
Summary of Component Development:
Cell Wall
Created           Mesh of E. coli and sculpted it with a mesh of protoplasm underneath in order to           maintain consistency in cell wall spacing. Also sculpted morph maps to show           wall "gaining holes." At this point in the project, our skills were very           limited. We had no viable nice way to explode this.
Replicator Coating -           an actual cell wall. Designed by coating the protoplasm mesh with           thousands of individual "platelet" meshes. With a surface           generator and vertex map deformers, we were able to manipulate it very           nicely. Individual platelets also helped give E. coli a more life-like appearance.
Protoplasm
Created a           mesh of protoplasm underneath cell wall. Worked on appearance. Team           leader requested a "wispy" protoplasm; Although cell wall mesh           was scratched, protoplasm mesh was very usable and underwent vertex map           deformation in sync with its replicator cell wall shell.
Surface          Proteins
Modeled a           stand-in protein model in Modo, texturing with a modified version of Yazan           Malkosh's electron microscope texture. The team liked appearance of this model.
Coating          Pattern
We used           vertex map deformers for the coating pattern - it took several attempts to get this step right.
Explosion          Technique:
Experimented           with "gooey" and "hard" explosions for meshes, but were not           satisfied with the results.
Experimented with           dynamics package. However, this method is far too resource intensive. Thus, we decided that replicator           techniques would be more effective.
Finally, we used a           combination of vertex map deformers and morph maps on all replicators and           meshes. After several renditions --> We settled on "pop and expand"           rendition.
Beams of          Light:
Started           using volumetric  direction light           sources, but didn't quite like the result. After experimentation, we settled on           volumetric point light source with light shift over time. This strategy gives the           scene an effective "Sun"
 
 
Summary of Scene Progression
For the lysis scene, our team's Modo skill set was     still being developed. As a result, this scene involved a good amount of trial and     error with various scene rewrites.
Pure Mesh Attempt. (06/26/2011 - 07/03/2011)
 Looked very nice in stills, but scratched     before significantly animated.
1st Draft - Concept visualization. (07/03/2011 - 07/10/2011)
Created two animation models for the major elements of the     scene.
The first illustrated replicator offset explosions with  holes in the cell wall. This animation had a positive reception from the team.
The second showcased surface protein patterns and     deformations. This version needed some critiquing - discussed the effect of rings vs. globs.
2nd Draft - Flagella, Scale Up + Replicator explosion. (07/10/2011          - 07/11/2011)
The draft resulted from an experiment with flagella. Here, the protoplasm mesh is     coated with a cell wall replicator that does not deform. So, scaling up the     protoplasm resulted in the expansion and "disintegration" of the cell     wall. Flagellum was dynamically parented to protoplasm for smooth motion weight     gradient. This draft was met with a positive reception, but the team decided to cut the flagellum for     next rendition. This rendition also did not include surface proteins, which we had originally planned to include.
3rd Draft - 1st Full Assembly. (07/11/2011 - 07/15/2011)
Rebuilt the scene using feedback and lessons from previous renditions.
Visual          Overhaul: Used edited version of Yazan Malkosh's electron microscope          texture for cell wall platelets
Updated and refined          vertex map deformers.
Refined          explosion to include organic scaling of bacteria and post-explosion          swirling of cell wall platelets and expansion of protoplasm.
 
This draft met mostly positive reception. Our team leader wanted more prominent     "spikey" deformations at holes, and more of a "bursting" explosion.     Consensus  - camera work made bacteria     appear to shrink, which was not our original intention. Additionally, we still needed to implement surface protein layers.
4th Draft - 2nd Full Assembly. (07/15/2011 - 07/20/2011)
Refined scene
Rebuilt          and implemented surface protein vertex map deformers. Protein visuals          updated.
Implemented changes          to hole deformations. More of a spikey look.
Modified camera work.
Refined          Explosion - aimed for the effect of a more solid pop and burst.
Updated green light          source
Changed protoplasm to          a less resource intensive material.
 
This version was welcomed with positive reception. Of our drafts, these results were most satisfactory. Some comments that     holes were too spikey, but overall this was a very successful rendition of the scene.
At present, may correct the spikiness of holes, but this is low on the priority list.
Experimental Methods. (08/08/2011 - present)
Never           implemented in-scene: Post-2nd full assembly,  developed a technique for nicer cell           wall disintegration around holes. However, this technique would involve a complete           rebuild of the scene. We plan to implement this technique for a cleaner disintegration if there is time.
 
Reception and Review: Satisfactory.     Potentially, the scene could use some slight improvements - namely     "spikes" and the end protoplasm appearance. Otherwise, the current result is     nicely polished.
