In all above reactions, volume of plasmid vector added corresponds with 100ng backbone
Prepare control ligation reactions (no inserts) for each of the above constructs
Same volume of vector backbone, buffer, ligase
Volumes of all inserts (i.e. gene or primer pairs) go toward volume of H2O
After ligation setup, incubate in 16°C water bath overnight

Morning lab work done by: Youjin Cho, James Mathew
Set up digestion reaction for VioE, pZE12 (backbone) cut with KpnI and SphI
Afternoon lab work done by: James Mathew, Charlie Chung
Objective
Ligate the digested gene for the VioE enzyme (now with the appropriate sticky ends) onto the pZE12 vector backbone for future AviTag insertion
Interpret sequencing results and plan out next steps accordingly
NanoDrop Concentrations of Miniprep Purification Products
19.7ng/μL = pZE12 vector backbone cut with KpnI-HF and SphI-HF (HF = high fidelity)
26.8ng/μL = VioE gene cut with KpnI-HF and SphI-HF
(VioE + Backbone) Ligation Reaction Mixture
7.6μL pZE12 vector backbone cut with KpnI-HF and SphI-HF
5.9μL H2O
3.5μL VioE gene (insert)
2.0μL 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer
1.0μL T4 DNA ligase
20μL Total
Incubate in 16°C water bath overnight.
NOTE: Forgot to treat pZE12 vector backbone with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) for removal of 5' phosphate groups on the plasmid. Because noisy background of self-ligated pZE12 (without VioE gene insert) will be likely, will probably ignore the ligation product.
Sequencing Results
The nucleotide sequence of (GFP + Backbone) & (AviTag + Backbone) ligation constructs indicate that GFP and AviTag have independently been inserted into the pZE12 plasmid backbone.
Peculiar that the rest of the ligation constructs returned "noisy or failed" sequencing results because all the plates of bacteria transformed with the ligation product are at least two times more confluent than their corresponding control plates.
Pick Colonies & Bacterial Culture
Transferred the successful colony of (AviTag + Backbone) to a 25mL culture flask (incubating at 37°C in Room 304)
Despite a noisy sequencing result of (VioE + AviTag + Backbone), the plate shows significantly more growth than its control plate.
Picked three colonies and transferred to individual 5mL culture tubes (incubating at 37°C in Room 304)
