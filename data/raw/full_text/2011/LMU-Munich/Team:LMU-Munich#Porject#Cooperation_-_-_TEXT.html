In order to test our Primer Design method we cooperated with the University of Washington in Seattle. They tested the tool and gave us valueable feedback regarding existing bugs and the usability of the tool. Visit the wiki of the 2011 UW team
Our other collaboration partner is the "Technische Unviversität München" . Visit their wiki !
