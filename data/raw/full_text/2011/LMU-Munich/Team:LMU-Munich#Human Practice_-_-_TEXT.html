Workshops about Synthetic Biology
During the last years surveys were a common part of human practice. Mostly they dealt with the knowledge about synthetic biology or molecular biology in general. Results suggest that many concerns that people have are due to their ignorance. To provide consolidated knowledge we designed a workshop that can be worked trough in one afternoon.
More information about our workshops can be found here!
School Project
Since 2010, students of secondary schools (Gymnasium) in Bavaria have a new course during their two last school years. This course includes cooperations with external partners.
Our aim is to cooperate with schools in Munich in order establish Synthetic Biology as one of the possible electives.
More information about our school project can be found here.
