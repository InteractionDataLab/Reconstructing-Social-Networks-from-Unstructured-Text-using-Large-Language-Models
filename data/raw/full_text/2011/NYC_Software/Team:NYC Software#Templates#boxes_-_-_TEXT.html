Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.
