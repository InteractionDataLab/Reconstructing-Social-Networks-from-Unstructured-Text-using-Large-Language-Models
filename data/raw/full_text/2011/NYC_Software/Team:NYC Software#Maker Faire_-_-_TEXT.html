World Maker Faire 2011: NYC
We teamed up with the Columbia Cooper (Genspace) iGEM Team to host Synthetic Biology Workshops at the GenspaceNYC booth in the world Maker Faire in New York City from September 17-18. We worked with the public to help them learn about synthetic biology and standard assembly method employed by iGEM teams by introducing them to various synthetically engineered organisms. We also introduced visitors to various software tools used in iGEM projects and walk them through design and building of a rudimentary synthetic organism in-silico, with discussions on current limits of the technology and future possibilities.
