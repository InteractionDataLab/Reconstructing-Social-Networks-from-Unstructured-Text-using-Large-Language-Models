Genome Sequencing Experiments
The scale of genome sequencing is advancing rapidly every day due to increased accuracy, number of reads and read lengths produced by our sequencing technology. Thanks to a large donation of TruSeq DNA and RNA Sample Prep kits from our friends at Illumina, our adviser Russell is able to construct sequencing libraries for our Deinococcus strains to be run on the Illumina Hi-Seq system.
