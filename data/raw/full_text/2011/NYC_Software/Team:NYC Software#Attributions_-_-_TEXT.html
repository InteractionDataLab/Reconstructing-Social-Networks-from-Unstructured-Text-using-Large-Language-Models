Who did the work on our different projects:
Primer Designer
Hannah Landes coded the primer designer scripts in python after learning it at the beginning of the summer.
BLAST Tool
Balvir Kunar completely coded the BLAST programs from beginning to end.
Genome Sequence Analysis
While we arranged the delivery of our experimental Deinococcus strains, Russell Durrett prepared the sequencing libraries for them.
Russell also taught us how to analyze the coding sequences of the new genomes by going through the pipeline on the existing sequences. He helped us write the run_pipe.sh shell script to generate the data files, and then Sun won Lim generated the visualizations. The Mason Lab typically works with Human genomic data, so this project is substantially different from the research currently going on there.
