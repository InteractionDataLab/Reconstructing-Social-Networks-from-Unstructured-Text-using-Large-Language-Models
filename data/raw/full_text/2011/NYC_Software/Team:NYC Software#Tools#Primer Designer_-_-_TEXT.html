Biobricking Primer Designer
At the beginning of the summer our Wetware comrades were faced with the challenge of designing primers for over 50 future biobricks. In order to aid them, and of course future iGEMers, we developed a command line tool for creating primer sequences suitable for biobricking under RFC23 - the Silver Standard. The wetware team used this tool at the beginning of the summer and said it was 'indispensable'. This program affects human practices of synthetic biology by facilitating the construction of biobrick part design and construction.
The code for this program is available on the iGEM Software github repo: NYC SOFTWARE REPO
We are also working toward incorporating this primer designer into a web-based utility so you wont have to download it to use it. At the time of the wiki freeze we do not have this online, but check This Location to see our progress.
Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.
