Deinococcus
Deinococcus species are hardy gram-negative bacteria that can survive acute radiation exposures up to 10,000 Gray units of ionizing radiation. 5 Deinococcus species genomes' have been sequenced at this time, including Deinococcus radiodurans - the most infamous member of the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus that is so tough it's been named 'Conan the Bacterium'. We hope to expand the sequence information in this phylum and enable sequence similarity studies in the future.
