Registry/ Biobrick Tools
Our primary aim is to develop tools to make iGEM easier. We realize that three months is an incredibly short time to attempt ambitious synthetic biology projects, so we are working to code tools that will allow future iGEMers to develop their experimental plans more quickly. Our Primer Designer will take a given sequence and output the primers necessary to biobrick that part. When searching the Registry to see if your parts has been biobricked already, text searches turn out to be an inefficient way to find this information. Instead, perhaps you could use our BLAST Tool to search based on your parts' sequence instead of the arbitrary name humanity has given it.
Deinococcus Genome Sequencing
Our wetlab partner team's goal is to discover novel responses to radiation resistance in bacteria by cloning a lot of genes and testing them. We aim to aid that effort by sequencing the genomes of species of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus genus and to identify genes that may be responsible for increased protection against superoxide radicals and ionizing radiation. This is a pretty ambitious goal, but thanks to a large donation from Illumina and our location here in the Mason Lab at Weill Cornell we can make it happen.
Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli using whole genome analysis to compare frequencies of certain D.rad-related genes in experimental genomes.
Toolsets
The only way for the new field like synthetic biology to grow is to make it easier for new entrants. We contribute to the field by developing tools that ease biobrick project design and allow iGEMers to take to the wetlab more quickly.
