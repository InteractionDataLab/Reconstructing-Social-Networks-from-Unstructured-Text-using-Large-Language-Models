NYC Wetware - Our Partners In Crime
Our iGEM efforts are inextricably bound to the NYC Wetware teams'. We brainstormed our projects together every step of the way and they provided useful insights into what software tools may make it easier to do iGEM projects.
Sequencing Stanford iGEM's Construct
The Stanford / NASA iGEM Team needed to sequence a very large ~10kb cassette for their project. We arranged to have our adviser Russell prepare sequencing libraries for the PacBio sequencer to help them out.
Columbia Cooper - Maker Faire Partners
We teamed up with the Columbia-Cooper iGEM Team to present Synthetic Biology workshops at the 2011 NYC World Maker Faire. Our group even ended up winning the Make Magazine Editors' Choice Award!
