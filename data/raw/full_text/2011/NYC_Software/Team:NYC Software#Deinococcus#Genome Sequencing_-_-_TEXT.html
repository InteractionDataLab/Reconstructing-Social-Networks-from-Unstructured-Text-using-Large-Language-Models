Deinococcus Genome Sequencing
We aimed to analyze novel genome sequences from a large, diverse set of Deinococcus bacteria collected from vastly different sources. We collaborated with Dr. Daly's group at the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences who sent us frozen pellets of cultures they had grown. Our adviser Russell prepared Illumina and PacBio sequencing libraries from DNA isolated from these pellets.
At the time of the wiki freeze we have 5 pilot libraries running on the Weill Cornell HiSeq:
