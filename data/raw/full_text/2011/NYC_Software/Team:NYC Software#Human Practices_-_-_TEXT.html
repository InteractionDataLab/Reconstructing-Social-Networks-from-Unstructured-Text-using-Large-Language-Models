World Maker Faire 2011: NYC
The NYC iGEM software team will be volunteering at the GenspaceNYC booth in the world Maker Faire in New York City from September 17-18. For the duration of the Maker Faire we will work with the public to help them learn about synthetic biology and standard assembly method employed by iGEM teams by introducing them to various synthetically engineered organisms. We'll also introduce visitors to various software tools used in iGEM projects and walk them through design and building of a rudimentary synthetic organism in-silico, with discussions on current limits of the technology and future possibilities.
