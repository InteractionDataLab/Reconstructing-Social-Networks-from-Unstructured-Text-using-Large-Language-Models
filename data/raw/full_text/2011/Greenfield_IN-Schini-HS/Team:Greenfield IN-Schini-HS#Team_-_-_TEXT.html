The Greenfield-Central School Corporation is proud to be one of the newest additions to the iGem community as well as a pioneer into the high school division. Our team has been formed from the Biomedical Innovations class at GCHS, which is the fourth year course of the Project Lead the Way Biomedical Sciences Academy.  In this capstone course, we apply our knowledge and skills gathered throughout our high school careers to answer questions or solve problems related to the biomedical sciences. We have designed innovative solutions for the health challenges of the 21st century as we worked through progressively challenging open-ended problems, addressing topics such as clinical medicine, physiology, biomedical engineering, and public health. We had the opportunity to work on an independent project with mentors or advisors from universities, hospitals, physician’s offices, or other industries. At the end of the course, we were expected to present our work to an adult audience that may include representatives from the local business and healthcare community. This is our first year being involved in iGEM and we hope to expand our team as well as the high school division as a whole.
