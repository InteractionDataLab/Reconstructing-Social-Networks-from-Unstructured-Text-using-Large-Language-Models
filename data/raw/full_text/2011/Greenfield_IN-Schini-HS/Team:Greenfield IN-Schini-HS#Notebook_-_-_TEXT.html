Team:Greenfield IN-Schini-HS/Notebook
From 2011.igem.org
Biomedical Innovation class of Greenfield-Central High School. In the class we study all the many innovations in the biomedical world, especially that of biomedical engineering. This is our first year in iGEM and we hope to expand our team as well as the high school division as a whole.  Our project is designed to utilize Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a method to detect arsenic in home water systems. Our goal is to enginner Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fluoresce when in the presence of arsenic. To accomplish this, we are inserting arsenic promoters in addition to GFPs into a plasmid which will then be placed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our project runs by the process of Gibson assemblage.
