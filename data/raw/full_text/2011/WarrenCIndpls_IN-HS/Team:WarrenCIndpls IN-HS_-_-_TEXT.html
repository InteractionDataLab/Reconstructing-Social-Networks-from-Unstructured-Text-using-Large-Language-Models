Team:WarrenCIndpls IN-HS
From 2011.igem.org
This team is a group of dedicated students who were chosen from the elite of the school. All of the students in the group have or is taking part in the Project Lead the Way Biomed program. The advisor for the team, A.J. McAdams carefully selected only those he believed would be able to participate and do well in the reasearch and development of this project.
Some bacteria have been genetically modified to detect certain metals in a water supply. However, it has not been done in yeast. If yeast is genetically engineered to do so, it would be a much safer procedure. The objective for was to create a bio-brick. The creation of the part will enable next year's team to complete the overall goal, which is to create and insert a plasmid into yeast that will cause it to glow red in the presence of a certain metal.
