Safety
There could be several safety issues that appear in the process of developing this project. They include but are not limited to: possible lawsuit or other consequence because of plagerism, sickness from E.Coli, and possible contamination of the facility and/or homes of the participants if the bacteria is allowed to be transfered by clothing or some other substance. All of these can be avoided however. If proper citaions are used, then the issue of plagerism is eliminated. Using proper aseptic technique would irradicate the problem of spreading the bacteria.
