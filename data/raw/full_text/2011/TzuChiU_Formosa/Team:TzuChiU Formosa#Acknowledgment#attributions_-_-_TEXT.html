Team:TzuChiU Formosa/Acknowledgment/attributions
From 2011.igem.org
We are proud to say that all the work was accomplished by the undergraduate
members of our iGEM team with mentorship from our advisors and professors.
A big, hearty thanks to all our instructors and advisors, for supervising us throughout
the project and keeping our team motivated and helping us in any way possible.
