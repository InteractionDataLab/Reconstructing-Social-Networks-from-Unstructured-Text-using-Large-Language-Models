From 2011.igem.org
On the journey of promoting synthetic biology, we're so lucky to have DaAi Radio
for helping us. We have done education on synthetic biology via one of the most
populat radio channel in Taiwan, DaAi Radio .
One of the staff was at our synthetic biology fair. She was impressed by
our idea and project, and hence arranged an interview with us.In the interview ,
we mainly discussed about synthetic biology, our university achievements and
also our current project. Our advisor, Eric Yang also shared his personal iGEM
experience with all the audience.
