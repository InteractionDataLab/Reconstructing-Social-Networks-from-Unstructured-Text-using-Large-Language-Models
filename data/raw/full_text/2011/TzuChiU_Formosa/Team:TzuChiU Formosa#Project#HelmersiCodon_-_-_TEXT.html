Abstract
Ever since the boom of the livestock industry, countless environmental issues such as methane emission and ecological damage arise. So far, livestock production occupies 70% of the total agricultural land, which roughly accounts for 30% of the Earth. In addition, the world is also facing a major water crisis. According to experts, by the year 2025, 64% of the earthlings would be living in water-scarce areas. The fact that the water used for livestock industry accounted for a massive 50% of the world’s water usage does not help in solving the issue. Greenhouse gas emissions of animal husbandry accounted for 18% of the total emission, even more than the carbon emission of transportation and logistics. Therefore, in order to resolve the issue, we came up with an idea of producing a new "food" that contains all the 8 essential amino acids. The gene ovalbumin will be embedded into plasmid pAMJ399, and the use of promoter p170 to perform gene expression in lactococcus lactis. When human consume lactococcus lactis, it will synthesize the protein to the outer membrane. Our aim is to regulate the synthesis of protein, and hopefully It will become a new source of protein.
