Synthetic Biology Fair
Date: 30th September 2011
Location: College of Life Sciences, Tzu Chi University
September is ending. In conjunction with the University ECA day, we also had posters exhibition showcasing our projects as well as those focusing on the subject of synthetic biology. Not only have our fellow school mates, even professors also interested in knowing our project. We share our stories our experiences to them. One team and one brilliant idea made up one great afternoon.
On the other hand, questionnaires were randomly distributed to 60 samples during the fair, result shows that 90% of them were thoroughly inspired by our idea and 10% of them even professed that they would like to join us again for the event next year! In a nutshell, the people in Tzu Chi University now have a better understanding on the subject Synthetic Biology!
