Description
We had design 8 biobricks for our project. Due to the long sequence of complete acs operon, we amplified the acsAB and acsCD gene respectively. BBa_K571000 is the first biobrick  with acsAB gene cloned into pSB1C3, BBa_K571003 is the second one with acsCD as insert. BBa_K571004 is an improved part from the existing biobrick BBa_R0011 . We added a RBS at the 5' end of the original sequence in order to get a better gene expression performance.
As to the composite biobricks, we tried a few times for different arrangement of the parts to get the most ideal one. BBa_K571005 was designed to work together with BBa_K571006 , as the former carries acsAB gene and the latter carries acsCD gene. Both of them were added the promoter( BBa_K571004 ) for gene expression after being induced by IPTG. BBa_K571007 and BBa_K571008 are biobricks with all elements cloned in them.
All of the biobricks have been tested to make sure that the clonings are successful. Modelling and system construction are still proceeding and improving.
Parts
New for iGEM 2010 is the groupparts tag.  This tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
