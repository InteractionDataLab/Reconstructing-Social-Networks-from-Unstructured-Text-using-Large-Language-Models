Meeting Minutes
2011.02.24
Discussion:
Team organization
Brain storming
paper made by bacteria with add-ons such as colors, fragrance, etc.
"light up" the plants for replacing lamp posts.
2011.03.04
Discussion:
Team advisory
Brain storming
Add-ons: colorful cellulose which produced by bacteria such as beta-carotene
information exchange with iGEM 2009 Cambridge team
2011.03.14
Discussion:
Task Allocation
Brain storming
Avatar - "light up" the plants by transfecting symbiotic bacteria which cloned into fluorescence gene
Eco-friendly warmer - biotic thermal pad
2011.03.23
Discussion:
Project : paperia
Option 1 : Culture bacteria which has pigment gene
Option 2 : Cellulose-producing bacteria secrete pigment into the medium
2011.03.24
Discussion:
Exp. procedure:
cloning of cellulose gene’s CDS
the product should operate within E. coli.
2011.06.22
Discussion:
Due to some unforseen reason, the team decided to change their project.
New project: Biojenny
-economical and humane way to produce paper in large quantities.
-yeast to be our host
2011.07.01
Discussion:
Freeze > grin > genome DNA isolation > Cloning = silk protein gene
2011.07.09
Discussion:
the connections between 3 silk proteins : Fibl Fibh P25
major proteins : H-chain, L-chain, P25
2011.07.15
Discussion:
Due to limited resources and techniques required, the team decided to switch back to the previous project. Paper making !
However it would be modified to be more innovative and creative.
2011.07.18
Discussion:
Latest project : Photo paper
cyanobacteria is designed as the host, cellulose made up of the glucose produced by cyanobacteria could be one of the main attraction of the project.
2011.07.23
Discussion:
system modification to overcome the problems arises during preliminary round
Biobricks from Tokyo 2010 team will be utilized
regulator promoter in order to regulate the secretion of cellulose to solve the aggregation of the bacteria
2011.09.15
Genome miniprep
Gluconacetobacter hansenii
2011.09.18
Gel/PCR DNA extraction
Gluconacetobacter hansenii
Protocols
