Plate Reader (Fluorescence Detection)
To measure the fluorescence of our biosensor, we are using a Tecan ® Infinite™ Microplate Reader on 96 well plates. The outer ring of the plate is filled with a blank solution, typically the growth media used for the sensor, to prevent evaporation of the other samples in the plate. Each plate reader experiment is run to keep the optical densities (ODs) of each well as similar as possible, however, the OD is corrected later in the analysis of the data. Each row on the plate is a different sample, and each was run in triplicate. Plate reader protocols may be found in the protocols section.

About the image: Typical plate reader setup to test the efficacy of our EtOH sensor. Each lane is a sample, which was run in triplicate. The outer ring is blank media to prevent evaporation of the center samples.
