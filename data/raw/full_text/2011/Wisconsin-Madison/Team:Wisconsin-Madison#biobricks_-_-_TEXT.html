Biobricks
BioBricks are DNA sequences with a standardized interface that allows for simple cut and paste construction of biological systems. The interface consists of six specific restriction enzyme sites that flank the DNA coding region upstream and downstream; Along with restriction sites, BioBrick parts are also cloned into a specific plasmid backbone. There are two classifications of BioBricks:  parts and devices. Parts are the basic constituents of larger systems that code for basic biological functions, and devices consist of multiple parts that work synergistically to serve a specific application.  In order to functionalize these BioBricks, they are implemented into living cells, most commonly E. coli bacterial cells. Every year, each iGEM team submits their standardized BioBricks to the iGEM parts registry ; this registry constitutes an open source library of synthetic biological parts that any future team can order and use for their project.
