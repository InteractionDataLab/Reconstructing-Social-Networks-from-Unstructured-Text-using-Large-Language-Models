Contributions and Attributions
For this project, all cloning, testing, and web design has been done by the 2011 Wisconsin-Madison iGEM team.
Parts originating from outside of the team and the registry include:
- exaDE, which was codon optimized and synthesized by order from GeneArt
- tagRFP, which was provided by our advisors' lab and was originally created by Evrogen
