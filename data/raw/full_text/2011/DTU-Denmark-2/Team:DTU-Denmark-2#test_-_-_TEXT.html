Making Molecular Biology Easier
We have designed a novel standardized assembly system, called “Plug 'n' Play with DNA” where ready to use biological parts can be gathered without the use of restriction enzymes and ligase. This will make cloning faster and assembly of expression vectors possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and Aspergillus niger ready to plug 'n' play. You can find more information about how this standard works here .
A Reporter System
As proof of concept we have created a reporter system that can be used for anything from monitoring gene expression to determination of protein localization. We expressed and localized fluorescence proteins in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans and the mammalian cell line U-2 OS with great success.
Flexibility
Standardization entails rigidity. Therefore we have written a guide that allows the researcher to customize the system, so proteins can be assembled seamless, multiple mutations can be introduced in one round of cloning etc. The only limitation to this is your creativity.
Applications
Here you can learn more about the numerous applications of the Plug’n’Play with DNA assembly standard and the research areas, where this system is especially advantageous.
Data Page
You can find an overview of our project on our Data Page . Here you also find our favorite submitted biobricks, and the biobricks we characterized during the summer.
Achievements
Designing a novel assembly standard and creating a reporter system for Aspergillus nidulans and mammalian cells are our main achievements. You can read more about our accomplishments on this page .
The Team
We are five girls that have been working on this project for three months with support from our three supervisors. You can learn more about us, and how we started an iGEM team on our Team Page .
