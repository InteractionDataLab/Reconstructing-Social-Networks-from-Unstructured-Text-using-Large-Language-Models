(Fire brigade and ambulance).</LI></UL><H3>PREVENTING ACCIDENTS</H3>
	Before using larger equipment such as autoclaves, gas bottles, etc. for the first time, you are required to contact the person in charge of the equipment for further instructions.

	The autoclaves are dangerous and must not be opened after 5 p.m. or before 8 a.m. Use the large, heat insulating gloves.

	Gas flasks must be chained.


	Before using chemicals etc. for the first time you are required to discuss safety and handling of waste with a person in charge (head of project or laboratory technician). All solutions are to be kept in bottles with labels stating the content, date, name, as well as safety symbols. (Some spray bottles are already marked with colour codes). Cold and deep freeze storage of chemicals as per instructions (marked on the bottle). You must always inform another person before entering the cold storage rooms and on your return. 
<H3>PERSONAL SAFETY OUTFIT</H3>
	Everybody must have his/her own personal protective spectacles and suitable working clothes (laboratory coats). Gloves are available from the technicians - check quality, durability, and use for your particular application. Please apply to the technicians for dust masks if required. Use the fume cupboards when necessary. For pipetting use pipette balls, syringes or automatic pipettes: Mouth pipetting is forbidden.
<H3>ORDER</H3><UL><LI>Outdoor clothing and other irrelevant personal belongings are not allowed in the laboratories. Use the lockers in the basement.</LI><LI>No eating, smoking or drinking is permitted in the laboratory.</LI><LI>Measuring instruments and permanent set ups or parts thereof must not be moved. It is important to leave your work place tidy and clean every day. Spillages at balances, centrifuges and other instruments as well as at benches and on floors are to be cleaned up immediately.</LI></UL><H3>SAFETY GLASSES</H3><UL><LI>	Safety glasses must be worn according to local safety rules.</LI></UL><H3>TRANSPORT</H3>
	
For transport of chemicals, flasks etc. always use rolling tables (trolley) or trucks. The lifts must be used for transport between the floors. Transporting persons and loads simultaneously in the same lift is not allowed. Never use the lift for transporting persons after normal working hours. Never use the lift during a fire.
<H3>CHEMICAL WASTE</H3>

Always ask a laboratory technician or safety representative before removal of waste. Familiarise yourself with waste requirements at DTU by reading the booklet &quot;Waste and waste water at DTU/DIA&quot;. (Available at libraries).

<H3>RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES</H3>

	Work with radioactive isotopes must only take place after instruction by
(name not shown, room 112, build. 222)
<H3>ACID/BASE</H3>
	
When pouring acid and base up and tubes it is necessary to have safety glasses  
<H3>SAFETY REGULATIONS FOR WORKING WITH MICRO ORGANISMS</H3><UL><LI>You must wear suitable working clothes (laboratory coat) - buttoned up. The working clothes must not be worn in sitting rooms or dining rooms. The working clothes are to be taken off before leaving the building. Covered chairs must not be used in the laboratories.</LI><LI>Transport of micro organisms between the laboratories must only take place in closed containers. Recombinant micro organisms must be marked with a green sticker. Use the lift between the floors.</LI><LI>Waste containing micro organisms must be autoclaved (or other suitable heat treatment) and/or transported to their destination in a suitable closed container. Used plastic petri dishes, plastic bags or other plastic tools as well as plastic syringes (without the needle) and pipette tips must be carefully put into a yellow bag (biological waste). Filled up yellow bags must be closed by a metal clamp and immediately put into special containers standing in a shed outdoors of building 223.</LI><LI>Toxic waste must be detoxified. Fluid waste to be put into special plastic containers and places in the black shelter between building 222 and building 223 for treatment at Kommune Kemi (official destruction department). Solid waste is to be put into yellow bags for destruction.</LI><LI>Syringes, pointed objects etc. are to be used as little as possible. Immediately after use these objects must be put into special closed plastic containers marked &quot;sygehusaffald&quot; (hospital waste).</LI><LI>Glassware etc containing micro organisms must be autoclaved or disinfected in another way before cleaning. Used pipettes are to be put into rodalon (1%) before autoclaving. Used ampoules, pasteur pipettes and microscope slides are to be put into rodalon and thereafter into a plastic container, which must be put into a yellow bag.</LI><LI>Glassware etc with microbial toxins must be detoxified before cleaning. Instructions for this and for extraction work with these toxins can be found at the department. </LI><LI>Mouth pipetting is not allowed.</LI><LI>Smoking and consumption of food and drinks are not allowed in the laboratory.</LI><LI>The work is to be executed in such a way that formation of aerosols is limited as much as possible.</LI><LI>Before starting work, disinfectants (1% rodalon or 70% ethanol) must be available.</LI><LI>Tables and flow benches are to be cleaned with ethanol solution (70%) both before and after use.</LI><LI>The place of work in the laboratory must be cleaned and disinfected daily (70% ethanol). </LI><LI>On direct contact with micro organisms your hands must be washed with disinfecting soap. This is also applicable before a break in the work and at the end of working hours.</LI><LI>Micro organisms must not be poured into the drain.</LI><LI>Should an accident occur (both severe and minor) then call for the laboratory technician or the working supervisor/teaching staff. The accident is reported to one of the security representatives and noted in the logbook at the secretariat.</LI><LI>Work with recombinant (micro) organisms must only take place in laboratories classified for this purpose. Check the sign at the door of the laboratory. Remember to use green class 1 labels for marking solutions and apparatus.</LI><LI>You may only work with GMO´s if your project has been filed with the state work authorities (Arbejdstilsynet). Ask your project leader or one of the persons below</LI><LI>When working with recombinant organisms, only the down-flow safety cabinets must be used.</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
