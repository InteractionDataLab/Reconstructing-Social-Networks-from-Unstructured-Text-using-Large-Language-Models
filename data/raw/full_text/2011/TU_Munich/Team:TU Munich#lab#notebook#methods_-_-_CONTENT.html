Ligations were done with 50 ng vector, T4 Ligase, a total volume of 20 µl and different molar insert:vector ratios. In case the vector is smaller than the insert, more vector is used. If both parts are approximately equal in size, a 1:1 ratio is mostly the best choice. Incubation of ligations were conducted over night (o/n) at 16 °C. Vector and insert controls were added for purity-information of samples. On the next day, ligations were precipitated using ethanol/glycogen and resuspended in 10 µl nuclease free water.
