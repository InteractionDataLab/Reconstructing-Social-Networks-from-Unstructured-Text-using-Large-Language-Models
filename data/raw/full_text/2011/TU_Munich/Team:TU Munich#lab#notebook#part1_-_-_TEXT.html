Autoclave broken
We are not able to prepare any media or sterile materials. Should be working next week again (Andrea is going to tell us).
-> No agar plate/medium preparation possible right now.
But all other necessary stuff seems to be available (for electroporation, competent cells, miniprep-kit, DH5alpha strain, BL21 strain).
19-05-2011
Autoclave working
Other Work
We start preparing Agar-LB Plates with Amp and Kan, as well as normal LB medium.
20-05-2011
Cloning
Transformation
Transformation of all red-light sensor parts separately. DH5 alpha cells were transformed using electroporation (V = 1600V) with following constructs:
Part alias : Part Name - Plasmid - Year of Distribution, Plate Number
iGEM R1 : R0082 pSB1A3 2010, P1
iGEM R2 : I732017 pSB1A2 2010, P2
iGEM R3 : I15010 pSB2K3 2010, P3
iGEM R4 : K098010 pSB4C5 2010, P3
Each electroporation was performed with 1.5 µl BioBrick plasmid (each disolved in 10 µl ddH2O before) and 40 µl competent DH5 alpha cells according to the protocol kindly provided by Andrea Mueckl.
Afterwards cells were incubated in 1 ml SOC medium for 1.5 h at 37 °C, 200 rpm and subsequently plated on LB-agar plates containing antibiotics (50 µl, 100 µl, 200 µl). They were incubated at 37 °C over night and then stored at 4 °C.
23-05-2011
Results
Transformation of all red sensor parts failed. This might have been due to a wrong electroporation protocol.
Cloning
Transformation
Transformation of one red part sensor (iGEM R0082) with slightly modified protocol: electroporation was performed at 1500 V with 1 µl Plasmid (part was previously disolved in 10 µl ddH2O)and 40 µl competent DH5 alpha cells. Otherwise same procedure as before.
Other Work
Making electrocompetent cells according to Andrea's Mueckl protocol.
24-05-2011
Results
Transformation of R0082 resulted in 3 colonies.
Other Work
Inoculation of over-night culture (20 ml) of DH5 alpha cells in Luria-Media for electrocompetent cells.
Inoculation of over-night culture of one clone picked from the successful second transformation.
We asked Dr. J. Winter for heatresistant E. coli. We should get them tomorrow after lunch on a plate and can then culture them.
25-05-2011
Results
The clone picked yesterday turned out as the right one.
Dr. J. Winter wants us to come back tomorrow, since bacteria seem to be contaminated
Cloning
MiniPrep
Testing of the clone: Mini-Prep using Zymoresearch DNA Kit, with subsequent digestion with EcoRI and PstI in NEB-Buffer 4. Afterwards loading ontol Agarose gel (expected fragments 0.1 kbp (= R0082) and 2,0 kbp (= pSB1A2))
Other Work
Continue making cells electrocompetent.
26-05-2011
Results
Again: Dr. J. Winter wants us to come back next day, since bacteria seem to be contaminated.

Transformation
Transformation of
Part alias : Part Name - Plasmid - Year of Distribution, Plate Number
iGEM R2 : I732017 pSB1A2 2010, P2
iGEM R3 : I15010 pSB2K3 2010, P3
iGEM R4 : K098010 pSB4C5 2010, P3
We were using 1510 V and 1 µl DNA for transformation. The DNA was just added to the cells and gently mixed by stirring it with the pipette tip. The protocol used was the one from Andrea Meyer. Of the 1 ml SOC culture, 50 µl were spread out directly on Agar plates. Rest was spun down (2000 rpm, 1 min) and pellet was resuspended in 100 to 150 µl. Subsequently, 50 µl were spread out.
27-05-2011
Results
There are successful clones from transformed cells with iGEM I732017 and iGEM K098010, but no clones from iGEM I15010 at all
Again: Dr. J. Winter wants us to come back next week, as there is still contamination in the culture.
Cloning
Transformation
Transformation of:
Part alias : Part Name - Plasmid - Year of Distribution, Plate Number
iGEM R3 : I15010 pSB2K3 2011, P3
iGEM tRNA : K228001, pSB1A2 2011, P4
iGEM Term : B0015 pSB1AK3 2011, P1
iGEM RBS : J44001 pSB1A2 2011, P1
iGEM T7 : I712074 pSB1AK8 2011, P1
Since the transformation with iGEM I15010 did not work, we increased the amount of plasmid to 2 µl. Afterwards the procedure was performed as mentioned above and the cells were incubated over night (15 h) at 37 °C and cooled until monday at 4 °C.
30-05-2011
Results
We have successful clones from transformed cells with iGEM K228001 (tRNA), iGEM B0015 (Term), iGEM J44001 (RBS), iGEM I712074 (T7).
Finally, we received BM28 cells from Dr. J. Winter (there is an existing paper in JBC from her about the bacteria).
Cloning
Transformation
Transformation of I15010 once more using BL21 and inducing pSB2K3 plasmid using 1 mM IPTG in SOC-Medium.
Other Work
Inoculation of over-night cultures of clones from iGEM K228001 (tRNA), iGEM B0015 (Term), iGEM J44001 (RBS), iGEM I712074 (T7), iGEM I732017 und iGEM K098010
31-05-2011
Results
The transformation of iGEM I15010 (R3) did not work.
We measured plasmid concentrations from MiniPreps (see below) using nano-drop:
- iGEM I712074 (T7): 62 ng/µl
- iGEM K098010 (R4): 82,5 ng/µl
- iGEM K228001 (tRNA): 98 ng/µl
- iGEM I732017 (R2): 94 ng/µl
- iGEM B0015 (Term): 141 ng/µl
- iGEM J44001 (RBS): 108 ng/µl
- iGEM R0082 (R1): 59 ng/µl
Cloning
MiniPrep
Plasmid Isolation (MiniPrep) from all over night cultures was conducted and the concentrations were measured.
01-06-2011
Results
A SDS-PAGE was conducted from the cultures induced with IPTG on 50-05-2011. The cells were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in loading buffer. The gel ran inconclusive, next time  there should be alonger run with higher voltage. Only 1/3 of the lane was used by the peptides. It had a very bad resolution. However, the dying step worked properly.
Cloning
Digestion
- A restriction digestion of the parts gained by MiniPrep was conducted using EcoRI and PstI in NEB-Buffer 4. Afterwards, they were applied onto an agarose gel.
- Properties of the gel run with the digested samples: 100 V, 1 h 10 Min, 1 % agarose.
- SYBR Gold staining: 2 µl on shaking plate for 30 mins at room temperature (RT).
Transformation
Transformation of DH5 alpha with:
iGEM I15010 (R3) (see above) on ampicilin (A, Amp), chloramphenicol (C, Cm) and kanamycin (K, Kan) containing resistance plates;
iGEM High Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 1G, psB1A3 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: A;
iGEM Low Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 3C, psB3C5 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: C.
They were plated on agar plates carrying the appropriate antibiotic resistances and incubated at 37 °C over night.
03-06-2011
Results
Another SDS-PAGE gel run again inconclusive. Furthermore during the run, there was a loss of electrical power because of some blackout in the building.
Transformed cells grew very well over night, with a few clones of iGEM I15010 (R3) on kanamycin resistance plate found. This is evidence for a contamination, because the incubator did not cool down to 4 °C over thursday.
The transformed plasmid-cells grew also very good - now featured in red.
Cloning
Digestion
An agarose gel was run with digestions from yesterday, using the following settings: 90 V, 1 h 30 Min, 1 % agarose.
SYBR Gold staining: 2 µl on shaking plate for 30 mins at RT.
06-06-2011
Results
The agarose gel was again inconclusive. There may be too less material, since no bands around 100 bp could be detected at all.
Cloning
Digestion
Another digestion was conducted and analyzed on an agaorse gel. It ran with newly digested and undigested plasmid as control: 100 V, 1 h 30 Min, 1 % agarose.
Transformation
Transformation of I15010 (R3) in E. coli D1210
Other Work
Over-night culture of the following parts were inoculated:
iGEM High Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 1G, psB1A3 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: A;
iGEM Low Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 3C, psB3C5 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: C.
07-06-2011
Results
The transformation of I15010 (R3) finally worked using E. coli D1210 cells.
MiniPrep of the over night culture of iGEM Low Copy Plasmid, Plate 1 2011 3C, psB3C5 with insert: BBa_J04450, Resistance: C resulted in 101 ng/µl in a total volume of 100 µl.
We have run out of DNA-Plasmid Preparation Kit. No more preparations are possible during the next days, until we have a new kit!
A new digestion was conducted. The subsequent gel still was inconclusive.
Cloning
Digestion
The digestion was repeated. In order to have a more sensitive detection of DNA on the gel, we now use ethidium bromide for staining of the gel. The following settings are used: 2 % Agarose with ethidium bromide, 90 V, 1.5 h.
Digestion of 2 µg Plasmid DNA with high fidelity 1.: EcoRI and PstI enzymes and 2.: just with PstI was conducted.
08-06-2011
Results
gel: R1, R2, R4 tRNA und Term seem ok; T7 promotor (46bp) and RBS (15bp) could not be detected ---> PAGE necessary!
