According to the DNA Sequence (see meetings 22.08. and 15.8) the part contains lacZ, but the sequence data is bad in the region of the T7 promotor. To find out whether the T7 promotor is present, we performed an in vitro assay. At first, the DNA samples of interest were transcribed using a T7 polymerase (for exact composition of reaction mixture see below), incubation time: 2h at 37 °C. After this, each sample was split in two halves. One of these each of these halves was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes in presence of RNase. Finally, the different samples were separated in a 2% Agarose gel. The RNase should destroy the RNA produced by the T7 polymerase. Thus if two corresponding lines of the gel are compared, bands that only appear in one of the two lines are caused by RNA. This means that the respective DNA construct contained a T7 promoter. For exact protocol also see Methods. </P><P>The following DNA samples were transcribed in vitro using a T7 polymerase:

<I>Sample Number - Part Name - Date - concentration (ng/ul)</I></P><P>- 1 - 2b - 13.07.2011 - 215 </P><P>- 2 - Trafo 2b Nr. 1 - 17.08.2011 - 106</P><P>- 3 - Trafo 2b Nr. 2 - 17.08.2011 - 121</P><P>- 4 - mistake - was thrown away</P><P>- 5 - Trafo 2b Nr. 4 - 17.08.2011 - 130</P><P>- 6 - Trafo 2b Nr. 5 - 17.08.2011 - 118</P><P>- Positive Control (PK) - Miniprep iGEM T7 - 31.05.11 - 58</P><P>
The size of the construct in samples 1 - 6 is approx. 6.6 kb, the size of the construct of the positive Control is approx. 3.4 kb. Thus, the number of plasmids per microliter is approximately the same in all samples (only half the amount of sample 1 was used).
The reaction mixture contained:  2 µl buffer (40 mM TrisHCl, 40 mM MgCl2), 2 µl DTT (10 mM), 2 µl T7 Polymerase (50 u /µl), 10 µl DNA (only 5 µl in Sample 1), 1µl rNTPs (4 mM), fill up to 20 µl with ddH2O.
After incubation (2h at 37 °C), 10  µl of each sample was taken and mixed with 1 µl of RNase and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. After this, all 12 samples were separated using a 2 % Agarose Gel (2log DNA ladder). Gel electrophoresis, 100 V, 400 mA, ca. 1:30 h.</P></DIV></DIV><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" class="results">Results</SPAN></H3><DIV class="results"><P><I>Transformations:</I> The transformation of K238013 into DH5alpha cells on LB with Cm from yesterday was successful. However, all the colonies were pink (part not inserted!?). The T7promotor grew on Amp and Kan.
From the last days: The transformation of B0015 and K238013 yielded pink bands (part not inserted!?).</P><P><I>In Vitro Assay</I></P><P>Samples #2 through #6a look very much alike, with the only difference being the &quot;blurry blobs&quot; at the bottom of the gel (not visible in #2a). We assume that these &quot;blobs&quot; are caused by RNA fragments, which leads us to the conclusion that RNase was present in all of these samples. The reason for this might be the fact that these samples were prepared from cells without performing an ethanol precipitation and thus, RNase from the cells might contaminate the samples. Looking at the samples #5 and #5a as well as #6 and #6a, for example, there is a band at about 6 kb. This must be DNA. This and the fact that there is digested RNA visible at the bottom leads us to the conclusion, that the band at 6 kb is a plasmid containing a T7 promoter (--&gt; accordingly, this should be the correct plasmid containing T7 promoter and lacZ). To verify this, a second in vitro assay should be performed after inhibition of RNase in these samples.
Comparison of #1 and #1a shows that part 2b must contain a T7 promoter, because of the blurred signal in #1 which is missing in #1b. This must be RNA which was digested by the RNase present in #1b. In both #1 and #1a there are bands at approximately 6 kb and 3 kb (6 kb could be the backbone containing T7 promoter and lacZ, 3 kb could be backbone containing only the t7 promoter). This DNA might be two different plasmids. This explains why the sequencing results are bad. At least one of these plasmids contains a T7 promoter, but it is unclear which one.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
