Further testing is needed, especially with regard to the following questions:</P><UL><LI> What is the temperature optimum of the blue light sensor and how does this influence the AND-Gate? For this, characterization of the bluelight sensor should be considered (see other iGEM teams).
</LI><LI> Does the red light sensor work correctly (which could not be proven by previous experiments)?  As no other teams managed to get this part to work properly, we need to characterize it further. The best way to do this would be testing of the following construct: BBa_K568000 + RBS + GFP
</LI><LI> Has the red ligth sensor an asymptotic on steady state such that further radiation with red off light is needed ?
</LI><LI> What are the optimum and maximum durations of measurement? For this, the modeling results should be considered.

This is a vector which has a low copy number (around 15-20). This is needed to make the promoter work properly in E.Coli. The low copy number ensures a good ratio between the promoter and its repressor, which is naturally present in E.Coli. When a high copy number is used, the promoter is abundant which results in a constituitivly active promoter.&quot; source <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K238015:Design" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K238015:Design</A></P><P>--&gt; subcloning of K568003 into low copy vector pSB4A5 (was in pSB1A2)</P></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="15-10-11">15-10-11</SPAN></H2><P><B>People: Marta</B></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="cloning">Cloning</SPAN></H3><DIV class="cloning"><P>Preparation of restricted DNA and Ligation</P><P>Gel of the digested DNA:
</P><P>The T7 Promoter was cut with S,P and not with E,P as described in the picture.</P><P>The different bands were cut out and stored in the -20 freezer in the Box 3.

We plated on three different dates (12.10.2011, 13.10.211 and 14.10.2011) depending on the results.</P><P><I>Constitutive promoter (J23100) with LacZ (I732017)</I></P><P>The plasmid contains an RFP-casette that is cut out when the ligation is performed correctly. We could observe, that it takes some time for the cells to produce the RFP. After they have reached a certain size, they turn violet. As the table shows we have both violet and white colonies.  In order to obtain the right cells we will have to pick the withe colonies.  This ligation probably worked, since the cells of the vector background, that serve as a control are mostly violet. The ones that are white are not big enough to produce the RPF, but are likely to do so after further incubation.</P><P><I>T7-promoter (I712074) with rbs-GFP (K081012)</I></P><P>The measurements from the 12.10 and the 13.10 were performed with a very low concentration, which is probably the reason why we otained almost no cells. The results from the 14.10 prove that the ligation must have worked, for we obtained cells in all samples but the vector background.</P><P><I>Constitutive promoter (J23100) with rbs-GFP (K081012)</I></P><P>Under the UV-Lamp it is easy to distinguish the cells containing RFP from the ones containing GFP. The fact, that there are green fluorescent cells means the ligation has worked.</P><P><I>Red light sensor (K568000) and rbs-GFP (K081012)</I></P><P>This ligation also seems to have worked. even thought there are some cells on the plate with the vector background, the ration is still ok. Also we could observe fluorescence in the sample number 15. The others didn't show luminiscence yet for they had not been incubating as long as sample 15</P><P><I>AND-Gate (K568001) in psBB4A5</I></P><P>Since there are as many colonies on the ligation-plate than on the vector background we believe this ligation did not work. We have to find out why the cells did not turn violet, as they should have, for the psBB4A5 contains an RFP-casette, that is cut out when the ligation is correctly performed.</P><P><I>Blue light sensor (K238013) with rbs-GFP (K081012)</I></P><P>The data indicates, that the ligation may not have worked. Since we decided to characterize the blue light sensor with lacZ we will probably not repeat this ligation even though it didn't work.</P><P><I>Ligations: Excitation Test</I></P><P>Colonies on ligations 10 (const. promotor with GFP) and 15 (red light sensor with GFP) produced (green to yellow) fluorescence when excited with light of 380 nm. This might imply that the ligations worked and the parts are successfully producing GFP. In the case of red light sensor with GFP, the ambient light seemed to be sufficient to trigger a leaky production of GFP.</P></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="17-10-11">17-10-11</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="cloning">Cloning</SPAN></H3><DIV class="cloning"><P><I>Ligations from 11-10-11</I></P><P>In order to find out, whether the ligations of const. prom. + lacZ in DH5 alpha were successful (Ligations 1-4), 2 colonies of each ligation plate were inoculated into LB (Amp).
