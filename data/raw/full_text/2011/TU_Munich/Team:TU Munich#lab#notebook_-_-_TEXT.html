Labbook
See Methods for a detailed description of the protocols we used. Solid Matrix enlists our experiments to find the optimal gel for our and gate. Lightbox describes the setup of the lightbox that was used to irradiate the bacteria at different wavelengths. Cloning I and Cloning II show our unsuccessful attempts to clone our construct. Finally Cloning III + Results displays our successful cloning attempts and our procedural method to characterize the parts. All work done after the European Jamboree is explained in Cloning IV + Results.
