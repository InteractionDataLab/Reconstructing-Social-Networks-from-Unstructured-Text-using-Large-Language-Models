Cloning
Ligation
Three ligations in total were conducted. K238013 (S,P) was quick-ligated with lacZ (X,P), rbs (S,P) with T7Pol (X,P) and T7Prom (S,P) with lacZ (X,P).
Transformation
The ligations were transformed into DH5alpha. Additionally, K238013 (from23-08-2011) was transformed into DH5alpha. The ligation of K238013 with lacZ is plated onto Amp and Cm, rbs with T7pol is plated onto Amp, T7Prom with lacZ onto Kan and K238013 is plated onto Amp and Cm.
Testing
The two cultures of K322127 in DH5alpha incubated over night with red light (ca. 630 nm) were split. One half was further incubated with red light, while the other half was incubated with sun light and  light from a table-lamp over night.
Test of negative controls on S-Gal: T7prom (Kan) transformed into DH5alpha and K322127 (Cm) transformed into BL21 were inoculated onto S-Gal plates with the respective antibiotics. The are incubated over night, and should not yield black colonies, as they both should not be able to express functional lacZ.
Results
Expression test of reporter plasmid: The cultures with ligation of T7prom and lacZ transformed into BL21 and induced with IPTG showed black colonies on the S-Gal plates. However, the cultures, which were NOT induced also showed black colonies of the same intensity. At the current point, we cannot sufficiently explain this.
Red light sensor assembly (Bea and Thorsten)
aim:
Ligation of red light sensor didn't work, yet. Therefore we ligated PCR product of BBa_K322127(X and P cut) into pSB3C5(S and P cut) to verify correct sites. Subsequent amplification and recutting of this part should lead to correct ligation with SupD.
In parallel, PCR was performed again in case of failed ligations with existent PCR-products.
Materials:

Cloning
Digestion
R2 (red writing: MiniPrep iGEM R2 31.5.11) was digested with X,P and T7prom (black writing: 17.6.11 T7) with S,P. After heat-inactivation, GLP was added to the digested DNA. The samples were applied onto a 1 % Agarose gel. The samples, along with those from the PCR (see below), were applied as follows: 2lod DNA ladder (5 ul); R2 (20 ul); R2 (20 ul); T7prom (20 ul); T7 prom (20 ul); PCR cut; positive control; PCR approach 1; PCR approach 1; PCR approach 2; PCR approach 2; PCR approaches 1 and 2 pooled. The gel was run for 1:30 h at 110 V. The following bands were expected:  3.1 kbp for lacZ with rbs and 2 kbp for vector pSB1A2. 3.4 kbp for T7prom in pSB1AK8. The bands are excised from the gel and the DNA is recovered using freeze 'n squeeze.
The original file before cutting of the bands seems to be corrupt.
Ligation
In the next step, K238013 (from 23-08-2011; cut with S,P) was ligated with rbs&lacZ (=R2; X,P), rbs (from 22-08-2011; S,P) with T7pol (from 23-08-2011; X,P) and T7prom (S,P) with rbs&lacZ (X,P). Each time, ligation was performed as normal and as quick-ligation. After that, the transformed cells were plated onto LB (Amp) plates and incubated over night.

Result
Testing
SDS-PAGE
1 OD_600 each from the K322127 in DH5alpha cultures from yesterday was taken. The OD_600 were: 0.835 for the first colony exposed to bright lamp (bright 1); 0.84 for the second colony exposed to bright lamp (bright 2); 1.685 for the first colony incubated with red light (red 1); 1.855 for the second colony incubated with red light (red 2). The cells were centrifuged at 13000 rcf for 8 min. After resuspension in 100 ul loading buffer, the tubes were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C. After that, the samples (5 ul and 10 ul) were loaded onto a 10 % SDS-PAGE with stacking gel. Pageruler was used as protein ladder. The gel was run for 2:00 h at 80 V, which was increased to 120 V when the buffer front reaching the separation gel. After that, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue and subsequently destained.
The gel does not show elevated intensities of the band at around 10 kDa for lacZ alpha peptide, which would have been expected.
T7 promoter in vitro assay
As proposed yesterday, a second in vitro assay was performed to find out if the plasmids contain a T7 promoter. This time, a third sample was made for each plasmid (same plasmids as yesterday, see above). In this sample (labeled "#xi") the RNase that we assume to be present were inhibited using RNA secure prior to addition of T7 polymerase and incubation. See methods for detailed procedure. The 2% agarose gel was run at 110 V, 400 mA for 1:30 hours.
Other Work
K322127 Inoculation & Incubation:
The following inoculations were performed:
- "K238013 in DH5 alpha", plate date: 24.08.2011, yesterday's transformation, in LB Amp
- "BM28 from Jeanette Winter", plate date: 31.05.2011, in LB Amp, Kan
- "green light 2", plate date: 27.6.2011, in LB Cm
- "green light 3", plate date: 27.6.2011, in LB Cm
- "green light 4", plate date: 27.6.2011, in LB Cm
- "K322127 in DH5 alpha, Kolonie 1, Licht-induziert", plate date: 22.08.11, in LB cm (the picked colonies were the black ones after over night incubation in light)
- "K322127 in DH5 alpha, Kolonie 2, Rotlicht-deaktiviert", plate date: 22.08.11, in LB cm (the picked colonies were white ones after over night incubation in red light)
Incubation over night at 37 °C, 200 rpm.
Results
The PCR was successful (see picture Restriction & Ligation), the positive control and both samples yielded DNA that is located at the right spot according to their length positive control (10kB) samples (3,8kB)
Results
24.08.11
T7 promoter in vitro assay
The samples labeled "#xi" were treated with RNA secure to inhibit potentially present RNase. The gel photo shows blurry signals in all of these lanes which aren't visible in lanes "#x" and "#xa". This proves that RNase is present in the DNA samples used in the assay. Also, the fact that the RNA signals are quite large and strong shows leads us to the conclusion that the examined plasmids all contain a T7 promoter. Sample 1 contains two plasmids (about 6.6 kb and 3.5 kb) which is the reason for the bad sequencing data. Samples 2, 3, 5 and 6 contain one 6.6 kb plasmid each. This should be our correct reporter plasmid, part 2b, containing T7 promoter and lacZ. To verify this, a sample shall be sequenced.
S-Gal negative Control:
DH5alpha cells transformed with T7prom yielded white colonies on the S-Gal plates. However, BL21 cells transformed with K322127 yielded all black colonies. Most likely, our strain of BL21 is unsuited for expression tests using S-Gal (might constitutively express lacZ).
Expression test of K322127
After over night incubation, both plates incubated in red light showed white colonies only. Of the two plates incubated under the lamp, one did not show any colonies. The other one showed black colonies.  --> First evidence that part K322127 works as expected!!! To further quantify and characterise this: Miller assay? Other methods?

Cloning
Miniprep & Glycero-Stock: The cultures inoculated yesterday on LB were frozen at -80 °C as glycero-stocks. The culture of K238013 (pSB1A2) in DH5alpha was prepped. The resulting DNA yielded a concentration of approximately 300 ng/ul.
Repetition of transformations:
The transformations from yesterday (ligation using ligation protocol) were repeated using DH5alpha cells (kindly provided by Andrea). Transformations were done for reporter plasmid (part 2b) colony 5 from DATUM, K238013 with lacZ, rbs with T7pol and T7prom with lacZ. After incubation for one hour, the cells were plated on LB Amp (K238013 with lacZ; rbs with T7pol) and on LB Kan (reporter plasmid; T7prom with lacZ) and incubated over night.
Ligation of new PCR product with pSB1A2
Material:
cut PCR (X,P) product from K322127 from PCR 25.8.2011  cut pSB1A2 (X,P)  from Alex from 25.8.
procedure:
we purified PCR product using Zymo DNA Clean +Concentrator 25
ligation:
sample 1:  15µl PCR product  5µl vector sample 2:  10µl PCR product 10µl vector
Transformation of the ligation and R2 as transformation control:
the two samples from purifiying and the part R2( OmpR in pSB1A2) as a positive control were transformed via electroperforation in competent DH5alpha cells that were kindly supplied by Andrea Mückl.
Testing
Testing K322127
Material: inoculated cultures of DH5alpha with K322127 from 25.8 Procedure:  100 µl of the culture was spread on S-gal plates with Kan and amp in dark Incubation of the plates at room temperature (30°C) under light of diode with maximum of 630nm (turn-off diode) for 2 hours afterwards incubation at light at 37°C for 19 hours afterwards 4°C in the incubator: one culture with aluminium TUM logo put on top  one culture in the box under light of turn-off diode (negative control) one culture on top of the box, light from turn-off diode from below, light from the incubator from top only on cut out TUM logo in aluminium foil
Results
26-08-2011
Transformations: The transformations from yesterday, including K238013 & lacZ, rbs & T7pol, T7prom & lacZ as well as PCR product & Vector, did not work at all. There were no colonies on the plates.
Sequencing: More data from the sequencing from 19-08-2011 arrived. The newly ligated K238013 & double terminator from 17-08-2011 does contain the double terminator. However, as witnessed before, the blue light promotor K238013, which was part of the plasmid prior to ligation, is missing. We are still awaiting the data from another sequencing from the same construct, but from another ligation.
Planning for next week: We need to prepare new electrocompetent DH5alpha cells. EVERYONE, who has free time to spare, please come to the lab and help. We might also be able to get new BL21 (DE3) cells from Prof. Buchner. If anyone wants to get them, contact Lars Mitschke at the Lehrstuhl of Prof. Buchner and talk to him about the request, which Alex asked about. BL21 (DE3) contain a T7polymerase, which can be induced by IPTG. This would be great use in order to test our reporter plasmid, i case the ligation worked (which we should know on Monday).

Cloning
inoculation the following were inoculated: T7 Promotor with lacZ 2x K322127 in DH5alpha
Retransformation of reporter plasmid clone 5
the reporter plasmid clone 5  (118ng/µl) was diluted to 50 pg/µl and to 20 ng/µl
1 µl of each dilution was transformed into DH5alpha
Transformation of RBS
0,42 µl of RBS (47,5 ng/µl) were transformed into DH5alpha
Results
26-08-2011
transformations
were only successful for R2, T7 Promotor with lacZ, reporter plasmid colony 5
testing of K322127
only very small colonies on the plate with no coloring plate that was illuminated with turn-off light and light from the incubator dried out. no black colonies could be detected. Incubation of plate with TUM pattern was continued. Plate was irradated with a light bulb.
sequencing of reporter plasmid colony 5
Bases in squared brackets are optional and belonging to another sequence. Due tu overlapping base shifts exact assignment of bases is difficult
Sequencing reveals mixed clones. Correct Sequence with T7 promotor - RBS – lacZ is probably present beneath construct with T7 promotor lacking. Preparation of RBS-LacZ vector was contaminated with uncut or religated vector. Since plasmid length was ok, construct should be present.
next steps:
Retransformation with 50 pg and 20 ng MiniPrep DNA will be performed with subsequent sequencing of 4 clones. In parallel new construct from Alex will be sequenced.
30-08-2011
People: Thorsten, Bea
Results
29.8.11
Re-Transformation of part 2b clone 5 with 20 ng vector was succesful. 50 pg vector didnt yield any colonies. RBS was tranformed succesfully. 5 ml LB o/n cultures with apropriate antibiotica were inoculated and incubated at 37° C shaking. Mini Prep and sequencing will be performed at 31.8.11
Cloning
Electrocompetent cells
new electrocompetent cells (DH5alpha) were made by the following protocol:
a 20 ml Luria medium overnight culture was inoculated with electrocompetent DH5alpha (kindly provided Andrea Mückl) yesterday
350 ml Luria medium were inoculated with 15 ml of the overnight culture and incubated at 37°C until a OD(600) of 0,7 was reached
the medium was distributed on falcons and the cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min at 4°C
after discarding the supernatant 350 ml of sterile ice-cold 10% glycerol was added and the pellets were resuspended using a pipet
the resuspension was centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 4°C for 11 minutes
after discarding the supernatant the cells were resuspended again in 350 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol ( cells kept chilled all the time)
and again centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 4°C for 11 minutes
the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in the remaining supernatant
the cells were dispensed in 40 µl aliquots and stored at -80°C for further use
Planning
In order to get ligations working, purification steps will be performed using Promegas Wizard PCR and Gel clean up Kit.  We are going to ligate PCR product into pSB1C3 and upstream of SupD-tRNA. In parallel, T7ptag will be ligated into AND-Gate Plasmid, which will be pSB1C3. [First step of assembly]
Then, synthesis product, which contains parts from SupDtRNA to RBS J44001, will be ligated into succesful AND-Gate Plasmid-T7ptag. The last step will be ligation of PCR-product into this construct.
Excel sheets can be found in DropBox folder "protocols".
planned parts
PCR product ligated into pSB1C3 will be a new part "red light sensor without lacZ".
PCR product ligated with SupD will be a new part as well.
Synthesis product is another maybe not so useful part which will be send into the registry.
Reporter plasmid will be another Part. This one was called "part 2B" in recent cloning steps and needs further validation (see 29.8. retransformation and sequencing)
Restriction digest
All digestions were complete and running on the expected lengths.

2: 24,5ng/µl
3: 24,5 ng/µl
5: 20,5 ng/µl
9: 20,0 ng/µl

RBS reporter plasmid clone 1-5 K322127 from plate from 24.8.2011
31-08-2011
Results
30.8.11
Electrocompetent cells show good transformation efficiency. 100µl 10µl and 1µl of test transformation of 30 ng BBa_K322127 were plated on LB/cam plates. 1 µl yielded ca 400 colonies which refers to a tranformationefficiency of 1.3*10^7 cfu/µg BBa_K322127 in pSB1C3. 1*10^8 cfu/µg pUC19 is expected, so 1.3*10^7 cfu/µg vector with insert seems to be ok.
cph8 from Uppsala was succesfully transformed into DH5alpha. Cells have been 1:3 diluted and 20 ng plasmid was used. Output was ca 10^6 - 10^7 cfu/µg. Plate will be stored at 4°C til inoculation of o/n culture with subsequent minipreparation.

Cloning
gel purification of 30.8.11 digest
20 µl of remaining digestions (made on 30.8.11) were loaded on 1 % agarose gel with 1xTAE. Items 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12 were used. This samples were cut using 350nm UV illumination as short as possible. Cut gel slices were subsequently purified  using Promegas Wizard Kit according to manufacturers instructions.
Determination of concentration with Nanodrop resultet in not reliable data. Therefore quantitative 0.7 % agarose gel was run with 5 µl of each sample. 5 µl 2 log ladder was used (100 µg/ml). PCR Band (3.8 kbp) in line 2 was estimated to 75 ng. This gives aproximately 15 ng/µl. Intensities of 2 kbp band in line 4 as well as lines 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 correspond to approx. 150 ng amount (--> 30 ng/µl).
Due to fly-by-night intensity of ladder those concentrations will be determined again on 02.09.11 for further ligations. Ligations today will be done with the following concentrations
o/n ligation with T4 Ligase
P, S opened Vector containing blue light promotor was ligated with RBS-LacZ insert. Due to huge insert lengths, insert:vector ratios were choosen as can be seen in ligation table.
Ligation was conducted at 16° C in thermocycler o/n using 20 µl sample volume and 1 µl T4 DNA ligase. Examplary calculation of I/V ratio for 6x molar excess of insert (source: http://openwetware.org/wiki/DNA_Ligation ):

Cloning
Digest of T7 promoter
Full volume of digest was loaded onto gel (50 µl digest + 10 µl 6 x Gel loading buffer)
Band with correct size of 3,5 kbp was cut using 365 nm illumination. Illumination time was kept as short as possible, picture was taken after cutting gel slice.

Transformation of purified ligations (02-09-2011)
positive control showed several thousand red colonies. All ligations showed bacterial lawn, including vector control.
Vector prep contains uncut or single cut vector. This result is consistent with sequencing results, which indicate mixed clones. Next steps: Preperation of 46 bp T7 promoter insert with 3 % preparative agarose gel and ligation upstream of RBS_lacZ into opened RBS_lacZ vector. In parallel vector prep of T7 promoter will be repeated on 1% agarose gel with a long gel and run. Uncut and single cut vector will be loaded on gel aswell.
Transformation of 03-09-2011 ligations
showed following output:
pSB1A3 colonies were possibly red. --> incubated again o/n
http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J04450 --> red color indicates religated or uncut vector clone
4 clones of each successful transformation were picked and inoculated into 5 ml LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotica.

ONPG-Test - Miller Assay
The assay was conducted following the protocol:
3 samples of K322127 in DH5alpha were assayed: 1 sample was incubated for 25 hours in the dark at room temperature 1 sample was incubated for 25 hours in the light at room temperature 1 sample was incubated for 25 hours in the turn-off light at room temperature
- inoculation of 4 x 2ml LB with 10 μl of overnight cultures of K322127 (see 02-09-2011)
- light induction when the cultures reach OD of around
- control with only LB
start of Assay:
- measurement of Abs(600nm)
- new eppi with 1 ml of Zbuffer + 20 μl of freshly prepared 0,1% SDS+ 40 μl of Chloroform (under fume hood)
- 100 μl of the samples are taken and transferred to the Zbuffer
- mix the solution by vortexing for 10 s
- let the chloroform settle to the ground and take  700 μl of supernatant for measurement
- initiation of assay with 140μl of ONPG (4mg/ml) NOTE START TIME
(in the paper they use 100 μl supernatant plus 20 μl of ( 4mg/ml but we need more for measurement in cuvette)
-incubation at room temperature until yellow color develops
-stop reaction with 350 μl of 1 M Na2CO3 NOTE STOP TIME  (we upscaled the paper uses 50 μl)
- measurement of Abs (420nm) and Abs(550nm)
Abs 420 nm should be less than 1 and more than 0,5
Result
incubation for 146 min because no visible yellow color developed;
not completely clear how to calculate the miller units:
here miller units are calculated as following:
units= 1000* (Abs 420-1,75 Abs550) /(time(min)*Abs 600/(11,6*1,7)))

1. add 2 µl 3 M sodium acetate, 0.5 µl glycogen and 22.5 µl isopropanol to 20 µl ligation product
2. incubate the mixture at -20°C for one hour
3. centrifuge the mixture for 15 minutes at 18,000 rpm, 4°C
4. discard the supernatant
5. add 50 µl 70 % ethanol
6. centrifuge the mixture for another 10 minutes at 18,000 rpm, 4°C
7. remove supernatant with a pipet CAREFULLY. If pellet moves, centrifuge again.
8. air-dry the pellet until the ethanol is completely evaporated. Do not over-dry pellet as this makes dissolving more difficult.
9. resuspend the pellet in 10 µl nuclease-free water by pipetting carefully.
10 µl purified ligation was mixed with 40 µl competent cells and electroporated into DH5alpha.
1 ml SOC medium (SOB medium + 20 mM glucose) was used and incubation was carried out for 1h at 37°C, shaking at 500 rpm in 2 ml eppis.

Std Primer VR seems to misprime to B0015 double terminator: http://partsregistry.org/Help:Primers/Problems_using_VF2_and_VR_to_amplify_BioBrick_parts
Could be a problem when sequencing into our construct from downstream primer binding site as we use B0015 in synthetic construct. Because sequencing was done succesfully using this primer by others, we'll try it keeping the mispriming in mind. --> B0014 would be a better terminator for next time.
pSB1C3 is using B0056 as terminator downstream of suffix.

Sequence of Blue light promotor with downstream RBS+lacZ is correct.
Sequence of first 1000 bp of PCR-Product shows one possible silent mutation in PcyA (Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) gen on Position 45 T->C. Resulting triplet is CCC instead of CCT, which both code for proline.
Rest of PCR product should be sequenced aswell? Two more primers would be necessary to cover whole sequence.
Or: functionality check using CP919 strain should result in comparable Miller Unit output between PCR product only and red light original part K322127 as CP919 is Φ(OmpC-lacZ)10-25

Vector prep pSB1A3 and pSB1C3
The restricted vectors ID10 pSB1A3 and ID12 pSB1C3 from 30-08-2011 were applied onto a 1 % agarose gel and prepped using the Wizard SV gel purification kit.
The vector pSB1A3 was single cut, while pSB1C3 was cut with E and P (from K322127). The expected lengths are about 2 kbp for pSB1C3 and about 3 kbp for pSB1A3, as it also contains a RFP cassette.
The measured concentrations were 12.5 ng/µl for pSB1A3 and 11.5 ng/µl for pSB1C3, in a resuspended volume of 50 µl.

Electrocompetent cells
new electrocompetent cells (DH5alpha) were made by the following protocol:
20 ml LB medium was inoculated with 1 µl electrocompetent DH5alpha (kindly provided by Andrea Mückl)
350 ml LB medium were inoculated with 15 ml of the overnight culture and incubated at 37°C until a OD(600) of 0,7 was reached
the medium was distributed on falcons and the cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min at 4°C
after discarding the supernatant 350 ml of sterile ice-cold 10% glycerol was added and the pellets were resuspended using a pipet
the resuspension was centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 4°C for 11 minutes
after discarding the supernatant the cells were resuspended again in 350 ml of ice-cold 10% glycerol (cells kept chilled all the time)
and again centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 4°C for 11 minutes
the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in the remaining supernatant

Cloning
The over night culture of part I746907 (pSB1A2) in DH5alpha was centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. Because of time reasons, the miniprep will be done tomorrow, the pellet was stored at -20°C.
Furthermore, parts BBa_K568002 (blue light sensor, RBS, LacZ) and BBa_K568003 (T7 promoter, RBS, LacZ) need to be transfered into shipping vector pSB1C3. Therefore, the parts are digested, the vector has already been cut with E and P.
Digests
Blue light sensor, RBS, LacZ in pSB1A2 (tube labelled: Miniprep 04-09-2011, clone 2, c=50 ng/µl) and T7 promoter, RBS, lacZ in pSB1AK8 (miniprep from 09-09-2011, clone 2c, c=131 ng/µl) were cut with E and P.
Next, the digested DNA was loaded onto a preparative 1% gel. After the electrophoresis was complete, the correct bands were cut out on the UV transilluminator (365 nm) before the following gel photo was recorded:
The gel looks fine. Cutting out the correct band had to be done very carefully in lanes 1 and 2, because the bands for the vector and the insert were very close together (vector: 3.4 kb, insert: 3.1 kb). Lanes 3 and 4 also show the expected bands, at about 3.2 kb for the insert and about 2 kb for the vector.
Finally, the DNA was extracted and purified from the cut-out gel slices using the Promega Wizard Kit according to the kit protocol.
The following concentrations were measured (Nanodrop):
blue light sensor, RBS, lacZ: 10 ng/µl
T7 promoter, RBS, lacZ: 10 ng/µl
Ligations
As a next step, the following ligation was performed (see table below). We used the opportunity to compare the old (NEB) and the new (Metabion) ligase. The ligation was incubated at 16 °C over night.

Cloning
Miniprep
Part I746907 (pSB1A2) was purified from yesterday's DH5alpha-pellet using the miniprep-kit according to protocol. The concentration was determined to be 63 ng/µl using Nanodrop.
Glycogen/Ethanol precipitation and Transformation
Yesterday's ligations were purified using glycogen/ethanol precipitation. The yielded 10 µl DNA-Solution were used completely for Transformation in DH5alpha. After electroporation, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1h in SOC-media. After this, they were plated onto LB-Agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics.
Digestions
The cloning of our last unfinished part (BBa_K568004), "optogenetical AND-Gate without first promoter - choose your first input" was started today. The part consists of our synthetic construct plus t7ptag. Our synthetic construct (in pMA-RQ) was digested for preparation using E and S, while the miniprepped part I746907 was digested using E and S to check if the prepped plasmids are correct (a mistake was made during preparation of the digest, so a second digest was made at the same time. Both digests were loaded onto the analytical gel):
The product of the preparative digest was loaded onto a preparative 1% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the desired band was cut out on the UV-transilluminator (365 nm) before the gel photo was recorded:
The product of the preparative digest was loaded onto a preparative 1 % agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the desired band was cut out on the UV-transilluminator (365 nm) before the gel photo was recorded: :
The gel looks as expected. The cut out bands around 400 bp are the synthetic construct while the vector can be seen at 2.4 kb.
The product of the control digest was loaded onto an analytic 0.8 % agarose gel. The following gel photo was recorded:
Lane 1 (correct digest): Part BBa_I746907 is 924 bp long, the gel shows the corresponding bands. The vector pSB1A2 is 2079 bp long and can also be seen at the expected spot.
Lane 2 (wrong digest): The bands show that the digest doesn't work properly in 10x NEB4 buffer. The band around 3 kb is uncut or singly cut vector with insert.
Testing
Miller Assay with reporter construct
We incubated two cultures over night in LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics:
BBa_K568003 (T7 promotor and β-galactosidase) in BL21(DE3);
Negative control BBa_I732017 (rbs and β-galactosidase) in DH5 alpha.
The cultures were diluted to a OD_600 of about 0.7 and incubated for another 30 min. Then, the cultures were induced with IPTG at different concentrations:
BBa_K568003: 0 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1.0 mM and 1.5 mM;
BBa_I732017: 0 mM and 1.0 mM.
Before induction and every 30 min, the Miller Units were measured as follows:
measurement of Abs(600nm) in plate reader (volume of bacterial suspension should be equal in all wells, ideally 170 µl)
new eppi with 0,5 ml of Zbuffer + 20 μl of freshly prepared 0,1% SDS + 40 μl of Chloroform (under fume hood) + 500 µl sample solution (e.g. 430 µl medium + 20 µl bacterial suspension)
mix the solution by vortexing for 10 s (all samples with equal vortexing time)
let chloroform settle down (this takes about 5 min, if tube still contains blurred solution, centrifuge for 1 min, RT, 4000 rcf)
transfer 100 μl of supernatant to 96 well plate (for photometer)
initiation of assay with 20 μl of ONPG (4mg/ml), mix well, NOTE START TIME
incubation at 37 °C
stop reaction with 50 μl of 1 M Na2CO3, mix well, NOTE STOP TIME
measurement of Abs (420nm) and Abs (550nm)
The Miller Units were calculated according to the following equation:
Miller Units = 1000 * (ABS420 - (1.75 * ABS550)) / (time [min] * volume [ml] * ABS600)
The reaction time was 5 min and the culture volume used was 10 µl.

Testing the spectrometer (at the wavelengths 420 and 600 nm, because they are used in the Miller Assay: over which range are the OD values linear?)
samples:
for 600 nm measurements: 170 µl of a bacterial culture in LB medium, blank with fresh LB medium, dilutions in LB medium (minor problem: cells could still grow during the experiment, especially as the plate reader heated the plate)
for 420 nm measurements: 130 µl of one sample of Miller Assay from 13-09-2011 (had already been developed/stopped and stored o/n at RT), blank with ddH2O, dilutions in ddH2O
Results
Miller Assay Results
The Miller Assay yielded the following data set:
The data shows that the cultures induced by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) yield higher Miller Units than the uninduced control after 60 min. Therefore, a higher amount of β-galactosidase was produced. This shows that the part is working as expected. Furthermore a slight quantitative dependence of the Miller Units on the concentration of IPTG can be seen. After 120 min the Miller Units of the culture induced with 1.0 mM IPTG go down again, which might be evidence for increasing of proteolysis caused by death of bacteria due to a too high concentration of IPTG. It can also be observed that the uninduced control yields higher Miller Units than the β-galactosidase negative, induced control. This can be explained by leaky biosynthesis of the genome-coded T7 polymerase. If the production of T7 polymerase is more tightly controlled, the level of expressed β-galactosidase should go down to the minimum of the negative, induced control.

Cloning
Picking of clones
3 colonies were picked each from plates 2, 3 (Part BBa_K568003 in pSB1C3) and 4, 5 (Part BBa_568002 in pSB1C3) and then inoculated in 5 ml LB Cam each. The cultures were incubated at 37°C over night for miniprep tomorrow.
Cloning of  Part BBa_K568004
To ligate the synthetic construct (cut yesterday with E, S) with T7ptag in pSB1C3, the following digestion was done:
After the digestion was completed, the sample was loaded onto a preparative 1 % agarose gel. After electrophoresis at 120 V, the correct bands were cut out on the transilluminator (365 nm, make sure UV lamp isn't switched on longer than absolutely necessary). Subsequently, the following gel photo was recorded:
pSB1C3 with T7ptag is 4743 bp long, which corresponds with the location of the cut-out band.
As a next step, the DNA was purified from the gel slice using the Promega Wizard Kit. The concentration of the product was determined to be 6 ng/µl using Nanodrop. This value is not reliable, but for lack of a second, quick way to measure the DNA concentration, the following ligation was perpared using the value nevertheless. Incubation of the Ligation occurred over night at 16 °C.
The product of yesterday's ligation was purified using glycogen-ethanol-precipitation (see methods). The product was stored at -20°C for transformation tomorrow.

Restriction digest and control gel
To check whether the prepped DNA samples contained the correct parts, the following digestion was performed:
After the digest was completed, the samples were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the following gel photo was recorded:
All bands look fine. Samples 1-6 correspond to the minipreps of K568003. Here the insert is 3147 bp and the vector is 2070 bp long. The bands verify this. Samples 7 - 12 correspond to the minipreps of K568002, which has an insert of 3187 bp and the same 2070 bp vector. Again, the bands show that this is correct.
Glycogen/ethanol precipitation
Yesterday's ligation was purified using glycogen/ethanol precipitation. The yielded DNA samples were used for transformation
Transformations
The transformations listed below were carried out. After electroporation the cells were incubated in 1 ml SOC medium for 1 h at 37 °C before plating.
For Redlight Sensor Characterization
All plasmids were electroporated into the new electrocompetent CP919 cells for characterization of the red light sensor later this week.
Plate Number 1: Part K322127 in pSB1C3 (tube label "K322127 miniprep 04.09.2011"). Plated onto LB Cam plate.
Plate Number 2: Part K568000 (tube label "5.9.11, 2 vom 1.9, redlight in pSB1C3, 83 ng/µl"). This is our PCR product (redlight sensor). Plated onto LB Cam plate.
Plate Number 3: cph8 in pSB1A3 (tube label "cph8 Miniprep 4.9.11"). Plated onto both LB Amp.
For generation of Part BBa_K568004
The purified products of yesterday's ligation were electroporated  into DH5alpha and plated onto LB Cam plates.
Plate Number 4: Ligation 1 (16-09-2011), pSB1C3 T7ptag with synthetic construct, ligation ratio I:V = 5.
Plate Number 5: Ligation 2 (16-09-2011), pSB1C3 T7ptag with synthetic construct, ligation ratio I:V = 10.
Plate Number 6: Ligation 3 (16-09-2011), pSB1C3 T7ptag with synthetic construct, ligation ratio I:V = 15.
Plate Number 7: Ligation 4 (16-09-2011), vector background pSB1C3 T7ptag.
The purified products of the ligation performed on 15-09-2011 were electroporated into DH5alpha, just to make sure that the part is really contained in pSB1A3 and not pSB1C3. Therefore, the transformed cells were plate onto LB Amp and LB Cam plates. The plate Number refers to the LB Amp plate as well as the LB Cam plate in all cases.
Plate Number 8: Ligation 1 (15-09-2011), positive control pSB1A3 single cut

Plate Number 12: Ligation 5 (15-09-2011) vector background pSB1A3 T7ptag (purify 1.9.)
For cloning of I746907 into pSB6A1
We want to use I746907 as a reporter part for our optogenetical AND-gate in e. coli CP919. Therefore the part must be transformed into a low copy vector, since the AND-gate is in pSB1C3 which is a high copy vector. Because CP919 already has a Kan-Resistance, the low copy vector used for this needs to carry Amp-Resistance. That's why we chose pSB6A1, a low copy vector with Amp-Resistance. The DNA was gained from 2011 Kit Plate 1 well 1K by resuspension in 10 µl ddH2O. This was then used for electroporation into DH5alpha which were plated onto LB Amp plates after transformation.
Plate Number 13: pSB6A1, 0.5 µl DNA used for electroporation
Plate Number 14: pSB6A1, 1.0 µl DNA used for electroporation
Plate Number 15: pSB6A1, 8.5 µl DNA used for electroporation
For Testing of I746907
To be able to characterize part I746907, we used a chemical transformation into BL21 DE3 (see methods). 1.5 µl of the DNA were used (c = 63 ng/µl). The transformed cells were plated onto a LB Amp plate.

Preparation of iGEM-parts for shipping
19-09-2011
People: Simon, Anna
Our Biobricks will be picked up by FedEx today between 1 pm and 3 pm for shipping to the registry. 6 out of 7 Biobricks are ready for take-off, but BBa_K568004 has to be finished in time!
Cloning
Part BBa_K568004
The 9 prepped samples of BBa_K568004 have to be checked for correct sizes of vector and insert. The following digestion was prepared:
Due to time reasons, 10 µl of the sample was digested for 1 min in the microwave at 800 W, while the other 10 µl of the sample were incubated at 37 °C.
The product of quick digest in the microwave was separated using electrophoresis with an analytical 0.8 %  agarose gel. This yielded the following picture:
The bands of all samples look fine. The insert BBa_K568004 is 3069 bp long, the pSB1C3 vector is 2070 bp long. All samples show these bands. We chose sample 8 for shipping, because it looked "cleanest" on the gel.
The product of the "normally" incubated restriction digest (1 h at 37 °C) was also loaded onto an analytical 0.8 % agarose gel. The subsequent electrophoresis resulted in the following picture:
Again, the bands are at the expected positions.
Miniprep of pSB6A1
All six overnight cultures of pSB6A1 in DH5alpha were miniprepped according to metabion's protocol. The cell pellets were pink, indicating that the cells contained the desired plasmid, which carries an RFP-coding sequence as a standard insert. Due to a mistake, the pellet of one sample was lost.
The concentrations were measured using Nanodrop:
Sample 1: c = 93.0 ng/µl
Sample 2: c = 79.0 ng/µl
Sample 3: c = 77.5 ng/µl
Sample 4: c = 86.5 ng/µl
Sample 5: c = 102 ng/µl
Other Work
We prepared the miniprepped pSB1C3 with K568004 for shipping. For used amount see the table found in labbook on 18-09-2011.
Preparations for testing of red light sensor tomorrow:
1 clone was picked from each of the following plates (all plates from transformations performed on 17-09-2011):
Plate 1 (K322127), inoculated in 5 ml LB Cam
Plate 2 (K568000), inoculated in 5 ml LB Cam
Plate 3 (cph8), inoculated in 5 ml LB Amp
Testing
GFP Assay
200 µl of the overnight culture of BL21 (DE3) with I746907 (T7 promotor with GFP) in pSB1A2 were inoculated into 5 ml of fresh LB Amp and incubated for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. Before the samples for measurement in the plate reader were prepared, we made a change of medium to M63, because LB shows slight fluorescence itself.
The measurement using the plate reader occured over night, with heating the plate to 37 °C and shaking it between measurements.
Used filters: excitation filter: 485 nm, emission filter: 520 nm
Problem: Fluorescence was measured every 10 minutes while measurement of Absorbance occured only every 100 minutes. This led to spikes in the diagram.
Results
no concentration dependency of GFP induction (between 1.5 and 0.1 mM IPTG), as IPTG concentration was in saturation range
this table shows measured values with
calculated: Fluorescence/Absorbance
mean of triplicate measurement
adjusted to 100 %
corrected for outliers
shortened to 700 min
ideas for new GFP Assay:
much lower IPTG concentrations
measurement of Absorbance every ten minutes

Cloning
To be able to test the optogenetical AND-Gate in CP919, we need to transform the desired reporter part into a low copy vector. Therefore, BBa_ I746907 will be ligated into pSB6A1.
Digest
The following digest was performed:
After this, the samples were separated by electrophoresis using a preparative 1 % agarose gel. The correct gel bands were cut out on the transilluminator at 365 nm (keep irradiation time as short as possible). After this, the following photo was recorded:
The bands match the expectations.
Samples - : The cut out band around 4 kb is the cut vector pSB6A1, which is 4022 bp long. The band visible at around 1 kb is the RFP coding sequence (1069 bp).
Samples - : Part I746907 is 924 bp long. This corresponds to the cut out bands. The vector pSB1A2 can be seen at 2 kb (it is 2079 bp long).
Ligation
After purification of the DNA from the gel slices using the Promega Wizard Kit, the following ligation was prepared and incubated at 16 °C over night:
Testing
Miller Assay for testing red light sensors
Comparision of the parts:
our red light sensor K568000, the PCR product of K322127, pSB1C3 (C) in cp919
K322127 of the team Edinburgh 2010,  pSB1C3 (C) in cp919
cpH8 in pSB1A3 in cp919 as a negative control
three lighting options:
off light (710 nm)
on light (626 nm)
dark
light sensitive cultures were grown in the dark for five hours prior to the experiment
OD600 around 2.5 (of cultures before dilution at the start of the experiment), dilution in LB medium to about OD = 0.1
Start of Assay: - measurement of Abs(600nm)
- new eppi with 0,5 ml of Zbuffer + 20 μl of freshly prepared 0,1% SDS+ 40 μl of Chloroform (under fume hood) + 420 µl LB Medium + 20 µl sample
- 0,1 ml of the samples are taken and transferred to the Zbuffer
- mix the solution by vortexing for 10 s (all samples equal vortexing time)
- cenrrifugation: 1 min, RT, 4000 rcf
- transferring of 100 μl supernatant to 96 well plate (for photometer)
- initiation of assay with 20 μl of ONPG (4mg/ml) NOTE START TIME
- incubation at 37 °C
- stop reaction with 50 μl of 1 M Na2CO3 NOTE STOP TIME
- measurement of Abs (420nm) and Abs (550nm)
Results
In none of the cells with either the K568000 or the K322127 lacZ could be detected.
possible improvements for further experiments:
make sure, the cells are in log phase, diluting down earlier, e.g. at a OD600 of about 0.7, however cells shouldn't be in lag phase after 210 min, so at least the last values represent lacZ expression in log phase

Wiki freeze day!
Yesterday's ligation was incubated at 65 °C for 10 minutes to heat inactivate the enzymes. The samples were stored at -20 °C and can be used for transformation, as soon as we get to characterizing our optogenetical AND-Gate (BBa_568001). We still hope to generate some data to characterize this part in the near future...
