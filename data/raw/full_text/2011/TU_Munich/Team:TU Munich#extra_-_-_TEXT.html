Collaborations
Uppsala-Sweden
They sent us a copy of their cph8 part. It served us as negative control in the assays for our red light sensor.  In return, we sent them a paper about the EnvZ/OmpR pathway involved in our redlight sensor.
Freiburg-Germany
We had a very encouraging Skype conference with the Freiburg team. We talked about our lab progress and experience with bacterial light sensors. The main topic were the problems regarding ligation of Biobricks.
Wagening UR
We tested their cloning software. Unfortunatly it didn't work for us :(
Edinburgh
They sent us a copy of their part BBa_K322127.
