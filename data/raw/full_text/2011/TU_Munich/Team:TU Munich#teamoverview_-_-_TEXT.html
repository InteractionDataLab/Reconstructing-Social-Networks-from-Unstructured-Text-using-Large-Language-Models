Our Team
Missing: Michael Hoesl (Instructor), Katharina Lachmann
Tobias Neudegger
Studies: Biochemistry (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 23
Growth Factors: Bavarian sky
Bachelor Thesis: "Complement Regulation In Macrophages And Dendritic Cells", Immunology, TUM
Tobi takes most things really easy, except for low temperatures. He needs at least 25 degrees outside to be on fire in the lab.
Nicolas Goeldel
Studies: Biochemistry (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 23
Growth Factors: Meals every 2 hours and inbetween some sleep ;)
Favorite Molecule: Epinephrine
Bachelor Thesis: "Silaffin-induced Biomineralization of CGTase", Protein Chemistry, TUM
Nico is the eloquent head of our operation. Everyone receives a good advice with an impish grin.
Marta Garnelo
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (B.Sc.)
Semester: 4
Age: 21
Growth Factors: Warmth, food, sleep
Favorite Molecule: PG5
Marta is phenomenally talented!! Go and have a look at her self-made pictures. That's all you need to see and you'll know what we are talking about. She created the amazing clay animation movie!
Tobias Schmidt
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (B.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 22
Growth Factors: Half a kilo of yoghurt every day
Favorite Molecule: Melatonin
Tobias is mostly confused and enjoys using the most complicated solution for the simplest problem. Can be seen in the lab trying to get DNA out of bananas for his school project.
Markus Schneider
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (B.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 21
Always carries around a huge backpack containing way more than he could possibly need. Also helped with finding sponsors and the school project.
Alexander Hogrebe
Studies: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Semester: 6
Age: 21
Growth Factors: At least one liter of apple juice every few hours
Favorite Molecule: Miraculin
Bachelor Thesis: "Researching the Role of SLPI During Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses", Center for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, TUM
You should not listen to him too long, if he has not slept enough. Also, he tries to promote our lab work with witchcraft. Hex Hex.
Leonhard v. Meyenn
Studies: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Semester: 6
Age: 21
Bachelor Thesis: "Influence of keratinocyte supernatants on monocyte-derived dendritic cells",  Center of Allergy and Environment Munich (ZAUM)
Leo likes to build LED-supplied disco boxes for our bacteria to grow in.
Fabian Froehlich
Studies: Mathematics (B.Sc.)
Semester: 6
Age: 21
Growth Factors: Some sleep now and then
Favorite Function Space: Besov Space
Bachelor Thesis: Modeling and Analysis of DDEs in Hysteresis for bacterial Quorum Sensing, TUM
Could give a lecture in how to handle a laptop in the most uncomfortable way but all tasks are usually finished by the same day. Likes his coffee best with a tea bag of chamomile.
Alexander Blaessle
Studies: Mathematics (B.Sc.)
Semester: 6
Age: 22
Growth Factors: Beer and sleeping
Favorite Function: wait(realmax) %Do nothing
Bachelor Thesis: A continous and discrete approach to shoal behaviour, Biomathematics, TUM
Our beloved goldfish likes to party and is always ready for an adult beverage. But be aware: keep sentences short and clear when talking to him otherwise he won't remember your words. Trust us!
Thorsten Mueller
Studies: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Semester: 4
Age: 25
Growth Factors: Grows best on some steep rock. Supplement with Tegernseer for maximum growth rate.
Favorite Molecule: Capsaicin
In the end, Thorsten gave up all his social life to stay day and night in the lab to get things work.
Wolfgang Ott
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 24
Growth Factors: Based among other things on traces of roast pork and hop juice
Favorite Reaction: Maillard reaction
Bachelor Thesis: Expression, purification and characterization of anticalins specific for the amyolid beta peptide, Biological Chemistry, TUM
Wolfgang is always quiet and peaceful even if some lab rules should have made him going mad. His solution: He talks more to himself then to others while working in the lab.
Susan Klaeger
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 23
Growth Factors: Cultivable in most climates, overcoming of morning lag-phase only by addition of coffee, expression is induced by chocolate
Favorite Enzyme: MAP kinase kinase kinase
Bachelor Thesis: Detection of Protooncogenes and Tumorsuppressorgenes with Northern Blot Analysis, Livestock Biotechnology, TUM
Whenever you feel bad, just listen to her whistling Biene Maja - and lab is fun again.
Dominik Sievert
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (B.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 21
The flyer man.
Florian Nadler
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 24
Growth Factors: Suitable medium is a balanced mixture of steak and beer; favourite growth temperature is about 35°C, involving sunlight.
Favorite Molecule: DNA
Favorite Enzyme: EC 1.1.1.1
Bachelor Thesis: Virulence determinants of Yersinia frederiksenii
Just call him "The PCR Thermal Cycler Whisperer". He first brought up the idea of a bacterial 3D-printer.
Simon Heinze
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (B.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 21
Growth Factors: A fishing rod and music, optional supplement: a glass of shiraz
Favoite Microorganism: Magnetospirillum Magnetotacticum
Laid-back and doesn't mind doing tasks that nobody likes, for example keeping track of the finances. Probably one of very few people (besides Anna) to ever record absorption spectra of various solid growth media.
Anna Kramer
Studies: Biochemistry (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 23
Growth Factors: Obligate aerobic, natural sunlight
Favorite Supplement: Gingerol
Bachelor Thesis: "Fabrication and testing of microelectrode arrays for the development of protein based biosensors for specific detection of cells", department of biotechnology, University of Leipzig
Anna was sent to get money from the president of our university but instead came back with him as our patron. During her time in the lab she fell in love with our cool plate reader.
Beatrice Ramm
Studies: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Semester: 4
Age: 21
Growth Factors: Chips and many nice people around
Favorite Microorganism: Chlamydomonos Rheinhardtii
Bea is somehow like a "Perpetuum Mobile". Once started she talks all day long while doing 10 things at the time without loss of energy.
Leah Mallm
Studies: Biochemistry (B.Sc.)
Semester: 4
Age: 21
Growth Factors: Grows best in the middle of a forest with pasta and chocolate
Favorite Microorganism: Vibrio Fischeri
When having a look on her bench you might get the idea that she is a compulsive hoarder. She backslided into childhood cultivating Hermann for our Human projects in her's and Bea's fridge.
Katharina Lachmann
Studies: Molecular Biotechnology (M.Sc.)
Semester: 2
Age: 24
Growth Factors: summer, sun, beach and ocean... otherwise coffee, chocolate and good friends

This year our team consists of 19 students and 3 instructors. We are proud to represent the degree programmes Biochemistry, Molecular Biotechnology as well as Mathematics with students in their second to eighth semester. Just as last year our lab and office is graciously provided by the E14 Chair for Biomolecular Systems and Bionanotechnology (Simmel Lab).
