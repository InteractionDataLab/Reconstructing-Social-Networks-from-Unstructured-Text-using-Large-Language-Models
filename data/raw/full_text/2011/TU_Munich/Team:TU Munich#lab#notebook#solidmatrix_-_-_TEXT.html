Light transmission of solid agar, different agar concentrations and growth media
Purpose:
In order to create the 3D-Printer based on a double-light-sensitive-promotor, it is not only necessary to immobilize the cells within a solid medium but also to be able to induce the protein expression at a definied spot. Thus, we want to examine the light transmission properties of different solid media.
Procedure:
To gain data on the light transmission of different solid media, different compositions of media were produced and poured into 1 ml cuvettes while they were still liquid. After gelation, a transmission spectrum (230 nm - 750 nm) was recorded for each sample

Results
The transmission spectra were saved locally on the lab-computer (upload?)
LB-medium has low tranmission values at shorter wavelengths (hence its yellow appearance) and should therefore be avoided in our experiment if possible. If a clear medium (such as M9) is sufficient for our purposes it should be chosen. It has no significant absorbtion of blue light, which makes the application of a promotor sensitive to blue light feasible.
Gels prepared with Agarose were clearer than those prepared with Agar-Agar.
The transmission values are higher at lower concentrations of the gelling agent.

Is a glas or plastic container neccessary for solid media?
Purpose:
We figured that if we could do without a glas or plastic container surrounding the solid medium, this would increase the precision of our light-beam aiming at the cells that are to be induced (no light refraction at the container walls, etc.).
Procedure:
To examine if it is possible to make a detachted, self-supporting block of agar, we made a 40 ml block of 0.5 % (w/v) Agar with M9-Medium in a small beaker glass. After the gellation process we turned it out and left it to stand over night.
Results
The block had lost a lot of water over night, so that it was standing in a puddle. Therefore it's not possible to make a detachted, self-supporting block of agar (0.5 % w/v).

Alternative growth media and gelling agents
Purpose:
The purpose of this part of the experiment is to test different gelling agents known from everyday life. As it had turned out in experiment 1.1, a very clear gel is required. From cooking, we know that gelatine and jelly glaze provide quite clear gels.
Procedure:
Three different gelling agents were tested:
1) "Küchle Blitzguss", a jelly glaze that doesn't require heating
2) "RUF Tortenguss klar", a normal jelly glaze that has to be boiled
3) Gelatine
For each substance, three different concentrations were prepared M9:
1) according to the recipe
2) with half the amount of liquid added
3) with twice the amount of liquid added
For each of these, three cuvettes were prepared and a transmission spectrum was recorded after gelation.
Results
The jelly glazes are not suitable for our purposes, because they yield very soft gels at low concentrations and very murky gels at higher concentrations. Gelatine is not a good choice either, because it takes a long time to solidify.

Mixing gelling agents with bacterial cultures
Testing of 5 different gelling agents for O2-permeability and stability mixed with B. subtilis and E. Coli. Agents were mixed with 9 ml of LB and 1 ml of liquid culture and incubated at 37° C o/n.
1) Agar-Agar 0.5 %
2) Gelatine 1.8 % (w/v)
3) "Blitz-Guss" 5.9 % (w/v) cold
4) "Tortenguss" 0.9 % (w/v) warm
5) Agarose 0,5 %
Results
Agar + B. Subtilis: upper 3 mm slightly red, gel was stable
Agar + E. Coli: Bubbles within Agar, little fluid on top, gel was stable
Gelatine + B. Subtilis: fluid and clear
Gelatine + E. Coli: fluid and little precipitations at the bottom
Blitz-Guss + B. Subtilis: fluid and unclear
Blitz-Guss + E. Coli: fluid and unclear
Tortenguss + B. Subtilis: fluid and clear
Tortenguss + E. Coli: liquid and unclear
Agarose + B. Subtilis: stable gel
Agarose + E. Coli: stable gel and little bubbles
conclusion:
All fluid gelling agents are not suitable. Clear gels are not suitable because no bacterial growth took place. Only Agarose and Agar-Agar remained suitable but small bubbles could be a problem. The Experiment with B. Subtilis showed that oxygen is only available in the upper 3 mm of the gels.

18 ml of gelling agent was heated, cooled down to 40° C, poured into a petri dish with 1 ml AHL (final concentration in petri dish: 100 nM) and 1 ml E. Coli (express GFP with inducer AHL) culture in LB.
GELRITE gelled immediately upon contact with cold petri dish. --> all components have to be warmed to aprox. 50° C

GELRITE gel was damaged because of strong rotating forces. All three samples were viewed under the fluorescence microscope: Bacteria were clustered, oftentimes two next to each other (doubled?), still fluorescent (inducer works with as little as 5 nM) ---> bacteria alive

light scattering in gels
0.25 % GELRITE was produced:  25 ml M9 and 0,15 g GELRITE was heated and then mixed with 5 ml of a dense E. Coli suspension (OD = ca. 10) in M9 and poured into a cuvette. Transmission was measured with a absorption photometer.
Quick gelling of GELRITE was again a problem. Spectra showed higher transmissions in blue and UV ranges than Agarose and Agar-Agar spectra before. A very high density of cell culture lead to a decrease in transmission of about 95%. Media:0,25%_Gelrite_with-without_cells.pdf‎
---> Cells lead to a great decrease in light trasmission ---> we have to quantify this

Other Work
Findings from literature:  M9 shouldn't be used in a lower concentration than 1 x to ensure growth of E. coli. However, 1x M9 includes a lot of salt, which leads to early gelling of GELRITE (0,5 % GELRITE (w/v) at 47° C in 1 x M9)
-> testing of different GELRITE concentrations with 1x M9
0,1 % GELRITE with stirring: gelling at 43 - 44° C, however rather sirupy due to stirring 0,1 % GELRITE without stirring: gelling at 44° C, however not a very stable gel
-> for a somewhat stable gel, 44° C is the lowest temperature in 1x M9 and GELRITE
repetition with 0,5 % Agarose: gelling at 30° C and transmission spectrum taken  -> low gelling temperature but murky gel
permeability of gels
0,5 % Agarose (about 10 ml) in a plastic syringe with blue water (with ink) on the top, without and with pressure -> no water drops out of the syringe, even when pressure is applied (rather the gel is pressed out) -> no permeability for water
0,5 % GELRITE in the same setup over night: no permeability for water, ink diffused into the gel
inoculation of 30 ml LB medium with E. coli (BW27785) and used for experiments on 18-04-2011

Testing of Silica Sol-Gels
according to "Immobilization of bacteria in silica matrices using citric acid in the sol–gel process" Alvarez et al. (DOI 10.1007/s006-00253-0580-6)
6 ml of ddH2O were added to 1g silica and heated to 80° C untill full colloidal suspension was achieved. The suspension was cooled to room temperature und either pH 6.5 was set with 0.75 M citric acid or the suspension was mixed 1:1 with 1.8 x 10^8 cfu/ml E.Coli. After 2 minutes the gelling should occur.
Results
It was impossible to gain homogenous gelling with both methods. Mixing with bacterial culture didnt result in gelling at all. After addition of citric acid the suspension gelled inhomogenous and immediately at basic pH values (ca. 10.2). Furthermore sol gels are not transparent enough and Transmission in blue wavelengths is low.

Testing of Silica Sol-Gels II
The experiment from 18-04-2011 was repeated using Natronwasserglas (silicic acid) and silicon dioxide (Kieselgel 60) according to Alvarez et al with the same results as above.
Adjustment of E. Coli cell count in GELRITE-Gels
Aim: maximum cell count determination as regards to transmission of visible light
Preparation of 0.5 % GELRITE-gels
0.15 g GELRITE were added to 25 ml M9-medium. The solution was heated to aproximately 90° C (or 100% of GELRITE was dissolved) and cooled down to 50° C in a water bath. 5 ml bacterial suspension with apropriate cell count was heated to 50° C and poured imediately into the GELRITE solution. Mixture was stirred thoroughly and poured into petri dishes or cuvettes. Gelling should occur immediately after contact with cold plastic surface. (at 47° C)
Following in-gel cell counts were produced:
1x107 cells/ml: pic spectrum
1x108 cells/ml: pic spectrum
1x109 cells/ml: pic spectrum
Media:Variation_of_cell_density 04-11-19.jpg
results:
Cell count has to be somewhere between 1x108 and 1x109 cells/ml in regards to efficient transmission. Space between single E. Coli cells is to high.

Gel slices werent properly homogenized. Probably most cells survived heating step for under 1 minute duration. Cell counts 6.00E-08 and 8.00E-08 had to be heated twice due to too early gelling of GELRITE. Viable cell count decreases here significantly.
--> keep heating duration as short as possible (under 1 minute)

gel with more components
Testing bacteria in the Gelrite matrix with more medium components:
- heat resistant E. coli  BH28 under Kan resisitance
- positive control with lacZ, induceable with Arabinose, under Amp resistance
0,35 % Gelrite (for delayed gelling -> did't change so much, gelling at 47 °C)
M9 medium
1 mg/ml ammonium iron sulfate
2 mg/ml arabinose
-> cooked to dissolve components
bacteria (final concentration in the gel 1*10^7 bact./ml)
added with the bacteria / not cooked / heated to ca. 50 ° C in water bath: 0,3 mg/ml S-Gal (from 50 mg/ml stock in DMF -> stock can be found in our freezer, brownish liquid in eppi)
antibiotic 100 µg/ml Medium
problems:
- premature gelling
- blurry gel
- light brownish color (like S-Gal in DMF)

-> idea from Bea: use S-Gal powder instead of stock solution (organic solvent may cause blurry gel)
-> as bacteria suvived: mix at higher temperatures to avoid premature gelling
