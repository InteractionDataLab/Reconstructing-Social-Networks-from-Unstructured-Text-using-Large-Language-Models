The 2010 Team
The last years team aim was to develop an arbitrarily extendable system, that assembles biological components to an in vivo network and thereby allows logical information processing.
By developing a biological network that is constructed in a similar manner as a personal computer, they wanted to provide Science with the feasibility to program cells and build logical networks based on AND/OR/NOT between Biobricks. This would allow functional connections between Biobricks and would give them a stronger brick characteristic.
To realise this they engineered simple and easy-to-handle switches based on predictable RNA/RNA-interactions regulating transcriptional termination. These switches represent a complete set of logical functions and are capable of forming arbitrarily complex networks.
They won a Gold Medal in iGEM 2010
