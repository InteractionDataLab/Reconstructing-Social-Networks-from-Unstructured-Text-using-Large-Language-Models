The building block of a database is the record. A record           is a collection of related data treated as a single entity. For example,           a hockey trading card could be called a record: it brings together the           name, photograph, team, and statistics of one player.
An introduction to our web site
A collection of records that share the same fields is called a table           because this kind of information can easily be presented in table           format: each column represents a field and each row represents a record.           In fact, the word column is synonymous with the word field, and the word row is synonymous with the word record.
