Data for our new parts
Main Page – PcstA_RFP generator, BBa_K572001: Carbon stress induced promoter when induced by Carbon stress produces RFP. RFP production was seen to increase with decrease in substrate concentration.
Main Page – Proteorhodopsin, BBa_K572005: Gene expressing proteorhodopsin (Green light absorbing Proteorhodopsin), native to Marine Gamma Proteobacterium. It has light dependent proton pumping activity.
Main Page – Light based Cloning vector, BBa_K572100: Cloning Plasmid based on pSB1C3, Chloramphenicol is replaced by Proteorhodopsin. This plasmid can be used for light based screening.
Main Page – Light based Expression vector, BBa_K572200:  designed based on pSB1C3, for improved expression in carbon limiting conditions, using light as substrate
Data for pre-existing parts
Experience – PcstA (glucose-repressible promoter), BBa_K118011: This is a carbon stress induced promoter. We characterized this part by designing and expressing a composite part BBa_K572001, which expressed RFP. We found increasing expression for decreasing substrate concentration.
We've also characterized:
Main Page – Mouse Beta Carotene Dioxygenase, BBa_K572009: Gene coding for Beta carotene dioxygenase, it converts beta carotene to All-trans retinal which is the chromophore in Proteorhodopsin. We tried to characterize Beta carotene utilization efficiency of this part, for various media conditions.
