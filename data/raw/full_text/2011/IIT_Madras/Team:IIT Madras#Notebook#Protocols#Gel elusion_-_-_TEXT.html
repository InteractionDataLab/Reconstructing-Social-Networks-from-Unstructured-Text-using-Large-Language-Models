Gel Elusion
Prepare a 0.8% low melthing agarose gel.
Add 50 ul preparative reaction product into large wells.
Run the gel at 100 V for 30 – 45 mins.
Cut the gel with restricted DNA and keep it in an microfuge tube.
To the cut DNA, add 3 volumes of Chaotropic salt. Incubate at 50 C for 10 minutes.
Add 10 ul of GPS (Glass Powder Solution) for a PCR product and 15 ul for a vector and incubate at Room Temperature for 10 mins. Shake the tubes continuously so that GPS is in suspension and doesn’t settle down.
Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 rpm for 2 minutes and discard supernatant.
Wash pellet by adding 50 volumes of wash buffer. That is, 500 ul of Wash buffer for insert and 750 ul for vector.
Resuspend the pellet in 20 ul of water and heat at 50 C for 10 minutes. Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 rpm for 2 mins. Store supernatant at -20 C.
