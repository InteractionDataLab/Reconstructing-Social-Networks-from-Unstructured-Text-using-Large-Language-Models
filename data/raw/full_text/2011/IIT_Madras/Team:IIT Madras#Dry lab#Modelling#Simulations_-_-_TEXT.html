Simulations for Proof of Concept
Concept: Increase in cell growth rate due to Proteorhodopsin in Carbon stress conditions.
Simulations for Proof of Concept: We varied glucose uptake rates in the range 0.5-12 mmol/g-dw hr and calculated growth rates for Model_WT and Model_PR. Observing percentage increase in growth rate we could deduce the advantage given to cell due to Proteorhodopsin’s light driven proton efflux.
Observations: As the glucose uptake rate was reduced the advantage to the cell due to Proteorhodopsin in terms of growth rate increased. Upto 30% increase in growth rate (See Figure 1 & 2) can be observed due to Proteorhodopsin at high carbon stress  conditions.
Figure 1 and 2 : % Increase in growth rate observed due to Proteorhodopsin (Proton efflux = 2 and 10 mmol/g-dw hr) for varying glucose uptake rates respectively.
According to the model the following reactions showed major flux changes due to Proteorhodopsin :
'adentylate kinase GTP '
'adenosine hydrolase'
'dihydroorotic acid menaquinone 8
'3 isopropylmalate dehydrogenase'
'psicoselysine transport via proton symport periplasm
'purine nucleoside phosphorylase Deoxyadenosine '
'L threonine via sodium symport periplasm '
Reaction Knockout Analysis of    '3 isopropylmalate dehydrogenase'  was lethal and  the other reactions didn’t have major effects on growth rates .
