Protocols
Preparation of Competent DH5alpha Cells
Autoclave 0.1 M CaCl2 in 20% glycerol.
Primary culture in 5 ml of LB broth for 16 hours.
Add 1 ml of primary culture into 50 ml of media for secondary culture.
Check OD at 600 nm.
Incubate secondary cultures at 37 C in a shaker.
Check OD600 after 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours.
Keep the cells on ice (for 10 minutes) for harvesting as soon as OD600 reaches 0.4 (0.4 -0.6 is the range).
Pellet down the cells at 6000 rpm for 10 min (4 C ).
(Each 50 ml culture can be added to 50 ml falcon tubes)
Add 10 ml of ice cold 0.1M CaCl2.
Re-suspend the pellet and keep on ice for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min (4 C).
Re-suspend the pellet in 5 ml ice cold 0.1 M CaCl2 Solution.
Again, keep on ice for 10 min. and centrifuge at 6000 rpm for 10 min.
. Re-suspend the pellet in 2 ml ice cold 0.1 M CaCl2 Solution. Alliquot 100 ul into a number of tubes and store them at -80 C.
Transformation
Add 2 ul of Plasmid DNA to competent cells (100 ul aliquot) on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock : 90 s for 43 C.
Keep on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 900 ul of LB broth (sterile) into each microfuge tubes.
Incubate in shaker at 37 C for 1 hour.
Plate on plates (with antibiotics if necessary) and incubate at 37 C overnight.
Miniprep Using Alkaline Lysis Buffers
For 5 ml Cultures: 12 – 16 hours incubation.
For 50 ml cultures: 8 hours of primary (2ml) and 16 hours of secondary (50 ml) add 50 ul.
Pellet down the cells at 12000 rpm for 2 min. Use same eppendorf for 5 ml cultures. Remove all the media from pellet.
Add ice cold Soln 1, 250 ul, Vortex well. Incubate in ice for 5 min.
Add fresh soln II, 250 ul. Invert mix. Incubate at Room temperature for 5 min.
Add ice cold soln III, 250 ul. Invert mix. Incubate on ice for 5 min.
Add RNase, and incubate at 43 C for half an hour.
Add equal volume of Phenol Chloroform. Vortex well. Centrifuge at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes. Take the supernatant.
Add 0.6 volumes (~450 ul) of isopropanol. Shake well. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Centrifuge at 12000 rpm 4 C. 10 minutes.
Discard isopropanol. Wash pellet with 70% ethanol. Spin and Drain Ethanol.
Let tubes dry at 37 C till the eppendorfs don’t smell of ethanol.
Add 20 ul – 50 ul autoclaved MilliQ wateror (10mM Tris+1mM EDTA) with RNase. Leave for 30 mins at 43 C if RNase is added.
Reagents
Lysis Buffer 1
50mM -- Glucose
25mM -- TRIS-Cl (pH 8.0)
10mM -- EDTA (pH 8.0)
Autoclave and store at 4 C
Lysis Buffer 2
8ml -- Water
1ml -- 10% SDS
1ml -- 2N NaOH
Lysis Buffer 3 (for 100ml)
60ml -- 5M Sodium Acetate
11.5ml -- Glacial Acetic Acid
28.5ml -- Water
Check pH. It should/will be around 5.2-5.4. Autoclave & store at 4 C.
Gel Elution
Prepare a 0.8% low melthing agarose gel
Add 50 ul preparative reaction product into large wells
Run the gel at 100 V for 30 – 45 mins
Cut the gel with restricted DNA and keep it in an eppendorf
To the cut DNA, add 3 volumes of Chaotropic salt. Incubate at 50 C for 10 minutes
Add 10 ul of GPS (Glass Powder Solution) for a PCR product and 15 ul for a vector and incubate at Room Temperature for 10 mins. Shake the tubes continuously so that GPS is in suspension and doesn’t settle down.
Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 rpm for 2 minutes and discard supernatant.
Wash pellet by adding 50 volumes of wash buffer. That is, 500 ul of Wash buffer for insert and 750 ul for vector.
Resuspend the pellet in 20 ul of water and heat at 50 C for 10 minutes. Centrifuge the tubes at 12000 rpm for 2 mins. Store supernatant at -20 C.
