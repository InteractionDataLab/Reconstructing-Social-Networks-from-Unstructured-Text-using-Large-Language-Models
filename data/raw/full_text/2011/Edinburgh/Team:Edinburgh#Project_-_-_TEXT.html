Designs
The general formats for the basic phage and cell display would be:
Promoter-RBS-LeaderSequence-Enzyme-(Linker?)-pVIII
Promoter-RBS-INP-(Linker?)-Enzyme
Actions that ought to be carried out
General
Make or acquire fusion-ready cellulases (e.g. <partinfo>BBa_K392006</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K392007</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K392008</partinfo>).
Since a simple test system is desired, make fusion-ready amylase, from E. coli's own malS gene.
Make or acquire spacer/linker sequences?
Short linkers could be ordered as oligos. Berkeley 2009 made some longer linkers which we could order.
Phage display
Acquire M13 phage.
PCR from our M13mp18 to get:
pVIII mature protein
pVIII leader sequence, coding for: MKKSLVLKASVAVATLVPMLSFA.
Make or acquire fusion-ready pIII gene? (optional)
See <partinfo>BBa_K415138</partinfo> (complete) or <partinfo>BBa_K257001</partinfo> (sans leader sequence).
Our final fusion will need the leader sequence followed by the gene of interest followed by pIII proper.
Cell display
Make or acquire fusion-ready cell-surface display parts.
See Berkeley 2009 (but perhaps ignore them).
Instead, <partinfo>BBa_K265008</partinfo> (ice nucleation protein) looks promising.
The fliC gene seems to be the target for flagella display; note that the displayed protein has to be inserted into the middle of it.
Biorefinery
To add...
Completion
Fuse whatever enzymes to cell-display parts or pVIII or maybe pIII.

Profit!
