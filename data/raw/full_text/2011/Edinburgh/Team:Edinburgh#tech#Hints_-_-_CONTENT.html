Instead, long overhangs of homologous DNA are used to join the fragments, and the transformed bacterium repairs the phosphate backbone.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="f_hint">The <I>F plasmid</I> is present in some bacteria, and contains genes coding for a sex pilus, which the plasmid uses to spread itself to other bacteria. The M13 phage requires the pilus to be present in order to infect <I>E. coli</I>.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="codon_hint">A <I>codon</I> is a sequence of three DNA bases, coding for one amino acid in a protein.

It is often used in genetic engineering as a reporter; i.e. to prove that a system is working.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="fitness_hint"><I>Fitness</I> is the ability of an organism to compete with other organisms and successfully reproduce. If an organism outcompetes other organisms it is said to have greater fitness. Such an organism will spread.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="algorithm_hint">An <I>algorithm</I> is a method of computing some function. It consists of a finite number of steps which you need to follow, to get the desired result.<SMALL>Examples: The annoying program inside a PCR machine, a flight checklist, or a pasta recipe.</SMALL></DIV><DIV class="hint" id="recombination_hint"><I>Recombination</I> is a natural process in which different pieces of DNA are joined together. Complex organisms use this process to combine the DNA of two parents during sex, while simpler organisms use it to repair damaged DNA by replacing it with an undamaged copy.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="cellulose_hint"><I>Cellulose</I> is a tough plant material composed of chains of glucose sugar. Unlike starch (which is also a glucose chain) it is difficult to digest or degrade, so making usable sugar from it is hard.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="starch_hint"><I>Starch</I> is an easily degradable chain of glucose sugars used by plants as a food store.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="selectionpressure_hint">In evolution, a <I>selection pressure</I> exists when some external factor causes some members of a species to outcompete others, due to their having a genotype that is more suitable for the environment.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="synonymouscodon_hint">In genetics, <I>synonymous codons</I> are different 3-base sequences that code for the same amino acid. For example, CAA and CAG both code for glutamine. By using synonymous codons, different DNA sequences can code for the same protein.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="plasmid_hint"><I>Plasmids</I> are small circular pieces of DNA which replicate independently of the main bacterial chromosome. They are relatively easy to manipulate and so are used in genetic engineering.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="artificialselection_hint"><I>Artificial selection</I> is the process where humans choose or influence which members of a species reproduce the most, thus altering the genetic makeup of the population.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="rfc10_hint"><I>RFC10</I> is the original BioBrick standard. It specifies how restriction sites are to be placed in flanking positions around the BioBrick. Most iGEM-related parts are made in this format.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="homology_hint">Two sequences of DNA have <I>homology</I> if the same sequence is present in both of them. Homology-based assembly relies on using base-pairing to join two pieces of DNA which have homologous ends, the start of one piece matching the end of the other.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="frameshift_hint">A <I>frameshift</I> mutation in a gene involves the addition or deletion of a non-multiple of three bases. Because triplets of bases (codons) code for amino acids, subsequent codons will be &quot;out of frame&quot; and will code for the wrong amino acids.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="synbio_hint"><I>Synthetic biology</I> is a broad range of disciplines, unified by the desire to take an engineering approach to biology. It is like genetic engineering, only more so.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="presbyterian_hint">A <I>presbyterian</I> church is one governed by elected elders.

Agents can perform actions of a varying level of complexity. Often, representing a system as many agents lets the programmer model complex behaviour using simple rules.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="syntax_hint">The <I>syntax</I> of a (programming) language is the set of rules that result in working programs.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="rk_hint">The <I>Runge-Kutta</I> methods are ways of generating an approximately correct solution to an ordinary differential equation.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="deterministic_hint">A system is <I>deterministic</I> if future states of the system can be perfectly predicted from past states. Such a system does not incorporate any genuine randomness.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="intractable_hint">A program is <I>computationally intractable</I> if it is <I>possible</I> to compute its output, but it takes an awful lot of time - e.g. exponential on the length of input.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="adsorption_hint"><I>Adsorption</I> is the process in which molecules bind to a surface.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="hydrolysis_hint"><I>Hydrolysis</I> is a type of chemical reaction in which water molecules are split up into a proton (H<SUP>+</SUP>) and a hydroxide (OH<SUP>â</SUP>) during the process of breaking down some other substance.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="empirical_hint">To call some piece of knowledge <I>empirical</I> is to say that it is derived from data and evidence, rather than purely theoretical considerations.</DIV><DIV class="hint" id="cellobiose_hint"><I>Cellobiose</I> is a type of sugar containing two molecules of glucose bonded together in a certain way.
