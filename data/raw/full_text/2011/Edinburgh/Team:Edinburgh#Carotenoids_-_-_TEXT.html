Hover over words in bold italics to see explanation.
A nice test of BioSandwich assembly would be to physically link the crtE, crtB, and crtI proteins; these form part of a carotenoid synthesis pathway (see Edinburgh's 2008 and 2007 projects).
The whole gene cluster in Pantoea ananatis is shown here .
Are all the proteins monomeric? How would we find out?
