Conclusions
In our abstract, we asked a number of questions that our feasibility study was intended to answer.
Would the efficiency of cellulases be increased by having different types close together?
Very probably. Our C model and Kappa model showed that synergy makes sense in silico.
Could this be done by displaying them on a cell outer membrane?
This seems a promising approach. BBa_K265008 seems a promising carrier for placing enzymes at high copy number on the E. coli outer membrane.
Could it be done by displaying them on a phage?
Further work is needed to answer this question. There are theoretical reasons to expect that this is a challenging problem.
Does the BioSandwich DNA assembly method work properly?
Like other homology-based assembly methods, it produces both correct and incorrect assemblies .
How would a biorefinery involving either system actually be constructed?
Our biorefinery page includes a process flow diagram that illustrates this.
Would such a biorefinery be economically viable?
Our biorefinery page also attempts to answer this question. We cannot definitively answer the question, but it is plausible that such a biorefinery could be economically viable. A significant investment would undoubtedly be required.
What are the social implications of creating such a biorefinery?
Our interviewees drew our attention to a number of issues: consent and safety of local communities; sustainable sourcing of raw materials; and relations between the developed and developing world. All these issues must be kept in mind.
What are people's thoughts and feelings regarding this project?
There is cautious optimism. If the feedstock for the biorefinery is mere waste, many people would view it favourably. On the other hand, if land is diverted from food crops to fuel crops, this would be broadly opposed.
Should we (meaning society) actually build such a biorefinery?
We feel that it is not our place to answer this question. We cannot decide for society; society must make a fully-informed decision.
