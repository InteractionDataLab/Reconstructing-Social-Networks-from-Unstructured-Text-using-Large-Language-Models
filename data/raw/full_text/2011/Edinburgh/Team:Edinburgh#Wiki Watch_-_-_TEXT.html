I carried out my orders until arrested. I had no sense that I was
spying, and I ask that this be taken into account in deciding my verdict.

In order to help collaboration between teams, as well as for our own enlightenment, we put together the following list of projects. This page is now linked from the Community page, and we hope others have found it useful.
Descriptions here might be incorrect for teams that switched project in the first few weeks. As of September 9, full team abstracts are available .
High School teams are not shown (unless participating in the main event). Teams that withdrew without making substantive wiki edits have been hidden. Teams that advanced to the finals in MIT are highlighted.
