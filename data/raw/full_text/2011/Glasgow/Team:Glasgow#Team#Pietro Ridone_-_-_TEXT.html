Ciao I'm Pietro, i was born and raised in Florence but i've been living in glasgow for the past three years and i'm now about to start my 4th year in Biotechnology at Glasgow University. I'm mega-excited to participate to this year's igem, my colleagues are great and i'd love to work in the synthetic biology field again in the future. FORZA Glasgow!
