Stock of Promoters and Ribosome Binding Sites
We have successfully created a stock of all the promoters and ribosome binding sites ligated to each other.
Strong Promoter + Strong RBS
Strong Promoter + Weak RBS
Weak Promoter + Strong RBS
Weak Promoter + Weak RBS
pBAD promoter + Strong RBS
pBAD promoter + Weak RBS
Bluf promoter + Strong RBS
Bluf promoter + Weak RBS
OmpF promoter + Strong RBS
OmpF promoter + Weak RBS
OmpC promoter + Strong RBS
OmpC promoter + Weak RBS
As these constructs were made using AlwnI and gel extraction, any colony that successfully grew must have worked. However these parts were not present on the submission plasmid (pSB1C3).
The whole fragment was digested out of the plasmid using EcoRI and PstI, and ligated into the linear submission vector.  At this stage only the following constructs successfully grew and were confirmed to be the right size on a gel:
Bluf Promoter + Strong RBS
Bluf Promoter + Weak RBS
OmpF + Weak RBS
pBAD + Strong RBS
Weak Promoter + Strong RBS
Strong Promoter + Strong RBS
Weak Promoter + Weak RBS
Gels 1 to 4 show the Promoter + RBS constructs we made that were ligated into the submission vector and found to be the expected size
