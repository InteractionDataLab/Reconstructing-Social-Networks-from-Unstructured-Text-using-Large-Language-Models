Biobrick: Phosphodiesterase (PDE)
Host:
E.coli Top 10
Origin:
Amplified from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome
Function & Use:
Phosphodiesterases are a family of enzymes naturally present in microorganisms, which break phosphodiester bonds.  The specific enzyme we are using breaks the phosphodiester bond in the second messenger nucleotide, cyclic digaunylate (cyclic-di-GMP).  Cyclic-di-GMP  is important in many bacterial processes, including biofillm formation and motility.  The enzyme regulates signal transduction by controlling levels of the signalling molecule in cells.
We are using the enzyme to control the levels of cyclic-di-GMP within the cell.  We expect that the targeted expression of phosphodesiterase could be used to interfere with biofilm formation or to trigger dispersal.
Safety:
Phosphodiesterase enzymes are naturally present in many organisms, including E.coli. We are using it to disrupt biofilm formation by disrupting levels of cyclic-di-GMP, which is the natural function of the enzyme and has already been studied.  We do not anticipate the phosphodiesterase biobrick posing a safety risk.

Biobrick: LOV2
Host:
E.coli (Top 10)
Origin:
The LOV domain was originally isolated from Arabidopsis. It was characterised by Dr John Christie of the University of Glasgow.
The version of LOV2 we are using was codon optimised for expression in E.coli and synthesized by researchers from the University of Glasgow’s Institute Of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation.
Function & Uses:
The LOV (Light-Oxygen-Voltage) domain is a photoreceptor that responds to blue light.  In nature it was first found to be involved in the phototropism response in plants and has since been found to be present in fungi and bacteria also.  It has been shown to be coupled to many domains, for example phosphodiesterase or kinases.
We are using it in our cells as a reporter due to its ability to function in anoxic conditions.  This is particularly useful in biofilms and is a function that fluorescent proteins derived from GFP do not have.
Safety:
It has not been attached to any functional domain and the LOV domain itself has no pathogenic properties.  We therefore do not expect the LOV2 domain to have any safety risks.
It has previously been expressed in E.coli by Dr John Christie.

Biobrick: iLOV
Host:
E.coli (Top 10)
Origin:
iLOV is a version of LOV2 that has been altered through site directed mutagenesis and DNA shuffling.
Function & Use
iLOV has the same function and uses as LOV2. As a reporter, it is advantageous over GFP derived fluorescent proteins due to its small size (useful if you are tagging proteins), ability to recover quickly from photobleaching and use in anoxic conditions.
Safety:
The mutations that iLOV has the function of increasing intensity of fluorescence only.  It does not have any altered biological role or new biological function.
Therefore we do not antipate any way in which it could increase pathogenicity or survival in the wild.

Biobrick: Ranaspumin (RSN2)
Host:
E.coli (Top 10)
Origin:
Túngara Frog (Engystomops pustulosus)
Function & Uses:
Ranaspumin is a surfactant protein found in the foam nests of the Túngara frog.  In nature it is used to protect and incubate the fertilized eggs of the frog. It has natural antimicrobial functions and antibiofilm activity has been reported.
Safety:
We are using it to aid in dispersal of biofilms, which is a natural property of the protein.  It has no known biological risk to humans or the environment.

Biobrick: Ranaspumin with 6xHIS tag
We have also created a version of the Ranaspumin biobrick with a 6xHIS tag.
The HIS tag would not give the microorganism any enhanced ability to survive outside the lab, or pose a safety risk to the public or environment.

Biobrick: Latherin
Host: E.coli Top 10
Origin: Horse (Equus caballas)
Function & Uses:
Latherin is a surfactant protein that was originally isolated from horse sweat.  Its normal biological function is temperature regulation and is believed to function by enhancing evaporation from the pelt.  Due to its ability to bind to hydrophobic surfaces, the protein is being investigated for its possible ability to aid in breaking up biofilms.
Safety:
We are using latherin to aid in dispersal of biofilms, which is a natural property of the protein that has already been investigated.
Latherin is suspected to be involved in the allergen response to horses.  We propose that anything containing the protein should be clearly labelled as such, so that those with a horse allergy can avoid contact with it.

Biobrick: Latherin with 6xHIS tag
We have also created a version of the Latherin biobrick with 6xHIS tag for affinity purification.
The use of 6xHIS tags is well established and would not give the microorganism any enhanced ability to survive outside the lab, or pose a safety risk to the public or environment.

Nissle 1917 Strain of E.coli
Nissle 1917 is a strain of E.coli that we are working with due to its ability to form biofilms.  This is a capacity that laboratory strains of E.coli have lost.
It is used as a probiotic in health supplements, which are available to buy commercially in Germany as Mutaflor tablets. It is also studied as a carrier for therapeutic molecules, due to the fact it is safe for human consumption and does not cause illness when it colonises the gut.
