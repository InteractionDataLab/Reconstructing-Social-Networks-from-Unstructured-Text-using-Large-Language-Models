The iGEM Protocol Guide
When we were starting out in the lab, we spent so much of our time searching through the Registry trying to locate various protocols! We thought it would be really useful if some of the most commonly used protocols and information were all compiled into one place.
This is why we created the iGEM protocol guide. It contains all the protocols, from transformations to Minipreps, that we think future teams will need to get them started in the competition. We've also included some useful reference material on biobricks and some handy safety tips!
It is our intention that the guide will be made available to all teams competing next year, as we believe it will be a highly valuable resource for future iGEM teams.  We also hope that future teams will contribute any material to it that they think will be helpful, allowing for this booklet to become an excellent reference material for the competition.
