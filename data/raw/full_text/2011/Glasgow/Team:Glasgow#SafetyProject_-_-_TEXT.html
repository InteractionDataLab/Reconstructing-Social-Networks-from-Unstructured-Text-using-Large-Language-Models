Project Safety
Prior to starting work in the lab, all participants attended a three day training course to teach essential techniques, particularly how to work aseptically.  However, there were still many other safety issues that we needed to consider.
We began by getting a safety briefing for the equipment we would be using and the building we would be working in.  Each participating student was shown fire exits, the location of eye wash baths, the contents of the first aid box and also who the first aiders in our building are. We also read and signed all the relevant COSHH forms.
It was decided at an early stage of our project that we would work with biofilms. This meant examining a number of organisms which had properties of transforming readily and forming biofilms whilst still being safe to use. During investigative research we found that the lab-strain E. coli available to us (Top 10 and DS941), whilst being non-pathogenic, had selectively lost their capacity to form biofilms.
We also had access to three bacterial strains of the class Pseudomonas: (P. aeruginosa, P. putida and P. fluorescens). Whilst having a well documented capacity to form biofilms, P. aeruginosa is also classed as a level 2 biosafety organism. This means that the organism is associated with human disease and so precautions must be taken to prevent percutaneous, ingestion and mucous membrane exposure to clinical materials - as per BSL2 recommendations and OSHA requirements.
This meant that we had to carefully consider the safety of all researchers, as well as the public and environment before we began working with it.  All work with Pseudomonas was carried out under supervised conditions, in a part of the building that was not accessible to the public. All participants were also shown the proper way of handling these organisms and (on the advice of the building safety officer) we also made sure that all participants who normally would wear contact lenses did not. P.putida is less pathogenic and so we also worked with this where possible.
