Aims
-To find a suitable material for encapsulation
-To build a construct that will appropriately express this material within a biofilm
-To transform this construct into the chassis and express it
-To characterise the expression and its effects towards fixation and encapsulation of the biofilm
Methods
We found our encapsulating material in Capsular Colanic Acid (Chao & Zhang, 2011). For simplicity it was decided to use an existing colanic acid biobrick , from the Imperial College iGEM 2009 Team.
This biobrick system had been constructed to form a capsule of colanic acid that is anchored to the cell membrane by a ligase> E. coli naturally uses colanic acid to encapsulate itself (Stout & Gottesman, 1990), as shown in the image below.

The parts of the colanic acid system that were required to induce overexpression (Gervais, Phoenix & Drapeau, 1992) and export were selected. Anchoring to the membrane was not required. Top10 cells were transformed with the biobricks and the DNA was extracted to begin building a construct. We began attaching Ribosome Binding Sites and terminators to the biobricks we required, using the AlwNI-Method as detailed in our protocols. Due to time constraints we did not finish the entire construct.
