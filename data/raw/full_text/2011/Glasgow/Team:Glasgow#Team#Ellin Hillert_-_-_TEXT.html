I'm Ellin. I've just finished my second year of Biology at the University of Glasgow, and plan to go on to do an Integrated Master in Molecular and Cellular Biology. Contrary to popular belief I do NOT like cake. I do however like going to the gym. I am German, with a sense of humour! Also I am the only one in the team who can pronounce the word Eichhörnchen.
