Stirling castle.
I am undergraduate student at the University of Glasgow reading MCB. I joined the iGEM team to find out more about the exciting emerging field of synthetic biology. I actually live in a town in an area of Scotland called the Hillfoots near the historic city of Stirling, site of the famous battle of Bannockburn.
