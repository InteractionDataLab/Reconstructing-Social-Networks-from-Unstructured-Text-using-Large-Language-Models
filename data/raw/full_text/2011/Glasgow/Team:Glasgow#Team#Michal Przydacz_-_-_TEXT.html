Hi, I'm Michal. I came from Poland to study in Glasgow. I have a broad spectrum of interests: from snowboarding, through sailing to martial arts. Not forgetting about molecular biology, of course. I've just finished second year of Molecular and Cellular Biology at University of Glasgow. I'm very excited with our project and working as a part of iGEM Team. I have a feeling it's going to be a great summer!
