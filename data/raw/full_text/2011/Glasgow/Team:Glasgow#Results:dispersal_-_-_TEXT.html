Dispersal of the biofilm
Aims:
To perform PCR on the rsn-2(Ranaspumin-2)and lath(Latherin) inserts.
To perform site directed mutagenesis on lath, thereby removing illegal restriction sites.
To ligate the amended lath, as well as rsn-2 into a suitable plasmid  and transform it into competent cells.
To produce successful overnight liquid cultures, then miniprep them.
To produce successful overnight liquid cultures of lath, then miniprep them.
To devise a successful assay of the surfactant proteins.
To digest and ligate the inserts to plasmids with ribosome binding sites, the three light-dependent promoters, and double terminators present.
To characterise the latherin and ranaspumin constructs, by testing them in a biofilm setting.
To ligate the inserts into the submission vector and submit them to the registry.
Methods:
The DNA of  Latherin and Ranaspumin-2 we obtained was in plasmids. In both cases, there were two versions of the genes: one containing HIS tag and on without it. The coding sequences were excised from the plasmids and  the Standard BioBricks end were added through PCR. Additionally, Latherin contained three illegal restriction sites. Therefore, we had to perform Site Directed Mutagenesis (SDM) to eliminate them. Table 1 contains the primers we used to achieve that.

The two other protein we used for the biofilm dispersal, Colicin E2 (BBa_K131000) and T4 Endolysin (BBa_112806), were obtained from Registry.
An assay was devised for the surfactant proteins: A DNAse is used to lyse the cells containing the surfactant in liquid culture. The culture is then shaken and should produce considerably more bubbles than if the surfactants were not present.
The DNA of c-di-GMP specific Phosphodiesterase (PDE) was in the form of a plasmid. The coding sequences were excised from the plasmids and  the Standard BioBricks end were added through PCR. Additionally, it contained two illegal restriction sites. Therefore, we had to perform Site Directed Mutagenesis (SDM) to eliminate them. Table 2 contains the primers we used to achieve that.

To determine the rate of diffusion through a biofilm of each of the molecules and calculate the attainable spatial resolution, we used those following equations:
Equation 1
where:
P (r,t) – number of molecules at the certain distance after a certain time
A – total number of molecules in the system
r – distance from point of origin (mm)
D – diffusion coefficient
t – time (min)
Equation 2
where:
Pf (r,t) – Final number of molecules at given distance at given time
P (r,t) – initial number of molecules according to Equation 1
λ – rate of degradation (molecule/min)
t – time passed (min)
Results:
PCR of ranaspumin and latherin was successful.
Gel showing Ranaspumin-2 after PCR.
Gel showing both the His-tagged, and non His-tagged versions of Latherin after PCR.
Site Directed Mutagenesis was attempted several times for latherin, but was unsuccessful. There are  still illegal restriction sites in the insert. Transformation of latherin was therefore not possible.
Transformation of ranaspumin-2 was successful. Ranaspumin-2 was miniprepped.
An assay for the surfactants was devised but not tested, owing to time constraints (see Methods).
The results regarding the biofilm dispersal we acquired using our single-cell models and some additional values are shown in the table below. We also created models for Phosphodiesterase activity and the multi-cell models for Latherin and Colicin E2. For more information, please refer to Modelling site.
