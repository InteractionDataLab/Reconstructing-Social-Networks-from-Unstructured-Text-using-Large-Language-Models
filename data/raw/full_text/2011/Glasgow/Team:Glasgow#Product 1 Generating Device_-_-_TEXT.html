Product Three Generating Device Construct
Construct that is regulated by a blue light inducible promoter. Allows for selection of a any product which needs specific controlled expression either temporally or spatially. For proof of concept coloured carotinoids will be used, however in practice these products could be enzymes in a metabolic pathway that can be selectively induced to create different end products from the same precursor molecule.
Green Light Dependant Promoter
BBa_K225000
Red light dependant promoter developed by the 2004 UT Austin iGEM team.
Strong Ribosome Binding Site
BBa_B0030
Strong RBS based on Ron Weiss thesis. Strength is considered relative to BBa_B0031, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0033 and BBa_B0034
Beta-carotene
BBa_K274200
Biobrick designed by the 2009 Cambridge team. Converts FPP to beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is an orange coloured carotinoid.
Double Terminator
BBa_B1006
Artificial double terminator with 8bp stem and 6 nucleotide loop
