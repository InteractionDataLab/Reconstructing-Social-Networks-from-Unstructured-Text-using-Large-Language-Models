Want to know how life in the lab is going? Check out our weekly videos!
Week 1 Summary
This week the video is presented by Michal Przydacz. Click here to find out more about Michal!
 This week:
* Our new lab was set up
* We created glycerol stocks of E.coli and Pseudomonas strains for future use
* We had a meeting with Dr Daniel Walker who gave us some really useful information
* We chose the biobricks we would need (various Promoters, Ribosome Binding Sites and Terminators)and began transforming them
Week 2 Summary
This week the video is presented by Ellin Hillert. Click here to find out more about Ellin!
 
This week:
* We began the week with yet another transformation failure, resulting in our first successful transformants!
* Our secret strain of E.coli arrived!
* We each gave a presentation on different aspects of our project
Week 3 Summary
This week the video is presented by Andrew Landels. Click here to find out more about Andrew!
 
This week:
* We now have successful transformations of all our biobricks!
* Our secret strain of E.coli forms really nice biofilms!
* We had our very first Wiki Whaaaaaam!
Week 4 Summary
This week the video is presented by Pietro Ridone.  Click here to find out more about Pietro!
 
This week:
* Work to gather data on biofilm growth and dispersal continues.
* Primers for biobricks arrived
* The guys have given us a sneak preview of the Norwich presentation
* We have acquired our own Flouresence Microscope...
Week 5 Summary
This week the video is presented by Chris Wood. Click here to find out more about Chris!
 
This week:
* The guys have returned from Norwich with some great insights
* Everyone is excited to incorporate human practices into the project in a new way
* We now have a plan for Modelling
Week 6 Summary
This week the video is presented by Hannah Ralph. Click here to find out more about Hannah!
 
This week:
* We started ligating our constructs
* PCR was carried out on our novel biobricks
* Our secret E.coli strain was successfully transformed with RFP!
Week 7 Summary
This week the video is presented by Emma Campbell. Click here to find out more about Emma!
 
This week:
* Edinburgh sent us some biobricks to work with
* We realised our novel biobricks have illegal restriction sites, so ordered primers for Site Directed Mutagenesis
* Our poster for the Open Day is looking great!
* Amsterdam is booked - everyone is really excited!
Week 8 Summary
This week the video is presented by Stewart O'Neill. Click here to find out more about Stewart!
 
This week:
* Work on our light responsive constructs and Edinburgh biobricks is continuing
* An EnvZ negative strain of E.coli arrived from the Registry
* Modelling is going really well
Week 9 Summary
This week the video is presented by Scott Wood. Click here to find out more about Scott!
 
This week:
* PCR and Site Directed Mutagenesis is continuing on our novel biobricks
* Our work with the EnvZ negative cells is ongoing
* Modelling looks great - we now have some really great graphs for our dispersal biobricks!
