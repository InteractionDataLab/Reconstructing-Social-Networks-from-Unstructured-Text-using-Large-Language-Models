Aims
Back to Results
- To develop a more efficient method for testing large numbers of biobricks
Method
The restriction enzymes we chose to include in our Multiple Cloning Site are XhoI, BamHI, SalI, BglI and HindIII.
We designed primers and had the Multiple Cloning Site biobrick synthesized. These primers are below:
Forward Primer
5'-AATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGGGTACCGGCGCCCTCGAGGGTCCAGCTTTACTAGAAAAAAAAACCCCGCCCCTGACAGGGCGGGGTTTTT-3'
Reverse Primer
5'-GCGGCCGCTACTAGTAAAAAAAAACCCCGCCCTGTCAGGGGCGGGGTTTTTTTTTCTCTAGTAAAGCTTGGATCCCTCGAGGGCGCCGGTACC
CTCTAGAAGCGGCCGCG-3'
The part is still awaiting synthesis.
