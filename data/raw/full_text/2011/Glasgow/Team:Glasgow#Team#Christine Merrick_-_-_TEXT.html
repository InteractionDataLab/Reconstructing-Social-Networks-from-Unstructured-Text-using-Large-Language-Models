Hi, I'm Christine. I had my first taste of iGEM in 2007 when I was on the University of Glasgow team and helped design an environmental biosensor called ElectrEcoBlu. Now that I have started my PhD I am back for more. I'm looking forward to seeing the products of this year's team's fantastic DisColi project.
