Pattern Forming Device Construct
The pattern forming device essentially causes targeted dispersal of biofilm. To target the dispersal a light dependant promoter is used allowing bio-photo-lithography.
Blue Light Dependant Promoter
BBa_K238013
Weak blue light dependant promoter. Strength is considered reletive to I20260
Strong Ribosome Binding Site
BBa_B0030
Strong RBS based on Ron Weiss thesis. Strength is considered relative to BBa_B0031, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0033 and BBa_B0034
Colicin E2
BBa_K131009
The Colicin E2 operon without the SOS promoter. Colicin has DNAse activity.
