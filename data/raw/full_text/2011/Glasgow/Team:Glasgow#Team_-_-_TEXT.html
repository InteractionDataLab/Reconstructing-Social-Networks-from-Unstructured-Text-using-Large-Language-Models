Where we're from
We all study at the University of Glasgow in Scotland's largest city.
The University was founded in 1451, and apart from being generally amazing it is most notable for its gorgeous neo-gothic main building designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott. With its spire and quadrangles it is enough to make anyone feel like a student of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The University was based in Glasgow Cathedral until 1460. It then moved to Glasgow High Street, where it operated for the next 400 years. When the University outgrew its facilities there it relocated to Gillmorehill, to its new, specially built campus. The campus, where over 23,000 students attend, currently comprises of 104 buildings. The University library holds over 2.5 million books on 12 floors, making it one of the largest libraries in Europe.
Glasgow itself is a great city with a vibrant nightlife and a broad range of more cultural activities to choose from. Many museums are free for anyone and always worth a look. For Example, the Kelvingrove Museum offers a slightly random collection of natural history and art, and is also architecturally very interesting. Additionally it is a great place for anybody who would like to learn more about the history of Glasgow.
