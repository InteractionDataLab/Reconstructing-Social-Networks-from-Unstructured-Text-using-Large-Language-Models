Ranaspumin-2
Back to Parts
Ranaspumin-2 is one of six proteins used by the tungara frog (Engystomops pustulosus, found in Central and South America) to form protein foam nests in which it deposits its eggs. Protein foams are relatively rare in biology, and in this case offer a biocompatible solution to incubation and protection from mechanical destruction, as well as anti-microbial properties.

Structure
Coded for by the gene rsn-2, Ranaspumin-2 (Rsn2) is a monomeric surfactant protein, with an atomic mass of 11kDa. It has a molecular weight of 13415.2 and is comprised of 117 amino acids. In aqueous solution it adopts a tightly folded globular shape, which is uncharacteristic of surfactant proteins. In this 3D arrangement Rsn2 consists of a single helix over a four-stranded sheet, as can be seen in the image below.

This structure is highly unusual for a protein with surfactant properties, and appears to convey no significant amphiphilicity. It is therefore believed that Rsn2 undergoes a significant conformational change when at the air-water interface, in which it will expose hydrophobic groups to the air and hydrophilic groups to the water beneath. (Mackenzie, 2009)

Function
The protein undergoes a conformational refolding whilst in solution, exhibiting significant surfactant properties at the air-water interface. This property makes it potentially useful when working with biofilms that form at the same phase interface, as it is thought that it may assist in the destruction of the biofilm.
