Structure Fixing Device Construct
The structure fixing device induces the production of proteins that strengthen the light generated 3D structure of the biofilm. This allows the rest of the bacteria to be removed without disrupting the formed structure.
Blue Light Dependant Promoter
BBa_K238013
Weak blue light dependant promoter. Strength is considered relative to I20260
Strong Ribosome Binding Site
BBa_B0030
Strong RBS based on Ron Weiss thesis. Strength is considered relative to BBa_B0031, BBa_B0032, BBa_B0033 and BBa_B0034
Colanic Acid
BBa_K200000
Capsule forming biobrick developed by the 2009 Imperial iGEM team.
-OR-
Tropoelastin
Theoretical biobrick created by the 2009 Aberdeen iGEM team.
Double Terminator
BBa_B1006
Artificial double terminator with 8bp stem and 6 nucleotide loop
