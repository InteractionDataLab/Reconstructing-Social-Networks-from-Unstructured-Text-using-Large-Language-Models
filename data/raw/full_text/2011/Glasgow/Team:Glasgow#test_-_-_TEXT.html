System Design
The system we have designed for iGEM 2011 takes advantage of the modular nature of synthetic biology and combines relatively few parts to create a complex and highly regulated system of gene expression. This diagram shows how the biobricks we intend to create can be organised to allow for the bio-photo-lithography process.
Use the switch and the different colours of light to choose which device is active! Mousing over the highlighted devices will display the biobrick constructs we have designed to perform the device functions. Clicking the Pattern Formation, Product Selection or the Structure Fixation tab will highlight the devices used for the selected stage.
