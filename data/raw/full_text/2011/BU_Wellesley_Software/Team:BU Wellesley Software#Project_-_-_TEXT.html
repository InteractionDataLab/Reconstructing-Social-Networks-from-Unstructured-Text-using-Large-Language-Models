Team:BU Wellesley Software/Project
From 2011.igem.org
This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.

Project Description
Biological systems are composed of seemingly intractable sets of complex interactions.  Studying these interactions one at a time can be tedious and time consuming.  Our research introduces a recombinant method for studying these interactions more efficiently by designing custom “plasmid architectures” that allow the researcher to reconfigure different DNA parts within the plasmid.  Our specific design driver is the exploration of transcription factor interaction in tuberculosis.
While studying biology can be intractable, managing your lab should not.  Along with our custom plasmid architecture, we have developed a suite of software tools that not only automate the design process of these custom plasmids, but streamline the assembly of all DNA parts while keeping the members of the lab in sync via an electronic laboratory notebook.  By linking these tools to a central lab database, all of this information can be accessed from multiple devices and shared between lab members.  We hope that these tools will promote collaboration between labs and increase productivity within the synthetic biology community.
