Alex Pan's Notebook
HI!  I'M ALEX!
Over the summer, I had my eyes opened to Computer Science! I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I worked on Trumpet surface designs with Mikey and Michelle. Together we brainstormed how to translate Craig's desktop interface into an intuitive tabletop interface that takes advantage of the multitouch capabilities. We even considered integrating tangibles! I learned Photoshop to create design mock-ups and sat with Michelle and Mikey to create the entire interface myself!
I learned a great deal and am super excited to go to the regoinal jamboree!
