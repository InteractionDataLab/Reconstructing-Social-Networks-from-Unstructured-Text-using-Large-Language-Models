Mikey's Notebook
I recently graduated from Olin College with a degree in electrical and computer engineering. I'm excited to work with Wellesley and BU this summer before starting work at Google in September.

We started our final push before the usability study. By this point we had refactored our code using the model view view-model (MVVM) pattern and had a couple pieces of functionality left to add. I worked on speeding up the initial rendering of the chromosome bar. The chromosome bar may contain tens of thousands of gene objects. As a result, it was important to get the rendering of the individual gene objects as fast as possible. By analyzing different methods for rendering the genes, I was able to reduce the total rendering time from fifteen minutes to thirty seconds.
We also hooked up the backend data source. This step went off without a hitch. We had previously agreed upon an interface that the data store had to follow and we used a mocked version while waiting for development to finish. When Megan finished the backend, we swapped the mock version and the real version and the application worked!

The usability study was completed without the app crashing! After the study, the lab met to discuss changes to be made to the application in preparation for testing the application at BU. Most of the changes focused around consistency. All the sequence/publication/translation views needed to look the same. There were also a couple of performance issues. Some of the longer operations, such as running BLAST, were tying up the main UI thread. We ran these operations in a separate thread and showed some sort of loading message to the users.

I've been working on writing a C# API to the registry of standard parts. I've found a couple of candidates for RESTful APIs:
Registry API page http://partsregistry.org/Registry_API
Registry DAS system http://partsregistry.org/DAS_-_Distributed_Annotation_System
TU Delft Parts Registry Mirror http://igempartview.appspot.com/api.jsp
