Welcome!
Synthetic biology will require a multidisciplinary, collaborative design environment in order to engineer the complex biological systems of the future. Our team has created a collection of software tools which address specific technical synthetic biology challenges while simultaneously advancing the way in which users interact with computing environments. Our software workflow comprises "G-Nome Surfer Pro" for research, "Trumpet" and "Optimus Primer" for design, and "Puppetshow" and "eLabNotebook" for the construction of those designs. In addition, we incorporated wetlab experimentation into our project to apply these tools to create novel biological systems to investigate Tuberculosis. The combination of human computer interaction, bio-design automation, and experimental design makes our effort unique in the iGEM experience and closes the loop on the design-build-test methodology.
