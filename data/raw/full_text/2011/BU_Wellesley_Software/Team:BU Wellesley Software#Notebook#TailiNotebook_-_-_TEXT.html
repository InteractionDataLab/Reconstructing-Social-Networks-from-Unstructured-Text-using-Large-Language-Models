Week of June 3  (Bootcamp!)
Overview of iGEM Competition
Introductory crash course on Biology and Synthetic Biology
Summary on Tuberculosis
Connection between Synthetic Bio and CAD concepts (super cool)
Existing tools developed for Synthetic Bio
Digital Logic
Week of June 10 (Brainstorming via G-Nome Surfer )
Reconsider the application of G-nome Surfer towards Synthetic Bio
Provide support for prokaryotes (previously only focusing on eukaryotes)
New visualizations for displaying circular chromosomes
New visualizations for BLAST results
Improve existing PubMed access function on G-nome Surfer
Ability to support over 200 publication results
Debug HTTP request bug in code
Optimize method for pulling data via internet
Design new ways for visualizing large quantities of text-based data
Brainstorm Extended Desktop feature
co-existence of multiple layers in a way that does not hinder interaction
smooth animation for data transfer between layers
Expand existing code on feature implementation
Week of June 17 (Implementation of initial prototype)
Explored interactions of a wheel-like feature for navigating circular chromosome based on paper prototype
Construct functional prototype of chromosome wheel and base pair navigation using Surface SDK
Adopted interaction approach via custom user control and Affine2DManipulationProcessor events (versus the alternative of using ScatterViewItems and preexisting contact events)
Dynamically generated tick marks and labels on wheel according to base pair information
Overlay of actual gene visualization by porting GView into WPF environment
Continued brainstorming concepts for new publications (PubMed feature) interaction
Studied Geneious software's approach to handling publications
Pros and cons between PubMed and Google Scholar
Common methods for sorting and filtering publications during research
Week of June 24 (Prep for first demo)
Worked out GView adaptation into G-Nome Surfer
Created live access to GView through terminal access and .jar execution
Implemented publications feature on G-Nome Surfer
Shuffling interaction
Adopted cards-in-a-box metaphor for interaction
Added animations to Chromosome Wheel feature
Integration of Chromosome Wheel and publication feature with rest of project (zooming, search menu, individual gene exploration, sequences, ontology, back-end data management, etc)
Week of July 1 (Refined direction for competition)
Adapted implementation of new codes using data binding and unit testing techniques (WAY more organized code!)
Refractored publication feature code using new techniques
Implemented real-time result retrieval
Optimized HTML parsing code using HTML Agility Pack
Reduced lag time to less than 2 seconds for over 200 results
Week of July 8 (Adopting Model-View-ViewModel concept)
Restructured entire G-nome Surfer Pro application by using the Model-View-ViewModel concept
Separated all previously existing classes into Models, Views, ViewModels, and auxiliary classes
Merged all resource dictionaries into a common dictionary
Cleaned up and removed unnecessary code
Replaced all components of the application from various different controls into SurfaceUserControls
Re-wrote Publications feature using new MVVM concept
Applied articles-in-a-box metaphor to Publications feature
Implemented drag and drop interaction using the DragandDropFramework
Improved color scheme for Publications feature
Week of July 15 (Adding Extended Desktop feature)
To support better information organization and workflow efficiency, we designed an extended desktop feature, similar to a drawer/file cabinet metaphor
Implemented additional layer on G-nome Surfer Pro as extended desktop
Filtered horizontal touch manipulation for layer
Implemented object transferring between layer mechanism
Week of July 22 (Sequence templates, real data, error testing on system)
Created new style templates for Sequences and Translations
Text formatting, labels, color schemes
Enabled real data process for all features in application
Debugged and prepared system for first wave of usability studies
Week of July 29 (Usability Studies)
Modifications to system based on user input
Adopted white text on black background style to allow text be read in low light environments
Increased size of publication articles for easier manipulation
Fixed full abstract bug
Maintained system stability (no crashes during studies at all)
Week of August 5 (User Studies, sequence alignment)
Implemented real-time sequence snapping alignment and detachment
Brought G-nome Surfer Pro to Boston University's CIDAR lab for user studies
