WELCOME!
Being a part of iGEM was always a dream to me in my undergrad. Unfortunately, I never got an opportunity to be a part of it. When I got accepted by Boston University, PhD program in Biomedical Engineering, I dreamt of working with a team of undergrads for iGEM and therefore here I am!
I have 4 yr experience with molecular biology/synthetic biology. I like to play around with DNA and do some cool stuff out of it. I work with Prof.James Galagan and do synthetic biology to study genes involved in transcriptional regulatory network of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. When Prof.Densmore interviewed me for a mentoring position for the team, we came up with the application to study MTb genes using the proposed plasmid architecture.
As a mentor,my contributions to the team are:
1. Troubleshooting experiments in the beginning
2. Overview of Tuberculosis and genes involved in transcription factor regulatory network
3. Primer designing
Even though I didn't get to spend a lot of time with the team this summer, iGEM was a great platform to get a collaboration started with Doug. Looking forward to be a part of more iGEM's in the future and come up with many more interesting applications with this plasmid architucture
Go team!!!!
