Welcome to my wiki! I am a first-year PhD student at Tufts University studying Human-Computer Interaction. I recently graduated from Wellesley College in May 2010. My research interests focus on how next-generation interaction techniques can support research through enhanced brainstorming and group collaboration. Previous to this summer, I worked on a multi-touch genome browser, G-nome Surfer , and a teaching tool for phylogenetics, Phylo-Genie . This summer I'm back at Wellesley as the student mentor to students on the development and engineering of multi-touch and tangible interaction software and tools, lead by Dr. Orit Shaer of the Wellesley HCI laboratory and Dr. Douglas Densmore of the SynBio laboratory at Boston University . For daily updates on my work and lab events, find me on Twitter at megankstrait .

Bootcamp
05.31 - 06.03 : This is week 1 of our work towards the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition in synthetic biology. We have a lot of excitement, but a lack of experience. Thus the BU team leaders have put together a bio bootcamp to take everyone bio 101, software support, and outreach opportunities in three days.
Technology Tour
Tuesday, we welcomed our three newest members - Kelsey, Casey, and Kathy - to the HCI laboratory with a tour of the technology and tools.
New students and current iPhone programmers worked on "Hello World", Microsoft Surface style.
Kathy, our resident bio-enthusiast and expert, started a survey of state-of-the-art genomics tools and molecular infographics.
Bio Basics
Lead by wet lab leader, Traci Haddock we learned the basics to catch everyone up to speed on the terminology, experiments, and tools (both physical and digital) employed by synthetic biologists.
CAD, Clotho, and Community
Mices and Devices
06.06 - 06.10 : Week 2, we focused on developing the multi-touch interaction for a prokaryotic genome browser. Mikey , Kathy, and I brainstormed visualizations and types of touch interactions. Based on Kathy's research into conventional representations and Mikey's exploration of Circos , Schemaball , and several other circular visualization softwares, we came up with a pen and paper prototype . Our main constraints/advantages is developing for a touch-based computational device to explore biological devices of varying scale and properties.
G-nome Surfer Pro
06.13 - 06.17 :
Prokaryotic Parser
Publications and Plasmids
Sequence and Search
Birthday BLAST
06.20 - 06.24 : Already week 4, already mid mid 20's! My mentor and lab mates, new and old, surprised me with cake and gifts to celebrate the new week and my old age. The focus this week was to finish the adaption of G-nome Surfer to visualize prokaryotic data and to design Primer BLAST for the Surface. This included
Twitter
Twitter Bomb
Defined as spam tweeting one particular topic to the twittersphere. Especially when making it a trending topic.
Twitter Blast
Defined as having a blast on twitter.
Primers, Permutations, and Papers
06.27 - 07.01 : Monday the entire comp. team along with Traci collected at Wellesley for a day of brainstorming and demos.
Development and Analysis
