Craig LaBoda | Boston University '11
Craig graduated from Boston University last semester with a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering.  As a 2010 Lutchen Fellow at BU, Craig studied the use of DNA microarrays for microfluidic disease diagnosis, as well as the capturing and organization of DNA origami.  This fall he will enter Duke University’s Electrical Engineering PhD program where he will study DNA self-assembly in Professor Chris Dwyer’s Self-Assembled Systems Group.
Craig loves shredding guitar and watching terrible horror films.

Shannon Harrington | Suffolk University '15
Shannon Harrington is currently a freshman at Suffolk University. She discovered iGEM through her high school and, because of her love of science, decided to apply. Shannon performed her science fair project at Biogen Idec in Cambridge, MA her sophmore, junior, and senior year. The topics she studied included the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and neuronal differentiation. She plans to major in Biology with a concentration in Biotechnology and minor in Criminal Justice. She loves to travel and has a passion for cooking!
