Carsten Blom
I am a 23 year old Cell Factory student and fascinated by how life, and specifically microbial life, functions. Therefore I dedicate my time and effort to find out. After having expanded and improved my skills in management and sales, I have set my path toward science.
In my master Cell Factory I focus on how we could harness or cooperate with nature's ingenuity for the use in industry. Outside of my study I enjoy reading, running and making trips with my motorcycle.
Tania Chroumpi
I am twenty-four years old and I was born and raised in Alexandroupolis of Greece. I completed my bachelor studies on Biology, in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and at the moment I am doing the master of Life Science and Technology in TU Delft, following the track of Cell Factory. In between, I was working, doing my internship, for CEFAS in UK.
Beside my studies, I enjoy diving, horse riding, dancing and playing volleyball.

In my first year I was a member of the study trip committee of Study Association LIFE. I’m currently a member of the Symposium committee which organizes a symposium in the spring of 2012. Besides my study I like to skate and dance salsa. I also enjoy playing the guitar and going to concerts and festivals.
