in our project. We listed all the questions which rised during this meeting, at the end we made a more detailed plan for the labwork. Afterwards Janneke, Carsten, Esmee and Tania worked on the lab manuals. 
On wednesday we joined the kick off meeting &quot;Meeting of Minds&quot;, organised by the Ratthenau institute. Their intention was to introduce synthetic biology to politicians. Therefore, we had a meeting with the young representives of the different poltical parties of the Netherlands. During this meeting we had several presentation about synthetic biology, the ideas of the Ratthenau institute for the Meeting of Minds, explanation og iGEM for the politicians etc. It was a very nice meeting and I think it is a very interesting oppertunity for our team to do a part for Human Practice! I'm looking forward to the further progress for this part. Beside meeting the politicians, we also had a drink with the other Dutch iGEM teams again. I liked the enthausiasm very much!  
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_23">Week 23</SPAN></H3><P>This week I had a talk with Alessandro about setting deadline, was good! From now on I’ll be more strict on deadlines guys! Beside that we discussed also the modelling plan. On Tuesday till Thursday I worken in Zeeland, at my parents place…Since I have to baby sit the dog, I finished the planning and did research for modelling. Further I made a flow diagram for modelling and on Friday I had a meeting with Christian Picioreanu and Alessandro. Together we distinguished the several different modelling parts in the total idea. The total idea for modelling is very nice, but it’ll take lots of time and needs lots of more research. Enough to do for next week! 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_22">Week 22</SPAN></H3><P>This week I focused on making the general planning…I think it sometimes is rather difficult to plan everything, especially with everybody still having exams etc. Beside this Esmee and I discussed the collaboration with the science centre, what are the possibilities, what would we like to do? A lot is possible and we really like to collaborate with the science centre, also for human practice. Just before the weekend, Carsten and I made a plan for modelling, which we will discuss next week with our supervisor Alessandro, the king of modelling. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_21">Week 21</SPAN></H3><P>This week we gave a lecture to all the professors about our project to gain usefull input. I was only present on Monday, since from Tuesday till Saturday I was allowed to do the business course of Heineken.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_20">Week 20</SPAN></H3><P>This weekend was lots more busy then we thought. Everybody worked very hard for the OSLI sponsor application, put a lot of effort in it and just in time we were finished! I was very proud of the team, so on Monday we had a bubble wine to celebrate. For me this week was full with meetings with lots of people again. For example; Han de Winde, the head of the department of biotechnology, some professors, Hans Fraaije from University Leiden, Peter Post from TNO…I discussed a lot of different angles of incidence which all will contribute to our project! 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_19">Week 19</SPAN></H3><P>By doing a lot research, little meetings with experts (professors, companies, other universities etc) and a lot of discussions we finally decided the main parts of our project. A fundamental part, a optimization part and an application part. This was also chosen after we had a meeting with team about what we really expected during this project. It became clear that almost everybody expected something else from the project. Luckily there was a lot of overlap, and in the end we have a plan where everybody will satisfied and happy. 
On Friday the team had a meeting in Amsterdam with all the iGEM teams of Holland, initiated by team Amsterdam. Everybody gave a little presentations, updated each other and of course there were some beers involved.  Unfortunately I could not be there, but I think it was a very good initiative!
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_18">Week 18</SPAN></H3><P>After a short meeting with only the team, we decided what we’ll do. It was still a bit vague….We would like to do something with specific characteristics of mfp5. From now on we were thinking out of the box and find a real clear idea of our project.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_17">Week 17</SPAN></H3><P>This week we converged the ten ideas into three main ideas. We gave on Friday a presentation for the advisors, supervisors and some experts-guests from companies.  After the presentation we decided to take into account the advice of all the advisors and decide after the weekend which real topic we’ll do. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_16">Week 16</SPAN></H3><P>The focus this week was mainly brainstorming. We had 150 ideas, and we wanted to converge these ideas to maximal 10 ideas.
