Production
The basis of our project is the production of Mfp-5 itself. For this, we use a BioBrick made by the iGEM team of Berkeley Wetlab 2009 (BBa_K197034). They attached  Mfp-5 to various membrane proteins  with varying linkers in order to research the influence of these linkers on the activity and to find the best combination for optimization. For our project, we chose the combination with the highest activity:  Mfp-5 linked to OmpA (Outer membrane protein A) with the linker GFP-LVA
