Week 22
During the past week I continued my work on the wiki. In addition we worked on a Dream Team Presentation. Afterwards we had a team dinner and some drinks afterwards. The following day I continued calling companies.
Week 21
This week I worked on improving the layout of the wiki. Furthermore I contact various companies about sponsoring possibilities. Last of all I had to do the obligatory handwash test which is necessary if one wants to do any labwork.
