About Us
The 2011 TU Delft iGEM team is made up of five students that will work throughout the summer in the Enzymology Lab of the Kluyver Laboratory at the Technical University of Delft. With three years of experience in iGEM and after last years' gold medal and awards the TU Delft team is highly motivated to deliver an even better project.
 
 
Our Goal
Our goal is to deliver a finished and coherent project at the European-African Jamboree in Amsterdam. Along the way we will learn, teach, discuss, have fun and make friends. This is what we will all take home as individuals. As a team we will try to take home an invitation for the MIT Jamboree!
