Localization
As an example of combining adhesiveness with other properties, we decided to localize the Mfp-5 to one side of the cell. This combination can be used for the fixating of bacteria in one direction and their flagella in an other, specific direction. When all bacteria are attached in the same direction, and all flagellae are orientated in the other direction, this will produce a particular flow pattern on nano-scale. One could create in this way a so called bio-motor. In a more fundamental point of view one can use head-to-head binding of bacteria for creating a line or circle of bacteria. The iGEM team of SDU-Denmark 2010 has produced a phototaxis system.One of the proteins they used was a transmembrane transporter  clustered to one specific side of the cell. Denmark achieved this by the use of specific directed proteins, which are involved by the formation of the flagellae, attached to their construct is sensory rhodopsin. Replacing this rhodopsin with our construct, or attaching our Mfp5-GFP to the sensory rhodopsin, enables localization of Mfp5.
