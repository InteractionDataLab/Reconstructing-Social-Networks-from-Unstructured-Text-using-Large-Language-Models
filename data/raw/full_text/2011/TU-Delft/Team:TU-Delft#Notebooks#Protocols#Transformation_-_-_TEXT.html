Transformation
Standard transformation procedure
1. Remove competent cells from -80, let thaw for 10 min on ice and aliquot in 50 ul amounts.
2. add 2-5 ul of vector, usually in H2O, to 50 ul cells, no mixing by pipet due to shear induction.
3. keep on ice for 20 minutes (vector spreading through volume)
4. heat shock (42°C) for 45 seconds
5. keep on ice for 2 minutes
6. add 200 ul SOC, put on 37°C for 1 hour or longer with agitation.
