I was looking forward for that one year now…. Greece I am coming…

We wanted to have a final answer and solutions in our localization questions. Finally, we decided to use parts of Denmark 2010 iGEM team, where transmembrane proteins were used (large clusters at the cell poles). The end of the week was mainly for study of the activation of mfp-5. Questions for the existence of tyrosinase in the periplasm and its degradation but also about the normal way of tyrosinase secretion from mussels were my priority.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_21">Week 21</SPAN></H3><P>This week started with a long presentation of our ideas and questions in front of the professors of the Biotechnology Department. It was a very good opportunity for their scientific input in our project. From that moment we focused in literature study about the genes that we are planning to use for our more advanced biobricks, the constructs that have to do with the localization of our protein in the membrane. The question was: Flagella machinery or chemoreceptors???
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_20">Week 20</SPAN></H3><P>Funding letters...
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_19">Week 19</SPAN></H3><P>We spent all weekend working on the research proposal for OSLI. It was a long and stressful weekend but and the end we did it! It was very nice to see all of us working for the same goal. This week we, as the new iGEM team, had a first meeting with Han de Winde, the head of the department of biotechnology.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_18">Week 18</SPAN></H3><P>With the team we decide to concentrate our research in one of all the Mussel foot proteins: the Mussel foot protein 5 (Mfp-5). Esmee and I did a deeper research about the properties of Mfp-5. At the end of the week we had already concluded in our final idea and its subprojects: cell-cell adhesion, cell-surface adhesion, and the regulation of the adhesive properties of Mfp-5. On Friday afternoon the team had a meeting with the other three Dutch iGEM teams in Amsterdam.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_17">Week 17</SPAN></H3><P>After a weekend that we had enough time to relax and think all our possibilities, we conclude in the topic of our iGEM project. In the beginning the idea was to combine both topics. Finally, the adhesive Mussel foot protein (Mfp) &quot;stuck&quot; in our minds... From Wednesday we started the literature research about our topic and its prospects. On Friday we gave a detailed presentation for our ideas in the Department of Biotechnology. In between, we had relaxing time going for a boat trip with all the members of the team, followed at the end of the week from some drinks in Beestenmarkt.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_16">Week 16</SPAN></H3><P>This was a week full of brainstorming meetings...On Monday we had a meeting with our supervisors and advisors. We finally reached around 150 topics. Our goal until the expire of the week was to come as closer as possible to our goal: our final topic!!! On Thursday we decide to continue with the four most prevalent topics. Esmee and I were responsible for the topic: Adhessive Mussel foot protein. On Friday we gave a presentation for each one of these topics in front of advisors, supervisors and some guests. We finally end the week with the two best ideas for us!
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_15">Week 15</SPAN></H3><P>Lesley Robertson, the Biological Safety Officer of the Faculty of Applied Sciences met us in her office. She explained us about the safety issues and the regulations that we have to follow while working in the lab. At the end of the week we had our second brainstorming session. All of us were very creative and we came up with many new ideas for topics.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_14">Week 14</SPAN></H3><P>&quot;Our first Brainstorming session&quot;. We came up with a lot of interesting ideas. It was a very productive day! Our goal for the next meetings is to have as many topics as possible.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_13">Week 13</SPAN></H3><P>This week a presentation from two members of the last year's iGEM team of TU Delft (Nadine and Eva) was in our schedule. They gave us a short introduction about Synthetic Biology, their way of working last year, their advices, but also about our responsibilities while working for iGEM. Amsterdam’s iGEM team was there as well! We had the opportunity to meet them and to have our first talk about our progress and our future plans. The advices of the supervisors from both teams were very inspiring and useful in planning our first steps…
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_12">Week 12</SPAN></H3><P>Exams...Stress...but at the end success!!!
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week_11">Week 11</SPAN></H3><P>At the end of this week, our first meeting with the team took place in the iGEM room! We finally met with the rest of the members of the new iGEM team of TU Delft. We had the opportunity to introduce ourselves, to express our interests and the reasons that led each one of us to join the team of this year. Nice experience... At the end we decided to have our next meeting one to two weeks later, due to the exam period, in order fun to start!!!
