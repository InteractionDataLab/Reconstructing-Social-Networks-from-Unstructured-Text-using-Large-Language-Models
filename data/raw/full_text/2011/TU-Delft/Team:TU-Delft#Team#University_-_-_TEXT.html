TU Delft: A modern university with a rich tradition
In Greek mythology Prometheus, whose torch forms the TU Delft logo, was a titan who defied Zeus, the supreme god, to steal fire from Olympus and give it to mankind. It was an act that marked the beginning of man’s technological development.
In the spirit of Prometheus, TU Delft is an entrepreneurial university at the forefront of technological development. As such it is perpetually involved in furthering technological advancement in the interests of society. By means of its fundamental and applied research and educational programmes, TU Delft trains the engineers of tomorrow.
Established on 8th January 1842 by King Willem II, TU Delft has a rich tradition reaching back more than 160 years. Initially the university focused predominantly on civil engineering but gradually more and more engineering disciplines have appeared on the academic programme. Today TU Delft has eight faculties and it currently offers fifteen BSc and twenty-nine MSc programmes. With approximately 13,000 students and an academic staff of 2,100 (including 200 professors), TU Delft is the largest and most comprehensive university of engineering sciences in the Netherlands.

Excellent research and education standards
TU Delft is a state university which conducts cutting edge research and provides first class education. In addition to national accreditation, many of TU Delft's educational programmes have also been acknowledged by international organisations such as the American Board of Engineering & Technology (ABET).
TU Delft's research portfolio is clustered around thirteen interdisciplinary technological themes examples of which are Computational Science and Engineering, Mechatronics and Microsystems, Nanotechnology, Sustainable Industrial Processes and Water: Water Works, Water Management and Water Quality. Research is conducted within the faculties, research institutes and research schools. Each year, the University's cumulative research results in an average of 185 PhD dissertations, and over 4,000 publications in scientific journals. Research and education are interrelated. This is most notable in the MSc programmes which are research driven and challenge students to make their own contributions.
Life Science & Technology
Most participants of the TU Delft iGEM team follow the Life Science & Technology bachelor at TU Delft or Leiden University. This programme aims to equips us with knowledge and expertise on the fundamental level and to familiarise you with the technologies inherent to practical applications of that knowledge. The subsequent master programs at the TU Delft are Biocatalysis, Cell Factory and Biochemical Engineering. As a graduate of the programme, we are well prepared for a career in either an industrial or an academic environment.

Molecular Science & Technology
The TU Delft and Leiden University also provide a study Molecular Science & Technology, which is being followed by one of our team members. This bachelor study focusses on organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry and process optimization. The frequently chosen master programs at TU Delft are Process Engineering, Biochemical Engineering and Control Engineering.

Enzymology
The TU Delft iGEM Team is very happy and proud to be a guest at the Enzymology Department. This group carries out fundamental and applied research in the field of enzymology: the bio-chemistry, biophysics and molecular biology of enzymes in living cells and as purified chemical compounds.
Emphasis is on the bioconversions by redox enzymes, in particular metalloenzymes, from extremophilic organisms, i.e. with a putative, intrinsic added value of stability under typical operational conditions for practical applications. A general Leitmotiv is the study of physiologically related proteins (e.g., metallo-enzymes, metal transport, metal insertion) as elements of a sub-network of the cell machinery with the objective to gather an understanding of integrated biological functioning.
