Our Brainstorming Sessions
In order to find the best idea for our iGEM project consecutive brainstorming meetings took place from April until early May. Our main goal was a topic that could give to all the members of our team the satisfaction and energy to be productive and enthusiastic working for iGEM during all summer!
We divided all the potentially topics in seven basic categories which are listed below:
• Food & Energy
• Environment
• Information Processing
• Health & Medication
• Foundational Advance
• Manufacturing
• New applications
List of our Ideas
In this point we would like to share some of our ideas which maybe will inspire future iGEM teams! Maybe some ideas seem to be “crazy” but there are no limits in imagination and creativity…Right?
