Welcome to the TUDelft iGEM website
Our team of seven students from the TU Delft is taking the challenge to compete in iGEM – the international genetics engineered machines competition. This competition channels student’s creativity and scientific skills towards the design and construction of a micro-organism with traits useful to society. TU Delft is successfully participating since 2008, thanks to the great contribution from companies and funds supporting these students. This year we are looking to you for support in our endeavor to develop and build an excellent biological machine.
In a competition against 150 teams from across the world the team of TU Delft will be representing the Netherlands’ strength in Synthetic Biology. In the coming summer our team of Masters and Bachelors students in chemical and life sciences will combine their skills and knowledge with the advice of several TU Delft professors to show that the Netherlands is still on the forefront of Life Sciences.
