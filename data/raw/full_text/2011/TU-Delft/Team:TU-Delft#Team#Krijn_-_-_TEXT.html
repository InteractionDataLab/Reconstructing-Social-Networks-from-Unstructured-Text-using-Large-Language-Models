Week 24
This week was a wiki week. I am a noob in HTML, but I am starting to understand it. It is really cool. Furthermore we try to set up a collaboration with Lyon and Michigan to discuss to
Week 23
This week more funding applications went out for the TU Delft project. I hope to get some positive answers soon and round up the funding part. The lab is calling out for occupation. It was a long and exhausting week for me so i'm very happy the weekend is ahead of me.
Week 22
This week I focused on the funding. Mondag and Thuesday I worked on the funding application of the StuD Fund. It is now finished and send out for evaluation. Wednesday I  had again a meeting with Simon Goede. Thursday and Friday I worked on the sponsor application of the University Fund Delft.
Week 21
This week we gave a lecture to all the professors about our project to gain usefull input. I worked whole week on the sponsoring brochure in Indesign, but it is a lot more complicated then I thought. A friend of mine, industrial design student Stefan Heijboer, made the final logo on thursday evening.
Week 20
Sunday we finished the OSLI sponsor application with a lot of effort from the whole team! Thursday we had a meeting with Han de Winde, head of department of Biotechnology. It was a brief get-to-know meeting. I also had a meeting with Elly Muilman, head of finance of Biotechnology. She explained me how fund raising works and she had very useful input. Wednesday I sad down with a friend to make a quick draft for the logo.
Week 19
This week was a lot of general brainstorming on the project topic and doing research on the feasibility of the idea. Wednesday I had my first meeting with Simon Goede, board member of Biotechnology. We talked about what we expected from each other. A good fundament for a long term collaboration. Friday we had a meeting with all Dutch teams (Gronigen, Wageningen and Amsterdam) in Amsterdam for an update on what everybody was doing, a topic presentation and exchanging valuable information.
Week 18
Sunday I returned from a ten-day trip to the UK. When I entered the iGEM room on Monday I was a bit disappointed that there was still no real topic choice. We wanted to do something with Mfp-5, but we still didn't know exactly what. A week of brainstorming and research followed.
Week 17
I spent the whole week in the UK. I walked past Imperial College for a meeting with their iGEM team, but unfortunately the building was closed because of Bank Holidays. Later that week I had a tour at Cambrigde University and I totally forgot to ask about their iGEM team. Shame on me!
Week 16
This week was filled with brainstorm sessions and discussions. The goal was to make a top 10 out of the 150 ideas we generated during the brainstorm sessions. Thursday morning I left for the UK.
