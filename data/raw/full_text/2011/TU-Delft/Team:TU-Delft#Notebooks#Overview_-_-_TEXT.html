Overview
In this point we would like to share with you how our iGEM experience was in time! We want to let everyone know what we are doing during all these months, what our goal is and how we are going to do it. So, in our notebook you can have a look not only to our weekly blog of all the team members, where we describe our progress throughout this period, but also our cloning plan and all the protocols that we used, working in the lab, in order to achieve our goals. Finally, we would like to give you an idea about our brainstorming sessions and our ideas, which may be very useful for future “iGEM inspiration”…
