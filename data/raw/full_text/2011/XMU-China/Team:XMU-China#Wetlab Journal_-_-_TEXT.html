Week 1(3rd Apr.—9th Apr.)
Aim:
By replacing the promoter of the existing BioBrick BBa_F2621 with Placo-1, the expression of the downstream sequence can be controlled by adding IPTG.
Performance:
Constructing the new BioBrick BBa_K658000 (The figure below and sequence analysis can indicate it is correctly constructed.)
Testing the expression of BBa_K658000 by adding IPTG  (We thought the part didn’t exist in the registry and we had constructed a new part. But, afterwards, we found it(BBa_F2622) did exist! )
