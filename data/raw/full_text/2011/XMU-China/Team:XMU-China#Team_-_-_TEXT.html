Acknowlegement
All work described on this wiki or on our Partsregistry pages was done by iGEM Team XMU-China 2011. We managed the whole project, from planing to financing and the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Therefore, special thanks to the following people:
Our Instructor Pro. Baishan Fang for giving us the opportunity to participate in iGEM through letting us work in his lab. We were allowed to use all instruments and materials of the lab. Furthermore, Pro. Fang helped us with scientific guidance, financing and was always ready for answering questions.
Our Wiki Constructor Yongzhen Hou from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications for helping us build up our website.
Our Advisor Dr. Jingcong Yu for giving us valuable ideas and guidance in lab practise.
Our Advisor Graduate Jianghai Peng for helping us in part designs.
