This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this is the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)

Answers to four key safety questions:
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:  a. researcher safety,  b. public safety, or  c. environmental safety?
No.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,  a. did you document these issues in the Registry?  b. how did you manage to handle the safety issue?  c. How could other teams learn from your experience?
No.
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?  a. If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?  b. If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
No. We carry out our experiments and evaluate the biostefy issues in our project strictly according to the "Chinese Pathogenic Microbiology Laboratory Bio-safety Regulations" which is released on November,12th,2004.
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
As IGEM teams are from different countries which may have different regulations for biosaftey. So we recommend that the IGEM organization collect information and make standard biosafety rules for basic synthetic biology experiments in this competition which all the teams could obey.
