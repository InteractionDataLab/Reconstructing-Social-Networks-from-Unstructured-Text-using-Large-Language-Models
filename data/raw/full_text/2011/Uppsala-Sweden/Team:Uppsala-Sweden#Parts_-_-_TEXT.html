Furthermore, Uppsala-Sweden has submitted 4 intermediate constructs that do not have any obvious function by themselves. However, these constructs contain sequence information that could be valuable to assess the quality of the complete constructs. These constructs are <partinfo>BBa_S04614</partinfo> to <partinfo>BBa_S04617</partinfo>.
Our favorite parts are:
<partinfo>BBa_K592009</partinfo> the amilCP blue chromoprotein, displaying strong color and extremely useful as reporter;
<partinfo>BBa_K592100</partinfo> the Blue Fluorescent Protein (mTagBFP), with its excitation peak at 399 nm and emission peak at 456 nm, a reporter well suited for e.g. flow cytometers with violet laser (e.g. FACSAria II) and DAPI filter (band pass 450/40);
<partinfo>BBa_K592200</partinfo> the "Low to medium copy BioBrick standard vector", specially designed to be useful for Lambda Red recombineering in E.coli, and contains spectinomycin antibiotic resistance marker.
