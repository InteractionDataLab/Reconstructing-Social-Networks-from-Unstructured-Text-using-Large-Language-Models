The Team
Supervisors
Anthony Forster
Dr. Forster received from the University of Adelaide, Australia, a B.Sc. majoring in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1983, a B.Sc. Hons. in Biochemistry in 1984, and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1988. He was a post-doctoral fellow with Nobel laureate Sidney Altman at Yale and received an M.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1996. He then completed a residency in Anatomical Pathology followed by research as an Instructor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School.
He was Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, from 2005-2011 before moving to Uppsala University, Sweden, as a Professor. Dr. Forster discovered the hammerhead catalytic RNA structure, invented photobiotin for the preparation of nucleic acid diagnostics and external guide sequences for ribonuclease P, and has created unnatural genetic codes de novo. He has published in journals including Cell, JACS, Nature, PNAS and Science, edited a volume of Methods, and has authored patents. His technology has founded 3 biotech companies. He currently researches synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery.
Anders Virtanen
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. In his research, experimental systems based on mammalian and Drosophila cells are employed. A main goal is to understand how mRNA turnover/degradation, through the mRNA specific cap and poly(A) tail, is integrated with other essential mechanisms of gene expression/regulation. Another goal is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions. These studies will be of importance for the general understanding of mechanisms controlling the fate of eukaryotic mRNA.
The two greatest discoveries made by Anders Virtanen are: the first known mRNA polyA-site in a human virus; and the enzyme in the animal cells that removes polyA-tail from mRNA.
