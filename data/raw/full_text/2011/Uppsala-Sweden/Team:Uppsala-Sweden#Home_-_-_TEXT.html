About our project
The  a bacterial system that will act like a bacterial photocopier and with this project we participate in the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM). Besides this, we will also put a lot of efforts into other parts of the project including software tool development, marketing, human practice biosecurity & bio-ethics and website.
The aim of the laboratory part of this project is to further develop the light induced regulation of gene expression. We will start out by repeating the multichromatic experiments by Voigt et al. 2011 with minor modifications. The first step is to request and construct the DNA for at least three light-sensing systems, each with different activation wavelengths. Then we test each light-sensing system individually in a bacteria platform. It means we test red, green and blue light sensing separately. Once this is done, we express the three light-sensing systems in the same platform, at the same time, and test their ability put together. The primary result from this should be enough to secure at least a place at the finals. If time permits, location-specific, directed mutagenesis on the light-sensing proteins should also be carried out. However, the ultimate goal remains to make the bacteria culture on agar plate “paint” a picture and thereby act like a photocopier
