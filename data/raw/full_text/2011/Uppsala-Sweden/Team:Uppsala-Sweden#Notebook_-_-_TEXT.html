Notebook
Week 1
This week was dedicated to make buffers such as CCMB80 and SOC, SOB and LB medium (See the protocols SOB-medium , LB medium and competent cell preparation ). We also prepared selective agar plates with ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin (See agarplate preparation). Finally we prepared competent TOP10 cells and froze them in -80°C. We received the pTJ122 plasmid carrying the ccaS, ccaR and cph8 genes as well as the PcpcG2 promoter from Christopher A Voigt at University of California San Francisco.
Week 2
2011-06-27
This week we started with testing the competence in our cells. For this transformation we used one positive control (plasmid pUC19 from New England Biolabs) as well as a negative control without plasmid. For the procedure we followed the protocol for transforming TOP10 competent cells . The result was good, we measured a competence efficiency of 1.7 * 10^8 transformants /ug DNA.
Blue / green output
The strains carrying the amilGFP (green/yellow output) and amilCP (blue output) plasmids were provided by J.F Miller, UCLA. They arrived on plates witch were malhandled during the delivery. Both colors looked really nice but since the colonies were all mixed into each other we started by re-plating to obtain single colonies.
2011-06-28
Blue / green output
Started overnight cultures of E coli carrying the plasmids pGEM11-amilGFP and pGEM14-amilCP.  We followed the protocol for overnight culture and glycerol stock for the initial preparations on the output modules.

Streaked on plate
pSB3T5-J04450 (low copy vector tet, ori P15A) – From Erik G
Evaluation: All samples were good. pSB1K3 plates with RFP inserts are less red than pSB1A3 and pSB1C3. Re-streaking of the successful transformations from 2011-07-28. The same people who did the transformation proceeded with re-streaking.  Cph8 had no colonies at all, neither on the 1x or 10X dilution plate. Apparently there seems to be a problem with cph8. Thus, cph8 (red sensor) had to be redone due to failure in the first attempt.
2011-06-30
Re-streaking of the transformants from 11-06-29 and started overnight cultures from the re-streaked plates from the previous day (11-06-28).
Evaluation: Most transformations succeeded. However, cI inverter gave very little amount of colonies and cph8 failed again. It’s time to use another approach. We got one single colony on the transformation plates and we will screen that one, but if that colony is wrong will try to run a PCR using the standard VF2 and VR primers using the DNA in the kit as template. If there is any BioBrick plasmid in that well, we should get a PCR product. If this will not work out, we need to either synthesize the gene or to PCR up the gene from the Voigt plasmid pJT122. We will then need to clone it into a BioBrick plasmid and run site-directed mutagenesis on it to eliminate the illegal PstI restriction site. Since cph8 is an important part of our project we have to solve this dilemma.
2011-07-01
Started by doing overnight cultures from the re-streaked plates from 11-06-30.  After that Lei and Sibel sterile filtered 20 % glycerol for making glycerol stocks. All the overnight cultures prepared 11-06-30 were frozen in -80°C.
2011-07-02
All the overnight cultures prepared 11-07-01 were mixed with glycerol and frozen in -80°C. At this stage content with the work done this far.
Week 3
2011-07-04
Started by doing overnight cultures (3 ml in selective LB) of the strains carrying these plasmids: pSB1A3-J04450 (vector, ampR)
pSB1C3-J04450 (vector, CmR)
pSB1K3-J04450 (vector, KanR)
pSB1A2-B0034 (Standard RBS)
pSB2K3-I15008 (ho1, chromophore synthesis gene)
pSB2K3-I15009 (pcyA, chomophore synthesis gene)
pSB2K3-Q03530 (cII inverter)
pSB1AK3-B0015 (Double terminator)
pSB2K3-Q01511 (cI inverter)
pSB1A2-R0082 (PompC)
The purpose was to make plasmid preparation the day after.
2011-07-05
Green sensor
The day started off by running BioBrick overhang PCR on the DNA template of the green light sensor, which includes the two genes ccaR, ccaS and the PcpcG2 promotor (see protocol ccaR BioBrick, protocol ccaS BioBrick & protocol PcpcG2 BioBrick). Voigt(UCSF) provided the green sensor, the red sensor and PcpcG2 on plasmid pJT122 (11,088 bp) [ Tabor et al 2011 ].
Green&Blue output
Site-specific mutagenesis was performed on amilGFP and amilCP in order to remove illegal EcoRI sites within the genes (protocol amilGFP_EcoRI, protocol amilCP_EcoRI).
After lunch we did a plasmid preparation of the overnight cultures from 2011-07-04.
Red sensor
At the end of the day we performed colony PCR to verify the length of the single clone we got of red light sensor (cph8) strain.
2011-07-06
Preparation of agarose gel (1%) for the gel electrophoresis. Then we ran our PCR products from 11-07-05 on the gel.
Finally we initiated the first BioBrick assembly. The following entities were assembled:
Chromophore
RBS (B0034) + pcyA (I15009) - Lidaw, Pikkei & Johanna
RBS (B0034) +ho1 (I15008 ) - Erik L & Tomas
Red output
PompC (R0082) + Inv.cl (Q01511) – Kalle, Hamid, Ismael
The plasmids were cut, the enzymes heat inactivated. After mixing the upstream parts, the downstream parts and the backbones, T4 ligase was added and the ligation mixes were left over night in room temperature.
Evalutation: We couldn’t observe any band on the gel corresponding to cph8. Thus the transformation of cph8 has failed completely. We came up with the following conclusions: either there were no or little DNA in the iGEM kit, or the kit just contained something else.
All the other gels were successful but the band for pcpcG2 was slightly weak. The gel bands for ccaR and ccaS looked good. Hence, we have successfully PCR amplified the green sensor parts. Also, the PCR products from the site directed mutagenesis of amilCP_EcoRI and amilGFP_EcoRI showed strong and clear bands at the expected size. Furthermore we can now proceed on cloning ccaR, ccaS and the PcpcG2.
2011-07-07
Re-circularized of pigment vectors after site directed mutagenesis by Sibel. The PCR product was purified, phosphorylated with PNK, template plasmid was degraded using DpnI and finally the linear plasmid was re-circularized using T4 ligase (PCR purification protocol, Phosphorylation of DNA, DpnI digestion protocol).
Tomas and Antonio performed transformation of assembly RBS-ho1 (Protocol for transforming TOP10 competent cells). Transformation of mutagenized amilCP_EcoRI and amilGFP_EcoRI by Hamid and Lei.
Digestion of ccaS and ccaR PCR products and plasmid backbone plasmid pSB1C3 by Tomas and Antonio followed up by cloning and transformation by Erik L (BioBrick Assembly Manual). Lidaw And Johanna transformed the RBS-PcyA assembly.
2011-07-08
The transformation from yesterday was successful; hence the same people could proceed with restreaking the transformants. Hamid and Tomas re-did PCR on pcpcG2 using primers with BioBrick overhangs because of the weak band we got last time. This time we got a stronger band.
λ Red
After internal discussions concerning progresses this far, we decided to start preparing the λ Red assembly parallel with the other assemblies. We need to knock out the gene envZ in our E coli strain to avoid cross-talk with our red sensor cph8. To do this, we will use Lambda Red recombineering [ Datsenko and Wanner, 2000 ].
First step was to perform colony PCR of a strain carrying the plasmid pKD4 (Datsenko) to generate a PCR fragment with a kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites and homologies to envZ: “EnvZ- Knock out FRT-Kan” (PCR protocol of envZ knockout FRT-Kan_FRT). We could observe the bands around 1477 bp as we expected. However, we also got a stronger band for the negative control (NC). Even though it seems like we got the right product, the appearance of a band in the NC force us to redo the experiment. Just as a precautious measure.
2011-07-10
Today we screened the transformants from 11-07-08
3A assemblies:
RBS-pcyA,
RBS-ho1
PompC-Inv.cl,
Clonings:
ccaS and ccaR.
Mutagenesis:
amilCP and amilGFP.
There were 6 clones of each transformants, 42 samples in total.
We selected and suspended one colony from each re-streaked clone in 20-30 µl of PBS. We ran colony PCR from of each suspended colony using taq polymerase using the VF2 and VR primers. We also started overnight cultures in selective medium from the suspensions, 1 ml in each.
As a final attempt to get the cph8 gene from the iGEM kit, we tried running a PCR using the VF2 and VR primers and DNA from the kit as template. To be able to get high quality on the PCR product, we used Phusion DNA polymerase.
Last thing was to run an agarose gel of the PCR products. We also ran the PCR product of the envZ Knockout cassette and cph8 on agarose gel. The envZ Knockout had a clear band (we lowered the annealing temperature from  60°C to 59°C). Last thing we did was doing PCR purification of envZ Knockout (Purification protocol). The cph8 showed no bands on the gel, indicating that there simply is no BioBrick plasmid DNA in the kit well.
Week 4
2011-07-11
Today we did a frozen stock of all overnight cultures in -80°C freezer (ccaS clone 1,RBS-pcyA, amilGFP, amilCP, ccaR, RBS-ho1, PompC-Inv.cI). We also started 3 ml cultures by inoculating them with 100 µl of the overnight cultures of the two clones of  ccaR, RBS-pcyA and RBS-ho1, the constructs needed for the upcoming assemblies. When the cultures had grown for about 4 hours, we did plasmid preparations of them. We did PCR of amilCP using the pGEM14-amilCP_EcoRI plasmid as template and using primers to add BioBrick prefix and suffix. Mutagensis of amilGFP to remove PstI site and ccaS_EcoRI mutagenesis, round one.
After studying the experience section on the Registry’s homepage, we decided to change inverters to parts Q04400 (TetR inverter) and Q04510 (cI inverter). The inverters we originally chose were not so well characterized, and the promoters they used as output might be too weak for our system.
Transformation of parts Q04400 (TetR inverter) and Q04510 (cI inverter).
2011-07-12
The day started by running a gel of the mutagenized ccaS, amilCP-BB10 PCR product, and amilGFP_PstI linear plasmid. At the same time we prepared the samples (ccaR, ccaS, RBS-ho1 and RBS-pcyA) for sequencing. Plating of strains carrying plasmids with terminator B1001, PLlacO, pSB3T5 and pSB4K5. Purification of PCR products of ccaS_EcoRI, amilGFP_PstI, amilCP_BB10, and PcpcG2. Re-ligation of mutagenized ccaS and amilGFP, and cloning of amilCP_BB10.
The transformation of inverters from yesterday didn’t go well. The lambda-cI-inverter had only a few colonies, while the tetR inverter had no colonies at all. So TetR inverter has to be redone. This time the transformation used 2 µl of DNA from the MIT distribution. Re-streak of cI inverter transformants from 2011-07-11.
2011-07-13
We started the day by running EnvZ-KO, ccaS, EcoRI- digested amilCP and amilGFP on a gel. We obtained good results; there were no distinguishable multiple bands on the gel, although the bands seemed a bit smeared. Then we did transformation of ccaS_EcoRI, amilGFP_PstI, pSB1A3-amilCP, pSB-pcpcG2 and pSB4A5 backbone. Re-streak (There were one colony on the whole plate) and colony PCR of tetR inverter (DNA taken from well distributed from MIT).
Started overnight cultures of B1001 terminator, PlacO, PSB3T5 and PSB4K5-backbone (prepared for frozen stock + plasmid preparation) and finally RFP with RBS and lambda c1.inv (prepared for frozen stock + plasmid preparation).
The last thing we did was to make new plates of all the three antibiotics (A, C, K). We also made some plate with tetracycline.
2011-07-14
Re-streaking of ccaS_EcoRI, pGEM-amilGFP and pSB4A5. We were supposed to re-streak pSB1A3-amilCP and pSB1A3-PcpcG2 as well, but the transformants had no colonies at all.  We suspect wrong plasmid backbone or no ligase added during the cloning attempt. To investigate this the transformation was redone and we re-cloned pSB1A3-amilCP and pSB1A3-PcpcG2 again. O/n of pSB1A3 from the strain collection to test whether we had the right backbone in the frozen stock. We also transformed pSB1A3 backbone, and plated the transformants on A, C and K-plates. We have to find out what went wrong with the transformation of pSB1A3-amilCP and pSB1A3-PcpcG2. Plasmid prep of pSB1AK3-B1001, pSB1A2-R0011, pSB3T5-backbone, pSB4K5 backbone. Freezing glycerol stocks of pSB4K5-B0034 and λ-c1.inv. PCR amplification of tetR.inv with phusion, ran a gel of the PCR products.
The Chromophore  The second Biobrick assembly step on the chromophores was performed. Parts assembled: B0034-pcyA + B1001 and PLlacO (R0011) + B0034-ho1.
Output/promoter test plasmid                             Tomas extracted the standard promoter J23101, pSB3K3 and EYFP (E0034) from the MIT kit in order to prepare the test plasmid.
Evaluation  The sequencing result arrived today around lunchtime and they were really good. Both clones of B0034-pcyA that we sent looked fine. B0034-ho1 also looked good. The only clone sent of ccaR looked good. ccaS from Tabor’s plasmid was correctly amplified.
Summary so far
Things are going as planned but we have encountered some problem. We have successfully performed the first BioBrick assembly on the chromophore, extracted ccaR, ccaS and PcpcG2 from pJT122, mutagenized amilGFP_EcoRI and amilGFP_EcoRI and prepared a frozen stock of all the constructs generated so far. The sequencing data confirmed that everything was in order. However, we are still working on cph8 and have to incorporate new inverters in the system. We are happy with what we have accomplished so far and excited to tackle the challenges ahead.
2011-07-15
Erik L cloned tetR inverter into pSB1K3 and later transformed it. Lidaw and Johanna continued with the transformation of B0034-pcyA-B1001, Laura and Sibel transformed PLlacO-B0034-ho1 and pSB4K5. We did plasmid preparation of pSB1K3-B0032, o/n of pSB1C3-CcaS_EcoRI, pGEM-amilCP_PstI and pBS4A5.
mCherry is an alternative red output module that we found in the BioBrick registry. We decided to try it out since its red output is stronger than RFP. Thus we transformed the mCherry (J06702, with RBS and double terminator) from the kit.
2011-07-16
Started by doing plasmid preparation and freezing PSB4A5 stock. We also did plasmid preparation of pSB1A2-B0034. Then we proceeded to screen of PcpcG2 and pGEM-amilCP_PstI.
Made glycerol stock and & mutagenesis/BB10 PCR of pSB1C3-CcaS_EcoRI (-->ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI), pGEM-amilCP_PstI and pBS4A5 (amilGFP_Pst1_BB10). Only amilGFP_Pst1_BB10 showed a band on the gel. Re-streak of the transformations from yesterday and o/n of pcpcG2 and amilCP.
2011-07-17
Frozen stock and plasmid preparation of pcpcG2 and amilCP. Phosphorylation (Phosphorylation protocol), PCR purification, Diegestion, re-ligation, transformation and plating of ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI. PCR of AmilGFP_BB10. Plasmid preparation of pcpcG2 and amilCP.
O/n culture of: pSB3T5_CA2A (B0034-pcyA-term) pSB4K5_CA2B (pLlacO-B0034-ho1) pSB1K3_tetR.inv pSB1A3_mCherry pSB3K3-backbone pSB1K3_YF1 pSB1C3_BFP J61002-J23101 (test plasmid promotor)
Week 5
2011-07-18
Ran CA2A (B0034-pcyA-term), CA2B (pLlacO-B0034-ho1) and tetR.inv on gel and plasmid prepared of all the o/n cultueres from yesterday. Phusion PCR amplification (using BB10 primers) of non-Biobrick compatible cph8 from Voigt’s plasmid. This attempt was successful. We finally managed to get cph8. Gel ran for TagBFP and amilGFP. TagBFP came from colony PCR, and they turned out to have the right length.
Chromophore  We finally put together the final step in the chromophore assembly; CA2B + CA2A --> CA3
Red output assembly PompC + tetR.inv
Green output assembly PcpcG2 + B0034
Blue output assembly B0034+ amilCP
Green sensor assembly B0034 + ccaR B0034 + ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI (completely mutated, BioBrick-compatible)
We also assembled J23101 + mCherry (J06702)
Frozen stock pSB3T5_CA2A pSB4K5_CA2B  pSB1K3_tetR.inv J61002-J23101– test plasmid pSB1A3_mCherry pSB3K3-backbone pSB1K3_YF1
λ Red Create new plasmid for Lambda Red…………
YF1, FixJ and FixK2 promoter (or PfixK) arrived today. Due to the overwhelming amount of work, we decided to wait for a couple of days before transforming them.
2011-07-19
Transformation of all the Biobrick assemblies from yesterday and performed colony PCR on the plated ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI from 2011-07-17. We also did some O/N cultures of ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI. The gel showed nice and clear bands of the appropriate length.
Cloning of amilGFP_BB10 into pSB1K3 and later it was transformed together with YF1, FixJ and PfixK. These are parts of the blue sensor and they were synthesized by GenScript. Cph8 was cloned into pSB1K3.
The following parts were sent to sequencing: pcpcG2, CcaS_EcoRI_SpeI, CA2A, CA2B and tetR.inv. TagBFP and amilCP are sequenced by Erik Gullberg via IMBIM.
2011-07-20
Plasmid preparation of B0034-ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI, Re-streaking of pSB4A4-CA3, pSB1C3-PompC-tetR.inv, pSB1K3-B0034-ccaR, pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP, pSB1C3-PcpcG2-B0034, pSB1A3-J23101-mCherry. Transformation of pSB1K3-cph8 and Re-streak of pSB1K3-amilGFP, YF1, fixJ and PfixK.  This was done late because they were transformed very late. By the end of the day we did new ampecilin plates since there were non left.
The lambda red assembly plan must gain higher priority. The first assembly line involving EnvZ-KO could’ve been started earlier, but hasn’t. Thus, we have to hurry up the work on λ Red.
2011-07-21
Screening and o/n culture of the re-streaked plate from yesterday. Followed by Re-streak of pSB1K3-cph8, pSB1A3-B0032-BFP, pSB1K3-B0034-BFP, pSB1C3-B0032-YF1, pSB1C3-B0034-YF1.  We plasmid prepared pSB1K3 and pSB1C3 backbones.
Erik L became responsible for λ-Red in order to keep up with the assembly. He takes guidance from Erik Gullberg (supervisor) and together they lay down a good approach.  Evaluation
Sequencing result of ccaS showed an unwanted insert. It’s probably because of bad primer alignment during mutagenesis. Our initial conclusion was that the primers amplified the DNA of some contaminants. Theoretically, this shouldn’t have occurred, since we did PCR purification. The small DNA that caused the insert should’ve been removed.
Erik Gullberg thinks we might have taken a bad clone from the plate when doing mutagenesis to remove EcoRI. So he thinks we should take another clone post-EcoRI and tries it out again. The result of the sequencing reflects a very rare accident. Theoretically we should be able to do it again, without having the same problem. Otherwise, we are considering having Bioneer synthesize ccaS with codon optimization.  CA2B samples were gave poor results, it seemed like we accidently put two primers into the sequencing sample. This is probably due to stress.
Because of the work intensity and the stress people are starting to feel right now. Suggestions came up that we should move our weekly meeting on Mondays to Friday afternoon. Considering the current situation we decided to try it out next week.
2011-07-22
Frozen stock of: amilGFP YF1 FixJ PfixK pcpcG2-B0034 pompc-tetR.inv
PCR purification of B0034-ccaR and the above mentioned parts. New Re-streaking of 8 colonies of ccaS_EcoRI. This is because we believe we were unlucky to pick a colony with insert. Thus we try our luck with other colonies. Then we plasmid prepared  amilGFP, B0034-ccaR, pcpcG2-B0034 and pompc-tetR.inv.
Cloning of: pSB1AK3-YF1  pSB1C3 pUC57-fixJ pSB1K3 pUC57-YF1 pSB1K3 pUC57-PfixJ pSB1K3
O/N cultures and PCR screening of B0032-BFP, B0034-BFP, B0034-YFP and B0032-BFP.These are the parts of the output/promotor test plasmid assembly.
2011-07-23
Screening of : pSB4A5-CA3, pSB1C3-ccaS_EcoRI and pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP. Followed by screening of pSB1C3 – CcaS_EcoRI_SpeI (has insert).
We also made screening of Cph8, 4 samples (VF2 and VR, biobrick backbone) and making the glycerol frozen stock of Chp8 (un-mutated, Biobrick Backbone). Screened with gel and all the bands had accurate lengths.
Glycerol frozen stock & plasmid prep of: pSB1A3-B0032-BFP  pSB1K3-B0034-BFP pSB1C3-B0032-YFP  pSB1C3-B0034-YFP  Mutagenesis of pSB1C3 – CcaS_EcoRI_SpeI (new 2nd mut).
Output/promotor test plasmid assembly 3A assembly of: PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-BFP  PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-RFP  PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-RFP
Green output assembly pSB1A3 – PcpcG2 + B0034-amilGFP
Last thing was making O/N culture of pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP and of CA3.
Evaluation The new Ccas-EcoRI showed good bands, Ccas_EcoRI_SpeI did not (as expected due to illegal insert of approximately 50 bp shown after sequence data). The reason why we screened it again was to compare the band length with the new mutation of Ccas-EcoRI. Cph8 insert was successfully cloned in the pSB1K3. We had to redo PCR procedure of B0034-amilCP and do the second, new mutagenesis of ccaS_EcoRI to remove illegale SpeI restriction site.
2011-07-24
Started by running a gel on PCR-amplification products from yesterday. O/N- culture of pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP from yesterday had to be redone. The negative control was contaminated. CA3 was plasmid prepared.
3A assembly followed by transformation of
Output/promotor test plasmid assembly pSB1A3-J23101 + B0032-BFP pSB1K3-J23101 + B0032-YFP pSB1A3-PcpcG2 + B0034-BFP pSB1K3-PcpcG2 + B0034-YFP
Inverter test plasmid assembly pSB2K3-I0500 (Para/BAD) pSB1A2-E0430 (YFP)
Additional transformation of: pSB1K3-YF1 pSB1K3-FixJ pSB1K3-PfixK pSB1K3 -PompC-tetR.inv-B0034-BFP pSB1K3- PompC-tetR.inv-B0034 RFP pSB1K3- PompC-tetR.inv-B0034-YFP
Evaluation  ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI (new 2nd mutagenesis) showed no bands which means it need to be redone. B0034 – amilCP has accurate length. Lei tried to improve the result by change the annealing temperature to 57,3 oC. Cph8 showed accurate length.
Week 6
2011-07-25
Re-streak and screening of all transformants from yesterday. New transformation of pSB2K3-I0500 due to no colonies from yesterdays plating.
Making Lambda Red compatible BioBrick plasmids Screening of BioBrick plasmid pSB3T5_specR by using designed primers PEG3x5F (containing the whole terminator part and SacI restriction site) and primer, PEG3x5F2 (containing a part of the terminator and without SacI restriction site)
O/N-culture of pSB4A5-CA3, pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP and pSB1C3-YFP. Lei used his new protocol to screen ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI. He proceeded with phosphorylation, re-ligation and transformation.
Evaluation  specR showed no band for the primer PEG3x5F. We decided to do PCR again by using primer PEG3x5F2 as a template, PEG3x5F and PEG3x5R as primers in order to check the functionality of the primers PEG3x5F2. The new result was to short bands on the gel. The primer PEG3x5F2 doesn't work and we need to design and order new primers.  The mutagensis product of ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI showed accurate length on the gel and was therefore re-circulized.
2011-07-26
Re-streak of pSB2K3-I0500 and CcaS_EcoRI_SpeI. Second screening of pSB1K3-CcaSEcoRI_SpeI to ensure we got the cells with correct insert. This was followed by PCR purification.
PCR of pSB1A2-PcpcG2-B0034-amilGFP.
Plasmid preparation and glycerol-stock of: pSB1C3-E0034 (eYFP) pSB4A5-CA3 pSB1C3-B0034-amilCP
O/N-culture of re-streaked colonies: pSB1K3-YFI pSB1K3-FixJ pSB1K3-PfixK pSB1K3-cph8 pSB1C3-CcaSEcoRI_SpeI  pSB1A2-E0430 (YFP)- test plasmid pSB1A3-pcpcG2-B0034-amilGFP
Prepared samples for sequencing (CA3, B0034-amilCP, cph8, ccaS_EcoRI_SpeI, pcpcG2-B0034, PompC-tetR.inv, B0034-CcaR, pcpcG2-B0034-amilGFP).

Yesterdays’ samples were sent for sequencing. Glycerol stock and plasmid prep of the O/N cultures from Yesterdays’. Mohammed and Pikkei made new LB medium. We also screened our yellow output (PcpcG2-B0034-amilGFP) and the band on the gel showed accurate length.
Red output assembly PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-RFP in pSB1K3-B0032 and pSB1K3-B0034-RFP. We wanted to the test the output since the output can become either red or colorless.
O/N -cultures of pSB2K3-I0500 (inverter test plasmid assembly).
Evaluation  The screening showed that the assembly of yellow output was done successfully.

2011-07-29
Johanna and Laura did glycerol stock and plasmid prep of the O/N - cultures from 2011-07-28. They also re-transformed the red output (PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-RFP) and did the experiment from 2011-07-27 again since we could come to a solid conclusion the first time.
Blue output assembly  PfixK+λC1.inv
Blue sensor assembly  B0034+FixJ  B0034+YF1 These assemblies were later transformed.
O/N- cultures of pSB1K3-PcpcG2-B0034-YFP
Evaluation  There were no colonies on the re-streaked plate from yesterday. The result of the red output-assembly showed a plate with only white colonies (contain backbone pSB1K3-B0032) and one with both red and white (contain backbone pSB1K3-B0034-RFP). We picked the white colonies from the plate where the insert was put in pSB1K3-B0034-RFP- backbone which from now on be called red output with RFP (ROR). Hopefully this contains our insert and does not become induced by the TOP10-strain.
2011-07-30
Re-streak of all yesterday’s transformants. Today we also started making new competent TOP10 cells and inoculated them for the night. λ-Red plasmid is still processing slowly. But we ran a PCR to amplify envZ-KAN gene (Kan-cassette), followed by screening. O/N culture and screening of pSB1K3-PompC-tetR.inv-B0034-RFP. Point mutagenisis and O/N on pSB1K3-cph8_PstI since earlier mutagensis (first on) didn't work. Re-pleated, amplified and screening of earlier mutaded pSB1K3-Cph8_PstI.
Evaluation  The gel picture of amplified pSB1K3-cph8_PstI showed good result. It also seemed like the point mutagenesis of pSB1K3-cph8_PstI had an accurate length. The reason why we did a new mutagenesis is because we had a lot of trouble with our sensor before and we wanted to be on the safe side. The gel picture of envZ-KO and the red output didn't show any band and needs to be redone. At this stage the failure rate has increased leading reforms in the standard procedures so far. However, we are coming closer to the goal and need to keep to going.
2011-07-31
Testing the new top 10 competent cell by doing a transformation of PUC57 (with PfixK gene) and plating it on Amp plate. Running a gel of PfixK-λC1, B0034-YF1 and B0034-FixJ.

PT5lac promotor arrived today
Summary so far
Blue output: B0034-amilCP (BOA) is assembled and sequenced and is ready for the final step. PfixK-λC1.inv is assembled but not yet sequenced. Blue output will soon be ready for the final assembly.
Red output: Final assembly has been done several times with unsuccessful result. The reason for the problem is not clear. There seems to be a problem in the assembly of PompC-tetR.inv + B0034-RFP. Over and over again we can only see the band for tetR.inv on the gel. The sequence comes back with bad result every time. However, sequencing of the two individual components is good. Our screening method is might not be good enough.
We decided to resume the attempt with mcherry and use it as a backup in case we would fail totally.
Green output: Final assembly (pSB1K3-pcpcG2 + B0034-amilGFP) is done and the sequencing data showed perfect assembly. However, we are considering putting the final construct in a low copy plasmid (pSB3C5) because the promotor is slightly leaky.
Chromophore assembly: Last assembly pSB4A5-PlacO-B0034-ho1 (CA2B) + B0034-pcyA-Term (CA2A) has been done but the sequencing result showed double peaks. Needs to be sequenced again. We will also check the previous assembly step CA2B by sending it for sequencing. At this stage we are considering an alternative assembly. We believe that ho1 activity decreases the concentration of Hem. Hence we will put the PLlacO promotor last.
Red sensor: chp8 has been mutagenized two times to remove the illegal PstI site. The first time showed a large insert. Thus the mutagenezis has to be redone and send for sequencing.
Green sensor: the mutation of ccaS has been a tough one. It has to be mutagenized two times and the first sequencing result showed an insert. Assuming that we were un-fortuned to pick a colony with inserts. We went back and choose other colonies. It was the right assumption because the second sequencing was correct. ccaR is already assembled with B0034.
Blue sensor: Since the arrival of all the components the assembly of the blue sensor took of quit well. B0034-fixJ showed good sequencing results but B0034-YF1 showed no bands. Thus it needs to be assembled again!
λ-red: Is lagging behind and has to be taken care of. All the attempts with envZ-KO so fare show modest or no results.
Modelling: remains one of the toughest challenges. So far we haven’t found a model that can be easily implemented and understood. We are still working on it.
Bioneer  We sent an order to one of our sponsors Bioneer to synthesize tree color proteins that we can use as alternative output modules. aeBlue and cjBlue are different tones of blue and eforRed is a red protein.
Test plasmid assembly  Antionio and Thomas are focusing on making test plasmids. The aim to be able to meassure the output, promotor activity as well as inverter activity.
