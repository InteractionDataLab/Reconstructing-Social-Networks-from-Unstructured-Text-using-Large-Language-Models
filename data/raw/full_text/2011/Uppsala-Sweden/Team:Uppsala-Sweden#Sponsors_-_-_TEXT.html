Uppsala Student Union
Uppsala Student Union was founded on March 11th 1849 by the student nations in Uppsala in order to tackle questions that concerned all students, regardless of their background. Founding the Union meant the beginning of many years of work to improve the conditions for all students, both at Uppsala University and in society in general.
Over the years, the Student Union has worked with issues such as student housing, student financing, places for student representatives within the university, sport centres, student-friendly prices on course literature and the struggle for a separate Student Union house. In the 1920s, the newspaper Ergo was founded, which in the 1940s became the newspaper of Uppsala Student Union.

Bioneer
Bioneer
Bioneer Corporation is the first Korean biotechnology company established in 1992. The company has developed state of art molecular biology products and technologies including oligonucleotides, thermostable polymerases, and instruments of gene manipulation (automatic nucleic acid extractor, thermal cycler, real-time QPCR instruments and DNA sequencer). From its inception, Bioneer has invested in the integration of recombinant DNA technology, fermentation, biochemistry and nucleic acid chemistry in addition to mechanics, photonics and electronics. The company is positioned to fully-integrate its capability to develop next generation technologies in the post-genome era through the invention of new biochemistry and instruments. Bioneer now runs two production and research facilities in Korea which are a total of 226,000 square feet. Equipped with proprietary 384 synthesizers, these facilities contain a full production line for oligonucleotide and siRNA synthesis. In addition to DNA manufacturing, Bioneer processes recombinant proteins which are fermented and purified on proprietary purification systems.
