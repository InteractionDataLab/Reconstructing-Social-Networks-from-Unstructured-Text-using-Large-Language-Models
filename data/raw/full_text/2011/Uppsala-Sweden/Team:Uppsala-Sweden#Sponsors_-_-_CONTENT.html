</P></DIV><P>Uppsala Student Union was founded on March 11th 1849 by the student nations in Uppsala in order to tackle questions that concerned all students, regardless of their background. Founding the Union meant the beginning of many years of work to improve the conditions for all students, both at Uppsala University and in society in general.
</P><P>Over the years, the Student Union has worked with issues such as student housing, student financing, places for student representatives within the university, sport centres, student-friendly prices on course literature and the struggle for a separate Student Union house. In the 1920s, the newspaper Ergo was founded, which in the 1940s became the newspaper of Uppsala Student Union.
