Team:Uppsala-Sweden/Team/Human Practice
From 2011.igem.org
Objective
The Human Practice group comprises a few select members of our team. Synthetic biology is an emerging field of discipline within life science. In Sweden, the general public awaits us to spread the knowledge on this new field. Uppsala region has long thrived with companies of biotechnology. It's our task to bring Uppsala to the future of biotech, so our city maintains its role as the hub of life science researches in Sweden. Exhibitions and interactive activities are planned by the Human Practice group. By reaching out to different layers of society and people with different backgrounds, we hope to make the concept "synthetic biology" more than just a word for everybody.
