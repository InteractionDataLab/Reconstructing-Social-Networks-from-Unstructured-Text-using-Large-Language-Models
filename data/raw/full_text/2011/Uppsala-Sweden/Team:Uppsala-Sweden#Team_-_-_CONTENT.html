Dr. Forster received from the University of Adelaide, Australia, a B.Sc. majoring in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1983, a B.Sc. Hons. in Biochemistry in 1984, and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry in 1988. He was a post-doctoral fellow with Nobel laureate Sidney Altman at Yale and received an M.D. magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1996. He then completed a residency in Anatomical Pathology followed by research as an Instructor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. 
</P><P>He was Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, from 2005-2011 before moving to Uppsala University, Sweden, as a Professor. Dr. Forster discovered the hammerhead catalytic RNA structure, invented photobiotin for the preparation of nucleic acid diagnostics and external guide sequences for ribonuclease P, and has created unnatural genetic codes de novo. He has published in journals including Cell, JACS, Nature, PNAS and Science, edited a volume of Methods, and has authored patents. His technology has founded 3 biotech companies. He currently researches synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery.
</P><UL><LI><B>Anders Virtanen</B></LI></UL><P>
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. In his research, experimental systems based on mammalian and Drosophila cells are employed. A main goal is to understand how mRNA turnover/degradation, through the mRNA specific cap and poly(A) tail, is integrated with other essential mechanisms of gene expression/regulation. Another goal is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions. These studies will be of importance for the general understanding of mechanisms controlling the fate of eukaryotic mRNA. 
</P><P>The two greatest discoveries made by Anders Virtanen are: the first known mRNA polyA-site in a human virus; and the enzyme in the animal cells that removes polyA-tail from mRNA.

</P><P><B>Why I chose to participate in iGEM:</B> I wanted to share my experiences from last year to create a structured and competitive iGEM-team as well as improve my own skills, both inside and outside the lab. There is lot of criterias to consider for an iGEM-team, apart from laboration, that are very important even though the laboratory performance it´s the core of the whole project.
</P><P><B>Interests:</B> Meeting people and friends, my family, biotech, synthetic biology, green sustainable techniques, playing piano, listen and dancing salsa, windsurfing, football, psychology.
</P><P>Right now I´m also looking for a master degree project in the field of microbial metabolic engineering with synthetic biology applications in the pursuit of scalable biofuel production.
</P><P><B>Role:</B> Project manager. Started the recruitment and pilot studies since Oktober 2010 together with Lidaw, by organizing meetings and lectures. Structured this year iGEM-team.

</P><P><B>Why I chose to participate in iGEM:</B>I’m interested in biology in general but in synthetic biology in particular. iGEM gives me the opportunity to apply my engineer skills on biological system and be creative. Synthetic biology is the playgrounds were you can play with your fantasy no matter how childish it might seem. I like challenges and solving problems using a different approach.
</P><P>As was approaching the end of my first master year. I became very curious how synthetic biology would work in practice and the huge possibilities it can offer. Hence iGEM is the perfect opportunity to get a flavour of this exciting new field and cooperate with fellow students with the same interest.

Tried to transfer and got accepted by the Ivy League school, but came to Sweden to finish master. Participated in iGEM 2010 from Uppsala, providing the team with some iGEM experience. 
</P><P><B>Why I chose to participate in iGEM:</B> My involvement with iGEM 2010 was a late arrival. The reason I'm jumping on iGEM again is to create and fulfill a scientific project right from the beginning. No doubt, the things you learn from completing your iGEM project is both interesting and helpful for your academic career. 
</P><P><B>Interests:</B> I'd like to sing with my piano accompaniment. I'm also a bass in a student choir. In my spare time I hang out with my friends, my girlfriend, and try to indulge myself with music and science.

Masters Program in Bioinformatics<P><B>Age:</B>
27</P><P><B>Background:</B>
During  my Bachelor studies in the filed of computer science,I discovered that I had profound interest on simulating the living systems. later on it expand more in fields such as epigenetic and sequencing ; Therefore, I thought Bioinformatic was the route to combine my solid computer science skills with my interest to solve biological problems.</P><P><B>Why I chose to participate in iGEM:</B>
Due to my background, I lacked lab experiences, so participating on iGEM is a great opportunity for me to work in the laboratories and gain  tons of new knowledge. Having the  chance to step out of my comfort zone and learn a bit more about Syntetic Biology is one of the best things that had happened to me during my studies in Uppsala.</P><P><B>Interests:</B>
Family, friends, surfing the net and assemble jigsaw puzzle</P><P><B>Role:</B>
Responsible for Wiki. Work in the wet-lab.

<P><B>Age:</B> 23
</P><P><B>Background:</B> I studied  biology 4 years in Abant İzzet Baysal University in Turkey.
I started my first abroad  experience with Sweden three years ago as an exchange student at Halmstad University where I studied renewable energies. After my graduation,I came back to Sweden for my master studies.
Now, I think that studing biology in engineering perspective is very exciting,creative and more interesting to me.
</P><P><B>Why I chose to participate in iGEM:</B>I am very happy I could take part in this team.It is very fun to work with a team.I feel that I am learning a lot from my team-mates not only how to collaborate and manage a Project but also I improve my communication skills and prova min Svenska :)
I define synthetic biology as a fascinating world of science where you can apply your imaginations  and create your fascinating designs.
I believe that ‘iGEM’ competition is a really good start to get in this fascinating world.
‘Thanks to iGEM providing this  great oppurtunity to us’.

<P><B>Age:</B> 19
</P><P><B>Background:</B> First year student in the biotech. program in Uppsala University. At an early age I realized that  science was the only thing that temporarily could clench my thirst for answers and satisfy my curious nature. Not long after this relevation I discovered the amazing field which many referred to as: biology. The fact that biology were the soruce of so many unanswered questions, conveyed me that this was the field which I wanted to understand as well as contribute to.
</P><P><B>Why I chose to participate in iGEM:</B> The very moment the concept of iGEM was presented to me, I knew that this was something I wanted to participate in. Basically, this appealed me in every way possible; a scientific research  project made easy through standardisation - only the sky was the limit. Disregarding my inexperience as a first year student I decided to try to join the team – a decision I will never regret.
</P><P><B>Interests:</B> As with many others in the team - friends, music and studies are that which consumes most of my time, together with university related commitments.
