Biology Education Centre : IBG
IBG is the central administrative organisation for all undergraduate and master level education within biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics at Uppsala University. More than 100 different courses are arranged by us yearly, and almost 2000 students attend our courses during some part of the year. The majority of teachers are directly involved in scientific projects at the university, implying high quality courses closely connected to ongoing research and recent findings.
