Preparation of cells for Transmission Electron Microscopy (August 29th to Sept 1st)
DH5α Cells containing BBa_K542008 as well as controls containing only plasmid pSB1C3 were grown overnight at 37°C.
August 29th, 2011
Approximately 400μL of the cells that were picked Aug. 28th  were resuspended in 5mL SOC media, and induced with 5μL or 10μL of 1M IPTG. Cells were again incubated at 37°C for approximately 4 hours. Cells were then spun down at 6000xg for 2 minutes.
Cells were resuspended in 500μL gluteraldehyde/formaldehyde fixative and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.  The solution was then spun at 6000xg  for 2 minutes.
Cell pellet was resuspended in 0.1 sodium cacodylate buffer and incubated for 10 minutes. Solution was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 6000xg.  This step was repeated an additional 2 times. Cells were then resuspended in 1% osmium tetroxide fixative in 0.1M CaC buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Solution was centrifuged at 6000xg for 2 minutes.  Cells were then resuspended in Milli-Q H2O.
The cells were spun down at 10000xg for 5 minutes, and resuspended in 4% BIO-RAD standard low melting temperature agarose at 60°C. A drop of this cell-agarose mixture was then added to slides in order to harden, and incubated in Milli-Q H2O overnight.
August 30th, 2011
Agarose-cell mixtures were cut into cubes of approximately 1mm x 1mm x 1mm.
They were incubated in increasing alcohol concentrations:
50% - 5min
70% - 10 min
80% - 10 min
90% - 10 min
95% - 2 x 10 min
100% - 2 x 10 min
Abs 100% - 3 x 10 min
Then increasing concentrations of resin on rotator:
25% - 1 hr
50% - 1 hr
75% - 2 hr
100% - 15 min
100% - overnight
The cubes were left in 100% resin overnight on rotator.
August 31st, 2011
The cubes from the 100% resin were then placed in tubes with fresh resin and left in an oven for 24 hours to harden.
September
September 1st, 2011
The resin-embedded cubes of cells were then thin sectioned and placed on a carbon grid. They were stained with uranyl acetate and then positively stained with lead citrate then viewed under transmission electron microscope with the help of Doug Bray.

Restriction :
J04500 in pSB1AK3 SpeI and PstI
Enhanced lumazine synthase-Dt in pSB1C3: XbaI and PstI
J04500-Enhanced lumazine synthase in pSB1AK3: EcoRI and SpeI
Dt in psb1AK3: EcoRI and XbaI
Enhanced lumazine synthase in pSB1C3: EcoRI and SpeI
Dt in pSB1A2: EcoRI and SpeI
Restriction mixture into freezer overnight after 1 hour at 37 Degrees C
September 9th, 2011
Ran agarose gel with samples from September 8th.
Note: more issues with the Gels, Volts too low, Amp too high, Assistance from Weiden lab PhD student, explains in depth how gel rigs, power packs and agarose all work, Helped trouble shoot each area, which lead to Changing the 1X TAE from weiden lab stock.  This gave constant Voltage and lowered the amps, since the agarose gel was made from our TAE, gel had to be run at constant amps for several hours to prevent it from melting.
Gel extraction went well! All pieces showed up with the exception of J04500-Enhanced lumazine in pSB1AK3
Ligations of
J04500 and Enhanced lumazine synthase-Dt in pSB1C3
Enhanced lumazine synthase and Dt in pSB1AK3
Enhanced lumazine synthase and Dt in pSB1A2
September 10th, 2011
Assembly of Ptet-Rbs in pSB1A2 to have XylE- Arg Tag-dt
Restriction of:
pTet-rbs with SpeI and PstI
XylE Atag- dt with XbaI and PstI
While samples restricted at 37 degrees Celcus for 1 hour, we made a 1% TAE agarose gel using TAE from Weiden stocks for both Gel and buffer.
Agarose gel ran at 80Volts for 60 minutes.   Was very happy to see the gel running at normal Amps and reaching regular Volts, No more melting Gels!!
Gel analysis by UV indicated restrictions did not work for XylE
September 11th, 2011
3 days back and nothing has worked, persistence is the only way we're going to get through this!!
Built a new copy of Xyle + S04261 since the stock copy is unaccounted for.
Found prerestricted Xyle and S04261 in team 1 book, and located in freezer, performed an overnight ligation Restricted Enhansed Lumazine Synthase-Dt in pSB1C3 cut at EcoRI and XbaI to later ligate with previously restricted J04500 cut at EcoRI and SpeI
Restricted :
J04500 out of pSB1AK3 with EcoRI and SpeI (to be ligated with the Enhanced lunazine synthase-dt in pSB1C3)
Enhanced lumazine synthase in pSB1C3 with SpeI and PstI
dt D6 was restricted at XbaI and PstI. (later to learned I should have left dt in plasmid and removed the enhanced lumazine synthase, Dt was too small and ran off gel.)
Ran all parts on a 1% TAE agarose gel
Enhanced lumazine synthase-dt,  J04500, and Enhanced lumazine synthase in pSB1C3 all restricted well, but dt D6 did not as it was too small and ran off the gel.
Ligation of each of the Enhanced lumazine synthase-dt with the gel extracted J04500 and the previously restricted J04500
September 12th, 2011
Transformed and plated cells from ligation mixture from September 11th
September 13th,2011
End of the first Week worth of classes, and still nothing grows/ works Why??  I found out that I am using the wrong enzymes, a type that wont heat kill (Later questioned, since I'm running a gel for extraction.  I was informed the heat kill process doesn’t need to be done when running a gel for extraction when I was introduced to the gel extractions, I asked why are we doing it this way, the answer was ‘It’s more efficient!’ apparently in theory only)
Ok one More Kick at it, New enzymes check, Proper TAE check, advice from Phd students Check, Objective: Get something to work! Feeling I have it all figured now, I set forth once more.
Restriction of:
J04500 in pSB1AK3 with at SpeI and PstI
Enhanced lumazine synthase- Dt with at EcoR1 and PstI
J04500-Enhanced lumazine synthase with EcoRI and SpeI
dt D7 in pSB1AK3 with EcoRI and XbaI
Enhanced lumazine synthase with EcoRI and SpeI
dt D6 in pSB1A2 Cutting with EcoRI and XbaI
pTet-Rbs in pSB1A2 with at SpeI and PstI
XylE-ATag-Dt with XbaI and PstI
Made Gel while Restrictions incubated,
1% TAE Agarose Gel then stored in fridge overnight, Note: don’t store on top shelf, Gel will freeze
Stored restricted DNA in Freezer overnight to be used in gel in the morning,
September 14th, 2011
Gel froze overnight in fridge, so made two new 1% TAE agarose gels (one small one large)  ( so much for loading a gel and going to class!)
Ran gels at 80Volts for 90 minutes
Results:
Enhanced lumazine synthase –dt did not work (restriction issue?)
J04500 –Enhanced lumazine synthase did not work(restriction issues?)
XylE –ATag-dt was not on gel (portion too small for successful gel extraction/ not enough lanes)
Only Enhanced lumazine synthase and dt D6 in pSB1A2 were available to  proceed to gel extraction,
Gel Extraction Unsuccessful Pack up go home try again in a few days
September 21st, 2011
Cells containing the BBa_K542008 construct as well as controls containing pSB1C3  were grown overnight at 37°C.
September 22nd, 2011
Cells grown on September 21st, 2011 were spun down at 10,000rpm and then resuspended in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The solution was centrifuged at 10,000rpm, decanted and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and left overnight.
September 23rd, 2011
The 4%PFA-cell solution was then centrifuged at 10,000rpm and cells were resuspended in glycerol. The glycerol-cell mixtures were then placed on slides, coverslipped and sealed.
The slides were viewed with an Olympus FV1000 spectral confocal at 60X magnification.
