Overnight culture grown by Justin, 12ml of overnight culture, of E. Coli Dh5alpha J04500-K249002- B0017- I13453-P0040-K331033-K331035, in the pSB1C3 Vector, was inoculated in 4 x 500ml LB flasks, with 500micro liter of Chloramphenicol and grown up to OD600 of 0.0978
August 29th, 2011
Ran SDS page of August 28th, overexpression, SDS sample preparation protocol was followed
The SDS page was run at 80Volts for 15 mins and 180Volts for 45mins
Stained in Coomassie blue for 30 mins and distained over night
August 31, 2011
Assembly of:
J04500-Enhanced Lumazine synthase cut out of pSB1AK3 at EcoRI and SpeI ligated to B0015 cut at EcoRI and XbaI in pSB1AK3
Ptet-rbs in pSB1A2 cut at SpeI and PStI Ligated to XylE - arginine tag cut at XbaI and PstI.
Followed Restriction, Gel Extraction protocols
Note: J04500 –Enhanced Lumazine synthase and Xyle – agrinine tag –dt did not Cut out of plasmid.  B0015 in pSB1AK3, and Ptet-rbs in pSB1A2 were found around the right sizes
September
September 3rd, 2011
Repeated August 31 assembly
Sept 14th,2011
Show how effective BamHI is in degrading E.coli DH5α Genomic DNA
2 overnight cultures were picked in 50 ml flasks with 50micro liters of Ampicillin and were inoculated with BamHI and pLacI from Glycerol stock
16ml of pLacI from overnight culture were used to inoculate 250ml of Lb with 250micro liters of Ampicillin to bring it to an OD600 of 0.118
11.2 ml of BamHI overnight culture was used to inoculate 250ml of LB to an OD600 of 0.100
September 17th, 2011
Repeat, the August 14th BamHI experiment due to the spectrophotometer being inaccurate
September 19th, 2011
Isolation of genomic DNA from BamHI cells by following the Qiagen Blood and Tissue Kit protocol for isolating genomic DNA of gram-negative bacteria
September 21, 2011
Overnight culture of full construct (lumazine synthase – K331033 – K331035, K331033 and K331035) for FRET experiments
Selected cells were induced with arabinose.
All cells showed growth after 15 hours in shaker at 37 degrees Celsius.
September 22, 2011
Continued work from September 21
Spun down cells and re-suspended in LB media and checked Optical Density of 1 ml of culture and brought them to 1 OD
Signs of FRET but nothing confirmed
Note: This is something we will be working on continuously up until Boston
