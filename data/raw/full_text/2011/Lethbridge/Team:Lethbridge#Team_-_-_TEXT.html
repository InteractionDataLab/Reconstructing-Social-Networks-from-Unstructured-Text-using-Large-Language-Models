Students
Isaac Ward
I am from Edmonton though grew up in the small town of Vermilion.  There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am.  I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology.  I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years.  I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved.  It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much.
Ben Vuong
I was born and raised in Lethbridge for the whole span of my life. I have just finished up my first year and will be entering my second year at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biochemistry. This is my first year with iGEM, and I am looking forward to the knowledge to be gained from the members of the team. I plan on pursuing the career of a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. Badminton is one of my favourite activities to do. I enjoy listening to contemporary R&B music as well Hip-Hop such as Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Claude Kelly, Frankie J and Lupe Fiasco.
Anthony Vuong
Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my fourth year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my second year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).
Justin Vigar
I'm Justin. I think biology is way more fun when looking at it though the eyes of an engineer, so synthetic biology is a perfect fit for me. I am very excited to be working full-time for the Lethbridge iGEM team for the second year in a row. When not in the lab I downhill/freeride mountain bike, ride motocross, play guitar, and enjoy walks on the beach in San Francisco.
Dustin Smith
Hi! I'm Dustin. I was born and raised in Lethbridge and I am a third year biochem student. This is my first year in iGEM and it has been a fascinating experience thus far. The U of L iGEM team is a great group to work with and I'm happy to be a part of it. Outside of school my favorite activities are snowboarding, golfing or hanging out with friends.
Ryan Pederson
My name is pronounced identically to Peterson; the first syllable is not pronounced the same as in peddle, or pedestrian. Get it wrong and you will force me to get you a cask of Amontillado or possibly an orangutan. I have always been correctly known as a science guy among my friends, just as Prospero was known to throw killer parties, and so when iGEM came tapping at my door I graciously jumped on that beating floor board. Since then, everything seems to be going well, my house has not collapsed and all of my four cats still have both their eyes. I am a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, and, as such, I have placed nine references to different works of Poe in this paragraph. This is my first year in iGEM and I am going into my fourth year of neuroscience.

Terrance Myers
Dominic Mudiayi
I was born in the D.R.Congo and I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Lethbridge, majoring in biology. This is my second year in iGEM and I am looking forward to the fun and insightful times with the team this year. When not doing biochemistry research in lab, I can be found playing sports(track and field, soccer, rugby, cricket, hockey..etc) running or reading a good book.
Boris Lam
In north Lethbridgedelphia born and raised, at the uni is where I spend most of my days. I will be entering my third year majoring in biology, and my first year as a member of the iGEM team at the University of Lethbridge. In the future, my goal is to become a pediatric hematologist/oncologist and to own a killer car collection. In my free time, I like to play sports (mostly hockey) or playing video games, especially shooters, on my Xbox 360.
Fun Fact: According to Google, I am a yo-yo master and the winner of the 2002 France Yo-Yo championship.
Katherine Gzyl
Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.
Dipankar Goyal
Having moved numerous times in my lifetime, I finally ended up in Lethbridge for my undergraduate degree (Bachelors in Neuroscience). I have always been interested in pursuing a career in medicine, especially the doctors without border program. Designing medicines is highly related to synthetic biology, thus my interest in the emerging field of synthetic biology was inevitable. Outside of the science world, I live my life playing soccer, curling and cricket.
Jenna Friedt
Hello! I am a recent graduate from the U of L, earning my B.Sc. in Biochemistry this past spring. For as long as I can remember, science has been a keen interest of mine, and iGEM seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore the many different aspects involved in scientific research and innovation. In my spare time, I enjoy knitting, reading, and doing crossword puzzles (and despite what you may think, I’m not an old lady). Cheesy romance movies and bad science films can keep me entertained for hours, as well as enjoying a sparkling cold beverage on the patio with good friends, while the sun sets in the background.
Sutherland Dube
Hi I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I am currently a 4th year student at the U of L majoring in Neuroscience. This is my first year on the iGEM team and so far it has been great! Being a neuroscience major, iGEM has been awesome at providing the opportunity to participate in research outside of my field of study. When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading.
Nathan Dawson
Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.
Morgan Cumming
Originally from Calgary, AB I came to Lethbridge to pursue a lifelong career in academia. I figure it's the best way to avoid having to start real life. This being my first year in iGEM, I am really enjoying the learning curve and the new experiences. I cannot wait for more workshops and conferences to meet new people. When I've finally got some time off I enjoy getting outside, away from distractions, with great views and good friends. Or playing with my stereo (and you thought vinyl was dead.)
Mackenzie Coatham
Hi iGEMers! My name is Mackenzie and I’m a fourth year biochemistry major who is competing in iGEM for a THIRD time!  I’ve been involved in scientific research since high school and still love every minute of studying proteins in translation or exploring what synthetic biology has to offer.  When I’m not in a lab coat holding a pipette, I can often be found dancing or watching my fair share of So You Think You Can Dance!
Lisza Bruder
Hello!!  My name is Lisza and I have just completed my BSc in biochemistry and this will be my third year involved with iGEM.  I love being involved with research and academia which means that iGEM is perfect for me.  iGEM gives me another area of research to explore that is outside of my usual field of biochemistry.  One of the best things about iGEM is being able to help other students learn and watch them grow over the season.
Harland Brandon
I am a fourth year Biochemistry student and second year iGEM team member at the University of Lethbridge. Currently I am enjoying doing research not just with iGEM but in a research lab as well. I enjoy most things from science, to writing, to enjoying a good beer upon occasion. This year I am really looking forward to contributing to the synthetic biology community and our iGEM team. Aside from this rather bland biography of myself here is another version which should be able to put a smile on your face cortesy of my wildly wacky imagination:
It has long since been thought that the Harland was only a beast of myth, one which was said to a close relative to the tooth fairy but instead steals left over food from fridges and unguarded chip bowls. He is a beast with short blond hair and a height nearing that of a small llama. If provoked he will be easily startled and will release his bowels in order to disgust a potential threat. Not much is known about this magnificant creature aside from its high metabolism. Scientists have expressed interest in studying the Harland's digestive system in hopes of curing diabetes, although it is not known why scientists believe this creature holds the key to solving diabetes.
Advisors
Adam Smith
This is my second year as a member of the University of Lethbridge's iGEM team, and I am very excited to be back. I am taking a step back from my role last year as a lab technician, and am acting as an advisor on laboratory activities.
I am currently working as a research assistant in the molecular biology/biochemistry labs of Dr. L. Brent Selinger and Dr. Steven Mosimann, and hope that my knowledge and experience will influence this year's iGEM team positively.
In my spare time, I enjoy golfing or skiing, depending on the season, or playing Angry Birds in any season.
Fan Mo
Fan currently works as a lab technician in the Wieden lab. In her spare time she likes to play badminton, computer games and dancing in the rain. She currently holds the title for best score playing gold miner among the Wieden lab. This is her third year in iGEM as a supervisor and looks forward to another year on the team.
Jeffrey Fischer
Currently, I'm in the process of finishing my PhD in Biomolecular Science in HJ Wieden's lab. This is my third year in iGEM, and I'm delighted to be back and working with the team yet again. I am extremely busy in the lab as always, and in November, I will become a Papa! This year promises to be the best that the U of L iGEM has had yet.
Supervisors
Hans-Joachim Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
A. William Smith
Smith has a BS chem, BFA movement, BA mathematics, BM music theory and composition, MFA interdisciplinary, and PhD History of Theatre, History of Art. He started the New Media Department at the U of L teaching the first class in 1999. He loves getting out of his comfort zone [and encouraging others to get out of theirs].
