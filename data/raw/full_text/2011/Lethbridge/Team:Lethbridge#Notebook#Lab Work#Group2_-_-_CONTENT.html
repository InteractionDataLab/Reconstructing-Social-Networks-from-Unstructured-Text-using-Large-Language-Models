Different conditions are used in the blunt end ligation. Since puc19 has to be cut bluntly half the samples have the blunt end restriction enzyme heat killed after the restriction. Blue/white colony screening has to be used for puc19 cloning which requires X-Gal and IPTG. Solutions of these are made for the plates.
