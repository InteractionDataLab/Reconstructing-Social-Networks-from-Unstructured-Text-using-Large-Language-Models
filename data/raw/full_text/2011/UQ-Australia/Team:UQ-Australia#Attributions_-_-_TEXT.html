Big thanks to all of the supervisors for watching over us and guiding us through the project. Thanks also to David Simmons, Georgia Kafer and their lab for hosting us.
Thanks also go to the staff of the School of Biomedical Sciences for hosting us and providing a fun and safe environment for us.
It should be known that although the team supervisors helped us learn the necessary laboratory skills and practices to be used in this project, all experiments and other work related to the iGEM project (including fundraising, outreach, safety analysis and modelling) were conducted by the students of the UQ Australia team.
We would also like to thank the following people for their contributions during our project:
Dr. Susan Rowland from School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences , The University of Queensland , for sharing her bacterial expertise with us and guiding us with the project. We are also indebted to her for providing us with plasmid vectors pET16.1 and pBAD containing lacI and araC.
Dr. Melissa Davis from Queensland Facility for Advanced Bioinformatics , Institute for Molecular Biosciences , The University of Queensland for guiding us through the modelling of kinetics and CellDesigner.
Prof. Alex Ninfa from University of Michigan , for his expert knowledge on oscillatory system and his bacterial strain 3.300L*G. We also thank him for advising us on how to integrate genes into the bacterial chromosome.
Tom Kuhlman from the Cox Lab at Princeton University for sharing his knowledge of bacterial chromosome integration and sending us the plasmids pTKRED, pTKIP and pTKS/CS.
Staff and students of PHYS3051/PHYS7250 Fields in Physics and PHYS3900/PHYS7900 Perspectives in Physics Research by the School of Mathematics and Physics at The University of Queensland for their support and encouragement with the microscopy and synchronisation modelling reviews.
James Bennett from Faculty of Science at The University of Queensland for his illuminating contribution to the microscopy modelling, which was also for PHYS3900/PHYS7900 Perspectives in Physics Research .
Dr. Tim Kastelle from UQ Business School , David Douglas from School of History, Philosophy, Religion and Classics at the University of Queensland and Dr. Sampsung Shi and Prof. Anne Fitzgerald and her lab from Faculty of Law from Queensland University of Technology for their advice with the sharing review.
Randy Rettberg from iGEM for his discussion on patenting and how it relates to the competition and Science in general.
