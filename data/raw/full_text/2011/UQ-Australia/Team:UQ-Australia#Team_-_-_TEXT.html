The 2011 iGEM team from the University of Queensland consists of six undergraduates based at the School of Biomedical Sciences. We worked mainly in the Thomas and Simmons labs.
Our team comes from a diverse range of fields, including Biotechnology, Biomedical Science and Physics. We are all third year students with differing levels of laboratory experience who wanted to expand our skills and explore the exciting new field of synthetic biology! UQ has only participated in iGEM once before, so the team and our supervisors were all learning as we went along. Nevertheless, we feel like we accomplished a lot this year and hope that future UQ teams will be able to continue our work.
