Attributions
During this period we continued to plan the modeling of our circuit, as well as developing plans for our Outreach activities. We had to wait for certain parts to be synthesized and then had a number of issues with the cloning of these parts.
Summary of Lab Work
Parts for ordered to be synthesized and upon arrival were digested with EcoRI and PstI.
However, a gel shows that the digestion did not work for the part Plac/ara.
The pSB1C3 sample from the iGEM distribution was resuspended and transformed before being digested with EcoRI and PstI.
Following digestion we used the MinElute PCR Purification kit and Nanodrop revealed 20ng/ul plasmid concentration.
We performed a ligation with araC gene to go into the pSB1C3 backbone.
Finally, we prepared more antibiotic plates (Amp, Kan and Chlor)
