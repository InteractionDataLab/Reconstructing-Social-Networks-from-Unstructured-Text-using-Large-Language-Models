We have four questions to address:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher, public, and environmental safety?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher, public, and environmental safety?
Any expected safety issues regarding researchers have been addressed prior to beginning the experimental work for iGEM. Members attended a series of inductions including Physical Containment 2 (PC2) training, Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) , and separate inductions for each lab by respective lab managers. Undergoing PC2 training allows us to work with Genetically Modified materials inside a PC2 lab, required for working with genetically modified organisms. Specific laboratory training was recorded in the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) folder. This training was in conjunction to standard university online general induction training, annual fire safety training, and lab safety training. Student members were supervised in a lab environment when carrying out lab procedures or using lab equipments that required supervision, all with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coat, gloves, closed shoes, and safety goggles; as indicated by material safety data sheets (MSDS) evaluated in risk assessments.
Any expected safety issues regarding public safety, have also been addressed prior to commencement of experimental work. To ensure the safety of the general public, no materials within the lab are exposed to the public or the environment. Transporting materials from one lab to another was done with the material in a double-sealed container. No personnel without PC2 training were allowed in the lab. When disposing waste materials, biohazardous waste materials were disposed in the appropriate biohazard bin, likewise with sharps to ensure that general staff were not handling contaminated materials. Should an incident occur where others are placed in danger, an incident report is filed and handled by relevant personnel.
Any expected issues regarding environmental quality, have also been addressed prior to commencement experimental work. To ensure environmental safety, Environmental Management System (EMS) induction was carried out, together with PC2 training. Imported goods are required to go through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) . They have rules regulating what is allowed into the country to ensure that the environment is not  harmed. Therefore, any biological materials that we received from overseas or planning to send to overseas (for our project) is abides by the rules of AQIS .
The security of the materials was maintained in the PC2 laboratory. The containment in the laboratory prevents untrained personnel from accessing materials. If we were to handle any Security Sensitive Biological Agents (SSBAs) , we would first consult the Biosafety Advisors at the University of Queensland.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We anticipate that issues could be raised when transporting biological materials between Australia and Overseas. Imported goods are required to go through AQIS who regulate what is allowed into the country to ensure that the environment is not harmed.  Documentation will be submitted to the Registry regarding the transportation of biological materials to and from Australia.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The University of Queensland has an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) who ensures that the university remains an accredited organisation under the Gene Technology Act and complies with the Queensland Workplace Health and Safety Act , Australian Standard 2243.3 Safety In Laboratories: Microbiological Safety and Containment, AQIS and OGTR .
The EMS is implemented by Sustainability Office at the University of Queensland ensures that all university personnel are familiar with environmental management relevant to them.
There is an OHS committee at the School of Biomedical Sciences (where we are based) to ensure the safety of the researchers, public, and the environment. This is comprised of Workplace Health and Safety officers (WHSOs), AQIS representatives, Workplace Health and Safety Representatives (WHSR), Biosafety Advisors, and Work Injury Management Team.
A discussion with the WHSOs resulted in the training of students. The students received PC2 training, OHS and EMS induction and completed the online general safety, fire and laboratory training as well as laboratory specific training from the lab manager.
In Australia, the Gene Technology Act is national set of guidelines regulated by the OGTR . AQIS regulates the transportation of materials in and out of the country.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Current safety regulations have thus far been sufficient in maintaining the safety of the researchers, public and environment. Australia has its own set of regulations. We have informed iGEM of these regulations specific to Australia and anticipate that this information would update the iGEM safety information accessible to other teams.
