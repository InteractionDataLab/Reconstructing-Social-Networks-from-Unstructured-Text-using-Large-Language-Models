Attributions
In this period of time we continued to work on the cloning of our parts, where we encountered a number of issues. We also conducted a number of outreach activities, such as the Biofutures camp, and began work on an analysis of patent practices and how this relates to iGEM's registry.
Summary of Lab Work
We ligated araC and pBAD into the iGEM plasmid backbone. However, after transforming them parts and then miniprepping them we found that the ligation was not successful.
We re-suspended a number of parts from the iGEM distribution kit, including LacI, GFP and pSB3K3 plasmid backbone.
These parts were transformed, as were some other genes we had synthesized. We also transformed more of the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone.
Minipreps were done of the transformations of GFP, lacI, Plac/ara, GlnAp2. Nanodrop of the final concentrations: GFP = 46.6ng/ul LacI = 40.8ng/ul Plac/ara = 81.6ng/ul GlnAp2 = 54.4ng/ul
3ml culture of the pSB1C3 transformations was prepared, followed by miniprep. Nandrop = 94.9ng/ul
