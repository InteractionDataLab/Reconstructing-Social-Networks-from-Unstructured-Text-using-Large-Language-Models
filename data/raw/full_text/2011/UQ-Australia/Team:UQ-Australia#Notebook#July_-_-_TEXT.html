During July, we continued to optimize our lab protocols, particularly the PCR conditions to add on our BioBrick ends. This was met with moderate success, while most of our cloning still did not go as planned.
Summary of Lab Work
We conducted a number of heat-cycle PCRs to find the optimal conditions to amplify the lacI and araC genes. These tests were promising and we were able to get a lacI sample at 16.3ng/ul
However, our other lab work did not progress well, with none of the cloning of the parts we had synthesized working.
