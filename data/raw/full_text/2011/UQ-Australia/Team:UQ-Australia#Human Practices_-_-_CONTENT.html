In particular, we have <A href="#Outreach"><B>presented synthetic biology</B></A> to high school students at the <A href="#Biofutures"><B>BioFutures</B></A> camp and to <A href="#PAIN_Physics_Society"><B>undergraduate physics students</B></A>. Additionally, we have reviewed the <A href="#Patenting"><B>issue of patented parts</B></A> present to iGEM, and have been involved in the <A href="#Collaboration"><B>collaborative effort</B></A> to create CommunityBricks and AlumniGEM. All these activities are summarised below.
</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Patenting"><SPAN style="color:#558822">Patenting</SPAN></SPAN></H2><P>In a dynamic field such as synthetic biology, discovery moves at an astounding pace and is driven by the findings of groups from all around the world. However, conflict often arises when the choice between collaboration and commercialisation arises, and consequently patents have become commonplace in the scientific world. In the last 5 years, 34% of respondents had applied for or received a patent on their findings. Additionally, 68% stated that they had sent research tools to others in academia [1]. This is especially relevant in iGEM, a competition whose explicit aim is to remain open source and collaborative. We examine whether this is a realistic or achievable goal within the framework of patents in the scientific world. 
</P><P>
Within iGEM, the stipulation that all BioBricks must remain open source and redistributable means that patented material is inherently excluded from submission. This sort of restriction differs somewhat from the usual research experience, where 91% of scientists have not checked for patents on the material they used in the last 5 years [1]. However, iGEM falls in a unique `grey area’, which effectively prevents the use of any patented materials by participating teams with the requirement to submit their parts to the Registry to be redistributed. Although teams are using parts solely for research purposes, the nature of the registry and iGEM’s distribution kits means that by redistributing parts iGEM would be infringing on the patent holder. The UQ-Australia iGEM team is limited in their project due to patents on key components.
</P><P>
In the past, the issue of patenting has been less significant on iGEM with a recent survey indicating that less than twenty teams faced any legal issues regarding patenting and their parts [2]. This would likely be since the majority of teams worked in bacteria, where the parts have either never been patented, or any patents have since expired. However, as more explore synthetic biology in mammalian projects, patenting is going to become an unavoidable issue. Consequently, we propose two possible mechanisms for iGEM to handle patents on biological parts.
</P><P>
The first - and seemingly simplest - solution is to simply allow teams to use patented parts, and require them to submit the sequences online (including detailed information on how they modified and used it), but without requiring the submission of physical DNA samples. This would mean that other teams could still utilise parts by purchasing them direct from the license holder and modifying them as per the instructions, without the traffic or redistribution of any patented parts. The problem with this idea is that it is highly likely that the iGEM registry would then rapidly fill with these ‘information only’ pieces that cannot be included in the distribution kit. This goes against the central aim of iGEM and the BioBrick model if there is no sharing of parts. A slight alternative to this model would be to limit the number of patented parts each team could use and submit in such a way, but we feel that this still goes against the aims of iGEM, and depending on the individual team’s project may well still present problems.
</P><P>
As a result, we have developed another alternative solution. In this case, we propose that iGEM should enter into formal agreements with the companies or individuals holding the license of many patented materials. This could operate in a similar manner to iGEM’s current sponsorship agreements, whereby the companies in question get advertising on the iGEM website, or a presence at the jamborees, and in return they provide iGEM with an overarching licence agreement that allows the distribution of patented parts within the competition (i.e. amongst registered teams). In this way, the registry could continue operating as is, and teams would be unhindered in taking on their projects. This avoids the current ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ mentality that some has, and alleviates the issue of unwary teams not knowing to search for patents before initiating their projects. 
</P><P>
However, we do see that this plan could open iGEM up to the influence of outside corporations, and of course that not all companies may be willing to undertake such a partnership. To keep iGEM independent of such parties, we think a well-defined agreement would be required that specifies exactly what each party agrees to, which we assume must be similar to any agreement iGEM has with its current sponsors. In effect, this agreement would just be another form of sponsorship, with both parties benefiting; the patent holders get access and exposure to a cohort of intelligent young scientists who will soon be entering the workforce or undertaking further research, while iGEM gets the ability to redistribute and modify these items within the competition’s community.
</P><P>
We foresee this option as a solution that complies with the aims of both patent-holders and iGEM:
</P><P>Patent holders:
</P><UL><LI> maintain ownership of their items
</LI><LI> Profit in the long-term from past iGEM participants continuing to use their products outside of the competition
</LI></UL><P>
iGEM:
</P><UL><LI> unlimited use of patented products
</LI><LI> can offset any potential licensing fee by providing advertising to the companies
</LI><LI> has the ability to share and standardise patented parts within the competition
</LI><LI> maintains its independence from outside interests
</LI></UL><P>
Although iGEM has remained a staunchly open-source arena for innovation in synthetic biology, we feel that the current trend in science to patent any promising discoveries will mean that iGEM and the intellectual property (IP) field will inevitably cross paths more and more often as time goes on. Consequently, immediate action should be taken to achieve the best possible outcome for participating iGEM teams, while also retaining iGEM’s independent, open source nature as much as possible. We have presented two possible solutions to this problem – the first allows iGEM to avoid any direct contact with IP holders, but means that the quality of the distribution kit and BioBrick library could be compromised over time. The second solution requires more direct negotiation with licence holders, but would hopefully result in a licencing agreement allowing iGEM to keep on largely as it has been run in the past. If iGEM does decide to confront this issue, the choice it makes will depend on the direction the competition, and indeed synthetic biology as a whole, wishes to take in the future. In this constantly adapting scientific landscape, it is important that iGEM is able to fit in amongst the framework established by industry and the academic world to facilitate discovery and innovation, which is at the centre of synthetic biology and the scientific discipline.
