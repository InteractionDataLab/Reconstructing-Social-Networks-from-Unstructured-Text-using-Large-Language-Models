Members attended a series of inductions including Physical Containment 2 <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(PC2)</A> training, Occupational Health &amp; Safety <A href="http://www.uq.edu.au/ohs/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(OHS)</A>, and separate inductions for each lab by respective lab managers.
Undergoing <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PC2</A> training allows us to work with Genetically Modified materials inside a <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PC2</A> lab, required for working with genetically modified organisms. Specific laboratory training was recorded in the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(OGTR)</A> folder.
This training was in conjunction to standard university online general induction training, annual fire safety training, and lab safety training. Student members were supervised in a lab environment when carrying out lab procedures or using lab equipments that required supervision, all with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as lab coat, gloves, closed shoes, and safety goggles; as indicated by material safety data sheets (MSDS) evaluated in risk assessments. 
</P><P>Any expected safety issues regarding public safety, have also been addressed prior to commencement of experimental work. To ensure the safety of the general public, no materials within the lab are exposed to the public or the environment. Transporting materials from one lab to another was done with the material in a double-sealed container.
No personnel without <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PC2</A> training were allowed in the lab. When disposing waste materials, biohazardous waste materials were disposed in the appropriate biohazard bin, likewise with sharps to ensure that general staff were not handling contaminated materials.
Should an incident occur where others are placed in danger, an incident report is filed and handled by relevant personnel.
</P><P>Any expected issues regarding environmental quality, have also been addressed prior to commencement experimental work.
To ensure environmental safety, Environmental Management System <A href="http://www.uq.edu.au/sustainability/policies-and-procedures" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(EMS)</A> induction was carried out, together with <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PC2</A> training. Imported goods are required to go through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service <A href="http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(AQIS)</A>. They have rules regulating what is allowed into the country to ensure that the environment is not 
harmed. Therefore, any biological materials that we received from overseas or planning to send to overseas (for our project) is abides by the rules of <A href="http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AQIS</A>.
</P><P>The security of the materials was maintained in the <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PC2</A> laboratory. The containment in the laboratory prevents untrained personnel from accessing materials. If we were to handle any Security Sensitive Biological Agents <A href="http://www.health.gov.au/SSBA" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(SSBAs)</A>, we would first consult the Biosafety Advisors at the University of Queensland.

Imported goods are required to go through <A href="http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AQIS</A> who regulate what is allowed into the country to ensure that the environment is not harmed. 
Documentation will be submitted to the Registry regarding the transportation of biological materials to and from Australia.

</P><P>There is an <A href="http://www.uq.edu.au/ohs/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">OHS</A> committee at the School of Biomedical Sciences (where we are based) to ensure the safety of the researchers, public, and the environment. This is comprised of Workplace Health and Safety officers (WHSOs), <A href="http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AQIS</A> representatives, Workplace Health and Safety Representatives (WHSR), Biosafety Advisors, and Work Injury Management Team.
</P><P>A discussion with the WHSOs resulted in the training of students. The students received <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/PC2-4/$FILE/PC2LABv3-1-1.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">PC2</A> training, <A href="http://www.uq.edu.au/ohs/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">OHS</A> and <A href="http://www.uq.edu.au/sustainability/policies-and-procedures" class="external text" rel="nofollow">EMS</A> induction and completed the online general safety, fire and laboratory training as well as laboratory specific training from the lab manager.
</P><P>In Australia, the <A href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00539" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gene Technology Act</A> is national set of guidelines regulated by the <A href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">OGTR</A>. <A href="http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis" class="external text" rel="nofollow">AQIS</A> regulates the transportation of materials in and out of the country.

Australia has its own set of regulations. We have informed iGEM of these regulations specific to Australia and anticipate that this information would update the iGEM safety information accessible to other teams.
