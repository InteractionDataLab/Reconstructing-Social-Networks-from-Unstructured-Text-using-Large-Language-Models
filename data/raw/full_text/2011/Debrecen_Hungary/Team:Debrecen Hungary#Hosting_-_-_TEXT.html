Hosting High School Students
Having seen the difference between a first-year and a second-year iGEM team, we felt exrtremely important to recruit new members to the group, to keep the project going. One side of this task was accomlished within the walls of our university by holding lectures and presentations about the iGEM-experience for students and inviting them to visit the lab and participate in the competition.
We also decided to recruit students at an even earlier peroid of their studies, so a lecture was put together and held at a local secondary school. During this presentation the basics of synthetic biology, the main features of the iGEM competition and some important results from our and some other groups were discussed. Students with a special interest in biology were at this meeting. Some of them took the opportunity and visited the group at the lab and one of them decided to join us and helped our work this year.
This year we got to know a smart, anthusiastic, helpful High School student called Éva, who became an indispensable member of the Team. She came not for only few weeks but for the whole summer, and gained experience which maybe pushes her toward biology studies.
Eva is preparing gel for agarose gel electrophoresis.
