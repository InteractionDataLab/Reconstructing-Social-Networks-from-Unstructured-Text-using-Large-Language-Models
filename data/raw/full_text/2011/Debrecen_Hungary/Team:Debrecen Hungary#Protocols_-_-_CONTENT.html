Our Student team members had to learn how to write useful notes and handle the notes when that was necessary. One of our instructors, Bálint László Bálint shared his own rules on Lab notebook writing to teach us precisity and accuracy. I must say that his guide was very profitable to all of us.
</P><P>The notebooks were classical paper-based so as to use when and where we needed, although we are considering to write online notebooks next year.
</P><P>If you have questions about how we proceeded this summer, choose and get in touch with the appropriate team member from the following list:

Pipettes, solutions, gels, electrodes, dishes and other scary machinery quickly filled our lives. From day one we saw the vast importance of teaching our students to keep a proper laboratory journal. We optimized and adjusted the protocols we used during the summer, and we would like to share them to the public. Last year we have made short films of our protocols and also shared the protocols in a text form on Open Wet Ware. With this section you can see into our daily work. For detailed protocols, see below.
</P><P>Video protocols were created by last year's team members. Some of them are different from this year's, but can be useful for those who have less experience in the methodology of molecular biology.

Bacterial cells into which foreign DNA can be transformed are called competent. Some bacteria are naturally competent (e.g B. subtilis), whereas others such as E. coli are not naturally competent. Non-competent cells can be made competent and then transformed via one of two main approaches; chemical transformation and electroporation (our lab tends to use a protocol based on treatment with calcium-chloride-pipes-glicerol solution). We tried several protocols last year, but we found that this is the best yielding among them.
This protocol may be particularly useful if you are finding that your transformations are not working or yiedling few colonies.

</LI><LI> centrifuge for 50 ml tubes with relative high performance
</LI></UL><P>
- <B>Notes</B></P><P>All purification steps should be carried out at room temperature.
All centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at &gt;12000 x g(10 000-14 000 rpm, depending on the rotor type).
Use 1-5 ml of E. coli culture in LB media for purification of high-copy plasmids.
For low-copy plasmids use up to 10 ml of culture.
</P><P>
- <B>Procedure</B></P><P>0. [small culture] Next day after transformation of the bacteria pick up a colony with a pipette tip from the agar plate, wash into 1-5 ml LB medium (with the proper antibiotic) and put the tube into a shaker to 37°C for 12 hours. After incubation, centrifuge the tube in a adequate centrifuge at 10000xg for 10 minutes. Pour off the used medium.
</P><P>1. Resuspend the pelleted cells in 250 μl of the Resuspension Solution. Transfer
the cell suspension to a microcentrifuge tube. The bacteria should be resuspended
completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
Note. Ensure RNase A has been added to the Resuspension Solution.
</P><P>2. Add 250 μl of the Lysis Solution and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube
4-6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
Note. Do not vortex to avoid shearing of chromosomal DNA. Do not incubate for more than 5
min to avoid denaturation of supercoiled plasmid DNA.
</P><P>3. Add 350 μl of the Neutralization Solution and mix immediately and thoroughly
by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Note. It is important to mix thoroughly and gently after the addition of the Neutralization Solution
to avoid localized precipitation of bacterial cell debris.
The neutralized bacterial lysate should become cloudy.
</P><P>4. Centrifuge for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.
5 Transfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET™ spin column by decanting or
pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white precipitate.
Step Procedure
</P><P>6. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the
same collection tube.
Note. Do not add bleach to the flow-through, see p.7 for Safety Information.
</P><P>7. Add 500 μl of the Wash Solution (diluted with ethanol prior to first use as
described on p.3) to the GeneJET™ spin column. Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and
discard the flow-through. Place the column back into the same collection tube.
</P><P>8. Repeat the wash procedure (step 7) using 500 μl of the Wash Solution.
</P><P>9. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual
Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.
</P><P>10. Transfer the GeneJET™ spin column into a fresh 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not
included). Add 50 μl of the Elution Buffer to the center of GeneJET™ spin column
membrane to elute the plasmid DNA. Take care not to contact the membrane with
the pipette tip. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature and centrifuge for 2 min.
Note. An additional elution step (optional) with Elution Buffer or water will recover residual DNA
from the membrane and increase the overall yield by 10-20%.
For elution of plasmids or cosmids &gt;20 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 70°C before applying to
silica membrane.
</P><P>11. Discard the column and store the purified plasmid DNA at -20°C.

</P><P>
- <B>Materials and notes</B></P><UL><LI> Sample: 50 ml E. coli culture, transformed with a high copy number plasmid. Harvest cultures at a density between 2.0 and 6.0 A600 units per ml bacterial culture.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Media: The isolation method is optimized for cultures grown in LB media; other rich media may require increased volumes of Suspension-, Lysis- and Neutralization Buffer, and an additional wash step
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Plasmid size: The isolation procedure is suitable for all plasmid sizes; lysates of larger constructs (up to 100 kb) should be cleared by filtration to avoid shearing
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Suspension Buffer/RNase A: To dissolve the lyophilized enzyme in Suspension Buffer, pipet 1 ml of Suspension Buffer (bottle 1, black cap) into the glass vial containing the lyophilized RNase (bottle 2, black cap). Reinsert the rubber stopper and invert the vial until all lyophilizate (including any that might stick to the rubber stopper) is dissolved. Transfer the dissolved enzyme back to the Suspension Buffer bottle (bottle 1). This is enough working solution for 60 Midi preps (isolation of up to 100 μg plasmid DNA/preparation)
</LI></UL><UL><LI> If preparing aliquots of the working solution, remember that the final concentration of RNase A in the working solution must be 100 g/ml. Reconstituted buffer is stable for 6 months is stored properly (+2 to +8°C)
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Neutralization Buffer: Before starting, cool it down to 4°C
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Elution Buffer: Before starting, warm up the buffer to 50°C
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Ethanol: Use 70% ethanol. Before starting, cool it down to 4°C
</LI></UL><P>
- <B>Procedure</B></P><P>1. Centrifuge bacterial cells from 30 ml culture grown in LB medium by centrifuging for 10 min at 5000 rpm,4°C.
Discard the supernatant. Carefully resuspend the pellet in 4 ml Suspension Buffer + RNase and mix well.
</P><P>2. Add 4 ml Lysis Buffer to the suspension and mix gently by inverting the tube 6 times. Incubate 2-3 min at room temperature. To avoid shearing genomic DNA, do not vortex the suspension in Lysis Buffer. To prevent release of chromosomal DNA from the cell debris, do not incubate for more than 5 minutes.
</P><P>3. Add 4 ml chilled Neutralization Buffer to the suspension. Immediately mix the suspension gently by inverting the tube 6 times until a homogenous suspension is formed. Incubate the tube 5 min on ice
The solution becomes cloudy and a flocculent precipitate will form.
</P><P>4. Clear the lysate by filtration. Put a folded filter into a funnel that has been inserted into a 50 ml plastic tube. Moisten the filter with a few drops of Equilibrium Buffer. Load the lysate onto the wet, folded filter and collect the flowthrough.
The SDS precipitates with cellular debris when Neutralisation Buffer is added; this white precipitate should not be loaded onto the column. If the solution obtained after step 14 is not clear, remove the remaining precipitate by passing the solution over a folded filter.</P><P>5. Mount the sealing ring to the column to fix the column in the collection tube. Insert one column into one collection tube. Equilibrate the column with 2,5 ml Equilibration Buffer. Allow the column to empty by gravity flow. Discard the flowthrough.
</P><P>6. Load the cleared lysate from step 4 onto the equilibrate column. Allow the column to empty by gravity flow. Discard the flowthrough.
</P><P>7. Wash the column with 5 ml Wash Buffer. Allow the column to empty by gravity flow. Discard the flowthrough.
</P><P>8. Repeat step 7 Discard flowthrough and collection tube.
</P><P>9. Re-insert the column into a new collection tube Elute the plasmid with 5 ml prewarmed Elution Buffer (50°C) Allow the column to empty by gravity flow The collection flowthrough contains the plasmid Elute the plasmid again with the flowthrough Allow the column to empty by gravity flow Plasmid concentration is higher, than after only one elution.
</P><P>10. Precipitate the eluted plasmid DNA with 3,6 ml isopropanol Total volume ~6,8 ml Divide the eluted plasmid into five 1,5 ml eppendorf tubes and one tube which contains 73 μl. Centrifuge immediately 30 min at 15000×g (rcf), +4°C. Carefully discard the supernatant.
</P><P>11. Divide the 6 tubes into two groups. Wash the plasmid DNA with 1,5 ml chilled (+4°C) 70% ethanol in the first tube and afterwards wash the other two with the same ethanol. Wash the other group (3 tubes) the same way.Centrifuge 10 min at 15000×g (rcf), +4°C. Carefully remove ethanol from the tube with pipet tip.Air-dry the plasmid DNA pellet for 10 min.
</P><P>12. Carefully redissolve the plasmid DNA pellet in 100-200 μl TE buffer. 
</P><P>13. Measure the concentration of DNA with NanoDrop.

These up/down stream segments contain restriction sites for specific restriction enzymes, which allows for the simple creation of larger BioBrick parts by chaining together smaller ones in any desired order.
</P><P>In the process of chaining biobrick parts together, the restriction sites between the two parts are removed, allowing the use of those restriction enzymes without breaking the new, larger BioBrick apart. To facilitate this assembly process, the BioBrick part itself should not contain any of these restriction sites.
</P><P>One such type of assemblies is the “three antibiotic” assembly standard. This assembly begins with a restriction step.
</P><P>
- <B>Overview</B></P><P>The following protocol contains detailed instructions on the restriction digestion step of the “three antibiotic” standard assembly. It starts with a medium amount of the two parts to be assembled and a medium quantity of the backbone that the parts will be assembled into. The result is a small amount of the insert part ready to be ligated into a linearized backbone.
</P><P>Note: This protocol uses NEB High Fidelity restriction enzymes and buffers.

The Medium
</P><P>Eukaryotic cells, derived from multicellular animal eukaryotes, can be maintained in culturing media. Aside from temperature and gas mixture, the most commonly varied factor in eucaryotic culture systems is the growth medium. Recipes for growth media can vary in pH, glucose concentration, growth factors, and the presence of other nutrients. The type of the medium used depends on the type of the cell line.
</P><P>II. PEI solution
</P><P>PEI (10 mM) is a cationic polymer used for PEI-mediated transfection.
</P><P>
- <B>Overview</B></P><P>I. The Medium
</P><P>For culturing cells and for ligand treatment we use DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) completed with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin-streptomycin and 2% L-Glutamine.
</P><P>For transfections we use DMEM medium without FBS, but other constitutives are included.
</P><P>The preparation procedure takes 40-50 minutes including the FBS melting time (stored in 50 ml aliquots at -20°C).
</P><P>

</P><P>
- <B>Scientific Background</B></P><P>FuGENE 6 transfection reagent is a multi-component lipid reagent that forms a complex with the DNA, then transports it into animal cells. FuGENE 6 transfection is used as standard method in many different laboratories due to its simple methodology, low cytotoxicity, and ability to provide high transfection efficiency even in the presence of serum.
Overview
</P><P>The transfection is divided into two main steps:
1. plating COS1 cells into glass cell culture vessel
2. the transfection itself
</P><P>The aim is to get cells of 50-80% confluency in the chosen vessel for the day of transfection.
</P><P>
- <B>Required materials</B></P><P>- COS1 cells in a T75 flask (regularly passaged, proliferating well - best in the log-growth phase)
- Trypsin/EDTA solution
- 1 x PBS solution
- 10% FBS containing DMEM medium
- LAB-TEK glass chamber slide with 8 chambers
- 15 ml centrifuge tube, tube holders
- Bürker chamber, pipettor, serological pipettes, pipettes, pipet tips, Pasteur pipettes
- sterile laminar air flow box, 37°C incubator, 37°C waterbath
- 70% ethanol, kimwipes
</P><P>
- <B>Procedure</B></P><P>I. <I>Plating</I></P><P>1. Prepare the sterile box: Open the sterile laminar box (Hood), turn on the ventillator and wait for 15 minutes to reach the optimal level of sterility (0,45 um filter). PUT ON YOUR GLOVES, wipe the box with 70% alcohol.
</P><P>
2. Prewarm the DMEM medium, Trypsin/EDTA and the 1x PBS in the 37°C waterbath (10-15 minutes)
</P><P>
3. Take the DMEM, Trypsin-EDTA and PBS and squirt the tubes and bottles with alcohol beforeyou put them in the sterile box. Put the pipettor and the tube holder into the box
(after you sprayed them down with 70% ethanol), and load the serlogical pipettes directly,without spraying down into the box.
</P><P>
4. Spray hands with ethanol. Remove the flask from the incubator and quickly place in hood. Fire-sterilize the neck of the
flask. (Do not spray flasks with ethanol).
</P><P>
5. Attach a Pasteur pipette to vacuum,turn on vacuum system by opening vacuum valve in hood. You should fire-sterilize the end of the pipette,after this step do not touch anything outside the flask. Aspirate the used medium from the cells by touching the bottom-side corner of the flask with the Pasteur-pipette.
</P><P>
6. Washing step:Add 2-3 mL of 1x PBS to flask by using pipettor and a serological pipette (Release the PBS onto the side of the flask, do not push the solution out directly onto the cells because they can come up easily). Lightly swirl PBS on base of the flask. Aspirate PBS from flasks by using a Pasteur pipette and vacuum.
</P><P>
7. Add 2 mL trypsin-EDTA to Flask. You can release the solution directly onto the cells, from now it does not matter if they come up. Lightly swish trypsin.
</P><P>
8. Place flask in 37°C incubator until detached (3-5 minutes for COS1 cells, depending on the temperature of the Trypsin- opt. temp: 37°C)
</P><P>
9. Remove cells from incubator. Tap side of the flask on hard surface of your hand. Repeat several times. Visually check to ensure lumps of cells are dispersed.
</P><P>
10. Check cells under phase-contrast microscope to confirm that cells are detached from the surface.
</P><P>
11. Put the falsk back to the sterile box, add 4 ml of 10% FBS containing DMEM medium to dilute trypsin (you can change the dilution level depending on the cell number, in order to be able to count the cells easier). Medium contains antitrypsin.(Note: The liquid suspension now contains the cells.)
</P><P>
12. Carefully resuspend cells by using pipettor and serological pipettes. You can repeat this step until you get individual floating cells (microscope check needed).Put the cells into a 50 ml tube, for easier handling.
</P><P>
13. Prepare the Bürker chamber and do a cell counting:
</P><P>
- Cell counting in a Bürker chamber:
</P><P>1) At first, clean the chamber with alcohol and water, put the thin glass slide onto the thicker slide,
compress them together by using the metal screw.
</P><P>2) Resuspend the cell suspension (for even distribution) in which you want to do the cell counting.
</P><P>3) Take 10 ul from the cell suspension (using sterile tip),
</P><P>inject into the chamber(marked with arrow) by touching the border of the two glasses with the pipet tip.
</P><P>4) Place the chamber under the phase-contrast microscope and try to find the lines.
</P><P>- count inside 3 big squares
</P><P>- then we take the average of the 3 big squares, and it will give us the number of the cells in 0,1 ul
we take it 10 in the factor of 4 times and it will give us the cell number in 1 ml cell suspension.
</P><P>NOTE: Don't forget that the cell suspenson in the chamber is now not sterile,
don't put it back into the cell solution. Clean the chamber with alcohol and water.
</P><P>
1. To reach the appropriate confluency the day after plating, we put 50.000 cells into each well.
For an 8 well chamber, if we calculate with 12 wells (because the volume loss), we put into a 15 ml centrifuge tube:
- 50.000 x 12 = 600.000 cells [ in milliliter: counted cell number in 1 ml / 600.000 cells ]
- we fill the cell suspension up to 8 x 300 ul = 2, 5 ml with 10% FBS DMEM
(total volume of the wells are 300 ul)
</P><P>2. With a 1 ml pipette put 300 ul from this suspension into each well. Sometimes invert the cell suspension containing tube
(the cells decent). After you finished the plate, swirl it circularly.
</P><P>3. Incubate the cells for 1 day at 37°C, 5% CO2.
</P><P>
II. <I>FuGENE 6 transfection:</I></P><P>The goal is to introduce foreign plasmid DNA into the plated COS1 cells 24 hours after the plating.
</P><P>Materials required:
- Plated cells in a LAB-TEK 8 well glass chamber slide ( with 50-80% confluency)
- FBS/antibiotics/other additives Free DMEM medium
- Sterile FuGENE 6 transfection reagent in a tightly capped glass vial
- Plasmids on ice, in known concentrations: Beta-Gal (normalizer plasmid), Luciferase (tracer), Nuclear receptor, VDR- as
negative control, the plasmids are solved in sterile TE-buffer
- 1,5 ml sterile Eppendorf tube, pipettes and tips
- Sterile laminar air flow box, 37°C incubator, 37°C waterbath
- 70% ethanol squirt bottle, kimwipes
</P><P>
Steps:
</P><P>1. Prepare the sterile box: Open the sterile laminar box (Hood), turn on the ventillator and wait for 15 minutes to reach the optimal level of sterility (0,45 um filter). PUT ON YOUR GLOVES, spray down the base of the box with 70% ethanol, and wipe down with kimwipes.
</P><P>2. Spray down your hands, the DMEM medium, the glass Reagent vial and the pipettes and tips with 70% ethanol. Put these and the plasmids and the eppendorf tube into the sterile box.
</P><P>3. Transfection mix reconstitution:
</P><P>3.1 Invert the room temp. FuGEGE 6 Transfection Reagent glass vial 2-3 times to distribute the components.
3.2 Dilute the FuGENE reagent with Serume/antibiotics/other additives free DMEM medium – the order and manner of   addition is critical:
Label a 1,5 ml eppendorf tube.
Pipet 75 ul FBS/antibiotics/other additives Free DMEM into the eppendorf tube.
Pipet 6 ul FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent directly into the medium, without allowing contact between the plastic    wall and the undiluted reagent.
3.3 Vortex the mix for 1 second.
3.4 Incubate the mix for 5 minutes at room temperature.
3.5 Add 500 ng from each of the three plasmids (receptor, Luciferase, beta – Gal.) into the diluted FuGENE 6   transfection reagent.
3.6 Vortex the Transfection Reagent:Plasmid mixture for 1 second.
3.7 Incubate the mixture for 20 minutes at room temperature.
</P><P>4. Remove glass chamber slide with plated cells from the incubator, place in the sterile box without spraying down with ethanol.
</P><P>5. Note: We don’t need to remove the culturing medium (10% FBS containing DMEM) from the cells, it does not have any effect on
the transfection efficiency.
Add 9 ul Transfection mix in a dropwise manner to each well. Swirl the chamber slide to ensure distribution over the entire surface.
</P><P>6. Put on the cap of the slide chamber. Return the cells to the 37°C incubator until the assay for gene expression is to be
performed.
Note: it is not necessary to remove and replace the transfection mixture-containing medium with fresh medium until the assay, only if you used FBS Free medium during the whole experiment (to avoid the cell starvation).
</P><P>7. Clean up after yourself, place the FuGENE reagent to +2 - +8 °C and be sure if the cap is tightly turned on the Reagent.
</P><P>
NOTES:
</P><P>- store the reagent at +2 - +8, with the lid very tightly closed, in the original glass vial.
- Do not allow the reagent to contact plastic walls (pipet directly into serum free medium) to keep the maximal biological activity.
- Do not use siliconized pipet tips and tubes.
- To prepare transfection complexes for larger experiments or parallel experiments, proportionally increase the quantity
according to the total surface area of the cell culture vessel being used. (ul FuGENE Reagent: ug DNA = 4:1, the used vessel in
this case has a 79,21 cm2 surface area)

The NR got into the cells through a previous transfection step. After treatment the ligand-binded NRs will dimerize and bind to the DNA at specific Nuclear receptor Response Elements and this will promote the gene expression of the downstream gene. In further examinations we detect the expression level of the target gene by Luciferase assay.
</P><P>- <B>Overview</B></P><P>The target cells in our case are COS1 cells. Performing the protocol from the beginning to the end takes no more than 1 hour, and the following steps are included:
</P><P>1. Preparation of the ligand solutions
</P><P>2. Removal of the transfection medium
</P><P>The goal is to get rid of the transfection medium from the COS1 cells 5-7 hours after transfection, because:
</P><P>- PEI can damage the cells
</P><P>- FBS Free medium used for transfection can cause starvation
</P><P>3. Cell refeeding with Ligand-containing medium
</P><P>Our aim is to refeed the cells with 10% FBS containing DMEM and also give appropriate amounts of Ligand in one step.
The 10% FBS in the medium will provide the necessary proteins and other molecules for proliferation and for life
functions. 
The ligand will activate the nuclear receptor and will promote gene expression.

- <B>Procedure</B></P><P>- in the case of 1-type receptor transfection (GAL4PPARg):
</P><P>We use different concentrations of ligand, so as to make a dose-response curve in the subsequent measuring process:

</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Measurement_of_Luciferase_reporter"><B>Measurement of Luciferase reporter</B></SPAN></H1><P>- <B>Scientific Background</B></P><P>Luciferase assay / cotransfection assay is a laboratory technique used by our team to measure the expression of the reporter firefly luciferase enzyme in order to study the effect of nuclear receptors/zinc fingers in different conditions. Luciferase substrate is transformed and emits light that can be measured (directly proportional to the expression of the enzyme and hence to the upregulation by Nuclear receptors/zinc fingers. The luciferase assay system is an extremely sensitive and rapid method. Linear results are seen over at least eight orders of magnitude of enzyme concentration. Generally, 100-fold greater sensitivity can be achieved over the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay.
</P><P>
- <B>Overview</B></P><P>After transfection with nuclear receptors and/or zinc fingers and ligand treatment we measure the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter (MH-100) which has a response element to a specific receptor upstream the protein coding sequence.

- <B>Procedure</B></P><P>I. <I>Sample preparation</I></P><P>1. 2 days after ligand treatment the used medium on the cells has to be discarded (Pasteur pipettes and vacuum).
2. Wash the cells with PBS (150 ul/well), discard with pasteur pipette and vacuum.
3. Wash again with 150 ul 1xPBS.
4. Add 200 ul lysis buffer to the washed cells
5. Put the plate on a plate shaker for 2 hours (chemical lysis)
6. Place the plate to -70°C for 30 minutes (physical lysis)
7. Divide the lysed cells into 2 plates, these will be the plates for beta-Gal measurement (for normalisation) and for luciferase activity measurement.
</P><P>– Measurement of β-GAL:
</P><P>1. Put 80 ul lysate from each well to the transparent β-GAL measurement plate.
2. Put 100 ul Luciferase substrate to the cells.
3. Wait for 3-5 minutes and the wells will become visibly yellow.

It is used extensively in fluorescence microscopy. DAPI can pass through an intact cell membrane therefore it can be used to stain both live and fixed cells, though it passes through the membrane less efficiently in live cells and therefore the effectiveness of the stain is lower.
</P><P>When bound to double-stranded DNA DAPI has an absorption maximum at a wavelength of 358 nm (ultraviolet) and its emission maximum is at 461 nm (blue). Therefore for fluorescence microscopy DAPI is excited with ultraviolet light and is detected through a blue/cyan filter. The emission peak is fairly broad DAPI will also bind to RNA, though it is not as strongly fluorescent. Its emission shifts to around 500 nm when bound to RNA.
</P><P>- <B>Overwiew</B></P><P>In order to vizualize the nuclear morphology of living and dying cells the nucleus of the cells were stained with DAPI which intercalates to the double stranded DNA. Nuclear fragmentation can be seen in the apoptotic cells.
</P><P>- <B>Procedure</B></P><P>1. Washing cells which are attached to the surface of the plate with PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature.
</P><P>2. Fixating cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes on ice.
</P><P>3. Washing cells which are attached to the surface of the plate with PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. Fixed cells can be stored at 4 C.
</P><P>4. Stain cells with DAPI in a concentration of 1 ng/ml for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
</P><P>5. Washing cells which are attached to the surface of the plate with PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature.
</P><P>6. Vizualizing the cells by fluorescent microscopy.
