Contributions to the project
All experiments were performed by our registered team members, and we all take responsibility for the contents of our wiki page and the parts uploaded by us to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. For detailed contributions see the list below.
Contributions member by member:
Students (in alphabetical order)
Tímea Beregi: cloning, transfections, wiki writing.
Éva Bernadett Bényei: Our young high school student took part in cloning, bacterial and tissue culture works, and helped us to survive evenings in Lab by her stories and games during incubation times.
Beáta Boros-Oláh: She participated in all lab works including cloning, bacterial works, tissue culture works, Luciferase/cotransfection assays, and also worked on uploading matter to the wiki. Making photos of labwork.
Lilla Ozgyin: Cloning and tissue culture works, transfections, luciferase assays and writing matter to the Registry and coordinating the wiki mission. Protocol writing, arsenic biosensor testing, extraction of contaminated environmental samples.
Petra Sepsi: Our enthusiastic team member took part in every cloning, bacterial and tissue culture works, luciferase assays and she uploaded materials to the wiki. Making photos on labwork.
Ildikó Tándor: She helped us in every possible way, including cloning, bacterial and cell culture works, luciferase assays and wiki writing. Uploading materials to the Registry.
Advisors (in alphabetical order)
Péter Brázda: He supervised planning and evaluation of luciferase assays, participated in wet-lab education and the wiki-works. Mentored our high school student to get acquainted with the concept of synthetic biology. He also gave us useful advices on the implementation of processes in which the students had some difficulties.
Gergely Nagy: Gergely was a real advisor by giving us a dozen of tips on labwork, and thought us the scientific way of thinking. He gave us help in the implementation of results and directed us towards critical way of thinking with his fancy imagination as well.
Katalin Sándor: She was the mentor of our new students in the first few weeks, helping them to get to be in practice with basic laboratory methods, and she passed her experiences by giving presentations to us.
Instructors (in alphabetical order)
Bálint L. Bálint M.D. Ph.D.: He was our main coordinator by initiating the project, he made the team recruitment, fund raising, some of the PR and laboratory setup. He supervised the first lab experiments and planned some of the experiments later on, ordered parts and reagents, organized finances. He supervised wiki and partsregistry work as well. He dealed with fundraising.
Bence Dániel: He was a supervisor of the whole labwork, he gave us new directions when the lab work stucked by unexpected reasons. He shared his huge experience of nuclear receptors, trained our new students and helped us with the cotransfection assays. He also worked on the wiki project and uploaded materials to the registry. He performed the sequencing of our new parts.
Endre Károly Kristóf M.D.: Endre helped us in the apoptosis project (as he is experienced in examining apoptosis) and in the training of new students during the summer. He also gave help in writing an article about the team, writing the abstract, uploading files to the Registry and our team wiki. Participating in fund raising, in silico design, video and media project. Uploading materials of project description to the wiki and informations about the composite and some basic parts to the partsregistry.
Gábor Zahuczky Ph.D.: He supported the initiation of the project, fund raising, organization of finances and administration. Participated in the design of parts and wet lab education.
