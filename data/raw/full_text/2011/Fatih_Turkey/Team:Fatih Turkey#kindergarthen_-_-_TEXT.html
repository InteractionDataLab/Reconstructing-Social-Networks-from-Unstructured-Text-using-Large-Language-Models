KINDERGARTHEN
Fatih_Turkey team visited a kindergarten to tell children what genetic                 engineering is!
Our one of the most important goals as a team Fatih_Turkey is to introduce iGEM                 and Synthetic                 Biology to the students in Turkey. But we did not want to limit ourselves                 by choosing only same age groups and we decided to tell the                 children, too. Synthetic biology has been told them by consultating         with several pre-school institutions. Also         we told them that bacteria do not cause only diseases ,in fact, they can also do good         things for people. For         example; they can heal the wound or they can produce light. Then, we asked                   what                   their bacteria can do for them. We want them to show their ideas by painting. They are                   only 6-age individuals but they have a lot of      original idea that can be seen by looking their paintings.
For instance;
* Bacteria that extends the hair 8 cm in 3 minutes',
* Bacteria massagers under the bed',
* Singer bacteria etc.
Consequently, we have told children that bacteria are not too harmful creatures.       In fact, sometimes, they would be very useful for people. This experience was a wonderful remembrance for us.
