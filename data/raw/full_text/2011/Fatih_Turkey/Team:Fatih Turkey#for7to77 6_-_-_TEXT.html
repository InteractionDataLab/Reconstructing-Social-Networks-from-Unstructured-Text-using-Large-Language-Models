SURVEY
To measure whether our human practices are  effective, we decided to prepare a survey for high school teenagers and  undergraduate students. Survey had 8 simple and clear statements about SynBio,  labs and devices in the lab and iGEM. We handed out surveys after our human  practices took place, especially after presentations in high schools.
The statements we asked were as follow:
I know what synthetic biology  is.
I learnt what BioBrick is.
I know what plasmid does.
I learnt what restriction  enzymes do.
I learnt the devices and tools  in the lab.
I enjoyed the game.
I learnt why antibiotics are  used.
I found the game educative
According to our results, our human  practices were very educative and enjoyable. About 75% of students states that  they learnt what SynBio is. This shows how effective our presentations and  other human practices we did. Despite of the lack of knowledge of student,  their complexity and relation to terminology; about 58% of responders say that  they learnt what plasmid does and 64% of them admit that they learnt what  restriction enzymes do. This indicates our language in our human practices and  presentations is quite understanding and clear.
For the survey results of our game, all of  the feedbacks are positive and supports our activities. Especially, 92% of the  responders states that our game is very educative and 87% of them found our  game enjoyable. This supports our opinion about our game: “Learning while  having fun is possible with the Canvas Time Game.”
