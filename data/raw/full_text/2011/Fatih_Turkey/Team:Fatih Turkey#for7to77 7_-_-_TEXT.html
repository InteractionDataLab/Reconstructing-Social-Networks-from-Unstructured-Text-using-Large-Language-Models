VISITORS OF LAB
During the planning of  our experiments, we had some visitors from other universities throughout  Turkey, whom were curious about our lab in which our works taking place. There  were undergraduate students from Hacettepe University Medical School and  postgraduate students from Ankara University Medical School. We told them what  iGEM competitions and synthetic biology were, what we were studying in our lab.  We also talked about our project and its future aspects. Finally, we encouraged  them to participate in the iGEM competition and recommended studying on  genetics and synthetic biology.
