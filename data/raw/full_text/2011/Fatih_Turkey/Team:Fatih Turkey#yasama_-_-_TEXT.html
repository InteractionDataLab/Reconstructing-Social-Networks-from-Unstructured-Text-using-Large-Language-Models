YASAMA SANATI
Beyond the lab works, we also strove for the innovation and presentation of synthetic biology to people.  As a medical school, our hospital has its own quarterly magazine, “Yasama  Sanati” (in English: The Art of Living).  We decided that we could mention about iGEM and synthetic biology; thus we  wrote an article that told the bacteria is not too much harmful living creature to  humans as it is seen nowadays. In fact, we mentioned that bacteria would become  very handy, helpful and inteligent “machines” in appropiate conditions. We  listed the former experiments and parts that took place in iGEM competition and  gave some examples about what to do next.
We also talked about iGEM  competition and its international character. In the article attending of 130  teams throughout the world, seperation of competition to stages by continents  and the teams from Turkey attending to iGEM were mentioned. The article took  place in the magazine published on July- August- September 2011.  Considering its innovation and presentation  for synthetic biology and iGEM competition, we found this work too important.
