Playing Game
Canvas Town game can be played with your friends, your labmates and with other iGEM teams as a competition.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Despite the struggle of all players in Canvas Town Game, they are still good friends... From right to left, B.subtilis, Virus and E.coli...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players (Virus,B.subtilis,E.coli) are ready to go through dangerous ways of Canvas Town.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After character cards distributed to players, our team member Fazilet laughes the situation of other player, whom has disadvantages.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virus team in the game, Mustafa and Fazilet shares their distinct cards in the same box during the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virus team is relaxing in Alcohol sterilized box because viruses can withstand.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After rolling the dice, E.coli goes forward.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alperen, other E.coli player, laughes; but his E.coli team's situation is very bad; because both of Cihan and Alperen are at START point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Situation of Cihan in the game is bad since E.coli is again and again killed in Autoclav box.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mustafa comes to Gene Synthesizer box and selects new card from Gene synthesis cards.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.coli and B.subtilis are still at the START position in spite of several cycles of rolling dice.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Mustafa, virus player, comes to UV box and its DNA is disrupted. Thus, goes START point.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very thoughtful time, the players think their destiny in Canvas Town. `To be or not to be, that's the point!`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Top view of all Fatih Turkey team while playing the game. What an exciting game!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ozan, B.subtilis player, rolls dice! Rolling to dead:)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tulin, B.subtilis player, is laughing because she is again killed in kanamycin box due to absence of the resistance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again and again... Cihan, E.coli player, is in START box even at the end of  tens of cycle. Very unlucky person...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good time for Cihan; because he goes three steps forward.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ozan is very happy like reaching to Nirvana! Because he is still alive and close to END.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking from the edge of Convas Town Box, in which players can go forward if they have TAKE A PHOTO character card.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oooo! B.subtilis comes to Pst1 restriction site box, here if any player has a Pst1 site on its genome, then it is killed and returned to near checkpoint... Or if the player has Pst1 sites on the character plasmids, then the player losts the character card.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virus and E.coli are at Fatih_Turkey Lab Box;that is, they are too close to final box `iGEM` after passing Holland Box...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Canvas Town Game has been designed like that any person can play and learn very useful information about organisms, techniques and devices used mostly in a synthetic biology lab and about iGEM interesting Biobrick parts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The winner in our game was Virus team by reaching to the END first. E.coli and B.subtilis shares second and third positions according to their situations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Canvas Town game, when players come to Gene Synthesizer Box, then they can take a card from Gene synthesis place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can give Canvas Town Game set to your friends, families and people in your city, especially students from primary school to high school and even in universities.
