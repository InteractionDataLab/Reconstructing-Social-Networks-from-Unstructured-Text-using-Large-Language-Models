Synthetic Biology Meeting Turkey
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TURKEY MEETING 
Synthetic Biology Turkey meetings 1.0 of iGEM      Turkey teams were organized by Association of Synthetic Biology and      METU-Ankara Team on September 10, 2011 and we were also invited to the      meeting organization, we were glad to be a part of this meeting. The      organization’s aim was to arrange meeting with all Turkey iGEM team members      and researchers and related companies in order to discuss Synthetic biology      in Turkey and the iGEM competition potential on ongoing studies. In this      meeting, all iGEM teams and Bio- entrepreneurship company owners presented      their presentations and some foreign academics talked about synthetic      biology giving some helpful advice to listeners via teleconference system.      It was very informative and enjoyable for us. We presented a successful      presentation which was about our project and played our Canwas Town Game      with other iGEM Turkey teams. Also one of the important news informants of      Turkey which is Anadolu Agency came to this meeting and talked with Turkish      teams’ members and took some photos.
