Inhibition  in Liquid Culture Assay
We wanted to see the effects of supernatant of B.subtilis which produces LALF  in order to stop growth of E.coli with RFP in liquid culture.
We added 8 ml LB broth in falcons and determined 3 control groups. These were:
Control group 1: Includes only 5 ul E.coli which waited for 12 hours in 37⁰C. These can synthesize RFP.
Control group 2: Includes only 5 ul B.subtilis which produces LALF. They  waited for 12 hours in 37⁰C.
Control group 3: Includes only 5 ul B.subtilis which do not produce LALF.  They waited for 12 hours in 37⁰C.
First of all, we  put 5 ul E.coli which has RFP into 8 falcons as experimental groups. We waited  experimental falcons for 12 hours in 37⁰C. Then, we added 1 ul, 10 ul, 100 ul and 1000 ul  liquid culture with LALF and liquid culture without LALF. After this, we  incubated them in 37⁰C and measured their OD value after 2 - 4 - 8 - 12 hours in 405 nm. You can  see the results below:
