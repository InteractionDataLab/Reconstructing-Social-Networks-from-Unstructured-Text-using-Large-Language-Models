CANVAS TIMES
We have prepared a journal which is named  “Canvas Times”. It gives you the actual news of iGEM competition, our lab and  team as well as other iGEMers and their projects. Also, you can learn about our  project and read our columnist, too.
During our lab working, we could find some  time to have fun and talk with other people about our project, synthetic  biology and iGEM. All of our activities and human practices are existed in our  journal such as “Fatih Turkey at Kindergarten” and “International Medical  Students Conference. Therewithal, you will find some information of our  university and faculty. You can find all of the stores. This journal is an easy  way to reach out more people that has been very useful during our human  practices.
