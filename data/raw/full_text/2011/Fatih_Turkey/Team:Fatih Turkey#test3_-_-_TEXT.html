SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY TURKEY MEETING
Synthetic Biology Turkey meetings 1.0 of iGEM Turkey teams were organized by Association of Synthetic Biology and METU-Ankara Team in September 10, 2011 and we invited to the meeting organization, we were be glad to being a part of this meet up. The organization’s aim was to arrange meeting with all Turkey iGEM team members and researchers and related companies in order to discuss the Synthetic biology in Turkey and the iGEM competition potential on ongoing studies. In this case, all of iGEM teams and Bio- entrepreneurship company owners presented their presentations also some foreign academics talked about synthetic biology and gave some helpful advices to listeners with helping the teleconferences. It was very informed for us also very enjoyed. We presented a succesful presentation which is about our project and played our Canwas Town Game with other iGEM Turkey teams. Also one of the important news informants of Turkey which is Anadolu Agency came to this meet up and talked with Turkey teams’ members and took some photos.
 
Yasama Sanati (In english: The Art of Living)
                                                                                                                                July 2011
Beyond the lab works, we also strove for the innovation and presentation of synthetic biology to people.  As a medical school, our hospital has its own quarterly magazine, “Yasama  Sanati” (in English: The Art of Living).  We decided that we could mention about iGEM and synthetic biology; thus we wrote an article that told the bacteria is not too much harmful living creature to  humans as it is seen nowadays. In fact, we mentioned that bacteria would become  very handy, helpful and inteligent “machines” in appropiate conditions. We  listed the former experiments and parts that took place in iGEM competition and  gave some examples about what to do next.
We also talked about iGEM  competition and its international character. In the article attending of 130  teams throughout the world, seperation of competition to stages by continents  and the teams from Turkey attending to iGEM were mentioned. The article took  place in the magazine published on July- August- September 2011.  Considering its innovation and presentation  for synthetic biology and iGEM competition, we found this work too important.
We have got company!
                                                                                                                                July 2011
During  the  planning  of  our  experiments,  we had some  visitors  from  other  universities throughout Turkey, whom were curious about our lab in which our works taking place. There were undergraduate students from Hacettepe University Medical School and postgraduate students from Ankara University Medical School. We told them what iGEM competitions and synthetic biology were, what we were studying in our lab. We also talked about our project and its future aspects. Finally, we encouraged them to participate in the iGEM competition and recommended studying on genetics and synthetic biology. During  the  planning  of  our  experiments,  we had some  visitors  from  other  universities throughout
Gifted Children
                                                                                                                                July 2011
During our lab working we have hosted lots of visitors. Some of them are gifted children. Those children are studying in several schools of Ankara and they are some of the most intelligent children of Ankara. Their ages are 10-13 around and they were very interested with the genetic. We talked about our Project, synthetic biology and İGEM competition. Also, we played the Canvas Town Game and it was really funny.  In the game there was three groups which are B. Subtilis, E. Coli, virus and each group was have a leader who is member of our team. At the beginning of game there were three groups but at the end there was just one winner and virus group was the lucky group
Kindergarten
                                                                                                                                June 2011
Fatih_Turkey team visited a kindergarten to tell children what genetic                 engineering is!
Our one of the most important goals as a team Fatih_Turkey is to introduce iGEM                 and Synthetic                 Biology to the students in Turkey. But we did not want to limit ourselves                 by choosing only same age groups and we decided to tell the                 children, too.
Synthetic biology has been told them by consultating                     with several pre-school institutions. Also                     we told them that bacteria do not cause only diseases ,in fact, they can also do good                     things for people. For                     example; they can heal the wound or they can produce light.
Then, we asked                   what                   their bacteria can do for them. We want them to show their ideas by painting. They are                   only 6-age individuals but they have a lot of
original idea that can be seen by looking their paintings.
For instance;
* Bacteria that extends the hair 8 cm in 3 minutes',
* Bacteria massagers under the bed',
* Singer bacteria etc.
Consequently, we have told children that bacteria are not too harmful creatures
In fact, sometimes, they would be very useful for people. This experience was a wonderful remembrance for us.
 
What do you want from your  bacteria to do for you?
                                                                                               June 2011
Fatih_Turkey asked medical school students: "Assuming that you are an expert on synthetic biology, what would you want your bacteria to do for you?
Another activity that we did in Fatih University Medical School was the preparation of a poster that caused a new brainstrom through the prospective doctors.                 We mentioned iGEM competition and some experiments that took place in the competition in our poster. And we asked them what you want your bacteria do for you if you change their genome. We wanted them to                 write their opinions on the poster. And we decided                  surprise award for winner whom has given the best opinion.
Our colleagues                   have childish but originals ideas. They liked                   the activity, because it was done when exams were on going, so they had chance to breathe between exams by writing their ideas on the board. Surprisingly, general approach to the activity was the hero bacteria which would save them from the exams. Our colleagues wanted impossible                   things from their bacteria.                   such as;  'Either exist as you are, or be as you look.(M.J.Rumi)',
 'My bacteria come to school for me'  'My bacteria rewind time(it was told after                   exams=)',
 'My bacteria enter my brain to increase my  brain activity to 100%.'
 'My bacteria oversee for me (how poor assistant)' etc.
Of course  all ideas were not the case:
Bacteria would adhere to cell membrane and regulate to nutritional value.
Bacteria would produce to water because few years later the world will be completely desert.
Bacteria would repair to ozone layer.
Bacteria would grind the rubbish.
People  whom have interests about iGEM and synthetic biolgy, have also been thankful for the poster.
International  Medical Student Conference
                                                                                                                                April 2011
At 2011, we as Fatih_Turkey (Medical School Wetlab Team)  started iGEM Human Practices by performing presentation about syntehtic biology on world and in Turkey. We have performed Second International Medical  Student Conference in Ankara. In the conference, synthetic biology and iGEM  competition related presentation was performed to inform medical school  students coming from different medical schools in Turkey and also from out of  Turkey ie. Japan.
Burak Yilmaz, CEO of Sentegen, as our sponsor mentioned in his talk the discovery of DNA, synthetic biology, International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) competition and teams from Turkey taking place in the competition.
Medical school students coming to our conference were informed about synthe
