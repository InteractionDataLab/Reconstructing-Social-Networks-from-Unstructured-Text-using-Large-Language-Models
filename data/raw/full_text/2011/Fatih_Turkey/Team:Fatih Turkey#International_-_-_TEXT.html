INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL STUDENT CONFERENCE
At 2011, we as Fatih Turkey (Medical School Wetlab Team)  start to iGEM by performing presentation about Syntehtic Biology on world and  at Turkey for Human Practice. We have performed Second International Medical  Student Conference at Ankara. In the Conference, Synthetic Biology and iGEM  competition related presentation was performed to inform medical school  students coming from different medical schools at Turkey and also from out of  Turkey ie. Japan.
Burak Yilmaz, CEO of Sentegen, as our sponsor has started  his talk from discovery of DNA to Synthetic Biology, from this concept to  International Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) and from iGEM  to iGEM teams at Turkey.
Medical Students coming to our conference have been informed  about Synthetic Biology Concept which consists of the design and construction  of new biological parts, devices and systems, and the re-design of existing,  natural biological systems for useful purposes such as genetically engineered  medical projects like Fast Wound Healing Project performed by METU-Gene Team at  iGEM 2009. 
Especially, the students were excited when we mentioned the  synthetic biology projects like engineered bacteria having the ability to find  and kill tumor cells. In addition, we gave also examples from the paper 'The  impact of synthetic biology on drug   discovery' conducted by Martin Fussenegger and Wilfried Weber. From the  paper, synthetic biology phenonmenon was mentioned in the conference in order  to be used in medical schools to enable disease mechanisms and target  identification to be alucidated and also provide avenues to discover small  chemotherapeutic molecules or design novel biopharmaceuticals.
Next, we began to talk about the widest synthetic biology  competition -iGEM-. We said to our friends from different medical schools that  gene parts named as Biobricks distributed to all iGEM teams in plates are used  to perform functional and useful projects in an organism by the teams,  especially in E.coli, during an enjoyable summer lab working. Different  biobricks, their certain functions and how they are assembled were told in the  talk.   
Finally, we introduced five iGEM teams from Turkey, 2  of them are software teams while remaining are wetlab teams. We said that we  will participate in the semi-final at Holland as Europe as Fatih Turkey, METU  Ankara, Bilkent UNAM as wetlab teams and METU Turkey Softlab and METU BIN  Ankara as software teams.
