OPINIONS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS
Fatih_Turkey asked medical  school students whether they were experts on synthetic biology and what they  wanted from their bacteria to do for themselves.
Another activity we did was in Fatih Medical School; firstly we prepared  a poster, then we hanged it to our campus. We introduced the İGEM competition  and some good bacteria in our poster. And we asked our fellow students “What do  your bacteria do for you if you change their genome?” And we wanted them to  write their opinions on the poster. And we decided a surprise award for the  winner with the best opinion.
Our  fellow students had very original ideas, like the children in the kindergartens  we visited. They liked the activity because it was done during the exam time so  it helped reduce the stress of the students.    Surprisingly, general approach was giving  childish ideas about designing the bacteria. However, there were very good  ideas, too; such as:
- Bacteria would adhere to cell membrane and regulate to nutritional value.
- Bacteria would produce to water because few years later the world will be  completely desert.
- Bacteria would repair to ozone layer.
- Bacteria would grind the rubbish.
People, whom have interests about iGEM and synthetic  biology, have also been thankful for the poster.
