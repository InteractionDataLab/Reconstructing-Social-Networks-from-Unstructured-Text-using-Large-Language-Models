CHARACTERIZATION
Before starting assays; we needed to be sure that our genes had been cloned  correctly. In order to use our parts in our experiments, we confirmed our parts  via electrophoresis. Following parts are fully confirmed:
Subparts
Parts
BBa_K541501
BBa_K541515
BBa_K541502
BBa_K541545
BBa_K541503
BBa_K541596
BBa_K541504
BBa_K541915
BBa_K541505
BBa_K541800
BBa_K541506
BBa_K541516
 
BBa_K541526
 
BBa_K541546
After electrophoresis results; we furthermore performed sequencing and  imaging tests to characterize our BioBricks. For BBa_541505 and BBa_541506; we  added a GFP sequence and transformated into E.coli. This has characterized our  main proteins. cDNA sequencing for these parts was also done successfully.
In addition, BBa_541800 is transformated into B.subtilis and successfully  imaged red that shows RFP region and therefore plasmid backbone works properly.
We characterized BBa_K541545, BBa_K541515 and BBa_K541915 via sequencing.
