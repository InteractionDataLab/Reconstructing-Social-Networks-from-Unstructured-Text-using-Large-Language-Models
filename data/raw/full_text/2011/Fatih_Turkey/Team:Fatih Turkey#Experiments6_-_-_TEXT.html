Existence of Reflectin
Reflectin  Existence Assay
We transfered the plasmid which includes the gene part of reflectin protein  (BBa_K541596) to E. Coli and we saw that there is a difference between  reflectin including colonies and the control group.
We saw that the plate which does not include reflectin protein is normally  transparent. But the plate with the reflectin synthesizing bacteria seemed  white. This makes us think that our plasmid is working and the protein is  produced by E. coli.
Additionally,  the colonies are looked through light microscope. The colony which was supposed  to produce reflectin had some transparent points. In contrast, the control  group had completely different image. We think that reflectin protein caused  these points; thus reflectin might be synthesized. However, we did not image  the effect of reflectin; so, we do not know whether reflectin works as it is  expected.
