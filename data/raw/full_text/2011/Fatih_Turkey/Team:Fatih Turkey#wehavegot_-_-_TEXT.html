WE HAVE GOT COMPANY
During  the  planning  of  our  experiments,  we had some  visitors  from  other  universities throughout Turkey, whom were curious about our lab in which our works taking place. There were undergraduate students from Hacettepe University Medical School and postgraduate students from Ankara University Medical School. We told them what iGEM competitions and synthetic biology were, what we were studying in our lab. We also talked about our project and its future aspects. Finally, we encouraged them to participate in the iGEM competition and recommended studying on genetics and synthetic biology.
