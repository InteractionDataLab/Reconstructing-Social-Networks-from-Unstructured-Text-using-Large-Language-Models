Synthetic Biology Meeting Turkey
INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL STUDENT CONFERENCE 
In 2011, we, as Fatih_Turkey (Medical School Wetlab    Team) started “iGEM” by performing a presentation about Syntehtic Biology in    the world and in Turkey for Human Practice. We have arranged the Second    International Medical Student Conference in Ankara. In the conference, papers    related to Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition was presented    to inform medical school students coming from different medical schools in    and out of Turkey (e.g. Japan).
Burak Yilmaz, CEO of Sentegen, as our sponsor mentioned in his talk a wide    range of topics from discovery of DNA to Synthetic Biology, International    Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) and iGEM teams in Turkey.
Medical Students coming to our conference were informed about Synthetic    Biology Concept which consists of the design and construction of new    biological parts, devices and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural    biological systems for useful purposes such as genetically engineered medical    projects like Fast Wound Healing Project performed by METU-Gene Team at iGEM    2009. 
Especially, the students were excited when we mentioned the synthetic biology    projects like engineered bacteria having the ability to find and kill tumor    cells. In addition, we gave examples from the paper 'The impact of synthetic    biology on drug discovery published by Martin Fussenegger and Wilfried    Weber. From the paper, synthetic biology phenomenon was mentioned in the    conference in order to be used in medical schools to enable disease mechanisms    and target identification to be elucidated and also provide avenues to    discover small chemotherapeutic molecules or design novel biopharmaceuticals.
Next, we began to talk about the widest synthetic biology competition, iGEM.    We said to our friends from different medical schools that gene parts named    as Biobricks distributed to all iGEM teams in plates are used to perform    functional and useful projects in an organism by the teams, especially in    E.coli, during enjoyable summer lab studies. Different BioBricks, their    certain functions and how they are assembled were told in the    talk.   
Finally, we introduced five iGEM teams from Turkey, 2 of them are software    teams while the remaining are wetlab teams. We said that we would participate    in the European semi-final in Holland as Fatih_Turkey, METU Ankara, Bilkent    UNAM as wetlab teams and METU Turkey Softlab and METU BIN Ankara as software    teams.
