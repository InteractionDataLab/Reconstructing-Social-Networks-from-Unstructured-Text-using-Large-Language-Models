Biofilm
Bacteria are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilm. In biofilm, cells grow in multicellular aggregates that are encased in an extracellular matrix produced by the bacteria themselves (1). The extracellular polymeric matrix is an important structural component of biofilm and it plays an important role in the attachment and colonization of microorganisms on a surface also acts as a diffusion barrier to small molecules. Related to this, in biofilm the diffusion of nutrients, vitamins, or cofactors is slower resulting in a bacterial community in which some of cells are metabolically inactive. (2). Bacillus subtilis forms biofilm whose constituent cells are held together by the extracellular matrix and one of the main matrix competent is the protein TasA which is a form of amyloid fibers and binds cells together in the biofilm (3). The matrix, which is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and water, enables the biofilm to attach to the surfaces. One of the most important functions of the matrix is to protect the bacteria from various stress and factors such as UV radiation, extreme pH values, osmotic pressure, dehydration and antibiotics(4).

QUORUM SENSING
In the biofilm formation bacteria can talk each other via some signal mechanisms. And those mechanisms are called “quorum sensing”.
Quorum or diffusion responses in bacteria are mediated by secreted signalling molecules that accumulate extracellularly as cultures grow to high density. The regulatory response to these signalling molecules can result in dramatic changes in gene expression. In Bacillus subtilis, a quorum response is mediated by a secreted 10-amino-acid modified peptide (ComX pheromone) that activates a receptor histidine kinase (ComP) that activates a response regulator transcription factor (ComA).  ComA directly activates the srfA operon which encodes enzymes needed for the production of the lipopeptide surfactin.(5)
In Bacillus subtilis, quorum responses contribute to the induction of competence development, sporulation, degradative enzyme production and antibiotic production (6). The ComX–ComP–ComA signalling pathway is a major quorum response pathway in B. Subtilis and regulates the development of genetic competence (7).
During biofilm formation in B. subtilis, most cells produce and secrete ComX. A subset of these cells become surfactin producers and secrete surfactin and a distinct population that does not itself synthesize surfactin responds to this surfactin and generates the extracellular matrix.

FLAKY BIOFILM
In our project, our goal is to get an easily applied  anti- gram negative coat with the inhibition mechanism of our LALF protein. Normally,  agar does not have a vicious consistency; therefore, it cannot be easily  applied on a surface. For this reason; we perform a useful method which is  called biofilm paste (benefited from Team Groningen 2010). In this method, we  use corn starch with liquid lb medium. Our wild type B. subtilis grows up very  fast with the corn starch. We use 2 g corn starch with 50 ml LB medium. After 3  days waiting at 37 oC, we get our flaky biofilm.
