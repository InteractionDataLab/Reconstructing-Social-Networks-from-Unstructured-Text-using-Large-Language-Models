Synthetic Biology Meeting Turkey
GOVERNMENT FOR SYNBIO
In 26th October 2011, BIOTECH  Conference was held in Fatih University in İstanbul. The Minister of Science,  Industry and Technology of Turkey also visited the conference. As Fatih Turkey  team, we were there to perform a presentation about SynBio and iGEM. During our  visit, we had the chance to talk with minister about SynBio, iGEM and our  project. We mentioned about the importance of this study and the minister was very  interested in it. He appointed his General Principle for the development of  this field and also our project.
With this meeting, we succeed to lure the  interest of government of Turkey to SynBio. In a few years, with the increase  of numbers of Turkish iGEMers and projects in this field of study, assists of  government is supposed to increase, too. We find this work very important  considering the possible acceleration in the studies with support of  government.
