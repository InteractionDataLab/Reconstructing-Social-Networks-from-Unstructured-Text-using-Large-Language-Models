GIFTED CHILDREN
During our lab working we have hosted lots of visitors. Some of them are gifted children. Those children are studying in several schools of Ankara and they are some of the most intelligent children of Ankara. Their ages are 10-13 around and they were very interested with the genetic. We talked about our Project, synthetic biology and İGEM competition. Also, we played the Canvas Town Game and it was really funny.  In the game there was three groups which are B. Subtilis, E. Coli, virus and each group was have a leader who is member of our team. At the beginning of game there were three groups but at the end there was just one winner and virus group was the lucky group.
