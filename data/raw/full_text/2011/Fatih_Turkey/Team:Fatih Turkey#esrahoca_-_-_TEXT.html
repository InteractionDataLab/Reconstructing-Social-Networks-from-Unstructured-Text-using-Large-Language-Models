Hello everyone! My name is Esra. I’m an Associate Professor of Medical Genetics. This is my third year back in Turkey after staying twelve years in Japan. I mainly work on Cancer Genetics and more specifically on Tumor Suppressor Genes. I do enjoy being with my students and working with them together. iGEM competition has provided us to become closer. I think we share a lot scientifically, socially and friendly together with my students. I also like speaking Japanese and cooking.
