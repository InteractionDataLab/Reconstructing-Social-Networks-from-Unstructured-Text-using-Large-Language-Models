      We made like  MİC(minimum inhibitory concentration) experiment which is using been for  antibiotic because of finding minimum concentration of LALF  that get inhibition of growing e.coli.But we  didn’t added  sequence which help us in purifying  of protein like His-tag  which we were synthesising  LALF .So we used supernatant of B.subtilis which produced LALF instead of pure  LALF protein.
23.10.2011
We used  culture of  e. coli whose OD is 0,4 with  GFP.50 ul culture of e.coli and 3-50 ul supernatant of  B.subtilis with LALF and without LALF were  put into all wells.Lb with Chl  was added by completing total volume to 100  ul.
24.10.2011
We  used culture of e.coli whose OD is 0,4 with GFP .25 ul culture of e.coli  and 75 ul supernatant of B.subtilis with LALF  and without LALF were  put into all wells.Lb  with Chl  was added by completing total  volume to 100 ul.
25.10.2011
We  used culture of e.coli whose OD is 0,1 with GFP .25 ul culture of e.coli and 75  ul supernatant of B.subtilis with LALF and without LALF were  put into all wells.Lb with Chl  was added by completing total volume to 100  ul.
26.10.2011
We used  culture of e.coli whose OD is 0,2 with GFP .25 ul culture of e.coli  and 75 ul supernatant of B.subtilis with LALF  and without LALF were put into all wells. Lb with Chl  was added by completing total volume to 100  ul.
27.10.2011
The  experiment which was made for observing to supernatant of B.subtilis with LALF  effect on liquid culture of e.coli.
6 ml  LB with chl ,2ul e.coli which was growthed overnight ;10,100,1000,2000 ul  B.subtilis supernatant with LALF and without  LALF was added.
B.subtilis supernatant with  LALF  and  without LALF was completed to 2 ml  with Lb has chl.
Measure of OD was made at 0-2-4-6-8 hours in 600 and 405 nm.
29.10.2011 E.coli  with RFP was used.
1. We used  50ul e.coli culture whose OD came 0,1 with RFP and 50 ul LALF.
2. We used    25ul e.coli culture whose OD came 0,1 with RFP and 75ul LALF.
3.We  used  90ul e.coli culture whose OD came  0,1 with RFP and 10ul LALF.
4. We  used 25ul e.coli culture whose OD came 0,2 with RFP and 75 ul LALF.
5.  We used 10ul e.coli culture whose OD came 0,2 with RFP and 90 ul LALF.
6. We used 25ul e.coli culture whose OD came  0,3 with RFP and 75ul LALF.
7. We used   10ul e.coli culture whose OD came 0,3 with RFP and 90ul LALF.
8. We  used 10ul e.coli culture whose OD came 0,4 with RFP and 90ul LALF.
