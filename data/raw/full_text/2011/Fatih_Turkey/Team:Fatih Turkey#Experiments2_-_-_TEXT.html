THE SUICIDE EXPERIMENT OF E. COLI
Our K541545 part contains IPTG promoter and the gene  part of LALF protein on a backbone which has resistance to chloramphenicol. We  transported this part to E. coli for testing whether E. coli would stop its own  growth like a suicide.
Assays of plates with and without IPTG
Assay 1: We streaked E. coli culture which has BBa_K541545.  Media also included chloramphenicol and IPTG. As a control group, a plate that  has no IPTG is prepared. We aimed to see less colonies comparing with control  group.
Assay 2: This experiment was done in order to eliminate the  possibility of toxic effect of IPTG. E.coli without IPTG promoter was streaked  a plate that does not have IPTG. For a second plate, E.coli with PlacI promoter  was added into plate with IPTG.
