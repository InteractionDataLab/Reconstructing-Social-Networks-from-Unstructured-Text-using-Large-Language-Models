1.       Ten colonies that hadparts with promoter, RBS, signal sequence and our special genes were incubated in the ampicilin and chloramphenicol rich medium. The plates that had no colonies incubated were ours which we had expected.  These were 1001+1005+K/TNG, 1001+1005+K/HNG, J04500+1006+K/BT, J04500+1006+K/ST and J04500+1006+K/FG.
2.       Ten colonies were incubated in the ampicilin and chloramphenicol rich LB and five additional colonies were incubated in the only chloramphenicol rich medium in order to eliminate by observing if any colony would be seen or not. J04500+1006+K ST, 1001+1005+K TNG, 1001+1005+K HNG, J04500+1006+K FG, J04500+1006+K BT were not seen in the falcons. (These are confirmed.) However; 1001+1005+K MG, 1001+1005+K SNG, J04500+1006+K FT, J04500+1006+K AT, 1001+1005+K İG were not confirmed.
3.       Plasmid isolation was done for 1004+1005+K B, 1001+1006+K A, 1004+1006+K C, 1002+1005+K B and 1002+1005+K A.
4.       Glycerol stock was performed for 1004+1005+K B, 1001+1006+K A, 1004+1006+K C, 1002+1005+K B.
5.       1002+1005+K/1, 1002+1005+K/2, 1002+1005+K/3, 1002+1005+K/4 and 1002+1005+K/5 were put into LB medium for incubation and spread on the plates.
6.       Digestion-ligation was performed for shuttles. (except for 1002+1005+K/A)
7.       Electrophoresis was done for confirmation of J04500+1006+K BT, J04500+1006+K FT, J04500+1006+K ST, 1001+1005+K HNG, 1001+1005+K TNG, 1003+1006+K, k143053+1006+K and its shuttle. For all genes, gels were cut and stocked in +4 C.
