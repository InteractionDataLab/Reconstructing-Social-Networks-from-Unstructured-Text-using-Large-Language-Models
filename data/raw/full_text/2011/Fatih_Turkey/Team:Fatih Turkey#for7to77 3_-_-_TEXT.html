FATIH TURKEY IN THE BEST NEWSPAPERS OF TURKEY
The success achieved in Holland drew a big  attention in our country. Many newspapers and televisions interviewed with us.  We used this as an opportunity to introduce synthetic biology and iGEM. Our  national television TRT (Television and Radio of Turkey) has come to our  laboratory to shoot a short film about us. We told them our project, our  success in Regional Jamboree and also future of synthetic biology in Turkey as  well as in the world. The famous columnists in Turkey have written about us in  their columns, and we got very nice feedbacks.
Zaman, Milliyet, and Posta newspapers have  written about our team and project. These newspapers have a big audience. To  give an example, circulation of Zaman is 969.593 which makes it the leader  newspaper in Turkey. Moreover, with circulation of Posta (466.220) and Milliyet  (137.192), we achieved an outstanding outreach number of people. The more  people informed about SynBio, the more people would attend in iGEM; thus we find  this result very important.
