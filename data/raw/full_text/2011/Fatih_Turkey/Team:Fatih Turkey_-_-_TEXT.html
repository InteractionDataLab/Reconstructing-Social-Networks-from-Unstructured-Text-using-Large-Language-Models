Overall Project
Sterilization is so critical in science, especially in medicine. We all try hard to get rid of very tiny creatures; but it is difficut sometimes. Then, we thought: What if a bacterium would stop the harmful kinds and keep the things clean? Check out our project that presents a new sterilization technique.
LALF
How to stop a gram negative bacteria? Well, some proteins do that. In our Project, Limulus anti-lipopolysaccharide factor binds gram negative cell Wall and stops its growth. Check out our LALF page to learn more about our protein.
Reflectin
The fellowship of colors... Our "rainbow" protein, reflectin, is the second protein we studied on. It is used as an indicator in our Project. To learn more, check out our reflectin page.
Experiments
Our idea may seem reasonable and possible. But, you would have some doubts about it. See what we have done in our lab and how we tested our proteins.
Parts
We are constructing the future with BioBricks. If you are  curious about the genes of experiments we designed; check out our parts  submitted page.
Future Plan
It is just the beginning. Who would guess what will happen in next few years? Actually, we foreseen some applications about our proteins that may be very useful in the future. Check out the prospective projectsin our future plan page.

Canvas Town The Game
Human Practice
Canvas Town Game has been designed like that any person can play and learn very useful information about organisms, techniques and devices used mostly in a synthetic biology lab and about iGEM interesting Biobrick parts.
