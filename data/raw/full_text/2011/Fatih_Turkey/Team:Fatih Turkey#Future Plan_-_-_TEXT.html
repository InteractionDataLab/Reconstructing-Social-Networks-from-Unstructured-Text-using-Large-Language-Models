Future Plan
Our project may suggest some useful ideas about varying applications that may be very crucial in the future.
For our Limulus anti lipopolysaccharide factor protein (LALF); some idea suggestions can be enumerated as:
       
      
    
Alternative surface sterilization technique; in case of applying on surfaces, LALF protein can work like a new sterilization material like gluteraldehyte or alcohol that are commonly used for hospital and lab sterilization. Considering the diseases and pandemics caused by gram negatives, (including the recent EHEC pandemic occurred in Europe), this possibility underlines the importance of LALF and similar factors.
Alternative cure for septic shock; after gram negative bacterial infections; LPS, which is the main component of cell wall of gram negative bacteria, can cause deathly conditions that is generally called “septic shock”. In our project, our LALF protein binds this material strictly, thus LALF can be used as an alternative cure method for such condition.
Possible new structure of antibiotic-like drug; antibiotics commonly effect on production of cell wall of bacteria. This is done by inhibiting the source of the production. On the other hand, our LALF protein directly binds the cell wall material and stops the bacteria growth. Thus, a new antibiotic like drug made of LALF may be produced and used in some infections. In addition, in biological laboratories, LALF may offer an alternative decontamination method.
Possibility of producing longtime sterile layers; if any kind of object is produced by covering with LALF, that object can stay sterile for long time because of gram negative bacteria protection of LALF. In the case of a possible infection on surface, LALF will stop bacteria growth.
Alternative cure method for bacterial diseases; diseases like urinary system infection or gastritis are caused by gram negative bacteria. In the course of applying our bacteria that produce LALF in the infectious cite, infection of harmful bacteria can be prevented or stopped. This may suggest an alternative cure for such diseases.
On the other hand, our secondary protein, reflectin, can be used in varying applications.
Camouflage material; this protein allows its host, cephalopod, to hide when cephalopod hunts or defends itself from its hunters. In the course of development of reflectin protein, a new camouflage material may be produced for humans
New material of dye for varying applications; Dye that changes its color can be used almost every colorful application. From fireworks to wall paints, from windows of buildings to road signs, this ability can be very useful.
Possibility of producing specialized light colors; in some circumstances, a unique light color may be necessary in order to gain maximum output like in greenhouses or dark rooms in photography industry. Reflectin reflects the light by changing its wavelength; therefore the light that is reflected has only one color. This ability can be applied in such application that mentioned above.
It is planned that E.coli would synthesize reflectin while B.subtilis would produce LALF. Thus, as the growth of E.coli slows down and, finally, stops; thickness of layer of E.coli colonies would thinner than the thickness of B.subtilis layer. Depending on tinting ability of reflectin, we would observe the media in different colors that indicates the result very easily. This sample presents us a new biosensor method in prospective lab experiments.
 
                       
                                            
Beyond the above, we are also planning to
…purify B.subtilis biofilm with LALF via Fenton Reagent solution. Fenton Reagent is supposed to kill B.subtilis colonies and endospores. Alternative methods would make this model possible.
…see tinting ability of reflectin. Reflectin can be purified and observed with specific methods.
