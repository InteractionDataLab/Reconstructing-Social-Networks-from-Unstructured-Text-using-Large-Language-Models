Exposure Experiments
In this experiment, we aimed to stop gram negative  growth in solid medium (LB) by exposing it to LALF via liquid culture of its  host or supernatant. We used B.subtilis as the host of LALF. With the results;  we wanted to confirm that both of our LALF and signal peptides work.
By adding E. Coli on Bacillus Subtilis;
Assay 1:  We put E. Coli on the B. Subtilis  with LALF (K541915) biofilm. For this purpose, we first prepared a corn starch  plate with liquid LB medium and added 100 ul B. Subtilis liquid medium as a  point over it. For a qualified biofilm, we incubated it for 24 hours at 37˚C.
Later, we dropped 10 uL E. Coli with RFP as a single  point and again incubated it.
In order to understand whether LALF protein or another  factor killed E. Coli on the Bacillus biofilm, we prepared the same contrivance  with a B. subtilis biofilm that does not produce LALF protein or does not  include antibiotic.
Also, we prepared an alternative plate that does only  include antibiotic in order to avoid a false result.
Assay 2: Without adding corn starch, production rate of biofilm by B.subtilis  extremely decreases. This allows us to test the effectiveness of LALF in  non-biofilm media. We put E. coli as a single point while B. subtilis spread is  fresh. We aimed to see if B. Subtilis could kill E. coli without forming a  biofilm.
We prepared a control group by preparing the same  contrivance with only B Subtilis that does not produce LALF protein.  Alternatively, we spread B. Subtilis that does not produce LALF protein but has  antibiotic resistance and added E.Coli with RFP as a single drop over it.
 By adding E. Coli over B. Subtilis;
Assay 3: We added 100 ul liquid culture of B. Subtilis with  LALF, over the normal LB medium applied E. coli with RFP as a single drop. The  aim here is to test the effect of LALF contraversly comparing with Assay 2.
Over the fresh spread of E. coli, 100 ul of liquid  culture of wild B. Subtilis strain as a single drop. As an alternative  contrivance, we added B. Subtilis that has only antibiotic resistance over the  fresh spread of E. coli with RFP likewise. We aimed to see the affect of  antibiotic resistance over E. coli with RFP, by using B. subtilis with and  without antibiotic resistance.
Assay 4: We repeated the Assay 3 by adding the supernatant of  B.subtilis instead of its liquid culture. Of course, again we used fresh spread  of E.coli with RFP and we added single drop of inhibitor solution.
Control groups were B.subtilis construct without LALF  and antibiotic resistance. A second control group is designed to test  antibiotic effect on inhibition by inserting antibiotic resistance of bacteria.
