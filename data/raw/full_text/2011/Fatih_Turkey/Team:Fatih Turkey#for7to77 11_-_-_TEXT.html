Synthetic Biology Meeting Turkey
COLLABORATION WITH POLITICS CLUB
Synthetic  biology is a brand new field of study that develops very fast. While new  projects come out in time, the questions and problems pop out. Recent example  was the big debate that took place in Europe Jamboree: “The Meeting of Young  Minds”. In the event, young politicians of Holland and iGEM team members  discussed synthetic biology, its properties and future.
Beyond of  that, during the development of the science, it can also be abused and bring  catastrophes to humanity. Informing people and encouraging to use it for the  sake of people is very important because of this reality.
From this  perspective, we discussed this issue with our friends from politics club of our  university in İstanbul. We told them what synthetic biology is, what the  scientists can do via designing the organisms with BioBricks and what this  science would bring to humanity in the future. Then, politics club made a  private meeting between them and declared a report about synthetic biology and  aspects of people about it:
According  to members of the club;
An  obligatory to all countries that can use synthetic biology technology must be  prepared and declared like Kyoto Protocol. It is believed that this will slow  down or prevent possible abuses of synthetic biology.
An  authorized committee whose members are experts of their fields of study related  with synthetic biology must be assembled. This committee must control whole  studies about SynBio. Some sanctions should be applied by this committee to who  abuse this field or become harmful to humanity.
