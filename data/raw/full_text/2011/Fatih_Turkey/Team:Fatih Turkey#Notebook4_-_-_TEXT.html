                >>>>>>All of them have been isolated and digested with EcoR1, Pst1 then  made electrophoresis for confirmation.
We have growned another some colonies from 1002+1006/sht and 1001+1006/sht (which grown in two antibiotics before) overnight (yesterday) and today they have been stroke which contain two antibiotics  in the morning and their falcons have been kept in the fridge .
1002+1006/sht
     >>>which picked colonies  x ,y ,z ,t   from A plate
>>> which picked colonies   Ax , Bx, Cx , Dx , Ex  from B plate
1001+1006/sht 
    >>>which picked colonies  Ax , Bx , Cx , Dx  from A plate
>>> which picked colonies  x,y,z,t,s  from B plate
  In the evening we observed  1001+1006/sht     By,  ADx , Bs streaks didn’t grow so we put in the new liquid culture from their morning’s liquid culture for glycerol stock. Also we prepared second  new liquid culture By for it’s plasmid isolation and confirmation.
1002+1005/sht  C have been taken from glycerol stock and put in liquid culture for plasmid isolation. (it’s necessary for bacillus transformation to our DISC test)

    >>> >>>>>>all of them have been isolated which put in liquid culture from yesterday. But plasmid isolation kit’s coloumn finished.So we continued with gel extraction kit’s coloumn and it’s amount which in gel extraction protocol.Then we used electrophoresis.However we didn’t observed any clear and right band in electrophoresis.This may be because of our using different coloumn and protocol.So we didn’t make gel extraction and transformation.
We put them again liquid culture with Chl which choose different  colony called X, Y, Z, T, V .And also we put   1004+1005+K  B ,     1002+1005+K  A ,   1002+1005+K B ,    1004+1006+K  C,   1001+1006+K  A  in liquid culture with Chl which confirmed in electrophoresis and took with  gel extraction.
