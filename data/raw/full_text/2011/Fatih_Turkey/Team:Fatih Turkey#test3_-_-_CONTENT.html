The organization’s aim was to arrange meeting with all Turkey iGEM team members and researchers and related companies in order to discuss the Synthetic biology in Turkey and the iGEM competition potential on ongoing studies. In this case, all of iGEM teams and Bio- entrepreneurship company owners presented their presentations also some foreign academics talked about synthetic biology and gave some helpful advices to listeners with helping the teleconferences. It was very informed for us also very enjoyed. We presented a succesful presentation which is about our project and played our Canwas Town Game with other iGEM Turkey teams.

As a medical school, our hospital has its own quarterly magazine, “Yasama  Sanati” (in English: The <EM>Art of Living</EM>).  We decided that we could mention about iGEM and synthetic biology; thus we  wrote an article that told the bacteria is not too much harmful living creature to  humans as it is seen nowadays. In fact, we mentioned that bacteria would become  very handy, helpful and inteligent “machines” in appropiate conditions. We  listed the former experiments and parts that took place in iGEM competition and  gave some examples about what to do next. 
              We also talked about iGEM  competition and its international character. In the article attending of 130  teams throughout the world, seperation of competition to stages by continents  and the teams from Turkey attending to iGEM were mentioned. The article took  place in the magazine published on July- August- September 2011.  Considering its innovation and presentation  for synthetic biology and iGEM competition, we found this work too important.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width="891" border="0" style="background: #F9F9F9; font-family: Verdana, Arial, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif !important; text-align: justify;"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="3" align="center" valign="top" class="style10" style="font-size: 21px;">We have got company!<SPAN class="style12">                                                                                                                               <SPAN class="style13">July 2011</SPAN></SPAN></TD></TR><TR><TD height="78" align="center" valign="top"><P align="justify">During  the  planning  of  our  experiments,  we had some  visitors  from  other  universities throughout Turkey, whom were curious about our lab in which our works taking place.

Finally, we encouraged them to participate in the iGEM competition and recommended studying on genetics and synthetic biology.

                engineering is!
                Our one of the most important goals as a team Fatih_Turkey is to introduce iGEM
                and Synthetic
                Biology to the students in Turkey. But we did not want to limit ourselves
                by choosing only same age groups and we decided to tell the
                children, too. </P><P align="justify">Synthetic biology has been told them by consultating
                    with several pre-school institutions. Also
                    we told them that bacteria do not cause only diseases ,in fact, they can also do good
                    things for people. For
                    example; they can heal the wound or they can produce light. </P><P align="justify">Then, we asked
                  what
                  their bacteria can do for them. We want them to show their ideas by painting. They are
                  only 6-age individuals but they have a lot of
                  original idea that can be seen by looking their paintings.
                  For instance;
                  * Bacteria that extends the hair 8 cm in 3 minutes',
                  * Bacteria massagers under the bed',
                  * Singer bacteria etc.
                  Consequently, we have told children that bacteria are not too harmful creatures
                  In fact, sometimes, they would be very useful for people.

                We mentioned iGEM competition and some experiments that took place in the competition in our poster. And we asked them what you want your bacteria do for you if you change their genome. We wanted them to

                  things from their bacteria.
                  such as; 
   'Either exist as you are, or be as you look.(M.J.Rumi)', 'My bacteria come to school for me'
   'My bacteria rewind time(it was told after
