1.       Transformation was done for 915 gex  21/06 , 915 gex 31/06.
2.       Isolation was done for 4x800, 536, 546. These parts are also digested with EcoR1 and Pst1.
3.       Digestion was also done for 500, 1, 2, 5, 6 and 900 in order to ligate these to gain 515, 525, 516, 526, 916, 925 , 926. Digested genes are loaded into gel.
4.       815, 816, 825, 826, 515, 525, 516, 526, 916, 925 and 926 are ligated.

1.       Two colonies had been chosen for each of 536 and 546. LBs of these parts are isolated and digested with EcoR1 and Pst1 afterwards.
2.       Digested parts are loaded into gel.
a.       536-ALASKA and 546-BELARUS are found correct. However; in the 536-ALASKA gel fragment, there are two unknown and unexpected bands which must be considered carefully.
3.       515, 525, 516, 526, 815, 825, 816, 826, 925, 916 and 926 could not be transformated because of lack of plates with chloramphenicol.
4.       LBs of 915 gex 2/9 and 915 gex 31/8 are prepared.
5.       915 gex 2/9, 915 gex 31/8 and 800-e are digested with Spe1 and Xba1 in order to achieve ligation without needing Pst1 because of the false Pst1 site in 800-e.

14.09.11
1.       915 gex 31/8 and 915 gex 2/9 are isolated.
2.       Same samples are digested with EcoR1 and Pst1.
3.       Digested parts and additionally 800e that had been digested with same enzymes are loaded into gel.
4.       For each of 815 gex, 915 gex and 916, two colonies are chosen in B.subtilis plates and LBs are prepared.
5.       LB-agar is prepared in order to perform transformation for unconfirmed parts.
