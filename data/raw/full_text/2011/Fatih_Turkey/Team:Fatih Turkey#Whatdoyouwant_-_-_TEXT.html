WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM YOUR BACTERIA TO DO FOR YOU?
Fatih  Turkey ask medical school students that if you are an expert on                  synthetic biology, what you want from your  bacteria to do for you?
Another activity that we did is in Fatih Medical  School; firstly we had                  prepared a poster, then we hanged to our campus.                  We told them İGEM competition and some good  bacteria in our poster. And we                 asked them; What                 do your bacteria do for you if you change their  genome? And we wanted to                 write their opinions on the poster. And we decided                  surprise award for winner whom has given the best  opinion.
Our colleagues                   have as children as originals idea. They were like                   that activity because it was done at exams time so  they reduced stres on                   writing their imagine on the board with thinking  their exams                   and their hero bacteria which would save them from  the exams. Our colleagues                   wanted to impossible                   things from their bacteria.
Such as; 'Either exist as you are, or be as you  look.(M.J.Rumi)',
 'my bacteria come to school for me, they get  back to time(it was told after                   exams=)',
 'my bacteria enter my brain to increase my  brain activity to 100%.'
 'My  bacteria oversee for me (how poor assistant)' etc.
Of course  all ideas were not case.
It s  adhesive to cell membrane and regulate   to nutritional value.
It s  produce to water because few years later the world will be completely desert.
It s  repair to ozone layer.
It s  grind to rubbish.
People  whom have interests about IGEM and Synthetic biolgy, have also
increased thanks to the poster.
