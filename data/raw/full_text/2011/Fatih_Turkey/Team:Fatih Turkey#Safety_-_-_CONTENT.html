Would the  materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:</STRONG><STRONG>a. Risks to  the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?</STRONG><P>Actually few hazardous chemicals and solutions such as  EtBr are used in some lab procedures such as gel preparation and  electrophoresis. However these chemicals and solutions are used according to  the safety rules of the laboratory with care and caution. All the members were  trained for safety regulations of the laboratory as well as toxicity of the  chemicals and solutions before starting the current project.<STRONG>b. Risks to  the safety and health of the general public if released by design or accident?</STRONG></P><P>When released by accident, our parts and materials  actually cause no negative damage to the general public. B.subtilis is known  not to be associated with disease process in humans in regular conditions, and  thus, is supposed to be benign by nature and present no danger to anyone. Only  under stress conditions, B. subtilis may form spores and these spores are  resistant versions of single cells. While B. subtilis itself is not pathogenic,  its spores may be infectious if inhaled. But all of our team members are trained  for safety of the laboratory rules and use mask and gloves when dealing with  bacteria. Besides all experiments are performed in synthetic laboratory  designated by Fatih University Medical School and no material is carried out of  the laboratory. However to increase public safety of our project, in case of  accident, our plan is to destroy particles and spores of B.subtilis by treating  with Fenton reagent solutions containing dissolved oxygen and other  constituents.<STRONG>c. Risks to  environmental quality if released by design or accident?</STRONG></P><P>Bacillus subtilis strain 3610 is a wild type strain  that is already widespread in the environment. B. subtilis strain 168 is a  derivative strain of the 3610 and has disabling auxotrophs mutations that make  it even less likely to colonize or cause harm to human or animal health. Our  experiment does not include any modifications, which enhance their ability to  survive or disseminate. Thus, there is no specific environmental risk  associated with use of the Bacillus subtilis strains except its spore  formation. In case of accident, cleaning and treating the spores with Fenton  reagent as mentioned above provide environmental safety. Besides, all  procedures are performed in a specified laboratory.</P><P>E. Coli strains TOP10 and BL1 have very limited  ability to survive outside the laboratory; so that, it would be unable to  survive or disseminate. Therefore, there is no specific environmental risk  associated with the E. coli strains. All bacterial wastes are kept in 10%  bleaching solution for one day, and then, are autoclaved to be sterilized.<STRONG>d. Risks to  security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?</STRONG></P><P>Please explain your responses (whether yes or no) to  these questions. Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project  associated with (or known to cause):</P><P><STRONG>    * pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity?</STRONG> No<STRONG>    * threats to environmental quality?</STRONG> No<STRONG>    * security concerns?</STRONG> No</P><P>As explained above:
  Nothing could be used maliciously in our project. The  materials we use are commonly used in experimental procedures in various  laboratories all over the world and all are harmless and do not pose any threat  to environment and public as well as security concerns.</P><P>Throughout the project, we used the Escherichia coli  strains Top10 and BL1; Bacillus subtilis strains 3610 and 168. Wild-type E.  coli is classified as hazard group 2 pathogen by the UK Advisory Committee on  the Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) and Wild-type Bacillus subtilis (i.e. strain  3610) is classified as hazard group 1 organism by the ACDP and its derivative  B. subtilis strain 168 has disabling auxotrophs mutations (e.g. conferring a  requirement for tryptophan, Zeigler DR et al, 2008. J of Bacteriology) that  makes it even less likely to colonize or cause harm to human or animal health.  B.subtilis is at level 1 biosafety according to World Health Organization  (WHO).<STRONG>2. If your  response to any of the questions above is yes:</STRONG><STRONG>a. Explain how  you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting laboratory  work.</STRONG><STRONG>b. Describe  and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you submit  your parts to the Registry</STRONG><STRONG>3. Under what  biosafety provisions will / do you operate?</STRONG><STRONG>a. Does your  institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they? Provide a  link to them online if possible</STRONG></P><P>Yes, our institution has its own biosafety rules.  Rules for laboratory use, general principles, prevention from hazardous  materials and application of emergency intervention in case of accident are  included. The web link is given as  (http://www.fatihmed.edu.tr/icerik/guvenlikkilavuzu.php).<STRONG>b. Does your  institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If  yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or  changes that were made based on this review</STRONG></P><P>Yes. In Fatih University Medical School, Laboratory  and Patient-Employee Safety Committee is responsible for control as well as  biosafety of laboratories and safety of patients and employees. This committee  works under one of the vice medical director of Fatih University Hospital,  Prof. Dr. Mehmet Gunduz. Form on safety rules of Fatih University Medical  School Laboratory use was filled in as required. We discussed our project with  Prof. Dr. Mehmet Gunduz. Safety and security issues are found sufficient enough  that no change is considered as necessary. (Further questions can be directed  to Prof. Gunduz, tel: +90-312-203 5103, mgunduz@fatih.edu.tr)<STRONG>c. Will / did  you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If  so, describe this training.</STRONG></P><P>Yes, we did. Our advisor provided us with biosafety  and lab training before starting our project. In the training, general safety  rules of laboratory use, prevention from hazardous chemicals and solutions as  well as emergency intervention in case of accident were included such as:</P><UL><LI> - Eating, drinking, storing food and smoking are  absolutely not allowed. </LI><LI> - Mouth pipetting is not allowed; modern pipettes  are used in lab.</LI><LI> - Hazardous wastes and ordinary wastes are  separated and cautiously disposed.</LI><LI> - Lab coats are obligatory to wear in the lab and  during on-going experiments.</LI><LI> - In electrophoresis room, lab coat, protective  eyewear, lab masks and gloves have to be worn. In the case of use of EtBr;  extra caution is required.</LI><LI> - Washing hands after any experiment and after touching  anything related with viable material is obliged.</LI><LI> - Air conditioning is kept closed during on-going experiments  in order to avoid possible infections of spores and bacteria.</LI></UL><P><STRONG>d. Does your  country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a  link to them online if possible.</STRONG></P><P>Yes, Turkey has national biosafety regulations and the  link is given as  (http://www.tbbdm.gov.tr/Home/BioSafetyCouncilHome/BioSafetyCouncilHomeChoose.aspx).<STRONG>4. OPTIONAL  QUESTION: Do you have other ideas on how to deal with safety or security issues  that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and  systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?</STRONG></P><P> - First, IGEM committee may prepare a lab safety  acknowledgement form like OSHA form. This form can be required to be filled in  by all members. This will allow us to confirm whether members of the teams are  informed about safety issues and standardize the safety measurements.
    - Second, a new prize related with security and safety  issues may take place in the judging procedure separated from “Best Human  Practices” prize. Existence of “Best Safety Part” or “Best Safety Application”  can emphasize the importance of the safety issues and inspire iGEM teams to  work on these issues and may give a chance to develop new ideas, to interrogate  current safety and security applications in order to improve them.
    - Third, iGEM committee may organize a webinar to inform  the participants about safety and security in labs. Webinar can be done at the  beginning of the experiments. Mentor scientists may talk about their experiences  and mention some tricks about safety issues.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV><H3 style="color:#BBB;">Sponsors</H3></DIV></DIV><DIV class="copyright">
