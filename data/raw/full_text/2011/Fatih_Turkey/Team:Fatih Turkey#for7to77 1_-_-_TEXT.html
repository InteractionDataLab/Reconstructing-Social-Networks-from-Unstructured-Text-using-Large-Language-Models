HIGH  SCHOOL DIVISION
High schools have started to join iGEM  from this year. We think that this is really important and necessary. However, how much are the high schools in Turkey aware of iGEM and synthetic biology?
As Fatih_Turkey team, we went to some  high schools of Ankara to inform high school students about that opportunity  and also to help them to assemble their own teams. Firstly, we gave a  presentation, told them the future of synthetic biology and its fields of use.  Then, we introduced them with iGEM, told the rationale behind it, interesting  projects from previous years, and our own project. Also, in order to teach iGEM  and synthetic biology in an enjoyable way we played our game altogether.  Students who played the game understood the iGEM and logic of biobrick more  clearly. After the presentation and the game, we got very good reactions from  students. They said that they would like to assemble a team and asked about the  materials required for laboratory studies. We talked about the instruments and  materials and also stated that we could help them whenever they needed.
As a result, we realized that high  school students did not know much about synthetic biology and iGEM, which is  quite natural. However, we believe that if we tell and encourage them, some  students might choose to study in this field which may lead new useful  projects. As Fatih Turkey team, we will support, encourage and help them as  much as we can for next years’ competitions.
The high schools which we informed:
- Ahmet Ulusoy High School
- Private Samanyolu Serhat High School
- Nene Hatun High School
- Nevin Gökçek High School
- Öncü High School
In  order to teach iGEM and synthetic biology in a funny way to people of all ages,  we prepared a monopoly-like game. We played the game in our own university, and  also in high schools where we went to introduce iGEM. We had a great time while  playing the game with our friends and teenagers from the high schools. We also  got really good reactions from the players, and one of the most interesting  suggestions was that we had to sell this game.
Moreover, the players were given a survey  prepared to measure the effect of the game. What is synthetic biology? What can  be done by it? What is the logic behind the projects of iGEM? Those were the  questions that they could find the answers in this game. The game not only gave  them an idea about the iGEM or synthetic biology, but it also taught them the names  of some mostly used antibiotics, principles of some experiments, and laboratory  instruments, such as autoclave.
All  the process is full of unforgettable moments, and they will remain in our  memories for long and long years.
