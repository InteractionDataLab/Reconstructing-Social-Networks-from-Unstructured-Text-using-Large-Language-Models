GIFTED CHILDREN 
During our lab studies, we  have hosted lots of visitors. Some of them were gifted children. Those children  go to several different schools in Ankara (the capital city of Turkey) and are  seen as some of the most intelligent students of Ankara. Their ages range  between 10-13and they are interested in genetics very much. We talked with them  about our Project, synthetic biology and İGEM competition. Also, we played the  Canvas Town Game and it was really fun. In the game, there were three groups  which were B. Subtilis, E. Coli, virus and each group had a leader who was a  member of our team. At the beginning of the game, there were three groups but  at the end there was just one winner and the virus group was the lucky group.
