Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) for Bacillus subtilis
Constitutive promoter veg(BBa_K143012) coupled to the strong Ribosome Binding Site spoVG(BBa_K143021) from B. subtilis. These parts have been taken from 2008_Imperial_Collage. Pveg is a constitutive promoter that constitutively expresses the P43 protein in B. subtilis.
SpoVG is an endogenous ribosome binding site from B. subtilis. The sequence of the spoVG ribosome binding site is AAAGGUGGUGA which is complementary to the sequence UUUCCUCCACU from the 3′ region of the 16s rRNA from B. subtilis.
SacB is a signal peptide used in the Sec-SRP (secretory signal recognition particle) pathway by B. subtilis. Signal peptides are responsible for directing preproteins (secretory proteins with a signal peptide region attached) through an appropriate secretory pathway. In the case of the Sec-SRP signal peptide, they direct preproteins from the cytoplasm into the growth medium.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or endotoxin, is the major mediator of septic shock, a serious complication of Gram-negative bacterial infections in humans. Molecules that bind LPS and neutralize its biological effects or enhance its clearance could have important clinical applications. Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) binds LPS tightly, and, in animal models, reduces mortality when administered before or after LPS challenge or bacterial infection. The wedge- shaped molecule has a striking charge distribution and amphipathicity that suggest how it can insert into membranes. The binding site for LPS probably involves an extended amphipathic loop, and it has been proposed that two mammalian LPS-binding proteins will have a similar loop. The amphipathic loop structure may be used in the design of molecules with therapeutic properties against septic shock.

B.subtilis and E.coli Episomal Shuttle Vector with Consitutive RFP to express in E.coli
This episomal vector has within its BioBrick region a constitutively expressed RFP gene in E.coli. It uses LacI promoter, B0034, mRFP1 (E0010) and B0015.
