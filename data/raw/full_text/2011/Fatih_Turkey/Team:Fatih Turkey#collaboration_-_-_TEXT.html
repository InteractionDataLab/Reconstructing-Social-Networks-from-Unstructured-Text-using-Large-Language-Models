Collaborating with other iGEMers is very  important. Science cannot be done lonely, helping other people in iGEM will  develop this field of study. What goes around comes around.
During our lab studies, we were always keeping  touch with other teams. We were helping each other and making some activities  together.
We assisted the Bilkent_UNAM_Turkey team when  they have some problems with their shuttle vector. We gived them our  BBa_K541026 (Reflectin 1A (SacB) and LALF (LipA) protein for B.subtilis). Also,  we helped them in the characterization of BBa_K090401 (Gram-positive Shuttle  Vector for Episomal Expression), BBa_K090402 (B.subtilis Episomal Vector with  Constitutive GFP) and BBa_K090403(Gram-positive Shuttle Vector for Chromosomal  Integration) parts. And they helped us by providing some laboratory  materials. Thanks for their great help.
Team Michigan asked for advice for the design of  their board game. According to our experices gained while we are designing our  own game, we stated some useful and important points. We were being glad to  help them.
Thanks to METU-Ankara team for their kind  invitation. Association of Synthetic Biology and METU-Ankara Team invited our  team to Synthetic Biology Turkey Meetings 1.0 of iGEM Turkey Teams. This  meeting was really enjoyable and informative.
We planned a little tournament of Canvas Town  Game in the Asia and Europe Region Jamborees. For this organization, we asked  helping from Region Asia and Europe Organization Committee and they helped us  very quickly and politely. We played the game in the Europe Jamboree and the  reaction of players was very positive.
We decided to rewrite B.subtilis chasis,  Biobricks and their contents with Paris Bettencourt team. Thanks for their big  help. We also shared our plasmids and protocols related to transformation of  B.subtilis.
With these activities we were really enjoyed and  informed.
