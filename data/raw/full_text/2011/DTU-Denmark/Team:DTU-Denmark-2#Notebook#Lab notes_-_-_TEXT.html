Week 1: 04.07.2011 - 10.07.2011
First week! Time was spent on designing the Plug 'n' Play assembly system, figuring out what 48 biobricks to construct, and searching for appropriate DNA templates.
Week 2: 11.07.2011 - 17.07.2011
Wednesday
The first batch of primers have been ordered, so we are waiting in excitement for them to arrive, so we can start our work in the lab.
Week 3: 18.07.2011 - 24.07.2011
Tuesday
First day in the lab and 48 biobricks to go. This is exciting!
We plan to construct 48 new BioBricks. We have now established 17 of them and ordered primers for them with USER tails. We started the day with 11 PCR reactions. 6 of them were correct, and they were purified with a purification Kit (GE Healthcare). Only 42 biobricks to go!
Biobricks in the bag:
pAlc ( BBa_K678001 )
TtrpC ( BBa_K678036 )
Terminator 1  ( BBa_K678037 )
Terminator 2  ( BBa_K678038 )
Terminator 3  ( BBa_K678039 )
argB ( BBa_K678043 )
Thursday
The failed PCR reactions from tuesday were repeated. This time we used a different annealing temperature, and....IT WORKED!
New biobricks in the bag:
PGK ( BBa_K678004 )
BGHpA ( BBa_K678019 )
eGFP+k_GOI ( BBa_K678007 )
The fragments will be frozen and later purified.
We still have not succeed to make BioBricks pyrG and pyrG-DR (used as a marker in fungi), despite different PCR attempts with a high annealing (59°) and low (56°) temperature.
Work for iGEM Copenhagen team
We have established collaboration with the iGEM team from Copenhagen University. We will costumize a number of their BioBricks to use with our Plug 'n' Play system. This is a great way of showing how easy it is to costumize the Plug 'n' Play system for any application, and the Copenhagen team will save a lot of time.  Today we transformed competent E.coli cells with some of the standard biological parts from iGEM, BBa_R0010 , Bba_B0015 and BBa_J52034 , and later we will make them fit the Plug 'n' Play with DNA system.
Friday
We made a PCR of a troublesome BioBrick again - but this time with a small modification. We made a PCR mix with and without MgCl2 50mM in the reactions. And...IT WORKED with MgCl2 50mM!
Biobrick obtained:
CMV ( BBa_J52034 )
hygR ( BBa_K678042 )
The fragments will be frozen and later purified .
Week 4: 25.07.2011 - 31.07.2011
Monday
We got a new delivery of primers from IDT today. They are to be diluted and stocked, before use.   We have had some difficulty with obtaining 5 of our new biobricks; SV40+ori, SV40 pA, LacZ, pyrG and pyrG-DR. We ran a touch PCR program, where the annealing temperature ran from 55° to 65° for each sample in each cycle.
The PCR reactions were successful, and following biobricks are ready for Plug'n'Play:
SV40 +ori ( BBa_K678005 )
SV40 pA ( BBa_K678012 )
LacZ ( BBa_K678026 )
Tuesday
The primers recieved yesterday will be used for amplification of many many many new biobricks today.
Out of 15 PCR reactions 5 succeeded:
GFP_GOI ( BBa_K678028 )
GFP_modul ( BBa_K678027 )
GFP_TS ( BBa_K678029 )
eGFP_TS ( BBa_K678007 )
eGFP_module ( BBa_K678009 )
Wednesday
Today we have run 8 reactions, 3 standard and 5 touch PCR reactions on some of the biobricks that we still have difficulties obtaining.
One succeeded:
hgH-polyA ( BBa_K678018 )
August
Week 5: 01.08.2011 - 07.08.2011
Monday
New week, new energy, and lots of team spirit! Today 15 PCR reactions were conducted, including parts for iGEM Copenhagen team. 14 succeeded. The annealing temperature was increased to 63°, and it worked like magic!

Wednesday
There are still 2 BioBricks that we haven't been able to obtain with PCR: pyrG and pyrG-DR.
Today we tried again with gradient PCR to find the optimal melting temperature, but no magic happened.
Thursday
22 BioBricks, which have been obtained with PCR during the last week of laboratory work, was purified today. The purification of DNA was done by using the Illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). The procedure was carried out according to the manufactures protocol for purification of DNA from TAE and TBE agarose gels, see protocol section for more information.
Despite several attempts we have not been able to obtain BioBrick pyrG and pyrG-DR. Therefore we made a test with well-known primers without USER-tails (sometimes these USER-tails can be tricky). This was done to verify if something was wrong with the DNA template. The gel electrophoresis did not show any bands, and thereby it revealed that the DNA template was the source of error. Problem solved!
We also started cultivation of the mammalian cell line, U2OS, which is derived from a patient with osteosarcoma (bone cancer). They were defrosted and cultivated in DMEM medium containing serum, penicillin and streptomycin. The cell line was then transferred to a 25 cm2 culture flask, see protocol section.
Week 5: 08.08.2011 - 14.08.2011
Monday
Today we made the first USER cloning, we are very excited to see if the system works the way, we want it to!

Thursday
The coverslips covered with transfected U2OS cells were washed and fixated. We put the coverslips upside down on a glass slide and fixated them with nailpolish (very high fashion). We took them on a little journey to building 301 to get confocal pictures of them - and they looked great and green.

Week 8: 22.08.2011 - 28.08.2011
Monday
The U2OS cells were splitted and passed on to a new culture flask and to coverslips placed in the bottom of 2 6-well-plates.
Tuesday
The U2OS cells were transfected with all the mammalian plasmides.Hopefully, we will get some really cool pictures soon with cells expressing RFP, CFP, YFP, GFP, and GFP targeted to the peroxisomes.
Measurements of plasmids containing our devices before sending them to DNA Technology for sequencing. The measurements were done with Qubit Fluorometer from Invitrogen.
More restriction analysis of plasmids were done.
Wednesday
The coverslips covered with transfected cells were washed and fixated. We put the coverslips upside down on a glass slide and fixated them with nailpolish. We took them to building 301 for confocal microscopy. The cells looked great -everything worked = we are done with the mammalian cells. Hip hip hurra!
Transformation of Aspergillus nidulans for proof of concept.

Week 9: 29.08.2011 - 04.09.2011
Tuesday
Plasmids and primers were sent to DNA Technology for sequencing.
Wednesday
PCR reaction of the shipping plasmid were done. USER tails were applied to the shipping plasmid, so it can be easy and quick assembled with the 2 BioBricks and the device.
Thursday
USER cloning of the two promoters and device 12 with the shipping plasmid were done.
Due to the extensive use of biobrick plasmid_fun(28) and plasmid_mam(30) we made some more.
Week 10: 05.09.2011 - 11.09.2011
Monday
Restriction analysis of shipping plasmid was made to ensure that the USER cloning were done correctly. The shipping plasmid was sent to sequencing.
Inoculation of fungi for β-galactosidase, Bradford assay and Fluorescence microscope.
Tuesday
Today we checked out our fungi in fluorescence microscope, a beautiful sight it was! We have now proven that our system works in fungi as well as in mammalian cells.
Wednesday
A whole day was spent in the lab doing the β-galactosidase and Bradford assay for characterisation of our two promoters.
Friday
This might be one of the last iGEM days in lab. We are measuring the DNA concentration of the biobricks, so they can be sent to MIT next week.
