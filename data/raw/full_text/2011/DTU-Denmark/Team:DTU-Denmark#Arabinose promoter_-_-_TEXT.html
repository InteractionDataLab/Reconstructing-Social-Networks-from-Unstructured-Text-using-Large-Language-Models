Improving the arabinose promoter
Motivation
The arabinose promoter is used in our project to control the expression of the chiXR small RNA. This promoter is induced by the sugar arabinose.
Since control of the system is essential to the applicability of our system we attempted to modify the dynamic range of the arabinose promoter by two means: Rationally designing the -10 and -35 sequences of the promoter region, and generating a SPL of the arabinose promoter, changing the nucleotides around and between the -10 and the -35, without changing the -10 and -35 from wildtype.
Rationally designing the promoter
Since both the -35 (CTGACG) and the -10 (TACTGT) are far from wild-type (TTGACA and TATAAT respectively) we considered these as possible targets for improving the promoter.
Generating the SPL
