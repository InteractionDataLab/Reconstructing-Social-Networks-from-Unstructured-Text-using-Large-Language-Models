  Mikael Rørdam Andersen
About Mikael: Mikael is an associate professor at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, DTU. He knows everything there is to know about mammalian cells and Aspergilli. Mikael has a very unique but annoying skill - he knows everything that goes on in our building, which means that we can never surprise him with latest results, because he already knows it. Mikael is also our team mascot and goes under the name; Mojo Jojo!
