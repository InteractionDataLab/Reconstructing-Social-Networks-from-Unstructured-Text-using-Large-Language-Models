The Team
The team came together during the course 'Mammalian Cell Cultivations for Production of Heterologous Proteins' in the month of June. Due to our late team registration we have been working hard all summer to catch up with the other teams. Luckily Mathilde was able to work full time on the project from August and we recruited a fifth team member Maja who joined us in the middle of August. We are five students from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) all studying biotechnology at graduate level. The project is conducted at the Center for Microbial Biotechnology, where associate professor Mikael Rørdam Andersen is our supervisor together with Post Doc. Helene Faustrup Kildegaard and Ph.D. Dorte Koefoed Holm.
