Why Plug 'n' Play with DNA?
We have developed a standardized assembly system, called “Plug’n’Play with DNA”, where any biological parts can be gathered without use of restriction enzymes and ligases. The method applies long complementary overhangs on the PCR product as well as the destination vector. These overhangs are custom made and can anneal to each other to form a stable hybridization product. This means that the parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products are directly mixed with a vector, which makes assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. All the parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products will be distributed in microtiter plates directly ready for cloning. The simple and easy use of the system was demonstrated by developing a reporter targeting system for the mammalian cell line, U2OS, where GFP was targeted to the peroxisomes. In addition, application of our system was demonstrated in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans.
Team
We are five students that have been working hard the whole summer. We were lucky to be able to enter iGEM at a late time in the competition but this also gave us extra challenges and little time. You can learn more about our challenges and about us on our Team page.
A new assembly standard
We think that iGEM should be about assembling biobricks fast and combining them in any thinkable way with existing or new parts. Therefore we introduce a simple and fast way of building new devices or whatever you want with ready to use PCR products. Read more about the Plug'n'Play with DNA assembly standard.
BioBricks
We have been working hard to construct over 48 biological parts and have constructed over 25 vectors. Our favorite parts can be found on our Data Page .
