Attributions & Contributions
Students
Designed the experiments
Constructed an inducible SPL
Developed a model a small RNA regulatory system with two small RNAs
Constructed the IG9
Analyzed the data
Did bioinformatics studies of the system
Did the vast majority of the labwork
Designed and wrote the wiki
Sebastién Lemire
Did the first part of the bioinformatic study.
Helped us design the project
Supplied us with PCRs of backbones
Subcloned PBAD-chiXR and Ptet-chiX into other backbones
Helped improve the text on the wiki, especially the Improving AraBAD part.
Bjarne Albrektsen
Helped us with, and did many $\beta$-gal assays
Purified a number of plasmids for us
Provided patient guidance
Christopher Workman
Gave input while we developed the model
Helped analyzing data from the BioLektor
Gave constructive feedback on the wiki
Emmanouil Papadakis
Helped set up the BioLektor
Martin Overgaard
Supplied the IG302 strain
