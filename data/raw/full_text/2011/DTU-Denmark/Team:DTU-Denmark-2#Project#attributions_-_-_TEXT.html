Martin Weiss Nielsen has performed the confocal microscopy of the mammalian cells.
David Lemvigh has assisted us by providing javascript, HTML and CSS codes for our wiki page as well as debugging the wiki.
Hjalte Martin Larsen took our group photographs, profile pictures, and cool lab pictures.

The design of the Plug'n'Play standard, the design of linkers, primers and plasmids, all laboratory work conducted, the fundraising, the graphics, and the wiki page was conducted by the members of the DTU-Denmark-2 team: Anne Mathilde Lund, Elisa Wangsgaard Andreasen, Jaide Vold Korgaard Jensen, Julie Rank, and Maja Skovbjerg Knudsen.
