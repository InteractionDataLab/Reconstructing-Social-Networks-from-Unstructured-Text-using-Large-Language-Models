The Team
File:Teambilde.png
We are nine students from different study programmes that were brought together by our advisor, Eivind Almaas, to work on this project during the summer. Six of us are biotechnologists, so our team consists mainly of wetlab people. The last three students on the team have background in mathematics, physics and information technology, so we also have someone to take care of the modeling.
This is the first time a norwegian university is competing in iGEM, so we are all really happy to be on the first norwegian iGEM team ever.
None of us have been working much with synthetic biology before, so we are all leraning a lot. And since synthetic biology is a relatively new and very interesting field, we are all excited to get the opportunity to be learning more about the subject.
When we first got together, we came up with several projects we would like to work on. After a lot of discussion we decided to make the stress sensor, mainly because we all thought the idea was really cool, and because the stress sensor had more interesting modeling aproaches than the other projects we had thought about.  The stress sensor also seemed like a proper challenge, and since we all like a challenge, we went for it.
Until now, we've been having fun mainly on the lab, and not so much fun outside the lab, thanks to the crappy weather in Trondheim. Still, some days the weather has been nice, and on those days we have been barbecuing.
