LacI2 (BBa_K292006)
We found and orderd this part from the parts registry.  Since it had an RBS and double terminator it would save us from some cloning work.
When testcutting the constructs containing BBa_K292006 we got some unexpected results. Therefore we decided to digest the brick with three differnt enzymes with restriction sites  in the given biobrick-sequence in addition to EcoR1 and PstI (for looking at the biobrick length) Except from the sample cut with EcorR1 and PstI, the samples were also cut with BglI wich has a recognition site in the pSB1A2 backbone.
LacI2 plasmid cut with EcoR1 + PstI, BglI + BclI, BglI + EcoRV, BglI + BanII
Overwiev of restrctions and expected fragmentlengths:
Restriction enzymes
Expected lengths (bp)
EcoR1 + PstI
2053 (backbone) and 1303 (biobrick)
BglI + BclI
2032 + 1324
BglI + EcoRV
1760 + 1596
BglI + BanII
1835 + 1521
As we can see on the resulting gel none of the restriction sites inn the LacI2 fragment appear to be present. In additon the LacI2 insert looks smaller than it's supposed to be. This indicates that the biobrick sequence does not match the sequence given in the parts registry.
