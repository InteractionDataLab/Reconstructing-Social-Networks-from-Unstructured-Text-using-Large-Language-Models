Six of us study biotechnology, while the remaining three students on the team have background in mathematics, physics and information technology. This is the first time a university from Norway is competing in iGEM and we are all really happy to be part of this.
</P><P>Most of us have not been working too much with synthetic biology before, so the process have been very educational. Since synthetic biology is a relatively new and very interesting field, we are all excited to get the opportunity to learn more about the subject. When we first got together, we came up with several project ideas that we would like to work on. After a lot of discussion we decided to make the stress sensor, mainly because we all thought the idea was really cool, and because the stress sensor had more interesting modeling aproaches than the other projects we considered. The stress sensor also seemed like a proper challenge, and since we all like a challenge, we went for it.
</P><P>Until now, we've mostly been having fun in the lab. When the Trondheim weather permits it (which is not too often unfortunately), we try to take a break from the work and enjoy the summer and go barbequing. We have also arranged a street ping-pong tournament, the First international NTNU iGEM Street Ping-Pong Annual Tournament (FiNiSPPAT), which was won by Jon. Congratulations.
