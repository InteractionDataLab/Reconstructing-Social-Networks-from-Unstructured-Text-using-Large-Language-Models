Protocols
Resuspending DNA from registry-parts:
Poke a hole in foil of corresponding well.
Resuspend DNA in 10 µL dH2O (pipette up and down a few times)
Wait 5 minutes.
Transfer the resuspended DNA to a PCR tube and store in at -20°C.
Transforming competent cells:
Thaw competent cells on ice
Mix with 2 µL plasmid DNA
Incubate on ice 30 minutes
Heat-shock cells 45 seconds in 42°C water-bath.
Incubate 5 minutes on ice
Add 200 µL SOC
Incubate the Eppendorf tubes in Erlenmeyer flask 37°C shaking incubator for 2 hours
Plate 50 µl and 200 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread.
Incubate ON in 37°C
Isolating plasmids:
Inoculate one colony in 3 mL LB with appropriate antibiotic. (IE 1,5µL amp stock in 3 mL LB)
Grow in shaking incubator 30°C ON
Isolate plasmid using SV Miniprep procedure
Store in -20°C
Gel Extraction:
Using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit protocol
eluating with dH20
Restriction Digest:
Add 500ng of DNA to be digested, and adjust with dH20 for a total volume of 42.5 µl.
Add 5µl of NEBuffer 2 to the tube.
Add 0.5µl of BSA to the tube.
Add 1µl of your first enzyme.
Add 1µl of your second enzyme.
There should be a total volume of 50 µl. Mix well and spin down.
Incubate the restriction digest at 37°C for 30 min, and then 80°C for 20 min to heat kill the enzymes.
Ligation:
After digestion, separation, purification.
Add 11ul of dH20
Add 2ul from each sample you will be ligating (destination plasmid, and part)
Add 2ul of T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer
Add 1ul of T4 DNA Ligase
Mix well, and spin down.
Incubate for 30min at 16°C and 20min at 80°C to heat kill.
Use 2µl of ligation to transform into competent cells.
Alternatively:
After gel extraction:
Add 1 µL T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer
ca 6:1 molar ratio of insert to vector (~10ng vector)
Add (8.5 - vector and insert volume)μl
0.5 μL T4 Ligase
PCR
PCR mix:
Work on ice
0.5 µL DNA
5 µL 10x PCR buffer 2 (w/MgCl2)
0.5 µL 10 mM dNTPs
1 µL fwd primer
1 µL rev primer
0.5 µL polymerase
41.5 µL H20
PCR program:
Temperature of lid: 103°C
Heat cycles:
Initial denaturation: 94°C for 2 min
Denaturing: 94°C for 30 s
Annealing: 58°C for 30 s
Elongation: 72°C for 60 s
Repeat 2-4 34 times
Final elongation: 72C 7 min
Cooling: 4°C HOLD
Testing of construct
Test 1 Nullmedium:
Inoculate in 5 mL ON
Dillute 4 x 1:100 in LB, grow to OD 0,5
Pellet, resuspend 2x in 0,9% NaCl, 37°C, 2x in LB
Grow 3 hrs?
Test 2 Amino acid deprived:
Inoculate in 5 mL ON
Dillute 4 x 1:100 in LB, grow to OD 0,5
Pellet, resuspend 2x in no amino acid media, 37°C, 2x in LB
Grow 3 hrs?
Test 3 Temperature:
Inoculate in 5 mL ON
Dillute 6 x 1:100 in LB, grow to OD 0,5
Pellet, resuspend in LB, Incubate 2 x 25°C, 2 x 37°C, 2x 40°C ?
Grow 3 hrs?
Making blunt ends on DNA with sticky ends:
T4 DNA polymerase was used (Fills in 3' overhang and removes 5' overhang.
Digested DNA was cooled on ice, 2 µl 2 mM dNTP and 1 µl T4-DNA polymerase was added.
The mix was incubated at 16°C for 12 min.
Inactivate enzyme and isolate fragment by using PCR purification kit.
