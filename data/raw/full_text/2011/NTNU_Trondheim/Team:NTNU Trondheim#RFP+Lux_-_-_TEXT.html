TetR + p(TetR)+RFP (BBa_K092600) and TetR + p(TetR)+RFP+luxI (BBa_K092700)
At the beginning of the project our idea was to use this TetR regulated system to build the stress sensor. However our experience with the two biobricks is bad. Transformants did not show any signs of fluorescent activity, and the fragment lengths after enzyme digestion were not as expected.
