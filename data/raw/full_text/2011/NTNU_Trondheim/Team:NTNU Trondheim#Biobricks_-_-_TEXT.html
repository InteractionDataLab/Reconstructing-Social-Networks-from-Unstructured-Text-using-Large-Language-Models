Comment
P1
rrnB P1 promoter
BBa_K112118
BBb1 entry vector
Contains the rrnB P1 promoter, possibly also junk. Is in BBb format, not BBa, hence not compatible with other parts we are using. Repressible by ppGpp.
lambdaPR
lambda pR mod
BBa_R0051
pSB1A2
Strong promoter, based on lambda pR, repressible by ci, possibly ppGpp
RFP
TetR + p(TetR)+RFP
BBa_K092600
pSB1A2
RFP inhibited by tetR, RFP produced by neg. Promoter on TetR
Lux
TetR + p(TetR)+RFP+luxI
BBa_K092700
pSB1A2
Same as BBa_K092600, but with luxI in addition
lacP
lac Promoter (lacI regulated, lambda pL hybrid)
BBa_R0011
pSB1A2
Strong promoter, will be on in strains without lacI, off in strains that are lacIq and medium in strains that are lacI
lacI
lacI repressor from E. coli (+LVA)
BBa_C0012
pSB1A2
Coding region for the LacI protein with an LVA degradation tail and without an RBS. The LVA tag has been added for quicker degradation. Incompatible with systems containing LacI, lactose, or IPTG
mC
mCherry, bacterial with RBS and forward terminator
BBa_J06702
pSB1A2
mCherry, bacterial with RBS and forward terminator
lacI
lacI repressor with RBS
BBa_J24679
pSB1A2
RBS added to LacI protein coding region
TERM
Double terminator
BBa_B0015
pSB1AK3
Double terminator, wide usage.
Strong RBS + LacI(LVAtag) + double terminator
BBa_K292006
pSB1A2 ?
This part contains a strong ribosome binding site, the LacI repressor and a double terminator (BBa_B0030 + BBa_C0012 + BBa_B0014). This brick comes from the BBa_K292005.
GFP
GFP(+LVA)
BBa_K082003
pSB1AK3
GFP with degradation LVA tag
RBS
Ribosome Binding Site (strong)
BBa_B0034
pSB1A2
Varies from -6 to +1 region from original sequence to accomodate BioBricks suffix. Brukes i masse forskjellige constructs
TERM2
Double terminator
BBa_B0014
pSB1AK3
pBAD
Inducible pBad/araC promoter
BBa_I0500
pSB2K3
pBad is an E. coli promoter that is tightly controlled by:inducer: L-arabinose. Repressor: AraC apparently acts as the repressor.
pBAD2
Alternative  pBAD/araC
BBa_K113009
pSB1A2
Says BBa_I0050 doesn't work, made new pBAD/AraC
GFP2
Alternative GFP without LVA tag
BBa_E0040
pSB1A2
GFP ssra
Alternative GFP with degradation tag
BBa_E0044
pSB1A3
LacZ
Beta Lactamase + RBS and double terminator
BBa_I732019
BBa_I732950
