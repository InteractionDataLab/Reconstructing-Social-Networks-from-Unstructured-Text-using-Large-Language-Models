WEEK 6
Engineering:Finally we decide to buy a functional motor and try to assemble it with the pump. The first bacteriocins separator module is built with a small container (a hair wax box) and a couple of toric joints. The cost is around 5 euros. Take a look to the pictures, is awesome, isn’t it?  We found a dialysis membrane that could work properly to homogenize the pH.
pH-stat: We began the first simultaneous experiment with the established cultures:
1. Bottle 1 is placed under continuous light for 24 hours to observe the evolution of the pH.
2. Bottle 2 is left under the same conditions and a 12h/12h photoperiod.
Initially bottle 1 was 7.63 and bottle 2 was   7.59   but after two days, contrary to expectations, the pH had dropped to 6.56 and 6.23 respectively. So, besides the decrease of pH, the light cycle disorder caused severe damage in the culture, reducing drastically the concentration of Synechocystis. We therefore concluded that the first experiment was a failure.
Colicin production: We have sent some e-mails, expecting some experienced researchers to help us with the use of bacteriocins in our experiments. Now to wait for answers!
