WEEK 3
Engineering: The material used in laboratories is normaly quite  expensive, so we engineers put our mind to  to find cheaper solutions. The first draft for our machine has been made. The corresponding membranes for bacteriocins separation are donated from a department from our university and the first experiments are done. Thanks a lot!!!
pH-stat: We arranged the work surface for the culture of Synechocystis in the laboratory with capacity  to perform two simultaneous experiments.
Colicin production: After choosing the project, we start documenting about antimicrobial peptides and possible candidates to use in our project. How to get them? Where to ask? ....
