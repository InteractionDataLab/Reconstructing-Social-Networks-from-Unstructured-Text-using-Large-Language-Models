WEEK 2
Engineering: We think it will be perfect if we build a prototype which is able to work autonomously. So we have started to search literature and talk with experts in membranes technologies.    We  have prepared some mathematical models in order to describe our system. From now on, the brainstorming and associate ideas is our way to survive.
pH-stat: We uses all time for obtain materials and devise the photobioreactor assembly.
