WEEK 4
Engineering: We literally beg in different institutions in order to find a peristaltic pump and a membrane to homogenize the pH between different flasks. Finally we found a peristaltic pump that was used in an old hemodialysis machine. Thanks to the hospital!!!!!
pH-stat: The containers to be used was prepared and sterilized for the experimental implementation of the first culture, consisting of two 330 ml bottles with a concentration of fertilizer 1 ml / l distilled water, a  12h/12h photoperiod.
Supervision of the evolution of pH and cellular concentration in our cultures, who started working well, increasing the number of cells / ml and the absorbance data was taken at 440 nm.
Colicin production: We found that antimicrobial peptides such as defensines bring difficulties. We decide it would be better to opt for bacteriocins, easier to manage and control. We begin to document about them.
