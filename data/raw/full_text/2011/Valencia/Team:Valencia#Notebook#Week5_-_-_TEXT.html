WEEK 5
Engineering: The original motor of the peristaltic pump is not working. We spent a lot of time trying to fix it, but without finding the right solution. The first ideas arise for the bacteriocins separator module. You can find one for around 1000 euros, too much for us.
pH-stat: We monitored the evolution of culture, counting daily the number of cells and measuring the absorbance. We observed how the culture tends to grow, increasing the number of cells and absorbance twins.
Colicin production: We continue searching and putting us in touch with Scientifics who work with bacteriocins. Our ideal bacteriocin should have different activity in different pH ranges.
