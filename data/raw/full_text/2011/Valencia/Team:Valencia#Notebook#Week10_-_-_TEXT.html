WEEK 10
Engineering: In this week we have ended the temperature control system by covering our ceramic heating with a copper casing. We have put all the cables inside the tightbox and ensure that there is no risk by using the machine.
pH-stat: Implementation of six new cultures in 80 ml flasks in which growing conditions vary, such as light intensity (with or without reflector/spotlight), water used (either  distilled ,tap  or analytical ) and the presence or absence of  a  magnetic  stirrer.
The objective  of this experiment is to check which the ideal are growing conditions for the culture, since so far, all crops have ended up prematurely. The results from this time  on are already included in the  on pH-stat  section.
Colicin production: Finally got the bacteriocin-producing strains! Now begins our investigation (a little too late). GOOD LUCK! Our Escherichia coli strains produce bacteriocins colG and col H. Now we search the best culture medium to work with them. Seeing that they don’t have resistances to any antibiotic, we decide to use a selective medium such as “Chrom ID coli” for our cultures.
