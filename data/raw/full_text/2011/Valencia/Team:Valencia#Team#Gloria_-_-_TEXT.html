Hello, I’m Gloria, Ph.D in Organic Chemistry and Professor at Universidad Católica de Valencia.  My research studies span natural products, synthesis and reactivity of organic compounds as well as theoretical and computational chemistry, like in molecules classification with topological, geometrical and chemico-physical descriptors in order to predict properties and activities of drugs and natural products.
