WEEK 9
Engineering: We have started to set all instruments in a unique frame. So the prototype starts to have a shape.  We built a thermostat with electronics, so we can keep the E. Coli growing up at 37 ºC.
pH-stat: We removed the light reflector / spotlight. We also added  fertilizer to the cultures we had set up the previous week  to see if they would improve, but after a  week they all went worse and we rejected them.
Colicin production: We don't know which medium would be the best for our bacteriocin-producing strains, so we prepare a basic medium such as LB.
