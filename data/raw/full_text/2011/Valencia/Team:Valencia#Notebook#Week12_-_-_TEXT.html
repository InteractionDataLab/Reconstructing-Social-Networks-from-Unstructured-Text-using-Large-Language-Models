WEEK 12
Engineering: The prototype is finished and we are doing several trials to check that everything goes properly and yes it does!
pH-stat: There was a large increase in the concentration of Synechocystis, especially in flasks 5 and 6, but also contamination from other microorganisms.
We started two new 80 ml cultures to which 2 ml of fertilizer to each one was added. They finally began to develop favourably, increasing their concentration and also we could see a vast majority of growing cells  against the cells which are not reproducing.
Once we obtained and established the culture under laboratory conditions, we measured the change in pH. Since the 24 hour light  had caused serious damage to the culture, we measured the pH changes that occurred each hour in photoperiods of 4 hours of light and 4 of darkness.
Colicin production: We start growing the E.coli with microcin C51 in LB medium with ampicilin. And we perform a viable count and a plasmid extraction too.
