Water Colicin Cleaner: disinfected water by E. coli
Water Colicin Cleaner is a biological alternative for disinfecting contaminated water using synthetic biology. We kill targeted pathogens by means of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli. As a proof of concept we have chosen to aim for enterobacteria, focusing on E. coli contaminated water, as a proxy of fecal water. The cleaning of E. coli will be possible thanks to the colicin protein. The activity of these proteins will be controlled by a biological pH-stat, using light-driven cyanobacteria to control pH of the media.  We will deliver a DIY kit as a prototype platform for killing pathogens responsible of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and typhoid fever, ending with more than 2 million deaths in the last year according to the 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality.  W.C. Cleaner is an effective, low-cost device, that will help people that struggle to find pathogen-free drinking water avoid important diseases.
