WEEK 11
Engineering: The apparatus is almost finished. We are now concentrated on the decoration of the artifact
pH-stat: The evolution of the six cultures this week was not what we expected either, although  culture number 6   with  analytical water  and without reflector survived  better. We suspected that it was not performing as expected  because of  the concentration of fertilizer, so  by the end of the week, seeing that they were few cells  left , instead of  rejecting them, we added 2 ml of fertilizer per flask to  see if that could provoke  an increase  by  the following Monday.
Colicin production: First, we grow the E. coli carrying the bacteriocins (col G et H). We also perform a viable count for each strain, to see their productivity.  Now we start thinking of ways to quantify or purify the bacteriocins. We also perform a plasmid extraction on both strains. We receive another bacteriocin! (microcin C51). Thanks to Inna! We note that, ended the summer holidays, we are receiving almost everything we needed. The problem is we are running short of time!
