Designed and developed a ready-to-use low-cost disinfection system , which can be done in your own garage.
Valencia iGEM Team 2011 has tamed Colicin G and H and Microcin parts and sent them to the Registry .
We have successfully produced and used Colicin G and H and Microcin in order to kill pathogens.
We have tested and proven under what conditions the culture of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is more feasible and has a higher concentration with low-cost material.
We have tested pH variations on the environment caused by the irradiance of protons and growth of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803
We have accomplished to grow Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 on a low-cost photobioreactor under laboratory conditions.
Valencia iGEM 2011 has performed an outstanding work on Human Practices regarding the design, development and use of an ethically arousing project like this one .
Students have carried all the weight of the project. Faculty was contacted when we had to decide on a project and advisor were seldom bumped with issues and doubts, but all the results, conclusion and works have been done by students.
Finally, we think we fulfill all the requirements in order to have a Gold Medal.
