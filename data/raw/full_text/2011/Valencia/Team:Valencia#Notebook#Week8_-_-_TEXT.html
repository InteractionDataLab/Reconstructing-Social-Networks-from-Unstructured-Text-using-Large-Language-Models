WEEK 8
Engineering: We found a better solution for the bacteriocins separator module. It works, but we still have in mind to find a more efficient solution.  We built the magnetic mixers with a computer fan and the magnets from the hard disk. We have realized how under pressure you can find different innovative solutions.
pH-stat: The cultures of the previous week were colourless, and we also found out  with  a microscope that they had no living cells. So, two new cultures with the same characteristics were set up. The day after ,we could observe that there was no cell growth, but a concentration decrease. The causes were not well known . It is suspected that the inactivity of the culture  might  be due to  these facts:
1. The room temperature  had not  been  constant, varying  from 30 °  at room temperature  to  22 º C  at refrigeration temperature.
2. The concentration of fertilizer was  not enough to motivate the proliferation.
3.The excess of light caused by the two  tubes plus the reflector / spotlight  caused photoinhibition (Portilla, A. et. Al., 2009).
Colicin production: We finally purchase two bacteriocin-producing strains at Health Protection Agency.
