WEEK 7
Engineering: We discovered that we are really good handymen. The pump is assembled with a Windscreen wiper motor, and it is working perfectly. Hard work!!! The bacteriocins separator module is tested with the pump, but it cannot hold the pressure and breaks. We were expecting something like that. Damn!!!! We want to work with clean energy. So we contacted a solar energy company, who sponsors us with the donation of a solar panel. Nice trip with the van to pick it up.
pH-stat: Two new cultures were set   so as  to retake  the pH experiments with the same conditions as the first one, but during this week as  it was the World Youth Day (WYD), the Catholic University of Valencia, home to the  experiments with Synechocystis, closed its doors  on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to their workers in order to serve as  a host for the people who  was coming  to Madrid to see  the Pope, so, we could not add any  fertilizer or perform any maintenance control during that week.
Colicin production: We are experiencing that August is a slow month, most people go on vacation and we only get answer to one e-mail. A nice response from a Russian group. It’s not enough so we start thinking about purchasing E. coli strains with bacteriocins.
