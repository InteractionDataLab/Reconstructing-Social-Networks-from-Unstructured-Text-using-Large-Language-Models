- Yeasts haven't grown yet.
- iGEM meeting.
August 4th
Today we have had a yeast-team meeting. We suspect that our yeasts are not growing because they died during the trip between Barcelona and Valencia. We have decided to spread the yeasts we have left in YPD medium that had already been prepared, but we are skeptical about the results. If it doesn't work, Joaquin Arinyo and his teammates will send us more aequorin-transformed yeasts.
We have also made 1 liter of newn solid SD lacking Leu medium.
August 5th
Today we have prepared the Coelenterazine stock dissolution. First we "put" N2 gas through a Methanol dissolution in order to substitute the O2, an inhibitor for the coelenterazine. After 5 or 10 minutes we took 200 microL and added them to 50 microg of Coelenterazine.
Then we have distribute them in eppendorfs of 5 microL each and kept them in the fridge at -20º.
For other side, we doubt if our yeast in the YPD medium have grown or not... We think we should wait until tomorrow... T-T... Like Cristina says, our yeasts are like Peter Pan: they don't want to grow up...
We had no results, not even in the possitive control. Our annealing temperature was not aproppiate.
Back to July    |    August    |    Go to September
You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook.  This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer.  It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
