Miguel Pitarch Mocholí
Hi everybody!!! I’m Miguel, I was in the 2009 Valencia iGEM Team. The experience was so good that I’m really happy to repeat it again. Currently I’m studying a master degree in Mechanical Engineering. I like iGEM because to bring out a project with limited resources you have to let your creativity flows and work as a handyman.  If you want know more about me don’t be shy and ask me in the European meeting or maybe in the MIT.
Helena Sáez Pérez
Hi colleges!! I am a biologist, specializing mainly in the field of molecular biology. I knew the project was to take place this year, which is very interesting, I think, so I'm really pleased to participate. I hope to take advantage of this experience, both technical and personal.  Bachelor’s in Biology, University of Valencia
Maria Mossi Vila
Hello, my name is Maria and I am a student of marine science in UCV from Valencia (Spain). I wanted to participate in the IGEM because I had much attention and great enthusiasm to create new tools that can help us in future to improve our circumstances. I also seemed very interesting to work with students from other scientific branches.
David Hervás Marín
Hello, I'm a biologist specialized in genetics. Currently I'm studying a master degree in Biostatistics. I like developing new ideas and thinking of original ways to solve problems, so when my friend David Fuente told me about iGEM it was a no-brainer to join the team. See you in Amsterdam!
David Fuente Herraiz
Hi, I'm a chemical engineer with some experience in industrial processes and separation operations. I'm now studying a master course in Biostatistics. I like interdisciplinar projects, so iGEM is a unique opportunity to lock together different degree students in a room to see what comes out from it! I have learned a lot and if possible I would like to repeat the experience next year. Enjoy and good luck for everyone!
Juan Ricardo Ortíz Meneses
Hello world scientists.  My name is Juan Ricardo and I am studing Biotechnology at the Catholic University of Valencia, UCV (Valencia Spain). I think it's important to create useful applications using knowledge from different scientific fields. I love to read scientific articles, roller-skating to release adrenaline, playing guitar, singing, listening rock music and travel doing gastronomic and cultural tourism. I hope the project we decided to develop this year to disinfect contaminated water will improve the quality of life of living beings that inhabit this world.
Marina Sanz Martín
I'm Marina and I'm oceanographer, I had studied Marine Sciences. I would like focus my work to study environmental pollution. When I heard about iGEM, I thought that it was a great opportunity to join efforts and knowledge to other students to improve the environment and solve huge problems by this tool: Sythetic biology!
Lluís Gimeno Giménez
Hi, I'm Lluís Gimeno, Marine Science student at the Catholic University of Valencia. I'm excited to share knowledge and have been part of a group of research work. I'm delighted to be able to participate in this competition and to share new experiences, with all the people that we have to know both my colleagues.
Beatriz Salesa Landete
Hi guys!! I'm an oceanographer, and I love everything about the marine world. This year I had the opportunity to join the group Valencia iGEM 2011 and I didn't think the least because I knew this experience would be incredible. I hope all our efforts have paid off and our project as the basis for a good solution to the problem of water in many parts of the world. See you soon!
Maria Siurana
Hello people! I'm a Chemical Engineer. This is my second iGEM and I am as thrilled as the first one. See you all out here!
