Team:WHU-China/Acknowledgement
From 2011.igem.org
   WHU_iGEM team is the first time to participate the iGEM competition. Our project is about light sensing systems. But our college does little research on this filed. Luckily, we got a lot help from our instructors and other iGEM teams. Here we would like to give our sincere thanks to all of you. Thank you very much and wish you iGEM teams get good results.
Instructors
During this summer, our two instructors gave us a lot of help. They did not help us do experiments. But without their good suggestions, good instructions and also the laboratory's supporting, we could not carry out our projects.
iGEM_11 Team-Edinburgh
They sent us materials of green light sensing and reporting parts. List: 1. lac promoter plus repaired phycobilin synthesis operon(ho1 + pcyA), in pSB1C3. 2. green light sensor, with and without lac promoter, in pSB1C3. 3. PhoA promoter with lacZ'alpha and mCherry reporter genes, in pSB1C3. 4. CcaRS DNA, sent by Mexico - it appears that this is a PCR product, not a plasmid.
iGEM_11 Team-HUST-China
They gave us the BBa_I15010, as ours was identified as void-vector.
iGEM_11 Team-UNAM-Genomics_Mexico
They sent us materials of blue light sensing and reporting parts. List: 1. part BBa_K360123 in plasmid pSB1c3. 2. part BBa_K360129 in plasmid pSB3k3. 3. part BBa_K360129 in plasmid J61002 (or J61003). 4. part BBa_K360129 in plasmid pSB1c3. 5. The TrpR(-) E.coli strain.
iGEM_11 Team-UANL_Mty-Mexico
They sent us materials of green and red light sensing and reporting parts. List: Plasimds: pJT106, pJT116, pJT118, pJTPCB, pJT106b, pJTCph8, pJT122. E.coli strains: 1. JT2-pJT106,pCph8. 2. JT2-pJT106,pJT122. 3. JT2-pJT122. 4. JT2-pJT122,pPLPCB(S)
Our Help to Other iGEM Team
iGEM_11 Team-XMU-China
This summer we have made good relationship with iGEM Team XMU_China. We sent them backbone plasmid with chloramphenicol resistance gene and bacteria with it. These helped them to build the new biobricks and also other experiments. Details: https://2011.igem.org/Team:XMU-China/Human_Practice Furthermore, we have got some help from iGEM Team XMU_China. They gave us many useful suggestions.
