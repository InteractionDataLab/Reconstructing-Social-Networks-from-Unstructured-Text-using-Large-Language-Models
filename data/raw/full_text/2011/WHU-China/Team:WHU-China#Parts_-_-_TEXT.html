     This is the favourite biobrick submitted by us this year. We have already finished construction of many new biobricks and devices, but due to some problems encountered in the experiments and the lack of time, we fail to put them on the vector with chloramphenicol resistance.      This is a complete blue light sensing and expressing system. When exposed to blue light, the blue-light sensor will inhibit PtrpL, which in turn hinders the expression of RFP. As a result, the RFP won’t be accumulated in the E.coli, and the colonies will not be red. However, when blue light is absent, the inhibition on the ptrpL will be released, so E.coli will express RFP smoothly and become red.      To achieve the optimal effect, you’d........
