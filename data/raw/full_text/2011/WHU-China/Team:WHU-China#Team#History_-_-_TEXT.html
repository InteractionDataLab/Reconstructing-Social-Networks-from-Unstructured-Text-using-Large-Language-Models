    We are not the first iGEM team in Wuhan university, but the first iGEM team to participate the competition. The former iGEM team of Wuhan university was started by Shijie Zou in November 2009.Most members come from the College of Life Science and one student from the College of Math. Despite our endearvour to understand the principles of synthesis biology, we did not not convince our college to support us to compete in iGEM. Missing the 2010 iGEM, we did not give up. In April 4th 2010, we established our new team with student from College of Life Science and College of Math. Furthermore we recruit new members from the College of Computer and Software. Together with those new peers, we began to study the previous projects in iGEM history as well as research papers in synthetic biology. After 4 months brainstorm we successfully came up with four projects and two of them passed the oral presentation in our college. In March 24, 2011, we established our team in the iGEM competition with instructors: Dean Jianbo Wang, Professor Zhixiong Xie. Professor Xiufen Zou and team leaders: Chao Zhang, Jing You. We began our pre-experiments from March 29th.     In April and May, we establised our first iGEM experiment platform. In July till now we worked on our project using biobricks and other biological parts. We have spent a busy summer full of happiness and joy.
