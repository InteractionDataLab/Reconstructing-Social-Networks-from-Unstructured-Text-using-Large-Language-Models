            synthetic biology where not only existing 
            genes are described and analyzed but also 
            new gene arrangements can be constructed            and evaluated.”
            --Waclaw Szybalski </EM></H2><P> </P><P class="stuff">February 2011 found a computer lab full of enthusiastic  Rutgers students that were to comprise the Rutgers iGEM team. Young, naïve,  ignorant students of science they were, not one could answer the question “What  is synthetic biology?” Indeed, it took spring, summer, and fall, nights  programming on a computer, days miniprepping in a lab, and constant doodling on  a drawing board before they would truly find out. Synthetic biology, a simple  phrase that is yet not so simple to understand. In his video “Defining  Synthetic Biology”, Drew Endy defines synthetic biology as “an approach”. While  it uses different tools and principles of genetic engineering, molecular  biology, and microbiology, it goes beyond these fields to present a new way to  look at the possibilities of biology.</P><P class="stuff">
              One of  the reasons, we realized, that we didn’t truly understand synthetic biology it  wasn’t something that was yet truly taught in the classroom. While we learned  about basic techniques of genetic engineering, like gel electrophoresis, PCR,  and bacterial transformations, we never really put it all together. We had the  tools but we were never really told how to use them to construct something  bigger. </P><P class="stuff">
              As we  enter a “new era of synthetic biology”, the fact that many students still don’t  understand its concepts is a problem. Our project of creating complex circuits in bacteria merges the fields of synthetic biology and technology in ways that years ago may not have been possible. Our project shows the forthcoming emergence of new approaches to biology and technology, yet by not introducing synthetic biology to our generation, are we leaving them behind? While we worked on our project, we realized that the novelty of our project would have no future if coming scientists and citizens didn't understand its implications and the implications synthetic biology has for how we will live in the future. The fields of science and synthetic  biology are rapidly evolving and uncovering new questions and problems. Are we  preparing our generation and the next to meet the challenge of this “new era”?  The Rutgers iGEM team decided to take this human practice matter into its own  hands.</P><P class="stuff"> </P><H2><EM>“The secret of genius is to carry 
              the spirit of childhood into maturity.”
                  
                --Aldous Huxley </EM></H2><P> </P><P>Synthetic biology is novel.  It’s developing. It opens the mind to new possibilities and gives us the tools  to make them realities. It builds off of a sort of creativity that isn’t  traditionally taught in a science class. We decided to take this concept of  imagination and synthetic biology to the community and to especially reach out  to the kids of New Jersey. We wanted to show them that synthetic biology can be  FUN!</P><P>
              At Rutgers Day, a fun-filled day where Rutgers  opens its campus to showcase to New Jersey its forthcoming research, teaching,  and involvement with the community, we decided to reach out to the kids of New  Jersey and introduce them to synthetic biology. We set up a station where we  showcased a poster and concept maps of our projects. We also had pictures of  different bacteria and an interactive activity for the children.</P><P>
              We started off by asking the children what they knew  about bacteria. Most of the younger children had a vague idea of bacteria as  germs that were ‘bad for you’. Middle school and high school students had a  better idea of the structures of bacteria. We showed pictures of bacteria and  explained how bacteria were actually found everywhere and could be ‘good’ as  well by serving various functions. We then went on to explain DNA and its  role in not just humans but all forms of life. By leading up to synthetic  biology by first explaining these simple concepts, we were able to help  children gain an understanding of the foundations of synthetic biology.</P><P>
              We then explained synthetic biology as an approach of  using genetic engineering to construct new genetic combinations with new  functions. While most people had heard about genetic engineering, they only  vaguely understood it as something that was done to food, or something that  could alter animals, or something very sci-fi. By breaking synthetic biology  down to the DNA level and explaining Biobricks and standardized parts, we were  able to turn synthetic biology into a simple concept that children and adults  alike could abstract. </P><P>
              To engage kids in thinking creatively about synthetic  biology, we asked them ‘If you could make a <EM>superbacteria</EM>,  what super power would it have?’ Though a simple and very childlike question on  the surface, we found that asking ourselves similar questions helped us think  of synthetic biology creatively and dynamically, and eventually led to the  development of our iGEM projects. Through bacterial ‘parts’ of pipe cleaners,  construction paper, markers, and other crafty odds and ends, we watched as the  kids of New Jersey created all kinds of unique ‘superbacteria’. This activity  not only introduced synthetic biology to the children in our community, but  opened their minds to question and think of solutions to problems using  synthetic biology. By planting the seeds of inspiration and creativity in  children and introducing them to the scientific tools that could make their  ideas a reality, we hope to prepare the coming generation for the “new era of  synthetic biology”.</P><P> </P><H2><EM>“We cannot always build the future for our youth, 
              but we can build our youth for the future.”             
              --Franklin D. Roosevelt</EM></H2><P> </P><P>As college students preparing  for the workforce and our role in society, we know the value of inspiration and  outreach. Many of us wanted to scientists, doctors, or engineers. As we grew  older, we all had certain experiences that shaped our decisions for the future,  be it that cool biology teacher that made us want to do research or that  awesome biomedical engineering professor that showed us there was more to  engineering than just computers. The earlier we were introduced to a field, the  more time we had to learn about it and whether we wanted to be a part of it.  Often, we were able to make connections between seemingly unrelated fields and  see how they intersected in the real world. We decided we wanted students to be  aware about synthetic biology early. While many children grow up hearing about  traditional scientific fields, it’s not until late college or much later that  they realize the different fields available in science. We decided to reach out  to the high school and college community and introduce students to synthetic  biology.</P><P>
  To reach out to high school students, we went to the  New Jersey Governor’s School in the Sciences, a summer program for talented  high school students that broadens their view of the sciences. RU iGEMmers explained synthetic biology, the iGem competition,  and our projects. By introducing high school students to synthetic biology we  hope to broader their knowledge and understanding of science and open their  minds to new possibilities in science and their future roles in the scientific  community.</P><P>
  In addition to high school students, we reached out  to college students at the Rutgers University student involvement fair. At this  fair, we presented the iGEM team and our projects to hundreds of Rutgers  students. Many of these students had come in to Rutgers with an idea that they  wanted to study the sciences but weren’t aware of the various fields  that the sciences encompassed. By explaining synthetic biology and the iGEM  competition we showed college students a different side of science and  engineering. Judging by the numerous pages of contact information of students  interested in the Rutgers iGEM team, our outreach to college students was a  success.</P><P> </P><H2><EM>“I am not concerned that we will run 
  out of exciting and novel ideas...
in the synthetic biology, in general.”
----Waclaw Szybalski</EM></H2><P> </P><P>Synthetic biology is a new, exciting,  and developing field that will play a great role in our world in the future. By  introducing synthetic biology to children and youth, we are preparing our  generation and the next to engage with and contribute to this future. In this  rapidly developing scientific age, we need synthetic biological literacy to be  more mainstream, not only for budding scientists, but for future activists,  educators, policy makers, and other individuals that will play a critical role  in synthetic biology’s future. Through our outreach programs we hope we were  able to inspire and educate our community about synthetic biology. More importantly,  we hope and invite other iGEMmers, scientists, and citizens of the biological  world to help inspire and educate the future of tomorrow.</P><P class="stuff"> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><DIV class="printfooter">
