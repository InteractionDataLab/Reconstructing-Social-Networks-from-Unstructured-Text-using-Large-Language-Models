RUigem biosafety in the lab
Waksman institute of microbiology
Our experimental lab  work this summer took place at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology on the  UMDNJ campus at Rutgers University. This building is named in honor of Dr.  Selman Waksman who was a soil microbiologist and a professor at Rutgers for  four decades. In 1952, Dr. Waksman received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or  Medicine for his discovery of streptomycin, which is isolated from Streptomyces  griseus. This discovery led to his coining of the term "antibiotic.”
 
Following this  discovery and the application of streptomycin as broad range antibiotic,  questions regarding the resistance of bacteria in the presence of an antibiotic  arose. Consequently, biological safety precautions had to be reevaluated to  better reduce hazards and risks in the laboratory. 
 
We believe that adherence  to good laboratory practice is beneficial to many, not just the researcher.  These qualities can help to avoid errors, allow for experimental procedures to  be consistently repeated, and aids in the credibility of the work to others.  Throughout the summer, we have carefully worked with Escherichia coli strain DH5a (Genotype: fhuA2Δ(argF-lacZ)U169 phoA glnV44 Φ80 Δ(lacZ)M15  gyrA96 recA1 relA1 endA1 thi-1 hsdR17), various antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin), chemical  reagents and hazardous material. Our safety regulation and laboratory  responsibilities included careful labeling schemes, detailed documentation and  a cleaning routine of laboratory bench tops before and after work sessions.  Waste collection and disposal for specific hazards was also carefully  regulated.
 
 
safety questions
Our iGEM projects involve the construction of gene regulatory networks that utilize positive and negative feedback loops found in microorganisms. The circuits we have proposed are made up of genetic devices such as transcriptional regulators (activator and repressor proteins) and reporter genes.
In the duration of our project we did not come across any DNA BioBricks that could cause pathogenic harm to the researchers, the public or the environment.Rutgers Environmental Health and Safety regulates protocols and waste disposal methods used by federally funded research projects. (REHS, http://rehs.rutgers.edu/lsbio_comm.html)
 
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues  in terms of?
Researcher Safety
Use of hazardous chemicals: Ethidium Bromide (EtBr)
Public Safety
None
Environmental Safety?
None
Security Threats?
None
Our projects are involved with logic circuits and light detection. By themselves they pose no risk to anyone. 
 
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
For the parts that are  already in the registry no safety issues have been encountered.  The two BioBrick parts we are creating from scratch  are transcriptional regulators which should not raise any safety issues.
 
3. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?
Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they? Provide a link to them online if possible.
Rutgers Environmental Health and Safety (REHS) regulates protocols and waste disposal methods used by federally funded research projects. (REHS:http://rehs.rutgers.edu/lsbio_comm.html)
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
REHS provides oversight and training for various hazards such as medical waste, hazardous waste, and radioactive waste. Dr Vershon, our PI, reviewed our project for possible safety issues; he did not find any. He also informed us of the labs procedures for disposing waste and general safety procedures. 
The procedures have all been reviewed by REHS and are approved under the Recombinant DNA RD-00-029 (11/28/2000 – 12/31/2015) issued to Dr. Vershon by REHS.
Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if possible.
Yes, the NIH has guidelines for biosafety available here: http://oba.od.nih.gov/oba/rac/guidelines_02/NIH_Gdlnes_lnk_2002z.pdf
 
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
If extra money is available, Crystal Violet and other dyes are much safer and more accurate alternatives to EtBr.
Come up with an alternative to Bleach to clean out E.Coli from the sink and waterways.
Use autoclavable/sterile materials instead of gratuitous amounts of plastic every day.
Software Approach:
Software that scans bricks for potentially hazardous DNA sequences
Software that calculates risk of mutation that could create a potentially hazardous DNA sequence.
Future plugin for MYSIS that can output a protocol to insert any genetic ‘watermark’ via site-directed mutagenesis
 
 
general laboratory rules
guidelines
No eating,  drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics, etc. in the lab. 
Access to  the laboratory is restricted to only when Dr. Vershon or Dr. Mead from the Vershon  lab is present. 
Please do  not bring friends into the lab (Dr. Vershon has our roster. If we add new  members we will okay it with him before they are allowed in the lab).
Work areas  should be cleaned after any chemical spill.
Mechanical  pipeting devices are always used.  Mouth  pipeting is not permitted.
Hands  should be washed before and after working in the laboratory.
Disposable  gloves should be worn when working with hazardous chemicals such as EtBr.  Lab coats must be worn in the lab to protect  your street clothes from contamination.  Lab coats should not be worn outside of the laboratory. 
Shorts and  sandals are not permitted in the lab.
Waste must  be disposed of properly (see Waste Disposal on p.1-5).
Sterility/aseptic techniques
Pipette tip boxes and  microfege tube bags must always be tightly closed.
Media and reagent  bottles must always be capped tightly.
Common courtesy
If you are using Dr.  Vershon’s supplies (i.e. media, plates, reagents) always inform someone when  supplies are very low. Don’t take the last bottle!
Help out making media  when requested.
Sterile solutions should  not be returned to the general stocks.

storage and saving
Incubator (37 C)
Plates should  be incubated agar side up, properly labeled and documented in the lab  notebook!
Liquid  cultures should be tightly capped, properly labeled and  documented in the lab notebook!
Turn on  shaker after taking off your samples!
Turn off  light after leaving the room.
Room temperature (20 C - 25 C)
DNA Kit  (with lyophilized DNA)
Ethanol
Concentrated  Buffers
Refridgerator (4 C)
Plates (agar  side up, properly labeled and documented in the lab notebook!)
Liquid  cultures (tightly  capped, properly labeled and documented in the lab notebook!)
DNA (i.e. un-lyophilized  DNA)
Buffers
Media
Freezer (-20 C)
Most  restriction enzymes (always read the label!)
Low-temperature Freezer (-80 C)
Frozen  cultures (properly labeled and documented in the lab notebook!)         
Light sensitive
Tetracycline  is light sensitive and should be saved in the refridgerator with foil around it  and tape.
If a bottle  is brown, it is light sensitive and should stay this way.
Cleaning  up
Generally, make sure everything in the lab is in order. Cover things  so they may not collect dust. Always close pipet tip boxes and bags with  microfuge tubes to maintain their sterility. Keep autoclaved bottles tightly closed.
Glassware. All tubes must be washed out in Waksman Room 234. Place the glass tube  and the cap in its appropriate basket.
Disposables. If it’s made out of plastic and you do not need it, it’s probably  garbage. Make sure before throwing out tubes that you are absolutely sure you  don’t need it. If you are continuing someone elses experiment and/or you are  not sure whether to save the tube, save, label and store it in the refrigerator  just in case.
Refrigerator/freezers. All refrigerator/freezer contents must be  labeled properly and documented in the lab notebook. Tape plates together if  they are related. Try not to tape only one side of the stack because if it  falls apart or just falls, it gets messy. Reuse tape when you can and again,  label the tape. All tubes must be capped tightly.
Biohazard (E. coli). Add (a small amount) of chlorine bleach to  waste containers and let it sit for a bit before discarding it down the  sink. 
The drawers are now labeled with respect to their contents, please  keep them this way. The window should be shut completely if you have opened it.  Place all books back on the shelf. Place all lab notebooks and protocols in the  brown binder. Wipe the bench with some ethanol at the end of the day.
