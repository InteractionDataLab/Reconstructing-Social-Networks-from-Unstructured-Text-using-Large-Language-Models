This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. In particular, the bacteria need to be sensitive </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">enough </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">to respond to a short light pulse from a laser, but still “selective” to </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">not respond to</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> ambient lighting. We have designed a novel genetic switch </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">to</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">large</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> signal amplification. For example, researchers creating biosensors may find our work very helpful.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3 c10">General Overview</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        Our project can be broken down into three parts: light input, signal amplification, and color output. We used </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">LovTAP</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> to receive the light input; we designed a switch based on Peking 2007’s Bi-stable switch to amplify the signal; and, finally, (after dabbling with some of Cambridge 2009’s E. Chromi colors) we decided to use mRFP1 as a color output. </SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c10 c3">LovTAP</SPAN></P><P class="c13 c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Overview</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c1">In order to draw on a bacterial</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> lawn</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> with a laser pointer, we need bacteria to be able to respond to light. Previous iGEM teams have worked on many different ways to do this each with different advantages and disadvantages. We were struck by the simplicity and beauty of LovTAP. In particular, it functions by itself as a single protein; </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">it is a brilliant</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> example of genetic engineering</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">; and, finally, it does not require any </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">exotic</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> supplements or specific strains of bacteria to function. </SPAN></P><P class="c5 c13"><SPAN class="c1 c3">LovTAP Parts</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c1">As mentioned previously, LovTAP is a fusion protein. It consists of a light-response domain and a DNA binding domain</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">, each of which are parts of other natural proteins.</SPAN></P><P class="c13 c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Light response</SPAN></P><P class="c13 c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">        </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">The light-response domain is LOV2, the photoactive domain (i.e. the light responsive part) of AsLOV2 (</SPAN><SPAN class="c1 c8">Avena sativa</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> phototropin 1). AsLOV2 is a protein which allows </SPAN><SPAN class="c1 c8">Avena sativa </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">to respond to 470 nm light. It does this by undergoing a major conformational change upon being struck by a photon with a wavelength near 470 nm. The absorption of the photon leads to the formation of a covalent bond between a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and a conserved cysteine residue. This new bond distorts the conformation of the protein, causing the detachment and unfolding of the Jα-helix (see figure X). In natural AsLOV2, the unfolding of the Jα-helix results in further </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">downstream signalling.</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> However, we will be most interested in the fact that the Jα-helix detaches when LOV2 is hit by blue light.</SPAN></P><P class="c13 c5"><SPAN class="c1">Figure X.

Strickland et al.’s idea was to force them to “fight over”</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">a single alpha helix. Thus, since LOV2 has a higher affinity for the helix in the dark than trpR, there is no trpR activity in the dark. However, </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">when exposed to</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> light, LOV2 releases the alpha helix, allowing trpR to bind it and, thus, result in trpR activity (which of course is repression of the </SPAN><SPAN class="c1 c8">trp</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> promoter).</SPAN></P><P class="c14 c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Details</SPAN></P><P class="c4"><SPAN class="c1">Thirteen successive </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">amino terminal truncations of trpR </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">were l</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">ig</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">ated, in frame, downstream of the region coding for the Jα-helix in AsLOV2</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">.

Strickland et al. measured only a 5-fold change in DNA</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">-</SPAN><SPAN class="c0">binding affinity from dark state to light state in LovTAP. Though this change is </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">relatively small </SPAN><SPAN class="c0">(in biological scales), the EPF-Lausanne team found that there is a significant change in transcriptional output in response to 470nm light. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the EPF-Lausanne team found two mutations </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">that were predicted to </SPAN><SPAN class="c0">improve LovTAP’s function by increasing the stability of the light state and decreasing the time it takes to flip from dark state to light state.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c0 c8">UNAM</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c0">A new LovTAP part was synthesized by the UNAM 2010 team via the alteration of EPF-Lausanne’s LovTAP.

We hoped to study UNAM’s LovTAP and possibly introduce other mutations to improve LovTAP’s function. </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">For example, Strickland et al. identified mutations that increased LovTAP’s dynamic range (i.e. the difference in repression in the dark state vs. the light state) from 5 to 70.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        Another issue is that the conf</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">ormational change of </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">LovTAP</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> in the presence of</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> light is relatively unstable. Upon removal of the light source, LovTAP quickly returns to a con</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">formation in which the Jα-helix binds to the AsLOV2 domain, inactivating the trpR DNA-binding activity.  </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">Thus, long exposure times might be necessary for the circuit to react to the light, which would be undesirable for drawing with a laser pointer.</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> We may have to search for mutations that stabilize the light state, and thus allow </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">LovTAP to remain in the light state for a longer time after being activated</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c10 c3">Peking Bi-stable Switch </SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Overview</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        The Peking 2007 iGEM team designed a genet</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">ic</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> switch that can be flipped between two stable states (on and off), a so</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">-</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">called bi-stable switch. Such a switch would be desirable in the Etch-a-Sketch circuit because it would allow the bacteria to “remember” if it </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">had been</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> exposed to light, </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">so that</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> only a short exposure to light would be necessary to draw on our bacteria (rather than keeping the light on the bacteria until color appeared). However, </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">the switch </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">design was not ideal </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">because</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> one state was not completely stable; once the switch </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">wa</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">s flipped on, it slowly decayed back to the off state. We would like our drawings to be permanent (to some degree), so we would need the </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">activated</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> state to be stable. We therefore redesigned the Peking bi-stable switch for this purpose.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Original Design</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        The Peking 2007 switch uses the pR</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> and</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> pRM promoters</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> and the</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> cI and cI434 </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">transcriptional regulatory</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> proteins. </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">The</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> cI protein activates pRM and represses pR; cI434 represses pRM; pR has high basal transcription; and pRM has low basal transcription. </SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Deactivated State</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">In</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> the first state, cI434 levels are high and cI levels are low. This leads to high transcription from pR and low transcription from pRM, which, in this particular circuit, results in GFP production. The switch can be flipped by increasing cI </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">levels.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Activated State</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">In the second state, cI levels are high and cI434 levels are low.

Empirical evidence shows the switch will spontaneously decay back to </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">the deactivated state</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">. This is probably due to the high basal transcription levels of pR.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Our </SPAN><SPAN class="c1 c3">D</SPAN><SPAN class="c1 c3">esign: Locking Switch</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">For our switch, we desired a simple circuit with a stable on state. The parts we used are ptrp, cI434, pRM, trpR, and cI. As in the Peking switch, cI activates pRM and cI434 represses pRM. We cloned two additional parts for our switch: ptrp and trpR. ptrp is the well-known </SPAN><SPAN class="c1 c8">trp</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">promoter and operator</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> sequence. trpR is the corresponding</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">repressor which is induced by tryptophan. In our system, we will assume there are constantly high levels of tryptophan so that trpR will always act as a repressor. </SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Deactivated State</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">When deactivated</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">, cI434 levels are high, trpR levels are low, and cI levels are low. This results in high transcription from ptrp, low transcription from pRM, and thus low output signal. The switch can be flipped by reducing transcription from </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">ptrp.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Activated State</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">In the </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">active </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">state, cI434 levels are low, trpR levels are high, and cI levels are high. This results in low transcription from ptrp, high transcription from pRM, and thus high output signal. Since trpR is a strong repressor for ptrp, we expect state 2 to be stable.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c10 c3">mRFP1</SPAN></P><P class="c6 c5"><SPAN class="c1">For our output signal, we decided to use mRFP1. </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">mRFP1 is a red fluorescent protein based on DsRed. Natural DsRed requires tetramerization in order to fluoresce. mRFP1 contains 33 mutations that, one, allow it to function as a monomer and, two, allow it to fold more quickly. </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">It has many attractive qualities: the color is visible in normal lighting; no special supplements are necessary for the color to develop; the coding sequence for the protein is short (as compared to </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">other pigment generating proteins</SPAN><SPAN class="c1">); finally, the protein itself generates the color, which hopefully will result in faster image development than a protein which catalyzes a reaction that generates color.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c10 c3">Engineering Problems</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        We have identified five major engineering problems with Etch-a-Sketch that we have called: Light, Sensitivity, Selectivity, Speed, and Noise.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Light - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">In order to draw on bacteria with a laser pointer, we need the bacteria to respond to light. </SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Sensitivity - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">In order to draw naturally, we need the bacteria to respond to extremely quick pulses of light; otherwise, we would have to make very slow strokes.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Selectivity</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> - In order to use the bacteria in ambient lighting, we need to the bacteria to be able to selectively respond to just the laser pointer.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Speed</SPAN><SPAN class="c1"> - After we make our strokes with the laser pointer, we would like to see color quickly.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Noise - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">We do not want random spots to appear on our canvas.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        We have prioritized Light and Sensitivity. This hopefully would result in something that works like an old camera; instant image capture but overnight image development.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c10 c3">Circuit</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Overview</SPAN></P><P class="c5 c6"><SPAN class="c1">We have broken down the circuit into four states: Deactivated, Activation 1, Activation 2, and Activated. To recap the parts of our circuit: LovTAP represses ptrp in the light; trpR represses ptrp; cI434 repressed pRM; cI activates pRM; T7 polymerase (T7 P) transcribes at the T7 promoter; and mRFP1 generates a red color.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Deactivated</SPAN></P><P class="c6 c5"><SPAN class="c1">In the dark, LovTAP is inactive; transcription levels from ptrp should be high, creating a lot of cI434 which should shut down transcription from pRM.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Activation 1</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        After light is applied, LovTAP is activated, repressing transcription from ptrp. cI434 levels should begin to fall.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Activation 2</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        Once cI434 levels have dropped enough so that transcription from pRM can begin, the circuit enters an irreversible positive feedback loop. trpR levels will begin to increase, preventing the creation of cI434. cI levels will increase, further increasing transcription from pRM. Finally, T7 polymerase levels will increase, allowing the creation of mRFP1.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Activated</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1">        After entering the Activation 2 state, the light may be removed, and the cell will continue to produce mRFP1.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c3">Mapping the circuit back to the engineering problems</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Light - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">Our light response depends entirely on LovTAP. If it proves ineffectual, we will either need to introduce mutations that will help its function, or switch to a different system.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Sensitivity - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">The amount of time necessary to keep the laser pointer on the bacteria should be related to the time it takes for the locking switch to flip to the activated state and the length of time LovTAP remains in its activated state once illuminated. The former should be small by design of the switch. The latter may be improved by mutations or changing to a different light response system, if necessary.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Selectivity - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">The circuit should respond to only to wavelengths and intensities of light that can flip LovTAP from the dark state to the light state. Since LovTAP responds primarily to blue light, we may need to work in red ambient lighting.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Speed - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">The delay from the moment the locking switch is activated to the appearance of color will be related to the time it takes for the bacteria to synthesize mRFP1. This will hopefully be minimized as transcription from T7 promoters is very high when T7 polymerase is present.</SPAN></P><P class="c5"><SPAN class="c1 c8">Noise - </SPAN><SPAN class="c1">Unwanted splotches will be created if there is unwanted transcription from the T7 promoter or if the locking switch is accidentally turned on by unwanted transcription from the pRM promoter. The former should be minimal as the T7 promoter is very specific to T7 polymerase. The latter should be reduced by placing the locking switch on a low-copy plasmid.</SPAN></P><TABLE style="color:#1b2c8a;background-color:#0c6;" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="62%" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers" title="Team:Rutgers">Home</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Team" title="Team:Rutgers/Team">Team</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="https://igem.org/Team.cgi?year=2011&amp;team_name=Rutgers" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Official Team Profile</A></TH><TH align="center"><STRONG class="selflink">Etch-a-Sketch</STRONG></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Full_Adder" title="Team:Rutgers/Full Adder">Full Adder</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/MYSIS" title="Team:Rutgers/MYSIS">MYS!S</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Parts" title="Team:Rutgers/Parts">Parts Submitted to the Registry</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Modeling" title="Team:Rutgers/Modeling">Modeling</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Notebook" title="Team:Rutgers/Notebook">Notebook</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Safety" title="Team:Rutgers/Safety">Safety</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Rutgers/Acknowledgements" title="Team:Rutgers/Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</A></TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="printfooter">
