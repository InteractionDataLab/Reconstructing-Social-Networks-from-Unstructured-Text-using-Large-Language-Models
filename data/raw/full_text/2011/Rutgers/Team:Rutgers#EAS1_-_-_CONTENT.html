This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. In particular, the bacteria need to be sensitive enough to respond to a short light pulse from a laser, but still “selective” to not respond to ambient lighting. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification. For example, researchers creating biosensors may find our work very helpful.

Previous iGEM teams have worked on many different ways to do this each with different advantages and disadvantages. We were struck by the simplicity and beauty of LovTAP. In particular, it functions by itself as a single protein; it is a brilliant example of genetic engineering; and, finally, it does not require any exotic supplements or specific strains of bacteria to function.</P><H4 class="shadow"> LovTAP Parts</H4><P>As mentioned previously, LovTAP is a fusion protein. It consists of a light-response domain and a DNA binding domain, each of which are parts of other natural proteins.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" class="stuff"><H4 class="shadow">Light Response</H4><P class="stuff">	The light-response domain is LOV2, the photoactive domain (i.e. the light responsive part) of AsLOV2 (Avena sativa phototropin 1). AsLOV2 is a protein which allows Avena sativa to respond to 470 nm light. It does this by undergoing a major conformational change upon being struck by a photon with a wavelength near 470 nm. The absorption of the photon leads to the formation of a covalent bond between a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor and a conserved cysteine residue. </P><P class="stuff">This new bond distorts the conformation of the protein, causing the detachment and unfolding of the Ja-helix (see figure 1). In natural AsLOV2, the unfolding of the Ja-helix results in further downstream signalling. However, we will be most interested in the fact that the Ja-helix detaches when LOV2 is hit by blue light.</P><P class="stuff"> </P><P class="stuff">Figure 1.</P><H4 class="shadow"> </H4><H4 class="shadow">DNA Binding</H4><P class="stuff">The DNA binding domain of LovTAP is the well-known bacterial transcription factor trpR.

LOV2 binds and unbinds an alpha-helix in response to light, and one domain in the functional trpR structure is “bound” to an alpha-helix. Strickland et al.’s idea was to force them to “fight over” a single alpha helix. Thus, since LOV2 has a higher affinity for the helix in the dark than trpR, there is no trpR activity in the dark. However, when exposed to light, LOV2 releases the alpha helix, allowing trpR to bind it and, thus, result in trpR activity (which of course is repression of the trp promoter).</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top"> </TD><TD><P>Figure 3</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><H4 class="shadow">Details</H4><P class="stuff">Thirteen successive amino terminal truncations of trpR were ligated, in frame, downstream of the region coding for the Ja-helix in AsLOV2. One construct, referred to as LovTAP (the LOV- and tryptophan-activated protein), showed increased binding affinity to trp operator DNA when illuminated. Further tests showed that, upon light exposure, LovTAP binds DNA in a manner that is characteristic of the trpR domain. Additionally, mutation of the conserved cysteine of the LOV2 domain, which should prevent the conformational change that releases the Ja-helix, was shown to abolish binding to DNA in the presence of light. As this cysteine is crucial in the function of LOV2, this result suggests that the observed light sensitivity of the DNA-binding activity is due to LOV2.</P><P class="stuff"><STRONG>Taken from Strickland et al.</STRONG></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P class="stuff">A.

Whether this was due to the mutation that was introduced or some other factor is unclear. We hoped to study UNAM’s LovTAP and possibly introduce other mutations to improve LovTAP’s function. For example, Strickland et al. identified mutations that increased LovTAP’s dynamic range (i.e. the difference in repression in the dark state vs. the light state) from 5 to 70.</P><P class="stuff">	Another issue is that the conformational change of LovTAP in the presence of light is relatively unstable. Upon removal of the light source, LovTAP quickly returns to a conformation in which the Jα-helix binds to the AsLOV2 domain, inactivating the trpR DNA-binding activity.  Thus, long exposure times might be necessary for the circuit to react to the light, which would be undesirable for drawing with a laser pointer. We may have to search for mutations that stabilize the light state, and thus allow LovTAP to remain in the light state for a longer time after being activated.</P><P class="stuff">Figure 5.

Such a switch would be desirable in the Etch-a-Sketch circuit because it would allow the bacteria to “remember” if it had been exposed to light, so that only a short exposure to light would be necessary to draw on our bacteria (rather than keeping the light on the bacteria until color appeared). </P><P class="stuff">However, the switch design was not ideal because one state was not completely stable; once the switch was flipped on, it slowly decayed back to the off state. We would like our drawings to be permanent (to some degree), so we would need the activated state to be stable. We therefore redesigned the Peking bi-stable switch for this purpose.</P><H4 class="shadow">Original Design </H4><P class="stuff">	The Peking 2007 switch uses the pR and pRM promoters and the cI and cI434 transcriptional regulatory proteins. The cI protein activates pRM and represses pR; cI434 represses pRM; pR has high basal transcription; and pRM has low basal transcription. </P><H4 class="shadow">Deactivated State</H4><P>Figure 6.</P><P> </P><P class="stuff">In the first state, cI434 levels are high and cI levels are low.

We cloned two additional parts for our switch: ptrpL and trpR. ptrpL is the well-known trp promoter and operator sequence. trpR is the corresponding repressor which is induced by tryptophan.

The former should be small by design of the switch. The latter may be improved by mutations or changing to a different light response system, if necessary. </P><P class="stuff"><STRONG>Selectivity</STRONG> - The circuit should respond to only to wavelengths and intensities of light that can flip LovTAP from the dark state to the light state. Since LovTAP responds primarily to blue light, we may need to work in red ambient lighting. </P><P class="stuff"><STRONG>Speed</STRONG> - The delay from the moment the locking switch is activated to the appearance of color will be related to the time it takes for the bacteria to synthesize mRFP1. This will hopefully be minimized as transcription from T7 promoters is very high when T7 polymerase is present. </P><P class="stuff"><STRONG>Noise</STRONG> - Unwanted splotches will be created if there is unwanted transcription from the T7 promoter or if the locking switch is accidentally turned on by unwanted transcription from the pRM promoter. The former should be minimal as the T7 promoter is very specific to T7 polymerase. The latter should be reduced by placing the locking switch on a low-copy plasmid.</P><P class="stuff"> </P></TD><TD width="25%" align="center" valign="baseline" background="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2011/9/96/Stripe.png" td=""><P> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" background="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Transparent.png"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="7" td="" background="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2011/9/96/Stripe.png"><H1><SPAN class="shadow"> Results</SPAN></H1></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="6" class="stuff"><H4 class="shadow"> Overview</H4><P class="stuff">	Unfortunately, we were unable to finish constructing our circuit in time for the wiki freeze. </P>&lt;groupparts&gt;iGEM011 Rutgers&lt;/groupparts&gt;<P class="stuff"> </P></TD><TD width="25%" align="center" valign="baseline" background="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2011/9/96/Stripe.png" td=""><P> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><P> </P><DIV class="printfooter">
