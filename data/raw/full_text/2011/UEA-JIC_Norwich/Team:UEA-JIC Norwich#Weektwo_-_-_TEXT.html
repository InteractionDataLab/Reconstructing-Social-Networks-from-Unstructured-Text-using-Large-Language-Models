The team researched tiresomely throughout the day to ensure a foundation for the project and it’s experiments were set for the coming weeks.
Meetings started with various lecturers in order to start planning the first outreach event.
More research!
Told last night after going to see X-men that we need to have a poster completed and ready for use by Friday. Spent the day writing poster drafts and designing the layout, as well as attempting to copy the logo we designed onto the computer. We also updated the Wiki and gave it a new navigation bar, and looked into flight and hotel prices for Amsterdam!
Spent the day preparing for a brief presentation to the staff of the JIC so that we could prove we've actually done something! Researched more deeply into possible methods of ensuring light production only in the dark. We decided finally on three model organisms, Moss, Algae and E. coli, and divided the team into three sub-teams to work semi-independently on each project. Ben, Gurdeep and Mark are on team E.coli, Kimberley, Mario and Jazz are on team algae and finally Alistair, Ben Hardy and Abbie are on team moss.
