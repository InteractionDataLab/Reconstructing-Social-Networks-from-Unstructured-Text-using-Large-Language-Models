Project Overview
Our project title is; The evolution of Synthetic Biology; The introduction of new photosynthetic eukaryotes as model organisms. We chose Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as our experimental organisms. We aimed to test BioBricks in these species to see if they would be compatible in eukaryotes
Human Practices
For our Human Practices we wanted to find out whether Synthetic Biology was feared and the reasons behind whether it was feared or if people were welcoming of this new scientific discipline. Click on the link above to find out more..
UK Team Meet
This year the UEA/JIC iGEM team was proud to host the Annual iGEM UK conference. The meet up provided a great opportunity to find out how other teams were progressing and the kinds of directions their projects were taking. The meet up also provided an unmissable opportunity to socialise and to fully engage in the spirit of iGEM. Click on the link above to find out more.
The University of East Anglia,  working in collaboration with the John Innes Centre, would like to introduce our first team to enter the iGEM competition, UEA-JIC_Norwich. Our team includes nine students, eight of us are studying disciplines in Biology and we also have a lone chemist! We have been predominantly based at the John Innes Centre and at the School of Biological Sciences at UEA.
We are proud to present our project:
The evolution of Synthetic Biology; The introduction of new photosynthetic eukaryotes as model organisms.
The organisms we chose to introduce were Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Please feel free to browse our wiki pages to learn more about our project.
