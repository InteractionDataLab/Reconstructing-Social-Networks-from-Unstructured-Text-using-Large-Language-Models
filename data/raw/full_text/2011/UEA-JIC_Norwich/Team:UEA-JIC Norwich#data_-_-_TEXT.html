As shown in the figure below, the long term aim of our project was to test biobricks by growing them in E.coli and then transferring them into the photosynthetic eukaryotes to see whether they would also work in plants. For our project we therefore aimed to make promoters and terminators which could be used in both bacteria and plants, so that future researchers in Synthetic Biology could use these parts with a biobrick of their choice inserted in between them.
BioBrick Design
Due to the fact plants such as Physcomitrella patens have quite extensive generation periods it was difficult to do elaborate testing. It may be suggested in future to do meta-transformations in a day if you have the work force to do so. The Algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also proved to be quite challenging to transform compared to your standard E.coli; in future it may be good to try all techniques to get a higher probability of successful transformations. This could also be elaborated via transforming the nuclear and chloroplast genomes which could give a higher probability of success as well as working in tempo with the circadian rhythm of the species giving better results.  If we had more time further testing of our biobricks in their complete stages would have also been ideal to allow reassurance of our chosen plant species to be used by future iGEM teams and allow the concept of Synthetic Biology to evolve in eukaryotic organisms.
