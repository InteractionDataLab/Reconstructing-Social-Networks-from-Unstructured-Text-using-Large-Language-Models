The UK iGEM meet up
This year Norwich is proud to host the annual meet up of all the iGEM teams. Our team is based at the John Innes Centre, located in the Norwich Research Park. The John Innes Centre is a world leader in plant and molecular biology, and we believed that this would provide us with ample resources to inspire and innovate other teams. We have several speakers coming to the conference to talk about a range of subjects, from synthetic biology to iGEM competition tips to plant biology, the latter given by Dr Paul O' Maille, our lab manager. Now that all components of the two days are in place we look forward to having teams from all over the United Kingdom here in one of the top centres for research in the world. See you all soon!
