UK Team Meet
This year the UEA/JIC iGEM team was proud to host the Annual iGEM UK conference. The meet up provided a great opportunity to socialise with members from other teams, as well as find out how other teams were progressing and the kinds of directions their projects were taking. Click on the link above to find out more.
Human Practices
For our Human Practices we wanted to find out whether Synthetic Biology was feared, and the reasons behind whether it was or not. Click on the link above to find out more..
Our Sponsors
We wanted to dedicate a page to all of the sponsors who made what we've achieved possible. Without their help we wouldn't have been able to achieve half of what we have. Thank you! Click on the link above to see who lent a hand.
The University of East Anglia and the John Innes Centre are entering the iGEM competition for the first time! We  are a team of nine students from a range of disciplines within Biology (as well as one chemist) supported by a long-suffering collaboration of advisors. We're based in  the Norwich Research Park, and are using the facilities there to introduce a species of algae and a species of moss to iGEM for use as two new model organisms in the competition. For a full outline of our project and the reasons behind it, visit our "Aims" section. Follow us on Twitter and facebook too!
