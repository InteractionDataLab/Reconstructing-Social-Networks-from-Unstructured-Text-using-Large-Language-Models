Problem with repressilator: signal loses clarity after subsequent rounds. Two approaches to solve this: 1. Use three-gene repressilator together with protease which degrades transcription factors which prevent steady state.  2. Use five-step repressilator to give transcription factors more time to degrade to keep the non- steady state active.

A list has to be made of all BioBrick parts that are possibly useful for this project.
February 22
The BioBrick parts table has to be updated. The table should contain the sequences and functions of the parts, and information on whether the parts are tested or not and whether they work or not.
