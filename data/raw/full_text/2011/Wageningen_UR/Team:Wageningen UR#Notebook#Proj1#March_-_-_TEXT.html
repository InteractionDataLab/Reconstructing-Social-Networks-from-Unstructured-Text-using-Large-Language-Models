The pathways have been modelled in Tinkercell. The model is divided into three modules: the quorum sensing/synchronising module, the luciferase regenerating module and the dual quorum sensing/synchronising module. We need to make a gene list for each module, preferably completely biobricked. The design has to be evaluated and modeled. Therefore, more information is needed on the transcription, translation, diffusion and degradation rates.

We have to make a list of which BioBrick parts we exactly need for the overall design.

Modeling turns out to be difficult. We decide we need a few tutorials on how to model things in MATLAB.
