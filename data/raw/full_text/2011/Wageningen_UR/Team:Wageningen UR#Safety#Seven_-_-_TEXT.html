Biosafety regulation
The Netherlands provides a set of regulations for the genetic modification of organisms. Specifically, Synthetic Biology is under the attention of the Commission of Genetically Modified Organisms. In the future, laws specifically applicable to Synthetic Biology might be put forward.
Our university provides practical rules to maintain biological safety.
These regulations will be discussed in detail in the sub pages.
