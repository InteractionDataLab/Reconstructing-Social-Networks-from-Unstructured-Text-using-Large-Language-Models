The highschool presentation about synthetic biology was initially made for vwo 5 and vwo 6. Vwo is the highest level of education in the Dutch high school system and the students in vwo 5 and  vwo 6 are in the age of sixteen to eighteen. The duration of the presentation was about 50 minutes, see Presentation SynBio for the contents (in Dutch).
With the presentation we tried to explain the basic concepts of synthetic biology and we showed some results of previous iGEM competitions. The goal of the presentation was to raise knowledge about the subject and make the students enthusiastic.
On the picture below you see one of our teammembers giving the presentation to the Dutch finalists of the International Biology Olympiad. The students came to Wageningen to perform several experiments and to prepare themselves for the International finals.
