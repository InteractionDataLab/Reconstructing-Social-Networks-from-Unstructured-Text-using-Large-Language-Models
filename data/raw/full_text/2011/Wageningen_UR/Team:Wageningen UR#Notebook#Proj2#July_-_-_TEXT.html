July 4
4 Erlenmeyers containing transformation medium were inoculated with either 0.5*106, 1*106, 5*106 or 107 spores/mL and were grown overnight at 30˚C. This time fresh spores were used which were derived from a spore plate that had grown for 4 days.
July 5
Dr. LdG showed us how to recover protoplasts from mycelium. He used the mycelium derived from the 1*106 spores/mL medium, as this one showed the least amount of pellets and decent growth. Buffers with ranging osmotic values were prepared to see whether this had any effect on protoplast formation. This time the protoplast recovery resulted in approximately 80 aliquots.
July 6
Again, a test was carried out to check the amount of viable protoplasts in the protoplast solutions and to check for mycelia contamination. Results will be visible on Friday, July 8.
