Abstract
Fungi have versatile metabolic capabilities that allow them to consume, transform, and produce a great variety of biomolecules. In the course of this iGEM project, we aim to explore the possibilities of cell-to-cell communication in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Engineered cell-to-cell communication in fungi is a relatively unexplored aspect of synthetic biology.
Our goal is to activate a synthetic genetic circuit at one end of a fungal hypha, and allow our signal to propagate to neighboring cells via diffusion and subsequent activation of a positive (genetic) feedback loop. Read more
