The international Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is a major competition in Synthetic Biology for undergraduate students. This year will be the eighth time this competition is held and the first time that a team from Wageningen University will participate. Our team aims to use a synthetic biology approach to engineer artificial cell-to-cell communication systems. Our main project is to create a "Synchronized Oscillatory System" hereafter named "Synchroscillator" and we also have a side project which we call: "Fungal Track 'n Trace" . The aim of the Synchroscillator project is to produce periodic oscillatory protein expression in E. coli, synchronized across a population, using the quorum sensing machinery from Vibrio fischerii. The Fungal Track 'n Trace project aims to implement an artificial intercellular communication system in the hyphal fungus Aspergillus nidulans.
