Research has to be done to find orthologs in Aspergillus and to make sure the genes we want to use are really present in Aspergillus. A decision has to be made about what kind of selection markers we are going to use. We are looking for an RFP variant which can be functionally expressed in Aspergillus.

We might have a problem: the mechanism might not work, because there is small leakage from the leu3p repressing system which isn’t wanted because we have an autoinducing system. We have to contact our supervisors about it and talk about it how big the problem is.
March 22
The list of the genes is almost finished! Next step: making a BioBrick Design.
March 29
There was some debate about whether we should work with Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus niger. Aspergillus nidulans is decided to be the best choice.
