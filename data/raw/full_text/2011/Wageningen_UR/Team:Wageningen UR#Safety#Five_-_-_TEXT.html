Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?
In itself, the cell chassis that is used is not considered to be dangerous to human beings. Despite the involved BioBrick system of our project, the chassis that we use is not pathogenic or harmful. If a person or organization with malicious intent was in need of a living toxin producing system, our BioBrick system would be very inefficient. That is, the toxin gene would be expressed with fluctuations. It seems highly unlikely that the system or any of its components could be weaponized. Because of these reasons we think our BioBrick system is reasonably secure.
