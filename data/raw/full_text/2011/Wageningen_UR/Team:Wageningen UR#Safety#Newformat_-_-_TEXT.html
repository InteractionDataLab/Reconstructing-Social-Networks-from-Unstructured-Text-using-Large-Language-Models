Introduction
Building living machines is fun. However, biological research in general, and synthetic biology in particular, are subject to inherent hazards which can affect researchers, the public and the environment. Therefore, it is crucial that we gain a thorough understanding of the possible dangers emerging from our work and take the necessary precautions to minimize the risk of hazards occurring. This page will provide an overview of the issues related to biological safety and security during our team’s participation in iGEM 2011 by providing answers to several biosafety and –security questions.
