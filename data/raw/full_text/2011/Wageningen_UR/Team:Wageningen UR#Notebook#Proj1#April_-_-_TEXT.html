This week a work plan will be constructed for the oscillation project.
April 12
The work plan for the oscillation project is still in progress. Rob suggested to work with luciferase instead of GFP for the oscillation project because he already has experience with luciferase. He will check the technical details for this. It is not possible to get a microfluidics devices such as the one used in Danino et al. 2010. But it might be possible to get a different device which could work.
