February 2
We have to decide which of the four (!) projects we really want to work on. Our four ideas are: a bacterial random generator, a bacterial synchronized oscillatory system, a plant with leaves that produce light if you touch them and a fungus with visible signal propagation through the hyphae.
February 8
After a lot of discussions we decide to vote. The fungus project is one of the two projects we will continue to work on! Some team members are very sad the DiscoDopsis (plant project) didn't make it.
February 22
We are searching for information about fungi in general. How fast do molecules diffuse through fungal septa? We are also working on a list of all BioBrick Parts we can possibly use for this project.
