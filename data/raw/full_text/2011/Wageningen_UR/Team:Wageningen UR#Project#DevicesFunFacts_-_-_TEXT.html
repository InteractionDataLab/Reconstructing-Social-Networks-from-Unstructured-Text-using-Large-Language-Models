Some fun facts about the device
Some fun facts about the device
Getting the chambre watertight was a lot trickier than expected and many creative ideas came up:
In the end silicone glue used for sealing aquariums solved the problem.
The tubing and valves used for the final setup of the device were bought at a local pet store.
During the first measurements, someone had to run to the microscopy room every ten minutes to take a picture. However, we built a LEGO robot controlling the microscope which could take the measurements and give our team lots of time to work on other interesting things. BioBricks combined with LEGO bricks turned out to be the ultimate solution for our problem.
