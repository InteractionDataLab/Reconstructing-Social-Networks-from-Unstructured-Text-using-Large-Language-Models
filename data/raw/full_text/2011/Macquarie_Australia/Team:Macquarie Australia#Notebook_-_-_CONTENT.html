</P><UL><LI> Step 1) We diluted the primer stock down to a concentration of 100uM. We did this by taking the weight of the primers and multiplying them by 100 and then adding this amount of water to the stock.  
</LI></UL><DL><DD> So, for example, if our amount of Oligo = 38.3nmol, we add 383ul of water (which gives us a concentration of 100uM)

</P><P><B>TEAM COMPETENT CELLS</B></P><P>-Competent Cell Method Modified from Inoue et al. 1992- Colonies isolated and inoculated to 150ml of SOB medium and grown to an A600 of between 0.2-0.8 at room temperature overnight (18-22 C) with vigorous shaking (200-250 rpm), then place on ice for 10min. The culture was transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and spun at 2500 x g for 10 min at 4 C. Cells pelleted by spinning the tubes at ~2,500 g for ~7 min at 4°C in the Sigma centrifuge. Supernatant removed, and immediately the tube was placed on ice. Cells were resuspended in 1-5 ml of ice-cold TB buffer by gently pipetting up and down with a 1 ml pipette. Ice-cold TB buffer was added to bring the volume up to ~1/5th of the original culture volume, and mixed by gently inverting. Tube was incubated on ice for 10 min. Centrifugation step repeated, supernatant poured off and cells gently resuspend in ~1/20th of the original culture volume of ice-cold TB buffer. 930 l of your cell suspension added to 1.5 microcentrifuges. 70 l of DMSO  added to each. Aliquots of 100 *l of the competent cell suspension were combined with DMSO into microcentrifuge tubes. Competent cell aliquots where then frozen in liquid nitrogen.
In order to prepare and transform competent E.coli cells various nutrient broths, such as LB, LB agar, SOC and SOB medium, were prepared.
</P><P><B>MEDIA PREP</B></P><P>-LB media Method-
Dissolve 10g tryptone, 5g yeast extract and 10g NaCl in 800 mL MilliQ water, making use of a magnetic stirrer. Once dissolved, bring volume up to 1 liter using the MilliQ water. Autoclave 500 mL of the solution (121°C, 15 min, standard liquid cycle).
</P><P>-LB agar Method-
Add 7.5 g Bacto agar to the remaining 500 mL of LB media and autoclave [121°C, 15 min, standard liquid cycle]. Add 250 µL of Chloroamphenicol and mix well before plating out and setting agar. 
</P><P>After cooling and antibiotic addition, the LB agar was plated out using aseptic technique. 14 LB agar plates were prepared and allowed to cool next to the Bunsen. After this all plates were aseptically sealed using parafilm and stored in the refrigerator. 
</P><P>SOC and SOB medium are known to result in higher transformation efficiencies of plasmids (1).
</P><P>-SOC media (for competent cells)- 
A mixture of 4g 2% w/v bacto-tryptone (20 g), 1g 0.5% w/v bacto-yeast extract, 400µl 5M NaCl, 250 µl 2M KCl, 20mM MgSO4 (0.4821 g), 0.7222g 20mM glucose and MilliQ H2O to 200 mL. The adjusted quantities were combined in 1l measuring column with constant stirring and then placed in the autoclave for sterilization.
</P><P>
-SOB Media (for competent cells)-
Distilled H2O of volume 900ml was added with 5g Bacto Tryptone, 1.25g Bacto Yeast Extract, 0.124 grams NaCl and 0.0475 grams KCl. This was then adjust to pH 7.0 with NaOH or HCl and then to 250mL with distilled H2O. The system was then sterilized by autoclaving.
</P><P><B>BUFFER PREP</B></P><P>TB buffer (for competent cells)- 2 grams of CaCl2-2H2O, 18.6 grams of KCl and 3 grams of PIPES where mixed and dissolved in ca 500ml of water with the pH adjusted to 6.7 with KOH. Then, 10.9 grams of MnCl2-4H2O, isdissolved in 300 ml of water, mixed and the solution adjusted to 1L. This is then sterilized by filtration through a pre-rinsed 0.45 µm filter unit and stored at 4 C. The solution is stable at 4 C indefinitely. All salts are added as solids. Resulting solution was colourless and unautoclaved.
</P><P>TAE buffer - A total volume of 500 mL was made up as a 50x stock solution from 121 g of Tris base dissolved in water with 28.55 mL of glacial acetic acid and 50 mL 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0).
</P><P>EDTA buffer - 18.61 g of EDTA solid, 90 mL of water, and was adjusted to pH 8.0 using 10 M NaOH.
</P><P><B>Preparation of gel electrophoresis system</B></P><P>A Sub-Cell GT Agarose Gel Electrophoresis system was set up according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The tray used was 15 x 10 cm and required 120ml gel volume to achieve a 1cm thick gel size.
</P><P>The 1.2% agarose gel was made up to 200ml by combining 2.4g of agarose gel powder with 200ml of previously prepared TAE buffer. This was placed in the microwave to fully dissolve the agar powder. After the gel liquid cooled to around 60°C it was poured into the UV Transparent Plastic (UVTP) tray.
</P><P>During this time a GelGreen Nucleic Acid Gel Stain was prepared for post gel staining. A 0.1M NaCl solution was made up to 500ml and 150μl of 10000X GelGreen stock was added.
</P><P>After the gel solidified the system was submerged in TAE buffer. The samples were loaded in appropriate wells and the system was allowed to run for 1 hour.
</P><P>Following this the gel was removed and submerged in the previously prepared GelGreen stain. The gel remained submerged in the staining solution for 30min with constant agiatation.
</P><P>The stained gel was finally analysed using a Gel-Doc EZ Imager for visualisation of PCR products.

Restriction enzyme or plasmid problem. Competent cells not competent or low efficiency.
However, we've realised that the sequences of the linearised vectors don’t have the <I>Spe</I>I or <I>Xba</I>I sites. These supplied linearised vectors can only be used in subsequent biobrick construction when they are cut with <I>Eco</I>RI and <I>Pst</I>RI.
</P><P>Checked competent cells with some pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 clones from the iGEM distribution kit (Plate 1, position 3A and 5A) that we can use instead. See the photos: This means that our competent cells are good!!! Yay. These plasmids can be used for digestion with <I>Spe</I>I and <I>Xba</I>I for your initial cloning.
</P><P>The cool thing is that they express red fluorescent protein (RFP) and are red in colour when IPTG is added. When digested with <I>Spe</I>I and <I>Xba</I>I and ligated with the genes they will be white.

</P><P>Agarose gel of <I>Eco</I>RI digestion of 2010 agro-BP plasmids to check plasmids are ok. Agarose gel of samples from opt PCR reaction for amplifying agro-BP (i.e. more <I>Eco</I>RI added). Digested plasmids will then be run on gel.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="2.2F9.2F2011">2/9/2011</SPAN></H3><P>•	Running of the PCR gel, containing the DR and AT PCR products from last week, along with the <I>Eco</I>RI digest of the AT template. See gel photo, but basically, conclusion was nothing worked. AT product sizes are either too big or too small, <I>Eco</I>RI digest did nothing, DR has no products.
So, 
•	Set-up re-PCR of AT and DR. For AT, the PCR was done with the 5 templates, along with 2 previously amplified PCR products of the region we want, and a set of replicates using Rob’s taq and PCR solutions (see gel photo on PCR optimization, only Rob’s samples were ran cause his thermocycler is faster). Recipe for PCR is the same, I’ve put up so many sets of them, just take a look at the others if you want to see the concentrations.
</P><P>•	Re-digest of the AT templates using a different <I>Eco</I>RI from Rob, theory was that the digest didn’t work because the <I>Eco</I>RI that we were using was spoiled, from all the taking in and out of the freezer, not keeping on ice etc. So, take a note.
</P><P>Re-PCR and the re-digest have yet to be ran, so those need to be done during next week.
Next, 
•	Ligation of the previously cleaned pooled DR PCR product to pSB1K3 and pSB1C3 plasmid backbone, along with the transformation. See previous protocol for recipe.
</P><P>•	Plasmid prep from the selected colonies, following the Qiagen Miniprep kit. For the colonies that we used, as corresponding to the colony PCR gel, see Nina’s results on the nanodrop.
</P><P>•	Setting up prep for sequencing facility, a reaction volume of 12ul, containing 200-500ng of DNA and 3.2pmol of primers were required. Primer used for this sequencing is the BB-Fwd primer.
Using the plasmids purified, 8.2ul of template was added to 3.8ul of 10pmol concentration of primers. 
Fingers crossed that we get a good sequence by next Friday.
</P><UL><LI><B>However, from the sequencing (results not shown), the inserts were either the original red fluorescent protein, or were in the wrong orientation, as the primers were not specific enough (only 1 base pair difference if  orientation was wrong).</B></LI></UL><P>

The only difference of this protocol to the previous colony PCR is that the primer volumes were halved, since we have been getting a lot of primer dimmers from the previous colony PCR.

</P><P>Note that the PCR cycle conditions are the same, which is NOT supposed to be correct for this reaction. The elongation time should have been 2.5 mins and not 1 min, which can be seen from the gel (not shown), that most of the lanes had nothing but dimerized primers. Only good thing we can get out of that is, if a band is present, it probably would not contain the things that we want.

We also spread these onto agar plates so that growth can be checked tomorrow.
</P><P>A PCR of the templates was run, using two different primer combinations for AT (Gel result attached).
</P><P>Further stock agar plates made up for use at a later time. (Both Kana and Cam)
</P><P>Somehow the HO did not work, the DR band was deemed to be the original template due to the excessive primer dimer bands, and the AT did not work.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="20.2F9.2F11">20/9/11</SPAN></H3><P>So today we had a look at the plates from yesterday of the T7, HO, DR, 6N and 15N (the last two were extracted from the Bio-Brick kit on Monday and grown on plates like our own T7, HO and DR). The HO and DR plates had lots of white colonies for both Kan and Cam vectors….indicating that some of these may have our insert in the vector in the correct orientation. However, the T7 was filled only with 5% white colonies and this most likely represents re-ligated plasmids. Also, the proportion of white colonies to red ones on the plate was very similar to the control (the water). Therefore, it was decided that the T7 didn’t work so only the HO and DR colonies were inoculated.
Also, as a sidenote, since we didn’t know which antibiotic the blue and red plates represented, the group yesterday spread each of our inserts onto both. Today, from the growth/lack there of, we now know that ‘red’ denotes Kan and ‘blue’ is Cam.
</P><P>As the restriction digest of the insert was done with <I>Xba</I>I and <I>Spe</I>I (due to our primer design), orientation of the insert becomes an issue. To screen for this, we’ve decided to screen the colonies using an <I>Xba</I>I restriction digest, instead of a colony PCR; inserts that are in the wrong orientation would have a scar tissue instead of an <I>Xba</I>I or <I>Spe</I>I cut site. 
</P><P>So, we inoculated 44 tubes. From each of the Kan-DR, Cam-DR, Kan-HO, Cam-HO plates, 10 individual white colonies were selected and each colony was put into a separate flacon tube containing 2mL liquid medium+ 2μl of the correct antibiotic. For example, for the Kan-DR, a white colony from the ‘Red-DR’ plate was chosen and put into a liquid medium containing 2μl kanamycin. For the 4 remaining tubes, the same process was repeated but this time with 6N and 15N and using Ampicillin. Only 2 colonies were selected for each because 6N and 15N are BioBricks, therefore, all the colonies should have the T7 insert in the vector. The 44 plates were then put on a shaker overnight at 37˚C and 120rpm.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="21.2F9.2F11">21/9/11</SPAN></H3><P>Colonies were mini-prep-ed using a Qiagen Spin Miniprep Kit. The extracted plasmids were then nano-dropped and have an average of about 10ng/ul of DNA. A 25ul restriction digest using <I>Xba</I>I and <I>Spe</I>I was set up as follows:

</P><P>Cut and uncut plasmids are all of the same size, showing that the <I>Xba</I>I digestion did not occur; re-ligation of plasmid would result in a scar tissue that <I>Xba</I>I could not cleave.

Along with that, another PCR optimization for the 2 phytochromes was set-up, using different buffers and different annealing temperature ranges.
