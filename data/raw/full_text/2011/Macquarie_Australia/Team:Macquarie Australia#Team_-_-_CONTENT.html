Get out of the labs&quot;  Lousie Brown, a perennial fixture in the laboratory, oversaw all groundwork. Her role as instructor and communicator ensured the smooth progress of the project. Her other role was to keep us all motivated and she was vital to the success of the team.</P><P><B>Robert &quot;Boss&quot; Willows</B> Rob Willows can be thought of as the overmind to this project - his insight into the biology, his experience in the labs and general brilliance allowed the team to negotiate all the twists and turns of the labwork. We would turn to Rob whenever the project threw a 'what's next' at the team. Rob would help out with PCR, suggest plates to use, what digest should be performed, troubleshooted our PCR programs, helped with colony screenings, interpretation of gels and solving problems alongside Louise Brown. He kept the project on track. </P><P><B>Joanna &quot;Jo it all&quot; Hare</B> Jo, now an Honours student at MQ, brought last year's experience with her and provided help with what a wiki should look like, how a lab should function, and other keys to success.</P><P><B>Nicki Packer</B>: &quot;Money&quot;  Nicki Packer worked on the team's finances, ensuring we were supplied with enough filter pipette tips, PCR cleanup kits, gel prep materials and allowing this unit to exist in the first place!</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Students">Students</SPAN></H2><P><B>Alxcia Sinclair</B> - &quot;Legs&quot; Alxcia Sinclair is in her final year of BBiotech and loving every second of it. She enjoys a good dance with her friends on the weekend, a beefy game of basketball and an epic bowl of nachos when she thinks she deserves it. She has become a bit more of a tech head working on the wiki and has contributed lab time to PCR preparations, gel organization and plate developments. Her obsessions are currently fixed towards protein analysis with posttranslational modifications being the main focus.</P><P><B>David Dubow</B> - &quot;Blue Dave&quot;  David Dubow is a 3rd year Bachelour of science student double majoring in chemistry and biomolecular sciences. He helped out with the technical work in the lab, such as operating the gel visualiser, nano-drop, creating inital concentrates for dilution, and working alongside Edward during the last two hectic weeks of prac work. He is looking forward to venturing into the field of astrobiology and discovering new and odd forms of life.&quot;I'm not good with living things!&quot;</P><P><B>Tania Tan.</B> - &quot;Stripes&quot;  Tania Tan is a 3rd year Bachelor of Science student majoring in Biomolecular Sciences and Chemistry. Involved in lab work with media prep, gel prep and 4 hours straight of plasmid purifications...! Apart from the realm of chemistry, she has turned into a work-a-holic lab tech, a gym-a-holic and studies music DJ-ing!!!</P><P><B>Peter Young</B> - &quot;Chris&quot;  Peter Young is a 4th year bachelor of science student, majoring biomolecular science and commencing a masters in policing and counter-terrorism. He enjoys spear fishing, rock climbing, mixed martial arts and hopefully soon gene doping (lol!) </P><P><B>Arjun Bhat</B> - &quot;AJ&quot;  Aj's is the team's wiki guru - working alongside Alxcia they created the backbone of the wiki theme. Aj's work also extended into general lab duty.
</P><P><B>David Handler</B> - &quot;Red Dave&quot;  David is in his third year of a Bachelor of Advanced Science with majors in Biology, Biomolecular sciences and English. His jobs for the team involve catch-all general lab work (nanodrop, gel work, PCR, plates) and help with wiki upkeep, design and photography. His future aspirations involve work with prions and science communication. David loves writing, making music and taking photographs in his spare time.  </P><P><B>Mihei  Hwang.</B> - &quot;Meticulous Mihei&quot; Mi Hei Hwang is a 3rd year Bachelor of Science student majoring in Biomolecular Sciences and Chemistry.
