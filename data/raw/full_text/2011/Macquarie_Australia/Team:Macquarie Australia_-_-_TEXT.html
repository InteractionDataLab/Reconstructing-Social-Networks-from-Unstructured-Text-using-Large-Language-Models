Welcome
Hello from the 2011 Macquarie University iGEM group!
This year's research team will be expanding upon the research conducted by last year's iGEM team. This project involves the production of a phytochrome light switch that jumps between two different light states, acting as a reporter for ambient light conditions. We've nicknamed our work 'the switch-a-roo' as our phytochromes hop back and forth between green and blue states.
Here are some quick links to help you get started:

Abstract
Phytochromes are ubiquitous proteins that allow an organism to sense light. These proteins have evolved in unique environments to sense light intensity in different colour ranges. This experiment focuses on constructing a biological switch that uses phytochromes from Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The coupling of heme oxygenase supplies our phytochrome proteins with biliverdin, allowing for the self-assembly of the switch within host systems. The switch is the first stage of a two component light sensor and when expressed at high level, there is a noticeable colour change of the cell when it is activated by light.
