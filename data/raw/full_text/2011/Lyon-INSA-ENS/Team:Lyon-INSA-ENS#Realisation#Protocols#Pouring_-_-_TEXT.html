Pouring of plates
This protocol aims at creating your own plates with desired antibiotics. It is more efficient than plating an antibiotic on an already-made plate. With 125mL of LB 2X and agar, this should allow to create about 8-10 plates. All must be sterile.
Procedure
1. Melt the agar completely in a water bath.
2. Allow it to cool down until you can hold it easily in bare hands. If too hot, the antibiotics would be damaged.
3. Meanwhile, add 2.5mL of each desired antibiotic (100X) into the LB 2X bottle
4. Mix the bottles in a sterile Erlen and pour immediately into sterile Petri dishes. All the surface should be covered but it doesn't need to be very thick.
5. Allow them to cool down and solidify and store them at 4°C.
