Third year student in Biology at the ENS Lyon, it is my first participation to iGEM and it is well worth it. The engeneering approch of this project is very interesting, opposed to the approach we can see in the fondamental research we are taught. iGem is also a great way to meet people, share idea, and have fun !
I hope to meet more people at the European Jamboree, then in the final round.
By the way, I am also a ninja.
