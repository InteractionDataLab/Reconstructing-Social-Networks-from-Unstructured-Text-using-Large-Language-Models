Philippe Thomas
Hello everyone! I'm Philippe... After a first participation in iGEM in 2010, my only wish was to be a part (...) of the new "lyonnaise" team! That's why I'm here, helping my friend while doing my intership. I want to enjoy even more than last year, because iGEM is so cooool! After droppy coli and the "chef", here comes Cobalto! see you soon ;)
