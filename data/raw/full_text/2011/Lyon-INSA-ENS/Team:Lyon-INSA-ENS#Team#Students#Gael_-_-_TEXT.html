Gael Chambonnier
Hi dudes,
I’m Gaël and I’m still a student at the INSA of Lyon while all my mates are going to be graduated in the last few month but without me because I had decided to take a gap year before my last year of studies, which allowed me to take fully part at the iGEM championship in 2010.
Then after 6 months in Australia and 3 in Spain, I’m back to the lab (again yo!!), giving my best to allow the team to go confident in Amsterdam where I hope I will meet again people I met last year. See yaaaaaaaaaaa!!
