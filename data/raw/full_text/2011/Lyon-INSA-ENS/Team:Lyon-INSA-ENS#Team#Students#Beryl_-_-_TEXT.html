Discover Lyon
Béryl Royer-Bertrand
My name is Béryl and I am a student in Bioinformatics and Modeling at INSA Lyon. If I am in the iGEM team, it is to discover in a funny way the world of Microbiology, synthetic biology and to improve my communication. I'm sure that these months will be great and useful for my future.
