Arnaud Rondelet
Graduated from INSA de Lyon in 2009, I decided to carry on with a PhD in Molecular Microbiology in the same school.
In 2010 I came down with a synthetic virus called iGEM and to recover from it Dr P.Lejeune told me to become the instructor of the 2010 INSA Lyon iGEM team. Since this time I struggle with this virus and being an advisors of INSA ENS team this year is my new treatment (Thanks Dr. C. Dorel).
More seriously and accurately being an instructor of last year team allowed me to learn a lot from students and as I wanted to learn again this year I am really glad I can be an advisor of this INSA ENS Team.
