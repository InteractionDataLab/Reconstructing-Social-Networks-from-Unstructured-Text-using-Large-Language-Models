Visits
Visit of a Nuclear Power Plant
On the 25th of May, the team went to the French Nuclear Power Plant Tricastin. Since we could ask questions and visited the installations of the site, it was for us a great opportunity to understand the context in which our project is inscribed.

iGEM Team is in the race
The "CROSS de l'INSA de LYON" gathers more than 600 runners in two races (4 and 6 km).
What makes this event so original is that most people, registered in teams of 4, run in fancy dress. The craziest costumes are even rewarded.
This year, around ten participants have represented the iGEM project among which were the remarkable "CobaltBuster" and "Pili-Pili" teams.
