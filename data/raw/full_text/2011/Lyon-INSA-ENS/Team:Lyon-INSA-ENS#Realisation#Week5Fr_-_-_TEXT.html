Semaine 5
From Monday the 11th of July to Friday the 15th of July 2011
Monday
Start of 5mL cultures of 18A (Amp), 24E (Amp) and Curli(Cn). Incubation at 37°C
Visit of Centraco.
Start of 50 mL cultures ( 50mL sterile LB, 500µL antibiotic, 100µL from the 5mL cultures ). Incubation at 37°C overnight.
Tuesday
Miniprep of the ligations from the previous week to check the insert : 5L+2L, 5L+24E, 2M+2L, 2M+24E, 2L-Tet, 24E-Tet
4 clones are chosen for each ligation.
Digestion and electrophoresis : no clone seemed to contain the insert. Decision to change the digestion, ligation and transformation protocol.
The sequencing results were not enough good due to too high concentration of mutated plasmid. Resent of dillute sample.
Another french newspaper "Le progrès" interviewed us.
Wednesday
Start of 5mL cultures of 22M, 2M, 2L, 5L, OmpR234 and RBS-GFP-LVA ( synthesized part with an unstable GFP )
Start of 50mL cultures for the same parts.
Miniprep of the clones with the mutated plasmid to get more plasmid for the next step.
Thursday
French national day but... we worked.
Midiprep of 22M, 2M, 2L, 5L, OmpR234, RBS-GFP-LVA.
Friday
