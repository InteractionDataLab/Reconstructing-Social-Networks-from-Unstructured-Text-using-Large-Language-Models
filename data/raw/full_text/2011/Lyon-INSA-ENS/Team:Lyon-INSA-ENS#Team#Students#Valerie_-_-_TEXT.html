Valérie Desjardin
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
After a Master of Advanced Studies in Biochemistry and a PhD in Chemistry and Science and Techniques of waste, now I teach Chemistry classes and also  a class dealing with radioactive waste management in the Energy Engineering and Environment department. My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM 2011 project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
