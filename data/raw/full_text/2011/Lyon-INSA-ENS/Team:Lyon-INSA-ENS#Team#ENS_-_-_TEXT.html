ENS : Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon
The Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon (see the website) is a high education institution whose statutes are those of a university with a few special features, in particular regarding the recruitment of students on a national competitive entrance examination and the admission with an auditeur status.
In its current form, this institution is considered as recent, resulting from the merge, on January 1st 2010, of the scientific branch and the arts, humanities and social sciences branch. In fact, it inherits from the Saint-Cloud and the Fontenay-aux-Roses schools founded by Jules Ferry in 1880 and 1882. It is dedicated to teaching, research and the dissemination of knowledge. It is both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, from accurate and experimental sciences, to human and social sciences. It gathers 2150 students including 400 PhD students.
The quality of research within the institution puts it on the 100th rank in 2010 among the 604 best universities in the world (among the 9000 identified by the Unesco) and on the 3rd rank in France according to the international ranking published by the Times Higher Education Supplement. The department of biology offers a general training of high level through a Bachelor’s degree in Sciences and technologies (BSc) and a “Biosciences” Master’s degree in partnership with renowned laboratories enabling a close bound between the education and the fundamental research activities. It also prepares students for careers in teaching with a preparation for aggregation of Life Sciences and Sciences of the Earth and the Universe. At the end of their education, around 80% of our students follow a thesis in various fields of Biology.
