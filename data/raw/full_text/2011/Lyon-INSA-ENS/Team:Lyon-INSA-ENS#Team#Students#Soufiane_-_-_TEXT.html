Soufiane Boumahdi
As a student in biochemistry engineering at INSA, I first heard of Igem in 2007, when Endy Drew, Igem's founder came to INSA to promote this new competition in Europe. After two years thinking of this idea, I finally decided to join Igem Paris team in 2009 to enjoy this competition within an experienced team. Convinced that the department of Biosciences at INSA had the perfect tools to participate in this competition, mixing together an engineering background with strong microbiological and bio-informatics knowledge, I helped the emergence of a new team in 2010 and tried to share my experience of the competition with all the team members. After the success of team iGEM INSA Lyon 2010 (silver medal), I am very happy to be an advisor for team Lyon INSA-ENS in 2011.
