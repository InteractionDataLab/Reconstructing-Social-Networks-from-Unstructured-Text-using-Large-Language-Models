Corinne Dorel
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mecanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM 2011 is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
