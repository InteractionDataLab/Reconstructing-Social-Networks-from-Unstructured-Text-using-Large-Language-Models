Week 18
From Monday the 17th of October to Sunday the 23rd of October 2011
Monday
Strain construction
Extraction, EP Digestion and Gel electrophoresis of the NM522/p85 clones. They are all good.
Tuesday
Strain construction
Transformations : MC4100/pIG2+p150, MC4100/pIG6+p150. Some problems with the transformations were noticed (only few clones), caused probably by the fact that the TSS wasn't fresh, so a new solution has been made and used.
Wednesday
Strain construction
Transformations results : no clones for MC4100/pIG2+p150, MC4100/pIG6+p150.
Transformations: MC4100/p85, PHL1414+piG3.
Friday
Strain construction
A 5ml liquid cultured for 4 clones of PHL1414/pIG3 and 4 clones of MC4100/p85 is started.
Extraction and digestion by E and P. The four clones of MC4100/p85 are good.
