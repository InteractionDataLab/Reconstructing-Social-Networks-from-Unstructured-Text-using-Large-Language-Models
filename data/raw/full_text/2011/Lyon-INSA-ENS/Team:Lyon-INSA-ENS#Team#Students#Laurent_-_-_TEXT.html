Laurent Balvay
Graduated from the ENS Cachan, and after a first experience in research at Pasteur Institute in Paris on mRNA alternative splicing, I am currently working at the Human Virology Department (INSERM U758) in Lyon on issues in relation with translational control of viral proteins during an infection, and in particular control of the internal entry of ribosomes in the messenger RNA by RNA sequences called IRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site).
I am also a trainer to the aggregation of Life Sciences and Sciences of the Earth and the Universe. I have always had a passion for biological mechanics, and facing the enthusiasm of students, I have decided to accompany them in this international competition that represents iGEM.
