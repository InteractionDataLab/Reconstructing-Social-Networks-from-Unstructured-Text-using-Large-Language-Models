Julie Soula
Hi ! Being a student in Bioinformatics and Modeling department at INSA Lyon, this project represents a practice application of the notions we had studied during our formation. It allows us to realize the real stakes and problems raised by such a project. But this project also makes us discover a lot of things about biology, computer sciences, communication and all this in a fun team atmosphere and an international context ! I'm really happy to spend my summer with all these amazing students :)
