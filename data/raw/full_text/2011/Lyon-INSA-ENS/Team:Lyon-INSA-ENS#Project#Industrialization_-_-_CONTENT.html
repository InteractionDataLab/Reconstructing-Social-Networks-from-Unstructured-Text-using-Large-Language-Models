              Why not in the primary circuit ? (Experts advice)</FONT></P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>To include our project into a realistic approach</B> and close to concerns of today and tomorrow's engineers, <B>we notably have discussed the realization of our biofilter with M. Brette (Assistant professor in INSA Lyon, doctor in economic sciences) and our partners (Assystem, EDF)</B>. We also have a realistic idea of the technical difficulties thanks to the visits we made in nuclear installations (central of Tricastin, area of Centraco) and discussions we had with a Chemist of the nuclear power plant of Bugey.</P><P style="line-height:1.5em">
To get an industrial application technically realistic, our biofilter has to be designed as a modular innovation, what means that this solution can be applied without any major modification of the structure of the power plant or of the treatment center (plumbing, circuits of the different components, ...). Thus, design of the cartridge of the biofilter is fundamental to be able to be used into the circuit of nuclear effluents, then be treated as radioactive waste.<B style="line-height:1.5em">From those discussions we know that our <B>project is plausible and could interest industrialists</B> but some changes have to be made regarding the uses of our biofilters.</B></P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><BIG>1-  </BIG> Cobalt released during the opening of the nuclear reactor may represent <B>150 TeraBecquerel (TBq) of radioactivity</B> (500 m3 of contaminated water with a radioactive Cobalt estimated level of 300 gigaBq / m3).</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"> If the Cobalt biofilter is used as shown above, <B>dose rate for only 1 of the 150 TBq will represent 0,4 sievert per hour (Sv/h) whereas the authorized rate is up to 20 mSv per year</B>. </P><P style="line-height:1.5em ; text-align : center"> Calculation of dose rate:<B>Dose Rate = 0.54 * C * E * P / d²</B></P><P style="margin-left: 35%">

To treat 1TBq of Co60 with d = 1m (1TBq  = 30 Curie)

we can estimate Dose rate 
DR = (0.54 * 30 * 2.5) / 1²

This would involve a major modification of the structure of nuclear power plants.</P><P style="line-height:1.5em;margin-left : 35%">These changes involve too important costs as in France, <B style="line-height:1.5em">a modification in one power plant must be also done in the 58 other power plants of the nuclear fleet, for standardization and safety reasons.</B></P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><BIG>2-  </BIG> We also have to consider that during the conventional operation, <B>pressure in the primary circuit can reach up to 155 bars, and temperature up to 327°C (621°F)</B>.

At this stage of the project we could not assess the ability of the biofilter to capture cobalt particles.

Because of the implied technologies, ways and the potential risks, nuclear and electronuclear pattern are strategic fields. There are four sectors :
</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>The Upstream aims to supply centrals in nuclear fuel</B>. It groups together several links : mines (mining exploration and natural uranium extraction), chemistry (purification and conversion of uranium to uranium hexafluorure), enrichment (augmentation of isotope U235 content from 0,7% to 3-5%).
</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>The Construction put together conception, studies and engineering</B> for each project of central, fabrication of components, installation and starting of centrals.
</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>The operators of Exploitation are cautious about the well functioning of centrals daily</B>, and calibrate the power of  reactor according to the needs of electric network. Maintenance includes activities necessary for upkeep, modernization and extension of the lifetime of nuclear centrals. The outages are important points of this activity: indeed reactors are stopped sometimes during several weeks to refill  in fuel and large-scale maintenance operations.
</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>The Downstream</B> of the pattern is divided in two different activities: <B>used fuel</B> (recycling in MOX for a reuse), and life-ending of nuclear installations (dismantling, redevelopment of areas).
</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>Because of the huge financial and technological means</B> needed for the development of a business in the electronuclear field, <B>threat of new competitors (new businesses incoming into the market) is low</B>. Consequently, just a few large groups share the four lines of business, even at the world scale (for example AREVA, EDF, GE Energy or Mitsubishi). Suppliers, operators and customers inside the pattern are interconnected, and are quite often subsidiaries of these multinational companies. Competition is very strong because contracts are rare and huge.
</P><P style="line-height:1.5em"><B>Thus,sources of pressure on this field are numerous and varied</B>. Political influence on the electronuclear field is quite important: in France, nuclear holds a paramount place, but <B>politics can at any moment decide to favor other ways of electricity production, as in Germany (solar, wind turbines, etc.)</B>. Therefore role of public power in different countries and of international organizations (for example AIEA, ANDRA) is crucial, because those are the ones which will decide, fix rules and directives. The application of agreements against the global warming by public power (Kyoto, Copenhagen) can also impact directly and positively on the electronuclear field, this one giving out no CO2, to produce electricity. <B>However, there are currently two main problems: the becoming of nuclear wastes</B> (for now, stocking of wastes of low, medium and high activity), and <B>the risk of an accident whose consequences would be disastrous for environment and population</B>. Voted laws restrict this field to allow a permanent control, avoid accidents and protect populations. Indeed, from a social outlook, <B>the apprehension facing this strength and the different accidents which occurred is still present</B><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Lyon-INSA-ENS/Safety/Intro"> (Safety)</A>. Nevertheless, because of the increase of the price of fossil energies (petroleum, gas) and thanks to the researches on new generations of more efficient reactors, the electronuclear field keeps its competitiveness on the energy market.
