INSA : Institut National des Sciences Appliquées
INSA (see the website) : Institut National des Sciences Appliquées, which means National Institute for Applied Sciences is a network of five engineering schools in which students can enter after Baccalauréat (french "A" level). They are located in five important french cities : Lyon, Rennes, Toulouse, Rouen and Strasbourg.
Today, there are almost 52,000 engineers who graduated from INSA engineering schools. Specializations in various fields are proposed : chemistry, mechanics, civil, electric, and material engineering among others. They are public engineering schools.
INSA engineering school of Lyon is the oldest INSA. Its construction was quick and the courses started at the end of 1957. The first buildings were on a swamp. Then, the swamp has been gradually constructed with new buildings for room classes, accommodations and research laboratories. Today, INSA Lyon sets 12 different specializations after the 2 years of preparation classes.
The Community life is an important part of the INSA Student life. There are more than one hundred student associations. The students organize a lot of events like the Raid, the 24 hours of INSA,...Then, people can acquire scientific skills but they can also develop  human relations in order to become a complete engineer.
Students having great abilities in sports can enjoy rearranged timetables so that they can keep practicing their favorite sports. During their scientific education, other students choose to follow music, art, dance or theater classes. The international openness is not neglected either: there are four international sections which students can attend during the first two preparation years. Those special sections welcome students from all around the world :
Amerinsa (for the latino american area),
Asinsa (for the asian area),
Eurinsa (for the european area)
SCAN (most classes are taught in english).
There are about 30% of foreign students.
Our speciality: Biosciences, this departement is divided into two sections which are Biochemistry and Biotechnologies engineering, and Bioinformatics and Modelisation engineering. At the end of the five years in our school,  we graduate with a master of engineering in Biosciences.
It is one of the most recent department of the school and the smallest with less than 200 students. It was created at the request of Charles Mérieux then president of Biomerieux company, an important biochemical industry which was founded in Lyon.
