TU Delft Collaboration
Version Française
The TU Delft team also works on a part which can provide stickiness to E. coli. Thus, we have decided to collaborate to improve the results and characterization of our respective parts. Their project is about mussel glue and protein responsible of the attachement of mussel to rocks. The strength of this adherence, transposed to bacteria, could be an efficient way to fix bacteria on a support for various purposes, like the production of biofuels.
After an exchange of e-mails and a visioconference, we were able to find different ways to help each other.
We offered to reproduce each other's experiments, to validate the repeatability of our characterization tests. But also...
What we did for them
Both team had issues with a promoter existing in the registry, we have decided to synthesise a strong promoter (trc promoter) and to provide it to TU Delft team.
We have shared our stickiness characterization protocol in 24 well plate and by violet crystal in order to help them characterize their part.
What they did for us
With these protocols, they are able to repeat our experiment to confirm our results.
They provided us an access to their confocal microscope to get some detailed pictures of our sticky strain.
They offered us to use their model of adherence. However, after examining it, we realized this model was not adapted to our project.
