Hey Folks ! I am studying microbiology at the INSA of Lyon and it’s also my second participation in this amazing competition. After the silver medal last year with the INSA-Lyon team, I am happy to be part of the Lyon-INSA-ENS team and to help winning the gold medal ! Working hard in the Lab, meeting new people, sharing knowledge, and more important : having fun together, that’s iGEM for me !
