Mathilde Dumond
Hi,
I am an undergraduate student in fundamental biology, at the ENS of Lyon. It is the first time I am taking part in an iGEM team and I like to be in it. I am expecting much from this work, not only because everyone in the team invested a lot in, but also because it would be really nice to achieve the trip in Boston. I enjoy participating to the big picture of the iGEM: the creation of a bank of genes and concept, easily exportable, usable by everyone. For the future whatever the way it will end, this project helps me to realize how a research team works.
Don't forget to follow science, it's so exciting.
