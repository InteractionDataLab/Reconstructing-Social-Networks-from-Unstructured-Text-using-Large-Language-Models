Thomas Poinsot
Hi !
I'm a student in the fundamental biology department of the ENS Lyon, starting my master's degree in the fall. I've always been very interested in understanding the complex processes that make life what it is, and it seems to me that this iGEM project will help me towards this goal.  Furthermore, the social, and community-oriented aspect of this project will help me get better at working in a group environment : a skill that I'm sure will prove most useful during my academic career.
