Viviane Chansavang
As a student in the Biochemistry and Biotechnologies department at INSA Lyon, participating in the iGEM 2011 project is a great opportunity to work within a team to go beyond what we are taught in class, in a both fun and creative way. I believe that this can be a very positive experience for the future. Meeting people from all around the world throughout this competition is something that I am really looking forward to.
I enjoy travelling, learning languages, cooking (and eating), and practicing all kinds of sports (but especially volleyball as well as Beach volleyball).
