Margaux Jaulin
Hi! I'm margaux.
I will do my last year at INSA Lyon in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies.  I will also be doing a master at same time in Environment.  For me, iGEM is a good mean to work on team spirit, organisation, labwork, creativity...  I'm very happy to be part of the projet "Cobaltbuster".
I love meeting new people, learning about other cultures, and most of all traveling. That's why I'm very happy to meet  YOU  in Amsterdam and I hope to go to Boston !!!!
