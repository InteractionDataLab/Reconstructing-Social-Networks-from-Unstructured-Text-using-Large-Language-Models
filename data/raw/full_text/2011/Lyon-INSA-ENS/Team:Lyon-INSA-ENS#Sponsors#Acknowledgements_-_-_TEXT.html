Special thanks for special people
First, thanks to our patners, without them the project wouldn't have been possible.
We would also like to thank all the person who helped us with our project :
UMR5240 CNRS-UCBL-INSA-Bayer Crop Sciences: Microbiologie, Adaptation et Pathogénie, particularly, Véronique, Sylvie, Julien and Agnès for their help.
The University Claude Bernard, and especially the Laboratory of microbial ecology
UMR203 INRA-INSA: Biologie Fonctionnelle, Insectes et Interactions.
The Direction of Communication of the INSA de Lyon, especially Amélie Fioretta and Nathalie Falloni for the communication relative to INSA.
Joelle Pornin charged of the communications at the ENS for the communications relative to the ENS.
Olivier Brette, from Humanity Department of INSA de Lyon, for his advices in the economic analysis of the project.
Jean-Francois Pageaux, from Biosciences Department of INSA de Lyon, for his advices regarding statistics.
Nathalie Taillendier, who makes the order of all the products we use.
Bruno Cedat from the Rovaltain Center, technopole implied in the environmental protection.
Chun Chau Sze from the NTU Laboratory, who gave us a fluorescent strain (MG1655) and allowed us to use it for our experiment in the iGEM competition.( J Microbiol Methods. 2009 Feb;76(2):109-19. Epub 2008 Sep 24 )
For some aspects of our communication, thanks to Amanda Lo Van for editing the video of the "CROSS de l'INSA de LYON" and France3 Rhône-Alpes, Le Progrès, Radio RCF, Viva,... for broadcasting our project.
Thank to TU Delft for their collaboration and especially Krijn Warringa for making it possible.
Then, our project, close to industrial purposes, led us to deal with people from firms connected to the nuclear power plant industry. We are very grateful to the Tricastin nuclear power plant, Centraco, Michel from the Bugey Nuclear Power Station and Assystem for answering our questions and helping us to get our project closer to reality.
To conclude, we have to dedicate a really big thanks to the team INSA-LYon iGEM (2010)(check their wiki ). They engaged for the first time Lyon and its prestigious schools into the iGEM competition. Without them, the Lyon Biosciences team wouldn't exist.
Using their experience, we learned a lot and understood all the benefits to collaborate wih other people. In this aim, we create a partnership between the INSA de Lyon and the ENS de Lyon, everyone contributing by different ways to an unique project.
But the gathering between these two schools wouldn’t have been possible without the work of some of our supervisors! So, as students and advisors, we would like first to thank them for all the efforts! This collaboration is really rewarding for all the members of the team, as  on the scientific side than the human side.
