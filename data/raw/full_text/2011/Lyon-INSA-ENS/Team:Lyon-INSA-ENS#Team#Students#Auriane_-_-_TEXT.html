Auriane Kroiss
Graduated from INSA Lyon in 2010, I am doing a PhD on androgen regulated microRNAs in Prostate Cancer in Pr J. SAMARUT team “Functional Genomics of Nuclear Receptors”.
During my PhD, I have the opportunity to supervise students (lessons and practical work) and when I was asked to participate in this project, I was excited to work in this very interesting ecological topic for the international competition iGEM 2011.
