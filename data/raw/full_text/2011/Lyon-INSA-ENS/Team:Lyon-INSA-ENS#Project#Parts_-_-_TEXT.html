Our parts
Data for our favorite new parts
1. Main page - rcn-csgBAEFG, cobalt-inducible promoter controlling a curli-generating gene, BBa_K540000. This part enable production of cobalt induced curlis, which induces the formation of a biofilm.
2. Main page - rcn, cobalt-inducible promoter, BBa_K540001 . This promoter increases the production of a gfp placed under its control when cobalt is in the medium.
Data for pre-existing parts
1. Main page - ompR234, a stimulating gene for curli production, BBa_K342003 This part has been shown to induce adherence as well.
