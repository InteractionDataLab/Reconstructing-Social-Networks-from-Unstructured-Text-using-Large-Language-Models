Michaël Vonsy
Hi! I have just completed my first year in biochemistry and biotechnology at INSA of Lyon. It's my first year of participation to IGEM. I am excited participating to this contest, I think it's a great scientific and human  adventure which allows us to get more experience. I also take part to IGEM because it's a project led by students, which is the best way to apply what we learnt in class. Moreover our working on a subject which contributes to the preservation of the environment is a way to give a real meaning to our challenge.
