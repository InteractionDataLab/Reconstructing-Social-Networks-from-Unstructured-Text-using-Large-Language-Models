From Monday the 22th of August to Friday the 26th of August 2011
Monday
Transformations and controls for future tests
QIAGen extraction of NM522 and NM522+pIG4 and electrophoresis : no plasmid is in the strains.
A new NM522 strain is found in another lab.
Plating of 10µL of this new NM522 on LB
Transformation and plating of NM522 on LB with : pUC18 (=pIG6) (3 µL) + Amp, pIG25 (3 µL) + Cm
Transformation and plating of S19 on LB and the antibiotic Amp with : p157 (3 µL) + SpcR, p115 (3 µL) + SpcR, p127 (3 µL) + Kn, p116 (3 µL) + Kn
Results of Adherence Test - Result of Flocculation Test
Revealing of 24 well plates and flocculation test from 08.19.11. The (2) has failed. The others plates are quite good.
Re-synthetising csg-BAEFG with standard iGEM restriction sites
Digested the PCR result with both EcoRI and PstI.
Cloned the resulting DNA in pSB1C3.
Transformed the result in NM522 strain.
Creating the rcn-ompR234 part
Digested both our rcn part and the ompR part from last year's INSA iGEM team with respectively EcoRI, SpeI and XbaI, PstI.
Digested pB1C3 with both EcoRI and PstI.
3A ligation on those construct.
Transformation of a NM522 strain with the result of the ligation.
Others
Both NM522 and NM522/pIG24 grew on LB+Amp ( liquid and solid ) : antibiotic concentration in liquid was not sufficient, a more concentrated solution of Amp (10mg/mL which corresponds to 100X) is made and sterilized by filtration.
Creation of our own LB+Amp plates by plating 200µL of Amp on a LB plate.
Plating of several AmpS strains on the previous plates : PHL818, MC4100, NM522+pIG4, NM522 from the collection, NM522 from the previous LB+Amp plate, a new NM522 found in another lab.
Dissolution of 0.08g of Spectinomycin ( C14H24N2O7 + 2 HCl + 5 H20 ) into 5mL water and filtration to obtain a solution at 10mg/mL.
Tuesday
Transformations and controls for future tests
Start of 5mL liquid cultures of two clones for each plates obtained by the previous transformations, in order to check the presence of the right plasmids and start fluorescence tests.
