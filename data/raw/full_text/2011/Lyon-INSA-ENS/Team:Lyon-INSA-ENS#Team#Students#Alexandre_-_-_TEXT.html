Alexandre Duprey
I am a third year student in biochemistry and biotechnology at INSA Lyon. This project is, for me, a unique opportunity to participate in a research project. As my objective is to become a researcher, I hope this will be rewarding. But also, as iGEM is more than just experiments, to acquire different skills like how to look for sponsors, scientific communication... in an international context. All this will be enriching for me.
