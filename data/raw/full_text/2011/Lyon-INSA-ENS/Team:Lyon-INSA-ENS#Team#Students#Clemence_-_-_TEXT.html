Clémence Gonthier
Hi! I'm studying Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon. Participating in the iGEM competition is a huge opportunity. It enable me to learn more about Microbiology, do a whole research project from the research of information to the result presentation, work in team, have fun and live a great human adventure with students from all around the world !! I'm really proud to be part of the INSA-ENS-Lyon Team =)
