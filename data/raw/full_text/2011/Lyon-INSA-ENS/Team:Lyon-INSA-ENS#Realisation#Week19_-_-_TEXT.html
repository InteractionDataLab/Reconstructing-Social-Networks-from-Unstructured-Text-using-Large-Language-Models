Fluorescence Test - Cobalt induction selectivity
Studie of the induction of the pLac promoter by cobalt with a kinetic studie.
2 people are repeating the same 4 erlen of culture with the M63G medium:
- MC4100/p85 + amp + 25µM Co
- MC4100/p85 + amp
1 ml of ampicilline is added
The culture is sed by 1mL of a overnight preculture.
As the value of the fluorescent output should be null, an induction by IPTG will be done in order to check that the pLAc promoter is functionnal and that it is just non responsive to cobalt.
Results : No fluorescence has been mesured during this experiment showing out that the promoter pLac is non responsive to cobalt and that cobalt is selective to the rcn promoter.
