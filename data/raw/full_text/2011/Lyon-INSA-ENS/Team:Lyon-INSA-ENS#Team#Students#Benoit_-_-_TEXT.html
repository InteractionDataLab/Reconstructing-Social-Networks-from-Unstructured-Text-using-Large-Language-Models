Benoît Drogue
Graduated from the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in 2009 with a Research Master in “Microbiology and Ecology”, I am currently doing a PhD on Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria at the laboratory of Microbial Ecology of Lyon .
Within this framework, I have had the opportunity of supervising several trainees on ecological and bacterial genetics issues. Being mainly interested in ecological issues, my participation in the iGEM 2011 international competition is my own way of sharing skills in microbial genetics, ecology and to learn from my interaction with students in return.
