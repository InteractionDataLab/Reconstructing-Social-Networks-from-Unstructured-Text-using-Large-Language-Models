BBa_K561003
Characterization of BBa_I13602
This is an existing biobrick and we utilize this part in our device. An improved characterization is shown as follow.
The expression of CFP under aerobic and anaerobic conditions:
1
2
3
4
  The expressions of CFP under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions are increasing during the exponential phase. With it pTet promoter, which is constitutive, its expression intensity reaches high level. The highest expression intensity is 1.82 under anaerobic conditions and 1.69 under aerobic conditions. The PoPS of our device is 9.0269 under anaerobic conditions and 1.5055 under aerobic conditions.
Characterization of BioBrick BBa_K561003
The expression of CFP repressed by tetR which is expressed by subpart of BBa_K561000 or BBa_K561002:
