3rd Oct
18 Oct
Biofilm formation of AI2+rainbofilm device without induction of AI2 for 48 hours.
19 Oct
Co-transformation of AHL and rainbofilm device.
20 Oct
Observation of rainbofilm. Maximum thickness is 14 micrometer.
22 Oct
Biofilm formation with or without AI2 (by arabinose induction of part BBa_K091191) for 48, 36, 24 hours.
24 Oct
Laser confocal observation of biofilm. Used too much water to wash away salt crystals and although thick biofilm is observed before washing but very thin biofilm is observed under laser confocal.
25 Oct
Biofilm formation with rainbofilm DH5alpha without quorum sensing for 48 hours. Colony PCR of 20 JM109 AI2-rainbofilm co-transformaion. Non has rainbofilm plasmid successfully transformed.
26 Oct
18 AI2-rainbofilm JM109 and 20 AHL-rainbofilm DH5alpha colony PCR. Number 5,6,14 of AI2 and number 5,8,11 of AHL have both plasmids.
27 Oct
Biofilm formation with AI2, AHL induced in rainbofilm DH5alpha AHL, DH5alpha AI2 and JM109 AI2.
