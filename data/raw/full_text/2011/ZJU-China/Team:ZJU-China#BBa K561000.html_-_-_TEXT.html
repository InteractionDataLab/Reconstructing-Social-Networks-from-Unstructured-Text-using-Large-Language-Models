Characterization
The expression of YFP under aerobic conditions
1
2
  The expression of YFP under aerobic conditions is increasing during the exponential phase. With the micro-aerobic promoter, its expression intensity is very low. The highest expression intensity is 1.15. The PoPS of our device is 0.4506.
The expression of YFP under anaerobic conditions
1
2
  Pvgb is a micro-aerobic promoter and it contributes to high expression of YFP under micro-aerobic conditions. It’s expression level at anaerobic condition is relatively low. The PoPS of this device under anaerobic condition is -0.375.
The expression of YFP under micro-aerobic conditions (2.5% oxygen)
1
2
  The expression of YFP with 2.5% oxygen concentration can reach to a relatedly high level. With the micro-aerobic promoter (Pvgb), its expression intensity at the exponential phase is 1.28. The PoPS of our device at 2.5% oxygen level is 13.9023.
The expression of YFP under micro-aerobic conditions (10%)
1
2
  The expression of YFP with 10% oxygen concentration can reach to a relatedly high level. With the micro-aerobic promoter (Pvgb), its expression intensity at the exponential phase is 1.24. The PoPS of our device at 10% oxygen level is 2.0653
PoPS of YFP and the expression level of YFP
  The YFP expression device has a micro-aerobic promoter, Pvgb. Its PoPS reaches the highest when the oxygen concentration is 2.5%. Under anaerobic or aerobic conditions,its PoPS is equal to 0 relatively.
