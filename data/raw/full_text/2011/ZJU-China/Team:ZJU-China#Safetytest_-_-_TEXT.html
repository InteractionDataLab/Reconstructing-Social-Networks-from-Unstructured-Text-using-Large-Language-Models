Safety
Researcher safety
Our researchers mainly face regular bio-safety challenges in a molecular microbiology lab, such as risks staining DNA agarose gel with EB, extracting RNA from organisms with TRIZOL, and manipulating with DEPC treated water, etc. Any researchers conducting such experiment are instructed about the right method both by printed protocols and BIG BROTHER in the lab (XD). After the training, we must pass an on-line test about the lab safety, standard experiment procedure and lab waste treatment. During any experiments, necessary individual protections such as gloves and white robes are always required. Also, the public safety of the lab is guaranteed by the strict registering protocols on the operation of any apparatus. In order to make sure all the requirements above were followed well by the researchers and to get prepared for any emergency, our lab (also is the open bio-lab of the college) set up 24hr*7 camera system in the room.
Public safety
First we picked DH5α and JM109 as the two strains to use in our research. These are two non-pathogenic E. coli strain and do not pose problem to public health. The bio-parts we utilized are all security ensured, coding for florescence protein, cellulose degradation enzymes and metal ion binding proteins. Although bio-film formation is closely related to pathogenicity, our experiment enhances bio-film formation by changing external environment factors instead of modifying the nature of the bacteria. This is an important measure to assure that the bacteria do not acquire previously non-existing pathogenic capacity.
Environment safety
First of all, experiments conducted in our lab are with intensive concern of environmental impact. No media containing engineered germs go into the sewer before sterilization, and the waste of potentially toxic chemicals are collected and treated properly. During our research we have used antibiotic resistant plasmids, including chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin. Though risks of the practices exist, we believe that it's possible for us to use them safely with the mature protocols and techniques.
Biobrick safety
Our biobricks includes two new promoters responded to oxygen concentration, hence the regulation of the devices would not involve potentially bio-hazard chemicals. Also as partially described above, our parts express proteins aiming at binding of metal ions, degradation of cellulose, and the localization by fluorescent proteins. All of these products are not bio-hazard, and the expression is under fine control.
Local biosafety committee
Our experiment is designed and carried out following the standards of national biosafety office, especially the 《Safety Administration Regulation on Genetic Engineering》 (Only the chinese version is available online)
