Attribution and Contribution
About all the work of our projects has been done by undergraduate students. Here are  their code names at work. Flower=HUA Yijie; Xiaotong=YAO Xiaotong; Loli=HU Chenyue;  GeGe=XIA Yu; Kunkun=XI Yakun; Little Leaf=LI Ye; Mari=MA Lie; Little TianTian=TIAN  Luyi; Little QingQing=SUN Xiangqing; Marker=MA Keyue; Pidan=PI Ruoxi; Antelope=XU
Chenling; Celow=CHEN Xinlei
Parts Design:
Our parts are designed by Flower, and Antelope contributed by changing the anaerobic
promoter.
Parts Assembly
Pidan, Marker, GeGe, Little Leaf were mainly in charge of the parts assembly. Mari,
Antelope and Xiaotong also contributed.
Parts Characterization
This is a particular tedious job of which Pidan and Marker are mainly in charge of. Flower  and Mari have also undertaken a large amount of work. Data has been analyzed by
Marker and Loli.
Bioﬁlm Formation
   Antelope has designed the silicon tube and bubbling bioﬁlm formation system and Flower  the cell culture plate method. Observation including frozen slicing and microscopic  measurement have been done by Antelope, Pidan and Xiaotong. Bioﬁlm Stratiﬁcation  Flower, Antelope and Mari evaluated the bioﬁlm stratiﬁcation by laser confocal. Loli  analyzed the data using matlab.  Sub-project: Cellulose degradation Parts Design: These parts are designed by Marker and Little Leaf.  Parts Assembly: Little Leaf and GeGe have assembled parts concerning cellulose degradation.
Modeling
   Kunkun is in full charge of the modeling work. Many team members helped him in  clarifying the biological background.Website  Little Tiantian and Little QingQing have put together our beautiful webpage!
App
   Loli designed the game. Celow and Little QingQing did the coding. RUAN Zhangxia  did  the design.
Tools
   Loli designed the tool (as well) and wrote the matlab tool. Celow wrote the excel tool.
Novel
   With inspiration from Kunkun, Antelope wrote this novel and GeGe has drawn the  illustrations.
Funding
   Loli and Marker designed a survey and wrote a funding analysis and guide for future  teams.
