3rd Sep
Directly use DH5α fdhF+RFP colony to inoculate silicone tube set with 5ml LB. rest for 12h for biofilm attachment.
4th Sep
Add 50mlLB+Amp and start circulation.
6th Sep
Biofilm with direct inoculation is optimum. Expressed red florescence but only one small fraction of the biofilm remained after cutting off the part of the tube.
12th Sep
4 silicone tube sets with biofilm attachement time of 3h, 5h, 7.5h and 10h; 4 bubbling sets.
15th Sep
The silicone tube set with 3h of attachment achieves optimum biofilm formation. Bubbling sets glass slides are froze in -80℃ for later observation with laser confocal. Biofilm formed on glass slide is about 10μm thick.
16th Sep
New sets with silicone tube, a mixture of RFP, CFP and YFP expressing e.coli. Attachment 3h.
17th Sep
Glass slide with bubbling set with the same mixture of e.coli.
Place two filter film on solid culture medium and placed the mixture of e.coli on the filter to form gas-solid interface biofilm.
20th Sep
Observation of glass slide and gas-solid biofilm under laser confocal. Glass slide are observed directly and gas-solid biofilm is first pressed by a covering slide so that it would stick to it and peeled off from the filter for observation.
Biofilm on glass slide is about 8.6μm thick. Biofilm formed on gas-solid interface is too concentrated in bacteria and culture medium that the florescence of too strong to see any clear structure.
