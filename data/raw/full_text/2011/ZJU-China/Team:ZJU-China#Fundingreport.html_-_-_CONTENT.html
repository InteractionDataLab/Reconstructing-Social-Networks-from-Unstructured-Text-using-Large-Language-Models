all around the world. From Asia to Africa, Europe to America, new iGEM
teams coming from various backgrounds emerge and merge into iGEM's big
family. Such development process is like many other processes in this
world, including population explosion and the growth of bacteria we have
every day in the lab. Though the expansion of iGEM may seem infinite at
this moment, it may soon reach its saturation level following the
well-known Logistic model.</P><P>We've first collected the data of participating team numbers each
year from 2004 to the present both worldwide and in each region (Asia,
Europe and America). Then we fitted the data with logistic model and
obtained each parameter value as follows.</P><DIV id="banner"><UL><LI class="on">1</LI><LI>2</LI><LI>3</LI><LI>4</LI></UL></DIV><P>Parameter N in logistic model represents the capacity of the
region to accommodate iGEM teams, while r indicates the expasion rate of
iGEM teams. In bacteria growth, the capacity of the environment is
defined by a limiting factor, such as nutrition resources. The case for
iGEM cannot be more similar. The limited nutrition resource in our case
is the financial support for iGEM teams. No iGEM team can survive
without proper funding. Moreover, funding may be dependent on factors
such as the biotech industry and government investment in the field of
synthetic biology. It's actually intuitive that the development of
synthetic biology determines the funding resources, which control the
fate of iGEM teams.</P><P>When development of synthetic biology is in its steady state,
funding resources are almost fixed and are centered about certain level.
With the assumption that the survival of team must depend on funding,
the fixed funding resources couldn't support every team. Therefore, in
contrast with an unlimited increasing number of iGEM teams, the
participating team number would also be fixed around certain level.</P><P>However, with the emergence of regional jamboree, the current
status and capacity might change. Just as what iGEM organizers have
always said, that jamboree held in regions can host more iGEM teams.
It's true that by splitting teams into three regions, now iGEM
competition would be able to accommodate teams nearly as three folds as
before. However, a more significant impact is actually on the side of
iGEM teams. Jamboree held in regions could greatly cut down expenses for
each team, thus the same amount of funding resource can now support more
teams for participation.</P><P>To use our team expenses as an example, going to a world jamboree
is almost four times more expensive than going to a regional jamboree.
Suppose that as much as forty percent of regional iGEM teams would
advance to the World Jamboree, the expectation of traveling and
registering expenses for all iGEM teams would be</P><P>As jamboree expenses accounted for more than seventy percent of
the whole team's budget, the expectation of budgets for all iGEM teams
would be</P><P>Thus, besides other impacts, regional jamboree is economic and
offers more seats for iGEM teams. The modified predictions of iGEM
growth, considering the economic impact of regional jamboree, are shown
below.</P><DIV id="banner1"><UL><LI class="on">1</LI><LI>2</LI><LI>3</LI><LI>4</LI></UL></DIV><P>However, grouping teams into regions can bring some funding
problems too. For instance, some Chinese university departments offer
funding only on the basis of the team's advancement to the world
jamboree. Failure at the regional not only may fail to make ends meet,
but also may be deadly to a young team's future funding prospect. As our
recent survey result shows that the funding organization very likely
attaches great importance to the team's competition history.</P><P>To solve the funding problem, there're clearly two main
directions in front of us:</P><P>(1) The overall funding in society for iGEM projects or teams can
be increased by further developing biotechnology and raising public
awareness of synthetic biology. The former can be promoted a little by
doing good iGEM projects, which should be of some value to the field or
society instead of just having some fun. Human practice is surely one of
the keys to the latter. For instance, our team's theme of human practice
this year is to educate through entertainment, which creates a more
relaxing and fun environment for the public to get to know synthetic
biology.</P><P>(2) In order to advocate more iGEM teams in participation each
year, instead of finding potential funding, one can also try to cut down
team expenses. The economic impact of regional jamboree illustrated
above might be a good example. Furthermore, through entrepreneurship,
teams may also be able to keep balance by applying each year's project
to industry and actually making profits out of it. Yet, not every team
can be as fortunate and successful as that. Finally, speaking from a
participating iGEM team, it'd save a lot if registration fees are lower
and if iGEM organizers could negotiate with hotels and airlines to offer
iGEM teams a lower sales prize.</P><P>Funding may not occur to be that big of a problem in regions
where biotechnology industry prospers and develops rapidly. Yet sadly
it's not the case in many other regions in the world. To engage more
young intelligent people in synthetic biology and realize what they
dream for, we should help each other out on the funding issue.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV style="display: none" class="frame" id="rightnav"><DIV class="bgcolors" id="round"><P><A name="jumptop" id="bb">  Biobrick Group </A>|<A id="bf"> Biofilm Group  </A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="links"><A href="#top2">Top</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer" id="footer"><A href="https://2011.igem.org/">
