BBa_K561004 Sequence And Features
<partinfo>BBa_K561004 SequenceAndFeatures</partinfo>
In the Sugarfilm expression system, BBa_K561004 is designed for bottom layer expression, conducting the first step of cellulose degradation. It is based on Rainbofilm bottom layer BioBrick BBa_K561002 , with substitution of mRFP ( BBa_E1010 ) by Cex and CenA. The sequence is under regulation of anaerobic promoter fdhF, and the TetR expression would repress upper-layer device (Ptet regulated) in anaerobic condition, i.e. in the bottom-layer condition.
 
BBa_K561005 SequenceAndFeatures
<partinfo>BBa_K561005 SequenceandFeatures</partinfo>
BBa_K561005 is designed for medium layer expression, conducting the conversion of cellubiose into glucose. It is based on Rainbofilm bottom layer BioBrick BBa_K561000 , with substitution of eYFP ( BBa_E0030 ) by BglX. The sequence is under regulation of micro-aerobic promoter vgb, and the TetR expression would repress upper-layer device (Ptet regulated) in micro-anaerobic condition, which mostly exists in the middle part of the biofilm.
Coding sequence with regulation of Ptet would be suitable as the   upper-layer device (such as BBa_I13602 used in   Rainbofilm system). Expression of the device would be repressed either   in the bottom or medium layer, and would do its job faithfully in the   upper-layer region.
