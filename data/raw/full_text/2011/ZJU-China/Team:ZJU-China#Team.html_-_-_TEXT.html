Our Team
We are a young and happy team of 13 scientists and engineers from very diverse backgrounds.Although this is our first year working on a wet lab project and biofilm experiments are new to us, we're currently taking great efforts to build the whole system for experiments.Our team progress and more info will be frequently updated so that our iGEM experience could be shared as much as possible along the way. We truly welcome you to contact us for any cooperation or suggestion.

Ye Li, A Junior majored in Biological Sciences. This is my second time participating iGEM, and I learned a lot during the whole process. To me, iGEM is fascinating because it provides an opportunity of independent project design and experiment as well as the chance to meet friends and learn from many great minds. Hope we can get ideal results this year! ZJU-China ROCKS!

Luyi Tian, As a junior student majors in Bioinfomatics,I am interested in computer programming,system biology.Taking pictures is my special hobby.
Xiangqing Sun, My major is EE. I mainly work on software and wiki. I'm very glad to be an iGEMer. I like soccer, Apple and music.
I'm Keyue Ma, a junior student majoring Biological Science. I'm responsible for the daily issues of our team and in charge of part of wet-lab experiments. I'm now in the cancer lab, researching cancer gene function and signal transduction. I'm fond of badminton and singing. In our team, I'm enjoying the fun Synthetic Biology and iGEM bring me!
Ruoxi Pi, An odd girl who takes performing experiments as the only hobby.
Chenling Xu, What would you do to have your e.coli crowding together on a surface instead of swimming freely around? Well I tried swirling them around, bubbling at them, forcing them to go into a thin rubber tube, or a glass one… Our project do need these little creatures to make some sacrifice and I am the one who carried out the executions. Mouhaaahaaa~~~
