Synthetic Biology Club
Last year was the first time for Zhejiang University to participate in iGEM competition. After coming back to school with our first Gold Medal, we decided to promote synthetic biology and attract more students fond of synthetic biology in school. Then we established the Synthetic Biology Club (SBC).
The Synthetic Biology Club aims to promote the development of synthetic biology in our school and encourage more students to have a basic understanding of iGEM as well as synthetic biology. We held several lectures for not only the club members but also students from different colleges. One of the ex-participant of ZJU-China 2010, WANG Shaohua, introduced synthetic biology and the aims of iGEM. In May, instructor of Peking_R, ZHANG Haoqian came to our university and had a close talk with new members of ZJU-China 2011. Furthermore, he held a lecture concerning the projects of Peking2010 and the significance of quantification of biology.
In winter vacation, we organized club members to form groups freely and to design one or more detailed projects of their interests concerning synthetic biology. In the beginning of March, each group gave a presentation to all other club members to introduce their project plan, and most importantly their original ideas. Most of the club members became more interested in synthetic biology and iGEM. Some of them even remarked that it's one of the best academic experiences they ever had in college.
Thanks for all the activities held by Synthetic Biology Club, iGEM and synthetic biology have attracted more and more attention in our campus. It's an amazement that so many students have expressed their wills to participate in iGEM2012.
