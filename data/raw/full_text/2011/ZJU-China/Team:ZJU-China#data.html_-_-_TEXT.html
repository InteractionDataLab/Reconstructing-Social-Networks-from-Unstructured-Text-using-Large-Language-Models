Biofilm Formation
 
Figure 1
The figure shows the modified DH5alpha's biofilm formed on rubber tube.  The pink color was due to the RFP expressed by the bacteria.  The picture was obtained with Leica DME microscope, under 40X objective.
Figure 2
3D CLSM picture of the biofilm formed by E. Coli DH5alpha. The picture was obtained with Zeiss LSM 710NLO confocal laser scanning microscope, using a 20X objective.  The colors of the biofilm were not from the fluorescence proteins but artificially added in order to give better resolution.
Figure 3
CLSM image of the stratified biofilm obtained with the Cell Culture Plate Method. It was formed by our modified E.Coli expressing device BBa_K561003 (you can refer to our Rainbofilm module for more information). The picture was taken by Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope, using a 63? oil-immersion objective.
