Background
So far synthetic biologists have made tremendous effort in and below the cell level, such as manipulating gene regulations, modifying the metabolic pathways or producing specific proteins. However, engineering work done in higher levels remains rare. This year, ZJU-China has been focusing on the tissue level; we want to make cells differentiated within a natural bacteria ‘tissue’, biofilm.

FIG. 1 Patterns of DNA synthesis in S.     epidermidis colony biofilms. Panel A shows an unlabeled (no BrdU) colony biofilm probed with     antibody. Panel B shows a colony biofilm labeled with BrdU under aerobic     conditions. Panel C shows a colony biofilm labeled with BrdU under     anaerobic conditions. Panel D shows a colony biofilm labeled with BrdU     in an environment of pure oxygen. Green areas are due to BrdU     incorporation into DNA and indicate active replication. Red areas are     due to rhodamine B counterstaining that reveals the extent of the     biomass independent of its activity. In each image, the membrane     interface of the colony is on the bottom and the air interface is on the     top.

FIG. 2 Patterns of DNA synthesis in S. epidermidis drip-flow (A) and capillary (B) biofilms and overlay of DNA synthetic activity and protein synthetic activity in the same S. aureus     colony biofilm (C and D)‏. In panels A and B, green areas are due to BrdU labeling and red     areas are due to rhodamine B counterstain. In panel A, the substratum     was on the bottom and the air interface was on the top. Flow was from     top to bottom in panel B. In panel C, green areas are due to GFP     expression and red areas are due to BrdU labeling. In panel C, the     substratum was on the bottom, with the air interface on the top. Panel D     shows the average fluorescence intensity along a linear transect across     the section for the two signals. The position indicated on the x axis is     arbitrary. The intensities indicated on the y axis of panel D are     arbitrary as they result from automatic scaling by the digital image     acquisition system.
Biofilm is a complex self-organized bacteria community with special spatial structure. One thing interesting about it is that from the surface to the bottom, the bacteria maintain different physiological states in a layered fashion. Both DNA synthesis and protein expression is highly stratified within the biofilm. (Fig.1, Fig.2, Philip S. Stewart, 2007) These varied layers can be characterized by gradients in the concentrations of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic waste products. The external differences result in the differentiation of gene transcription and protein expression patterns. Among all the factors, oxygen is the most well studied one. (E. Werner, 2004).

FIG.3 Oxygen concentration profiles for P. aeruginosa colony biofilms. Triplicate data sets are shown for each strain. Depth zero on the x axis corresponds to the air-colony interface.
We used different oxygen concentrations within the biofilm as signals to induce the expression of different proteins and thus created a new expression stratification system, as is indicated by the name ‘Rainbofilm’. It’s also the first attempt to utilize and modify bacteria biofilm as an extracellular scaffold. Besides, biofilm’s adaptability and resistance to environmental stress give our Rainbofilm a natural edge as a new application in synthetic biology.
