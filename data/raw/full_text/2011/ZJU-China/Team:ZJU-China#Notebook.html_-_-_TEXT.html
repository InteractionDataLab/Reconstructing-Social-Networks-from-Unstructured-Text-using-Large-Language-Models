Within each compartment are components: include different types of biomass ,substrates , products. biomass is often divided into active microbial species, inert cells, and extracellular polymeric substances(EPS).
The components can undergo transformation, transport, and transfer processes. For example, substrate is consumed, and this leads to the synthesis of new active biomass.
All process affecting each component in each compartment are mathematically linked together into a mass balance equation that contains rate terms and parameters for each process.
Model Selection:Many kinds of Mathematics models have been founded to describe a system of biofilm. Models of different dimensions (1d, 2d, 3d) focus on different properties of a biofilm. Since we care most about the oxygen concentration gradients perpendicular to the substratum, numerical 1-dimensional dynamic model(N1) would be a proper choice for us.
 
Early July
Pre-experiments with biofilm formation with circular and non circular silicone tube, 24 well plate on different support including glass, paper, plastic film, rubber. The final material are used based on the easiness biofilm form on them and on the easiness to observe under microscope.
 
28th July
13.30: DH5α 11p 5mlX4
23.00: silicone tube set at 37℃ /p>
29th July
13.00: LB culture 50ml with circular culture medium. LB culture 50ml with noncircular culture medium.
31st July
13.00: -80℃ storing silicone tube. A thick white and loosely bond substance is seen on the inner wall of the 5mm silicone tube, and on the inner wall of the 1mm silicone tube a flatter and smoother white substance. Especially obvious where the tube turns. Possibly because the speed of culture flow is slower.
