Team Collaboration
Yizhi CAI from Johns Hopkins visiting our team
 
  Yizhi CAI, the instructor for Johns Hopkins iGEM Team and one of the organizers for iGEM, visited our team in late May.23rd. He introduced his Yeast Genome 2.0 Project to us and then discussed some related issues and problems of regional jamboree. In turn, we’ve briefly introduced our team and team project to him. The visit certainly broadened our view of synthetic biology, of other iGEM teams and of the competition itself as well. And more importantly, the visit brought us much closer to iGEM and built the bridge between ZJU and Johns Hopkins.
Haoqian ZHANG from Peking University visiting our team
 
  Haoqian ZHANG, the instructor for this year’s Peking iGEM Team and a former iGEMer, came to visit our team in early May.7th. He first gave a lecture introducing synthetic biology to synthetic biology club members in ZJU, as part of the College of Life Sciences Festival activity. He then introduced Peking iGEM team and projects, and held a wonderful discussion with us. We learned a lot not only from his introductions, but from himself as well. The visit has no doubt built a close relationship between Peking University and ZJU iGEM teams.
iGEM 2011 China Meet-up in USTC
  The iGEM2011 China Meetup was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th. Seven members of ZJU-China, Ye LI, Keyue MA, Ruoxi PI, Chenlin XU, Yakun XI, Yu XIA and Luyi TIAN participated in this event. During the conference, we introduced our ‘Rainbofilm’ project as well as our experiment progress. We also discussed experiments and team organizing experiences with members
from many other China iGEM teams. Haoqian ZHANG from Peking_R iGEM team kindly helped us with problems we met during our experiments.
