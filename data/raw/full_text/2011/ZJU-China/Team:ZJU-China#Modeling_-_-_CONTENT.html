</P><P id="intro"><STRONG>Model Selection:</STRONG>Many kinds of Mathematics models have been founded to describe a system of biofilm. Models
of different dimensions (1d, 2d, 3d) focus on different properties of a biofilm. Since we care most
about the oxygen concentration gradients perpendicular to the substratum, <STRONG>numerical
1-dimensional dynamic model(N1)</STRONG> would be a proper choice for us.</P><DIV class="block" id="compartment"><H3>Compartment</H3><P><STRONG>The biofilm:</STRONG>A biofilm is a gel-like aggregation of microorganisms and other particles embedded in
extracellular polymeric substances. A biofilm contains water inside it, but its main physical
characteristic is that it is a solid phase. A biofilm normally is anchored to a solid surface called the
substratum on one side and in contact with liquid on its other side. Frequently, a mass-transfer
boundary layer is included between the bulk liquid and the biofilm itself. Thus, following figure
illustrates a biofilm having four compartments: the substratum, the biofilm itself, the boundary
layer, and the bulk liquid outside of the biofilm. While it is complex even for a homogeneous biofilm morphology, we assume the biofilm surface is flat and all material below the maximum biofilm thickness as part of the biofilm components, and they have a constant density.</P><P><STRONG>the mass-transport boundary layer</STRONG>Experimental observations clearly indicate strong concentration gradients for solutes just
outside the biofilm when these solutes are utilized or produced by the microorganisms in the
biofilm. Consequently, the solute concentrations at the biofilm surface and in a completely
mixed bulk liquid often are significantly different.So we introduce the mass-transport boundary layer,which is a hypothetical layer of liquid above the biofilm and
in which all the resistance to mass transport of dissolved components outside the biofilm
occurs.</P><P><STRONG>The bulk liquid:</STRONG> In our experiments, the bulk liquid is large compared to the biofilm. So the simplest way seems to consider it as a boundary condition of the biofilm compartment and specify the concentrations of dissolved. However, dissolved components can exchange between the biofilm and the bulk liquid, and it has a profound impact on the concentrations in the bulk liquid. Thus we include the bulk liquid not only as a boundary condition, but also as a separate, completely mixed compartment, varying according to the inflow, outflow, and the exchanges with the biofilm.</P><P><STRONG>The substratum:</STRONG> In our basic model, the substratum is a separate compartment and impermeable. So it does not have much effect on the biofilm system. However in some bioreactor, the substratum may be permeable, or include organic solids that are biodegraded by attached microorganisms.
</P></DIV><DIV class="block" id="component"><H3>Component</H3><P><STRONG>Dissolved components:</STRONG> There are two kind of dissolved components in our model, one is oxygen, the other is substrates where nutrients are inside. They are expressed by inflow concentration of oxygen, inflow concentration of substrates and monod half saturation constant for substrates, monod half saturation constant for oxygen.Diffusion coefficient of oxygen and diffusion coefficient of substrate are also used to characterize the property of these components.</P><P><STRONG>Particulate components:</STRONG> In our model, the particulate components are microbes and EPS. We assume that they are homogeneously mixed in the same proportion in all parts of the biofilm. So can use bacterial density to relate the amount of bacterial and the volume it takes up. And the volume fraction of EPS in Bacterial is specified by a constant.
</P></DIV><DIV class="block" id="process"><H3>Process</H3><P><STRONG>Transformation processes</STRONG> usually are biochemical reactions that produce or consume one or
more components: e.g., consumption of substrate, production of metabolic end-products,
microbial growth and decay, and production of EPS.</P><P>The<STRONG> transport processes</STRONG> that regularly are considered in biofilm models are advection,
molecular diffusion, and turbulent dispersion. In special cases, transport of charged
components by migration in an electric field created is included. The general, 1d expression
to model the specific mass flux of a component is calculuted in the direction z</P><P><STRONG>Transfer processes</STRONG> exchange mass of dissolved or particulate components between two
compartments. At the interface between the compartments, a continuity condition for the
component concentration C and the specific flux j of the exchanged mass must be fulfilled.
Continuity means that C and j are the same on both sides of the interface between the
compartments. C and j can be calculated at each side of the interface from boundary
conditions</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="block" id="mmodeling"><H3>Modeling</H3><A name="jumpmodeling"> </A><P><STRONG>An introduction to N1 model:</STRONG></P><P>The core of the N1 model consists of a system of stiff, non-linear partial differential
equations. Because of the stiffness of the equation system, integration methods tailored for
stiff systems must be used, or the dissolved and the particulate components have to be treated
differently. Furthermore, biofilm growth, i.e., the displacement of the
interface between biofilm and bulk liquid, creates a so-called moving boundary problem
(Kissel et al. 1984; Wanner and Gujer 1986).We performed simulations with the N1 model
 using the software package AQUASIM (Reichert 1998a, 1998b), since it can
handle stiff systems and the moving boundary. The N1 model implemented in AQUASIM is
described in next Section.</P><P>The processes considered in the model include:</P><UL><LI>many transformation processes</LI><LI>advection and diffusion of attached particulate components in the biofilm solid
matrix</LI><LI>attachment and detachment of particulate components at the biofilm surface and in
the biofilm interior</LI><LI>diffusion of suspended particulate and dissolved components in the biofilm liquid
phase and in the liquid boundary layer at the biofilm surface</LI><LI>complete mixing of suspended particulate and dissolved components in the bulk
liquid</LI></UL><P><STRONG>Definitions and equations</STRONG></P><P>As discussed above, biofilms are multiphase systems. Consequently, in the N1 model three
different phases are distinguished. The solid attached phase is made up by the particulate
components, which form the biofilm solid matrix. In the model of single species of bacteria, the
particulate components are assumed to be uniform, defined as</P><P>where<STRONG> X_M</STRONG> is the concentration of the attached component, <STRONG>ρ</STRONG> is its density , defined as the mass
divided by the volume of the cell or particle, and<STRONG> ε</STRONG> is its volume fraction, defined as volume of
the component per unit biofilm volume. The porosity or biofilm pore volume fraction<STRONG> θ </STRONG>is</P><P>The pore volume is formed by two phases: the phase of the suspended particulate components
with concentrations<STRONG> X_P </STRONG>and the biofilm liquid phase, with the liquid phase volume fraction
<STRONG>ε_liquid:</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mass balances in biobilm models</STRONG></P><P>Conservation of mass of a component in a dynamic and open system states that:</P><P>The local mass balances are differential equations that express the variation of concentration of a
component in time in a point in space as a result of transport and transformation processes.
One-dimensional mass balance equations for attached particulate, suspended particulate, and
dissolved components can be derived from the general mass balance if gradients are considered
only in the direction of z, perpendicular to the substratum</P><P>where<STRONG> t </STRONG>is time;<STRONG> z </STRONG>is perpendicular coordinates ;<STRONG> S </STRONG>is the concentration;<STRONG> j </STRONG>is the mass flux along the
perpendicular coordinates; and<STRONG> r </STRONG>is the net production rate of the component. For a dissolved
substrate<STRONG> S_i</STRONG>, the specific mass flux<STRONG> j_i </STRONG>in the biofilm, can be modeled by Fick’s first law of
diffusion as</P><P>Where<STRONG> D_i </STRONG>is the molecular diffusivity of substrate in the biofilm. Substituting this equation into
the equation (1) yields a mass balance equation that describes the development in time and the
spatial profile in the biofilm of the concentration<STRONG> S_i </STRONG>of a dissolved substrate as</P><P>where<STRONG> r_i </STRONG>is the net production rate of<STRONG> S_i</STRONG>. Equation (3) has the boundary condition</P><P>at the substratum (<STRONG>z=0</STRONG>) and</P><P>at the biofilm–bulk liquid interface (<STRONG>z=LF</STRONG>), where LF is the biofilm thickness and <STRONG>S_LF</STRONG>, <STRONG>i</STRONG> is
the substrate concentration at the biofilm surface. All terms in equation (6) are given as substrate
mass per unit biofilm volume. Equations (6) to (8) also hold for suspended particulate
components, i.e., for cells or particles which are suspended in the biofilm pore volume and have
the concentration<STRONG> X_P</STRONG>.</P><P>For attached particulate components, which form the biofilm solid matrix, transport is assumed
to be the result of microbial growth and decay in the biofilm. Growing or shrinking cells lead to a
volume expansion or contraction of the biofilm solid matrix, respectively, and to a displacement
of neighboring cells (Wanner 1989). This displacement can be interpreted as advective transport
and is formally described as a specific mass flux<STRONG> j_M </STRONG>by</P><P>where<STRONG> u_F </STRONG>is the distance by which the cells are displaced per unit time. The displacement
velocity<STRONG> u_F </STRONG>of a cell at the location z is equal to the added net specific mass production of the
cells the biofilm matrix between the substratum and this location:</P><P>where<STRONG> r_M </STRONG>is the net production rate of a particulate component in the biofilm matrix. Based on
equations (9), with<STRONG> u_F </STRONG>as defined in (10), a mass balance analogous to equation (6) can be
derived and used to describe the development in time and the spatial profile in the biofilm of the
attached particulate component:</P><P>The boundary condition is no-flux condition:</P><P>at the substratum. Equation (11) is used to calculate the relative abundance, spatial distribution,
and development in time of microbial species and particles in the biofilm.</P><P>The development of the biofilm thickness in time is the result of the net production of biomass in
the biofilm, as described by equation (10), of the attachment at the biofilm surface of microbial
cells and particles suspended in the bulk liquid, and of the detachment of microbial cells and
particles from the biofilm surface to the bulk liquid. It is modeled as</P><P>where<STRONG> u_de </STRONG>and<STRONG> u_at </STRONG>are the detachment velocity and the attachment velocity, respectively.
The velocity<STRONG> u_de </STRONG>yields a phenomenological description of the decrease of the biofilm thickness
per unit time as result of the detachment process, i.e., erosion or sloughing.</P><P>Attachment refers to the adsorption of microbial cells suspended in the bulk liquid to the
biofilm surface and is modeled by an attachment velocity as</P><P>where <STRONG>k</STRONG> is the attachment rate coefficient and <STRONG>X_L</STRONG> is the concentration at the bulk liquid side of
the biofilm surface of the suspended particulate component.</P><P>The environment of the biofilm is modeled as a completely mixed volume of water, termed bulk
liquid. Conversion processes in the bulk liquid can be equally important as those that take place
in the biofilm. For each dissolved and particulate component considered, an additional mass
balance equation of the form</P><P>is needed, where <STRONG>C_in</STRONG>,<STRONG>i</STRONG> and <STRONG>C_B</STRONG>,<STRONG> i </STRONG>are the influent and bulk liquid concentrations, respectively, of
the dissolved or suspended particulate component<STRONG> i</STRONG>,<STRONG> V_B </STRONG>is the bulk liquid volume,<STRONG> Q </STRONG>is the rate
of flow through the bulk liquid,<STRONG> A_F </STRONG>is the biofilm surface area,<STRONG> j_F</STRONG>,i is the mass flux across the
biofilm surface , and<STRONG> r_B</STRONG>,<STRONG>i</STRONG> is the production rate of the component.</P><P><STRONG>Transformation processes</STRONG></P><P>In modeling, the transformation processes are represented mathematically with rate expressions,
or equations that tell how fast the component is produced or consumed. The rate is proportional
to the concentrations of one or more of the components and one or more kinetic parameters.
We describe the synthesis of microbial biomass with the Monod equation for one limiting
substrate:</P><P>where<STRONG> μ </STRONG>is the specific growth rate, <STRONG>μ_max</STRONG> the maximum specific growth rate,<STRONG> S </STRONG>is the
concentration of the rate-limiting substrate, and<STRONG> K_S </STRONG>is the concentration giving one-half the
maximum rate.</P><P>When multiple substrates are rate limiting, the Monod equation typically is extended to include
the effects of each substrate influencing the rate of microbial synthesis. For instance, is the rate
of microbial synthesis may be limited by the concentrations of the electron donor (S_1, e.g. COD)
and the electron acceptor (<STRONG>S_2</STRONG>, e.g. Oxygen) then the specific growth rate can be described with
a multiplicative-Monod expression (Bae and Rittmann 1996):</P><P>Synthesis is not the only transformation process relevant to microorganisms in a biofilm.
Indeed, the microorganisms undergo a number of loss processes, including endogenous decay (or
inactivation), predation, and detachment. The inactivation process is common in almost any
biofilm and serves as a model for how to express a biomass-loss process.</P><P>Synthesis is not the only transformation process relevant to microorganisms in a biofilm. Indeed,
the microorganisms undergo a number of loss processes, including endogenous decay (or

utilization of a substrate is what brings about biomass synthesis, the rate of substrate utilization
