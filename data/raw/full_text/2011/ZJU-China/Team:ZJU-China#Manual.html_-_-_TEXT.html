Funding Manual
Through the survey analysis, we've summarized the following funding experiences for sharing:
1. Applying for funding as early as possible
Through our survey, most of the successful funding applications are early (from Feb. to June). So don't wait until summer vacation!
2. Look around yourself first
We found that a large portion of funding was obtained through someone very near to us. Check out labs or institutions around and find help from professors or school officials first, before going off to ask help from someone you've never met before.
3. Things need to be prepared before application
The requirements for different funding application may vary, yet here's a list commonly used from former funding experiences:
• A detailed plan for both your iGEM project and competition, describing your motivation and your approaches for the project
• A detailed schedule (daily basis) for your team's project and experiment (required by some sponsors)
• A detailed budget, illustrating how much your team needs and how you prepare to use the money
• A summary of your team's history, showing your team's previous activities and achievements (not applicable to new teams)
• A 10-15min presentation, introducing project and team (when talk or interview is scheduled)
• A presentation or a small pamphlet, introducing synthetic biology and iGEM (important especially for first-year teams)
• A detailed plan for organizing activities in campus (depending on the sponsor's interests)
4. Telling everybody about iGEM and synthetic biology
A sponsor will only give funding when he trusts what he's investing. It's important to make synthetic biology and iGEM known to more people in this world. Don't wait until you need funding, do you start to tell people how amazing synthetic biology is.
