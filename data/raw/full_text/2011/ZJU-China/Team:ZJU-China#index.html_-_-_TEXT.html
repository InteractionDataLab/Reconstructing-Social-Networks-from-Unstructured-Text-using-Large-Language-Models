What's New
Rainbofilm Extension
We extend the current primitive stratification system into a more precise, more controllable, and more versatile device. We start with improving the input signals of the rainbofilm system by Fine-tuning the stratification pattern and Changing the differentiation signal. >>go to rainbofilm extension page
X-film
After improving the behavior of rainbofilm, we think about more innovative ideas about biofilm. If we could rewire and even fine-tune the input and output, this stratified expression system will act as a machine that receives different inputs and make different responses just like single-input module .Thus we could produce a incredibly robust and engineerable biofilm, X-film. We then developed X-film into three subprojects:
Sugarfilm: Using biofilm to produce fuel.

Sensorfilm: Using biofilm as a more quantitative and robust biosensor with higher tolerance.
>>go to Sensorfilm page
Gluefilm: Using biofilm as two-sided tapes that become sticky only after two fitted surface are put together.

Biofilm formation
Quorum sensing plays an important role in biofilm formation. In many Gram-negative bacteria, quorum-sensing systems respond to N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), which were proved to be essential for the architecture of biofilm. Thus we co-transformed our device along with BBa_K091191, a device capable of sending out AI-2 molecules under the control of a pBAD promoter that can be induced with arabinose.

Project
Rainbofilm is a stratified expression system in biofilm, a self-organized module extensible for various needs. Researchers found a vertical oxygen gradient establishes in the biofilm. Such property allows us to use oxygen sensitive promoters to artificially induce differentiated functions through the spatial distribution of cells. Thus, the multi-step reaction can be processed within the different layers of the biofilm.
The biofilm and its layered structure form spontaneously. Also biofilm has the natural resistance to high levels of toxin. These two properties render the Rainbofilm a convenient stable system for bio-production and bio-sensor. The system can cater to different needs simply by changing downstream genes. One possible application is ethanol production. The cellulose is degraded to monose from the bottom to the middle layer, and the ethanol is produced and secreted in the surface to minimize the toxicity to the inner cells.

Achievements
We've successfully completed:
▪ Improving an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
▪ Helping another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
▪ We've taken a special effort in modeling to make it comprehensive and helpful for each module of our project
▪ We've clearly detailed our approaches to possible biosafety issues related with our project, and answered the safety questions.

Team
We are a young and happy team of 13 scientists and   engineers from very diverse backgrounds.Although this is our first year   working on a wet lab project and biofilm experiments are new to us,   we're currently taking great efforts to build the whole system for   experiments.Our team progress and more info will be frequently updated   so that our iGEM experience could be shared as much as possible along   the way. We truly welcome you to contact us for any cooperation or   suggestion.
