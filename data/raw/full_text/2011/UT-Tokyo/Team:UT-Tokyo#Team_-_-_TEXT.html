About Us
The 2011 iGEM UT-Tokyo team is composed of 19 undergraduates from freshman to senior, from a wide range of courses : medicine, pharmacy, chemistry, biology, physics, and so on. This diversity of backgrounds enables us to make our team work fluently. Each member gives full play to his/her ability.

The kanji form of my name is "貴人", and we can also read this kanji as "kijin". The Homonym of "貴人" as "kijin" is "奇人", and this letters mean "the eccentric" ! So, the fact that I am An Eccentric Man is proven. Q.E.D

My goal is to come up with something witty to say here by the wiki freeze.
Scrap that, my new goal is to come up with a way to hack into iGEM to make this possible after the freeze.
