Dual luciferase assay
Preparation
Dual-GloR Luciferase Assay System (Promega)
Transfer the contents of one bottle of Dual-GloR Luciferase Buffer to one bottle of Dual-GloR Luciferase Substrate to make Dual-GloR Luciferase Reagent.
Calculate the amount of Dual-GloR Stop & GloR Reagent needed for the experiment. Using a new container, dilute the Dual-GloR Stop & GloR Substrate 1 : 100 into Dual-GloR Stop & GloR Buffer to make the needed volume of Dual-GloR Stop & GloR Reagent.
PBS
Luminescence vial
Protocol
Centrifuge the incubative tube at 3,000g for 15 min with soft brake.
Decant supernatant, wash with 1mL PBS
Centrifuge at 3,000g for 5 min with soft brake.
Decant supernatant, add 100 ul cell lysis buffer.
Remove lysate 10-50 ul to the vial.
Add a volume of Dual-GloR Reagent equal to the volume of cell lysate.
Wait at least 5 minutes to allow for chemiluminescence to become stable, then measure the firefly luminescence in a uminometer.
Add a volume of Dual-GloR Stop & GloR Reagent equal to the original culture medium volume.
Wait at least 5 minutes, then measure Renilla luminescence
Calculate the ratio of luminescence from the experimental reporter to luminescence from the control reporter.

pour contents out of the incubative tube into the 1.5mL tube as you can
centrifuge for 10min (15,000rpm)
(you can centrifuge incubative tube directly when it can endure up to 6,000g )
throw supernatant fluid away not to damage the precipitation
( you should decant by using yellow tip first / remove culture medium as you can / throw waste water away in bio hazard!)
add 250μl cell resuspension solution (red label)、suspend completely
(incomplete suspending decreases yields / you should use epp stand like a washboard)
add 250μl Cell lysis solution（green label）
turn the tube upside down four times slowly not to bubble
add 10μl Alkalin Protease Sol. （small bottle）
turn the tube upside down four times slowly not to bubble
wait for 5min （Be careful not to exceed 5min! colon bacillus will disintegrate too much!）
add 350μl Neutralization Sol. (blue label）
turn the tube upside down four times slowly not to bubble
centrifuge for 10min (15,000rpm)
put the supernatant fluid to column (germ’s wreckage is adhering below)
centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm)
throw flow through (the liquid in the tube below) away
add 750μl Wash Sol. to column and centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm)
throw flow through away, put 250μL Wash Sol. to column and centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm)
change the column into 1.5ml tube and centrifuge for 2min (15,000rpm)
change the tube into new one and add 50μL MilliQ
(use Nucleas-Free Water in the kit instead of MilliQ)
centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm) after waiting for 1min
take 1 to 1.5μL and determine the concentration by NanoDrop (Don’t dilute)

Ethanol precipitation for Parts shipping
Preparation
100%, 70% Ethanol
TE buffer
Miniprep products
Procedure
Add 2 volumes ice cold absolute ethanol to sample.
Incubate 1 hr at -80°C.
(The long incubation time is critical for small fragments)
Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 0°C at maximum speed (generally >10000 g at least).
Remove supernatant.
Wash with 750-1000 ul room-temperature 95% ethanol.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4°C at maximum speed (generally >10000 g at least).
Dry the pellet. For this you can air dry (tubes open, ~15 min).
(Overdrying can make DNA hard to re-dissolve)
Add 10 ul TE buffer. Vortex and spin down to resuspend.
Determine the concentration by NanoDrop.
Notes
Pellets can be very small and hard to see. Make sure that you don't break invisible pellets on all steps.
