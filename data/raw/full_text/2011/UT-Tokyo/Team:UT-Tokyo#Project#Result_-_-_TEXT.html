This page is composed of the results of our experiments.
The experiments are to evaluate the possibility and potential of our idea and can be divided into two sections: chemoattraction and production of L-Asp, and motility regulation by CheZ. Each page of the two sections includes the goal and methodological outline of experiments carried out as well as the results.
In addition, we deviced “dual luciferase assay kit” in order to establish better measurement of gene expression. This kit is designed so that luciferase assay can easily be conducted for iGEM-standardized promoters. Explanation and analysis of this kit is given here.
Details of methods and experimental conditions for each experiment are provided in Method page
