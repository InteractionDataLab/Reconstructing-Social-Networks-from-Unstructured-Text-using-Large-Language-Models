The Future as we see it
Here are two interesting ideas on how plasmid DNA technology can be applied, not just for DNA vaccines.
Achieving synergy with TCM in conditioning the body’s immune system – The practice of traditional Chinese medicine uses a holistic approach in evaluation and treatment. TCM practice puts a strong emphasis on the integrity of the human body and its relationship to the environment. The goal of treatment is to restore balance and flow of energy (‘Qi’). TCM therapeutic approaches include acupuncture, acupressure, massage, herbal medicine, Tai Chi and Qi Gong, and cultivating healthy lifestyles and practices. pDNA technology can come in useful in complimenting health management, addressing issues at a micro/cellular level. It can be used to influence fluids and metabolism and modulate immune activation.
Quitting drug addiction through genetic therapy – pDNA is already used as a method of non-viral transfection in gene therapy. Its transfection efficiency can be improved using the E. coili manufacturing toolkit, electroporation, sonoporation or gene gun. If we are able to achieve behaviourial programming through gene therapy, there is no more need for a drug substitute and having to go through cold turkey. This is of course controversial and in order for it to proceed, first we need to put in place a comprehensive legal framework.
