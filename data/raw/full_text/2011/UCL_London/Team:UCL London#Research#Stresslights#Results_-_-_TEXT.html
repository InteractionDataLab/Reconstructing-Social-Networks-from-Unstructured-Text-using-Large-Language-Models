Gel photo after digestion of individual parts
The yellow and green highlighted bands indicate the YFP.LVA and the mNark promoter respectively. However the band for RBS and Terminator is probably absent due to both the small amount of DNA and their minute size. But the DNA sequence can still be confirmed by their relevant backbones: pSB1A2 for RBS and pSB1AK3 for terminator.

The presence of quite a large number of colonies indicate the success of the 3A assembly of the final device.
