Are our new BioBricks safe?
The BioBrick parts we are going to make this year are related to DNA gyrase, gyrase binding site. DNA gyrase is an essential bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling of double-stranded, closed-circular DNA [2] . Gyrase binding site facilitates supercoiling of specific plasmids. To date there is no research showing that DNA gyrase and its binding site could be toxic or harmful, therefore, it has little or no potential risk to human health or the environment.
