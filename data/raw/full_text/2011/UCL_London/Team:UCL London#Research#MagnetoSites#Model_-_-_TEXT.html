Model
The spinning model here is the dimerized Gyr A subunits which binds to a DNA double helix at the interphase between the interaction of Gyr A and Gyr B subunits. The two subunits are coloured in blue and purple respectively with the molecular surface of the structure visualized at 60% transparency.
The protein model was made by using UCSF Chimera software together with Jmol (protein model visualisation software).
