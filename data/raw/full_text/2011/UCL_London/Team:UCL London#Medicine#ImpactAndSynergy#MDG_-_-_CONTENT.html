This multi-tier savings approach comes at an opportune time when the global economy is still reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis and now heading for a “double dip” recession. The only way to still maintain a high standard of healthcare provision when governments are implementing austerity measures and charity funds are drying up is to come up with a cheap, yet efficacious drug. DNA vaccines are therefore the way forward.
</P><P>Our world is facing increasingly common medical challenges, like aging demographics, burgeoning obesity and more significantly, the systemic rise of global infectious diseases. DNA vaccine is the only platform that can promptly tackle such issues on a global context since production is just 2-3 weeks compared to 6 months for conventional vaccines.
</P><P>With a cheap and effective DNA vaccine we can consider taking this from national healthcare to global healthcare; as DNA vaccines are very pro poor and cost effective, it can facilitate the implementation of the Millenium Development Goals set by the WHO:
</P><P>Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger: DNA vaccines will immunise people effectively and keep them healthy and less susceptible to diseases. As always, prevention is always better than treatment. This form of aid will instigate a virtuous cycle where having a greater life span and better health equals more productivity, being more productive will generate more income, more money means making ends meet, such as meeting basic essentials such as food, clean water and shelter. This is key step towards escaping poverty.
</P><P>Promote gender equality and empower women: This carries on from point one, if impoverished parents start making more money, they are most likely to spend any remaining monies and start investing in their childrens’ education as this is the only way out of poverty. Through education, gender equality will be taught and nurtured. Women who benefit from education are already on their way to empowerment. 
</P><P>Reduce child mortality rates: This can be achieved by immunising mothers from diseases which may cross the placenta barrier, for example rubella, Varicella zoster, mumps and HIV.
</P><P>Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases: DNA vaccines show promise as a platform for scientists and doctors to collaborate and drive translational research to develop cures and ensure rapid deployment.
</P><P>Ensure environmental stability: Our project reduces the environmental impact in biopharmaceutical manufacture. For instance, the strive for economies of scale and cost saving also reduces energy consumption, raw material input and autolysis spares the need to use very toxic chemicals for extraction.
</P><P>Develop a global partnership for development: Again, we’d like to reiterate that DNA vaccine is a platform technology that requires multidisciplinary research and joint effort in a global context. There are many infectious diseases for which there isn’t a satisfactory vaccine yet such as Hepatitis C, malaria and HIV.
</P><P>Once the industrialisation and marketing of DNA vaccines has taken off, Project E. coili has other contributions to add to global health, vaccine economics, and security too. Our manufacturing toolkit tackles cost issues, process standardisation, capacity and quality control. Big Pharma can take this concept for upscaling and implement it to ensure the uninterrupted supply of affordable vaccines, which is now a major strategic requirement for successful immunization. There is an incentive to adopt E. coili as it achieves the 2P’s in “two birds with one stone” fashion – philanthropy and profit. Some day we could get daily vaccines using a gene gun, analogous to updating a computer antivirus database every day. This could be a viable way to always be within one step, either mostly ahead or occasionally just barely behind, in the evolutionary arms race.
