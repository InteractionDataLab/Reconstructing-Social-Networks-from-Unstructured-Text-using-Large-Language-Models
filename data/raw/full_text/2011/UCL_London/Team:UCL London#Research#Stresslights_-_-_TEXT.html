The Concept of Stresslight 2.0
The development of a bioprocessing operation for the production of a useful product on a commercial scale involves extensive optimisation procedure in order to maximise the yield and quality of the product. The idea of Stresslight 2.0 has been extended from the UCL iGEM 2009 project in order to develop a toolkit with a collection of useful and precise sensory devices for the industry with different fluorescence colours indicating different kinds of stress. The basic approach is to identify particular promoter sequences, which can detect a particular stress or stimuli relevant to the bioprocess and ligate it to a fluorescent protein expression cassette, in order to monitor that particular stress in real-time throughout the fermentation process in a quick, efficient and simple way. The major modification this year was the addition of a LVA tag for faster degradation of the fluorescent proteins in order to reduce their half life and increase the accuracy and sensitivity of the stress measurements.
