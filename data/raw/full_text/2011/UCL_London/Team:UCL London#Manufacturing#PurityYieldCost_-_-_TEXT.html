Introduction
As discussed in the medical session, DNA vaccine technology has created the potential for a broad variety of human diseases including cancer. The development of DNA vaccines has entered into human clinical trials stage. In order to study the impact of our project, E.coili, on DNA vaccine industry, we have done a case study based on DNA vaccine for certain types of cancer. The results clearly show the improvement in terms of yield, purity, processing time and cost by using cell as a factory with the application of synthetic biology.
