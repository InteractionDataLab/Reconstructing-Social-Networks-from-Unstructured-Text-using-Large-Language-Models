Manufacturing
One of our project’s aims is to improve the current plasmid DNA manufacturing in terms of cost, yield, purity and processing time by using synthetic biology to construct novel bacterial host strain.
The flowchart on top is a simplified elaboration of industrial plasmid DNA vaccine manufacturing process. By moving the mouse over the ‘E.coili cell’, the highlighted parts will give you an idea on how our subprojects fit into the industrial bioprocess. Supercoiliology, Magneto.sites and Monitoring tools will be used in fermentation stage with the aim to increase product yield and quality. Extractery will have more impact on the cell lysis stage to help removing the current bottleneck in industry. The four modules integrated and collaborated, more details will be shown in each section.
