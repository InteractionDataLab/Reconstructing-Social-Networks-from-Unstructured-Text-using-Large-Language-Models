Team Alberta recognizes the important role that safety plays in the
completion of any scientific undertaking. Our team members are fully
committed to not only ensuring the safety of those within our lab but
also addressing any potential risks that our project may pose to the
greater community.



Please find below Team Alberta's answers to the new, required iGEM
safety questions.

<H3 id="Section_1">1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final
product pose:</H3><H4>a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in
the lab?</H4><DIV class="safety-img" id="labelledflask">
Neurospora is stored in clearly labelled flasks with sponge tops to prevent contamination
</DIV><P>The materials used in our project pose little to no risks to the
safety and health of our team members or others in the lab and our
final product poses no risk to these individuals.</P><P>The organism that our group has genetically manipulated,
<I>Neurospora crassa</I>, is well-documented as being safe<SUP>1</SUP>. N. crassa is
a biosafety level 1 organism. Since 1941 the species has been used
extensively in laboratories resulting in the publication of thousands
of research papers. In none of these numerous publications has the
<I>Neurospora</I> genus been implicated in causing disease in either animals
or plants<SUP>1-4</SUP>.</P><P><I>Neurospora's</I> minimal threat can largely be attributed to it being
an obligate aerobe. Unlike other species such as yeasts, <I>Neurospora</I>
is unable to grow in organs such as the gut or bladder, tissues, or
systemically within an organism<SUP>1</SUP>. Furthermore, despite <I>Neurospora</I>
being regarded by some as an allergen, medical literature generally
fails to mention the genus<SUP>5-8</SUP>.</P><P>Our team acknowledges that though certain fungal species
themselves may not be pathogenic, they may produce dangerous
toxins. Throughout our research into Neurospora our group has
not found any documentation of the species producing dangerous
mycotoxins or any dangerous secondary metabolites<SUP>1</SUP>. Given that
Neurospora has had such a long history of living in close association
with humans (please see below), it is a generally regarded as being
harmless.</P><DIV class="safety-img" id="waste">
Clearly labelled waste disposal containers ensure proper removal of potentially hazardous materials
</DIV><P>It should be noted that there are still materials used in our
project that may potentially be hazardous. Our esterification procedure
involves the use of strong chemicals and reagents, some of which have
the potential to cause harm. These reagents are primarily volatile and
require careful handling and storage.</P><P>As well, Hygromycin b, an antibiotic and antifungal agent that
is used for selection, is toxic if inhaled. Care must be taken around
powdered or lyophilized Hygromycin B, and precaution should be taken
to cover up respiratory passageways, skin, and the eyes. However,
Hygromycin B is most commonly purchased in liquid form, and in liquid
carries with it significantly less potential for accidental inhalation.</P><H4>b. Risks to the safety and health of the general public if
released by design or accident?</H4><P>Our organism poses no threat to the safety and health of the
general public. Neurospora has a well-documented history of living in
close association with humans. It has historically resided in a variety of
businesses including bakeries, lumber yards and plywood factories<SUP>1;9-
11</SUP>. Growth has also been observed on the stubble of burnt sugar cane
fields and along burnt railway tracks<SUP>13</SUP>. Thus, it poses no threat to the
health and safety of those in its surroundings.</P><H4>c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or
accident?</H4><P>As mentioned, N. crassa has a long history of living in close
association with humans; however, these instances are largely
documented as having occurred in moist tropical or subtropical
environments. Like many fungi, warm and moist is the favored climate
for Neurospora growth<SUP>1</SUP>. Thus, if our organism, WT or manipulated,
were to be released in our dry, temperate environment of Edmonton,
Alberta, Canada, with its bitterly harsh winters, we would expect its
survival and environmental impact to be minimal. Even if it were to
survive, we cannot see it affecting local ecosystems by any appreciable
amount.</P><P>Nonetheless, our alternative biodiesel has the potential to
revolutionize economies throughout the world, as discussed in our
human practices component, and we must therefore regard the effects
of environmental exposure to Neurospora in other climates. Were
Neurospora to be released in other warmer climates it may readily
survive, creating its own niche within the environment. However, the
aforementioned nonpathogenicity of the genus results in this not being
a source of alarm<SUP>1-4</SUP>.</P><P>Further, Team Alberta predicts that our manipulated strain
of Neurospora crassa would be disadvantaged to survive relative
to WT in any environment; our genetic manipulation results in the
organism's energy being diverted away from essential metabolic
functions, inhibiting organismal growth and manipulation. This puts it
at a disadvantage against natural competing fungi.</P><H4>d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals,
groups or states?</H4><P>Unforeseen alteration of biopart functions may represent issues
of concern. However, in our case if one or several of our bioparts were
changed to alter their function or stop working as intended, limited to
no safety issues would arise. Our knockout of the FadD gene results
in there being limited potential for its alteration of function. Further,
our manipulation of thioesterases similarly represents limited safety
concerns due to their prevalence in all organisms. If further alterations
were to be made to thioesterase genes and resulted in overproduction,
our organism would likely die or have a limited existence; if further
alterations to thioesterase genes were to prevent their function, then
the organism may return to a more WT phenotype<SUP>12</SUP>.</P><P>The misuse of our bioconverter represents a potential threat
to safety. The esterification process requires heat and flammable
chemicals contained within a sealed vessel and thus the potential for
serious injury exists.</P><H3 id="Section_2">2. If your response to any of the questions above is yes:</H3><H4>a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design
and while conducting laboratory work.</H4><P>To deal with such issues our team greatly scrutinized all
steps within our procedure for potential hazards and subsequently
collectively addressed all areas of concern. Please see the outline
below.</P><P>Our careful consideration of the potential safety concerns
associated with the completion of our project and our careful
documentation and safety training have allowed us to work both
responsibly and cautiously, limiting the probability of injuries.</P><P>All MSDS data sheets were followed in working with strong acids,
bases, volatile chemicals, or otherwise potentially harmful reagents. All
antibiotics and antifungals were stored cold and in sealed containers,
and any reacting chemicals were kept in separate storage areas. All
experiments done involving the use of open flame, electrical power
sources, or flammable substances were treated with the utmost
caution. All experiments with distillation used properly fitted apparatus
and were designed to eliminate all possibility of heating closed
containers. (For details on the safe handling of Hygromycin b, please
see question 3).</P><P>Safety issues arising from the completion of our bioreactor were
addressed in the stages of its design. Several important safeguards
were incorporated. For example, our bioconverter is designed to
automatically turn off upon exceeding the recommended temperature
and pressure past specific margins.</P><H4>b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or
environmental issues as you submit your parts to the Registry.</H4><P>In submitting parts to the registry, Team Alberta has actively
undertaken the practice of describing and documenting any safety,
security, health and/or environmental issues of our parts as they are
submitted to the registry. None of our parts confer any pathogenicity
or otherwise harmful effects upon either Neurospora crassa or
Escherichia coli.</P><P>One of our parts will confer Hygromycin B resistance to
Neurospora crassa, and such strains that contain this part should be
noted as being resistant to that particular antifungal agent.</P><H3 id="Section_3">3. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?</H3><H4>a. Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so
what are they? Provide a link to them online if possible.</H4><P>Yes, the University of Alberta contains a specified set of
Biosafety Rules that are outlined within the Biosafety Manual that is
published by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety. A link to
his valuable resource can be found here:
<A href="http://www.ehs.ualberta.ca/en/EHSDivisions/~/media/8C72A3F626FB47B6BD70EC79C94CD1CE.ashx">
http://www.ehs.ualberta.ca/en/EHSDivisions/~/media/8C72A3F626FB47B6BD70EC79C94CD1CE.ashx</A></P><H4>b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety
Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed
your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes
that were made based on this review.</H4><P>Team Alberta consulted the University of Alberta's Office of
Environmental Health and Safety throughout the planning of our
project. The Biosafety Division of this office provides both technical
expertise and support to labs throughout campus and thus ensures
a safe working and learning environment for both staff and students.
In addition, the division also monitors compliance with federal and
provincial legislation<SUP>16</SUP>.</P><P>Our team submitted a written overview of the relevant safety
considerations associated with our project to this office. Upon
perusal of this document, the Biosafety Officer provided us with
recommendations to fully ensure that our project met all biosafety
requirements. Please see the Biosafety Officer's recommendations
below and how we met each of them:</P><OL style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><LI><P>It was recommended that if our lab were to grow N. Crassa beyond
a 10L culture volume that we would have to obtain permission from
the federal government, as such a culture would be considered large
scale production. The Biosafety Officer therefore recommends avoiding
production of cultures beyond a 9.5L volume. In addition, it was
recommended that our lab prepare a Biological Spill Remediation kit
according to the Standard Operating Protocols (SOP) of the university.</P><P>To avoid having to proceed with a lengthy governmental registration
process in the relatively short timeframe of the iGEM competition, our
lab will ensure that no culture we prepare will be larger than 9.5L.
To date, the largest culture that we have prepared has been less
than 1.5L. As well, the members of our lab assembled the materials
required for a Biological Spill Remediation kit, which will allow for the
safe and efficient cleanup of any potential spills.</P></LI><LI><P>The Biosafety officer recommended that our lab ensure all cultures
of N. crassa be rendered inert prior to disposal.</P><P>The members of our lab have already been adhering to this practice
by treating all cultures of N. crassa with a household bleach mixture
for a minimum of one hour prior to disposal. Our bleach mixture
contains a minimum of one part bleach to three parts culture, which is
consistent with the guidelines outlined by the Biosafety Division of the
Environmental Health and Safety Office.</P></LI><LI><P>The Biosafety Officer recommended that all individuals working
within our lab should wear personal protective equipment (PPE),
comprised of fully-fastened laboratory coats or gowns, disposable
gloves, safety glasses, closed-toe shoes and floor-length pants.</P><P>The members of our lab have been adhering to this common
laboratory practice since the very beginning.</P></LI><LI><P>Due to the use of the antibiotic and antifungal Hygromycin b, the
Biosafety Officer recommended that all work with this antibiotic be
carried out in a fume hood. He further recommended that members
of our team coming in contact with this antibiotic be fit-tested for N95
respirators in the event that this antibiotic cannot be handled within
the fume hood.</P><P>The members of our team who are not fit-tested for N95 respirators
will not work with Hygromycin b. The two members of our team that
will work with this antibiotic have been fit-tested with N95 respirators
so that they may safely handle this compound, regardless of its form.
All work with Hygromycin b will be carried out within a fumehood.</P></LI></OL><H4>c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training
before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.</H4><DIV class="safety-img" id="manual">
Information about reagents and safety protocols are all found in an easily accessible binder
</DIV><P>The members of our lab have all had variable levels of laboratory
experience upon beginning the summer. Though most members
had some level of biosafety training from previous lab experiences,
including WHMIS certification, some members did not have any
previous safety training. Because of this uneven experience, all
members of our team received a laboratory tour at the beginning of
the project. This included an overview of general laboratory safety
procedures and protocols. Additionally, all team members were briefed
on new safety procedures as our project developed. For example, upon
beginning work with our organism, N. crassa, all lab members were
briefed on its safe disposal.</P><H4>d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or
guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if possible.</H4><P>Yes, the Public Health Agency of Canada outlines national
biosafety guidelines. Specifically, the Laboratory Biosafety and
Biosecurity Division of this agency is responsible for publishing
biosafety regulations. A quick synopsis of these guidelines may be
found here:

<A href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/regul/index-eng.php">http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/regul/index-eng.php</A></P><H3 id="Section_4">4.Optional Question: Do you have other ideas on how to deal
with safety or security issues that could be useful for future
iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be
made even safer through biosafety engineering?</H3><P>In order to motivate future iGEM teams to further emphasize
safety in their daily laboratory practices, we propose that each team
completes a detailed safety report for a minimal medal requirement.
Bearing in mind the increasing importance of safety in the rapidly
expanding synthetic biology field, Team Alberta further proposes that
future iGEM competitions require teams to engineer their parts and
organisms with several safeguards in place in order to achieve a gold
medal. If these components were medal requirements, we feel that it
would greatly motivate iGEM participants to address potential safety
issues, and not just obvious ones, far ahead of time. This attention
towards possible problems, and the solutions around them, will pay
immense rewards in their future work, iGEM or otherwise. Moreover,
this would encourage teams to be more creative with respects to
synthetic biology and genetic engineering.</P><P>Our team recognizes that biosafety engineering has the potential
to make many devices and systems safer. For example, essential
gene knockouts can be created through partial or full amino acid
deletions instead of single nucleotide alterations that are susceptible
to mutation. Auxotrophic (or nutrient-deficient) strains can be created
to ensure that an organism has no chance to exist outside of the
laboratory environment, ensuring a minimal chance of contaminating
the outside world. Organisms can even be designed to positively
or negatively respond to varying wavelengths of light and electrical
stimuli. All this and more should be taken into account when designing
any organic circuit.</P><H3 id="References">References</H3><OL><LI>
