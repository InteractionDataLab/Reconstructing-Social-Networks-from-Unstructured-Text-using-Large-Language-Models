The Plan
How do you get fuel from waste?  Learn about Team Alberta's progression from by-product                             biomass to a viable biodiesel.

The Procedure
New organisms require new                             techniques. Learn how Team Alberta                             progressed from an idea to a reality                             and the steps required to get there.

The Product
Biodiesel is a viable fuel. See our                             fuel in action and learn about Team Alberta's plans to make biodiesel                             production and usage even easier.

The Potential
Home production and commercial production are                             viable options for our biodiesel production                              methods. See Team Alberta's plan to make a                              small laboratory process into small scale                             bio-production and large scale.

WELCOME
Team Alberta's aim is to aid in the solution of a global problem, the fuel crisis, by thinking locally. In Alberta, our main industrial practices lay within the oil and gas sector; however, we also have a thriving agricultural and forestry-based industry. The industrial processes associated with these industries produce biomass by-products of little economic value. The aim of our project is to convert these by-products into a useful and economically viable fuel, biodiesel.
Previous research has been largely focused on engineering organisms to metabolize cellulose, a highly inefficient approach with very little yield. Here is where our approach differs. Why engineer a new organism to perform a function nature has perfected in another species? Why not just make this organism even better?
We have selected the filamentous, ascomycete fungus Neurospora     crassa, which is a natural cellulose metabolizer, with the aim of creating an organism to efficiently make biodiesel. Our fuel will be made by up-regulating fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting beta-oxidation, effectively causing the over-production of fatty acids within N. crassa. From here we will efficiently esterify the fatty acids into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), producing a viable fuel.

About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
