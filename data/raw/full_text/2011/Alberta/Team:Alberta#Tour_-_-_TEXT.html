Project MycoDiesel
Our team began our project in early May, just after                 exams ended. The project concept was greatly deliberated but         after many weeks of research and heated conversation we         decided on making a biofuel from common cellulose waste         products. In order to optimally use the summer, we spilt         our project into four main components: growth , genetics , esterification , and human practices . As always we wanted         to keep safety as a frontrunner in our project.
Why use waste? In Alberta, we have three main industries,         Petroleum, Agriculture and Forestry. The agricultural         and forestry sectors produce lots of by-product biomass         that is mostly unused and of relatively little economic         value. We wanted to be able to use the biomass created to         make an economically viable, efficient biofuel. Our idea         also centralized on the highly controversial food versus             fuel debate , which has emerged with the common practice of         using food sources, such as corn or sugar cane, to produce         biofuel.
But what organisms are capable of using cellulosic                 biomass? We originally thought of engineering                 an organism to produce cellulases but after much                 research, realized that cellulose degradation was                 much more complicated than originally perceived. We                 decided to use an organism that nature had already                 optimized to degrade cellulose. We selected the                 filamentous fungus, Neurospora crassa , known in                 nature for appearing after forest fires to help                 with secondary succession. The task of determining                 growth substrates and optimizing growth conditions                 was given to team growth .
How to produce a biofuel? We brainstormed                 many ways in which biofuel could be created in an                 organism and decided to modify fatty acid metabolism.                 Our plan was to up-regulate fatty acid synthesis and                 down-regulate beta oxidation (fatty acid breakdown).                 We hoped that this would cause an excess of fatty                     acids to be produced in the organism, which can                 be esterified to produce a biodiesel .  The task of                 making this work was given to team genetics .
We wanted to make the conversion of fatty acids into a biodiesel as efficient as possible. Team esterification dedicated many hours running test trials and working on perfecting their methodology .
We wanted the creation of our biodiesel to be                 simple and to eventually be able to be done on                 both a household and industrial scale. We created                 a design of a possible bioreactor and explored the                 implications our biodiesel would have on economies                 and the cost of commonly found goods. A detailed case study can be found in our human practices section as well as a variety of outreach programs                 we conducted with students from the Edmonton area                 and numerous elected government officials.
In previous years, Team Alberta developed a                 very efficient method of assembly under the name Genomikon . Using this fast, affordable, and simple                 assembly method we were able to produce 7 parts to add                 to the registry for use in Neurospora crassa . We                 also learned a variety of new protocols for use                 in Neurospora crassa and even made a few of our                 own. Our progress and the use of numerous protocols,                 and parts can be seen in our notebook .
Feel free to check out our achievements and a really cool video , showing our biodiesel in action. We also                 used a variety of social media to update the public                 on our progress and report our successes. Without the help of many people, our project would                 not be possible. Check out the list of our advisors ,                 who helped us achieve our goals, and the list of our sponsors , who truly made our project possible.
