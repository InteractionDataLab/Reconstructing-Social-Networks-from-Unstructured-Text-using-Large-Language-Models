Cost Analysis
While MycoDiesel resolves the ethical issue of food         crop usage as inputs for biodiesel production, Team Alberta         wanted to further emphasize the benefits of our project's         approach. As the inputs to our production process are largely         industrial wastes, MycoDiesel also promises to provide         substantial cost advantages, savings that can potentially         be passed on to consumers. Given the current economic         hardships throughout the majority of the developed world,         MycoDiesel's approach is an attractive potential solution         to attenuate ever-increasing consumer fuel prices.
Team Alberta received the help of Alex Siu, an accounting         student at the University of Alberta School of Business, who conducted a preliminary cost analysis study to explore         the potential savings that can be realized from synthesizing         biodiesel using MycoDiesel's approach.
Preliminary Cost Analysis
Given that our laboratory production process remains         in its infancy and is not ready for commercial analysis,         to achieve the most reliable cost information, the         large-scale production of soybean biodiesel was used as         a model for our estimates. Within our analysis, the net         cost of relevant direct materials was estimated to be zero,         given that they are industrial byproducts that are readily         disposed of throughout industries. According to You et         al. (2008), the direct material input of soybean biodiesel         production represented 64.8% - 75.9% of the total cost of         production1. Keeping with the most conservative estimate,         i.e. one that posses the highest non-direct material         cost, our analysis will estimate that 64.8% of total         cost of production is attributable to current B100 pump         prices. However, it should be noted that with the relatively         recent trend in rising food prices, raw material input prices         may actually present a large share of production costs. The         following tables estimate the cost breakdown of 2011 B100         fuel prices within the United States, the estimated retail         and production costs of our fuel, and the estimated retail         cost of our fuel relative to other similar fuels.

When the estimated cost of biodiesel made by our         production process is compared to tradition fuels,         a significant decrease in price is observed. With the         exception of E85, which is not considered to have the same         efficiency, a 32% price reduction is seen.
The method of analysis used was to estimate the reduction         in the total cost by separating current fuel prices into         separate cost components that make up the current market         price.
*The market for biodiesel in Canada, in contrast to the         United States, is still very much in its infancy. Therefore,         the costs of biodiesel production and retail costs are not         readily available if at all in some provinces.
The Impact on the Average American Family and Canadian Family
The impact of biodiesel on food prices throughout the         world remains controversial. The most popular opinion         on this issue appears to be that there is a direct         correlation between the use of food crops as inputs in         biodiesel production processes and an increase in food         prices. The biofuel industry, however, refutes this claim,         citing multiple reasons of why biofuel production is not         the primary reason for this observed increase in price. As         our approach to biodiesel production do not make use of any         essential food crop, our analysis is able to avoid this         controversy. Nonetheless, without conclusive evidence on         the impact of biofuels (and its future replacement with         our biodiesel) on world food prices, our analysis used the         most conservative estimate and assumed that there will be         an insignificant impact on the average American family's         and Canadian family's food prices.
While generally neither American families nor Canadian families own and operate diesel-powered vehicles, certain         diesel-powered vehicles are becoming more popular within         these markets. Given current economic hardships, filling         up at the pump is often a significant burden on today's         families and thus we wanted to illustrate how consumers         could save on each tank if they were driving in Toronto, New         York and Los Angeles. The table below represents the cost         breakdown and estimated local price of our fuel relative         that to the local cost of diesel. Estimates were also made         for the local price of an 80% diesel 20% biodiesel mixture,         which represents the current largest biodiesel substitution         feasible in current infrastructure.

From this table we can see that even after adding sales         tax to our fuel, it represents a significant cost savings         to consumers in both direct and 20% substitution.
To further exemplify the cost savings associated with         our alternative biodiesel usage, we compared the estimated         fill up cost of a 55L Diesel Engine Volkswagen Jetta and         a 60L Diesel Engine Chevy Cruise. These models are two of         the most common diesel powered vehicles on American and         Canadian roads.

The Potential
While use of diesel-powered vehicles is relatively         uncommon in North America, use of such vehicles in Europe is         incredibly popular. To emphasize the impact of such a trend         reaching North America and the potential savings to families,         we decided to end this cost analysis with data on current         gasoline expenditures. While reading these data, keep in mind         that our production processes represented a savings of 32%         and that similar savings could be observed should similar         advances be made in gasoline production processes.
The American Family
According to the 2009 American Consumer Expenditure         Survey, the average family with dependents has an average         annual expenditure $68,841 USD or $72494.24 USD after         adjusting for inflation.xi Of these expenditures,         gasoline accounts for $2,868 USD or $3020.20 USD after         adjusting for inflationi. (Inflation is based on a rate of         5.3%.)
If the price of fuel could be reduced by a similar 32%,         the average American family with dependants could save         $996.46 USD per year. This reflects upon direct savings         seen at the gas service station.
Moreover, further potential savings could be incurred         resulting from reduced transportation costs of various         household goods.
The American Individual
Similarly, the average American individual with no         spouse and no dependents spent an average of $1,360 USD on         gasoline in 2009. After adjusting the figures for inflation,         in 2011 the amount spent on fuel would approximately be         $1432 USD. Taking the savings of 32% we could reduce those         expenditures by $458 USD.
The Canadian Family
According to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian         household will spend 3.8% of their income on motor vehicle         fuel.xii The average Canadian family with         two children and two working adults earned $85,600 CDN         in 2009 according to Statistics Canada. After adjusting         for inflation that would be approximately 90,000 CDN in         2011.xiii Given the 3.8% expenditure on motor         vehicle fuel and applying this to the adjusted income         yields $3420 CDN, an estimate on the total amount of money         spent on gasoline and fuel products for a typical Canadian         family. Again, this value could be reduced by 32%, yielding         $1094 CDN in annual cost savings.
Conclusion
If our product can successfully scale into commercial         production it holds much potential to change the future of         energy in countries. Our estimates clearly show the potential         economic viability of such an alternative fuel. Therefore,         not only environmentally, but also economically as seen         here, there is significant reason to further investigate         our approaches as a means for providing lower
