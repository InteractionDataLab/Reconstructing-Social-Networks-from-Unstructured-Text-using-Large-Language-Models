Governmental Involvement
MycoDiesel has the potential to revolutionize economies         throughout the world. However, advances such as ours         require governmental support to not only further their         development but also to ensure their incorporation into         communities.
While iGEM teams have historically focused on public         awareness, most notably at the high school level,         Team Alberta felt that given the scope of our project,         governmental outreach was also of fundamental importance to our         human practices initiatives.
Throughout the summer, Team Alberta made a substantial effort to gain the         attention of several individuals holding governmental         office. Resultantly, our team was successful in gaining         the audience of several prominent governmental officials,         including the Honorable Ron Liepert, Minister of Energy in         the Province of Alberta, the Honorable Stephen Mandel, Mayor         of Edmonton, and Don Iveson, Edmonton City Councilor.         In addition to promoting our project, the iGEM competition         and the field of synthetic biology, these meetings served         as a valuable forum for discussing the energy challenges         that our communities face now and in the future.
Mayor Mandel was able to provide our team with         information about the innovative research that is being         conducted at our city's prominent waste management and         recycling facility. Moreover, he invited our team to test         the working model of our bioreactor at this center's         research facility upon its completion. Councillor Iveson         offered us valuable feedback about our efforts. Most notably,         he suggested that upon the completion of our project, our         team should partner with neighborhood leagues and elementary         and junior high schools to ensure that our bioreactor models         are incorporated feasibly into communities. Furthermore,         the Minister of Energy provided his insights into the         economic challenges that must be regarded when pursuing         biofuel production and he was able to provide us with         several examples of previous alternative energy projects         that the province has undertaken. As well, the minister         valuably brought to our attention that governments must         consider both environmental impact and public opinion when         pursuing energy policy.
We are grateful to these individuals for taking the         time out of their busy schedules to meet with us and for         their valuable insights into the future of energy within         our city and province.
