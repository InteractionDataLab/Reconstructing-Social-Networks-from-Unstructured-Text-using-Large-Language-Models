This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.

May 4
Discussion of iGEM Project and expectations.
Solidifying the genetics, how we plan to accomplish it. Our plan of attack.
May 5
Initial growth experiments, using recipe provided by a friendly lab technician from another lab: Glen. Tried growing N. crassa in diced boiled potato and glucose (+) and (-) medium. Experiment postponed until tomorrow due to broken autoclave.
Determining exact sequence structure of our genes. Ongoing.
May 6
Rethought experimental protocols. First, dice and boil the potatoes. Then, strain the potatoes and either add glucose or leave as is. Autoclave. Stock solutions of N. crassa media.
Growth experiments to determine whether N. crassa requires glucose as a carbon source or can grow on just starch. Let flasks with experiments incubate over the weekend (66 hrs. total)
Ongoing genetic work. Using NCBI Blast technology, ApE (A Plasmid Editor), Geneious, and combing primary lit. to find relevant sequences. Codon-optimizing for N. crassa already completed.
