We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall         fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence         and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever         the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on         the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets,         we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
