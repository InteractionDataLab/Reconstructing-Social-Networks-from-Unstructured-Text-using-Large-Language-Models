Protocols
Wonder how we can make Neurospora power your         car? Check out our protocol page to see how to         grow up your own Neurospora, transform it, or extract         fatty acids and process them through         esterification to produce biodiesel!

Notebook
The road to iGEM is full of challenges. Check out              our lab notebook and track our week-to-week progress              through the summer.

Safety
Are there risks involved working with Neurospora? Are the chemicals and processes              involved in biofuel production hazardous? See how we              have addressed and managed saftey concerns on our              saftey page below.

About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
