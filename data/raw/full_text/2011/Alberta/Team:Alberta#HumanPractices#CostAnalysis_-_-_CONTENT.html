        crop usage as inputs for biodiesel production, Team Alberta
        wanted to further emphasize the benefits of our project's
        approach. As the inputs to our production process are largely
        industrial wastes, MycoDiesel also promises to provide
        substantial cost advantages, savings that can potentially
        be passed on to consumers. Given the current economic
        hardships throughout the majority of the developed world,
        MycoDiesel's approach is an attractive potential solution
        to attenuate ever-increasing consumer fuel prices.</P><P>Team Alberta received the help of Alex Siu, an accounting
        student at the University of Alberta School of Business,
        who conducted a preliminary cost analysis study to explore
        the potential savings that can be realized from synthesizing
        biodiesel using MycoDiesel's approach.</P><H3 id="preliminary">Preliminary Cost Analysis</H3><P>Given that our laboratory production process remains
        in its infancy and is not ready for commercial analysis,
        to achieve the most reliable cost information, the
        large-scale production of soybean biodiesel was used as
        a model for our estimates. Within our analysis, the net
        cost of relevant direct materials was estimated to be zero,
        given that they are industrial byproducts that are readily
        disposed of throughout industries. According to You et
        al. (2008), the direct material input of soybean biodiesel
        production represented 64.8% - 75.9% of the total cost of
        production1. Keeping with the most conservative estimate,
        i.e. one that posses the highest non-direct material
        cost, our analysis will estimate that 64.8% of total
        cost of production is attributable to current B100 pump
        prices. However, it should be noted that with the relatively
        recent trend in rising food prices, raw material input prices
        may actually present a large share of production costs. The
        following tables estimate the cost breakdown of 2011 B100
        fuel prices within the United States, the estimated retail
        and production costs of our fuel, and the estimated retail
        cost of our fuel relative to other similar fuels. </P><CENTER><TABLE class="figure"><TBODY><TR class="top"><TH>Estimation of Cost / US Gallon (USD)</TH><TH>B100/99</TH></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Average price of B100 across the United States<SUP>i</SUP></TH><TD>4.05</TD></TR><TR><TH>Less Excise Taxes (Federal and Provincial)<SUP>ii</SUP></TH><TD>(0.53)</TD></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Add Biofuel Credit</TH><TD>0.50</TD></TR><TR><TH>Less 10% Distribution and Profit (Estimated)</TH><TD>(0.41)</TD></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Total Production Cost</TH><TD>2.61</TD></TR><TR><TH>Cost of Input Direct Material 64.8%</TH><TD>1.69</TD></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Cost of Processing and Labour 36.2%</TH><TD>0.92</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="figure"><TBODY><TR class="top"><TH>Estimated Retail Cost of Our Fuel in USD/gallon</TH><TH>Estimated Production Costs of Our Fuel in USD/gallon</TH></TR><TR class="odd"><TD>2.356128</TD><TD>0.92</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="figure"><TBODY><TR class="top"><TH>Petroleum</TH><TH>Diesel</TH><TH>E85</TH><TH>B20</TH><TH>B100/99</TH><TH>Our Fuel</TH></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Cost US National Average USD/gallon<SUP>iii</SUP></TH><TD>3.08</TD><TD>3.45</TD><TD>2.75</TD><TD>3.50</TD><TD>4.50</TD><TD>2.36</TD></TR><TR><TH>Cost Canada National Average CDN/gallon<SUP>*</SUP></TH><TD>4.54<SUP>iv</SUP></TD><TD>4.47<SUP>v</SUP></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER><P>When the estimated cost of biodiesel made by our
        production process is compared to tradition fuels,
        a significant decrease in price is observed. With the
        exception of E85, which is not considered to have the same
        efficiency, a 32% price reduction is seen. </P><P>The method of analysis used was to estimate the reduction
        in the total cost by separating current fuel prices into
        separate cost components that make up the current market
        price. </P><P><SUP>*</SUP>The market for biodiesel in Canada, in contrast to the
        United States, is still very much in its infancy. Therefore,
        the costs of biodiesel production and retail costs are not
        readily available if at all in some provinces. </P><H3 id="impact">The Impact on the Average American Family and Canadian Family</H3><P>The impact of biodiesel on food prices throughout the
        world remains controversial. The most popular opinion
        on this issue appears to be that there is a direct
        correlation between the use of food crops as inputs in
        biodiesel production processes and an increase in food
        prices. The biofuel industry, however, refutes this claim,
        citing multiple reasons of why biofuel production is not
        the primary reason for this observed increase in price. As
        our approach to biodiesel production do not make use of any
        essential food crop, our analysis is able to avoid this
        controversy. Nonetheless, without conclusive evidence on
        the impact of biofuels (and its future replacement with
        our biodiesel) on world food prices, our analysis used the
        most conservative estimate and assumed that there will be
        an insignificant impact on the average American family's
        and Canadian family's food prices. </P><P>While generally neither American families nor Canadian
        families own and operate diesel-powered vehicles, certain
        diesel-powered vehicles are becoming more popular within
        these markets. Given current economic hardships, filling
        up at the pump is often a significant burden on today's
        families and thus we wanted to illustrate how consumers
        could save on each tank if they were driving in Toronto, New
        York and Los Angeles. The table below represents the cost
        breakdown and estimated local price of our fuel relative
        that to the local cost of diesel. Estimates were also made
        for the local price of an 80% diesel 20% biodiesel mixture,
        which represents the current largest biodiesel substitution
        feasible in current infrastructure. </P><CENTER><TABLE class="figure"><TBODY><TR class="top"><TH>Costs USD/Litre</TH><TH>Toronto</TH><TH>New York</TH><TH>Los Angeles</TH></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Production Costs</TH><TD>0.24</TD><TD>0.24</TD><TD>0.24</TD></TR><TR><TH>Add 10% for Distribution and Profit</TH><TD>0.02</TD><TD>0.02</TD><TD>0.02</TD></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Add Federal and Local Fuel Taxes (not inclusive of sales tax)</TH><TD>0.25<SUP>vi</SUP></TD><TD>0.12<SUP>vii</SUP></TD><TD>0.10</TD></TR><TR><TH>Local Cost of Diesel</TH><TD>1.25<SUP>viii</SUP></TD><TD>0.95<SUP>ix</SUP></TD><TD>0.94<SUP>x</SUP></TD></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Total Retail Cost of Our Diesel</TH><TD>0.51</TD><TD>0.39</TD><TD>0.36</TD></TR><TR><TH>Local Cost for 80% Diesel 20% Biodiesel Mixture</TH><TD>1.10</TD><TD>0.83</TD><TD>0.82</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><SUP>*</SUP>denotes that the prices were converted using XE.com at 11:29UTC 2011-09-15

        tax to our fuel, it represents a significant cost savings
        to consumers in both direct and 20% substitution. </P><P>To further exemplify the cost savings associated with
        our alternative biodiesel usage, we compared the estimated
        fill up cost of a 55L Diesel Engine Volkswagen Jetta and
        a 60L Diesel Engine Chevy Cruise. These models are two of
        the most common diesel powered vehicles on American and

        uncommon in North America, use of such vehicles in Europe is
        incredibly popular. To emphasize the impact of such a trend
        reaching North America and the potential savings to families,
        we decided to end this cost analysis with data on current
        gasoline expenditures. While reading these data, keep in mind
        that our production processes represented a savings of 32%
        and that similar savings could be observed should similar
        advances be made in gasoline production processes.</P><H4>The American Family</H4><P>According to the 2009 American Consumer Expenditure
        Survey, the average family with dependents has an average
        annual expenditure $68,841 USD or $72494.24 USD after
        adjusting for inflation.<SUP>xi</SUP> Of these expenditures,
        gasoline accounts for $2,868 USD or $3020.20 USD after
        adjusting for inflationi. (Inflation is based on a rate of
        5.3%.) </P><P>If the price of fuel could be reduced by a similar 32%,
        the average American family with dependants could save
        $996.46 USD per year. This reflects upon direct savings
        seen at the gas service station. </P><P>Moreover, further potential savings could be incurred
        resulting from reduced transportation costs of various
        household goods.</P><H4>The American Individual</H4><P>Similarly, the average American individual with no
        spouse and no dependents spent an average of $1,360 USD on
        gasoline in 2009. After adjusting the figures for inflation,
        in 2011 the amount spent on fuel would approximately be
        $1432 USD. Taking the savings of 32% we could reduce those
        expenditures by $458 USD. </P><H4>The Canadian Family</H4><P>According to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian
        household will spend 3.8% of their income on motor vehicle
        fuel.<SUP>xii</SUP> The average Canadian family with
        two children and two working adults earned $85,600 CDN
        in 2009 according to Statistics Canada. After adjusting
        for inflation that would be approximately 90,000 CDN in
        2011.<SUP>xiii</SUP> Given the 3.8% expenditure on motor
        vehicle fuel and applying this to the adjusted income
        yields $3420 CDN, an estimate on the total amount of money
        spent on gasoline and fuel products for a typical Canadian
        family. Again, this value could be reduced by 32%, yielding
        $1094 CDN in annual cost savings.</P><H3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</H3><P>If our product can successfully scale into commercial
        production it holds much potential to change the future of
        energy in countries. Our estimates clearly show the potential
        economic viability of such an alternative fuel. Therefore,
        not only environmentally, but also economically as seen
        here, there is significant reason to further investigate
        our approaches as a means for providing lower </P><H3 id="references">References</H3><OL id="reference-list"><LI>U.S Department of Energy Alternative Fuel Price report website: Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Price Report, January 2011: <A href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/afpr_jan_11.pdf">Link</A></LI><LI>The Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing website: <A href="http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2011/Pages/StatisticsDefinitions.aspx">Link</A></LI><LI>U.S Department of Energy Alternative Fuel Price report website: Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Price Report, January 2011: <A href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/afpr_jan_11.pdf ">Link</A></LI><LI>Natural Resource Canada website: <A href="http://www2.nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/sources/pripri/prices_bycity_e.cfm?PriceYear=0&amp;ProductID=1&amp;LocationID=66,8,39,17#PriceGraph">Link</A> (accessed September 15 2011, 6:08AM MST) </LI><LI>Natural Resources Canada website: <A href="http://www2.nrcan.gc.ca/eneene/sources/pripri/prices_bycity_e.cfm?PriceYear=0&amp;ProductID=5&amp;LocationID=66,8,39,17">Link</A> (accessed September 15 2011, 6:05AM MST) </LI><LI>Finance Canada website: <A href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/toc/2006/gas_tax-eng.asp ">Link</A></LI><LI>The Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing website: <A href="http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Resources/campaigns/GasPrices_2011/Pages/StatisticsDefinitions.aspx">Link</A></LI><LI>The Government of Ontario Ministry of Energy Fuel Prices website: <A href="http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/energy/oilandgas/?page=fuel-price-data&amp;fuel=dsl&amp;year=2011">Link</A></LI><LI>U.S Department of Energy Alternative Fuel Price report website: Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Price Report, January 2011: <A href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/afpr_jan_11.pdf ">Link</A></LI><LI>U.S Department of Energy Alternative Fuel Price report website: Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Price Report, January 2011: <A href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/pdfs/afpr_jan_11.pdf ">Link</A></LI><LI>Bureau of Labor Statistics website: <A href="http://www.bls.gov/cex/2009/Standard/cucomp.pdf ">Link</A></LI><LI>Statistics Canada website: <A href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/080814/dq080814a-eng.htm ">Link</A></LI><LI>Bank of Canada website: <A href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/">Link</A></LI></OL></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content-footer-box"><DIV class="footer-left-half"><DIV class="footer-left-col"><P><B>About our Wiki</B></P><P>Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer.
