Team Alberta is committed to the continued advancement         of synthetic biology. In addition to sharing our project         with the public through community outreach initiatives,         Team Alberta made a notable effort to share our project with         the local academic community prior to the iGEM competition         itself. Our team composed and submitted a project         abstract for publication to the University of Alberta         Undergraduate Research Journal, Eureka.
Eureka is both a student-founded and student-run         initiative at the University of Alberta whose mission is         to promote world-class undergraduate research conducted         throughout the Faculty of Science. The journal was founded         with the hopes of engaging undergraduate researchers         in academic publication as most undergraduate students         have limited opportunities to experience the publication         process as part of their scientific education.
Submitting         an abstract for publication to this journal provided us         with the invaluable experience of proceeding through a         peer-review process of our work. For some of us, it was         our first opportunity to submit a piece of scientific work         for publication.
With minor revisions, the abstract that we had submitted         was subsequently accepted for publication and the piece         will appear in the upcoming fall issue of the journal.
