are many paths that we could pursue in the future to further expand
and improve on our project.</P><OL><LI>Computer Metabolic Modeling: The goal would be to use computational
models of metabolic pathways in closely related organisms in an
attempt to identify further genes of interest in the fatty acid
synthesis pathway. Ideally such genes would allow for the maximum
accumulation of fatty acids in the N. crassa cells with the minimum
impact on cell growth and division. In the end this would hopefully
enable us to develop the most efficient strain possible for our
bioreactor.</LI><LI>Growth Media: Further research into various types of growth media
would potentially allow a greater variety of wastes to be used in our
bioreactors. Having a wide variety of potential wastes to use in our
bioreactor is very important. Depending on the time of year, local
geography, climate and location, different wastes might be available.
By characterizing these wastes and N. crassa's ability to grow on
them, we could create a more universal bioreactor, allowing consumers
to get the greatest yields from their investments.</LI><LI>Large Scale Bioreactor: The creation of a safe, efficient and
energy positive large-scale community based bioreactor would be the
pinnacle of our project. Such a bioreactor would not only allow a
community to be a step closer to energy independence, but also a step
closer to a more sustainable future. This local reactor could become
an integral part of the local economy as well by perhaps even paying
the locals to bring their waste to the plant and by providing a very
valuable resource to the community.</LI></OL><P>Developing a new chassis has been a very exciting endeavour for our
team. The possibilities are endless. That being said, the first set of
things to do would involve further developing the foundation of this
chassis. By developing this foundation to a greater extent, it would
give large toolkit for future iGEM teams</P><OL><LI>Promoters: The characterization and creation of parts out of a
variety of N. crassa promoters would be a great asset to the N. crassa
toolkit. N. crassa has many interesting and unique promoters. Such
promoters include a copper inducible promoter and several blue light
inducible promoters. There are also promoters related to the circadian
rhythm found in N. crassa. It would also be important to develop a
catalogue of promoters with varying degrees of expression. Not all
genes need to be expressed and extremely high levels, and
overexpression of certain genes could be deleterious to the modified
cells.</LI><LI>Terminators: A variety of terminators would be especially
beneficial to those who wanted to modify more than one locus in N.
crassa. The more copies of the same sequence that are present in a N.
crassa cell, the more likely there is to be homologous recombination
between those sites. If such an event occurred, it could result in
chromosomal rearrangements and deletions.</LI><LI>Resistance Markers: A wider selection of resistance markers would
allow future iGEM teams to choose a resistance marker that fits their
experiment more appropriately. Some antifungals might be less toxic
than others and certain antifungals might be less expensive than
others. Also one could do several genetic modifications in the same
strain and ensure that the resulting isolated strains contained all
the desired cassettes.</LI><LI>Phenotypic Markers: There are a variety of phenotypic markers that
would be a great addition to the N. Crassa toolkit. The most
fundamental one would be the coding sequence for a fluorescent protein
that displayed a consistent phenotype when adequately expressed whose
intensity varied on gene expression. The reason that this would be of
such great value is that it would allow one to easily determine if a
gene was being expressed and in what levels. This would create a very
simple and elegant method of testing promoters and terminators. One
could even compare various promoters to determine their relative
strengths.</LI><LI>Auxotrophic strains: Currently, there are a wide variety of
auxotrophic strains that have been very well characterized in N.
crassa.  Not only do auxotrophic strains allow for a higher level of
biosafety (eg. It is difficult for the auxotrophic strain to survive
in the wild), but it would also possibly allow for the development of
genetically engineered N. Crassa strains without resistance markers.
By creating cassettes with the complimentary genes, it would be
possible to easily identify transformed strains without the use of
antifungals, allowing for even safer transformation procedures and
protocols.</LI><LI>Cre-Lox Recombinase System: The development of a Cre-Lox
recombinase system as a potential engineering tool would be very
beneficial to future iGEM teams. By creating a functional Cre-Lox
recombinase system it would be possible to completely remove
antifungal resistance genes after genetic modification and antifungal
selection. N. crassa is unique in that it can create heterokaryons;
fused cells with different nuclei. One can do this by inoculating
opposite sides of a petri dish with different strains of the same
mating type. Where the two meet they will form heterokaryons. By
surrounding the antifungal resistance genes in the cassette with Lox
sequences, one is essentially creating a region that the Cre
recombinase can splice out. One would create heterokaryons by allowing
the genetically modified strain with the Lox flanked resistance gene
to grow beside the strain containing Cre recombinase. If the strain
with Cre recombinase were auxotrophic, it would be relatively easy to
purify the new strain with the resistance gene excised. One would just
need to replate the resulting cells on an minimal media (to inhibit
the growth of the cells whose nuclei contain Cre recombinase) and
replicate plate the resulting colonies on the antifungal containing
medium. This would allow one to select the colonies whose antifungal
resistance gene has been removed. By plating a couple generations on
minimal media, one could ensure that no Cre containing heterokaryons
still present, and that all one would have left are homokaryons
without the antifungal resistance gene.</LI><LI>Mating: The development of efficient mating protocols would allow
the development of a system that has the precision and ease of genetic
manipulation of the mus strain, but allows the creation of a
genetically modified strain without the mus phenotype. To do this, one
would do all their genetic manipulation in the mus strain. They would
then mate their modified strain with a wildtype strain and select for
the mus negative strains that contain the modified insert. This would
work best if all manipulated genes were on the same chromosome, but
not the one that the mus deletion was on.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content-footer-box"><DIV class="footer-left-half"><DIV class="footer-left-col"><P><B>About our Wiki</B></P><P>Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer.
