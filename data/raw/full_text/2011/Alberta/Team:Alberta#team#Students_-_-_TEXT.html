This year, the University of Alberta team, Team Alberta,         was composed of seven undergraduate students who represent         four departments across our campus. We worked tirelessly in a         lab throughout the entire summer, conducting our project and         making the ambitious plans that we had set out to complete         a reality. Along the way, we gained invaluable lab experience         and had a memorable summer working together.
Each team member's diverse skills, background, and         talents were most important to our success. Please click         on each student's photo on the right-hand side below to learn         more about them and to read their submitted biography.

Kayla Baretta
I am in my fourth year of a Bachelors of Science in             Biochemistry and my first year of iGEM. I plan on             pursuing a career in research and I felt that iGEM             would be a unique experience and opportunity to not             only meet people from around world, but to also broaden             my understanding of science within and outside of the             scientific community. When I am not pursuing my studies,             I enjoy making cupcakes, reading, playing with my dog,             and eating cupcakes.
Adam Foster
I have an undergrad in General Science, with a focus on Genetics and Organic Chemistry.  I tried an After Degree in Education, but did not complete it. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, and am seeking a diagnosis for Irlen Syndrome.
In addition to iGEM this summer, I am researching a novel pigment pathway; however, I'm not motivated to do research as a career. I hope to work at the local museum as a curator, and conduct my research as a hobbyist. I currently maintain approximately 50 temperate and tropical vivaria of orchids, geckos, frogs and boa constrictors, with a focus on Amazonian, Indonesian, Madagascan, and New Caledonian rainforests. I also have a blue eyed, all white cat, and a very understanding wife. One day, I would like to visit the ecosystems that I am so fascinated with.
Yuan Guo
Hello! I am in my fourth year of a B Sc. Hon. in Biochemistry. This is my first year of iGEM and I am having a great time so far. I got involved with iGEM because it was an unique opportunity for to meet some fellow science students from around the world. Furthermore, it was the perfect chance to put the knowledge obtained in classrooms to practical use.
Raymond Odsen
My name is Raymond Odsen and I am going into my fourth year in a B Sc. Hon. in Biochemistry. I think biochemistry is an awesome way to enter the scientific community,and I got into the iGEM project because I wanted a practical laboratory experience and the chance to work in a student-directed environment. My focus in studies is in the environmental and chemical aspects of biochemical manipulation, as well as the physics behind biochemical pathways and techniques. I plan to do an honors thesis next year in purifying proteins involved in the progression of breast cancer; I am very much looking forward to it. When not in the lab, I like to think about the lab and consider marrying the lab.
Murray Pelech
I recently completed my Baccalaureates sciences at the University of Alberta with a major in biology and minor in chemistry.
Michael Simpson
I have just completed my undergraduate degree with a B Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. Currently, I am seeking to pursue graduate studies at the University of Alberta. iGEM allows me to become more familiar with genetics and synthetic biology.
Helen Zakrzewski
Currently, I am in my last year of a B Sc. Hon. in Immunology and Infection and I recently completed my undergraduate honors thesis, which focused on determining the role of natural killer cells in the induction of chimerism and transplantation tolerance. Though to some extent outside the scope of my previous experiences, I was drawn to iGEM as the competition allows students from a variety of backgrounds to collaborate on a unique project and oversee its completion from concept to presentation. In my spare time I enjoy snowboarding and taking my Labrador Retriever on runs through our river valley. (photo disclaimer - I wrote a 5.5 hour exam the morning of our afternoon photo shoot and hadn't slept in days)
About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
