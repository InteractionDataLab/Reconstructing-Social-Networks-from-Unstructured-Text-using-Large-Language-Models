Project Overview
Our project aims to take relatively unused biomass and         create a useable fuel. We wanted to prove that biofuel         was not only an economically viable alternative but also         a realistic approach that allowed for ease of use, without         significant challenges to current infrastructure.
We divided the scientific aspect of our project into         three sections: growth, genetics, and esterification. Growth         focussed on comparing the growth of Neurospora on different         substrates.  Genetics aimed at manipulating fatty acid         regulation and production.  As well, much documentation         was carried out on determining the ideal conditions for         genetic construction in Neurospora - the product of this         work being a new RFC. Esterification aspired to form an         efficient and an affordable means of taking the fatty acids         from Neurospora and creating a viable fuel.

About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
