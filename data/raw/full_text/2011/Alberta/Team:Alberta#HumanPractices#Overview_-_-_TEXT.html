Overview
Alternative Fuel Report
Despite being innovative, biofuels may pose ethical dilemmas. Our alternative fuel report outlines many of the arguments both for or against increased biofuel use and development and how our approach to biodiesel synthesis resolves these issues.

Cost Analysis
Synthetic biology has allowed us to make biodiesel synthesis more cost-efficient, providing notable savings to the everyday consumer. See our number-crunching in action on our cost analysis page.

Bioreactor Design
Science is only useful if it can be applied for practical purposes. Team Alberta's bioreactor design promises to be a feasible option for incorporating our biodiesel production into communities. Check out the steps we completed in the design of this apparatus on our bioreactor design page.

Governmental Involvement
Public awareness is important; but, the real power for change lies with elected government officials. Team Alberta reached out to several politicians and met with three prominent government officials to discuss the future of fuel in our communities. Learn more on our governmental involvement page.

Eureka
We're famous! Team Alberta submitted an abstract for publishing, which was subsequently accepted, to the Eureka Undergraduate Science Research Journal. See our road to academic publication on our Eureka page.

Mentorship
Team Alberta helped others discover the fun of genetics and the potential of synthetic biology! Summer camps and high school research programs both visited the Team Alberta lab over the summer. View our show-and-tell skills on our mentorship page.

Conferences
Learning is best when surrounded by those with similar interests. Find out more about the workshops and conferences Team Alberta attended throughout the summer on our conferences page.

About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
