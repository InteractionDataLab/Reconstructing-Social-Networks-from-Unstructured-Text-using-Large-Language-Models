The first AITF conference of the 2011 iGEM season was held at the
University of Calgary in May. The three iGEM teams from Alberta were
present. It was an excellent opportunity for the different teams to
meet each other and learn together. Dr Peter Facchini from the
University of Calgary started off by showing us his synthetic biology
program. He and his PhytoMetaSyn team are working on elucidating the
pathway and thereby enzymes involved in the production of morphine and
other medically relevant metabolites in the opium poppies. </P><P>During this
conference we had the opportunity to discuss our nascent projects with
4 professionals who are very well respected in their respective fields.
Dr Facchini went over the science behind our iGEM projects and was
very helpful in pointing out the weaknesses in our scientific
strategies and offered some practical solutions to them. Dr. Samantha
Sutton from the Handel Group gave us pointers on how to work together
as a group. Dr. Michael Mehta, the Dean of Arts from Thompson Rivers
University and Lori Sheremeta, a lawyer from the National Institute
for Nanotechnology, helped us by going over and scrutinizing the legal,
ethical and social implications of our iGEM projects. They also
discussed the ramifications of intellectual property with us and how
it applied to our iGEM projects. Anne Marie Downey of Downey Norris &amp;
Associates gave us a lecture on effective communication techniques. In
it, we were taught how to present effectively and confidently. She
gave us useful tips on non-verbal communication and keeping our
audience interested in our presentations. She finished off by telling
us how to handle questions, especially sensitive ones, in a
professional manner. The first AITF conference of 2011 proved to be an
important and fun start to the iGEM season.
</P><H3>AITF Workshop 2 </H3><P>The second AITF conference of the 2011 iGEM season was an important
introduction to the Business of Science. It was held at the University
of Calgary and the three iGEM teams from Alberta attended. Don Chapman
from Kent Imaging Inc. and Randy Thomson, entrepreneur in residence at
NAIT were the keynote speakers. They taught us how to summarize our
projects in a concise manner that explained them clearly and created
interest in them. They emphasized the importance of protecting
intellectual property in this technological day and age. Also stressed
was the key in finding a need that was currently unmet and ensuring
that that need would still be there in the future. We were also
briefed on the concepts of marketing, valuation and funding. </P><P>All three
groups gave rudimentary iGEM presentations after which we had breakout
sessions with Lisa Brown, Dr. Wayne Materi and Dr. Prassana Bhomkar.
In those sessions we discussed the science behind our projects, were
given relevant pointers on how to tweak our projects and were given
advice on how we could improve our presentations.</P><P>The weekend wrapped
up by a talk from Cheryl Croucher, host of Innovation Anthology. She
spoke to us about the importance of making our science accessible to
the public. This is not only important because it allows people
unfamiliar with our field to understand what we are doing, but also
because it helps cultivate a culture of trust between the scientists
and the general public. The second AITF conference was key to the
development of our iGEM projects and challenged us both on group and
personal levels.
    </P><H3>ISMOS-3</H3><P>ISMOS 3 was held at the University of Calgary from July 13 to 15, 2011.
ISMOS3, the third International Symposium on Applied Microbiology and
Molecular Biology in Oil Systems, was a conference where scientists
from around the world came to explain their research in microorganisms
related to coal, oil, and the oil sands. Two students from the team
Alberta iGEM team, Murray and Kayla, attended. </P><P>There were many topics
that were brought up that were interesting and relevant. The first was
challenges in oil sands development where the key issues pertaining to
tailings ponds were discussed. Many scientists were trying to assess
the huge diversity of microorganisms and enormous number of
operational taxonomic units in relatively benign and hostile
environments found at sources of coal and oil. To do this they used
both 16S RNA sequencing and the determination of the presence of
sequences pertaining to specific classes of enzymes such as those
involved in methanogenesis. There were even scientists who were
characterizing the enzymes found in the extremophiles and trying to
determine if they were of medical, scientific or industrial
importance. The roles that microorganisms play in souring of oil
wells, as well as the roles they play in industrial corrosion were
also covered.  The breakdown of coal, oil and gas by microorganisms
was examined and shown to be very significant. Of particular interest
was the concept of microbial enhanced oil recovery and real data
showing that by giving the microorganisms in oil wells adequate
nutrients, one could recover a considerable amount of extra oil in a
very economically viable manner. </P><P>Attending the ISMOS3 conference
proved to be a valuable experience for Murray and Kayla, as it was
their first scientific conference. The scientists presenting their
research at the conference were personable and knowledgeable. The
poster sessions provided a great opportunity for learning. The
conference was an excellent overview on the large scale effect that
microorganisms have on our environment, the magnitude of their
diversity as well as the enormous potential that synthetic biology
could play in the future of the coal and oil industries.
</P><H3>aGEM</H3><P>aGEM is a mock iGEM competition held by Alberta Innovates
    Technology Futures (AITF). It was held this year in Edmonton,
    Alberta at AITF headquarters from Saturday September 24th
    to Sunday September 25th. Four teams were in attendance: the
    University of Lethbridge team, the University of Calgary team,
    the University of Alberta team, and one representative from
    the University of British Columbia. On the Saturday the teams
    gave presentations of their projects to the other teams and a
    panel of distinguished judges. The judges gave critiques and
    advice on how to improve the presentations for the iGEM regional
    competition. On the Sunday students had small
    group sessions with the judges and other experts to disscuss how
    to better achieve at iGEM, and how to become more involved in
    synthetic biology, and scientific research in general, in the
    future. These experts included:
    </P><UL><LI>Chris Dambrowitz, Director – Planning and Development, Alberta Research and Innovation Authority, Joanne Fox, Director – First Year Seminars, Michael Smith Laboratories at the University of British Columbia</LI><LI>Andrew Hessel, Founding Director, Pink Army Cooperative</LI><LI>Vincent Martin, Associate Professor in Microbial Genomics and Engineering, Concordia University</LI><LI>Wayne Materi, Chief Technology Officer, Carbonitum Energy Corporation</LI><LI>Stacey Ohlmann, Director of Industry Development, Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures</LI><LI>Nils Petersen, Professor in Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta</LI><LI>Candice Rockwell, Director of Strategic Partnerships, Alberta Innovates - Technology Future</LI><LI>Matthew Scott, Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics, University of Waterloo</LI><LI>Lori Sheremeta, Lawyer, Research Officer, National Institute for Nanotechnology</LI></UL><P>
Overall the experience was beneficial both for learning, and as a way to better prepare for the IGEM competition.
