NEUROSPORA CRASSA

Neurospora as a Chassis
In 1958, Tatum and Beadle won the Nobel Prize for proving         the one gene, one enzyme theory. The organism they chose         to prove their hypothesis in was the crux of genetics at         the time, Neurospora crassa.1 N. crassa is a model organism entrenched in scientific history         that has been used in over one hundred         years of research.
What better organism to introduce to synthetic biology         than one that stands at the basis of genetics?
N. crassa is a         suitable chassis.  It is listed as a biosafety         level 1 organism and it possesses a fully sequenced         genome. N. crassa is an easily manipulated,         multicellular, eukaryotic organism. However, the most         distinguishing aspect of N. crassa is         its natural ability to both degrade and use cellulose         as a feedstock, a characteristic that makes it ideal for biofuel and bioremediation studies.2 The lists of resources relating         to N. crassa are endless. Not only is there the Fungal Genetic Stock Center ,         which supplies strains, knockout cassettes, genes, and         information, but a quick search of the University of Alberta         library yielded over 7000 peer-reviewed articles alone. The         research and dedication that science has had to Neurospora is         clearly evident.
Neurospora's most difficult challenge in         the face of synthetic biology was gene synthesis; but,         as Team Alberta has shown in the past, the construction         of genetic constructs doesn't have to be difficult (see Team Alberta         2010: Genomikon ). We modified our genetic construction         system to fit Neurospora's genes and proposed it as         a standard for synthetic biology (see BBF RFC         82: Reusable, rapid assembly of genetic parts for Neurospora crassa).
Throughout the summer, Team Alberta has learned         a variety of techniques, methods, and protocols         (see Methodology ) for dealing with N. Crassa. It has been an exciting and eventful         learning curve and we are proud to be presenting N. crassa to the synthetic biology community as a         viable and useful chassis.

About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
