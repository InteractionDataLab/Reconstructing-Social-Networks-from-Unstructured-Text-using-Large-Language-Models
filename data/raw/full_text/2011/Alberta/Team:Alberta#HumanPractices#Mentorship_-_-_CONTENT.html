        about the world around us! </P><P>While most iGEM teams have historically focused on
        educational outreach in the high school setting, Team
        Alberta wanted to ensure that many students had a head-start 
        to their genetics education. </P><P>In August, Team Alberta invited campers ranging from grades 4-6 from the DiscoverE Summer Program
        into our lab space for a morning of fun-filled science
        activities! DiscoverE is an 'engaging activity-based'
        summer camp whose programs allow students to explore new
        ideas through hands-on projects related to a variety
        of fields in the science, engineering and technology
        disciplines. </P><P>Our science fun day activities included: </P><OL style="list-style-type:lower-roman"><LI>Presenting our project to students in an approachable and easily-understandable way! </LI><LI>Extracting DNA from strawberries! </LI><LI>Drinking delicious ice cream floats!</LI><LI>Sharing members of Adam's reptilian collection!</LI><LI>Experiencing the energy harnessed by chemical
            reactions through a Diet Pepsi - Mentos geyser! </LI></OL><P>We started the morning with Kayla presenting the
        educational video that she had created. The video was
        made with the intent of making our project approachable
        and understandable and it allowed the campers to get an
        overview of the large project that we've been attempting to
        undertake: &quot;Neurospora [...] proceeds to eat a variety of
        waste substances, this causes the Neurospora to get fatter
        and fatter&quot;. </P><P>Before the campers began extracting DNA from strawberries,
        Helena asked them about the molecule. When asked what is
        DNA and what does it do, these intelligent campers gave a
        range of responses including &quot;it determines whether you
        have brown eyes or blue eyes, brown hair or blonde hair&quot;
        and &quot;it's the instructions for living things.&quot; Team
        Alberta was incredibly impressed when one camper was even
        able to tell us that &quot;DNA is like a spirally ladder
        - a helix!&quot;  </P><P>But why only talk about DNA? In contrast to traditional
        iGEM outreach programs which generally only lecture about
        DNA, Team Alberta provided campers with the opportunity
        to see the molecule they were learning about! In our
        lab, campers were given the opportunity to extract
        DNA from purchased strawberries through an isopropanol
        precipitation procedure! The experiment provided campers
        with the opportunity not only to observe what DNA looks
        like to the naked eye but also to learn that DNA is found
        in everything living and once living, including the food
        that we eat. If you would like to repeat our experiment
        you can find the instructions <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2011/8/8c/Strawberry_DNA_Protocol.pdf">here</A>.</P><P>Next, Adam shared three members of his large reptilian
        collection with the campers while they enjoyed root beer
        floats. In addition to talking about the climates that these
        species live in, he also reemphasized to the campers that
        DNA is also found within these interesting creatures. </P><P>Energy being the focus of our project, Team Alberta
        wanted to complete the morning with a fun and exciting
        demonstration that visually allowed the campers to see the
        energy that could be released from chemical reactions. Ray and
        Mike were the brave members of our team who volunteered to
        exhibit that much energy could be released from the reaction
        of Diet Pepsi and Mentos.</P><P>Through these activities we hope that we achieved our
        goals of teaching the campers about the roles of DNA and
        the variety of organisms in which it is found, making DNA
        more approachable to younger individuals, and providing
        the campers with a memorable experience. </P><H3 id="wisest">Women in Scholarship, Engineering, Science and Technology
            (WISEST) Lab Tours </H3><P>Students from the WISEST program visited Team Alberta
        over the lunch hour on two occasions.  The WISEST Summer
        Research Program provides young women that have completed
        grade 11 with the opportunity to gain experience in science
        or engineering settings by working as research assistants
        throughout the summer. </P><P>Students were given a tour of our lab, a brief overview
        of the iGEM competition and our project itself.  They were
        also given the opportunity to view our race tubes, to
        count conidia on a hemocytometer and to view an undergoing
        esterification reaction.</P><P>But, science is often unapproachable. Students may listen
        to a talk, but retain little. Instead, Team Alberta invited
        these students to sit down for lunch over pizza and discuss
        synthetic biology and perhaps any apprehensions that they may
        have about the field. In an informal environment, our team
        members described the field to students and its applications
        and answered any questions that were posed. Students were
        also provided with the opportunity to ask team members
        general questions about their experiences as undergrad
        students. </P><P>To determine whether our team had achieved its goals
        through conducting these lab tours, students in attendance
        were all sent an anonymous, voluntary electronic feedback
        survey. Though thirty-six WISEST students attended the
        tours on both days combined, nineteen students provided
        responses. The following is intended as a summary of the
        results of this survey.</P><P>WISEST students were asked to anonymously select which
        statements they agreed with. </P><CENTER><TABLE class="figure"><TBODY><TR class="top"><TH>Response</TH><TH>Number of Students in Agreement (/19)</TH><TH>Percentage</TH></TR><TR class="odd"><TH>Yes, I did not know what synthetic biology

        our team is confident that we achieved all the goals that we
        had hoped to in conducting these tours. </P><H3 id="hyrs">Heritage Youth Researcher Summer (HYRS) Program Lab Tour</H3><P>Team Alberta was also given the opportunity to share our
        project and knowledge about synthetic biology with students
        from the HYRS program. HYRS is a summer studentship program
        developed and funded by the Alberta Heritage Foundation for
        Medical Research (AHFMR) that provides both male and female
        students who have completed grade 11 with experience in the
        sciences at provincial universities. </P><P>Similarly, students were given a tour of our lab and an
        overview of the iGEM competition in addition to the opportunity
        to view the many interesting experiments conducted as part of
        our project such as our race tube experiments. As well, these
        students were invited to participate in an informal discussion about synthetic biology over
        over pizza and to ask questions of our
        team. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="content-footer-box"><DIV class="footer-left-half"><DIV class="footer-left-col"><P><B>About our Wiki</B></P><P>Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer.
