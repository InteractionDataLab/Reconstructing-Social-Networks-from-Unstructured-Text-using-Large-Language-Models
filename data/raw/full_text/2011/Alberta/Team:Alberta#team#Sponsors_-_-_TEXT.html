Team Alberta is extremely grateful to the many sponsors         who supported our endeavors. Our project would not have         been possible without the kind assistance provided by these         institutions, companies, and organizations.
Sponsors, thank you for your contributions and for         your enthusiasm about the iGEM competition, our team,         and our project.
