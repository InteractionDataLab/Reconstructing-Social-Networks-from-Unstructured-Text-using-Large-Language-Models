Dr. Michael Ellison
Department of Biochemistry
At the beginning of his career, Mike Ellison's interests were primarily centered on the structure and function of complex biomolecules. More recently his interests have tended towards the possibility of constructing synthetic biological devices that perform useful functions.  As Synthetic Biology theme leader of the Bioconversions network, his current efforts are directed toward the creation of microbial systems with the capacity to produce high value chemical feedstocks from provincially available sources of biomass. He continues to be a strong advocate for innovative science. He has served on the boards of Genome Prairie, the Alberta Network for Proteomic Innovation and has played a major role in bringing new technologies to the university through two multi-million dollar investments from the Canada Foundation for Innovation.
Dr. Douglas Ridgway
Department of Biochemistry
After a background in physics, Dr. Ridgway worked in computational modeling in both industry and academia, and is currently a researcher in Biochemistry at the University of Alberta. 2011 marks his fifth year advising U of A iGEM teams.

Collaborators
Kaylee Bohaychuk
Kaylee Bohaychuk is a computing science student at the University of Alberta with plans to pursue veterinary studies in the near future. She donated her time to help Team Alberta with its wiki website throughout the summer.
Lisa Brown
Lisa Brown is completing her Ph. D. in Geoenvironmental Engineering. Specifically, her research focusses on treatment options for oil sands tailing ponds. She has been an invaluable resource to our team throughout the completion of our bioreactor design.
Stephen Jahns
Steve Jahns is an iGEM team veteran as this marks his third year in helping with Team Alberta's efforts. After spending time in the science and engineering departments at the University of Alberta, Steve is currently pursuing a degree in computing science. This year, he was an invaluable help in aiding our team with wiki design and coding and he has most definitely earned the beer (or three) that he was promised when he agreed to help our team again this year.
Skye Oleson-Cormack
Skye, who is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Design degree at the University of Alberta, lent her artistic talents to Team Alberta throughout the summer. She kindly donated her time to create several images and diagrams for our team, which allowed us to more easily communicate our project to a wider audience.
Alex Siu
Alex Siu is a student of the University of Alberta School of Business.  Previously, he earned a B. Sc. Specialization in Pharmacology from the same school. He has aided our team in completing the Cost Analysis Report, which was incorporated into the Human Practices portion of our project.
About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
