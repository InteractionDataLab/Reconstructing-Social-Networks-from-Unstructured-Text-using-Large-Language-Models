DiscoverE Science Fun Day
Science - it's never too early to start learning         about the world around us!
While most iGEM teams have historically focused on         educational outreach in the high school setting, Team         Alberta wanted to ensure that many students had a head-start          to their genetics education.
In August, Team Alberta invited campers ranging from grades 4-6 from the DiscoverE Summer Program         into our lab space for a morning of fun-filled science         activities! DiscoverE is an 'engaging activity-based'         summer camp whose programs allow students to explore new         ideas through hands-on projects related to a variety         of fields in the science, engineering and technology         disciplines.
Our science fun day activities included:
Presenting our project to students in an approachable and easily-understandable way!
Extracting DNA from strawberries!
Drinking delicious ice cream floats!
Sharing members of Adam's reptilian collection!
Experiencing the energy harnessed by chemical             reactions through a Diet Pepsi - Mentos geyser!
We started the morning with Kayla presenting the         educational video that she had created. The video was         made with the intent of making our project approachable         and understandable and it allowed the campers to get an         overview of the large project that we've been attempting to         undertake: "Neurospora [...] proceeds to eat a variety of         waste substances, this causes the Neurospora to get fatter         and fatter".
Before the campers began extracting DNA from strawberries,         Helena asked them about the molecule. When asked what is         DNA and what does it do, these intelligent campers gave a         range of responses including "it determines whether you         have brown eyes or blue eyes, brown hair or blonde hair"         and "it's the instructions for living things." Team         Alberta was incredibly impressed when one camper was even         able to tell us that "DNA is like a spirally ladder         - a helix!"
But why only talk about DNA? In contrast to traditional         iGEM outreach programs which generally only lecture about         DNA, Team Alberta provided campers with the opportunity         to see the molecule they were learning about! In our         lab, campers were given the opportunity to extract         DNA from purchased strawberries through an isopropanol         precipitation procedure! The experiment provided campers         with the opportunity not only to observe what DNA looks         like to the naked eye but also to learn that DNA is found         in everything living and once living, including the food         that we eat. If you would like to repeat our experiment         you can find the instructions here .
Next, Adam shared three members of his large reptilian         collection with the campers while they enjoyed root beer         floats. In addition to talking about the climates that these         species live in, he also reemphasized to the campers that         DNA is also found within these interesting creatures.
Energy being the focus of our project, Team Alberta         wanted to complete the morning with a fun and exciting         demonstration that visually allowed the campers to see the         energy that could be released from chemical reactions. Ray and         Mike were the brave members of our team who volunteered to         exhibit that much energy could be released from the reaction         of Diet Pepsi and Mentos.
Through these activities we hope that we achieved our         goals of teaching the campers about the roles of DNA and         the variety of organisms in which it is found, making DNA         more approachable to younger individuals, and providing         the campers with a memorable experience.
Women in Scholarship, Engineering, Science and Technology             (WISEST) Lab Tours
Students from the WISEST program visited Team Alberta         over the lunch hour on two occasions.  The WISEST Summer         Research Program provides young women that have completed         grade 11 with the opportunity to gain experience in science         or engineering settings by working as research assistants         throughout the summer.
Students were given a tour of our lab, a brief overview         of the iGEM competition and our project itself.  They were         also given the opportunity to view our race tubes, to         count conidia on a hemocytometer and to view an undergoing         esterification reaction.
But, science is often unapproachable. Students may listen         to a talk, but retain little. Instead, Team Alberta invited         these students to sit down for lunch over pizza and discuss         synthetic biology and perhaps any apprehensions that they may         have about the field. In an informal environment, our team         members described the field to students and its applications         and answered any questions that were posed. Students were         also provided with the opportunity to ask team members         general questions about their experiences as undergrad         students.
To determine whether our team had achieved its goals         through conducting these lab tours, students in attendance         were all sent an anonymous, voluntary electronic feedback         survey. Though thirty-six WISEST students attended the         tours on both days combined, nineteen students provided         responses. The following is intended as a summary of the         results of this survey.
WISEST students were asked to anonymously select which         statements they agreed with.

Heritage Youth Researcher Summer (HYRS) Program Lab Tour
Team Alberta was also given the opportunity to share our         project and knowledge about synthetic biology with students         from the HYRS program. HYRS is a summer studentship program         developed and funded by the Alberta Heritage Foundation for         Medical Research (AHFMR) that provides both male and female         students who have completed grade 11 with experience in the         sciences at provincial universities.
Similarly, students were given a tour of our lab and an         overview of the iGEM competition in addition to the opportunity         to view the many interesting experiments conducted as part of         our project such as our race tube experiments. As well, these         students were invited to participate in an informal discussion about synthetic biology over         over pizza and to ask questions of our         team.
