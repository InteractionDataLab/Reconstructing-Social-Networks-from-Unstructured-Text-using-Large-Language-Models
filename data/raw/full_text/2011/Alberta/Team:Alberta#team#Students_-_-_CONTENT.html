        was composed of seven undergraduate students who represent
        four departments across our campus. We worked tirelessly in a
        lab throughout the entire summer, conducting our project and
        making the ambitious plans that we had set out to complete
        a reality. Along the way, we gained invaluable lab experience
        and had a memorable summer working together.</P><P>Each team member's diverse skills, background, and
        talents were most important to our success. Please click
        on each student's photo on the right-hand side below to learn
        more about them and to read their submitted biography.</P><H3 id="team-member">Team Members</H3><DIV class="student-bio" id="kayla-bio"><H4>Kayla Baretta</H4><P>
            I am in my fourth year of a Bachelors of Science in
            Biochemistry and my first year of iGEM. I plan on
            pursuing a career in research and I felt that iGEM
            would be a unique experience and opportunity to not
            only meet people from around world, but to also broaden
            my understanding of science within and outside of the
            scientific community. When I am not pursuing my studies,
            I enjoy making cupcakes, reading, playing with my dog,
            and eating cupcakes.

I have an undergrad in General Science, with a focus on Genetics and
Organic Chemistry.  I tried an After Degree in Education, but did
not complete it. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome,
and am seeking a diagnosis for Irlen Syndrome.
            </P><P>
In addition to iGEM this summer, I am researching a novel pigment
pathway; however, I'm not motivated to do research as a career. I
hope to work at the local museum as a curator, and conduct my
research as a hobbyist. I currently maintain approximately 50
temperate and tropical vivaria of orchids, geckos, frogs and boa
constrictors, with a focus on Amazonian, Indonesian, Madagascan,
and New Caledonian rainforests. I also have a blue eyed, all white
cat, and a very understanding wife. One day, I would like to visit
the ecosystems that I am so fascinated with.

Hello! I am in my fourth year of a B Sc. Hon. in Biochemistry. This
is my first year of iGEM and I am having a great time so far. I got
involved with iGEM because it was an unique opportunity for to meet
some fellow science students from around the world. Furthermore, it
was the perfect chance to put the knowledge obtained in classrooms
to practical use.

My name is Raymond Odsen and I am going into my fourth year in a
B Sc. Hon. in Biochemistry. I think biochemistry is an awesome way
to enter the scientific community,and I got into the iGEM project
because I wanted a practical laboratory experience and the chance
to work in a student-directed environment. My focus in studies is in
the environmental and chemical aspects of biochemical manipulation,
as well as the physics behind biochemical pathways and techniques. I
plan to do an honors thesis next year in purifying proteins involved
in the progression of breast cancer; I am very much looking forward
to it. When not in the lab, I like to think about the lab and
consider marrying the lab.

I recently completed my Baccalaureates sciences at the University
of Alberta with a major in biology and minor in chemistry.

I have just completed my undergraduate degree with a B Sc. with
Specialization in Biochemistry. Currently, I am seeking to pursue
graduate studies at the University of Alberta. iGEM allows me to
become more familiar with genetics and synthetic biology.

Currently, I am in my last year of a B Sc. Hon. in Immunology and
Infection and I recently completed my undergraduate honors thesis,
which focused on determining the role of natural killer cells in
the induction of chimerism and transplantation tolerance. Though
to some extent outside the scope of my previous experiences, I was
drawn to iGEM as the competition allows students from a variety
of backgrounds to collaborate on a unique project and oversee its
completion from concept to presentation. In my spare time I enjoy
snowboarding and taking my Labrador Retriever on runs through our
river valley. (photo disclaimer - I wrote a 5.5 hour exam the
morning of our afternoon photo shoot and hadn't slept in days)
