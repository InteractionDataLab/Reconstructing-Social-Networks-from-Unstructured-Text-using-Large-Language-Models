Description
FadD 5'-UTR
BBa_K612001
This is the 5'-UTR of the FadD gene of N. crassa. It is suitable for creating constructs which can knockout the FadD gene, as well knock in new genes.
TesA' Whole Gene
BBa_K612002
The whole gene construct, with the TesA' open reading frame, the Actin promoter and the TrpC terminator
Hygromycin B
BBa_K612003
Acts as a selection marker for transformed N.Crass. Gives resistance to the antibiotic Hygromycin
FadD 3'-UTR
BBa_K612004
This is the 3'-UTR of the FadD gene of N. crassa. It is suitable for creating constructs which can knockout the FadD gene, as well knock in new genes.
Actin Promoter
BBa_K612005
A constitutive promoter used in the literature for genes transformed into N. crassa.
TrpC Terminator
BBa_K612007
A terminator used for N. crassa genes. It is also used in other fungus species.
TesA' CDS
BBa_K612008
The open reading frame for the TesA' gene. This is a thioesterase from E. coli which has been codon optimized for use in N. crassa. This thioesterase preferably cleaves off sixteen carbon fatty acids from the fatty acid synthase complex, producing free fatty acids.
Favourite Parts
So far only two parts (the 5'FadD region and the TrpC         terminator) have been put in IGEM plasmids for judging. The         5' FadD-UTR was made by using the N. crassa genome as a         template in a PCR, BsaI cut sites were added to each end         using the PCR primers. The TrpC terminator was synthesized         with the codon optimized TesA' and was taken out of that         part using PCR. The parts plasmids were checked by using         NotI and BsaI digestions and running the DNA on a gel. The         gels are shown below:

About our Wiki
Seven students from three departments across the University of Alberta campus aspired to complete an ambitious project over the course of the summer. This wiki is all about our successes and our many trials and tribulations.
