Cyanobacteria are know for special and unique metabolites. Some of these metabolites are part of the microviridin family. Special attributes of microviridins are their occurrence as tricyclic depsipeptides, which means peptides with one or more amide-bonds replaced by ester-bonds, unparalleled cage-like architecture, and the potential to inhibit proteases. Microviridin B, for example, has been reported to function as an elastase inhibitor what could be used as an therapeutic  attempt to fix the out-of-control function of elastase in lung emphysema. In such a case, it is beyond debate how important it is to figure out the biosynthesis of this peptide. The research group of Prof. Dittmann reported the composition of the gene cluster from <I>Micocystis aeruginosa</I> NIES298 expressing Microviridin B. Moreover they have been convinced that there is an unique biosynthetic mechanism for microviridins in <I>Microcystis</I> strains. Unusual for depsipeptides, they discovered that Microviridins are ribosomally synthesized. The <I>mdn</I> gene cluster contains the gene <I>mdnA</I>, encoding for the putative precursor peptide of the microvirdin, two genes encoding ATP-grasp-type ligases <I>mdnB</I> and <I>mdnC</I>, an ABC transporter encoding gene <I>mdnE</I> as well as one encoding an N-acetyltransferase of the GNAT family <I>mdnD</I> (Ziemert et al., 2008). In a recent study, they report the discovery of an existing natural diversity of microviridin precursors genes in set of closely related <I>Mycrocystis</I> laboratory strains. To give evidence of their discovery, they identified and characterized a new Microviridin L from the strain <I>Mycrocystis aeruginosa</I> NIES843 (Ziemert et al., 2010).
All in all the microviridins are build up through a gene cluster of five  mdn-components each fulfilling one specific function. It was shown that the peptide is only correctly processed in <I>E. coli</I> if the entire cluster <I>mdnABCDE</I> is expressed. In addition, the new discovery is indicating some flexibility of the microviridin ligases with an open window for the size of the natural microviridins, and thus, microviridin function and for potential therapeutic benefit that needs to be discovered. The following illustration is going to give you a better overview (Fig. 1).

Due to the sophisticated incorporation of the recognition sequences of the iGEM restriction enzymes into the primer sequence our BioBricks comply with the BioBrick standards.

Qualitative analysis involved running of a standard that contained the target analytes. The vectors pARW071 and pARW089 served as controls in our experiments, because these vectors contain the original mdn-cluster. We could use the retention time as a way to determine the presence of the microviridin production in other samples. HPLC analysis of the purified compound yielded a high peak with a retention time of approximately 5 min. Minor peaks could be detected during the following 7 min (Fig. 3).

</P><P>Fractions of the peaks were sampled and the identity of microviridin and also the presence of cyclization, which is important for the activity, was confirmed with mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). By using a mass spectrometer it is possible to determine both the elemental composition of a sample and deduce the chemical structure of molecules.

Therefore a number of sites in the amino acid sequence of the precursor peptide (MdnA) were chosen.
In <I>Microcystis</I>, microviridins are synthesized from a ribosomal precursor peptide (MdnA). Therefore the microviridin gene cluster is necessary. This 6.5 kb biosynthesis gene cluster includes two genes (<I>mdnB</I> and <I>mdnC</I>), which encodes ATP-grasp-type ligases and further the <I>mdnE</I> gene encoding an ABC transporter as well as<I> mdnD</I> gene encoding a N-acetyltransferase (Ziemert et al., 2008). In consequence the biosynthesis gene cluster genes <I>mdnB</I>, <I>mdnC</I>, <I>mdnD</I> and <I>mdnE</I> cannot be mutated. Otherwise only misprocessed and non-function variants of microviridin occur (Ziemert et al., 2008). Thus merely the modification of the <I>mdnA</I> gene can lead to effective changes in the microviridin structure and function. </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 5:</B> Molecular organization of the ribsosomal precursor peptide (MdnA) of microviridin. MdnA consists of a leader and a core peptide. The N-terminal leader peptide contains highly conserved double glycine motifs. Whereas in the C-terminal 14 amino acid sized core peptide sequence shows variations. Modified from Ziemert et al. (2008) and Ziemert et al. (2010).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>The precursor peptide MdnA consists of a leader peptide and a core peptide (Fig. 5). Ziemert et al. (2008) has shown that the N-terminal leader peptide contains highly conserved double glycine motifs (Ziemert et al. 2008). However remarkable variations were found in region, which encodes the 14-amino acid sequence of the C-terminal microviridin core peptide (Ziemert et al. 2010). Consequently, mutations in the MdnA core peptide seem to be the most promising option for modification of microviridin. For cyclization, the amino acid side chains of the core peptide form omega-ester and omega-amino bonds. One loop is formed between threonine and aspartic acid, the second loop between lysine and aspartic acid and the third loop between serine and glutamic acid (Fig. 5). The sequence of this loop forming amino acids constitute an exception while mutation of the <I>mdnA</I> gene (Ziemert et al., 2008 and 2010).
</P><P>To find optimized and novel microviridin variants, several libraries carrying modifications in the sequence of the MdnA core peptide were established. These libraries were generated by randomized oligonucleotide synthesis. Therefore a forward oligonucleotide displaying a part of conserved leader peptide sequence was built. Further a reverse oligonucleotide was created. The first part of this oligonucleotide is 20 bases, which overlap with the forward oligonucleotide and which is necessary for hybridization of both, forward and reverse, oligonucleotides. In the middle of the sequence modified bases were inserted. For cloning, the forward oligonucleotide starts with the blunt restricted site of <I>Sfo</I>I. This results therein that the oligonucleotide can ligate in the <I>Sfo</I>I restricted vector without previous digest of the oligonucleotide. The last part of the reverse oligonucleotides displays an <I>Aat</I>II restriction site for cloning. Digestion with <I>Aat</I>II results in sticky ends, thus wrong way round insertion of the oligonucleotide is impossible. Forward and reverse oligonucleotides were combined by performing a fill-in reaction. 
Because we designed several libraries with different diversity rates, the modified bases, which are inserted in the middle of the reverse primer, vary. All of our generated libraries contain mutations of the sequence of the MdnA core peptide at several sites, but not at the loop forming sites. Thus we are thinking that cyclization of microviridin happens accurately. A library with a diversity of 45,360 (focused library 1) and a second focused library showing a minor diversity of 810 (focused library 2) were designed. The included sequence modifications plus the diversity of our libraries are shown in figure 6. In our further studies we worked on focused library 2 primarily. In this library the nucleotide sequences encoding glycine residues were changed in GVK in all cases (Figure 6). GVK stands for guanine at the first position, adenine, cytosine or guanine at the second position and further thymine at the third position of the codon. These three possible codons encode for the amino acids alanine, aspartic acid and glycine. The nucleotide sequence N-terminal tyrosine residue was changed in THT describing thymine (first position), adenine, cytosine or thymine at the second position and thymine (third position). These codons encode isoleucine, leucine and phenylalanine. Additionally, the sequence of phenylalanine in the core peptide sequence was shift to NNK. NKK stands for one of the four nucleotides at the first position, and guanine or thymine at the second and third position. Consequently, this codon encodes the amino acids arginine, glycine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, valine, serine, cysteine, isoleucine and phenylalanine.

The definition of the used code is also shown. The first libray (focused library 1) displays a diversity of 45360 and the second, focused library 2 a diversity of 810. In the further studies focused library 2 was used to find optimized microviridin variants.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>To construct this library a fill-in reaction using the designed forward and reverse oligonucleotides was performed. Subsequently resulting randomized oligonucleotide was digested with the restriction enzyme <I>Aat</I>II. In addition, the vector pUP089 was digested with the restriction enzymes <I>Aat</I>II and <I>Sfo</I>I. After ligation of fragments, randomized oligonucleotide and vector, the focused library 2 (ligation product) was transformed in chemocompetent <I>E. coli</I> XL1-Blue cells. This procedure was done several times and a library size of 1233 colonies was reached.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Expression_Backbones"> Expression Backbones </SPAN></H3><P>In a subtask of our work we wanted to construct auxiliary expression backbones with inducible promotors.  In contrast to constitutive systems inducible systems only express the protein of interest after adding an inducer, which can be for example AHL or arabinose.
We decided to construct IPTG- and arabinose-inducible systems. Therefore we amplified the promotor region and fused it to a reporter gene, which is constituted by YFP. Using this we have the option to verify the presence of the inducible promotor and also the function of the induction process by fluorescence. Our idea was to use the reporter gene as a placeholder. Via restriction enzyme digestion using the iGEM restriction enzyme sites you will be able to replace the reporter gene with your gene of interest. As vector backbone we made use of the pSB1A3, which has ampicillin resistance (Fig. 9). The constructs using pSB1K3 (kanamycin resistance) and pSB1C3 (chloramphenicol resistance) are still on the anvil.

Using fluorescence microscopy we were able to detect the YFP-expression after an induction time of approximately 1.5 hrs. To prove the hypothesis we opposed an induced sample with a non-induced control for each promotor. By use of brightfield combined with differential interference contrast microscopy we traced the <I>E. coli</I> cells and switched then to the YFP detecting channel to investigate the fluorescence of these cells.

In this analyze the cells were excited by 500 nm.  The resultant emission was measured in a spectrum between 510 and 580 nm. (Fig 11;12)
