Data For Our New Favorite BioBricks
1. Main Page BBa_K627006 - Fusion part of mdnA gene (from mdn-cluster) with myc-tag and gene III: This BioBrick was used to demonstrate display of the cyclic peptide microviridin on a filamentous phage and to optimize phage selection in a controlled experiment. [More Wiki]
2. Main Page BBa_K627012 - Fusion of TorA sig-seq, TEV protease cleavage site and beta-lactamase: This BioBrick was demonstrated to be a sensitive sensor for protease activity with ideal dynamic range. It enables the in-vivo selection for protease inhibitors, since only cells with inhibited protease survive antibiotic challenge. beta-lactamase is only active in the periplasm of E. coli and cleavage of the TorA signal   prevents transport. [More Wiki]
3. Main Page BBa_K627001 - mdnA gene encoding the precursor peptide of the tricyclic microviridin: The mdnA gene is the most important part of our large mdn cluster from Microcystis aeruginosa. We purified Microviridin by HPLC and analyzed it by mass spectrometry. This gene sequence was used to generate our semi-rational gene synthesis library. [More Wiki]
Data For Pre-existing Parts
1. Experience BBa_I757010 - beta-lactamase TEM optimized: The beta-lactamase providing resistance against the antibiotic ampicillin was used in combination with signal sequence TorA. This fusion part displays a novel protease activity detector device, which shows an increased survival rate at 30°C and 37°C.
2. Experience BBa_K208005 - TorA Signal Peptide - Silver Fusion Compatible: The Silver-fusion compatible BioBrick BBa_K208005 is improved by  attaching a cleavage site for different proteases and the beta-lactamase providing resistance against the antibiotic ampicillin. A high export rate via the TAT pathway was proven.
We've Also Generated the Following Parts
1. Main Page BBa_K627000 - ABC transporter and N-acetyltransferase from mdn-cluster: The BioBrick BBa_K627000 is a part of the microviridin gene (mdn) cluster, which encodes the protease inhibitor microviridin L. The N-acetyltransferase and the ABC transporter encoded by the BioBrick BBa_K627000 are involved in the scaffold and cyclization of the microviridin peptide. [More Wiki]
2. Main Page BBa_K627002 - ATP-grasp-type ligase from mdn-cluster: The BioBrick BBa_K627002 is a part of the microviridin gene (mdn) cluster, which encodes the protease inhibitor microviridin L. The ATP-grasp-type ligase encoded by the BioBrick BBa_K627002 is involved in the scaffold and cyclization of the microviridin peptide. [More Wiki]
3. Main Page BBa_K627003 - ATP-grasp-type ligase from mdn-cluster: The BioBrick BBa_K627003 is a part of the microviridin gene (mdn) cluster, which encodes the protease inhibitor microviridin L. The ATP-grasp-type ligase encoded by the BioBrick BBa_K627003 is involved in the scaffold and cyclization of the microviridin peptide. [More Wiki]
4. Main Page BBa_K627004 - N-acetyltransferase from the mdn-cluster: The BioBrick BBa_K627004 is a part of the microviridin gene (mdn) cluster, which encodes the protease inhibitor microviridin L. The N-acetyltransferase encoded by the BioBrick BBa_K627004 is involved in the scaffold and cyclization of the microviridin peptide. [More Wiki]
5. Main Page BBa_K627005 - ABC transporter from the mdn-cluster: The BioBrick BBa_K627005 is a part of the microviridin gene (mdn) cluster, which encodes the protease inhibitor microviridin L. The ABC transporter encoded by the BioBrick BBa_K627005 is involved in the scaffold and cyclization of the microviridin peptide. [More Wiki]
6. Main Page BBa_K627008 , BBa_K627009 , BBa_K627010 - Fusion of AraC induction system and TEV protease: As a fusion of pBAD arabinose-inducible induction system and the TEV protease, this BioBrick can be used for cleaving fusion proteins. This TEV protease variant is resistant to many commonly used protease inhibitors. Equivalent parts exist for this BioBrick in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. [More Wiki]
7. Main Page BBa_K627007 - Fusion of c-myc-tag and gene III: The BioBrick BBa_K627007 can be used to fuse your gene of interest to gene III, which is responsible for infection of bacterial cells. Thus protein-protein interactions of the expressed protein of interest can be analyzed. For determination gene III is coupled to a c-terminal myc-tag. [More Wiki]
8. Main Page BBa_K627011 - Fusion part of pBAD arabinose-inducible induction system and the HRV 14_3C protease: This BioBrick expresses a protease inducibly and tightly controlled and was used to benchmark the protease detector. It is a prototypic viral peotease target for our microviridin inhibitor library. [More Wiki]
9. Main Page BBa_K627013 - Fusion of ssTorA, cleavage site of 14_3C protease and b-lactamase: The BioBrick BBa_K627013 consists of the cleavage site for the 14_3C protease, which is flanked by the sequence of the beta-lactamase and of the TorA signal. Thus the beta-lactamase can be transported into the periplasm and can provide resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ampicillin or penicillin. [More Wiki]
10. Main Page BBa_K627016 - Protease form the Tobacco Etch Virus: The BioBrick BBa_K627016 mutated TEV protease form Tobacco Etch Virus. [More Wiki]
