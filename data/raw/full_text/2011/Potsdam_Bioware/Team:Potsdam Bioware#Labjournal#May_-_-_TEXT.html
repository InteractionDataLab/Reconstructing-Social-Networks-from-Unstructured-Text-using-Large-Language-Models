1st Labday 12.05.2011
Preparative DNA Electrophoresis, Test Experiment 629, 654 digest
Investigators: Sascha, Jessica, Steffi, Sandrina, Nadine;
introduction by Kristian, Tobias, Tim
Aim: get used to the lab
Time: 13:40
Method:
Samples digested with AscI and NheI from Tim
vector: 629 source: Tobias; prep-type: ? ; prep-date: ; clone-no: ?
insert: 654 source: Tobias; prep-type: ? ; prep-date: ; clone-no: ?
Electrophoresis
sample preparation: 30 µl 629 (digested) + 6 µl 6x loading dye solution, 30 µl 654 (digested) + 6 µl 6x loading dye
0,5 g Agarose, 50 ml TAE (1%), 2 µl GelRed (3-6µl), at 100 Volt,running time: 30 minutes

Gel Extraction
DNA excision: lane 4: 6000 bp band and 3000 bp band; lane 7: 1700 bp band
DNA purification: with Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit according to Qiagen manual (incl. isopropanol step)
Result: size estimation by eye;
lanes 3+4: plasmid was digested, small band has the expected size, two upper bands with unexpected size;
lanes 6+7: plasmid was digested; 6000 bp unexpected; 4000 bp band might correspond to expected 4140 bp band, 1700 bp band above expected 1268 bp
Conclusions:
exact vector fragment unknown, therefore 6000 bp band and 3000 bp  band were excised from lane 4, lane 7: 1700 bp band was excised;
because of unexpected sizes marker should be compared with  another marker, plasmids should be digested to yield several fragments  for size control, maybe heat inactivation might help to resolve higher bands
Output: three plasmid fragments with 6000 bp (V1), 3000 bp (V2) and 1700 bp (I1) in 1,5 ml eppis,
stored at -20 °C, box with fragments
