Kyoto University
Kyoto University is the second oldest university in Japan, established in 1897. Kyoto is an ancient city, where there are a lot of historical features. We students are enjoying our university lives and studying in this quiet and calm atmosphere.
Kyoto University has produced the world's best and the brightest. Hideki YUKAWA, Japan's first Nobel laureate, was an alumnus and a professor of Kyoto University. Shinya YAMANAKA who developed iPS cells is also researching here.
Mission Statement
We think that enjoying science is the most important thing. Therefore, we always try to create an environment where we can tackle our projects as we discuss with each other and strengthen our unity in order to achieve our purpose. As a team of iGEM, we want more people to know synthetic biology, so we have done various things. Please watch human practice.
