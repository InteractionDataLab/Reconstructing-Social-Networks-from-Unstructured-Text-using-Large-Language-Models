GoldMedal
Highlight
This year's iGEM Kyoto carried out two main activities except Carnivores E.coli. Frist, we held a summer meeting of iGEM Japan. Second, we created an organization to help high school students who desire to join the iGEM world. These are very fruitful things and satisfy Gold Medal criteria. The detail is below
Help Another iGEM Team
iGEM Japan Meetup
We hosted iGEM Japan summer meeting at Kyoto University. Then, iGEM Japan teams could exchange profitable opinions. After the meeting, we had an party. This was a rare opportunity for iGEM Japan’s member to communicate and interact with each other that usually live in the distance.
New technical standard
We devised a new way to calculate RPU and the equation is expressed as follows. RPUφ = [mRNAφss]/[mRNA j23101 ss]. It is a lot of troubles to calculate RPU using GFP fluorescence , but this way we can save these troubles. Using our new method you can characterize the promoters' activities regulated by the substances which could be consumed by cells, while using the previous method, you can't
Human Practice
We conducted the final way to arose interest in students and give then appropriate knowledge based on their own experiences, introduce and attract them iGEM HS division. This is a new and powerful approach to make iGEM and synthetic biology more popular. In order to assist future iGEMer, we founded the department which is for iGEM HS division in September. Komatsu and Nobeyama became point man of this project, then we started to accept question about iGEM HS Division, synthetic biology, how to experiment, and so on
