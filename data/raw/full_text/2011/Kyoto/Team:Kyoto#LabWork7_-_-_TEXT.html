PCR amplification of SAM-P20 and ChiA
We performed colony direct PCRs from a S. albogriseolus colony and a S. avermitilis colony.

We prepared two kinds of templates:
Picked a colony, suspended in 50ul of water and incubated 1min at 95 degree. Added 1ul to the reaction mixture.
Picked a colony and dipped in the reaction mixture.
Gel electrophoresis indicated that the PCR amplifications were successful for a sample, ChiA, but it was a faint band. We decided to retry direct PCR of SAM-P20 and PCR of ChiA.
Saturday
Digestion(Kajita)
Retry of PCR amplification of SAM-P20 and ChiA.
We amplified SAM-P20 by colony direct PCR and ChiA by PCR using the PCR product that performed yesterday.
Reaction mixture: The same components and volume as before.
PCR condition: The same PCR condition as before.
PCR for SAM-P20
We prepared two kinds of templates:
Picked a colony, suspended in 50ul of TE buffer (pH8.0) and incubated 1min at 95 degrees. Added 5ul to the reaction mixture.
Picked a colony and dipped in the reaction mixture.
PCR for ChiA
1μl of PCR product was added to the reaction mixture as template.
Gel electrophoresis indicated that the PCR amplifications were successful for all samples. However, an unexpected faint band, about 1000bp, was also observed in the sample of ChiA.
PCR purification of SAM-P20 and gel extraction of ChiA.
SAM-P20: 43.9 ng/μl
ChiA: 30.0 ng/μl
Restriction enzyme digestion
We performed restriction digestions for:
SAM-P20 with EcoRI and SpeI
ChiA with EcoRI and SpeI
Incubated overnight at 37 degrees.

PCR amplification of BBa_R0011, lactose promoter
We done the amplification of lactose promoter. After that, we digested the product with DpnI, incubated 1 hour at 37 degrees.
Gel electrophoresis indicated that the PCR amplification was successful, but DpnI didn't work at all. So, we done the gel extraction.
