We got drosophila melanogaster(oregon-rs) in 3 tubes from Mr. Fuse .
We made standard medium of Tokyo Metropolitan Univ. for drosophila .
Standard medium of Tokyo Metropolitan Univ. for drosophila
Materials
Methods
water 500mL
dry yeast 20g
corn flour 45g
glucose 50g
agarose 3.5g
propionic acid 1.5mL
Stir dry yeast and agarose with about two-thirds of water. Then, autoclave it.
Stir corn flour and glucose with the remaining water.
Stir 1 and 2, then autoclave it again.
after autoclave, add propionic acid into it.■
We dispensed the standard-medium into 3 bottles.
Kusaba made a convenient tube for taking flies.

When we transfer flies to bottle No.4, we sadly found most of they drown. Then we wipe off the water drops inside the bottles and use dry heat sterilizer to dry them. The problem is solved and we dispense flies to No.5 and No.6, from No.4 and No.2 respectively.
An extra 0.3g agarose is added into the 100ml standard-medium to make the solid-medium. We clean the bottle No.4 and dispense the solid-medium into it and labeled No.7.
We practiced ice anesthesia.
Aug 6th, 2011
After drying lightly the bottle No.7, we transfer the flies from No.3 into it.
Aug 7th, 2011
We dispensed standard-medium to six bottles and solid-medium to another two bottles.
Aug 8th, 2011
Not enough flies to dispense.
The experimental plan was made by Kusaba.
Aug 9th, 2011
Transfer part of the flies from No.6 to No.8(standard-medium).
Supplement the standard-medium in No.1~3.
Aug 11th, 2011
Transfer flies from No.5 to No.9(standard-medium).
Aug 12th, 2011
Transfer the rest of the flies from No.6 to No.10(standard-medium).
Aug 17th, 2011
We transfer the second generation of flies as follows:
No.1 -> No.11
No.2 -> No.12
No.3 -> No.13
No.5 -> No.14
No.6 -> No.15
We dispose the imaginal flies of No.7.

Our group assembled the first experimental system to research the phototaxis of flies. However, the response of flies was not clear and we could not get respectable results.
Fly dispension:
No.12 -> No.14
No.3, 5, 6, 7 -> No.16
No.1, 2 -> No.17
We made the medium with a little change as follows:
agarose 3.5g -> 4.0g
Add "Bokinin" 5 ml(p-Hydroxybenzoate 0.5 g in 5 ml of 70% alcohol solution)
Aug 19th, 2011
Fly dispension:
No.11 -> No.18(second generation).
No.5, 6, 7 ->No.19
No.2, 3 ->No.20
No.1 -> refrigerator
No.8 -> No.9
