Judging Form
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2011 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleaic acid sequence
Description of function
Authorship
Safety notes, if relevant.
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry
Part Number(s):
iGEM Wiki Page Name: Team:Kyoto/Parts
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
Part Number(s):
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Page name: Team:Kyoto/Criteria/GoldMedal
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.

iGEM Prizes
Best Human Practice Advance
Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Best human practice:We conducted the final way to arose interest in students and give then appropriate knowledge based on their own experiences, introduce and attract them iGEM HS division. This is a new and powerful approach to make iGEM and synthetic biology more popular.  In order to assist future iGEMer, we founded the department which is for iGEM HS division in September. Komatsu and Nobeyama became point man of this project, then we started to accept question about iGEM HS Division, synthetic biology, how to experiment, and so on
Best Experimental Measurement: We devised a new way to calculate RPU and the equation is expressed as follows. RPUφ = [mRNAφss]/[mRNA j23101 ss]. It is a lot of troubles to calculate RPU using GFP fluorescence , but this way we can save these troubles. Using our new method you can characterize the promoters' activities regulated by the substances which could be consumed by cells, while using the previous method, you can't.
Team Parts
Three parts that we feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
