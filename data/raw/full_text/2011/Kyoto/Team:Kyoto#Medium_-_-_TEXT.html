Medium
Standard medium for drosophila
Stir dry yeast 20g and agarose 3.5~5.0g with about two-thirds of water 500mL. Then, autoclave it.
Stir corn flour 45g and glucose 50g with the remaining water.
Stir 1 and 2, then autoclave it again.
after autoclave, add propionic acid 1.5mL and 10 % p-hydroxybenzoate in 70 % Eternol 5mL into it.
Standard medium for drosophila
M9 medium
Stir Na2HPO4 6 g, KH2PO4 3 g, NaCl 0.5 g and NH4Cl 1 g with water 1 l.
After autoclave, add 10 ml filter sterilized 100 mM MgSO4, 20 % glucose, 10 mM CaCl2, 100 mM thiamine-HCl.
If you need, add 10 ml filter sterilized 20 % casamino acid.
LB medium
Stir Tryptone 20 g, Yeast extract 10 g and NaCl 10 g with water 200ml.
If you make LB plates, add agar 10 g.
Autoclave.
SOB medium
Stir Tryptone 20g and Yeast extract 5g with water.
Add 2 ml 5 M NaCl and 840 ul 3 M KCl and add water up to 1 l.
After autoclave, add 10 ml filter sterilized 1 M MgSO4 and 1 M MgCl2.
SOC medium
Add 2 M glucose 1 ml to 100 ml SOB.
Buffer TB
Stir PIPES and CaCl2・2H2O with 100 ml water.
