Method to lure insects
In nature, some of organisms which eat insects lure them. Rafflesia attract flies by distinctive smell. Pyrearinus termitilluminans, which makes and lives in tunnel in anthill of termite Cornitermes cumulans, emits light in the first week of rainy season to hunt the termites. Arachnocampa also uses light for hunting flies.
For Carnivorous E.coli, we chose light as the method to lure insects like Pyrearinus termitilluminans, because it is simple and there is an available biobrick which has the function to emit light: BBa_K3225909 created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team.
Our works
To probe that Carnivorous E.coli can lure insects. we, group luminescence, intend to do the following things.
Confirmation that drosophila, our model organism, have positive phototaxis in blue light (E.glowli created by 2010 Cambridge Team emits blue light)
Confirmation that drosophila moves to light emitted by E.coli
