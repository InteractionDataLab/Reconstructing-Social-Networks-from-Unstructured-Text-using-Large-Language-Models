Project
このページにはプロジェクトの概要を書いて詳細はリンク先に書くことを提案します。
それと各プロジェクトの名前はもう少し検討してもいいと思うのです。hunger→nutrient switchとかluminescenceも誤解を招く表現に思われます。
Overview
Escherichia coli is generally not regarded as an animal because they don't hunt or eat. Thus, the creation of carnivorous E.coli which catches and digests bugs like other animals challenges this notion. Fries are baited, caught and digested, becoming a supplementary ammoniacal source when the media doesn't contain enough gultamine. The project consists of 4 minor projects.
求訂正。論文用の書き出しなのでwikiではもっと詳しくしないといけない。そもそも実験がすべてうまくいった前提で書いてあることに注意。

ここでは各プロジェクトのページに飛ぶリンクだけをはる予定なので、簡単な説明はhomeへ、より詳しい説明は各プロジェクトのページに記載するようにお願いします。by Kato
Team Hunger
Nutritional switch is constructed by the genes from glnA operon.

We demonstrated the strong phototaxis to ultraviolet and weaker phototaxis to lights of other wavelength.
Introduction made by 草場  ※要添削
In nature, some of organisms which eat insects lure them. Rafflesia attract flies by distinctive smell. Pyrearinus termitilluminans, which makes and lives in tunnel in anthill of termite Cornitermes cumulans, emits light in the first week of rainy season to hunt the termites. Arachnocampa also uses light for hunting flies. For Carnivorous E.coli, we chose light as the method to lure insects like Pyrearinus termitilluminans, because it is simple and there is an available biobrick which has the function to emit light: BBa_K3225909 created by iGEM 2010 Cambridge Team.
To probe that Carnivorous E.coli can lure insects. we, group luminescence, intend to do the following things.
Confirmation that drosophila, our model organism, have positive phototaxis in blue light (E.glowli created by 2010 Cambridge Team emits blue light)
Confirmation that drosophila moves to light emitted by E.coli

Team Digestion
Chitin, the main component of exoskeleton of fry is degraded by ChitinaseA1 and protein which composes the body is degraded by SAM-P20, serine protease. The exocrine of ChitinaseA1 and SAM-P20 was measured both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Our goal is following two things
Quantitative and qualitative Measurement of ChiA1 and SAM-P20
目標:大腸菌から消化酵素（プロテアーゼ、キチナーゼ）を分泌させ、実際にハエを溶かす。
