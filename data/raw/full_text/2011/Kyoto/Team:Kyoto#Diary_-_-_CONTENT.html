A lot of students participated in our lecture and they seemed to get interested in biochemistry and iGEM. Their pure curiosity reminded us of our past high school days and we re-realized the interests of science. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="week"><B>Thursday</B><P>Team Capture started breeding flies. The flies(Drosophila Melanogaster) were provided by Professor Fuse. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="week"><B>Sturday</B><P>One of the biggest fire festivals in Japan was held in Osaka, south of Kyoto. Fire festivals are the seasonal tradition in summer in our country. We enjoyed the beautiful theater on the night sky.

August 9, 1945, a atmic bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki. And 2011, Japan again has a problem of nuclear. However, the situation is completely different from 76years ago, because now we have a lot of friends all over the world!
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Week3:_Monday_15th_-_Sunday_21th_August"> Week3: Monday 15th - Sunday 21th August </SPAN></H2><B>Tuesday</B><P>Today, August 16, is a very important day for the people living in Kyoto, because the historical fire festival called 'Gozan-no-Okuribi' is held. The original purpose of this festival is to pray for the deceased. Just five months ago, about 20,000 people died in the devastating earthquake and tunami. And so many people are still struggling to live in the affected area. Moreover, the situation of Fukushima is also totally unresolved. This disaster robbed us of a lot of precious memories, lovers, and peaceful daily lives. However, at the same time, it reminded us of the importance of the bonding with friends or families, and also gave us the good opportunity to rethink about nuclear power plants. Now, all we can do is to do our best for the recovery.
We would like express our heartfelt gratitude to all countries which gave helps to Japan, and would like to pray silently for the victims.
</P><DIV class="week"><B>Wednesday</B><P>Rakunan high school is the second place we visited for the lecture of Human Practice. The number of the participants were small compared with the first lecture at Todaiji-Gakuen, but the students listened hard to our lecture.
</P></DIV><DIV class="week"><B>Thursday</B><P>Team Capture assembled the first experimental system to research the phototaxis of flies. 
However, the response of flies against LEDs was not clear and we could not get respectable results. It seems that we have to improve the way to experiment.

Today, an important meeting of iGEM Japan was held at Kyoto University. Members of iGEM Japan got together at Kyoto from Osaka and Tokyo! The participating universities were the University of Tokyo, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Osaka University, and us, Kyoto University. Each participants made presentation on the progress of their projects, and discussed each others very animatedly. We learned a lot from talking with each other. <P>
After the presentation, we enjoyed a dinner party! During this party, we forgot the fatigue of researching and felt refreshed. Let's go MIT together!  
</P></DIV><DIV class="week"><B>Tuesday</B><P>The weekly meeting. Reviewing the presentations made by other iGEM teams yesterday, we discussed the incoming plan of experiment.
</P></DIV><DIV class="week"><B>Wednesday</B><P>Kusaba, leader of team Capture, is looking for some good references about phototaxis of Drosophila and insects.

Flies were not active enough in the last experiment, so we decided to use the young flies 3 or 4 days old.
On 18:30, the weekly meeting started. After we verified progress situation of each groups, discussed about the wiki editing.

This morning, adviser Kashima conducted a lecture about RT-PCR for the beginners. Team iGEM Kyoto 2011 is consisting mainly of sophomores and freshmen, so these lectures are very helpful and absolutely necessary for us. Thank you, Kashima-san(Mr.Kashima)!
