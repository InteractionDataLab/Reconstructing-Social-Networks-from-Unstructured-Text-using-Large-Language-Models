Appreciations for helpers in experiments
Naoyuki Fuse, a gCOE Research Fellow of Kyoto University advised us how to breed drosophila appropriately. Kaze Ueda and Takasi Watanabe, professors of Faculty of agriculture, Kyoto University and Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, respectively, told us about DNS assay. Without their help, we would be at a loss. Thank you very much !
