In recent years, with growing social impact, HUST has enrolled more high quality students. HUST graduates have been enjoying popularity among employers in the job market, and the employment rate has reached above 95%.</DIV><DIV style="font-size:5" style="float:left">
During the construction of “211 Project” and “985 Project”, HUST has broken traditional discipline boundaries, integrated multi-disciplinary resources, played an active role in developing the national innovation system, built the high level and cross-disciplinary scientific innovation platform, and the innovation base of philosophy and social science. Meanwhile, all the 11 innovation platforms are under full development, including Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, the base of digital manufacturing of equipment and technology, the base of gravitation research, the base of transplantation medicine, the base of environment and health, the base of national defense science and technology, as well as the philosophy and social science base featured with “scientific development and humanism”.

In accordance with the policy strengthening a coordinated development of both basic research and applied research, HUST founded a three-level vertical system of scientific and technological innovation, including a basic research level with national &amp; provincial laboratories as its core, a hi-tech research level with the national engineering research center as its leader, and a technological development level with the national technology transfer center and the joint laboratory as its pillar.

Nowadays, the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, supported by HUST, is now under full construction. Meanwhile, the pulsed high magnetic field facility, which is a major science and technology infrastructure project, has been approved. Besides, the University has four national key laboratories, two national specialized laboratories, one key national defense laboratory, one national engineering laboratory, thirty-seven provincial key laboratories, three key laboratories of the Ministry of Education (Level B), six national engineering(technology) research centers, eight provincial(technology) research centers, three cooperative research centers of the Ministry of Education and four provincial humanities and social science research bases. 

In recent years, the university receives increasing research funds, and its number of publications accepted in SCI, EI, ISTP was among the top ten universities in China. 

Sticking to the principle of “Securing Support through Service, Pursuing Development by Contribution”, HUST actively promotes commercialization of technological achievements, expands the coverage of education and in return enjoys satisfactory social and economic benefits. 

By establishing cooperative ties with other provinces including Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, HUST has strengthened its collaboration with the local government and large corporations. And HUST has been making contribution to the regional economic development through the establishment of research institutes and industrialization base and the promotion of scientific cooperation. Now it has become one of the seven national technology transfer centers.</DIV><DIV style="font-size:5" style="float:right">
Focusing on combining learning and research with manufacturing and considering technology innovation and promotion as its task, HUST has established a group of advanced science and technology enterprises with “HUAGONG TECH CO., LTD” as a gleaming example. The University Science Park becomes the national “863” industrialization base, and the University science and technology enterprise incubator is honored as the “National Hi-Tech Innovation Service Center”. The “four step jump” pattern for science and technology incubation and industrialization has won acclaim from other universities across the country. National leaders, such as Hu Jintao, Li Changchun, spoke highly of the university’s achievements in hi-tech industry during their visit to HUST.
