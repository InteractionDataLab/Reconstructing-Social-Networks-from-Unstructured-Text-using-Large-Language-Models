The existing models of SEA software
      This model is Idea Cloud, which provides customers brianstorm support.When a project has not yet formed an idea, it is inefficient to find idea without purpose.       What is more, the results of the idea would be tendentious and uneffective.       Our Idea Cloud model is based on summarizing most ideas that former teams concluded. After reorganizing, refining, we conclude these strong functional elements, which can provide outstanding effects to people who are looking for an excellent idea.
Idea Cloud
      Our Idea Cloud has a vairiety of functional elements, spining and rotating around. Once clicking on a element you are interested in，elements that are related to that particular element will gather around the element you are interested in.       The reason why it is called Cloud is that we have considered all the relationships betweeen each elements, which are linear instead of reticular.       Through our rotate idea cloud, we could only only gain deep understanding of former teams' ideas, but also could combine and intergrate all the functional elements during designing our process, resulting a brand new idea.       Tools required: Flash, Papervision 3D, Php, My SQL
Metabolic Pathway Search
      Metabolic pathway search this model is formed based on Escherichia coli str, K-12 those relative basic metabolic pathway database.  This model supports the following functions:       Entering two of the  random colon cbacillus'results from metabolic pathway, the software will compute the optimalizing pathway for the best response parameter, including enzyme and other information.
