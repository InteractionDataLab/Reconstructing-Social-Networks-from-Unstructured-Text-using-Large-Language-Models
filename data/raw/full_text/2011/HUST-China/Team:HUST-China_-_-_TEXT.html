Welcome
   Wuhan, composed of the three towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, is the capital of Hubei Province. Two bridges link the three towns, separated by the Yangzi River and Hanshui River, and because these municipalities are so closely connected by waterways, Wuhan is also called the "city on rivers."
   In addition, being regarded as A Thoroughfare to Nine Provinces, Wuhan is the most significant water hub and rail transportation and communication of China. Today, Wuhan has been the political, economic, and cultural center of Central China.
Introduction to SEA project
   Super E.coli Architect (SEA) is a kind of design software for engineering bacteria and offers a convenient and efficient design platform, having capability to integrate scattered simple ideas into a complete solution.
   However, most existing synthetic biology softwares involve merely such specific functions as finding genes, metabolism pathways, and biobrick design, and it is just because of the intense specificity of those softwares that they are limited only to scientific researchers.
    In order to make synthetic biology softwares more available to common designers who would like to do jobs on synthetic biology but might be not so familiar with it as scientists do, we are determined to alter the science of artificial biosystem into an engineering program with the standard process.
   At the thought above, we constructed the software, SEA, for not only scientists but also common designers.
   Fortunately, it has been proved that the SEA we have developed is able to release designers from technical details by helping them work as specific architects and allowing them to take more attention to constructing engineering bacteria to solve practical problems.
