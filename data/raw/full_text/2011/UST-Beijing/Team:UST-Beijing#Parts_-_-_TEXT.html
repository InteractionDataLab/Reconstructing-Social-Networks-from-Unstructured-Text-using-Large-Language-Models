PR, an abbreviation for proteorhodopsin, is a transmembrane protein which was discovered in 2000 through shortgun genome sequencing of unculturable bacteria isolated from the seawater off the coast of California. PR is a light-activated proton pump and generates a pmf which is short for proton motive force. This part, K603000 designed by Danyang Wang, was constructed as below: We replaced the PR's precusor sequence with the leader peptide of human cytochrome oxidase subunit 4 isoform 1, targeting it to mitochondrial inner membrane.  Meanwhile, all the codons were re-designed according to codon usage bias for Homo sapiens.
