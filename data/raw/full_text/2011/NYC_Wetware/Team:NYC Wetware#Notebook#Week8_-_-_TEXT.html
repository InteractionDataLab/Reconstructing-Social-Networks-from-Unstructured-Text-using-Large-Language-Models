Remaining unisolated amplified E. coli genes re-run in small-scale gel. Looks good. Will try to harvest large sample for bricking next week.
Early results on plasmid ligation products (BIOBRICKS) look spotty. Investigating...
Ran gel on the final 10 E. coli genes that still needed extraction. Separation and use of transilluminator successful. Extracted bands of interest.  Ran colony PCR to test out our new D. rad primers.
Yesterday's D. rad colony PCR FAILED. Re-runs with extracted DNA from early-summer trials and with higher concentration of colonies. Re-runs FAIL too.
Extracted DNA from yesterdays gels and ligated them into plasmid for transformation.
