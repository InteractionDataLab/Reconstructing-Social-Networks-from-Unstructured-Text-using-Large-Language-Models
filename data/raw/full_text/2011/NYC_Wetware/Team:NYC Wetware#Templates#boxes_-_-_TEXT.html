Abstract
We studied genes responsible for radiation resistance in Deinococcus and E. coli. Our approach was to use both genome sequencing and molecular biology experiments. We were able to get at our answer by using RNA-seq to study the genetic correlations of species' radiation responses and by cloning genes from the literature.
Team Philosophy
Our diverse team is based at Weill Cornell Medical College, but consists of undergraduates from a wide variety of New York City universities.
