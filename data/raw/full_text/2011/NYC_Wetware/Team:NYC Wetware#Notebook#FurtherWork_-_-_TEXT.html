Successfully transformed and inoculated TS. But was unsuccessful with TR.
Did a E/S digest of the 5 E. coli inserts that had been sequenced and verified.  Gel extracted the digest of the insert. Nanodropped the extract.
Acquired expression vectors with K resistance and digested them with E/X, a compatible cut.
Grew up cells that had been transformed earlier with the 5 E. coli storage plasmids. Miniprepped the cells. Digested them with E/S.
Ligated the inserts and vectors.
Received TS, TR E. coli from Dr. Domann and Fitzgerald of the University of Utah. Sent them to Penn State for testing. Received results from Penn State, which are recorded in the Partners/Penn State page.
