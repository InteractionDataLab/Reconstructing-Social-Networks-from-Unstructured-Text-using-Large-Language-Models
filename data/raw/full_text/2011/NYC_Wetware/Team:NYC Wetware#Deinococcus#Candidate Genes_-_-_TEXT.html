Omelchenko et al., 2005
Catalases
predicted catalses
DR_1998, DR_A0259, DR_A 0146
Hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen
Catalase is important next enzyme after SOD. If not present, H2O2 accumulate and have deleterious effect
Omelchenko et al., 2005
Thioredoxin
DR_0994

Important for defense against oxidative stress
Obiero et al., 2010  :Journal of Bacteriology, January 2010, p. 494-501, Vol. 192, No. 2

Mutant shows general repair deficiency
Blasius
RecF
PolA
DR_1707

important role in ESDSA DSB repair pathway, modulated by Mn(II) - Important effect
Blasius
PolX
DR_0467

Proteolytic subunit of ATP-dependent Clp protease
Blasius
ClpX
DR_1973
ATP-binding subunit of ATP-dependent Clp protease
Blasius
CrtB
DR_0862
Phytoene synthase
Carotenoids have antioxidant properties, are located at the cell\'s 1st line of defense- the cell wall/membrane. Also they may be able to \"take the hit\" of ionizing radiation, thus protecting cytosolic components
Blasius
Zhang et al., 2007 (Arch Microbilogy)
CrtI
DR_0861
Phytoene desaturase
KO of carotenoid synthesis genes DR0861 and DR0862 resulted in increased sensitivity to oxidants, ionizing radiation and UV
Blasius
Zhang et al., 2007 (Arch Microbilogy)
Crtlm
DR_0801
Carotenoid synthesis
These genes boxed off are in the biosynthesis pathway for deinoxathin, the major carotenoid pigment in D. rad. It also has antioxidant properties
Tian & Hua., 2010
CrtO
DR_0093
Carotenoid synthesis
CruF
DR_0091
Carotenoid synthesis
CrtD
DR_2250
Carotenoid synthesis
OxyR
DR_0615
Oxidative stress resistance
little connection to IR resistance. MntH expresison is also downregulated by this regulon (which is contrary to what we would like to see)
Nevermind. This protein was expressed in E. coli before and was not able to complement an E coli OxyR KO. It presumably does not bind the E coli polymerase
OxyR2
DR_A0336
Oxidative stress resistance
Novel OxyR enzyme- this means D. rad has multiple OxyRs!!!
Yin et al., 2010 (Jornal of Microbiology)
deiNOS
deinococcus nitric oxide synthase
DR_2597
Nitirc oxide production
KO causes increase in susceptibility to UV irradiation.  Slower recover following insult
Patel et al., 2009., Adak et al, 2002
ObgE
?
GTPase that regulates cel growth/proliferation
decreased ObgE afte NOS KO implicated as an important mediator of growth recovery following UV insult
Patel et al., 2009.,
Hypothetical protein
DR_A0282
nucleotide binding protein??- perhaps DNA repair
mutant had 10X less survival to 14Gy gamma. Enzyme also is manganese dependent!!!
Das & Misra., 2011
predicted ATP-dependent ABC-type transporter (Mn (II))
DR_2284 DR_2523
Mn (II) transport
possibly maintain intracellular Mn(II) ratio.
