Received licenses sponsorship for all the team members for the software Geneious. Designed primers for all our E. coli genes of interest. Placed order before 3:00pm from IDT. Should be in by tomorrow. Acquired transilluminator. Ordered flat end tweezers. Working on nitrocellulose extraction protocol; getting clear bands and bonding to paper.
Attempted to successfully extract a PCR product using a nitrocellulose paper extraction method. After running on a gel, nitrocellulose paper was placed in front of the band of interest and then run onto the paper. Nanodrop results to come.
Extracted RNA from the first round of synchrotron'ed D. rad. Hope we got stuff; RNA is notoriously difficult to isolate.
Repeated DNA isolation of amplified RFP gene by nitrocellulose extraction. As of now, ethanol precipitation doesn't seem to have worked. Will store overnight and hope we see a pellet in the morning.
Prepared first antibiotic aliquots for making the LB broth; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and Kanamycin. Also, ampicillin and chloramphenicol don't dissolve too well...
Nanodrop results show the ethanol precipitation from the nitrocellulose extraction did not isolate any DNA :(   Received E. coli primers for all our E. coli genes of interest. Prepared the primers for stock and working concentrations. Tested PCR on E. coli with recG primer. Multiple products showed up on the gel.
