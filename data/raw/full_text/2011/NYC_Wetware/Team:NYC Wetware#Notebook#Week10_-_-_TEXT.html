Looking to clone RBS into plasmid pSB1A10 which contain RFP. Transformed pSB1A10 from initial distribution.
Successful transformation with multiple red colonies. Inoculated pSB1A10.
Miniprepped pSB1A10. Digested and ligated RBS's B0030 and B0034 into pSB1A10. Looking to transform tomorrow.
Transformed new screening plasmid, pSB1A10, with the RBSs ligated. Transformed two T. cruzi radioresistance genes. Hopefully, the same radioresistance that the plant enjoys can be conferred on E. coli through biobricks.
Ran PCR and gel to verify E. coli biobrick transformants. Verification primers amplify gene insertion plus ~100 bp in either direction. Samples whose lengths match expected sizes are sent for Sager sequencing.
