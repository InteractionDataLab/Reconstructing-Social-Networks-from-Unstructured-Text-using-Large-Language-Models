PCR test to see if all of our 27 E. coli primers are working. Most seem pretty good.
Successfully extracted our first 17 E. coli genes for biobricking from all the E. coli PCR reactions that yielded a single product band. Nanodrop results confirm DNA extracted. The PCR reactions with multiple product bands were rerun on a gel and the gene product of interest was excised on our new transilluminator.
Inserted our 17 successfully extracted genes of interest into plasmid pSB1C3. Lengthy, tricky process. Will be running gel to confirm we've made well-formed biobricks. Then, on to transformation!
10 Remaining unisolated E. coli genes ran in gel, but it was thoroughly incomprehensible. WIll try again.
