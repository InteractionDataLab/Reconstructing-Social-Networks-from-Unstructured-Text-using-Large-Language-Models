The picture below shows the process we used to piece together our design:
The blue F2620 part is our promoter. It detects the presence of P. aeruginosa by its quorum sensing factors.
The green E0840 part is our reporter. It is the gene for the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).
The blank ring is our plasmid that holds the assembly. Its part name is pSB1T3. It uses tetracyclene for its antibiotic selection.
