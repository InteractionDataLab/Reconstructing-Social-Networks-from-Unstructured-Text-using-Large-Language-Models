Training
E1010 samples where cultured overnight. There were 4 samples in all. 2 cultures were started from colony 1 while 1 culture each was started from colony 2 and 3
The overnight cultures were mini-prepped using a QIAprep Spin Mini prep Kit Concentratons were determined by Nano-drop (noted below) and placed on ice fo down stream applications.
Sample Concentrations
33.7 ng/uL
39.5 ng/uL
38.8 ng/uL
39.3 ng/uL
Samples were then digested with EcoRI and PstI to confirm E1010 was successfully obtained.  Samples were digested at 37C for 1 hour and heat inactivated at 80C for 20 minutes.
500ng of DNA was digested
Digests were then ligated with T4 Ligase at RT overnight.
