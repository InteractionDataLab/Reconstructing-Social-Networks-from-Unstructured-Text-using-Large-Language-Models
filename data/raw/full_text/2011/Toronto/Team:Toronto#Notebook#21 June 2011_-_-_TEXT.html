Magnetite Partial Oxidation Reaction Ratios: ratio R:  [FeSO4] / [NaOH]
Concentration Ratios NaOH (1 M) FeSO4 . 7H20 (g) 0.4 20 ml 2.22 g 0.45 20 ml 2.50 g 0.5 20 ml 2.78 g 0.55 20 ml 3.06 g
Determine highest yield of magnetite from varying ratios of R, where R = [FeSO4.7H2O] / [NaOH]
at a constant reaction temperature of 37 oC
It is hypothesized that the highest yield will result from an initial R value of 0.5 (as documented by Olowe A. et al, 1991)
Procedure:
4 (125 ml) flasks were filled with 82 ml dH2O and brought to a reaction temperature of 37 oC
FeSO4.7H20 (melanterite) was weighed for each respective ratio during dH20 heating
melanterite was added to dH20 at 36 oC and allowed to dissolve
Added room temperature NaOH
Start time of 2:09 pm, shaken at: 2:30pm, 2:58 pm, stopped at: 3:10 pm
removed after 1 hr.: dark teal precipitate and some black precipitate visible
let reaction mixture sit overnight at room temperature until 1:33 pm the next day, more black precipitate visible
