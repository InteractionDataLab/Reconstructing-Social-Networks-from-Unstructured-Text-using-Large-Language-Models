Magnetotactic Bacteria are organisms that use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate. They do this by creating perfectly shaped nanoparticles made of magnetite. These nanoparticles are difficult to synthesize in laboratory settings, and magnetotactic bacteria are also very difficult to grow. This year, we are focusing on incorporating a biomineralization pathway for magnetite in E.Coli, and creating a method of novel gene expression using magnetic fields.
