Welcome to the Missouri Miners Wiki page!
The Team of 2011
We are the Missouri Miners from Missouri University of Science and Technology.  Our team formed in 2007 and we've been working hard developing iGEM projects ever since.  In the beginning, the team only had a handful of people but, recently, we have grown to 30 hardworking members.
Our team is a student organization at S&T and we have been working hard to establish ourselves among the other well known student groups.   We are also working towards becoming S&T's newest Student Design Team.  Being at a science and technology university, Design Teams have a strong tradition on our campus and are highly respected.   We hope to bring a new design aspect to our school and promote the usefulness of synthetic biology.
We are very excited to participate in the iGEM 2011 Jamboree!
