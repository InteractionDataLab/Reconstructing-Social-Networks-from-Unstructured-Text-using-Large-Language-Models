Please use this page to answer the safety questions posed on the safety page .
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
o Researcher Safety?
• Our project has not raised issues of researcher safety outside of our use of commonly utilized bacteria and     carcinogens.  Each member of the team has been previously taught the proper way to handle these in a class-lab setting.
o Public Safety?
• No harmful product of our research, be those hazardous materials, transformed bacteria, or from our finished project, should reach the public, as we are following the proper safety protocols with respect to handling hazardous chemicals and bacteria, and our finished product is a protein that, if introduced into a solution, could be easily retrieved.
o Environmental Safety?
• So long as the metal-binding protein of interest can be bound to a filter without also binding some of the transformed E. coli, environmental safety should not be an issue.  This separation of protein and bacteria can be achieved by rounds of centrifugation.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
• We have yet to complete a BioBrick part, so at this point I cannot say.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
• Our members have been instructed on the proper ways to dispose of hazardous waste according to our local guidelines.  We are also not engineering bacteria in any potentially hazardous ways other than through the use of well-characterized plasmids that confer antibiotic resistance.  We have a work area set aside for such work that we keep sterile, and are careful to dispose of transformed bacteria in the proper biohazard waste.
