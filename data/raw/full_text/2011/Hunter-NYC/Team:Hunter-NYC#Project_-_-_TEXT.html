This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this is the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)

Overall project
We have designed a fusion protein consisting of a domain that binds strongly to zinc, cobalt and cadmium and the  C-terminus of the Pseudomonas sp. lipase (PML), which acts as a secretion tag for E. coli cells containing the lipBCD  genes from S. marcescens.  We would like our system to be as sustainable and low-cost as possible so that it, or an  improved version of it, would be practical and applicable in developing nations where contaminated water supplies are  especially problematic.  We hope that using a protein secretion system will help us achieve that goal by providing us  with an easy, low energy means to purify the metal filtering fusion protein.  In this scheme, the same population of E.  coli can be used to produce our protein multiple times since the protein would accumulate in the growth media and not  within the cells, in which case we would need to lyse the E. coli in order to prepare each filter.
