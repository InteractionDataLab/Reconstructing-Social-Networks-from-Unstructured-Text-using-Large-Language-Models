Complete Project Summary form
Team Wiki
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Par t or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
Silver
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or  Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Gold
Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry).
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We helped the Wagingen iGEM team by sending them a stock of the TOP10 strain.
We helped the Paris iGEM team by sending them the following strains:
-IIA-gfp   PspoIIA-gfp Cmr                       (Veening et al 2005)  -IIA/sad67 PspoIIA-gfp Cmr amyE::Pspac-sad67 Tcr (Veening et al 2005)  -IA/sinR   PspoIIA-gfp Cmr sinR::Sp Spr          (Veening et al 2006)  -IDJ011                    amyE::Pspank-kinA Sp  (De Jong et al 2011)
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing , and innovation.
