Data For Our Favorite New Parts
Main Page - Prm_cI-DAS_antiPlasB with 1.0RBS, BBa_K607018: An auto-inducing loop driven by cI-DAS that shows bimodal behavior without induction. Member of the cI autoinducing loop family
Main Page - Prm_cI-LVA_antiPlasB with 1.0RBS, BBa_K607013: An auto-inducing loop driven by cI-LVA that is turned off when not induced. This part is a good candidate for a robust bistable switch. Member of the cI autoinducing loop family
Main Page - Prm_cI_antiPlasB with 1.0RBS, BBa_K607022: An auto-inducing loop driven by cI showing bimodal behavior if uninduced. Member of the cI autoinducing loop family
Data For Pre-existing Parts
Experience - pBAD/araC, a promoter induced by arabinose, BBa_I0500 (Sri Kosuri 2003) We were able to measure promoter activity with various arabinose concentrations over time which has given us insight into the dynamics of the activation of the promoter.
Experience - cI inducible promoter Prm, BBa_I12006 (Caltech 2004): We induced the Prm promoter indirectly with cI produced by the protein generator BBa_K607001 controlled by pBAD BBa_I0500 which enabled us to estimate the activation rate of the transcription factor.
Experience - hybB Cold Shock Promoter, BBa_J45503: We were able to show that this promoter does not work as expected. This is an important result as this part was really popular among the teams.
We've Also Characterized the Following Parts
In addition to our favorite parts we also created a collection of autoinducing loops with different behavior. Have a look at the lambda cI autoinducing loop family and the LasR autoinducing loop family
