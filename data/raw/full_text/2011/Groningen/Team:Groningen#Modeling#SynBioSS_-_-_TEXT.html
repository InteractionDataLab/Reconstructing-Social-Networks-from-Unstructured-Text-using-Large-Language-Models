Team:Groningen/Modeling/SynBioSS
From 2011.igem.org
SynBioSS features a gui implemted in python and can interface with most mayor other modeling frameworks such as SBML, Hy3S as NetCDF. It does not have a good visualisation interface and suggest you load your results into matlab for examination. SynBioSS also includes a supercomputer Message Passing Interface implementation which is nice if you want to go all out on some sort of cluster achitecture. Unfortunately SynBioSS is instable, does not support 64 bit achitectures and nobody has worked on it since 2010. So for us this is not an option. SynBioSS can be found at [1]
