name: Vessa
country: Indonesia
study: Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (Biomolecular Sciences)
I like laughing out loud till my cheeks are getting tired
I don't like my twin-chubby cheeks
When I was 10, I wanted to become a famous classical pianist
I cannot live without chocolate and cheese
I would like to (be able to) think one think at a time
My favourite color: any mixed bright colors
My favourite farytale: The little mermaid
My favourite drink is fresh milk and fruit yoghurt, because they don't turn my face into red!
Before I die, I want to swim in Niagara Falls xD
When I'm bored, I daydream :)
If I would be a superhero, my power would be tireless stamina (endurance)
People, who don't like me, say I'm bossy
People, who like me, say I'm too neat, too polite, too nice, too naive
If I win the lottery, I will swim in the money I won! YAY! \(^O^)/
