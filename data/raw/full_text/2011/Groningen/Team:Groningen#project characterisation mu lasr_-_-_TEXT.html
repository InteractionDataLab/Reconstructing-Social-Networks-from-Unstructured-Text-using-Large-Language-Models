LasR autoinducing loop family
Our second memory unit consists of a LasR gene(Bba_C0179) driven the LasB promoter(Bba_R0079). LasR only activates transcription in the presence of HSL, this was added to the medium in a concentration of 100nM.
Leakage of the LasR autoinducing loops
To estimate the autoactivation of the LasR loop through a leaky promoter we measured fluorescence of cells carrying an pSB1K3 plasmid with the autoinducing loop biobrick (different variants) and the plasmid pSB1A3 with an input(PLacI controlling LasR) as well as the output (PlasB controlling RFP-LVA). The measurements were done in a presence of 100nM PAI.
