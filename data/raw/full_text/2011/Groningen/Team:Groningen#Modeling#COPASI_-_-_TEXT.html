From 2011.igem.org
A rather comprehensive modeling package but without any visualization options. It offers extensive modeling and analysis support but nothing in the way of plotting functions or graphs. Although it would be nice to be able to use partial differential equations, its confinement to ODE´s is not a big issui.
