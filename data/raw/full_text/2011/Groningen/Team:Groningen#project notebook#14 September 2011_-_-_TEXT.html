Olesja
measurement of leakage of LasR autoinducing loops (with 100 nM HSL)
measurement over time with flow cytometry (0 - 8 h)
measurement
Joyce
Plasmid prep of other colonies of PBAD-cI-LVA-DT and PBAD-LasR-LVA-DT
After prep checking on the nanodrop: concentration was low, because it was eluted in higher volume.
Samples were put in the vaquum centrifuge at 60 °C for 20 minutes.
Samples were measured again with nanodrop: plots looked nicer and DNA concentration was higher, up to 60 μg/μl
Transformation of yesterday with all the plates did go well, 25 of the 28 samples show colonies on the plate
Prepared 100 tubes with LB+ Chloramphenicol and inoculated them, since we need 4 of each sample for plasmid prepping tomorrow
15:15: hurrying, because tonight the choir song will be recorded with professional recording stuff!
Getting software for adapting the record and the film synchronized, finished at 11:00
