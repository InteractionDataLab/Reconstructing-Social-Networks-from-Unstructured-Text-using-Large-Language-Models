Fluorimetry
Fluorimetry protocol
M9 minimal media
The OD600 and fluorescence of a great number of samples can be measured at the same time with a fluorimeter.
We used it for measuring pBAD/araC-cI-LVA+pcI-GFP with different concentrations of arabinose as an induction
signal.
Fluorimetry protocol
Inoculate 10ml M9 medium+ antibiotics + 1ml 2% casamino acids and grow the cultures overnight at 37°C.
Grow a logfase to an OD600 of 0.4.
Dilute in a way that the OD600 is decreased to a value of 0.004
Add 300μl of the diluted culture into a well.
The fluorimeter will measure the OD600+ fluorescence every 15 minutes.
Fluorimeter used for measurements: infinite F200 TECAN. Serial no. : 811005514.

M9 minimal media
Component Concentrations
1x M9 salts
2mM MgSO4
0.1mM CaCl2
0.4% carbon source (e.g. glycerol, glucose, etc.)
In sterile H2O
Protocol
For 1L of media
500ml 2xM9 salts
20ml 0.1M MgSO4
200μl 0.5M CaCl2
469.8ml sterile deionized H2O
Combine above solutions using sterile technique. (May notice some precipitation during preparation but precipitate
should go back into solution once volume is brought up to 1l with sterile H2O.)
Add antibiotics as appropriate and store at 4°C
