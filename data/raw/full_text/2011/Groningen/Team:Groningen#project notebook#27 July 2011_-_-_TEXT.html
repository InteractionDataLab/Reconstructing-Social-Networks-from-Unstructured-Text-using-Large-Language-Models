Main Goal
Part quality control by PCR and sequencing
To Do List
Transform:
Constitutive promoter[ Pc ]
Kanamycine resistance cassete[ KanR ]
P(CI)+RBS+GFP --> competence cells quality control
Joyce
Sequencing results of LasR-LVA-DT colony 6 are good:)
Plasmid Prep of PBAD-LasR-LVA-DT and PhybB-LasR-LVA-DT
DNA concentrations:
Samples were send for sequencing and a glycerol stock has been made.
Making competent cells according to this protocol:
Materials to be supplied by the user
• 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (sterile, dry, 4 °C, min. 200 pieces)
• 50 ml plastic centrifuge tubes (sterile, pre-cooled, 8 pieces)
• cuvettes
• 2 L flask (sterile, 2 flasks)-preferably Erlenmeyers
• stove, 37 °C
• TY broth (sterile, 5 ml)
• 2xTY broth (sterile, 37 °C, 500 ml)
• TY agar plate
• E. coli strain from glycerol stock
• Buffer RF1 (ice cold)
• Buffer RF2
• ice
• liquid nitrogen
Buffer RF1 500mls
Rubidium chloride 6.00 g
Potassium acetate 2.45 g
Calcium chloride 2H20 0.75 g
Glycerol 75.00 g
Adjust to pH 5.8 using 0.2 M Acetic acid
Sterilise by filtration
Buffer RF2 300mls
0.5 M MOPS PH 6.8 6.00 ml (Use 4 M NaOH to pH MOPS)
Rubidium chloride 0.36 g
Calcium chloride 2H20 3.30 g
Glycerol 45.00 g
Adjust to pH 6.8 with 1M NaOH
Sterilise by filtration
Protocol
Day 1
1. Streak out E. coli strain, direct from a glycerol stock 24 hours before you intend to put up an overnight culture.
2. Autoclave 200 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and ensure they are dry before use. (Leave the dry tubes at 4 °C so they are pre-cooled before use.)
Day 2
1. ~5pm day before growing cultures, inoculate 5 ml 2xTY with a freshly grown colony. Grow O/N at 37 °C.
2. It is a good idea to put 2x 2 litre sterile flasks & 500 ml sterile 2xTY at 37 °C overnight – this will create continuity of temperature when you inoculate your 2x 200 ml cultures the next morning.
Day 3
1. Add 200 ml pre-warmed 2xTY into a 2 litre flask. Inoculate with 2 ml (1/100 dilution) of the overnight culture. Grow 2x 200 ml cultures at the same time. Grow cultures to an OD600nm of between 0.3-0.4.This should take a maximum of 2 hours.
2. Put 8x 50 ml plastic centrifuge tubes in ice to pre-cool. Make sure your centrifuge has been pre-run to bring down the temperature to 4 °C.
3. Collect culture into 8 x 50ml pre-cooled centrifuge tubes. Leave on ice for 15 minutes.
4. Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 2700 rpm for 15 minutes 4 °C.
5. Remove the supernatant. Drain residue supernatant from the cell pellets. Do this by turning the tubes upside down on paper towels. Remove the supernatant left on the tube lip and inside wall using tissue. Put the tubes back on ice.
6. Resuspend cell pellets by adding 16 ml of ice cold RF1 to each pellet and vortexing gently. (Do this just enough to resuspend the cells quickly). Return the tubes to ice for 15 minutes.
7. Pellet the cells by centrifuging at 2700 rpm for 15 minutes 4 °C.
8. Remove the supernatant. Drain residue supernatant from the cell pellets. Do this by turning the tubes upside down on paper towels. Remove the supernatant left on the tube lip and inside wall using tissue. Put the tubes back on ice.
9. Add 4 ml of RF2 to each cell pellet. Gently resuspend each pellet. Leave the resuspended pellets on ice for 15 minutes.
10. Get some liquid nitrogen.
11. Dispense 4 ml of resuspended cell pellet in aliquots of 200 μl to each 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes (can use a dispenser pipette). After aliquoting 4 ml from one tube shut the lids on the 1.5 ml tubes and flash freeze in liquid Nitrogen. Repeat this process with all 8 resuspended cell pellets.
Store the frozen aliquots of competent cells at -80 °C.
For transformation
• Add DNA (ligation mixture or plasmid) to 50 – 75 ul of cells from -80C stock
• 30 min on ice
• Heat shock
o Either 2 min @ 42C or 4 min @ 37C
• Tubes back on ice and add 300 ul TY medium
• 45 min – 1,5h at 37C
• Plate 25 and 250 ul on TY-agar plates containing antibiotic
________________________________________
NOTE (by Robyn): 2xTY broth (apparently required for the preparation of the competent cells) can also be replaced by simple TY broth. So don't bother preparing 2xTY! Protocol works brilliantly.
