Survey and discussion with the church choir
The church choir filled in a survey where they have to indicate what they already know about synthetic biology, what their point of view is about synthetic biology and if they think that it is possible to emphasize the positive impact of synthetic biology and draw the public's attention to its useful applications with the help of this song. The results of the survey were quite positive: about 70% of the church choir would like to know more about synthetic biology. About 40% of the church choir already had some knowledge about synthetic biology and 90% of this group feels the importance of synthetic biology for scientific applications. The final question in the survey was if this song could help emphasizing the positive impact of synthetic biology and draw the public's attention to its useful applications. There was a little discussion about this question going on. About 50% agreed and think it can emphasize the positive impact of synthetic biology, but the other 50% disagreed partially. They say that the approach is very original, but it is probably not enough to create an increased positive impact to society.
Lyrics of enzymes will digest
Verse 1
Combine genes with functions
And promotors too
Make up a new system
Try to make it work
Transcribe the genes and translate
But before this we have to clone
Chorus
Enzymes will digest The DNA that is involved
Ligate and transform Parts that we create ourselves
Glory and honor
If it did work
Enzymes will digest
Check it if it is OK
Verse 2
Why has my PCR
Failed while it should not
Later on it works out
with blood sweat and tears
we struggle in the wetlab
modelers trying to help out
Chorus
Enzymes will digest The DNA that is involved
Ligate and transform Parts that we create ourselves
Glory and honor
If it did work
Enzymes will digest
Check it if it is OK
Chorus 2 (with modulation to G)
Enzymes will digest The DNA that is involved
Ligate and transform Parts that we create ourselves
Glory and honor
If it did work
Enzymes will digest
Check it if it is OK
