name: Jori Huisman
country: I think Netherlands
study: Something with computers and robots and lasers
I like computers and robots and lasers
I don't like yellow cars
When I was 10, I wanted to become a robot
I cannot become a robot :(
I would like to (be able to) become a robot
My favourite color: yellow and robot grey
My favourite farytale: the beauty and the robot
My favourite drink is machine oil because robots cannot drink beer
Before I die, I want to become a robot with a laser
When I'm bored, I imagine I am a robot
If I would be a superhero, my power would be to do those things that transformers do
People, who don't like me, say I'm not a robot
People, who like me, say I'm like an efficient robot
If I win the lottery, I will buy a robot
