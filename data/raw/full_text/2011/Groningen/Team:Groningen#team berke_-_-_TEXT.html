name: Berke Gurkan
country: Turkey
study: Molecular Biology and Genetics
I like playing rugby
I don't like people who can touch their eyes with their fingers
When I was 10, I wanted to become a movie director like Spielberg
I cannot breakdance
I would like to (be able to) speak all of the languages fluently (even the made up ones)
My favourite color: Red
My favourite farytale: Bluebeard
My favourite drink is beer mixed with even more beer, because my awesome beer belly makes me happy .
Before I die, I want to make sure there is a thing called reincarnation!
When I'm bored, I play Pokemon Red on my laptop!
If I would be a superhero, my power would be to save and load the timeline whenever I want
People, who don't like me, say I'm a male genitelia!!
People, who like me, say I'm a pretty fun guy to hang around with!
If I win the lottery, I will probably use the money to buy more lottery tickets.
