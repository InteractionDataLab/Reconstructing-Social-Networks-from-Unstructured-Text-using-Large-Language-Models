The idea and design of the circuit was developed by the team members in the beginning of the project. The supervisors only had a consultative function.
All experiments and the modeling were planned and carried out by the team. The wet-lab team was supervised by Jan-Willem Veening. Maarten Mols advised us with the flow cytometer.
The team also took care of the sponsoring and other organisational issues.
The logo was made and designed by Judit González Barcina. For more information: http://www.sacajugo.com
We received a plasmid containing pBAD/araC sequence (Invitrogen) from Franz Bianchi of the Membrane Enzymology research group.
