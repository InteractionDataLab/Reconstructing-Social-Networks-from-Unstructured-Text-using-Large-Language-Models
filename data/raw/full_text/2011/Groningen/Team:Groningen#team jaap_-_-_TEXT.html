name: Jaap Oosterbroek
country: Netherlands
study: Artificial Intelligence
I like kisses under a waterfall, complicated boardgames, obscure vocabulary.
I don't like spicy food, computer memory errors and artistic mediocracy.
When I was 10, I wanted to become a Dictator in a Central-American Republic.
I cannot Cook.
I would like to (be able to) drive a van through northen Africa.
My favourite color: Blue. No, yel... AAAArg
My favourite fairytale: I don't like fairytales.
My favourite drink is La Trappe Quadruple , because of the user manual.
Before I die, I want to see all seven continents.
When I'm bored, I write code.
If I would be a superhero, my power would be Telekenesis
People, who don't like me, say I'm annoying.
People, who like me, say I'm honest.
If I win the lottery, I will most likely have failed at my statistics course.
