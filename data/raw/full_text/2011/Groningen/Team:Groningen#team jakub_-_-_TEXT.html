name: Jakub Radzikowski
country: Poland
study: Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and the University of Groningen
I like everything that has good quality
I don't like things that are done in a sloppy, uncaring way
When I was 10, I wanted to become a logistics expert
I cannot snap my fingers
I would like to have a pilot's license
My favourite color: green and yellow
My favourite farytale: that one about pigs and a wolf
My favourite drink is Long Island Ice Tea, because it has almost every alcohol in it.
Before I die, I want to sail around the world
When I'm bored, I watch comedy series
If I would be a superhero, my power would be to be able to stop time
People, who don't like me, say I'm repeating myself all the time
People, who like me, say I have a good sense of humor
If I win the lottery, I will have a lot of money to invest
