Chet Chamberlain
Chet and his wife, Michaela
Chet will graduate from BYU in April 2012 with a major in microbial genetics and biotechnology and minors in molecular biology and business management.  He was first attracted to his field of study by an iGEM presentation he stumbled across on YouTube a few years ago.  He would love to solve some of the world's greatest problems through synthetic biology.
Chet is on an intramural ultimate frisbee team, in two local airsoft clubs, and teaches a New Testament class at his church.
