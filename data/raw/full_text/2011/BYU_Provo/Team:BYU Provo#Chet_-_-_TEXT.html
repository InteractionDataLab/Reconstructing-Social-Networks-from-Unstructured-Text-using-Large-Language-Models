Chet Chamberlain
Chet is majoring in Genetics and Biotechnology with an emphasis in Microbial Genetics and  minors in Business Management and Microbiology.  Watching online videos of the 2008 iGEM competition inspired him to choose his field of study.  He has two magazine subscriptions: Liahona (Italian) and Scientific American.  He loves bonsai trees, airsoft, ultimate frisbee, and trying new foods.  He dislikes giving blood and hopes that his research in synthetic biology will one day help him make the ultimate contribution to the Red Cross - bacteria capable of producing blood without the need of those scary needles.
