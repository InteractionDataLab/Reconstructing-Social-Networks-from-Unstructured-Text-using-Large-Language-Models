The ligation WORKED!!! Finally! Mackay picked 8 colonies from the ligation plate and re-patched them onto new plates. He also suspended part of the colonies in water and boiled them, to use as template for the colony PCR. Matt came in later and set up the colony PCR.
Looks like every colony but one had the correct insert.
10 May 2011
At Dr. Grose's request, Matt came in and set up a diagnostic restriction digest to make extra sure the ligation had worked. Digested with EcoRI and XhoI.
May 12
Added new primers to database. Replated colonies so we could freeze down some strains tomorrow.
