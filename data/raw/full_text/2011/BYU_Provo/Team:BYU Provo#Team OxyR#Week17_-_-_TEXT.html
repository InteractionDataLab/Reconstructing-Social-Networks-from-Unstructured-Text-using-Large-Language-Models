Outreach
 
10 August 2011
Upon closer examination of the data, Dr. Grose felt like that massive peak was due to cell death (dividing by an extremely small OD gave a really tall peak). She recommended cleaning up our protocol a bit, and using our low-copy plasmid from the iGEM library of parts.  Rob set up some overnight cultures and placed them on the shaker in the incubator room.
