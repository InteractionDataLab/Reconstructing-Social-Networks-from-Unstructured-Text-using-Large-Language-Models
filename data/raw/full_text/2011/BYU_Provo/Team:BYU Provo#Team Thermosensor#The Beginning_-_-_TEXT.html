Week Feb. 21 – 27
Feb. 22
Made PCR for thermosensor will check prouct tomorrow
Feb. 23
PCR products checked, thermosensor appears to have been amplified correctly
pPLAT extracted via qiaprep plasmid prep protocol
Week Feb. 28 – Mar. 6
Feb. 28
Phusion PCR for GFP in Thermosensor system
~35 uL ddH2O
10uL 5X phusion buffer
1.5uL 10mM dNTP’s
1uL each primer
1uL of diluted template DNA
0.5 uL phusion polymerase
Purified PCR samples according to Qiagen Kit
Restriction Digest of insert and vector inserting thermosensor into pPLAT
PCR product(insert) digestion (50uL rxn)
~14uL H2O
5uL 10X NEB buffer
0.5 uL 100X BSA
30uL DNA sample
1-2uL each restriction enzyme
Vector Digestion (50uL rxn)
~14uL H2O
5uL 10X NEB buffer
.5 uL 100X BSA
30uL DNA sample
1-2 uL each restriction enzyme
Placed reactions in 37o bath for 1.5 hr+
Mar. 2
Restriction Digests actually done today
Running a gel of purified thermoswitch and purified GFP
(thermoswitch in 3rd well and GFP in 5th well)
Mar. 4
Product from redo thermoswitch PCR
Week Mar. 21 – 27
Mar. 23
Low Melt gel ran on vector and insert, bands cut out and gel cut-outs melted at 65oC
Received pGLO from Dr. Grose on Monday to be transformed into competent cells to act as a positive control for GFP
pPLAT can be transformed into competent cells(DH5-a) as a neg. control
(GFP was more widely used by the OxyR team so they did the transformation of pGLO into competent cells)
Began ligation for pPLAT and pBAD cut at BamHI and EcoRI
6.5 uL H2O
1.5uL 10X ligase buffer
1 uL T4 DNA ligase
3uL vector
3uL insert (didn’t put insert in control)
