Devin Sabin
Devin experimenting with all-natural, hole-less earrings
Devin is a Senior majoring in Microbiology. As a sophomore, he isolated the novel micobacteriophage Sabinator through HHMI's Phagehunter program.  He then started working in Dr. Robison's Pathogenesis lab with a new antibiotic and MRSA. Last winter, he took a break from classes to work as an intern for BD Diagnostics out in Baltimore, Maryland. Eventually he plans on going to graduate school to earn a PhD in Pathology. His love of working with his hands has combined with his interest in biology to fuel his desire to pursue a career in laboratory research.
In his spare time, Devin enjoys riding four-wheelers, playing ultimate frisbee and has a knack for finding free stuff.
