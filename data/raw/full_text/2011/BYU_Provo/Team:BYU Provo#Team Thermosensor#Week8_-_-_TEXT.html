Week 8 (June 5 - 11)
6/7
Added 6 ul loading dye to each PCR reaction tube and ran on gel @ 160 V for 17 min
Lane 1 - DNA ladder
Lane 2 - 24-1
Lane 3 - 24-2
Lane 4 - 24-3
It appears that lacZ amplified correctly, but pBAD did not for whatever reason, we had very little template left (PJG408) that could be part of the issue
6/6/11
Ligation for pBAD into pPLAT; put in tube labeled Lig 23-1
6.5 ul H2O
1.5 ul 10x ligase buffer
1 ul T4 ligase
*1 ul vector (23-2)
*1 ul insert (23-1)
- Incubate for 30 min at room temp
Transformation
Followed Dr. Grose’s procedures. Incubated in 37 degree incubator overnight. - Addison
Back on ice @ 3:27
Take out of incubator @ 4:13
6/7
It appears that there is no cell growth on the plate labeled 6/6 23-1
Set up PCR for pBAD following volumes on prev. page
There is lacZ still in stock
Ran on “Phusion10” in Grose’s labe.
+25-1
pBAD recipe same as 24-1
We have pBAD!
PCR clean-up of pBAD
T26-1 PCRup w/ Dr. Grose
Low melt of T26-1 PCRup
Strong band, very nice looking
Cut out gel slice w/ Dr. Grose
pBAD GS T26-1
Ligation of pBAD w/ Dr/. Grose
Used insert: GS T26-1 and vector: GS T23-2
T26-1 pBAD + 23-2
Lig
6.5 ul H2O
1.5 ul 10x ligase buffer
1 ul T4 DNA ligase
3 ul vector
3 ul insert
mix and sit for min
T26-1
Tran
T26-1 + 23-2
pBAD ligation transformed into E. coli DH5alpha
Plate
pBAD 26-1
pPLAT 23-2
Transformation
Placed in 37*C. If we have growth the next thing is colony PCR
We have growth!!
6/9/11
Colony PCR 26-1
Took 8 colonies from plate T26-1 and swirled them in 50 ul of H2O and then plated on “T26-1 lig” and placed the plate in 37*C overnight
Took the PCR tubes with 50 ul of H2O + the 8 colonies + boiled in thermocycle - this will then be used as template for the colony PCR
19 ul of H2O
2.5 ul Rxn buffer
0.5 ul 10mM dNTPs
0.5 ul IG11 (forward) primers
0.5 ul IG 12 (reverse) primers
0.5 ul Phusion DNA polymerase
2 ul boiled colony sample
Master Mix T26-1
171 ul H2O
22.5 ul 5x Rxn buffer
4.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs
4.5 ul IG11
4.5 ul IG12
4.5 ul Phusion polymerase
+ add 2 ul boiled colony sample + 23.5 ul of master mix to each tube
Ran in Phusion 10
OOPS...USE Taq LIKE PROTOCOL CALLS FOR ON COLONY PCR...My bad
This was just the boiled template. I labeled the template and the PCR similarly, my fault...I will label the colony PCR as PCR next time + the template as “T” followed by a number.
Lanes 2-8=Tubes 1-8. No verification of insert. Will retry another colony PCR
Reused colonies 1-8 and boiled them from plate T-26-1
Master Mix A T26-A
171 ul H2O
22.5 ul 5x Rxn buffer
4.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs
4.5 ul IG11
4.5 ul IG12
4.5 Taq polymerase
add 2ul boiled colonies + 23.5 ul of this mix to each tube
Master Mix B T26-B
171 ul H2O
22.5 ul 5x Rxn buffer
4.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs
4.5 ul IG12
4.5 ul IG38
4.5 Taq polymerase
PCR: Ran 26-1 on a gel @165V for 18 min
It worked! It appears that we have pBAD in the pPLAT plasmid
Next step is to sequence the plasmid just to verify that it really worked and then we can put GFP and lacZ into the plasmid as well
No need to sequence...it’s a promoter
