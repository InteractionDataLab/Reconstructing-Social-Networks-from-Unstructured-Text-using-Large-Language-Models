Julie Roberts
Julie Roberts
Julie is a senior at Brigham Young University studying Genetics and Biotechnology. She plans to further her education in bioengineering and to thereby contribute to the growth of synthetic biology. IGEM was the start to her participation in undergraduate research and has promoted her interest in the study of synthetic biology. Since joining BYU’s iGEM team she began working in Dr. Steve Johnson’s lab studying genetic effects of nucleosome positioning.  In addition, she recently began working on a biofuel project with Dr. Julianne Grose and Dr. Randy Lewis.  Outside of the books Julie enjoys dancing, and running, as she participated in her first marathon last summer in Park City Utah. She has also spent time working with a community of persons with disabilities and has enjoyed the challenges and rewards that working with them has brought her.
