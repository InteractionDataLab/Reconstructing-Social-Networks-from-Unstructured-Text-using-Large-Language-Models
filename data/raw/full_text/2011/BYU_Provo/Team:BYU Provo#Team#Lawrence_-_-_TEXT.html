Lawrence Williams
Lawrence Williams and a waterfall.
Lawrence is a Junior studying Computer Science at BYU. He's loved computers ever since his parents got his grandfather's Tandy 1000 computer that could run only DOS and BASIC, but it ran them well. Since it didn't have any video games his entertainment consisted of putting random numbers into a Quatro Pro spreadsheet and clicking the "Create Graph" button.
Since then he's worked in C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, C#, HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and briefly in LOLCODE . Very briefly. He currently works for BYU developing software to manage campus computers and builds websites on the side. Some of his work is available at:
