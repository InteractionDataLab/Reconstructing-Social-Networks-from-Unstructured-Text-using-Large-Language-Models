Matt and Rob came in and set up colony PCR to check the OxyR-Med ligations. Rob was the master of boiling/patching colonies.
19 July 2011
PCR results from July 18th:
20 July 2011
Purified plasmids from the most recent round of transformations (using the colonies that passed the colony PCR test).
21 July 2011
Performed another ligation trying the katG promoter again.
22 July 2011
Plates that Matt started (the ligation from July 21st) were only pinpricks in the morning. Rob allowed them to grow a bit longer.
23 July 2011
Mackay set up a colony PCR checking the KatG/OxyR-Medium construct again (the one that hadn't been working).
