Sequencing results back
pIG 15-IG40 (396bp)--aligned with lacZ from pcDNA3_lv5hislacz_seq
score 250 bits
identities 164/188 (87%)
Strand plus/plus
E=4.8e^-70
pIG16-IG40 (640bp)--aligned with lacZ from pcDNA3_lv5hislacz_seq
Score 1029 bits
E=0
pIG17-IG12 (963bp)--aligned with sfGFP sequence from Dr. Bundy
No significant match
pIG 15 and pIG16 have inserted correctly! We can go ahead and move forward with those!
pIG17 & most likely pIG18 don’t have GFP

Boiled template for LacZ∆TS (setting up to check for thermosensor insertion)
selected 8 colonies, diluted in 50microliters ddH20, then streaked on 8-slice plate (41-1). Also streaked for GFP∆TS (41-2)

7/20/11
Standard Taq PCR set up as colony PCR for 8 colonies from plates 41-1 and 42-1.
Plate 41-1 colony PCR only because 41-2 colony PCR got “royally messed up” Not certain of the accuracy.
7/21/11
Remade boiled template so we can redo colony PCR if needed
T41-1 boiled template M
T41-2 boiled template M
Ran Gel on previously set up colony PCR--there are two bands, one looks like possible thermosensor, the other is unknown
Made XGAL/ARA/AMP plates:
10g bacto-tryptone
5g yeast
5g NaCl
5g Agar
.1g Arabinose
1ml Amp
1ml X-Gal
7 July 2011
Made LB/amp/ara/x-gal plates, put in fridge. Be CAEFUL: one bag has unlabeled plates. Label once dry.
