Week 16 (July 30 - Aug. 6)
6 August 2011
Turns out the thermosensor primers were bad bad bad.  Dr. Grose performed a cloning using redesigned DeltaTS primers. I looked at the plate today, almost all colonies were big and blue! I set up the boiled template from 7 of the colonies to be able to do colony PCR and check for insertion. Tubes labeled boiled tamplate 47-1. plastic labeling on tubes. Pie slices on xgal plate which plate is in the 30oC incubator.
