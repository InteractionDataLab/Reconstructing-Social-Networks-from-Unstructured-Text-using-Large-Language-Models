Outreach
 
30 June 2011
Rob set up overnight cultures with the most recently cloned oxyR construct.
1 July 2011
We ran through the first version of the plate reader experiment. It was simple, with only 5 hydrogen peroxide concentrations, based on what we learned about oxyR from Ecocyc.org.  The results were not clear. This first time, we didn't take the OD, which  meant we couldn't normalize for relative fluorescence. This made our results inconclusive.
