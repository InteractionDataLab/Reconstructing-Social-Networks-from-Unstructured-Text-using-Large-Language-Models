At 6 PM, plates 2-1 were placed in 42º incubator in Dr. Grose’s lab after being marked.
Marked with an “M” the colonies that are now blue in the 42º
Colonies 5-5-10-10 may have been on plates without enough x-gal in them or something, because not even the controls turned blue

Plated all the old and new blue colonies from the plates that we watched change hour by hour
The colonies that changed from 37º-->42º are labeled 42-1A-->42-10A
“A” means they were from the new batch
Put in 30º incubator. Dr. Grose would like to see them before we start the next phase of the experiment
