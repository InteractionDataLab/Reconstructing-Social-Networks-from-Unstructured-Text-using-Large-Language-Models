Week 2 (Apr. 24-30)
Set up and ran PCR on boiled template to check for pBAD insert. To check for instertion we used primers pPlat forward and pPlat reverse. These primers are just outside our multiple cloning site, thus, as this is our first insert, if we have inserted correctly the amplified DNA will be a much longer sequence than if insert is missing. The total length should be slightly longer that 1500bp.
