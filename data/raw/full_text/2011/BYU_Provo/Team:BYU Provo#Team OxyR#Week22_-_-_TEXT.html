15 September 2011
Set up overnight cultures for plate reader experiment on the 16th.
16 September 2011
Results from the plate reader experiment.
Last week's results were misleading. Dr. Grose showed us how the OD was so low, that when we normalized the fluorescence it made it appear like the cells were responding to the H2O2, but not so. This weeks results were no different.
