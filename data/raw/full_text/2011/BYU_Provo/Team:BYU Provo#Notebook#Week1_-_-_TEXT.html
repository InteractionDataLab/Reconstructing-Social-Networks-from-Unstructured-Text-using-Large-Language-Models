From 2011.igem.org
Monday May 2nd We have begun our journey of engineering our "dual switch" e.coli. We have designed primers for and amplified pBAD, GFP, and our thermosensor. We began with inserting pBAD into our plasmid, as it is going to be fundamental to any design we choose (our various thermosensors as well as if we decide to try lacz as well as GFP for our read out).  Today we set up a colony PCR to check for the PBAD insertion. When gel was run we could see very bright bands at the bottom (less than 500 bp) and very faint bands at about 1500 bp, thus we think there is a good possibility of pBAD insertion.
