Matt and Jessica hiking the Y
Matt is a senior at BYU studying bioinformatics with an aim to tackle bioengineering in graduate school. On the side he works in Dr. Griffitts' lab identifying antibiotic targets using randomized peptide aptamers, and in Dr. Evan's molecular biology lab sequencing DNA samples from fish and Egyptian mummies. He enjoys playing soccer, watching old episodes of the X-Files and baking bread.
His wife Jessica is also a student at BYU studying political science, and they enjoy reading books, hiking and eating ice cream together. Both will graduate in April 2012.
