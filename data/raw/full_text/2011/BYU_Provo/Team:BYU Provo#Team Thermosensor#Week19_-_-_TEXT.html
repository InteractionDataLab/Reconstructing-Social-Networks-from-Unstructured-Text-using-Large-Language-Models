Aug. 22
Plates left over weekend...not sure if TS is working properly colony 1 from griff med looks great, but no guarantee on the others.
With so few colonies 2nd transformation set up including a new one for griffshort
Griffshort annealing 53-5
10 uL IG59 griffshort for
10 uL IG64 griff short rev
ran on boil program
let stand for > 10 min.
Standard Ligation rxn 53-6
6.5 uL ddH2O
1.5 uL 10X ligase buffer
1 uL T4 DNA ligase
3 uL vector (pIG 15 gel)
3 uL inser (53-5 griffshort)
Set up Transformations for 51-6 (mutation 11), 51-7 (griff med) , 53-6 (griff short) and the purified plasmids TSA, I, and J.

Mutagenic PCR – In order to get a wide range of different thermosensors we will be using a low fidelity PCR technique.  Our template DNA will be from the purified plasmid TSA which contains a thermosensor designed to be similar a thermosensor found in listeria monocytogenes.  As the PCR is carried out random nucleotides will be placed causing many different mutations of the TSA thermosensor. We will be using protocol similar to that found in the paper “Generation of synthetic RNA-based thermosensors” (T. Waldminghaus et. al.)
First created a  CT/GA stock
10mM CT (20 uL) --> same for GA
2uL C 100mM
2uL T 100mM
16uL ddH2O
20 uL total  = 10mM C/T
2mM CT         --> same for GA
1uL 10mM C/T
4 uL ddH2O
5 uL C/T 2mM stock
Dilute MnCl2 10mM --> 5mM
40uL total
20uL MnCl2
20uL ddH2O
55-1 Master mix
108uL ddH2O
20uL  pol. buffer
15uL C/T (10mM)
5uL G/A (2mM)
15uL primer IG54
15uL primer IG47
2uL Taq polymerase
20uL 5mM MnCl2
40uL of master mix in tubes 1-4
Added 1.5uL purified plasmid TSA to each PCR tube
55-2 Master Mix
108uL ddH2O
20uL pol. buffer
15uL GA 10mM stock
5uL CT 2mM stock
15uL primer IG54
15uL primer IG47
2uL Taq polymerase
20uL 5mM MnCl2
40uL of master mix in tubes 5-8
Added 1.5 uL purified plasmid TSA to each PCR tube
Ran PCR according to GB1 mutagenesis protocol
24 August 2011
Plated to plates from plates TSA, I and J to test for thermosensor activity.  One plate incubated at 30’C overnight and the other at 37’C.
Results: All 3 have more LacZ expression at 37o . TSI has very minimal LacZ expression at 30o and J and A are mostly white.
Ran gel on mutagenic PCR 55-1 and 55-2.
