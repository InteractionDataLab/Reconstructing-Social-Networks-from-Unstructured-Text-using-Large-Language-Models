Mark Sabin
Mark's Senior picture, he was ahead of his times
Mark is a Junior at BYU majoring in Physiology and Developmental Biology.  He is currently planning on going to dental school.  Dentistry appeals to him because of the change a good smile can have on an individual's life.  This is his fourth semester working as a TA for Dr. Brown in the BYU Chemistry Department.  IGEM will be a great way for Mark to broaden his studies and contribute to the growing field of bioengineering.
In the winter he enjoys snowboarding, and when its not freezing at 12,000 ft. he spends his time skydiving with his Dad.  He is recently engaged to be married to Ariel Johnson on April 29th of this year.
