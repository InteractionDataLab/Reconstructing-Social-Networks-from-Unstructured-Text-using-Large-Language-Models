Indiana Trip
Outreach
 
Regional Jamboree Held in Indianapolis, IN
Our journey started early Saturday morning in a cold rain.
The early hour couldn't dampen our enthusiasm, especially once we arrived at the airport.
A lot of airline passengers learned what synthetic biology was because they sat by one of us.
The BYU team around the poster - our pride and joy.
After a long day of presentations, BYU settled down around a Jenga game that attracted some attention.
