Week 11 (June 26 - Jul 2)
6/27/11
It looks like 33-1 worked, but I don’t know if lacZ and GFP were actually inserted
Doesn’t look like lacZ did, but GFP looks promising.
6/28/11
PCR purfication of 33-1 (lacZ PCR)
Qiaquick PCR purification kit protocol -Julie
lacZ restricition digest (TRD 34-1)
T33-1 PCR up/lacZ with 1 ul of HindIII and XbaI each
pPLAT-Bad restriciton digest (TRD 34-2)
pIG 13 with 1 ul each of HindIII and XbaI
Ran a low melt. Cut out pPLAT-Bad and stuck in 1.5 centrifuge tube. Could not see lacZ band...->doesn’t matter, I used wrong lacZ reverse
We could run another low melt and we may want to PCR it again. Other half of low melt in fridge.
lacZ PCR (35-1)
Phusion polymerase and 1 ul each of IG40 and IG41 primers with pIGGY template
Making two in case there is another purification problem or something
35-2: PCR up of lacZ according to qiaquick instructions
6/30/11
Running gel on lacZ PCR products
Both lanes look good. Now onto restriction digest.
RD lacZ (35-3)
1-2 ul each restricition enzyme (HindIII and XbaI)
35-4 Ran low melt and cut out lacZ band. Very faint, but there!
lacZ/pPlatbad ligation 36-1
T4 ligase, 3 ul vector, 3 ul lacZ (added a little extra b/c faintness of band)
7/1/11
lacZ/pPlatbad transformation
Followed Grose protocol
Plated 100 ul on LB-amp and incubated overnight
Labeled T36-1 lacZ trans 1 July 2011 - Devin
