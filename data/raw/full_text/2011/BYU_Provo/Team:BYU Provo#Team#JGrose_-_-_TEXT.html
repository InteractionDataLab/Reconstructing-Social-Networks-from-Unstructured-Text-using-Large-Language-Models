Dr. Julianne Grose
Dr. Julianne Grose
I graduated with my PhD in Biology from the University of Utah in 2003, having done my graduate work in John Roth's lab studying the regulation of NAD(P) in Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. I completed my postdoctoral work in the lab of Jared Rutter at the University of Utah department of Biochemistry, studying the sensory protein kinase PAS kinase. I have been an Assistant Professor BYU faculty since 2009, where my lab is investigating metabolic regulation in microbial systems.
