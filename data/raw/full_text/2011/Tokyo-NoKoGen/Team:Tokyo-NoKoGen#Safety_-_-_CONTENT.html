Our project will be carried out with E. coli</SPAN><SPAN class="style20"> laboratory strains and we do not use any infectious organisms. Our laboratory work will be carried out in the laboratories of Prof. Sode (advisor), Assoc. Prof. Tsugawa (instructor) and Prof. Ikebukuro (instructor). Those laboratories have a proper facility of the biosafety level 2 to handle </SPAN><SPAN class="style19">E. coli</SPAN><SPAN class="style20"> and perform genetic engineering experiments.</SPAN></P><P><SPAN class="style20">  In our project, we are trying to construct the </SPAN><SPAN class="style19">E. coli</SPAN><SPAN class="style20"> that absorbs Cesium from radioactive-contaminated water. The ultimate aim of our project is to develop an </SPAN><SPAN class="style19">E. coli</SPAN><SPAN class="style20"> machine that can be practically used to clean up radioactive-contaminated environment. However, genetically engineered organisms cannot be easily released to environment. All team members well understand this point. We are just aiming as biotechnologists at showing potential of synthetic biology for those applications that are harmful for humans and cannot be easily achieved by non-biological ways.</SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN class="style16">-Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, </SPAN></P><P class="style18">▪ did you document these issues in the Registry?</P><P class="style18">▪ how did you manage to handle the safety issue?</P><P class="style18">▪ How could other teams learn from your experience?</P><P><SPAN class="style22">   No,they don’t. Our BioBrick parts do not posess any safety risk for environment and researches. We will make a new BioBrick part that uptakes cesium from environment. This part is natively expressed in a non-harmful strain of E. coli and we will clone it from that strain. We are also trying to make new BioBrick parts to regulate gene expressing network. We will use those genes that already have analyzed in peer-reviewed papers. Thus that new BioBrick part will not raise any safety issues. </SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN class="style16">-Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?</SPAN></P><P class="style18">▪ If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?</P><P class="style18">▪ If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?</P><P><SPAN class="style22">   Yes, there is. There is the committee of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, and we are following its safety and ethical guidelines.</SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN class="style16">-Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?</SPAN></P><P class="f-lp"><SPAN class="style22">   Heinrich's Law: for every 300 unsafe acts (no-injury accidents), there are 29 minor injuries and 1 major injury. So, minimizing the number of no­injury accidents will reduce the probability of more severe accidents. We suggest that all teams share any safety issues and solution timely on iGEM web site or wikis. That should prevent the occurrence of more serious hazards.</SPAN></P><P> </P><P><SPAN class="style16">-Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?

We also do not expect any environmental issues or any risks of malicious use by individuals.</SPAN></P><P class="f-lp"><SPAN class="style22">   We will only use typical laboratory E. coli strains (e.g., DH5α) and the engineering experiments we plan to carry out will not introduce any genes that are related to pathogenicity or virulence, or confer any selective advantage were they to be inadvertently or intentionally (maliciously) released into the environment.</SPAN></P><P class="f-lp"><SPAN class="style22">   Our laboratory work will be carried out in the laboratories of Prof. Sode (advisor), Assoc. Prof. Tsugawa (instructor), and Prof. Ikebukuro (instructor), which have a biosafety level 2 facility to handle microorganisms and perform genetic engineering experiments. All the bacteria we handle, whether genetically modified or not, will be either stored at -80°C for future use or disposed of after autoclaving.</SPAN></P><P class="f-lp"><SPAN class="style22">   Although our final product is meant to be used to clean the environment (capture cesium from radioactively contaminated water) it is not meant to be released into the environment.

This is managed by the Gene Research Center of the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology Research Center for Science and Technology [http://www.tuat.ac.jp/%7Eidenshi/index.html (only in Japanese)]. All students have to read the provided guidelines and apply for permission to do genetic engineering before we actually start experiments. All our members had read the guidelines and signed for agreement, and we all have been permitted to carry out genetic engineering experiments.</SPAN></P><P class="style18">▪ Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns or changes that were made based on this review.</P><P class="f-lp"><SPAN class="style22">  We did not discuss our project directly with our Institutional Biosafety Committee, but we do follow their regulations and guidelines. Our instructors are monitoring our experiments closely, and they have not identified any safety issues. </SPAN></P><P class="style18">▪ Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.</P><P class="f-lp"><SPAN class="style22">   All team members have undergone a one year undergraduate lab course, which covered all relevant safety guidelines.
