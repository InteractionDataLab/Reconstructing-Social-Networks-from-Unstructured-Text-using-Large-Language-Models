Tokyo_NoKoGen 2011 is built up of 10 students, 2 advisors, and 3 instructors. Student members through discussion with the advisors and instructors decided our project concepts. All laboratory works were only done by student members (Kotone, Shoko, Yuki, Chifuku, Saki, Masataka, Eri, Koichi, and Hikaru) in the laboratories at the Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Our wiki was designed and constructed by ourselves(Our wiki was designed and constructed by Nasa. The contents were mainly written by Nasa, Kotone, Shoko, and Masataka. Chifuku made nice figures.). Sponsors only supported by providing laboratories to work at, experimental materials, and funding. All team members very much enjoyed doing our project and greatly appreciate Assist. Prof. Ferri, Prof. Ikebukuro, and Prof. Sode for all their supports.
