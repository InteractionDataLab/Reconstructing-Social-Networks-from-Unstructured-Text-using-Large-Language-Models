Bacterial Chemotaxis
During the 17th century, the advent of the light microscope allowed scientists to                                     observe “tiny particles” that were proposed to be living due to their seemingly                                     purposeful motion (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). It was only in the 19th century                                     when these directed bacterial movements were first characterised by Wilhelm Pfeffer                                     (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). Pfeffer’s work described the ability of bacteria to                                     navigate through complex environments, in response to changes in temperature (thermotaxis),                                     osmolarity (osmotaxis), light (phototaxis) and chemical substrates (chemotaxis) (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).
Bacterial chemotaxis is a regulated response that involves the processing of chemical                                     substrates as input signals, into physical movements that result in bacterial motility                                     (Topp and Gallivan 2007). This response allows for bacteria to selectively move                                     along chemical gradients (Vladimirov, Lebiedz et al. 2010) (Fig 1), directing them                                     towards substances that are favourable to their survival, and away from noxious                                     substances (Adler 1975). Therefore, chemotaxis confers an important survival advantage                                     to bacteria, particularly in their natural, non-mixed environment in which chemical                                     gradients exist (Adler 1975; Vladimirov, Lebiedz et al. 2010).

Motile bacteria are endowed with flagella, which are long, helical projections that                                     are anchored to the cell surface (Adler 1975) (Fig 2). At the base of the flagella,                                     there is a rotary motor that is powered by the electrochemical energy that is generated                                     by a transmembrane ion flux (Berg 2003; Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). This motor                                     device induces reversible rotation of the flagella, which serves as the impetus                                     for bacterial cell propulsion (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). In the well studied                                     E. coli, there is an array of flagella at one pole of the cell that function collectively                                     to induce cell motility (Berg 2003). During the course of its movement, two types                                     of motions are exhibited: running and tumbling.                                     Running is associated with the flagella rotating in a counter-clockwise direction,                                     forming a bundle that works to propel the cell forward in a directed manner. Alternatively,                                     tumbling is the result of the flagella rotating in a clockwise direction, disrupting                                     the flagella bundle and causing the bacterial cell to fall in solution (Fig 3).                                     This allows for the cell to re-orientate itself and for the direction of its runs                                     to be changed, if deemed necessary. The frequency of each of these two motions varies,                                     depending on the environmental signals that are transduced to the flagella motors.                                     Chemotactic bacteria are able to make spatial as well as temporal comparisons of                                     the concentration of the substance that they encounter, allowing them to regulate                                     their motion in response to an increasing or decreasing concentration gradient (Adler                                     1975). In the event that the bacterial cell is moving towards an attractant or away                                     from a repellent, the movement is direct and is characterised by longer runs and fewer tumbles. However, in a uniform environment, the two motions alternate in such                                     a way that the cell moves in a random walk (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).

Adler and colleagues were the first to describe the intracellular signal transduction                                     network involved in chemotaxis that is responsible for the relay of information                                     from the environment, through the cell and to the flagella motor proteins (Baker,                                     Wolanin et al. 2006). This led on to the elucidation of the existence and the function                                     of a group of proteins that are responsible for this intracellular signalling known                                     as the Che proteins (Fig 4).

This signalling cascade begins at the cell surface, where there is an interaction                                     between a ligand and a bacterial chemoreceptor. E. coli has five types of transmembrane                                     chemoreceptors that exist as large polar clusters (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006; Topp                                     and Gallivan 2007). These receptor proteins have highly variable periplasmic domains,                                     allowing E. coli cells to respond to over 30 different compounds even with a minimal                                     number of receptor types (Adler 1975; Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). The intracellular                                     domain, on the other hand, is highly conserved and provides the scaffolding for                                     the intracellular membrane associated Che protein complex. CheW directly binds to                                     these conserved regions of the chemoreceptor to serve as an adapter between the                                     chemoreceptor and the CheA protein, to form the intracellular Che protein complex                                     (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).
CheA is a large and complex histidine kinase that is able to phosphorylate its own                                     histidine residues, using ATP as its substrate. This autophosphorylation of CheA                                     results in the phosphorylation of CheY, which is a monomeric protein that is usually                                     bound to CheA. Phospho-CheY (p-CheY) has a decreased affinity for CheA, resulting                                     in its dissociation from the membrane associated Che protein complex. In this unbound                                     state, p-CheY rapidly diffuses to the flagella switch proteins (FliM) and functions                                     as an allosteric regulator to induce clockwise rotation of the flagella. The overall                                     affect is the tumbling of the bacterial cell (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006; Topp and                                     Gallivan 2007). This process is the native state of the system and occurs without                                     chemoreceptor stimulation. However, when the bacterial cell encounters an attractant                                     or a repellent that binds to a specific chemoreceptor, a ligand-induced conformational                                     change occurs in the chemoreceptor. These changes may include piston-like movements                                     and rotation of the receptor protein, which serves as the signal to the intracellular                                     Che protein complex (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). This inhibits the kinase activity                                     of the CheA protein, which will abrogate the production of p-CheY. Flagella motor                                     proteins, in the absence of p-CheY regulation, produce counter clockwise flagella                                     movements which result in directed bacterial swimming (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).
The complexity of the signal transduction network that is responsible for chemotaxis                                     lies within the mechanisms of its regulation. Factors that regulate the intracellular                                     p-CheY concentration dictate the motion of the flagella and ultimately, the movement                                     of the bacterial cell (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). p-CheY concentrations are regulated                                     by transmembrane signals that modulate the kinase activity of CheA. However, there                                     are other Che proteins that are peripheral to the main signalling cascade that can                                     also regulate the p-CheY concentration.
CheR and CheB are methyl transferases and demethylases, respectively (Baker, Wolanin                                     et al. 2006). They are responsible for the methylation state of the cytoplasmic                                     domain of the chemoreceptors. Methylation of the chemoreceptor induces clockwise                                     rotation of the flagella, whereas demethylation causes counter-clockwise rotation                                     (Eisenbach 2001). This is thought to occur via conformational changes of the chemoreceptor                                     as a result of methylation or demethylation (Eisenbach 2001). The state of methylation                                     of the receptor is important as it modifies the sensitivity of the chemoreceptor,                                     to prevent sensory saturation as the bacteria travel towards higher or lower concentrations                                     (Sourjik 2004). Moreover, it provides a mechanism of short term memory, allowing                                     for temporal comparisons of the stimulant concentration (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).
Another protein that can regulate bacterial chemotaxis is CheZ. This is a phosphatase                                     that dephosphorylates p-CheY, freeing it from the flagella FliM protein and restoring                                     the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella to elicit running (Topp and Gallivan 2007). Therefore, CheZ influences the intracellular concentration of p-CheY directly,                                     and is capable of modulating the motion that the bacterial chemotaxis.
