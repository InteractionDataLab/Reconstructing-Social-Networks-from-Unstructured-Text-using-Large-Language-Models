Acknowledgements
The Wits-CSIR 2011 iGEM team was proudly sponsored by:
The Wits-CSIR 2011 iGEM team would like to thank all the above sponsors for their generous financial contributions, which lightened the team’s financial burden thus allowing them to focus their attention on the project. Your generosity has inspired the team to help others and give back to the community, through human advances.
We would like to thank Imperial College London for collaborating with us during this competition. We feel that the exchange of information, both for modelling and for laboratory assays, was invaluable.
The Wits_CSIR 2011 iGEM team would like to thank the following advisors and supervisors for their moral and scientific support, especially; the supervisors for leading the team effectively and efficiently in this competitive, fast-paced and ever-changing world of synthetic biology; and Michelle Robinson for her tenacious effort to keep the team on track by assisting the team with implementing time management and organisational skills of the highest calibre.
Supervisors
Karl Rumbold: Organisation of team logistics and fundraising as well as project consultation
Marco Weinberg: Consultation on various aspects of the project throughout the competition and help with fundraising
