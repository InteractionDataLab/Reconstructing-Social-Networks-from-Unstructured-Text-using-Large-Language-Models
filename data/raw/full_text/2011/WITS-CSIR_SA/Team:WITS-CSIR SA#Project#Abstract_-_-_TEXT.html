Biotweet - Abstract
sidebar
One of the defining characteristics of humanity is the constantly evolving sophistication                                     with which human beings communicate and store information: from the earliest cave                                     drawings, smoke signals and tablet carvings, to the printing press, telephony, the                                     Internet and future cloud computing. The recent advent of the Internet perfectly                                     encapsulates this phenomenon of global interconnectedness - allowing for the worldwide                                     communication between cultures, organisations and individuals, through a single                                     data network entity.
Biologically, data communication networks exist too. The transfer of data occurs                                     via signalling molecules incorporated into highly regulated and integrated networks.                                     Our goal is to construct an automated bacterial communication network that will                                     allow a group of genetically engineered bacteria to transport messages in a directed                                     manner, with the final aim of completing location-based functional tasks. Such a                                     biological network can be engineered to function in specific applications and assist                                     in carrying out the tasks involved in the pipeline of a particular process, be it                                     medical or industrial.
We have focused on one aspect of this network: the directed transport of the message-carrying                                     “communication modules” within our biological network. These communication modules                                     will take the form of bacteria, which can move over physical distances carrying                                     information. The content of the message - designed to elicit a desired output -                                     is, of course, vital to the eventual application. However, the successful delivery                                     and transport of these messages to other effector bacteria - dictating the end-points                                     of the data network - is of vital importance for proof of concept. Thus, we will                                     attempt to engineer the exogenously controlled chemotactic behaviour of bacteria                                     using synthetic riboswitches to regulate the expression of a protein required for                                     bacterial motility. This will allow for their directed movement towards a desired                                     location where they can deliver the message: a biological analogy to the Transmission                                     Control Protocol (TCP) of the Internet, which delivered the data to your computer                                     allowing you to read this abstract.
