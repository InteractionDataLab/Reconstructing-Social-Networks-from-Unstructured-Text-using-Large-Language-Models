Collaboration
The Wits CSIR iGEM team collaborated with Imperial College London, both for the modelling and the potential suitability of motility experiments in the testing of our machines. The biologists in our team and those at Imperial College London had a number of skype conferences to discuss the progress of our lab work as well as to share insight into both qualitative and quantitative assay for motility.
We provided Imperial College London with some ideas regarding motility assays using TTC in stab agar. Their team gave us some tips about the preparation of cells for motility experiments and recommended spinning down the bacteria and resuspending them in a low volume of broth to increase the density of cells. They also recommended the use of capillary motility assays.  There was an exchange of protocols both ways to aid in the set-up of our experiments. A week later we discussed the progress we had made in the lab. We gave each other tips and suggested more assays to indicate the ability of our bacteria to move towards a stimulus. Imperial College London shared with us a type of capillary assay they were performing at the time and we, too, shared a protocol with them which is detailed in Gullivan and Topps (2006) paper, Guiding bacteria with small molecules and RNA.
Collaboration was also performed between the engineers to improve the modeling for both the teams. Several Skype conferences were held between the team from Imperial College London and the Wits CSIR team to discuss the design and theory behind our own chemotaxis models. The collaborative effort resulted in the Imperial College London kindly providing us with a model for our theophylline riboswitches. Their modelling results can be found on our href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:WITS-CSIR_SA/Project/Modelling">modelling page.
