Competent <I>E. coli</I> (strain DH5a) cells were transformed with plasmid vectors containing the riboswitch and were cultured until the mid-log phase of growth. Thereafter, a different concentration of theophylline was added to each culture for induction. The activation of the riboswitch was detected as a fluorescent response as a result of increased translation of the fluorescent fusion protein CheZ-Venus, in the presence of the activator. A Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer was used to excite the cultures at 514 nm and the intensity of the emission peak was detected at 528 nm. Twenty readings were taken every 15 minutes for each culture, for a total period of 135 minutes. An empty vector was used to correct for autofluorescence. Conversely, a construct that comprised of a RBS CheZ Venus (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537013">BBa_K537013</A>) was used as a positive control. Fluorescent data for the 3D plots (Fig 1-4) were corrected for autofluorescence by subtracting the fluorescent values of the cultures transformed with the empty vector, from that of the riboswitches.

</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Both the theophylline riboswitches displayed activation in response to increasing theophylline concentrations and incubation times. Theophylline riboswitch 2 controlling CheZ-Venus expression (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537012">BBa_K537012</A>) clearly showed a superior level of activation compared to that theophylline-controlled riboswitch 1 (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537011">BBa_K537011</A>). This was expected as it was selected by FACS for its optimised expression platform that allows for minimal leakiness at basal levels, and a strong activation in the presence of theophylline (Lynch and Gallivan, 2009).  The activation shown by both the riboswitches regulating CheZ-Venus expression should be able to restore the motility of <I>E. coli</I> cells deficient in CheZ, in the presence of theophylline. More importantly, the theophylline concentration-dependent increase in CheZ-Venus expression alludes to the ability of directed cell movement, that is moving up concentration gradients of theophylline (Topp and Gallivan, 2007). Interestingly, the data suggests that the presence of the CheZ gene, as part of the CheZ-Venus fusion sequence, enhances the activation of the switches when compared to the constructs with venus alone. This may be due to some sort of structural stability conferred by the presence of the CheZ sequence.</P><H2>Atrazine Riboswitch</H2><P>Preliminary activation data was obtained for the atrazine riboswitch.Fluorometry was performed on <I>E. coli</I> (DH5a) cells transformed with a construct that contained a Atrazine Riboswitch mRFP(<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537014">BBa_K537014</A>). Similar to the theophylline riboswitches, different concentrations  (0 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, 2 mM) of atrazine were added to the cultures for induction. The cultures were excited at 584 nm and detected at 607 nm using a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer. Readings were taken every 15 minutes for 120 minutes in total. The same empty vector was used as a negative control. The 3D plot data was normalised the same way as for the theophylline riboswitches.</P><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><B>Figure 5:</B> The fluorescence of the mRFP1 reporter protein under the regulation of the atrazine riboswitch(<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537014">BBa_K537014</A>) construct. <B>A)</B> The activation of the atrazine riboswitch at different atrazine concentrations over time.

On the semi-solid agar plates containing theophylline, the motility of <I>E.coli</I> is evident, as the interaction of theophylline with the riboswitch enables the exposure of the RBS and the translation of the downstream CheZ, allowing for bacterial motility. The distance travelled by the bacteria transformed with the Riboswitch 1 CheZ Venus construct, from the start position (mm) in the presence of different concentrations of theophylline, is not significantly different (P=0.005). This indicates that the CheZ expression at 0.5 mM-1.5 mM is sufficient to allow the bacteria to move a distance of 5 mm. The construct Riboswitch 2 CheZ Venus transformed into the CheZ deletion mutants are slightly motile in the absence of theophylline, travelling 2mm over a 24 hour period indicating that this riboswitch is slightly leaky. Upon addition of 0.5 mM-1.5 mM theophylline, the bacteria were able to travel 20mm over a 24 hour period.</P><P>The distance travelled from the start position by the CheZ deletion mutants containing the Riboswitch 2 CheZ Venus construct is significantly higher than that those with the Riboswitch 1 CheZ Venus construct. This can be explained by the high fold-increase in CheZ protein expression by this riboswitch, as shown by fluorometry (46-fold higher compared to 8-fold higher). Theophylline riboswitch 1 has a lower fold increase in CheZ expression from 0 mM to 1.5 mM theophylline, compared to the increase shown by the theophylline riboswitch 2. Therefore, in order to achieve maximum motility under the control of theophylline, at concentrations of between 0.5 mM and 1.5 mM, theophylline riboswitch 2 should be used.</P><H2>References

<P>Both the Riboswitch 1 Venus and Riboswitch 2 Venus constructs transformed into the ΔCheZ mutant <I>E.coli</I> are non-motile, each having travelled a distance of 0mm at all concentrations of theophylline (See A and B). This indicates that in the absence of the CheZ protein, the bacteria are non-motile (Topps and Gallivan, 2007).</P><A href="#Top">Back to top</A><DIV data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane" data-dojo-props="title:'Chemotaxis assay'"><P>In order to determine whether we had successfully engineered the <I>E. coli</I> CheZ deletion mutants to chemotactically migrate towards theophylline, we performed a capillary assay. Bacteria transformed with Riboswitch 1 Venus (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537009">BBa_K537009</A>), Riboswitch 2 Venus (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537010">BBa_K537010</A>), RBS CheZ Venus (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537013">BBa_K537013</A>), Riboswitch 1 CheZ Venus (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537011">BBa_K537011</A>) and Riboswitch 2 CheZ Venus (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K537012">BBa_K537012</A>) were grown to mid-log phase. Activation of chemotaxis was achieved by incubating the cultures with 1 mM theophylline prior to the assay. A 50 µl drop of each culture was then placed onto separate sterile surfaces and two capillary tubes were placed into each drop. The first capillary tube was a control, containing only PBS and 20 µM EDTA. The second tube contained PBS, 20 µM and 2mM theophylline. The two capillary tubes were suspended into each drop of culture for 30 minutes. A dilution series of the solutions in the tubes were plated and colonies counted after 12 hours. Further details of this protocol can be found <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/igem.org/a/ac/Capillary_assay_Protocol.pdf">here</A>.

This proves that none of these constructs induce chemotactic behaviour.  In terms of both Riboswitch 1 Venus and Riboswitch 2 Venus, the lack of CheZ results in the inability of CheY dephosphorylation and the swimming motion observed in chemotaxis, which is a key driver in directed movement towards an attractant (Topps and Gallivan, 2007). Although the RBS CheZ Venus construct constitutively expresses CheZ, and bacterial swimming is achieved through CheY dephosphorylation, the expression levels remain constant regardless of the presence or absence of theophylline.  Random movement will occur as a result.</P><P>The Riboswitch 1 CheZ Venus and Riboswitch 2 CheZ Venus transformants, with chemotaxis indices of 230 and 175 respectively, both indicated a significantly higher number of bacteria that travelled to the 2mM theophylline solution in the capillary tube compared to that of the control. </P><H2>References</H2>
