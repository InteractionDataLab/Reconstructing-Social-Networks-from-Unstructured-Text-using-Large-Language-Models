                                    During the 17th century, the advent of the light microscope allowed scientists to
                                    observe “tiny particles” that were proposed to be living due to their seemingly
                                    purposeful motion (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). It was only in the 19th century
                                    when these directed bacterial movements were first characterised by Wilhelm Pfeffer
                                    (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). Pfeffer’s work described the ability of bacteria to
                                    navigate through complex environments, in response to changes in temperature (thermotaxis),
                                    osmolarity (osmotaxis), light (phototaxis) and chemical substrates (chemotaxis)
                                    (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).</P><P>
                                    Bacterial chemotaxis is a regulated response that involves the processing of chemical
                                    substrates as input signals, into physical movements that result in bacterial motility
                                    (Topp and Gallivan 2007). This response allows for bacteria to selectively move
                                    along chemical gradients (Vladimirov, Lebiedz et al. 2010) (Fig 1), directing them
                                    towards substances that are favourable to their survival, and away from noxious
                                    substances (Adler 1975). Therefore, chemotaxis confers an important survival advantage
                                    to bacteria, particularly in their natural, non-mixed environment in which chemical
                                    gradients exist (Adler 1975; Vladimirov, Lebiedz et al. 2010).</P><P>

                                    Motile bacteria are endowed with flagella, which are long, helical projections that
                                    are anchored to the cell surface (Adler 1975) (Fig 2). At the base of the flagella,
                                    there is a rotary motor that is powered by the electrochemical energy that is generated
                                    by a transmembrane ion flux (Berg 2003; Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). This motor
                                    device induces reversible rotation of the flagella, which serves as the impetus
                                    for bacterial cell propulsion (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). In the well studied
                                    E. coli, there is an array of flagella at one pole of the cell that function collectively
                                    to induce cell motility (Berg 2003). During the course of its movement, two types
                                    of motions are exhibited: running and tumbling.
                                    Running is associated with the flagella rotating in a counter-clockwise direction,
                                    forming a bundle that works to propel the cell forward in a directed manner. Alternatively,
                                    tumbling is the result of the flagella rotating in a clockwise direction, disrupting
                                    the flagella bundle and causing the bacterial cell to fall in solution (Fig 3).
                                    This allows for the cell to re-orientate itself and for the direction of its runs
                                    to be changed, if deemed necessary. The frequency of each of these two motions varies,
                                    depending on the environmental signals that are transduced to the flagella motors.
                                    Chemotactic bacteria are able to make spatial as well as temporal comparisons of
                                    the concentration of the substance that they encounter, allowing them to regulate
                                    their motion in response to an increasing or decreasing concentration gradient (Adler
                                    1975). In the event that the bacterial cell is moving towards an attractant or away
                                    from a repellent, the movement is direct and is characterised by longer runs and
                                    fewer tumbles. However, in a uniform environment, the two motions alternate in such
                                    a way that the cell moves in a random walk (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).

                                    Adler and colleagues were the first to describe the intracellular signal transduction
                                    network involved in chemotaxis that is responsible for the relay of information
                                    from the environment, through the cell and to the flagella motor proteins (Baker,
                                    Wolanin et al. 2006). This led on to the elucidation of the existence and the function
                                    of a group of proteins that are responsible for this intracellular signalling known
                                    as the Che proteins (Fig 4).</P><P>

                                    between a ligand and a bacterial chemoreceptor. E. coli has five types of transmembrane
                                    chemoreceptors that exist as large polar clusters (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006; Topp
                                    and Gallivan 2007). These receptor proteins have highly variable periplasmic domains,
                                    allowing E. coli cells to respond to over 30 different compounds even with a minimal
                                    number of receptor types (Adler 1975; Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). The intracellular
                                    domain, on the other hand, is highly conserved and provides the scaffolding for
                                    the intracellular membrane associated Che protein complex. CheW directly binds to
                                    these conserved regions of the chemoreceptor to serve as an adapter between the
                                    chemoreceptor and the CheA protein, to form the intracellular Che protein complex
                                    (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).

                                    CheA is a large and complex histidine kinase that is able to phosphorylate its own
                                    histidine residues, using ATP as its substrate. This autophosphorylation of CheA
                                    results in the phosphorylation of CheY, which is a monomeric protein that is usually
                                    bound to CheA. Phospho-CheY (p-CheY) has a decreased affinity for CheA, resulting
                                    in its dissociation from the membrane associated Che protein complex. In this unbound
                                    state, p-CheY rapidly diffuses to the flagella switch proteins (FliM) and functions
                                    as an allosteric regulator to induce clockwise rotation of the flagella. The overall
                                    affect is the tumbling of the bacterial cell (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006; Topp and
                                    Gallivan 2007). This process is the native state of the system and occurs without
                                    chemoreceptor stimulation. However, when the bacterial cell encounters an attractant
                                    or a repellent that binds to a specific chemoreceptor, a ligand-induced conformational
                                    change occurs in the chemoreceptor. These changes may include piston-like movements
                                    and rotation of the receptor protein, which serves as the signal to the intracellular
                                    Che protein complex (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). This inhibits the kinase activity
                                    of the CheA protein, which will abrogate the production of p-CheY. Flagella motor
                                    proteins, in the absence of p-CheY regulation, produce counter clockwise flagella
                                    movements which result in directed bacterial swimming (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).</P></DIV><DIV data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane" data-dojo-props="title:'Regulation of Chemotaxis'"><P>
                                    The complexity of the signal transduction network that is responsible for chemotaxis
                                    lies within the mechanisms of its regulation. Factors that regulate the intracellular
                                    p-CheY concentration dictate the motion of the flagella and ultimately, the movement
                                    of the bacterial cell (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006). p-CheY concentrations are regulated
                                    by transmembrane signals that modulate the kinase activity of CheA. However, there
                                    are other Che proteins that are peripheral to the main signalling cascade that can
                                    also regulate the p-CheY concentration.

                                    CheR and CheB are methyl transferases and demethylases, respectively (Baker, Wolanin
                                    et al. 2006). They are responsible for the methylation state of the cytoplasmic
                                    domain of the chemoreceptors. Methylation of the chemoreceptor induces clockwise
                                    rotation of the flagella, whereas demethylation causes counter-clockwise rotation
                                    (Eisenbach 2001). This is thought to occur via conformational changes of the chemoreceptor
                                    as a result of methylation or demethylation (Eisenbach 2001). The state of methylation
                                    of the receptor is important as it modifies the sensitivity of the chemoreceptor,
                                    to prevent sensory saturation as the bacteria travel towards higher or lower concentrations
                                    (Sourjik 2004). Moreover, it provides a mechanism of short term memory, allowing
                                    for temporal comparisons of the stimulant concentration (Baker, Wolanin et al. 2006).</P><P>
                                    Another protein that can regulate bacterial chemotaxis is CheZ. This is a phosphatase
                                    that dephosphorylates p-CheY, freeing it from the flagella FliM protein and restoring
                                    the counter clockwise rotation of the flagella to elicit running (Topp and Gallivan
                                    2007). Therefore, CheZ influences the intracellular concentration of p-CheY directly,
                                    and is capable of modulating the motion that the bacterial chemotaxis.</P></DIV><DIV data-dojo-type="dijit.TitlePane" data-dojo-props="title:'References'"><P>
