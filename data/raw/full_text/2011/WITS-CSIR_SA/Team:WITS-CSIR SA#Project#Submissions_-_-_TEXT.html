What are biological parts?
Biological parts are genetic sequences that can be ligated into plasmids enabling prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells to perform a new function, or to optimize a specific pathway already existing within the cell. Some such parts include promoters, gene sequences and terminators. If all of the aforementioned components are present in a plasmid, it is termed a device.
Parts submitted
No parts have been submitted at this stage of the competition. Only once rigorous testing has been performed in the lab will we submit our parts.
