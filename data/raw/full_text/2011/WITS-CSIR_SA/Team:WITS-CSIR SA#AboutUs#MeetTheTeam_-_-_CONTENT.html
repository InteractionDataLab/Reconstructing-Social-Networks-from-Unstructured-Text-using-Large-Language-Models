He then held research positions at University College London, Ghent University and the Dutch research organization TNO. He returned to South Africa after accepting a faculty position at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg in 2009. He thinks iGEM is an awesome experience and that the team is so fortunate to be in it for the second time. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" class="pretty"><TBODY><TR><TH width="20%">

An associate professor of the University of the Witwatersrand, Marco works within the Antiviral Gene Therapy Research Unit and became entangled with the iGEM competition quite by accident. He has been one of the team faculty advisors for the past two years, working closely with the biology students in particular. He believes that it is important to push the team members to approach their project with scientific rigour and a strong work ethic, but also to remind them of the importance of being imaginative, and to inspire them to actively enjoy the experience of working in such a stimulating and creative environment. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" class="pretty"><TBODY><TR><TH width="20%">
