Future work & Application
In the future our first effort will be to optimize the lysis module such that the Dpn enzymes are efficiently exploited by the synthetic microbes to eradicate its genetic material in a non-native environment.  On top of this, UNIST team will also introduce more controlled system into E.coli so that it can be more safe to the environment and easy to be handled in the laboratory. We would like to introduce the following components into our Chop. coli in order to achieve our goal;
Second light receptor  &  Quorum Sensing System
Two light signals before lysis would help in providing a more tight control and ensure that the device would still work even when one of them is mutated.Our team  will also introduce a fourth sensing module to the Chop. coli using the quorum sensing system. In case of fermentor E. coli will experience its native original quorum sensing molecule, AI2  UNIST team is going to make that engineer E.coli to recognize  different quorum sensing molecules such as AHL to differentiate between the fermentor and the real world. This system will also help achieve an effective and tight control of lysis device.
With this approach it is also possible to create artificial cell
membrane for the transplantation of synthetic genome.
