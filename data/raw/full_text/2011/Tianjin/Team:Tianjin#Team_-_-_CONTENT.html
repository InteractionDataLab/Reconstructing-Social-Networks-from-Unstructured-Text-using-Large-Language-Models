We are going to change what we can change to the world, to make it more peaceful and prosperous. We are going to bring what we can bring into the game, like our undergraduates' enthusiasm and creativity. Come on and join us! And we are also coming up to U~!</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="MZbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG> Jul. 24th, 1990<STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG> Shandong Province, P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Experimen, Note<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG> Music and all kinds of instruments <STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG> In my opinion, synthetic biology is a different and magical field of science. It looks like mysterious at the first glance. But everything has changed as time goes by. As a member of IGEM working on our project for half a year, I have deeply understandings on it. Perhaps it will become an important memory during my undergraduate, an unforgettable experience that I devote my time, passion and intelligence to. I always wish I can search the future and through IGEM, I think I’ve done it.</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="JGbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG> Jan. 17th, 1990<STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG> Henan Province, P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Experiment, Modeling<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG> Table Tennis, Basketball, Reading <STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG> I think synthetic biology and system biology will be the future of chemical engineering. And I think we should explore the area of synthetic biology with “conception”. In this year’s project, what we focus on is about the industrial process and I think it’s very real, practical and impressive. At the beginning of this year’s project, I’m sure that what we are going to do will bring profit and outstanding result. I love iGEM and synthetic biology and system biology.</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="WKbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG> Dec. 1st, 1989<STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG> Hunan Province, P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Experiment<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG> Playing basketball and tennis, drawing, reading, searching on the Internet, listening some classical songs and so on<STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG>  I’m a clever and vivacious boy. Humor and laughter are particularly essential in my life. I love anything looks pretty and charming, such as the sunrise when I stand on top of a mountain, seeing the sun rising from the horizon slowly. To find the beauty in every detail is to embellish the life with whole passion, which is my favorite world.</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="YRbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG>Oct. 22th, 1990 <STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG>Hubei province,P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Wiki Programming<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG>Playing table-tennis and computer games such as DOTA. <STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG>I like things which are funny and innovative,and that's why I joined iGEM.Sometimes can be very persistent on thins.Biology is my favourite subject,and I have a dream that my country's Bio-economy can reach as USA's height.Believe that I can reach it if working hard. </DIV><DIV class="bio" id="AWbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG> Mar. 12th, 1994<STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG> Beijing, P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Wiki design, PowerPoint art design, Poster art design, Participate in experiment<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG> Piano, Table-Tennis, Tennis, SF Movie, All kinds of Music, Animation, Manga, Painting, Roller-Skating, Skiing, Photoshop, DotA.<STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG> I'm the youngest member of the team, and maybe the youngest one in my grade. So, I don't have many knowledge in the experiment part. But I have a lot in the art design part. And for I'm younger, I got more time to learn! This is the first year I participate in this igem team, and there are really little I can help. So, I hope to do more for this team next year.</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="QWbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG> Sept. 12th, 1990<STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG> Chongqing, P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Chemical Engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Presentation<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG> Jogging, Swimming, Language<STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG> Since the emergence of genetically engineered biology, the world has been realizing its significance day by day; and I developed interests in the field since my college years. Our team, dedicated to the better utilization of iGEM, offered me a place to use what I learn and contribute to what I cared. Our project concentrates on the vital procedure of fermentation, and our technology will lead to the optimization of the whole industry. I am confident in our career and hold great confidence in the development of synthetic engineering. This new technology of chemical engineering will definitely reshape the world. </DIV><DIV class="bio" id="HRbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG> Sept. 30,1990<STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG> Tianjin, P.R.China<STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Chemical Engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Experiment<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG> Table tennis<STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG> A boy with innocent curiosity to the nature and universe.</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="EWbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG><STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG><STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Experiment<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG><STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG></DIV><DIV class="bio" id="LCbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG><STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG><STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Bio-engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Experiment<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG><STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG></DIV><DIV class="bio" id="DTbio"><STRONG>Birthday:</STRONG><STRONG>Hometown:</STRONG><STRONG>Discipline:</STRONG> Software Engineering<STRONG>Role:</STRONG> Wiki Programming<STRONG>Interests:</STRONG><STRONG>Self-description:</STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
