This page shows a list of all the parts that we have made or used in the project. Click on each link to see more details about that part on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . As our project focus on tor2 gene coming from yeast and contains common restriction sites like EcoRI, NotI and SpeI, the stantard Plasmid Backbone and BioBrick prefix/suffix is no longer appropriate. Furthermore, the size of 7800bp makes it pretty too expensive and inconvenient for chemical synthesis and codon optimization to avoid certain restriction sites. To match with the core gene and protein, a series of parts also give up standard prefix/suffix and backbones. We have used at least 3 kinds of plasmids, including blunt-end vectors to Yeast Surface Display Vector. However, based on the splendid standard plasmid backbone pSB1C3, which has a small size and simple MCS for easy-operation, we modified several vectors, which also render functionality and ease-of-use of promoter parts.
1.  Inducible pCIT2 – Mut-TOR2 - Terminator, BBa_K563061: Promoter of CIT2 gene would be binding with transcription factor RTG1/3 at the presence of FAP. Then our reconstructed Mut-TOR2 would be expressed and forms in Mut-TORC1 which is not allergic to FAP. The accumulation of Mut-TORC1 will help the intracellular phosphorylation back to normal state. 2.  pYE- Reporter, BBa_K563040 ~ BBa_K563046: We have successfully construct vectors, which coding bright fluorescent protein and Luciferase and beta-galactosidase in yeast cell. This series of BioBricks provide a convenient method for the measurement and detection of gene expression and terminate the unsuccessful expression of fluorescent protein in yeast cell. 3.  Modified Plasmid Backbone – pSBY11, BBa_K563051: We reconstruct the Yeast Vector pYD through the combination with pSB1A11. According to specific primers, we amplify the yeast elements (CEN4/ARS6, TRP1 orf and terminator region) by PCR, and then insert the fragment into pSB1A11 by single restriction site PstI. In this way, a modified vector that combines pYD and pSB1A11 together(pSBY1) for large fragment transformation between yeast and E. coli is built.
