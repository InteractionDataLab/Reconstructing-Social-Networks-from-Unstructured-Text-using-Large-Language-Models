Our major experiments are manipulated by team members in Tianjin 2011iGEM. Most of them are undergraduates from discipline of Biological Engineering and Chemical Engineering. While some professors and post-graduates in School of Chemical Engineering and Technology have provided significant support from the very beginning of the project design. Besides, we got help on art design and website creation from undergraduate in School of Software, and some friends not in our university. Some of them didn’t even meet us before. Our achievement won’t exist without all the support. Best regards and undying gratitude to every one of you!

In the 2011 China Meetup @USTC, about 20 teams from China mainland and Taiwan District got together to share and discuss projects and new ideas. We could see different perspectives of synthetic biology through varied projects.
From Ribo/toggle switch to condon optimum, from chemotaxis to quorum system, from pollution control to construction of functional modules, the enthusiasm from youth and creativity from undergraduates filled the auditorium with joy and wisdom.
iGEM always encourage cooperation and collaborations between universities for better scientific communication and deeper comprehension of Synthetic Biology. This year, our university agreed on helping NYMU with the plasmid transformation and growth curve measurement. This cooperation would bring mutual benefits to both our universities, not only for academic research, but also for the long lasting friendship.
