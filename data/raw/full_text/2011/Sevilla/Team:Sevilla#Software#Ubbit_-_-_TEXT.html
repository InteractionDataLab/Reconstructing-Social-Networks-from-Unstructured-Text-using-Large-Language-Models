Ubbit repository
The Ubbit repository is a web database  developed to facilitate the implementation of the Ubbit standard. The repository is in a very early stage of its development, so we are launching it today in a pre-alpha release .
The main functionalities of the database are:
Add your own wires, and logical cores. Let's make the repository grow!
Search over other researchers' resources.
A friendly interface, more atractive and easier to use than other biological databases.
Over the following days you will be able to see it in action in Ubbit.org or here .
The future of Ubbit.com
We will continue developing the repository, adding new features, like the module section and user management. If you think of a new feature for the repository, don't hesitate to contact us, you have the forum below. Or you can just send us an email to contacto@arcanumproject.com , follow us in Twitter or look for us in Facebook
