Our inoculums look pleasantly cloudy, as expected. All except two. We freeze samples
of the good ones in glycerol at -80 ºC in a wonderful fridge that could also easily house 
a corpse (who knows?).</P><P>
We start studying the protocols of our mini-prep kit to purify the BioBrick plasmids
from our transformed cultures. They don't look that complicated but we have to do
about 50; shoulders to the wheel!
</P><P>
We receive several BioBricks and the strains we had ordered: vainillin and rhlR
BioBricks, two strains of B.subtilis, another strain containing VanM/N genes... people
are being quite kind to us! We seed the bacteria and transform them with the BioBricks,
depending on the format they come in.</P><P>
Our mini-preps are ready at last after a hard day’s work, and we are able to leave some
inoculums of DH5-a to prepare competent cells tomorrow.</P><P>
21.30: Lab OFF.

Materials and chemicals keep appearing in big cardboard boxes full of styro-foam
pieces (we're storing it all in the hopes of filling a bath next month and having some
fun).

</P><P>
More good news: our transformed cultures have grown as expected, as have the B.
subtilis strains. At the end of the day we make inoculums of them all so that they grow
o/n and tomorrow we can freeze samples and do yet more mini-preps (we have only just
started and we're already sick and tired of that kit...)

</P><P>
We need to discuss which assembling method we'll use with the BioBricks. It takes
us some hours, and in the meantime, Andrés faces the personal challenge of making
competent cells from the DH5-a inoculum with the new protocol. Tomorrow we'll see
who has won the battle...

</P><P>
And Pedro isn't wasting any time at all, he's just found out these racks are stackable, like
Lego. This discovery has changed his life, look how happy he is!

</P><P>
After deciding how we'll build each BioBrick, and counting all the ligations we need to
do, we finally tackle the digestions with the different restriction enzymes. Mastermix
kits this time. More protocols. GREAT.

AT LAST our official mascot is here! Say hello to Mr. Gibbs! Rocío had him held
captive in her house, but to make up for that, she's brought a WONDERFUL Disney
princess clock to cheer our lab up! It gives the lab that homely touch. We have also
brought a coffee machine - we need caffeine in industrial amounts to work here for so
many hours a day.
</P><P>
More mini-preps and frozen samples. But we're also trying something new! Our first
electrophoresis to see how the digestions and the mini-preps go. We're examining the
results. It's ok for the first time, but there's a long way to go yet...
</P><P>
Marta is in charge of our first ligations, tomorrow we'll see how they went.</P><P>
...and how did the great battle end? Andrés 1 -  E.coli 0. We have competent cells!
</P><P>
Out of the lab before 19.00. What a record!

We run an electrophoresis of the digestions we made yesterday, but it hasn't worked properly, it seems the process still needs some fine-tuning.
</P><P>
We spend some time preparing the rewards for those who gave us money for the project
through the crowd-funding platform. Letters, funny badges, videos...
</P><P>
Coffee break while we run one more electrophoresis...
</P><P>
We have a nice visit today! Lauren, from the team of Pennsylvania, is here to tell us
about her project, and learn a bit more about ours. Carlos is having an intense discussion
on kinetics with her while Marta struggles to design the primers we'll need for the PCR
reactions next week. There's no way to get them exactly right, what a nightmare!
