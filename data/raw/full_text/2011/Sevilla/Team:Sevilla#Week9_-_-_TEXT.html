Boring week
We won't bore you telling you about our continuous misfortunes. Just as a summary of the week: the boys are all studying for their exams, and us girls must admit this is a bit boring without them. But at least the organization is easier and it seems we're quite efficient - for now...we'll see when we get to the point of ligation and transformation.
Roberto and Pablo are working hard on the wiki and ubbit.org and they keep us company sometimes so that we don't go to pieces. Some of the rest of the boys come and go to see how we're doing when they have to come to the university for their exams. Hope they're doing better than us...
This is ab-so-lu-te-ly frustrating.
