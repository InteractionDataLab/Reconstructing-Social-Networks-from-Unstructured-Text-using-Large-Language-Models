The University of Seville is a public institution dedicated to higher education, located in Seville, in the autonomous region of Andalusia, in the south of Spain. Though its departments are scattered all over the city, the rectorship’s head-office is the Royal Tobacco Factory, downtown. Along with the University of Málaga, it’s the promoter of the project called Andalucía TECH, that got the category of International Excellence Campus awarded by the Spain Ministry of Education.  

The US has firmly supported us in the course of the development of the project both with enomomical help and providing us with the infrastructures needed.

US Students’ Vice-rectorship: thanks to their kind help we were able to pay many of the trips needed to launch our project.

Ministry of Science and Innovation: the Ministry’s support was a wonderful surprise for us. They heard of our project on the Internet, they liked it and promised to give us the same amount of money we gathered via crowdfunding. When we went to Madrid to present the project, they took us by surprise when the Minister herself, Cristina Garmendia, came to have an interview with us. It was broadcast by the main news channel of our country! Eventually, once we managed to gather money through crowdfunding, the Ministry kept its word, giving us the promised amount.

Eppendorf is one of the most important companies related to laboratories, which develops, produces and distributes systems for life-science research laboratories worldwide. They have given us the great majority of the material we needed and thanks to them we have been able to develop our project during this summer.

The principal purpose of the OTRI is to dynamize relationships between the uiversity and the scientific comunity, companies and others socio-conomic agents in order to  make the most of I+D capacities and scientific activity results of the University of Seville. Their collaboration has been essential to our project.

The Faculty of Computer Science is part of the University of Seville. They have undertaken the payment of the flights and traveling expenses of our two computer engineers.

The vice-rectorship for scientific research was probably the earliest sponsor, one of the first in believing in our project and supporting us. Thanks to their help we′ve been allowed to pay many bills, specially those related to the biochemistry compounds we've bought. Besides, their endorsement helped us to get more sponsors.

The Biology School offers two careers: degree in Biology and degree in Biochemistry. It's divided into two buildings: in the &quot;Green Building&quot; we find the library, the laboratories for the practicals - where we've been living for three months, and the differents departments where the teachers research and where we've received all the help we could need. In the second building, the &quot;Red&quot; one, is where we find the classrooms and the biggest computing room in the campus. We're really going to miss our &quot;Green House&quot;...
