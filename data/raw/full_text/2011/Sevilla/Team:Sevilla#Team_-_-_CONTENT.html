The original team was no more than a group of friends looking for an original idea about synthetic biology, but as this idea grew and took shape, it was clear that it could perfectly fit this competition. So the team recruited some other acquaintances and people interested in the project: biologists, biochemists, biotechnologists, computer engineers and advisors joined the group to build the definitive Arcanum Project Team.

And I found the great opportunity of developing our own project and our ideas.  We can’t miss that chance.

Who knows? Maybe what we’re doing today will be useful tomorrow for somebody to create even bigger, more complex biological machines. Working with such components might lead me to reconsider a thought I used to have: studying some kind of engineering. But that, apart from studying Physics and Chemistry before, will happen only if I win the lottery, or maybe if some great gentle patron contacts me thanks to this project... :) </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="roberto"><DIV class="title"><P>

Undecided between languages, medicine or maths, I eventually chose this new degree, which was apparently challenging and promised lots of further opportunities for research.</P><P>And what a great discovery! I can’t help but admire how all the different scientific branches intertwine, right down to the deepest element to form a whole that works just like a programmed clock. I was far from imagining to what extent we have managed to gain control over nature on so many levels, especially taking into account how unpredictable, and downright powerful Mother Nature still proves to be. And what’s better is how fascinating and erratic she is even nowadays. As each new year in my degree goes by I keep changing mind about what to do in the future; I guess I may have to keep studying for the rest of my life...</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="parra"><DIV class="title"><P>

Unlike the majority of the group, I’m studying Information Technology at the University of Seville, though when I came to make the final choice I was in serious doubt over which degree to do as Biology, Maths and Chemistry were also extremely appealing to me. So, when Pedro called me that evening to meet up and talk about the project they were involved with, I had no option but to give a categorical YES to his proposal of joining them. 
</P><P>
In the three or four months since I’ve learnt so much about different fields of Biology, such as Genetic Regulation; about management and about people that I otherwise wouldn’t have known. If participants are from the field of biology, they’ll find enterprising people with original ideas. Equally, if they’re from another specialism, they’ll benefit from teaming up with Biologists: if there’s one good thing about Synthetic Biology it is the fact that any project needs people from several disciplines. Four pairs of eyes can see better than two, especially if they are looking from different perspectives.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="marta"><DIV class="title"><P>

I was much older when I went to a conference about embryonic stem cells which featured Bernat Soria - a famous Spanish expert in stem cells – talking about their use for the treatment of diabetes, and at that moment I decided that I wanted to devote myself to the study of the smallest and most complex mechanisms found in life.</P><P>When I think that all  the living organisms that surround us have appeared because of thousands of years of evolution I can’t help feeling dizzy. And there are still so many things left to understand and discover that we will never finish learning. That’s why synthetic biology  is so awesome.. I am very proud to be able to contribute to the improvement of technology and further our knowledge in this field.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="carlos" class="hide"><DIV class="title"><P>

For some reason I decided to change my degree and nowadays I’m somewhere between the fourth and the fifth year of a/my Biology degree, and about to finish.</P><P>   From the very moment I began the degree I’ve thought about possible biotechnology projects which could help solve some of our species’ problems and recently I’ve realised that my mind is actually always working on the code of synthetic biology. So, I find it amazing to have this opportunity to participate in iGEM 2011, where we’ll show everybody there’s still such a lot to do. My favourite part of the about the Ubbit Standard project  is the theoretical development of the basis of the standard, and the rules governing the new levels of abstraction. I think the Ubbit Standard has a promising future far beyond the contest and we will be able to promote it as it deserves.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="pedro"><DIV class="title"><P>

And I don’t mean complex as in difficult to understand, but as in how vast the subject is. I’ve often thought how fascinating it must have been to be a scientist 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago, when all the great findings we now take for granted were still undiscovered. Even though we’re clarifying our basis of knowledge little by little - which means becoming more and more specialized - biology still offers a huge amount of challenges to undertake. I think that’s the reason I know researching biology is my vocation, the sheer size of the subject matter and something which occurred naturally – by chance - on our planet.</P>

to the North of the world, to Norway, and did my PhD on human misfolding diseases.
