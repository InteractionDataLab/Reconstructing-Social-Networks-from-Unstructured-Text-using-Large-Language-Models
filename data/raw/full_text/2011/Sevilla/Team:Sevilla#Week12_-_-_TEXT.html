From the lab to the Regional Jamboree...
We've come to the end though we thought this day would never come. Everything's ready for the Jamboree, we're looking forward to it!
It's been a pleasure to share all our fortunes and misfortunes with you guys, but it's time for a long, well-deserved rest after the Jamboree! But not so long actually: university's already started. But this has been a very enjoyable experience, we've learnt a lot and  had real fun. We'll have to think whether we continue with this next year, but not now: let us think about something different than the parts registry. We'll have nightmares for weeks
