God, we're about to burst. We've slogged our guts out this weekend. Some things have worked,some others haven't, but it's all done now. Let's go get some sleep and we'll think of the wiki later. There's still a lot of work to do, but it's impossible to carry it out in these conditions...
Tuesday 20 September
One of the constructions we asked for has arrived today. Isn't it wonderful? So much for punctuality...
Here we are in the lab, laptops invading the work benches and everybody translating, completing sections, adding pictures, sponsors, etc.
Wednesday 21 September
Final touches, pictures,logos and everything to round off the wiki. Hope somebody bothers to read it, because it's actually quite complete, entertaining, easy-readable, and cost us so much effort...
The design for our t-shirts is almost finished. Inés is doing a great work, we hope they'll be ready for next week.
Rocío is investigating about some new techiques to make our presentation more dynamic and elegant. It looks great, but we still have to work on the contents.
We still have to fill some important forms for the Jamboree...
3.00 a.m. Still in the lab...but hopefully we'll be out of here soon
Wednesday Protocols

Thursday 22 September
Given the fact that we're still in the lab at 3.30 am, tomorrow we probably won't be working hard on the presentation and the poster until the evening. But we must do it, we're falling behind!
Friday 23 September
Time to tide up the lab! We'll have to think what to do with all the material we have left. We don't even want to imagine this situation, it will be such a emotional moment, when we close this door for the last time, after three months living here... [sigh]
