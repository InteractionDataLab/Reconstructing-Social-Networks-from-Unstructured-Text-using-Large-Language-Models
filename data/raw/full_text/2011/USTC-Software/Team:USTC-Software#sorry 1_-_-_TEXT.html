Sorry
我怀念，别怀念。怀念也回不到从前。
白月光、心里某个地方。
那么亮、却那么冰凉。
你是我、不能言说的伤。
想遗忘、 又忍不住回想。
像流亡、 一路跌跌撞撞。

谁拿流年乱了浮生，又借浮生乱了红尘。
清晨，我们微笑出发。
正午，我们在原地绕圈圈，坚强地保持风度。
黄昏，我们看到相同的风景及日落。
夜晚，我们安慰自己，相信努力没白费。

如果我爱上你的笑容 要怎么收藏要怎么拥有
时光就像是模糊工具。
一点点,朦胧了视线。
看不清晰、再减淡。
融化成光、直至空白。

Welcome to    University of Science and Technology of China  !

Chinese teams began to participate  International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition from 2007. The number of Chinese teams has increased to 20 from only 4 at the beginning.    Considering that the new teams are lack of experience in the 2011 competition and a platform for communication and cooperation between teams is badly needed,    a meeting for all Chinese iGEMers -- iGEM 2011 China Meetup -- was held at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th.
The theme of this conference is "iGEM -- the breeding ground for the next generation of synthetic biologists". During the conference,    well-known experts was invited to promulgate their latest research findings and elucidate the development trend of synthetic biology,    and there were also  insightful students to make subjective reports and reviews. iGEM teams  displayed the current progress of their projects,    and shared their experiences with conference participants.
Prof. Xueming Zhao from Tianjin University, Prof. Michael Q. Zhang from CSHL & Tsinghua University and Prof. Jiarui Wu from SIBS & USTC were invited to give lectures.   The conference was open to all undergraduates, graduate students and researchers who are interested in iGEM and synthetic biology. Participants interacted with each other and the lecturers during the conference.    The conference is supported by School of Life Science, USTC and the Committee of Communist Youth League of China, USTC.
