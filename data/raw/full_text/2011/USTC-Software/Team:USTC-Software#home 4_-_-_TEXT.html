What is iGEM?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.

Where are we from?
The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) is under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).                  As a key university of the nation, it is noted for its advanced science and high technology programs, unique management studies and well-tailored disciplines in the humanities.                  On May 11, the Nature Publishing Group released Nature Publishing Index 2010 China, remarking "a dramatic rise in the quality of research being published by China". University of Science and Technology of China is ranked 3rd of TOP 10 Institutions in Index 2010 China.

Nothing gets done by itself so we formed a group of tireless and diligent students came from different faculties (all parts of USTC) and joined our forces at School of Life Sciences.

Project
USTC 2011 DRY TEAM as a one has worked diligently on designing and implementing a user friendly and interacting-prone software which will get nearer to biology reality and free synthetic biologist from considering unnecessary minutia as well as help both layman and expert draw deep understanding of the mechanism on how the gene circuit run.
We offer a visualizing tool which give insight into the dynamics of a biology network. User dominated parameter adjustment process is also provided to assist in getting the required behavior. In order to assess the network’s immunology to parameter perturbation, a PCA analysis approach is exploited to depict the structure of a 'good' behaved region.
