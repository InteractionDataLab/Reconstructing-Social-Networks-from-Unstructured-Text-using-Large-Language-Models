Behavior view
Visualize network behavior using graphs and tables
Starting Definition
The line editors above are used to determine several global parameters.After it's done, the time course table below is formed.
Inputing Data
Fill the table to specify the exact behavior using values.Each of them means the concentration of a certain substance at a certain time.You can also specify each node of substance by changing its name and color (the color will represent the node in the next view).
Plotting
Switch the tab back and you'll get something like this:
Generating Values
Also you can generate values of the concentrations by drawing rough curves like this:
remember each time you finished a curve,press the button "generate value" and that means the curve take effect.
Switch the tab back and you'll get something like this:
