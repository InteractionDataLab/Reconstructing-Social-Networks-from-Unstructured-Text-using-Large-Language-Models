No iGEM project is done in a day. It requires good team work for 12 months to achieve it.  USTC-Software team is built up by 9 student members (5 undergraduates, 4 graduates), 6 instructors and 2 advisors. Throughout the summer of 2011, our team members have been working cooperatively with our instructors to realize the idea of Lachesis. We also appreciate the help from numerous people caring about USTC-Software team.  Our thank goes to all the listed and unlisted names on the acknowledgements page .  Details about each team member's work are listed below:
Haiyan Liu(Advisor)
Provide instructive suggestion on our project design.
Jiarui Wu(Advisor)
Contribute to education of synthetic biology.
Jiong Hong(Instructor)
Primary contact of team USTC-Software, help team building, explain basic biology concepts.
Hao Jiang(Instructor)
Contribute by providing suggestions and answering questions about concepts in synthetic biology, software needed in this field, visualization of parts assembly and reaction network dynamics, tricks in parameter estimation, etc.
Wei Pan(Instructor)
Contribute in the development of the original idea: combining forward and reverse engineering together. Instruct on robustness and sensitivity analysis, help team members in learning Automatic Biological Circuit Design (ABCD) and explain basic biological concepts.
Zhen Wang(Instructor)
Contribute in the development of the original idea: combining forward and reverse engineering together, and help team members in learning iGAME and basic biological concepts.
Chen Liao(Instructor)
Rewrites the core codes of iGaME with perl and that codes have been incorporated into Lechesis.
Kun Jiang(Instructor)
Team building and training of software development.
