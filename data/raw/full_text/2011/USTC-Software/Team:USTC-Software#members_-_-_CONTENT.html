Joining in iGEM is a big event in my graduate life, I have learned much from group working, brainstorming. Cooperating and collaborating with other team members is an exciting thing. As the only girl in my team, I am very happy to get along with 8 talented boys, working together for the same target. In the team, I mainly work on the mathematic model to simulate biological reaction, and I am glad to see that mathematics can apply in the field of Synthetic biology.
In my spare time, I like travelling ,and I have a big dream to travel all around the world, collect all the beautiful scenery on the planet, and I am on my way to fulfill my dream,  wanna go with me?

       The best thing in iGEM  is that I could get to know many talented guys, I learned ways to go well with  the team, and team working is a good way to improve my ability for I can learn  much from my team members. In the game, we come across with a lot of things, bad  and good, it is an precious experience in our lives. In the team, I mainly work  on the design of the datatype of our software and give lectures as well as  raise ideas on our program, and I come to know a program is not only a  software. Heroism is not the best way of teamwork.
       In my spare time, I  like sporting, and I have a big dream to make the world more beautiful. I can't  fulfill this dream by myself , so is there anyone go with me?

       Being a  member of the team of USTC-software has always been an enjoyable time for me.  The DNA data I deal with in my daily research which used to be lifeless had  become vivid after learning the background knowledge from iGEM, and I have  learnt many useful programming tricks working with my team members. 
       In my team, I mainly work on the  statistical model to simulate biological reactions, and find the most sensitive  direction of the parameters of the systems of ordinary differential equations which describe  the dynamic state of the biochemistry system in the hyperspace.
       In my  spare time, I like watching movie, my favorite film maker is Tim Burton.
