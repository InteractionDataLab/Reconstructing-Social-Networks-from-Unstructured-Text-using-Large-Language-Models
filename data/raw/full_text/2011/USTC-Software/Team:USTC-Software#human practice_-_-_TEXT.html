Human Practice
I.  Survey
During the National Science week, we conducted a visiting activity aimed at letting more people know about synthetic biology. A survey was also done at the same time in order to get visitors’ thoughts about this field and issues about ethics, living creatures and the like.
The results of the survey were compiled and we've come to the following conclusion:
Considering our survey respondents includes undergraduates and graduates with different education backgrounds, it wasn't astonishing that 86% of them chose synthetic biology to be designing and constructing new biological functions and systems running on principles of biology as opposed to synthetically creating life.  38% of them also believed advances in synthetic biology will benefit human beings.
