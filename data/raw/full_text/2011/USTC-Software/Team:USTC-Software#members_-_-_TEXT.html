Hi, I'm Xudong Sun, a graduate student majoring in nano biophysics. All the wonders and mysteries in life sciences attract so I have changed my career from physics to biology.  Currently , my research field is nanobio detection and manipulation with SPM, MD simulation of biological systems.
My interests range from modelling and simulation, signal and image processing,coding,and electronic engineering. In my spare time, i am involved in all kinds of sports and interesting activities,all kinds of balls, swimming, dancing ,hiking and many more.
I like chatting with people and arranging things. I have learned much from the experence in iGEM of cooperating with people from different backgrounds. As the team leader,my major task in this project is  arranging the team affairs , investigating the fields we can do, writing the test codes of parameter analysis, discussing models and algorithms with other teammates and providing necessary biology background.
I hope everyone involved in iGEM can have fun, make more friends, learn more and enjoy yourself.

Hi, I'm Fangming(Charles) Liu, I'm a Junior student major in computer science. I'm interested in software engineering and programming languages. By attending the iGEM contest, i've further practised my skills and learned a lot from the members of our team. I've designed the main structure of the software and did some programming work during this spring and summer. I look forward to the day when pieces of software on this planet all cooperate together seamlessly and work as a whole. I'm glad to be your friend!

I am Zhuocheng He, a student from school of information science & technology USTC,majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
I joined USTC-software team because I am bored with Fourier.I regard IGEM as an opportunity to learn something other than xxFT,and I am satisfied with the outcome.
In the team,my job is constructing and maintaining the UI of Behavior View and Network View.

I am Ao Xu !   :)
I am a junior student majored in theory and applied mechanics.
As the boundaries among different disciplines of science are now blurring,             I want to handle the ideology of engineering to arrive at a higher standpoint to try to understand the principle of life.            iGEM, a Do-It-Yourself Genetic Engineering Program, provides us with such a good state to learn from utilization,            and I am strongly attracted by this idea and cannot help imaging the science fiction picture where our daily life is changed by our genetic machine.
In our team, I mainly design and construct our website, responsible for human practice, together with raise ideas about User Interface, summarize useful information from previous work.

I'am Junyuan (Eric) Xie, a Junior student of Univniversity of Science and Technology of China. My major is computer science and my research interest lies in Machine Learning and Data Mining. Besides, I'm also interested in programming and software development.
In this team, I'm responsible for coding and technical support. Specifically, I developed and maintained the interfaces between user, Lachesis and MoDeL. I have also given some help on the design and implementation of the parameter analysis algorithms. Now, I'm working with Xudong Sun to make a robust and easy-using software out of the parameter analysis algorithms.

Hi, I'm Liwei Qian, a graduate student majoring in computer science.
I like brainstorm and exchanging ideas with each other. Participating in USTC software team gives me a good opportunity to communicate and make friends with other team members.
In the team, I mainly work on parameter optimazation and model analysis. This is a classic problem in computer science and I'm interested in it.
In my spare time , I like to play pingpong and badminton. In summer, I always go to swimming with my friends and enjoy the feeling of cool.

Hi, I am Li Hui, I am a graduate student major in computational mathematics, and I also interested in biomathematics. Joining in iGEM is a big event in my graduate life, I have learned much from group working, brainstorming. Cooperating and collaborating with other team members is an exciting thing. As the only girl in my team, I am very happy to get along with 8 talented boys, working together for the same target. In the team, I mainly work on the mathematic model to simulate biological reaction, and I am glad to see that mathematics can apply in the field of Synthetic biology. In my spare time, I like travelling ,and I have a big dream to travel all around the world, collect all the beautiful scenery on the planet, and I am on my way to fulfill my dream,  wanna go with me?

Hey, I am An'gang  Wang, an undergraduate senior student majoring in Computer Science, yet biology  is my interesting field, that is why I join in iGEM.
The best thing in iGEM  is that I could get to know many talented guys, I learned ways to go well with  the team, and team working is a good way to improve my ability for I can learn  much from my team members. In the game, we come across with a lot of things, bad  and good, it is an precious experience in our lives. In the team, I mainly work on the design of the datatype of our software and give lectures as well as  raise ideas on our program, and I come to know a program is not only a  software. Heroism is not the best way of teamwork.
In my spare time, I  like sporting, and I have a big dream to make the world more beautiful. I can't  fulfill this dream by myself , so is there anyone go with me?

Hi, I am Qi Wang, a graduate student majored in biostatistics and machine learning.
Being a  member of the team of USTC-software has always been an enjoyable time for me.  The DNA data I deal with in my daily research which used to be lifeless had  become vivid after learning the background knowledge from iGEM, and I have  learnt many useful programming tricks working with my team members.
In my team, I mainly work on the  statistical model to simulate biological reactions, and find the most sensitive  direction of the parameters of the systems of ordinary differential equations which describe  the dynamic state of the biochemistry system in the hyperspace.
In my  spare time, I like watching movie, my favorite film maker is Tim Burton.
