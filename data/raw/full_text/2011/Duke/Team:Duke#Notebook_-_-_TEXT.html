May, 2011
We began coming up with ideas. We first read several papers to decide what some weak points in synthetic biology were.
Early June, 2011
We decided that synthetic biology should start focusing on next generation techniques and application based network to gain popularity for the field.
June 15, 2011
We read several articles about zinc finger proteins as DNA binding domains.
June 16, 2011
Chose how to apply zinc fingers in SynBio. We originally meant to use combinatorial libraries of zinc finger proteins and put randomized orders of binding sites in bacterial DNA.
June 17-June 25
Idea is developed further: We chose to study zinc fingers as synthetic transcription factors and decide to use the bacterial 2 hybrid assay to characterize.
July 4-August 1
Complete B2H and realize that it isn’t as successful as we hoped.
August 5, 2011
Back to the drawing board: How can we make characterization. Got IT! apply CPEC to B2H assay construction to get results quicker.
August 7th, 2011
We design the toggle switch controller and spend the next two months focusing on making CPEC fragments for synthesis de novo. We also collected characterization data for ZFs through protein docking and made stochastic models for our network.
