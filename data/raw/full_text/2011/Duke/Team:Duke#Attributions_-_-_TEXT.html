Instructions:Each team must clearly attribute work done by the team on this page.  They must distinguish work done by the team from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, graduate students, and postgraduate masters students.
Dr. Jingdong Tian - Supervising Professor
Aakash Indurkhya - Tested the Bacterial-2-Hybrid Assay with Peter. Modeled the network design in silico using the TinkerCell program to confirm network function. Ordered all primers. Used Molegro Virtual Docker for computational characterization of zinc finger transcription factors.
Peter Fan - Came up with the original 2-plasmid genetic toggle switch network design. Designed the two plasmids for use in the Genetic Toggle Switch Controller System. Tested the Bacterial-2-Hybrid Assay with Aakash. Also helped with in silico characterization of zinc finger transcription factors using the computational program molegro.
Alyssa Ferris - Constructed the zinc finger biobricks using the Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) method.
Diane Shao - Helped with miscellaneous lab work including parts of the Bacterial-2-Hybrid Assay as well as making plates and broth.
Kevin Chien - Advised High School Students - Helped with miscellaneous lab work including parts of the Bacterial-2-Hybrid Assay as well as making plates and broth.
Andrew Guo - Advised High School Students - Helped with miscellaneous lab work including parts of the Bacterial-2-Hybrid Assay as well as making plates and broth.
Andrew Ang - Advised High School Students - Helped with miscellaneous lab work including parts of the Bacterial-2-Hybrid Assay as well as making plates and broth.
