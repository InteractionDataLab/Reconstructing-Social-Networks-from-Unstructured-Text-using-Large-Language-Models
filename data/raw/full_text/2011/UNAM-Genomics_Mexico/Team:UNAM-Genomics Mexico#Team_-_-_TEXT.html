We study the Genomic Sciences Undergraduate Program at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Synthetic Biology is bliss and we are more than eager to share our passion for science. iGem is a great opportunity to design, create, and explore within Synthetic Biology (and sometimes beyond!); which is the reason we are all here. Our team is a mosaic of people where each of us has a major area of interest. Therefore we have split ourselves in different subproject teams, never forgetting the integrative approach needed for engineering. We hope you enjoy learning about our proyect as much as we enjoy doing it.
