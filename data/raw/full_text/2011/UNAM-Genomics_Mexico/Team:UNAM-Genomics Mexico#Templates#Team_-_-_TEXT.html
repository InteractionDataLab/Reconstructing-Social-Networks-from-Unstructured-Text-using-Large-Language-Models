UNAM-Genomics_Mexico presents:
Hydrobium etli
for iGEM competition 2011
Project
Hydrogen. The doubtful begining, the unreachable end. Our paths, both the one drawn in the    maps of our heads and the one awaiting our fall in reality, will be written here, with blood     and sweat, for other adventurers wishing to reach the border of what our knowledge lights.
The Rhizobium etli Work Kit
Arrows, bow, rope, shield, sword. The warrior relies heavily on his tools. This is why     trustworthy tools are not necessary but vital along the travel. The blacksmith is a hero    too. Here is his story.
Model
Wizard wisdom lights all heroes paths. The seers ability to overcome trouble beffore it    presents itself saves resources and lives. Being a step ahead can make the difference.
There are many kinds of wizards. Most of them lack the beard, the hat and the magic wand.    But you must not be deluded. They can be just as powerful. They are vital for any heroic    campaign.
Yes, wizards don't know it all. But who does?
Safety and Ethics
If while saving the princess you destroy the kingdom, you're no hero.
Human Practices
Little heroes save their princess. Big heroes save towns, cities or nations. Great heroes    save the people.
Our
This is how we changed along the path:
Our logbook (or the team's tale)
Our tools, and how they grew old with us
Our memories, imprinted in minds and bytes
Ourselves (as childs, teens, men and women)
Sponsors
Thank you Puss in Boots, thank you Tinker Bell, thank you Godmother
