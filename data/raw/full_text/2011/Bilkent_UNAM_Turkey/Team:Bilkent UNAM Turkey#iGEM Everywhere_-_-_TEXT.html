Team:Bilkent UNAM Turkey/iGEM Everywhere
From 2011.igem.org
A meeting was held with exchange students of Bilkent University. In this meeting, we gave details and some information about our project to exchange students. Our resident trivia expert also talked about fairy rings and the mushroom networks behind them, how the Turkish name Cem descended from the Indian god Yama, the Hoan Kiem turtle and the turtle god Kim Qui, Heike Monogatari and various other topics he does not currently remember.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
