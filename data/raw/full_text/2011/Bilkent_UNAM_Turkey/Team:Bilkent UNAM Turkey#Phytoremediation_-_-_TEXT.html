Team:Bilkent UNAM Turkey/Phytoremediation
From 2011.igem.org
Phytoremediation is the conversion of harmful organic substances or heavy metals to less toxic forms by use of plants. Either plant parts (roots, leaves, ash, seed kernels, husk and various inexpensive byproducts of industrial processes are preferred) or live plants can be utilized, dead plants are advantageous because they can be chemically modified to yield better removal capacity.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
