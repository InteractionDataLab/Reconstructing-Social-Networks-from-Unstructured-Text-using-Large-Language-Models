From 2011.igem.org
Synthetic refers to synthesized materials either naturally or artificially designed though it is used widely to describe artificially designed materials. Synthetic biology describes the usage of biological principles and organisms to make engineered structures that can do a certain task or complex tasks that is not usually found in the nature. Known biological systems are redesigned and reconstructured to enable unknown functions of organisms. Mostly unicellular and prokaryotic organisms are used in the process yet incredibly intricate composition of eukaryotic cells causes decrease in achievement rates. Nucleic acids and proteins are predominantly used to make these biological machines since they are considered as the secret codes of life itself. Synthetic biology comprises various disciplines, techniques and approaches to reach its aims. Biology, chemistry, engineering and computer sciences are predominantly used to create a fully functional biological system in an interdisciplinary manner.
