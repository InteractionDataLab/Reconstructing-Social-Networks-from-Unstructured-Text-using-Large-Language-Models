We participated the meeting of the iGEM teams. In our presentation, we described the focus points of our project. In addition, we provided some background about how we develop the idea of this project. We didn’t forget to talk other
Turkish teams about their projects, and of course, to have fun! The Turkey Anatolian agency (AA) made an interview with us.Joy was a part of our presentation; we took lots of photos during the event. https://2011.igem.org/Summer_events/Turkish_Team_Meetup
