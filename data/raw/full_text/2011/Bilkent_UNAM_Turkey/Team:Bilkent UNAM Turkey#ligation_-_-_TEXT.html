Team:Bilkent UNAM Turkey/ligation
From 2011.igem.org
In the molecular biological sense, ligation is the process which one can unite the ends of the nucleic acid sequences in an enzymatic fashion. DNA ligase enzyme which originally repairs the damages occured in the DNA in a cell is used in the ligation process. After the process of restriction and recombination in DNA sequence, ligation of the newly designed sequences is required to put the recombined sequence back into the cells. Ligated sequences preserve DNA integrity and gains stability.  Ligation process is central to all genetic recombination experiments.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
