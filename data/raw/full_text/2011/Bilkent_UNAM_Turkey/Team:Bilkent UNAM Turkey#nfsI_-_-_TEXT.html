A nitroreductase originally characterized in Enterobacter cloacae, though homologs are known in other Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli. As the name might suggest, the enzyme’s role is to reduce nitro (–NO 2) groups, such as those found in TNT, to primary amines. Below is the 3D structure of a typical nitroreductase. Note the flavin mononucleotide cofactors, which most Type I nitroreductases require.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
