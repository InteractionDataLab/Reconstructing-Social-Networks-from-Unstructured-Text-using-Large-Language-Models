Team:Bilkent UNAM Turkey/Enterobacter cloacae
From 2011.igem.org
A gram negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria that lives in guts. A common component of human intestinal fauna (by which I mean that it lives in my guts and your guts too!) and mostly harmless unless you’re immunocompromised, in which case it causes opportunistic infections (which is to say it treats your body like kudzu treats fresh soil, it grows everywhere and you won’t be very pleased with that.)
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
