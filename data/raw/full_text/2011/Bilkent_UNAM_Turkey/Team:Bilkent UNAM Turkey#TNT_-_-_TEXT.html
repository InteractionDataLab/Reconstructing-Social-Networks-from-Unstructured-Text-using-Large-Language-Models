2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene is a yellow, odorless, solid manufactured compound. Its discovery encountered in the late 19th
century. After the serial production has begun, TNT found a wide range of usage areas in industry, military
shells, bombs, and grenades, and in underwater blasting. The commercial production of this compound was banned
because of its toxic effects to the health.
What is the fate of TNT in the environment?
TNT enters to the environment by its storation, usage, and disposal processes. The soil is in the first affected area
that suffers from TNT, is followed by surface water and aquifer. Light exposure is effective to degrade TNT
to its derivative compounds. This process takes place in surface water. All living organisms in the contaminated
sites are affected negatively by TNT and its derivatives.
How might you be exposed to TNT?
If TNT movement occurs in drinking water or your food from chemical waste sites, you might be exposed. You might face
with TNT by eating contaminated foods, drinking contaminated water, or breathing contaminated air. The U.S.
Environmental protection Agency highlighted that above 5 ng/L of TNT in water is toxic. As a result of
incineration (the burning up process of TNT in empty fields), TNT or its derivatives can disperse to the
environment and be taken up by plants or other living organisms. Thus, the residential districts near the
incineration sites are in a great danger. TNT can enter through the skin even if you are exposed to small amounts of it.
What are the effects of TNT in your body?
TNT is considered as to be a highly mutagenic and carcinogenic agent. Contaminated air, water or soil brings TNT
into your body. This chemical enters your body faster when you inhale or digest it than the direct contact (skin).
When TNT enters your body, the bloodstream carries TNT to different parts of your body and your organs.
Liver function disturbance, sperm damage, irritation of the skin, disturbances of the erythrocytes, methemoglobinemia,
or cataract are some of the adverse effects of TNT to your body. Generally, this chemical leaves
your body in 24 hours after exposure.
Are there any regulations for TNT?
The U.S. EPA has announced TNT as a hazardous waste because of its explosive, flammable, toxic, and carcinogenic
characteristics. Transportation of TNT is done only it is in at least 10% water (by weight) and a “flammable solid”
label must be placed on it clearly. 0.5 mg/m3 in air is the threshold of the TNT concentration in a room or
workplace for health safety.
