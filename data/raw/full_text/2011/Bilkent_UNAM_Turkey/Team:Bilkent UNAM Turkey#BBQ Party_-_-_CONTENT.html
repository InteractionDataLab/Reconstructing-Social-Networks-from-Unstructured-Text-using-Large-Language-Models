Material Science and Nanotechnology, under which laboratories we were to
carry out our experiments.</P><P>As all good BBQ parties should, our small picnic began with a presentation
of our project proposal. After taking the comments of our advisors, we
went to the previously designated picnic area to further discuss the
potential problems associated with our ideas... er, I mean we had a lot of
fun.</P><P>Anyhow, we carried out a swift roles allocation (which never happened in
the actual iGEM project, as our team prides itself on being
jacks-of-all-trades.) where a part of the attendees were to start cooking
while the rest had the remarkably easy duty of preparing the table and
then slacking off while pretending to be hard at work. The cooking team
ended up preparing the table too. This often happens. Exhausted from a
hard day of napping peacefully under the sun and discussing future
experiment prospects, the &quot;table preparation team&quot; (which was one only in
name) wolfed down any and all food within their reach while the majority
of the cooking team was still, well, cooking. Serving was their duty too.</P><P>We then played football, volleyball, tug-of-war, dodge-ball and whatever
other sports we could think of and had the required ball for. The cooking
team got their revenge during this period, because they were lean and
hungry and therefore much more athletic than the well-fed, sluggish table
team. We took this to be a valuable experience in how the survival values
of adaptive traits (like the ability to trick conspecifics into preparing
food for oneself) may change depending on the population of conspecifics
and therefore the frequency of intraspecific competition. Also, we predict
that a small number of &quot;table-teamers&quot; should be present for their trick
to remain undetected, as the dynamics are expected to be similar to mimicry.</P><P>In addition, we celebrated the birthday of our advisor Mr. Tekinay’s son!
It was an unforgettable experience for us..</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
