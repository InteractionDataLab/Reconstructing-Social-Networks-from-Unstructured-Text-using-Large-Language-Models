Lazy excuse of a doctoral student who spends all his time reading any research paper except those about the topic
he’s ought to study. Quite knowledgeable about entomology, marine biology and world mythology, can read hieroglyphics.
Still a worthless researcher because he’s supposed to do microbiology work. Special skills
include using his rubber gloves as a sling to shoot.
Eppendorf tubes with remarkable accuracy and reading while walking on difficult terrain (our faculty is
on top of a hill and surrounded by a forest for some reason, there's a lot of difficult terrain here.)

It is Burcu from Bilkent University, Institute of Material Science and Nanotechnology. I am very proud of being a
member of Bilkent UNAM Turkey team because I think; here we reflect the real team spirit. Here is a brief
information about me: I spent every minute of me by listening music! Nothing makes me happy like talking with
people. I do love sports activities if I can bring down my laziness. Reading books is not for me but reading
articles has become my pleasure for a long time. As many members of my team, it is my first IGEM participation.
I hope we will rock the IGEM world with our endless energy and success!

The picture you look represents me. And that is all.
By the way, I like playing computer games such as DotA , TF2 and AoE2 and also -while playing-
I love characterizing other players. In order to do so, I may sometimes change, replace or insert some DNA into computer games,
I mean the source code. Some calls this cheating, but I swear it is not.

I am Tarkan and one of the member of the Bilkent – UNAM – Turkey team. I love watching and playing sports especially
football and basketball just as usual Turkish guys do. I love dancing but generally too shy to start
doing it in public. I like talking and meeting new people. Telling jokes and amusing people is my style of
communication, because that is the best way of telling your good intentions towards others. I participate
volunteering action a lot in the campus which target poor, rural and disabled children. I love them
and enjoy spending time with. So, that is it for me now.

I’m Ufuk, sophomore student of Bilkent University, Molecular Biology and Genetics Department. Playing squash and Dota are my favourite activities, if I win. Fantastic books fascinate me. First book i read was "One Thousand and One Nights". In IGEM; I like its fun and working style. Everything happens together. I like watching movies when it is with friends. This is my first time being in a research project team, so i am really thankful to my team members for sharing their experience and joy.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
