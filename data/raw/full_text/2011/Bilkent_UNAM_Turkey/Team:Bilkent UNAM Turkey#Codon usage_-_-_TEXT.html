Team:Bilkent UNAM Turkey/Codon usage
From 2011.igem.org
Codon usage is the difference of the frequency of usage of each codons in the synonymous codons in the coding DNA of an organism. 20 different aminoacids are represented in the RNA by 64 codons and some group of codons encodes the same aminocid. So, one may not know the actual DNA or RNA sequence from the protein sequence (codon degeneracy). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a bias for synonymous codons and does not generally prefer to use the others. If we design our genetic sequence by using those unfavorable genetic codes, we may end up having less transcribed protein or no transcription. Thus, each gene that will be expressed in a different organism than from the host should be checked for codon usage bias. Codon bias tables are created to serve for this purpose.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
