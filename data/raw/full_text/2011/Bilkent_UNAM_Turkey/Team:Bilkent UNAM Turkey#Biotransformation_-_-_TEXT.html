Team:Bilkent UNAM Turkey/Biotransformation
From 2011.igem.org
Chemical changes imposed on a compound by biological means. Generally, the changes in question are actively facilitated by the organism in question. Synthesis of enzymes, reduction of potentially harmful organic compounds or heavy metals into less toxic forms and even digestion of edible particles can be considered biotransformation. Most work regarding biotransformation focuses on either the detoxification of hazardous materials or the mass production of an useful bacterial byproduct (antibiotics or biodiesel for example.) Or study aims to transform TNT into less toxic (or completely harmless) compounds such as 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) or 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) and therefore falls to the former category. This is accomplished by reducing the nitro groups of TNT into amino groups, hence why the nitro-to-amine converter nfsI is the central piece in our schema.
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
