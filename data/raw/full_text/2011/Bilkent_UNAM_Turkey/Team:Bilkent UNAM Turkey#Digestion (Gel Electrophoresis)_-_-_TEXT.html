Restriction enzyme is a type of enzyme that is able to cut double stranded and single strand DNA from a certain part that composed of specific nucleotide sequences which is literally called as restriction sites. In prokaryotic organisms this enzyme used as a defense mechanism for the host cells as it can degrade foreign organisms (mainly viruses) DNAs. However, as foreign DNA is degrading, host cell protects its own DNA by the addition of methyl group to its DNA with the help of a modification enzyme (methylase). There are more than 2000 restriction enzymes can be found and over 600 are ready for commercial usages like DNA
modification.
Gel electrophoresis, is a way of separation of generally microbiological particles such as DNA ,RNA  and some nanoparticles by running them on a gel. There is an application of electric field which affects the movement of the micro-particles which can be called as electrophoresis. Gel is important for sustaining the medium for the movement of the particles. As gel-electrophoration is a separation way, products of gel electrophoresis can be applied for further experiments such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting
There is a problem with poping up if you see this note.
