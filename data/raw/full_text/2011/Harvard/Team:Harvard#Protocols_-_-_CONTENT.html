</LI></UL><LI>tips:
</LI><LI>keep master mix on ice (because of polymerase)
</LI><LI>if you are making multiple reactions, instead of adding each reagent individually to each tube, make a larger master solution of all the shared reagents in the correct proportions and then divide it among the tubes. Make sure your master solution is in excess of the amount you need (e.g. if you have 6 reactions, make a master solution with 7 or 8 times the volume for each reaction).
</LI><LI>if you are doing a PCR to merely check the presence/absence of a band for a test, or to check the sizes, to conserve KAPA, you can use a total reaction volume of 10ul instead of the usual 25ul, so that one uses 5ul of KAPA per reaction, instead of 12.5ul. One can use 25-30ul when doing a PCR for PCR purification or for gel extraction

Keep an eye on the flash through the glass at all times. It's a good idea to put it in the microwave for 15-20s at a time, take the flask out, swirl it, and then put it back for further heating.

</LI><LI>E gels are much faster than agarose gels (take only 15 min) and simpler to load
</LI><LI>Slide gel into holder. No running buffer is needed.
</LI><LI>Instead of loading buffer, dilute your DNA sample up to 20µL in water. The ladder (5µL is sufficient) should also be diluted in water up to 20µL before loading.
</LI><LI>Keep the orange cover on over the gel. The button at the bottom turns on a UV light so that you can see the DNA bands,and the cover protects your eyes and skin.
</LI><LI>The UV light lets you see the gel bands, but to save a picture use the same imaging procedure as for agarose gels.
</LI><LI>Be warned, however: sometimes the e-gels run inconsistently and messily... if your samples require careful discrimination between band sizes (which requires a clean gel and straight running bands), go with an agarose gel.

</P><PRE>Step  Change
 0.    Wear disposable lab coat or long sleeves to prevent UV-burn. Use a razor blade/scalpel to excise the band.
 2.    Add only 2 gel volumes of buffer QG.
 3.    May need to incubate longer at 50*C (for approximately 15 to 20 minutes)
 4.    Add 10 ul for 3M NaOAc. This will correct the pH and should turn the QG back to yellow. 
 7.    Combine samples of identical DNA in the same column (spin multiple times if necessary).
 9.    Skip this step.
 13.   Elute in 30 ul rather than 50 ul. Use molecular grade H2O instead of Buffer ED to really maximize yield

</P><P><B>Isothermal Assembly</B></P><P>Isothermal Assembly works by combining a cocktail of exonuclease, polymerase, and ligase to fuse dsDNA fragments with sufficiently (20-120 bp) homologous ends. It leaves no &quot;scar&quot; behind, i.e. you can expect your product to contain the EXACT overlap sequence. The reaction may work with shorter ends (e.g. 15 bp), so long as the annealing temperature is higher than 50C.
</P><P>Isothermal assembly reactions are stored in the common -20C freezer as 7.5 ul aliquots (in PCR strip tubes).
</P><P>To perform isothermal assembly:
</P><P>1. PCR up your fragments of choice, and gel purify. High concentration DNA is critical, since it needs to fit in a small volume!
</P><P>2. Not exceeding a total volume of 2.5 ul (can be a bit more, maybe up to 3.5 ul), in a PCR tube, combine fragments at equal molecular ratio [e.g. amount fragment1 = 100 ng * (fragment size 1/ fragment size 2); amount fragment2 = 100 ng * (fragment size 2/ fragment size 1) ... etc.]. If required, bring to 2.5 ul with ddH2O. I recommend using approx. 100 ng of plasmid backbone (fragment containing antibiotic resistance).
</P><P>3. Add the combined fragments (5 ul) <I>[2.5 ul]</I> to 1 Isothermal Assembly reaction aliquot (15 ul) <I>[We use 7.5 ul instead]</I> and mix by pipetting (20 ul total) <I>[10 ul total]</I>.
</P><P>4. Place rxn. at 50C for 15 -60 min <I>[We put it in a thermocycler for 60 min @ 50C, then 4C forever].</I></P><P>5. (optional for chem. transform.) Purify with Qiagen PCR purification (MinElute) kit. Elute in 20 ul of ddH2O.
</P><P>6. Transform with 1 ul of assembly rxn.

The lengths of the annealing regions of the primers are chosen so that they have a similar (within 1°C ) melting temperature for the PCR reaction.
</LI><LI>The PCR reaction is done with the above primers, and a template of a small amount of liquid culture (diluted 30 times) of the omega knockout bacteria hybrid selection strain.
</LI><LI>The product is run on a gel, and then either gel extracted (if there are side products) or PCR purified (if the reaction ran clear) and eluted in molecular grade water, not EB, since the ions and salts would otherwise cause electrical arcing during electroporation
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Lambda_Red_Recombination">Lambda Red Recombination</SPAN></H3><OL><LI> Activate lambda red through temperature sensitive activation. For the ECNR2 strain, this involved taking the culture that’s grown in LB, at 30°C at around midlog, and placing it in a water bath at 42°C for 15 min to activate the lambda red machinery. This is because it has a temperature inducible promoter.
</LI><LI> Add 1-1.5 mL of mid-log cells in culture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Spin in the centrifuge for 1 minute at 15000rpm (max speed)
</LI><LI> (All steps need to be done on ice and the pipette tips, the cuvettes, and the molecular grade water must be kept cold at all times.)
</LI><LI> Decant the liquid at the top, and use a pipette to remove as much of the liquid as possible without disturbing the bacterial pellet. Change tips. Wash cells with 1 mL of cold water, pipette up and down to mix them well, and spin in centrifuge for 1 minute at max speed.
</LI><LI> Repeat the wash step.
</LI><LI> Tip: When you are removing the liquid after spinning down, it helps to hold the tube so that the bacterial pellet is at the top and then use the pipette to draw out the liquid right below it. This is done so that the salts from the culture media can be thoroughly washed away, as they could interfere with the use of the electroporator from Step 10 (and onwards).
</LI><LI> Resuspend cells with 50 μL of cold water.
</LI><LI> Add 50-200 ng of insertion construct to the microcentrifuge tube with the bacterial pellet. This could also could be accomplished by taking a separate microcentrifuge tube, and adding enough of the insertion construct to almost 50 μL of cold water in an earlier step, so that these steps can be accomplished more quickly. Since the PCR product(insertion construct) from part A was at a concentration of about 70ng/μL to about 200ng/μL for the different times we used this method, we usually added 1-2μL of the construct to about 48-49μL of water in a microcentrifuge tube and placed it on ice before we began part B from step 2. It helps to reduce the amount of time the bacteria are suspended in water since it can lyse the cells because the surrounding solution is hypotonic to the bacterial cytoplasm.
</LI><LI> Add the 50 μL solution to the cells, pipette up and down to mix them well, and then place in a chilled cuvette.
</LI><LI> Set the electroporation machine to Eco1, 1.8 volts. A time constant of 4.8ms is a good number. You can also run a 'blank' to figure out the optimum time constant. A blank is run by filling a cuvette with 50 μL of water, which is put in the electroporator and pulsed, and its time constant is taken as as the standard. We want a time constant as close to that for water as possible, because pure water has no salts.
</LI><LI> Before placing the cuvette in the electroporator, make sure that all water is wiped off of cuvette, so that it is dry, or it can interfere with electrical contact.
</LI><LI> After electroporation immediately place 1 mL of LB in cuvette, pipette up and down to mix the cells in the LB and resuspend them.
</LI><LI> Then place that 1mL of bacteria in LB into  2 mL of LB in a culture tube and allow them to grow for 2 to 3 hours in correct temperature (30°C for ECNR2).
</LI><LI> After three hours, plate out culture in different concentrations of bacteria on agar plates with the relevant antiobiotic, since the construct has the corresponding antibiotic resistance gene, and this allows us to select for the bacteria that have the construct inserted into the genome.
</LI><LI> Grow up the cultures  on the plates overnight, and use a colony to do PCR or sequencing to check for the insert via its sequence, or the band size on the gel.
