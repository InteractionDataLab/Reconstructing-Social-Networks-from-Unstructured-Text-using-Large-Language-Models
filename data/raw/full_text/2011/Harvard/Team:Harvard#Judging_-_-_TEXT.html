Wiki Highlights
Read our project description and summary on our Project page: more details on how team members completed work for the three sections of our project are on Design , Synthesize , and Test pages, respectively.
Results of all parts of our project (including our biobricks ) are located on our Results page, along with an Attributions and Acknowledgments section.
Human practices can be found on our Human Practices page.
Please be sure to stop by our poster during the poster session with any questions.
Accomplishments
Experimental Results
✓ Researched zinc finger proteins and choose 6 novel,
clinically relevant target sequences
✓ Generated
55,000
zinc finger protein sequences using
bioinformatics
✓ Used three recently developed technologies together for the first time: a
foundational advance
✓ Expressed those 55,000 sequences
in E.coli
, with a sub-library for each target
✓ Created a
genomic one-hybrid selection system
sensitive enough to detect
one hit in a million
✓ Found at least
15 novel zinc finger proteins
Biobricks and Protocols
✓ Submitted
5 Biobricks
to the registry, including our one-hybrid selection strain
✓ Created several
chassis
for our Biobricks, including our one-hybrid selection strain
✓ Used and shared our
easy-to-follow protocols
✓ Made protocols , Biobricks , and source code
freely available
, so that others can adapt them for other projects
Human Practices
✓ Interviewed
zinc finger researchers
Dr. Keith Joung and Dr. George Church
✓ Interviewed chip-based DNA synthesis researcher Dr. Sriram Kosuri
✓ Researched
intellectual property
and how it applies to zinc finger proteins
✓ Created a
timeline and case study
of zinc finger intellectual property
✓ Reached out to our elected representatives about the potential effects of IP on zinc finger research and synthetic biology generally
✓ Handed out
IP pamphlets and chassis data sheets
at our poster presentation
✓
Educated
local high school students about synthetic biology to provide accurate information from sources other than the media.
Foundational Advance
Combining Computational Design, High-throughput Synthesis, and Selection
We
brought together 3 new technologies
to create a working pipeline that allows scientists to
engineer novel protein-DNA interactions
. Our methods represents a
fundamentally different way of building new biological parts and devices
: using selection to identify working members of a large computationally predicted library of potential designs.
Putting parts and devices directly onto the genome
The genome is the next frontier in synthetic biology
. Our project has made use of genome modification in order to design a new device that allows the testing of DNA-protein interactions. We want iGEM and the broader synthetic biology community to use these techniques as an alternative to plasmids. To encourage their adoption,
we have submitted new E. coli chassis that allow easy genome modification
, and
we have provided detailed protocols
for their use.
