</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Team_TolC_6">Team TolC</SPAN></H3><UL><LI>PCR done of 4 colonies picked from KAN plate (with ECNR2 after recombineering with the KAN-ZFB-wp construct. Running an E-gel showed that the insert was not present. Since the KAN plates were old, it might be speculated that the plates were old, and so, the colonies were not selected for KAN resistance.
</LI><LI>Primers were TolC_seq_F and TolC_seq_R.
</LI><LI>Without insertion these two primers will create 449 bp sequence, and with insertion length will be 1650 bp

To check, one of the old KAN plates was plated the same way and put in at 2:30pm. (These plates will be checked tomorrow morning.)
</LI></UL><LI>PCR done of a few of the rpoZ MAGE with stop codon insertions. Oligo name: rpoZ_MAGE_KO (Noah's oligo) (Noah's plates, after two cycles of MAGE, on both ECNR2 and ECNR2ÎTolC). The side product in the gel could be due to a low annealing temperature of 53Â°C, so we should do a gradient PCR (e.g.55-66Â°C) to get the most product the next time. </LI></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
