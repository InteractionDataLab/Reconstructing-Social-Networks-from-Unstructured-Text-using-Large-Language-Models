Team members decided to focus on zinc finger proteins because of the technologies (chip DNA synthesis and MAGE) available to us: we believed that developing new zinc finger proteins was a way to use both technologies to their greatest possible extent. <B>This project was not an extension or a continuation of any existing work on zinc fingers, in the Church lab or otherwise.</B> The original idea of zinc finger proteins was contributed by the Harvard iGEM 2011 advisors and mentors, including but not limited to, Jagesh Shah, Srivatsan Raman, Daniel Goodman, Noah Taylor, Jameson Rogers, Joyce Yang, and Jun Li.  
</P><P>This project was made possible by support from Dr. George Church's lab at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering as well as Alain Viel at the Harvard Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.  Without their valuable guidance and great patience, we never would have been able to achieve what have done so far. While our teaching fellows - members of the Church Lab - gave us many opportunities, they also made sure that we achieved our goals and results entirely via our own work: our teaching fellows provided inspiration, team members achieved what we did through our own perspiration. 
</P><P>Although the project is the first to combine several key technologies in novel ways, these technologies were developed outside of Harvard iGEM.  The multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) method was developed by Harris Wang et al<A href="#References">[2]</A>.  Chip-based DNA synthesis method was developed by Sri Kosuri et al<A href="#References">[1]</A>, and the actual oligo synthesis was generously provided by Agilent Technologies, a sponsor of iGEM. Lambda red was originally developed by Yu et al<A href="#References">[3]</A>. We would like to make it clear that we do not claim any credit whatsoever for the creation of the technologies used in this project. <I>Our project and Foundational Advance proposal rest on our successful use of and novel integration of these multiple technologies in concert, and subsequent application of this system to generate novel zinc finger proteins as a proof of concept.</I></P><P>We owe great thanks to Alain Viel for his flawless management of the logistics of iGEM, including but not limited to providing lab space, ordering lab supplies when we needed them, arranging our trip to the Americas Regional and World Jamborees, and for his excellent taste in footwear. Furthermore, we would also like to thank our lab manager Andrew Cumming for all of his practical lab advice and for helping to make everything run smoothly in the day to day logistics of lab. 
</P><P>Jagesh Shah provided us with excellent advice on both our project and the iGEM competition as a whole: what to expect, how to improve our presentation, and not to take ourselves too seriously. We also owe Jagesh's children Harvard iGEM t-shirts for depriving them of Jagesh's company when several of our meetings ran late into the night.
