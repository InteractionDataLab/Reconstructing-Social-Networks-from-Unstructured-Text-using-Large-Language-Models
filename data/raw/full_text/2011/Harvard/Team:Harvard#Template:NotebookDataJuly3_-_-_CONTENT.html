Miniprep product from colonies 78, 79, and 82 had the expected band at 1.4 kb, while 80 and 81 had a band that was slightly smaller than the the expected product size. We saw a similar band in our <A href="#PCR_of_product_from_isothermal_assembly_of_expression_plasmid">PCR of the isothermal assembly reaction product</A>. We are unsure exactly what is causing this band. If either the omega subunit or ultramers were missing from the plasmid, a similar sized product would result since both are ~350 bp. We are curious if a plasmid can still be formed if one of these components were missing. 
</P><P>We checked the concentrations of our miniprep product to see if that would explain our problem.

</PRE><P>We can't tell whether the concentration of the miniprep product contributed to the strange band we saw. 81 had the highest concentration but still didn't work. We decided to try plating 4 more colonies from 80 and 81, to see if any of them have the appropriate band. 
</P><P>We also decided to make final plates of cultures 78, 79, and 82, using 2 ul of culture and 50 ul of LB+spec. They were plated on new spec plates. We will incubate them at 37* overnight.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Checking_the_expression_plasmid_plates">Checking the expression plasmid plates</SPAN></H4><P>All the plates had colonies on them, although there were still areas of unspecific growth, presumably because of uneven dilution of the spec into the LB plates.

Strangely, we did not get results for sample 78 (FH bottom), even though we got a band there in a PCR earlier today that used the junction primers.  We got positive results for samples 79 and 82, and everything else seems to check out with these two samples (bands present in the correct size with junction primers from both isothermal assembly and miniprep templates).  However, we are still having problems with samples 80 and 81, which may be a problem with the colonies that we picked.  For now, we will assume that the isothermal assembly worked, due to colonies growing on the spec plates for samples 80 and 81, and that we had simply picked bad colonies.  We will find out tomorrow if other colonies from the same plate give us the same results.</DIV><DIV id="716" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_16th">July 16th</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Team_ZF_2">Team ZF</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Colony_minipreps">Colony minipreps</SPAN></H4><P>Minipreps were performed on all of the samples except for a few where nothing grew in the LB/spec media.

Possible reasons for no growth for these samples may include: (1) The colony was somehow not a transformed colony and was a cheater (possibly picked from a spot where there was a smaller amount of spec in the unevenly distributed dish), and (2) the colony did not get picked up properly with the pipet tip.

</PRE><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Making_more_cultures_and_plates_of_our_expression_plasmids">Making more cultures and plates of our expression plasmids</SPAN></H4><P>We picked two more colonies from plate 85 today and made 5 ml cultures from them. We also made 2 fresh cultures from the old 85 cultures, by taking 50 ul of old culture and 5 ml LB+spec. We will leave them overnight in the 37* shaker and perform minipreps and PCRs on them tomorrow. 
</P><P>We made positive control cultures from 81.1, 81.4, 80.1, and 80.2, in order to test our minipreps tomorrow. They reactions have a wide range of concentrations post-miniprep, and we are curious to see if the same will happen after performing a miniprep a second time.
</P><P>Another way to figure out if our expression plasmids contain the appropriate insert is by using a restriction enzyme to cut it and then performing a PCR on the linear DNA. We had previously inserted 2 cutsites on our plasmids, Bsa1 (for insertion of finger 1) and Xba1. The lab already has Xba1, and we ordered Bsa1. Xba1 can be affected by methylation if it is preceded by 'GA' or followed by 'TC' <A href="http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/faqproductR0145.asp#874" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A>; we checked and our sequences should not be affected.
</P><P>
We also re-plated 78, 79, and 82 today, one set of plates with 1 ul of culture, and the other set with 10 ul.

(The kan cassette is under a strong promoter and does not have a transcriptional terminator, so it's possible that RNA polymerase might keep transcribing through the end of kan and into his3.)

</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Minipreps_of_colonies_and_controls">Minipreps of colonies and controls</SPAN></H4><P>Our minipreps from Saturday had low yields, especially for culture 85. We suspect this is why the PCR [[#Gel analysis of miniprep junction PCR on Sunday did not work for this sample. Unfortunately, 85.3 and 85.4 did not grow even after being left in the shaker overnight. These were two cultures we made by picking new colonies from plate 85. This may have occurred because we did not actually pick the colony, or the colony was a cheater. Thus, we performed minipreps on 80.1, 80.2, 81.1, 81.4 (the controls, chosen for their wide range of concentrations after our first miniprep), and 85.1 and 85.2. 
</P><P>In order to figure our why our minipreps were resulting in unexpectedly low yields and increase our yields:
</P><UL><LI>We tested the pH of our water and Buffer EB. 
</LI><LI>The pH of our aliquot of water was ~4-5 (too acidic...we are unsure why)
</LI><LI>The pH of our Buffer EB was ~7. 
</LI><LI>Ideally, the DNA should be eluted by a solution of pH 7, so we decided to use Buffer EB during the elution step.
</LI></UL><LI>We also checked the copy number of the origin of replication used in our plasmids. ColE1 apparently has a low copy number, which might also explain our low yields.
</LI><LI>We had made 5 ml of culture in an attempt to increase our yields. 
</LI><P>Our yields were larger than our first round of minipreps, although the purities were rather low. We decided to proceed anyway.

This is in preparation for making a new plate of sample 85 (the old plate was not a good spec plate and had lots of unspecific growth as well as very few colonies, so if we used this plate for more colony picking our choices would be very limited).  This new plate should also give us more luck with picking colonies and having them actually grow in the LB+spec.
