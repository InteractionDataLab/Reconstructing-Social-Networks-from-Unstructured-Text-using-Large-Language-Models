However, we got an extremely low yield of 3.4 ng/ul.
</P><P>After talking with Dan about the not-so-ideal experiences with Bsa-HF, we decided to make a few changes to our protocols, and that we would try the following to see how they would work:
</P><P><I>To troubleshoot the poor oligo cutting:</I>
1.5 ul of enzyme (20 units/ul)
2 ul of NEB buffer 4
0.5 ul of BsaI-HF
16 ul of DNA</P><P>20 ul total
</P><P>Incubute for 1.5 hour in a thermal cycler at 37 degrees.
Denature at 65 degrees for 20 minutes and then pcr purify.
</P><P><I>For troubleshooting the poor plasmid cutting:</I>
Do the same thing but do it for longer (2 hours) and also run an uncut plasmid to see which bands come up.
</P><P>We checked to see if dcm methylation happens for bsaI at our cut sites, but there were no signs of the dcm recognition sequences (CCAGG or CCTGG) anywhere near them.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="GFP_reporter_plasmid_sequencing">GFP reporter plasmid sequencing</SPAN></H4><P>Today we miniprepped the four GFP colonies that we picked yesterday in order to run a junction PCR on them and send them out for sequencing.  Our junction PCR used the previous protocol's annealing temperature of 55 degrees, but the extension time was lengthened to 1:15 to account for the extra length of the GFP insert (some additional 700-800 bp).  After the PCR, the samples were sent out for sequencing with both the forward junction primer and the reverse 100 bp primer (ZF116 by the primer index).

We also made final plates of these bacteria, using 1/1000 ul on spec plates.</DIV><DIV id="806" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August_6th">August 6th</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Team_ZF_2">Team ZF</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="New_miniprep_protocol">New miniprep protocol</SPAN></H4><P>Today, we tried a new miniprep protocol in which the DNA is precipitated out of solution with EtOH, and no spin columns are used.  This is because we suspect that our low yields may be due in some part to DNA being washed out of the column prematurely, or DNA not being washed completely out of the column during the elution step.  In getting rid of the column, there is no step during which we may lose DNA.
</P><P>We are extremely happy to report that after weeks of getting dismal miniprep yields, we have found a new protocol that gives us insanely high yields (compared to before)!!!  The protocol is the following:
</P><OL><LI>Centrifuge 1.5 ml of saturated cells at maximum speed for 1 minute, discard supernatant.
</LI><LI>Resuspend cells in 200 ul of Buffer P1.
</LI><LI>Add 200 ul of Buffer P2 to lyse the cells.  Mix by inverting several times, and let sit for 3 minutes.
</LI><LI>Add 200 ul of Buffer N3 to precipitate SDS, mix by inverting several times.
</LI><LI>Centrifuge at 4 degrees for 15 minutes.
</LI><LI>Transfer supernatant to new tube, add 1 ml of 100% EtOH to precipitate DNA.
</LI><LI>Centrifuge for 5 minutes at RT.  At this point a DNA pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube.
</LI><LI>Discard EtOH, wash DNA pellet with 1.5 ml of 70% EtOH (this gets rid of salts).
</LI><LI>Centrifuge for 5 minutes at RT.
</LI><LI>Discard EtOH, let tubes dry for approximately 6-8 minutes by inverting them on a piece of Kimwipe tissue.
</LI><LI>Resuspend DNA pellet in 20 ul of heated EB buffer.
</LI></OL><P>Our resulting yield was overall <B>463.4 ng/ul</B>!!  The purity also looked extremely good, with a 260/280 value of 1.98.  The nanodrop results can be viewed below:

This seemed very high considering our previous results, and we are suspicious that there may be some genomic DNA contamination.  Contamination may occur either from leaving cultures on the shaker for too long (with cells lysing and releasing their genomic DNA) or from shaking too hard during the lysis process (shearing chromosomal DNA and allowing it to escape the cell).  The lysis process was performed by mixing through tube inversion, so this is likely not the cause.  The tubes that were miniprepped yesterday were left on the shaker for approximately 22 hours, while the tubes from today were on the shaker for 17 hours.  Strangely, although the tubes were on the shaker for a shorter amount of time, there was still higher yield.
</P><P>The concentration and absorbance curve data can be seen below:

</P><P>The uncut plasmid was also run out on a gel alongside the cut oligos (loaded 0.5 ul).  This should theoretically have been around 500 ng of DNA, but for some reason it only shows up very faintly.  This is not good news.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Results_for_new_restriction_enzyme_protocol">Results for new restriction enzyme protocol</SPAN></H4><P>The resulting reaction from the oligo cut with Bsa-HF yesterday was run out on a gel with the following results:
</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">blah</DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>There appears to be a band of the correct size.  However, there is still incomplete cutting as indicated by the second band at around 100 bp, but there is no longer a band at the uncut position, indicating that all of the oligos underwent a single or double cut.
</P><P>The plasmid DNA from the miniprep today was also put through a restriction digest using the same 2 hour protocol as the oligo digest.  The result was then PCR purified, but the yield was extremely low compared to the input.  Using 16 ul of DNA, there were 16 ug of plasmid that went into the restriction digest.  After PCR purification and elution in 30 ul of EB, the yield was only 28.5 ng/ul, meaning only 0.855 ug of DNA in the purified product.  This translate to over <B>95%</B> of the DNA somehow being lost in the PCR purification.  We are at a complete loss as to why this has happened...
</P><P>The cut plasmid DNA was run alongside uncut plasmid in a gel, with the results below:
</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:124px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">blah</DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
Although the bands are faint, the cut band is somewhere around the correct size (around 2.8 kb).  Although the band appears to be anywhere between 3 kb and 4 kb in the gel, the ladder ran strangely for some reason.  However, there is still a fairly well-defined band instead of a smear in the cut lane.  This in itself is a huge relief - if there were significant genomic DNA contamination, we might expect to get a smear from many differently sized cuts.  Furthermore, the uncut band looks standard for a plasmid, similar to the picture on the website here: [<A href="http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/donald.slish/Electrophoresis.html" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A>].  There are three bands in our gel as they appear on the website.  However, our linearized plasmid is actually fairly close to the bottom band for the uncut plasmid, which is presumably the supercoiled form.</DIV><DIV id="808" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August_8th">August 8th</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Team_Wolfe_3">Team Wolfe</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="MAGE_sequencing">MAGE sequencing</SPAN></H4><UL><LI>Colonies

Colonies designated 1-4 are 5 ul of the ones we sent out for sequencing. Those designated 5-8 were 2 ul colonies which were picked from our reporter plate then and diluted in 10 ul LB+spec. The plate had the following configuration:

</LI></UL><P>After shining blue light on the plate, nothing glowed. We realized that this was because we did not have a spacer between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon, meaning the ribosome would not be able to reach both sites. After doing some reading, we realized that a spacer of 6-10 bps is ideal. We will design this tomorrow.

According to what we discovered online, it seems that the spacing between the ribosome binding site and the ATG start codon is very important for transcription efficiency.  We had previously thought that there were 8 bp from the <I>beginning</I> of the RBS to the ATG codon, but instead it is really 5-9 bp in between the <I>end</I> of the RBS and the ATG codon that is correct.  We thus added the spacer that comes directly from the Ambion website, which is AGGAGG<B>TATATAC</B>ATG (spacer bolded).
