negative control library colonies</SPAN></H4><P>Today I miniprepped the 24 colonies that were picked and grown to saturation last night.  These 24 colonies should contain a good number of the 18 practice plate plasmids within them.  The minipreps were very successful for these strains, yielding concentrations from ~30-60 ng/ul.  Nida ran a junction PCR on the 24 miniprepped products, and we sent them out for sequencing in order to determine which of the 18 practice plate oligos are contained within these 24 colonies.  The yields of the minipreps can be seen below:
</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Miniprep concentrations and purities</DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Selection_plasmid_concentrations">Selection plasmid concentrations</SPAN></H4><P>In order to proceed with the experiment #2 outlined yesterday, Nida and I combined the miniprepped products (everything except for sample 6, which had very low miniprep yields for some reason) in equal molar ratios according to their concentrations.  This constitutes our negative control library, containing complete zinc fingers targeted towards the CB bottom target, but not towards the Zif268 binding site.
</P><P>I then took the negative control library and spiked it with varying amounts of Zif268 whole plasmid, yielding mixes that contained in total 500 ng of plasmid.  Thus, for the positive and negative plasmid controls, they each contained 500 ng of Zif268 and 500 ng of negative control library, respectively.  For the 1:10 dilution, there were 50 ng of Zif268 and 450 ng of negative control, and so on.  The Zif268 plasmid that was used originated from the midiprep that Nida performed last Friday.
</P><P>The 8 mixtures outlined yesterday were then transformed into the EcNR2 selection strain, and plated on spec plates.  This will simply select for bacteria that contain plasmid, but not specifically for those that contain Zif268 plasmid.
</P><P>To see the volumes used for creating the plasmid dilutions, see the following file: <A href="/File:HARVPractice_Library_Assembly.xlsx" title="File:HARVPractice Library Assembly.xlsx">Practice Library Assembly</A></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Chip_library_assembly">Chip library assembly</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="PCR_of_Chip_Oligos">PCR of Chip Oligos</SPAN></H4><P>With Sri and Danâs guidance, I performed a qPCR on the chip oligo's using the protocol outlined in the supplementary section of Sri's paper. I performed six reactions using the appropriate primer in each case (CB top, CB bottom, FH top, FH bottom, Myc 981, Myc 198). I used the following recipe for the PCR (total volume 200 ul): 
</P><UL><LI>100 ul Sybr Green master mix
</LI><LI>200 nm primer (4 ul each of 10 um primer) 
</LI><LI>2 ul chip
</LI><LI>90 ul water 
</LI></UL><P>I ran the reactions on the thermocycler, while standing by to see the graphs being produced, using the following program:
</P><UL><LI>95* for 1 minute
</LI><LI>Initially, the reactions occur at an exponential rate. During this period: 
</LI><LI>95* for 10 seconds
</LI><LI>62* for 30 seconds
</LI></UL><LI>Once the reaction began to plateau, I stopped the reaction. Prior to this point all the oligos were being amplified equally. Once the plateau occurs, amplication occurs at varying rates. This took about 12 cycles total. 
</LI><P>FH Top samples had slightly less volume, and plateaued earlier. This may have occurred due to too little water or master mix being added. 
</P><P>I performed a PCR purification on the PCR product at got the following yields:

When comparing the intensity of the bands to the ladder, it does indeed look like there is approximately 20 ng/ul DNA in the products.</DIV><DIV id="818" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August_18th">August 18th</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Justin_2">Justin</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Transformation_results">Transformation results</SPAN></H4><P>The plates of transformed bacteria yesterday were uneven in their efficiencies because some of the plates had a low time constant for the electroporation (around 4.8) when a good time constant was around 5.8.  We got excellent efficiency in the transformation for Zif268 alone, but for the plasmid mixes that included the negative control library, we got poor time constants.  We still got colonies, but instead of getting a lawn of bacteria there were approximately 150 discrete colonies on the plate.
</P><P>To get around this, Noah picked colonies from the plates and inoculated fresh LB/spec with them, and let them grow to saturation over the course of the day.  We used these resulting saturated cultures in our selection plates later in the day.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Pre-transformation_library_selection_plates">Pre-transformation library selection plates</SPAN></H4><P>Today, Noah and I prepared selection plates to test our ability to distinguish a positive hit among negative controls in varying proportions.  The pre-transformation aspect refers to the fact that it is the Zif268 plasmid that is diluted into the negative control plasmids before transformation, rather than diluting Zif268 bacteria into the negative control bacteria after transformation (this is analogous to how it will be done with the chip).  Using the negative control library assembled from yesterday, we created a 96-well plate with the following dimensions.

</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Selection_plate_seeding_protocol">Selection plate seeding protocol</SPAN></H4><P>Notes: Each well contained 150 ul of liquid, and a 1/100 dilution of bacteria at an OD of 3 (so this would be adding 1.5 ul of bacteria).  The bacteria were grown up in LB to saturation and were washed in NM twice.  This was accomplished by the following steps:
</P><OL><LI>Take the equivalent of 800 ul of 1.5 OD bacteria into a tube.
</LI><LI>Centrifuge the bacteria into a pellet (max speed for 1 min)
</LI><LI>Pipette off as much LB as possible, using a 1000 ul pipet first and then switching to a 200 ul pipet.
</LI><LI>Resuspend the bacteria pellet in 500 ul of NM (1st wash).
</LI><LI>Recentrifuge into pellet.
</LI><LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 (2nd wash). 
</LI><LI>Resuspend in 400 ul of NM (this gets it to an OD of 3).
</LI><LI>The bacteria sample is now ready to be used.
</LI></OL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="GFP_reporter_plasmid_miniprep">GFP reporter plasmid miniprep</SPAN></H4><P>Today, Nida and I miniprepped 6 ml of GFP reporter cells, consolidating the equivalent of 2 minipreps into one column.  However, the yields and purities were pretty terrible, with yields of 7 and 11 ng/ul and purities that were much greater than 2.  This is likely to be caused by the fact that the cultures that we miniprepped were prepared by spiking 3 ml of LB/spec with 1 ml of saturated culture in an attempt to grow up a lot of culture in a short period of time.  There was likely a lot of cell lysis and general cell debris that hindered the miniprep, causing it to give such terrible yields.
</P><P>We inoculated 12 more ml of culture for miniprepping tomorrow morning, since we are low on time.  This should hopefully give us enough culture to work with such that the miniprep will eventually give us the quantity/concentration of DNA required for transformation and/or plasmid library testing.

</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Planning_for_ligation_of_library_and_backbone">Planning for ligation of library and backbone</SPAN></H4><P>We were unable to perform the ligation today. If we want to use 200 ng per ligation reaction we need 1000 ng of DNA, which is the amount we started with. We can cut some more backbone, or phosphatase the backbone I had cut earlier (conc: 69 ng/ul). We can also use 100 ng of backbone instead.
</P><P>Based on the yields of the PCR clean up, as assuming 100 ng of backbone, we'll need the following amounts of insert for our ligations:
</P><PRE>Insert:backbone   Amount of insert (ul)
 2:1               1
 3:1               1.5
 5:1               2.5
 8:1               4
</PRE><P>This is because our insert is 137 bp and our backbone is 2788 bp. For equal molar ratios, we'll need 4.9 ng (or 0.5 ul) of insert for a 1:1 insert:backbone.

</LI></UL><LI>pSB1C3 shipping plasmid: 1st PCR cleanup failed, so we redigested using the <A href="http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/protocol445.asp" class="external text" rel="nofollow">New England Biolab's Biobrick kit instructions</A>. Minelute produced a yield of 30 ng/uL, so a lot of DNA was lost but the concentration was still workable.
</LI><LI>Zinc finger + omega subunit: Mineulte produced 77.8ng/uL
