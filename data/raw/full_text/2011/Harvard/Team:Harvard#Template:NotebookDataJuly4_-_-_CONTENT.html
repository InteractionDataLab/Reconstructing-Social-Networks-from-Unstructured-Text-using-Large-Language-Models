They both yielded colonies, but the 10 ul plates only had a handful while the 50 ul plates had around 15-20 colonies each.  We picked four colonies from each plate and grew them in LB/spec so that tomorrow we can perform a miniprep and send them off for sequencing.  We should know the final verdict by Wednesday regarding which ones are good or bad.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Glycerol_stockmaking">Glycerol stockmaking</SPAN></H4><P>We got the sequencing results back from last Friday, and took the following colonies to make into glycerol stock solutions: 77.1, 79.2, 80.1, 81.1 (x2 for both FH bottom and Myc 198), 82.1, 83.4, 84.1, Zif268.  These colonies are a subset of the &quot;good&quot; colonies from our sequencing results from Sunday.  We mixed 120 ul of bacteria in mid-log with 300 ul of 80% glycerol to make the final solution, which was stored at -80 degrees C.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Restriction_enzyme_test">Restriction enzyme test</SPAN></H4><P>We tested both XbaI and BsaI on the junction PCR product using colony 79.4 as a template (which was used because it was a &quot;bad&quot; sequence overall but had intact BsaI and XbaI cut sites).  The junction PCR product is 1326 bp, and we expected to see bands of 593 and 739 bp with XbaI, and 717 and 578 bp with BsaI.  Our restriction digest recipe consisted of the following per reaction:
</P><UL><LI>1 ul 10X buffer (NE biolabs buffer 4)
</LI><LI>7.9 ul H2O
</LI><LI>1 ul DNA (~100 ng)
</LI><LI>1 ul enzyme (~2 units)
</LI><LI>1 ul BSA (100x)
</LI></UL><P>The two gels we ran for this digest showed that XbaI did NOT work, which may be due to XbaI being too old.  However, we did get double bands both times for BsaI.  Our egel was strange because of uneven loading, and so we were unable to determine the true size of both bands, but the agarose gel we ran later showed the two bands in the right positions.  The two gels can be seen below:

For the Zif268 reaction, an annealing temperature of 65*C was used, and for the rest, the annealing temperature was 58*C.  For all reactions, the extension time was 15 seconds.

Extension time was 30 seconds.  This looked great.  The pictures for the two reactions can be seen below:

We will only add the GFP to Zif 268 (whole) because if we can show through GFP that the selection system works for Zif 268, we can assume it also works for the other zinc fingers.

</P><UL><LI>Testing the selection system by preparing our expression plasmids in parallel (i.e. creating 18 plasmids in separate reactions), and then combining them all at the end and transforming them into the selection strains.

</LI><LI>Testing the cutting/ligation by combining all of the oligos first, and then carrying out the construction of the different expression plasmids all in the same tube.
</LI></UL><P>Note that the results for both will ultimately yield DNA libraries if they work (except that the first experiment is much more foolproof in terms of actually yielding a library than the second experiment).
</P><P>To carry out the first experiment, the following steps need to be undertaken:
</P><OL><LI>Perform PCRs on each of the practice plate oligos such that we end up with a relatively high concentration of DNA after PCR and PCR purification (over 40 ng/ul).
</LI><LI>Cut both plasmid backbone and oligos with BsaI type II restriction enzyme.
</LI><LI>PCR purify restriction products to get rid of enzyme and junk DNA.
</LI><LI>Run phosphatase reaction to prevent autoligation.
</LI><LI>Mix and ligate to get full plasmid.
</LI><LI>Some tips:
</LI><LI>Each ligation reaction should only have 10-15 ul volume.
</LI><LI>You should have 100 ng of backbone per reaction
</LI><LI>Since we are planning 18 reactions, we will need 1800 ng of backbone, which is several minipreps worth
</LI><LI>The backbone:oligo ratio should be appoximately 1:4
</LI><LI>In our case, the backbone is 2.2 kb and the insert is 131 bp, so for 100 ng of backbone there should be ~20 ng of insert
</LI><LI>Gel extract plasmid to get final library.

Of note, after lysis (during addition of buffer P2), the tubes turned extremely blue, darker blue than we had ever seen before.

Today, we ran a gel to see if the results were any different, but alas, they were the same.  It seems that the primers for CB bottom also amplify out the control sequences, which means that our primer tags are not as specific as we thought they were.  The gel can be seen below, with the lanes arranged as follows: CB primer + CB DNA, control primer + CB DNA, control primer + control DNA, and control primer + CB DNA.  We would ideally expect bands in lanes 1 and 3 and no bands in lanes 2 and 4.  However, this was not the case:

It may also be worth ordering oligos to represent the other 5 subpools of targets and cross test the primers with each DNA subpool to make sure that the primers are specific enough to pull out only one subpool.  In the end though, this specificity is not critical to our success, and so it is ok if it doesn't eventually work.

Today we seeded 4 tubes of culture with 100 ul of CB bottom bacteria at saturation.  Each tube carried 4 ml of culture.  The tubes were put on the shaker at approximately 6:30 pm, so they will be ready for miniprep tomorrow morning after the lab meeting.</DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
