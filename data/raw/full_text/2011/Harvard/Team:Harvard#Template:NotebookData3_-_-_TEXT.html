Wet Lab
His3 sequencing results:
The sequencing results showed that the His3 (HisB) gene is still present in the strain and without any early stop codons. There is a 2 aa deletion in the middle of the protein, but its purpose is unknown and the gene likely is still fully functional.
Restreak selection strain on plate from glycerol stock--tomorrow we will PCR the His3 locus and sequence again just to be sure.
Made oligos for MAGE to insert stop codons and make a frame shift in the endogenous His3 gene, so that if necessary we can knockout His3 ourselves.
Selection strain with lambda red:
Reinoculated and made glycerol stock
prepared for MAGE tomorrow

FQCRICMRNFSzif268 F2 Backbone/Helix F1/TGEKPlinker
The Persikov data shows weak predictive power for OPEN amino acid sequences. Our conclusion is that Persikov's program is not well-suited for incorporation into our helix generator. Testing Persikov's helices in his program yeilded mostly accurate results (approximately 24/25 matched known binding information). This is an important test because it proved that we are using the program correctly and that the program is in fact working properly. However, testing the OPEN sequences in Persikov's program resulted in numerous false negative values which informed our decision not to use Persikov's program to check our own hellix-generating program.
Phone Call with Dan
How conservative/risky should we be in terms of using other backbones?
Conservative
Possible Pros:
More likely to get something that will work
Depending on how "smart" our probabilities are (from our ZF generation algorithm), we could cover a lot of novel space without straying too far from zif268
Worst Case:Something we can show for iGEM (we covered the same ground OPEN did, and found many of the same ZFs, but with a targeted approach, a "smarter" method-- not throwing random things at it; Chip is not ours, but the program is "smarter")
Possible Cons:
Might end up covering the same ground as OPEN, but doing a "worse" job than they did
Less likely to discover new/groundbreaking things (i.e., TNN triplets)
Less Conservative
Have 3-6 target sequences (we're currently going for 8)
More backbones from non-zif268 than zif268
Pros:
We could get luck and find something no one has ever seen before (TNN, ANN). If we throw enough things at it, we're more likely to get luck.
Cons:
Risk: Many of these backbones (from entire ZF world)may NOT bind DNA (i.e., may bind proteins)
Risk: May not find anything that binds, then the whole project is a dud
What is the more important variable, helices or backbones?
Helices seem to be more important, backbones of secondary importance
Backbones: ZF's unravel DNA, open the major groove-- backbone is important here, changes the bond angle, etc. (Brandon's paper-??)
Balance needed between low and high risk
If we find backbones that we know bind DNA, greatly lowers our risk
Limited spaces on chip: zero-sum game
With a middle of the road approach, we diminish both benefits and risk (diminishes the benefits of the high risk approach much more than it diminishes the benefits of the conservative approach; i.e., if you're playing the lottery, you're more likely to win if you buy many more tickets)
We need to compare probabilities of randomly-generated OPEN sequences vs. probabilities of sequences randomly generated by our program
OPEN tries to cover all space: smaller probability
If we have a "smarter" algorithm, we can produce fewer
However,  the idea is not to repeat OPEN, but to go somewhere else, non-GNN sequences
Remember: OPEN is a Cell paper; the point of the project is not to compare ourselves to them
If we find binders for 1-2 of our sequences, that would be awesome
Probably we'll have some that find none, some have 10, our last one might have 1,000 hits (then, we do bioinformatics to figure out why/what those hits were)
Point: to learn and do high-level bioinformatics, and high-tech cloning techniques in the lab
If you do find binders, you can write a paper about it!
We have all the resources we need right now to build our chip
We need to pick out targets
Need to decide exactly what we want for:
No. of target sequences/which ones
No. of helices/ which ones
Ratio of zif268 backbones: non-zif268 backbones
Avoid switching Leucine out of position 4, then change other positions based on our frequencies
Chip Design
No. of sequences will be more than we can put on the chip
Helices: essentially unlimited
Put more-likely-to-bind helices into the risky backbones
Put less-likely-to-bind helices into a zif268 backbone
Backbones
Maybe revert to a more targeted approach: pick backbones that we know are transcription factors (TFs), that we know bind to DNA
OR research the ZFs from the phylogenetic tree
Pick clades to research, see if one looks better than the other
Why did OPEN cover so many helices, without changing the backbone, but still yield predominantly GNNs?
If we have an idea of how the backbone might affect binding, maybe we could look into some sort of low-level modeling, etc. so that we wouldn't be grasping? Could Vatsan help with this?
See 2000 Wolfe paper [1]
Backbones could affect interactions between fingers
Theory: energy penalty to ZF binding-- unravels DNA when binds to it
We have 12 target sequences
2 per 4 diseases, 4 for the 5th disease
If we want to be more conservative, we could throw out Type III, but it could be something cool
We should have mostly Type I (CoDA argument, if this is an F2)
Proposed: 3 diseases, 6 sequences
4 Type I (F3 and F2 known, F1 novel)
1 Type II (GNN, ANN, GNN)
1 Type III (All unknown, e.g., TNN, ANN, TNN;max 1)
Or, for 3 diseases:
Type I's
Type I, Type II
Type I, Type III
Clinical Targets
Colorblindness (Type I's)
Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) (1 in 500)
Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
Tay Sachs
KRAS- (oncogene/cancer)
Main goal of project: to build outside of what is already known
If we wanted to cure a disease only, we could just use existing ZFs (i.e., find GNN binding locations)
Also, we lend a level of specificity for insertion/deletion
There is the possibility that there might be some area where specificity might demand ANN codons
Current decision on chip design:
We will have 6 target sequences, 2 each from colorblindness, FH, and KRAS.  All are "Type I" targets (only F1 is novel) with the middle finger chosen from the CODA paper (either GNN or TNN)
N.B.: the CB and FH sequences make up full ZF nuclease cut sites. The KRAS sites, due to the small number of GNNTNN F3F2 combos available in CODA, are separate, with the flanking ZF nuclease site added afterwards in parentheses
GGTGGTAAG (CB)
GGAGTCCTG (FH)
GGCTGATGC (KRAS) (CTGAAAATT)
GGCTGACAC (FH)
GGCTGGAAT (KRAS) (GACAAGAGC)
GTCGCCTCC (CB)
Targets 3, 4, and 6 are similar to sequences Zif268 variants successfully bind to, so the backbones will be weighted accordingly:
Zif268_F2 backbone: 6000 helices (per target)
10 backbones more closely related to Zif268: 300 helices each
Targets 1, 2, and 5 will have equal distributions of backbones:
Zif268_F2: 3000 helices
10 backbones closely related to Zif268: 300 each
10 backbones more distantly related to Zif268: 300 each
Identifying dependencies
We looked at the probability graphs to determine which amino acid positions on the finger's helix interact with which bases.
Some interactions are fairly well estabilished, while others have been more recently proposed (See interaction map (Persikov 2011) )
To identify these interactions in our own data we looked at which helix positions varied most when you changed the bases. A more rigorous way to do this is to calculate the entropy change as you change the amino acids in each position.
xNN(Vary base 1): Amino acid 6 changes
NxN(Vary base 2): Amino acid 3 changes
NNx(Vary base 3): Amino acid -1 and 2(?) changes
Our program looks at dependencies between amino acids when generating sequences.
We decided on these amino acid dependencies, using both established data and patterns we saw in the OPEN data:
-1 and 2
2 and 1
6 and 5
Because there is not much data for 'CNN' and 'ANN' sequences (with 16 and 29 known fingers that bind to each triplet, respectively), we should use pseudocounts for these sequences, so that our frequency generator is not too biased toward probabilities that may not be significant.

Drier was unable to find a ZF that bound specifically to CTC. Instead he found zinc fingers that bound to CTC and other sequences with equal binding affinity.
Note: The green cells are the target sequences that we are aiming for on our chip.

In addition, we locked down the non-Zif268 backbones that we will be using for the chip.  We have 10 backbones that are more closely related to Zif268, and 10 that are more distantly related:

Updated Chip Design
The CODA article produced zinc fingers that bound a GNN or TNN F2 with either a ANN, GNN, or TNN F3. These results lead us to the following distribution of three types of zinc finger backbones (Zif268, similar but not equal to Zif268, and dissimilar to Zif268) across our 6 target DNA sequences. With 55,000 spaces on our chip, each of the 6 target DNA sequences is allotted 9,150 spaces with 100 spaces set aside for control zinc fingers from CODA and OPEN. Note that the values in the table below represent the number of helices inserted into each type of backbone.

N.B.: The chip will only be holding our F1 zinc fingers- the F2 and F3 will be on a separate plasmid that we must make ourselves
To Do: The distribution of helices to each backbone set/target sequence needs to be finalized. For example, the program can generate a set of helices for the Zif268 backbone to be applied to the colorblindness target sequence, but should the same set or a completely different helix set be applied to the Zif268 backbones for the familial hypercholesterolemia target sequences?
If we want to test the effect of the backbone, would need to keep the helices constant-- but we could do this within a single target, to keep all other variables constant
Finishing the generator
We finished and finalized the program that generates zinc finger sequences. The following changes were made today:
We incorporated the data from Persikov's database into out generator.
We included the ability to remove duplicate sequences in the output file (with a dictionary).
We added pseudocounts for fingers that bind to 'ANN' or 'CNN' targets. Because there is not much information for these targets, the data we do have may be biased. Thus, we want to make sure that amino acids that currently have no probability of occurring are bumped up to a minimum (currently 0.01).
We placed additional weight on non zif-268 backbones. Formerly, the amino acids for positions 1, 4, and 5 were fixed based on zif-268 data, regardless of the original helix sequences on these backbones. Now information from both zif-268 and the original helix sequence is considered when assigning weights to the amino acids.
We started working with Noah's reverse translate program.
We tested our generator to ensure that the sequences it was producing appeared to be legitimate.
Jamie looked at the multiple sequence alignments of the fingers generated, so see if the frequencies correlated with what we expected them to be. (?)
We input a known DNA triplet to see if the program generated sequences known to bind, according to OPEN data. When generating 10000 sequences, about half the known binders for the input triplet were found.
We created WebLogos to more easily visualize how adding the Persikov data affects the sequences we generate. The size of the letters correspond to the frequency of that amino acid in that position. We decided to incorporate the Persikov data so that our generator incorporates more information when generating sequences. Doing so does not drastically change the sequences generated.

Ran gel to determine the results of the PCR products
Determined the HisB presence in selection strain
Finalized the presence of hisB through the gel image below
Determined the success of the pZE21G backbone primers through gel on gradient PCR
PCR for the backbone failed again, even done through gradient PCR
PCR of HisB locus
PCR more Kan-ZFB-His3-Ura3
Two 50 µL reactions
Doubled the protocol used on the 16th and used HisUraKan_F and ZFBwpHisUra_R primers
PCR produced very low concentration of Kan-ZFG-His3-Ura3 because melting temperature of primer was too high, so primers stuck to annealing DNA and did not dissociate
In image below the low concentration of desired product can be seen, along with the high concentration of unused primers
PCR of kan-ZFB-wp-his3-ura3
Ran gel of initial overlap PCR product (undiluted, starting without primers) from June 16th, using whole sample
Performed gel extraction in order to have more Kan-ZFB-His3-Ura3 product for the transformation tomorrow: 8.5ng/µL, 260/280=2.03
Determined success of the selection construct transformation
Checked the plates all day,and finally came to the conclusion that the transformation did not work
Discovered that lambda red has a promoter induced by arabinose, not temperature (though the strain is still temperature sensitive). That is why it didn't work--we'll get arabinose and hopefully have a successful recombination.
Preparing all parts for transformation today and will finish it tomorrow
Oligo Design for MAGE
Designed 90bp long oligos for OZ052 and OZ123 insertion in the ZFB sites in place of Zif268. Reverse complement taken.
Miniprep pZE21G plasmid for backbone PCR
Ran miniprep again for pZE21G plasmid: 6ng/µL, 260/280=2
Worried that the miniprep didn't work: ran gel also on this miniprep and concluded that DNA was present in the sample
Gel image seen below
pZE21G miniprep
Ran PCR for pZE21G backbone
Used same protocol from June 22 in PCR today for pZE21G backbone
