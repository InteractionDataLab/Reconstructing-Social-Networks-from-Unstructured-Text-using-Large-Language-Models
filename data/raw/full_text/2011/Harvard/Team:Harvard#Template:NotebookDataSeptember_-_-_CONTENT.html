</P><P>After the CB bottom library was transformed into <B>(turbocomp or selection strain?)</B> cells, 94 colonies were picked off of the plate after transformation.  These colonies were then sequenced, with the eventual objective of determining several factors about our transformed library:
</P><UL><LI>How much spread does our library cover?  Theoretically, the 94 colonies should be evenly spread throughout the 9,150 chip sequences, and the likelihood of a given sequence being represented twice is very low.
</LI><LI>Additionally, are the backbones being represented after transformation in the same ratios as they are on the chip?
</LI></UL><LI>What are the chip error rates?  The process of synthesizing the chip is error-prone, but we do not know what percentage of the oligos on the chip contain errors.  These errors can be SNPs or frameshifts from insertions/deletions.
</LI><P>Currently, the sequencing files are all located under sequences/CB bottom insert seq 08292011.
</P><P>29 sequences were analyzed by hand by importing the sequence files into SeqBuilder and manually identifying the position of the F1 motif based on its translation.
</P><P>Out of these 29 sequences, 6 showed a frameshift mutation, causing the F1 and F2/F3 to be expressed in different reading frames.  This indicates that based on these results, roughly 20% of the oligos on the chip contain frameshift mutations.  This may be ok, due to the remaining 80% being available.  The mutated oligos will simply be dropped out of the pool during selection due to creation of a nonfunctional protein.
</P><P>Furthermore, 2 of the 29 sequences contained SNPs.  One of them changed the F in &quot;FQCRICMRN&quot; to an S, while the other SNP introduced an early stop codon into the zinc finger, also making it non-functional.
</P><P>Out of the 94 colonies that were sequenced, 20 of the traces were sufficiently poor quality that no F1 was identified.
</P><P>For the future, we will need to create a script that will compare the sequenced results to the actual chip database.  This can be accomplished with the following steps:
</P><OL><LI>Perform restriction cuts on the chip in silico, that is, manually edit out the primer tag/type II binding site, leaving only the part that encodes the F1 finger.  This will be the dictionary that we will use to check all of our sequences against.
</LI><LI>Parse the sequencing data by identifying the part that codes for F1.  This can be accomplished with regular expressions.  One would need to identify the end of the omega/F1 linker (the last 30 or so nucleotides) and the beginning of the F1/F2 linker (the first 30 nucleotides).  Everything in between can be assumed to be F1 material.
</LI><LI>The program will then check to see if the F1 that is parsed from the sequencing data exists in the dictionary.  If it does, that is great.  If it does not, it will do one of two things:
</LI><LI>Perform a modulus 3 operation to see if there was a frameshift.  If the F1 is not a multiple of 3, it can be assumed that a frameshift occured.
</LI><LI>Look for the closest entry in the dictionary to the errant sequence (something off by 1 nucleotide, for example)
</LI></OL>
This will allow us to automate our efforts, and will make it easier when more sequencing is performed.  Vatsan recommends using BioPython to write the script.</DIV><DIV id="907" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="September_7">September 7</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="File_Processing_for_Library_Sequencing">File Processing for Library Sequencing</SPAN></H3><P>Preliminary processing of the library sequences consists of agreggating the 94 individual fasta files into one multifasta file (which will be easier to work with) and taking the reverse complements of all the sequences (since we used a reverse primer for sequencing, the 100_bp_junction primer).
</P><P>A Python script for converting fasta into multifasta can be found here: <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/f2m2f/" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A>, and a website for converting a multifasta file into its reverse complement can be found here: <A href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~stothard/javascript/rev_comp.html" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</A>.
</P><P>The reverse complement multifasta file for the 94 sequences thus far can be found in the dropbox under sequences/CB bottom insert seq 08292011 with the name CB bottom seq multifasta RC.fasta.
</P>
Remaining efforts include parsing the file to extract the F1 subunits, which will require either removing the newline characters and using regex or by using a regex that can recognize sequences across multiple lines (i.e. regex that recognizes sequences with newline characters randomly in there).  The chip dictionary still needs to be built and the code for comparing our sequences with the dictionary also still needs to be written.</DIV><DIV id="908" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="September_8th">September 8th</SPAN></H2><UL><LI>Biobricks:
</LI><LI>The plates looked good: the plates with the omega-ZF and ZFB-his3-ura3 inserts had many more colonies than the pSB1C3 self-ligation control.
</LI><LI>Chose 4 colonies from each biobrick and will grow them overnight. Tomorrow they will be miniprepped and sent out for sequencing using the standard primers on the backbone. (This should cover the entire insert for omega-ZF and most of the insert for ZFB-his3-ura3.)
</LI></UL><LI>Selection strains:
</LI><LI>Streaked out fresh plates from the glycerol stocks of the EcNR2 selection strain with the various zinc finger binding sites. We will hopefully use these when the other libraries are assembled (and we can use the CB bottom colonies for a fresh transformation with its library).</LI></DIV><DIV id="911" style="display:none"><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="September_11th">September 11th</SPAN></H2><UL><LI>CB bottom ZFB strain:
