We will try a few different approaches to increase our PCR product.  All these reactions were done only with 3:11P (since 2:17H showed no product in the gradient).
</P><P>1) Gel Stab PCR:
</P><UL><LI>We ran out more of the gradient PCR product (see image below) and used it as the template for a new PCR
</LI><LI>Gel stab went into 20µL H2O; 66 C annealing, 3 min elongation; pSB4K5_F+ZFBhl and pSB4K5_R+URA3hl primers
</LI><LI>Results: unsuccessful. Perhaps the gel stab did not give an adequate amount of template.

</P><UL><LI>Because the primer initially anneals with 20 bases and then with 60, we will start with a low annealing temperature and then raise it as the overlapping region grows.
</LI><LI>58-66 C annealing, changing 1 degree per cycle (9 cycles); the rest of the 25 cycles were done at 66 C
</LI><LI>3 min elongation
</LI><LI>Results: one of the four reactions worked. This is very strange since the reactions should have been identical.
</LI></UL><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">pSB4K5 reverse touchdown 8/1/11</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>3) Template concentration gradient PCR:
</P><UL><LI>The primer dimers may have been forming since there wasn't enough template to compete with the primer-primer interactions.
</LI><LI>All reagents were kept the same except template: 1µL, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, or 4µL were used
</LI><LI>66 C anneal, 3 min elongation
</LI><LI>Results: only one of the reactions worked. We did use the gradient cycler which has not always worked well for us. We also noticed that when we removed the tubes from the cycler, most of the liquid had condensed on the lids.

</P><UL><LI>Since our original gradient seemed to have been one of the more successful ways, we will repeat it but with a tighter temperature range
</LI><LI>Normal KAPA protocol, annealing 65-69 C, 3 min elongation
</LI></UL><P><B>ZFB-wp-his3-ura3:</B></P><UL><LI>For isothermal assembly we need a high concentration of each of the DNA components, so we decided to PCR more of our ZFB-wp-his3-ura3 insert and use the Qiagen Minelute kit to purify.
</LI><LI>primers: ZFB-wp-f and ZFB+kan_short_R; ZFB-wp-hisura template

</LI><LI>NM+his: both selection strain and pSR01 grew, but the selection strain grew faster. This might just be an artifact from having accidentally added more cells to the selection strain than the pSR01 wells, but it may also show that the pSR01 strain grows slower. Another possibility is that we are expressing enough zinc fingers for it to be slightly toxic for the cells. Next time maybe we should let the plate reader go for longer than 16 hours just in case the cells need more time.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>NM: selection strain does not grow, while pSR01 does a perfect rescue!
</LI></UL><UL><LI>pSR01 HARV3-AT comparison: the concentration of 3-AT does not seem to make a difference in the growth curves (the differences appear to be due to different wells starting with slightly different amounts of cells). Next time we can try a higher 3-AT concentration, but since we expect Zif268 to bind strongly this might just be what you get.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>NM+his+IPTG: IPTG more or less killed the pSR01 cells but not the selection strain. This may be caused by too many zinc fingers being expressed, so we may want to try less IPTG.

After talking with our teammates, we realized that we had been performing the reaction on single stranded DNA, instead of our double stranded PCR product. We performed the digestion again today with oligos 1 and 2, using the following recipe:
</P><UL><LI>15 ul DNA
</LI><LI>0.5 ul enzyme
</LI><LI>85 ul buffer/BSA 
</LI></UL><P>After letting the reaction sit at 37* for about 45 minutes, we performed a PCR purification, and then ran the product on a gel:
</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">We could see bands of the appropriate size, after digesting our PCR product. Unpure = cut without PCR purification.</DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Finally, we had gotten bands at the appropriate size! We noticed that there were multiple bands smaller than our uncut oligo. We figured the smallest band was the one we were looking for. The one that was slightly larger was likely the result of the enzyme only cutting at one end of our oligo. We wondered whether all of our product would have been the appropriate size if we had let the reaction sit at 37* for a longer period of time. Regardless, we decided to use this product in our ligation reaction. If both ends of the oligo aren't cut, then it should not be able to bind with the backbone.
</P><P>We performed a ligation reaction with our cut CB Bottom and our digested oligos, using the following recipe:
</P><UL><LI>5 ul ligation mix
</LI><LI>4 ul backbone (~20 ng/ul)
</LI><LI>1 ul insert (~15 ng/ul)
</LI></UL><P>This would leave to a vector to insert ratio of 1 to 8, which is what is normally used for ligation reactions. 
</P><P>This is how we calculated the amounts of inserted needed for our ligation:
</P><PRE>PCR product: ~60 ng/ul
We want 1 ug of DNA to be cut, so that after the PCR purification, when we elute in 30 ul we will get a concentration of ~30 ng/ul.
</PRE><P>In practice, we end up losing some of our product, so we ended up with 15 ng/ul. 
</P><P>After letting the reaction sit at room temperature for 1 hour, we transformed ChemComp bacteria with the ligation products. We plated 50 ul and 400 ul of the transformation and left the plates at 37* overnight.
