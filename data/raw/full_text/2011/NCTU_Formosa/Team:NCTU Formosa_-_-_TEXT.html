Abstract
As one of the main challenges of in vivo experiments is controlling the flux   through a synthetic  metabolic pathway, it’s design lies in selecting well-  matched genetic components that when coupled, can reliably produce the desired   behavior. Although model equations can calculate parameter values, a challenge   still remains in selecting the bio-bricks that can reliably implement a desired   cellular function with quantitative values. In previous studies, synthetic   biologists have created numerous synthetic circuits; each generating different   protein expression levels in order to test performance in reliability and   consistency, but this process is both tedious and time consuming. To overcome   this problem, our team designed a novel circuit design: method_ Pathway   Commander. By this design method, we construct a single version of a synthetic   metabolic pathway circuit that can use culture temperature shifts to control the   expression levels of a series of metabolic proteins at the precise times. We have   implemented the Pathway_Commander design in (1) Carotenoid synthesis Pathway, (2)   Violacein biosynthesis pathways and (3) Butanol synthesis pathway in E. coli.   This circuit design utilizes a temperature controlled system that gives precision   control over metabolic protein expression which amounts to optimize the synthesis that   can maximize synthesis of a given compound or drug.
