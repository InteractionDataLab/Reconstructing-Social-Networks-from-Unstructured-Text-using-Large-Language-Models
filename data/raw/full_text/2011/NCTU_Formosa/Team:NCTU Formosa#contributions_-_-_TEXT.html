Shu-Han is one of the group leader in our team.She leads one of our group which responsible for the Violacein pathway and certain part of the Butanol pathway. Most of the circuits were sucessfully assembled under her lead. Her responsible include organizing the group’s experiment schedule in order to face the unknown successive potential of the plasmid digestion and ligation. She is also one of our team members that direct our “E-coli clay train” short film. Along with the other members, She wrote the Violacein Pathway wiki page and send the assembled parts along with its details.
Shu-Han Chang
Our Butanol Pathway wiki page is written by Yi-Ying. She's one of team members who's responsible for assembling the Violacein and Butanol Pathway circuits. Together with Feng-Shuo Pai and Chia-Jui Liu, they prepare all the experimental needs such as LB plates, LB tubes and the electrophoresis gels for our team. She is also one of our team members that direct our “E-coli clay train” short film.
Yi-Ying Chiu
Ying-Rou is responsible for assembling the circuits of Violacein and Butanol Pathway. She is also one of our team members that directed our “E-coli clay train” short film. Along with the other members, She wrote our Violacein Pathway wiki page. Along With her partner, they dealt with all our accomodation and went to find sponsors for all our needs in order to join the 2011 IGEM competition.
Ying-Jou Chang
Malvin is responsible for assembling the circuits of Violacein and Butanol Pathway. He is also one of our team members that directed our “E-coli clay train” short film. Along with the other members, he wrote our Violacein Pathway wiki page.
Malvin Jefri
He is responsible for assembling the Violacein and Butanol Pathway circuits. Together with Feng-Shuo Pai and Yi-Ying Chiu , they prepare all the experimental needs such as LB plates, LB tubes and the electrophoresis gels for our team. He helped a lot in our team’s presentation slides which we use for IGEM Competition.
Chia-Jui Liu
I am responsible for assembling the circuits of Carotenoid synthesis pathway and Butanol Pathway. I also test the function of cI repressed promoter by Flow cytometer and the production of butanol by Gas chromatography.  Archive and modify the content of wiki. Write the wiki of Introduction.
