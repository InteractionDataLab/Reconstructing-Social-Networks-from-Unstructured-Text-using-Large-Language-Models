Hi,I am CHIA-JUI LIU.Now I major in Biology Technology in National Chiao-Tung University. In fact,the igem competition is a really tiring thing.During the preparing of igem, we had to work hard and experiment again and again. But I still join this competition because I can learn more biotechnology knowledge which is useful for me. I believe joining igem will  be unique experience in my life time.
