Gas chromatography (GC) Protocol
Method:
Culture samples were centrifuged (12500×g, 25°C, 5 min), and the supernatants were analyzed for isobutanol. Isobutanol products were analyzed by GC equipped with flame ionization detector(FID) and a 50-m Ultra-2 column (Hewlett Packard, USA). The separation of alcohol compounds was carried out with a EQUity capirally column (SUPELCO, 60 m; 0.32 mm inside diameter; 1.0 μm film thickness). Filtrated samples were injected in split injection mode (1:10 split ratio).Nitrogen (constant flow 1 mL/min) was used as a carrier gas. The temperature of the injector was 150 °C. The oven program was as follows: 40°C ramp to 100 °C at 20 °C/min, 100 °C for 1 min, ramp to 130 °C at 15 °C/min, 130°C for 4 min.
