He is the Coordinator of the CUHK iGEM team.  Research mainly focuses in genomics and bioinformatics of microbial pathogens and complex human phenotypes.  He enjoys talking about science, but even more so for toys: Mindstorms NXT, RX-178, 5D Mk-II, LX200-ACF, YAS-875EX, and iGEM.  Wishing his students would comprehend the fun and excitement of all aforementioned, but if that is not possible then at the very least, iGEM.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="instructor"><H3>Prof. Chan King Ming</H3><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Dr. King Ming Chan is an Associate Professor of School of Life Sciences and Director of Environmental Science Program, Faculty of Science, Chinese University. His research focuses on Aquatic Toxicology and Molecular Endocrinology using fish models. Recent studies are mainly on transgenic fish over-expressing somatolactin hormone for functional study and use of biomarkers of exposures to study the risk of environmental contaminants including pesticides, trace organics, nanoparticles, and metal ions in waters. Dr. Chan also studies the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and transcription, focusing on understanding how metal-regulatory-element-binding transcription factors  (MTFs) control metallothionein genes and how <I>Pit-1s</I> control pituitary polypeptide hormone genes.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="instructor"><TABLE><H3>Prof. Kong Siu Kai</H3><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Dr. SK Kong is a Professor in the School of Life Sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). In the Biochemistry programme, Dr. Kong is responsible for the immunology, fluorescence techniques and clinical biochemistry teaching. Dr. Kong's research interests are (1) to identify the mechanisms how cancer cells bypass the cell death programme to develop immortality and drug-resistance, (2) to learn how erythrocytes perform the cell death program without the involvement of mitochondria, lysosomes and other organelles and (3) to develop biosensors using novel technologies. This is the 2nd year that SKK joined the CUHK iGEM team.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="instructor"><H3>Prof. Kevin Yuk-Lap Yip</H3><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Dr. Kevin Yip is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). He has been researching in the field of bioinformatics for 8 years, since he was a graduate student first in Hong Kong and later at Yale University. He is particularly interested in modeling and studying the interactions of biological objects in large-scale networks, such as protein-protein interaction, gene regulatory and metabolic networks. His major role in the CUHK iGEM team is to introduce the competition to engineering students, recruit interested and committed individuals, and help them enrich the engineering aspects of the project.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="instructor"><H3>Ho Frankie Tsoi</H3><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Frankie is currently a fourth-year PhD student at CUHK.

Some of you might have heard of me before. Yep, I have taken part in iGEM Hong Kong-CUHK team last year. I have done my final year undergraduate study and I’m now doing my graduate research, specializing on bio-sensor and cancer-related. My personal dream is to meet friends from everywhere of the world, learn the culture, know their stories, and experience their lives. If you share the same interest, welcome to find me anytime! Surely, my previous dream is still a dream. Go click <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK/Team_students">this website</A> to take a look on what my previous dream is!</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="instructor"><H3>Qin Hao</H3><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Hi, I’m Brian from biochemistry of CUHK, one of the instructors of our iGEM team this year. I’m so glad to be one part of the competition this year and I would like to make friends with you. iGEM is so interesting that we can realize our own dream with magic bacteria during the competition. Hopefully we could share fascinating ideas through this competition.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV><DIV class="span-24" style="text-align:left;"><P>&quot;Creativity is thinking up new things.
