Team Description
If you have been interested in the iGEM competition, you probably have noticed that this is the second year that the Chinese University of Hong Kong as one of the participating teams in the world-renowned iGEM competition. We are pleased to have formed a team of 24 undergraduates, of various majors of Science faculty and Engineering faculty. The team is guided by a handful of instructors and supervisors. It is sub-divided into three groups each focusing on one of the aspects of the work, namely characterization, cloning and modeling. Through all hard work preparing for iGEM, we understand much more about Synthetic Biology and we believe the public should also learn more about its principles and benefits to the society. Finally, we hope that all participants will enjoy and have fun in the jamboree!
