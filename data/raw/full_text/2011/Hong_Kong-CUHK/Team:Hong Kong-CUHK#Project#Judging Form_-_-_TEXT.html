Team:
Hong_Kong-CUHK
Region:
Asia
Track:
Foundational Advance
iGEM Year:
2011
Project Name:
ChloriColight
Project Abstract:
"Control  of gene switch by phototuning
Conventional induction systems usually involve addition of a chemical agent  that functions either by turning on or off an output event, which is  equivalent to flipping an on/off switch. In our project, we aim to replace  such analog system with a phototunable cascade, which can trigger a  measurable output (e.g. gene expression) according to the wavelengths,  intensities, and durations of a light source in a quantitative manner. In the  long run, this system could be further modified to convert light into other  types of output, such as osmolality and electric current."
iGEM Medals for Non-Software Teams
We believe our team deserves the following medal:  ✓Bronze ✓Silver ✓Gold
Because we met the following criteria (check all that apply and provide details where needed)
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
✓Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
✓Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2011 Judging form.
✓Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
✓Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✓Enter information detailing at least one newstandard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
✓Primary nucleic acid sequence
✓Description of function
✓Authorship
✓Safety notes, if relevant.
✓Acknowledgment of sources and references
✓Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
✓Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
✓Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry
Part Number(s): BBa_K559000 , BBa_K559010
 
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (One or More)
☐Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
✓Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
  Link to this information on your wiki.
Page name: Team:Hong_Kong-CUHK/Laboratory/collaboration
✓Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing and innovation.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Regional Jamborees. The special prizes include Best Wiki, BestPoster, Best Presentation, Best New BioBrick Part (Natural or Engineered). To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
✓Best Human Practice Advance
✓Best Experimental Measurement
☐Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these three special prizes:
Precise measurement of the efficiency and optimization of the innovative applications with our biobricks has been done. Furthermore, the phototuning ability of our biobricks' applications has also been measured. Measurement of biobrick performance was carried out to make it a regulated system.
For human practice, a risk assessment report had been achieved and we followed all the standard biological practices with safety level 2. Therefore, we aim to emphasize the importance of safety as well as to raise the awareness of the public to biological safety.
Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Part Number(s):  BBa_K559000 ,  BBa_K559010
Your team has listed these parts as your team favorites:
 
iGEM Safety
For iGEM 2011 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
The iGEM judges expect that you have answered the four safety questions on your iGEM 2011 wiki.

Attributions and Contributions
For iGEM 2011 the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors.
