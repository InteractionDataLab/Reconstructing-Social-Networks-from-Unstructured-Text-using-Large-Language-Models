It is my pleasure to take part in iGEM competition. Through this competition, I have a glimpse of what synthetic biology is, which I found it very interesting and new because it is about delving into Biology with the engineering perspective. What is more is that I enjoy being in our team because my teammates are very nice and tolerant. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing squash and chatting with my friends. I hope that through our hard work these days, we can draw peoples’ attention on the development of the science field in Hong Kong to pursue the truth of nature and our world.

I am studying Biochemistry at the moment. I am interested in everything about the biological world. I enjoy watching documentaries via TV channels at home. I also love listening to pop music, sleeping and dreaming at leisure. IGEM offers me a chance to better understand the scientific world and a chance to broaden my horizon. I have learned a lot about synthetic biology which is an emerging Science and have got much chance to practice the wet-lab techniques that I learned. I strongly believe that the experience accumulated will help in the pursuit of my career. I have had a wonderful time working in the team and I am glad to be one of the members. Hope we can get a fruitful result!   </P></DIV><DIV class="student"><DIV><UL><LI>Full name: Lau Pak Ho</LI><LI>English Nickname: Angus</LI><LI>Programme of study: Biochemistry</LI><LI>Contributions: Molecular Cloning, Poster Content</LI></UL></DIV><P>Hello guys! I am Angus, a bachelor student of Biochemistry in The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am glad to join the iGEM this year. It let me know more about synthetic biology which is a field that I didn’t know well before. It also gives me a great opportunity to participate in such an international scientific event as an undergraduate. From coming up the ideas of the project to wet-lab, and any challenges that we have ever met, I really learn many things and enjoy them. In the coming months, I hope our team can keep holding on to strive for our goal, to join the world championship jamboree.</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><DIV><UL><LI>Full name: Pun Chun Wing</LI><LI>English nickname: Carl</LI><LI>Programme of study: Electronic Engineering</LI><LI>Contributions: Modeling, Nano Electrode Fabrication and Characterization, Power Management</LI></UL></DIV><P>Hi Hi Everyone!

I’m Gordon, a year 2 undergraduate student of Biochemistry at CUHK. Since I was a child I was fascinated by numerous amazing scientific discoveries and inventions. Science has always been my favorite subject and the idea of participating in a scientific competition is very appealing to me. iGEM is a golden opportunity for me to learn stuff outside the school’s curriculum such as wet-lab, writing, leadership, social, statistical analysis and presentation skills. The workload can be quite high but it was a worthy experience since iGEM helps to develop my perseverance. It is thrilling to use state-of-the-art instruments that are seldom used by undergraduate students. I’m looking forward to seeing other cool stuff by other teams and that the biobricks will one day contribute to the society. </P></DIV><DIV class="student"><DIV><UL><LI>Full name: Hau Irons Tak Yan

</LI></UL></DIV><P>iGEM offers me opportunities to explore life sciences in a practical basis, in particularly on wet-lab technique and integration between life sciences and engineering. This is so much more fun than just reading textbook to learn. And it is a precious chance for me to know and work with people from different discipline.

</LI></UL></DIV><P>Hi everyone. I’m a second-year biochemistry student at CUHK. I studied biochemistry because I love looking into small things to see how a large system works. I was at first attracted by IGEM’s idea to allow us to develop our own project and share interesting research topics with university students around the world and joined IGEM 2011. It’s also very interesting to be able to manipulate the bacteria to do what we ask them to do. Can’t wait to meet teams around the world at the Jamboree to know about their results!

This subject is kinda new in CUHK, I'm the only CMB student in the igem team, hope there would be more next year. One day Gordon Chan asked me “Do you want fame in your undergradutate life?”. And that's how I end up in the igem team. And my idea of using halorodophsin was finally accepted in this year's CUHK igem team. Basically I'm interest about everything revolving around how science makes people live better – Engineering, technologies, ergonomic, you name it!</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><DIV><UL><LI>Full name: Tse Ka Hong

You know what, I’ve been falling in love with Biology since I studied in high school. With this passion, you definitely urge to not only know as much corresponding knowledge as you can through taking courses or reading, but also equip yourself with various practical experiences for bring your creations from mind to your everyday life in the future! Igem, for sure, gives me a chance to learn to put theory into practice. With the guidance of professors, instructors and supports from our teammates, I’ve really learnt a lot! What I can say is this is one of a valuable experience I’ve ever had. Thanks everyone. :)

</LI></UL></DIV><P>Hi! I am sally, a year 2 student studying Food and Nutritional Sciences. It is my pleasure to be one of the participants in the iGEM competition this year.  I remember that at the beginning, the term “Synthetic biology” is not familiar to me, what I know about synthetic biology is that it is a combination of biology and engineering. Thanks to this competition, my knowledge of synthetic biology is now enriched. Moreover, this competition gives me a precious chance to learn lots of wet-lab technique and more importantly, gives me an opportunity to meet and work with my nice teammates! The iGEM competition will begin soon and I am looking forward to meeting all the teams from around the world.

This is Sam@ee.cuhk.edu.hk (not an email address actually). The power management circuit that was built easily didn't pass endurance testing (we charged the supercap overnight and its voltage still stayed flat on some low voltage=.=&quot;, the reason is that the metal clamps are faulty and they just went off or lose contact over some time, and that was frustrating since we took weeks to isolate the problem=.=). Nevertheless, I enjoy being in the team and tackling problems with helpful hints from instructors. The fun of this competition is that even though deadlines were tight and it seemed lots of things are yet to be done, we still be able to keep everything in check.

I am glad to join the competition for the second time. iGEM is still as fascinating as I joined first time. Its inter-disciplinary nature captures my heart. Where else can we see programmers learn to do wetlab and vice versa besides iGEM? In iGEM I learnt a lot of knowledge that goes far beyond my major, chemistry. iGEM also made me tougher. Doing lab work is tedious yet it is so rewarding when I get nice data.</P></DIV><DIV class="student"><DIV><UL><LI>Full name: Hoi Ian Tong</LI><LI>English nickname: Vicki</LI><LI>Programme of study: Food and Nutritional Sciences</LI><LI>Contributions: Graphic Design, Name Card Design, Poster Design, Wiki Design</LI></UL></DIV><P>Hello.

Hi, I am Winnie, a year 2 student of Biomedical Engineering at CUHK. As a member of the modeling team, it is hard but fun experience of applying engineering knowledge to synthetic biology. In the iGEM project, I managed to draw 3D animations with the uncontrollable Autodesk Maya, the software used for the movie Avatar. In the future, I aim to produce a 3D Bio-fiction movie. I am a person that enjoys the exuberance liveliness of student life and have a deep interest in vulgar poems. If you regard me as a graceful and quiet lady, you are wrongly mistaken.
