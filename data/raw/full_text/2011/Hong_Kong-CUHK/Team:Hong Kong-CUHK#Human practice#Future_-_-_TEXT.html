Future perspectives in Human Practice
Given an understanding that human practice plays a crucial role in synthetic biology, we are devoted to organizing it by actively taking part in a series of activities to promote the ethical and safety issue of synthetic biology. In the nearer future, we would also like to expand our scope more extensively and broadly.
To further promote synthetic biology, our iGEM team can convey messages further and extensively by holding a science fair “Synthetic biology fun fair”. It is proposed that in the science fair, we could show some laboratory demonstrations such as running gel electrophoresis and spreading plates to allow the public to have a first glimpse of part of the works we have done for the project. Besides, in the science fair, forum and talks could be given to the public so as to introduce them with the synthetic biology and our project idea, and to provide rooms of discussion for the ethical issue it raised.
In Hong Kong, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks holds a large-scale InnoCarnival every year in which it is open to public and society with regardless of their backgrounds and ages. In the InnoCarnival, it allows different institutes and organizations to share their scientific findings and technologies to public. We would be grasping this precious opportunity in the future to raise the public awareness on synthetic biology by setting a booth and holding activities there. And we believe this would spread the messages to the public about the advancing technology in Hong Kong.
Other than advocating the importance of synthetic biology through website, we would also like to distribute a leaflet in the street in the nearer future. In the leaflet, it is proposed to include some basic introduction of synthetic biology and our project title, as well as the ethical matter of synthetic biology to allow the public to bear the thought of nowadays moral issue of technology and get a better understanding on this issue.
With our dedication to promoting the synthetic biology and moral issues, we are aspired to put our best feet forward in organizing activities related to the synthetic biology in the near future to pave the path for the all-round development of technology in Hong Kong.
