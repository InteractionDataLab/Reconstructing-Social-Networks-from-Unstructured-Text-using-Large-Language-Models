SHHO College General Education Forum
High School talk
SHHO College General Education Forum
Brandon, our team leader, held a presentation in front of all the SHHO college students during the College General Education Forum.  The presentation covered the applications of Synthetic Biology as well as its advantages, followed by equal emphasis on the issue of safety. To sooth the worries from the public on Synthetic Biology, e.g. the use of bacteria and the safety of genetic engineering, he talked about precautionary measures taken by the synthetic biologists.
The talk was ended with enthusiastic applause from the floor with very positive feedback. Audience was fascinated with what sytnthetic biology could achieve.

Onthe 3rd October 2011, 4 members from our team held a talk in Leung Shek Chee College, a local secondary school, lasting for about an hour.
In the talk, they introduced the very basics of synthetic biology, iGEM competition, as well as our project idea along with ethical concerns. Through the talk, we aimed to arouse their interests in synthetic biology and provide them with spaces for the discussion on the novel way of studying science.
At the end of the talk, feedbacks were collected from students. All of them reflected that they understood more about synthetic biology. Half of them showed greater acceptance of Synthetic Biology. Only a small proportion thought that it is safe to put synthetic biology in practice, however.
In general, they found the presentation interesting and informative.
