Collaboration
We are glad to cooperate with HKUST-Hong_Kong on modeling the hypothetical behavior of bcr gene induced by lac or T7. bcr is amembrane protein that actively pumps out a variety of substrates from the cell, notably antibiotics such as tetracycline and kanamycin. Hence, expression of bcr leads to antibiotic resistance. The collaboration was established because of the similarity between halorhodopsin and bcr. Both proteins are membrane transporters, and we are familiar with such scenario.
 
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is acommonly-used indicator to measure the vulnerability of bacteria in presence of antibiotics. It is usually determined by the minimum concentration of antibiotics that could cause observable reduction in turbidity (optical density) for an overnight LB culture. We modeled the relationships between the change of MIC of tetracycline and kanamycin respectively and the concentration of IPTG, which induces bcr downstream of Plac in E. coli. The change of MIC is reported as the ratio of the MIC of bcr-transformed E.coli over that of wildtype E. coli.
 
Modeling results
Fig. 1  lac promoter activity. Curve is fit by one-site total binding model from experimental data [3], [4].
Fig. 2  Activity of native promoter [1] of bcr (acrAp+acrBp) vs. change in MIC. Curve is fit by one-site total binding model from experimental data [2], [5].
Fig. 3  Change in MIC vs. IPTG (lac promoter construct). Blue line represents tetracycline and red line represents kanamycin.
Fig. 4  Change in MIC (effect of using T7 promoter). Data are obtained from [6] and using one-site total binding model for curve fitting.
We modeled HKUST’s data with three assumptions. Firstly, antibiotics are applied during exponential phase or stationary phase. Secondly, Plac only affects the expression of target genes (bcr). Finally, IPTG doesn’t affect other metabolic pathways except Plac induction. We modeled the activity of Plac under different IPTG concentrations(Fig. 1) and the relationship between the activity of native promoter of bcr and the MIC change (Fig. 2). Then we achieved our goal to show the effect of IPTG concentration on the change of MIC by combining the Placactivity and the MIC change of wild type bcr (Fig. 3). We discovered that only a small amount of IPTG is essential to induce bcr and trigger similar antibiotic resistance compared with wild type. However, further increase of IPTG concentration has limited effect on strengthening antibiotic resistance. This is probably due to the saturation of IPTG in bcr induction where the bcr amount reaches the peak, while the concentration of antibiotics keeps increasing.
