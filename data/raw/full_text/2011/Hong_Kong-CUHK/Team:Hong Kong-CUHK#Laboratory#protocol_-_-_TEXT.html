PCR Purification
 
- *Protocol
1) Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix. It is not        necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene.
2) If pH indicator I has been added to Buffer PB, check that the color of the mixture is yellow. If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow.
3)Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
4) To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60s.
5)Discard flow-through. Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
6) To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
7)Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube. Centrifugethe column for an additional 1 min. Protocol
8)Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
9) To elute DNA, add 50 μl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min. Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 μl elution buffer to thecenter of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge.
10) If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to
5 volumes of purified DNA. Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick
membrane for complete elution of bound DNA. The average eluate volume is 48 µl
from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl elution buffer.
*Protocol adopted from QIAquick PCR purification kit protocol
 
 
 
Agarose Gel electrophoresis
 
- Set gel
1) Dissolve 0.55g Agarose into 55ml 0.5X TBE buffer.
2) Microwave (high power, 800W) for 1 minute.
3) Cool it down using running water for 1 minute.
4) Add 1μl GelRed
5)Pour the solution to tightened tank with gates and gel comb and allow it to solidify.
6)Transfer the gel to gel tank once it is set hard.
 
-Run gel
1)Orient the gel with wells facing the black negative electrode. Check if the gel is covered by TBE buffer in the tank. If not, add TBE buffer to cover it to about 1mm.
2) Mix loading dye and the insert/plasmid before adding to the wells. For example, if the DNA we have got is 45μl, and the loading dye we have got is 10X, then add 5μl of loading dye to the samples. Mixture should be in blue.
3)To run the gel, add all samples to the wells of gel. Then add 1kb DNA ladder to a separate well. 1μl should be enough for detection under UV.
4)Connect the electrodes to the power supply with correct colour. Set the power supply to 120V. Check if there are bubbles on the negative electrodes.
5) Allow it to run for about 40 - 60 mins. To avoid running the band off the gel, the yellow band (position of the smallest fragments) should stay on the gel.
 
*Gel Extraction
 
1. Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
2. Weigh the gel slice in a 2 ml centrifuge tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to
1 volume of gel (100 mg ~ 100 μl).
3. Incubate at 50°C until the gel slice has completely dissolved (around 10  min). Mix by vortexing the tube every 2 mins during the incubation.
4. After the gel slice has dissolved completely, check that the color of the  mixture is yellow. If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 5-10 μl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), and mix until it turns to yellow.
5. Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix (for DNA fragments <500 bp and >4 kb).
6. Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
7. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 30 s. (The maximum volume of the column reservoir is 800 μl. For sample volumes of more than 800 μl, simply load and spin again).
8. Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same  collection tube. Collection tubes are re-used to reduce plastic waste.
9. Add 0.5 ml of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30 s toremove all traces of agarose.
10. To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column, stand for 2 mins and centrifuge for 30 s.
11. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for anadditional 30 s and air-dry for 2 mins (This step can ensure all ethanol is removed and the column is NOT over-dry)!
12. Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
 
13. To elute DNA, add 35 μl of 50 oC ddH2O to the center of the QIAquick
membrane, wait 2 mins and centrifuge the column for 2 mins at maximum speed.

Electrodes functional test
 
- Protocol
Put electrodes to 100 ml double distilled water, measure the voltage by multimeter between two electrodes until the reading becomes steady. Then, put electrodes to 100 ml, 0.4 M sodium chloride solution. Parallel connect a voltmeter and an ammeter  (both are multimeter actually) between the two electrodes to measure voltage and current. Take the readings every minute.
When the voltage reading achieve steady, replace sodium chloride solution with double distilled water. While keep taking readings every minute. Put the electrodes in fresh water again. Keep taking the readings every minute until the voltage achieve steady.Plot voltage vs. time and current vs. time. Calculate the power for every time point. Estimate the total electric work.
 
Bacterialight-couple electricity generation
 
- Protocol
The experiment was conducted within a Class 2 biosafety cabinet and under sterile condition. Before each experiment the electrodes (4 ply carbon cloth, 3x4 cm each) were rinsed twice by immersing in tap water for 1-2 minutes, then wrapped with aluminium foil and autoclaved at 121⁰C for 25 minutes. Other instruments such as multimeter were wiped thoroughly with 70% ethanol before the experiment starts. The electrodes were fixed at the wall of the beaker with maximum possible separation (~3 cm) and connected to a RIGOL DM3051 digital multimeter with unshielded cable. The background open-circuit potential was about -0.1 to +0.2 mV.
25 mL of e. coli bacterial suspension (see below) were poured into the 100mL beaker. We define the moment where pouring was completed as t=0. Potential reading was then taken every minute afterwards using automatic data logging function of the multimeter. The experiment was done at room temperature.
To minimize the impact of external lighting on the experiments, most lights in the laboratory was turned off and the front glass of the biosafety cabinet was completely blocked by a polystyrene board after the bacterial suspension has been added. This is what we define as “dark condition” (<0.5 lux). The “light condition” was achieved by illuminating the beaker with a white LED (appox. 4160 lux at the beaker). The LED was a few centimeters above and aside from the beaker.
 
Measuring voltage vs. sodium chloride concentration relation of mixing entropy electrode
 
- Protocol
To start with, 0.6M stock sodium chloride solution was prepared by dissolving 5.310g of sodium chloride (Sigma Aldrich, Lot no: 090M01531V) in a small beaker and subsequently transferred into a 100 mL volumetric flask and made up to the graduation mark using deionized water. Other concentrations of sodium chloride solutiosn were prepared by mixing proper proportions of stock solution and deionized water in a 100 mL measuring cylinder.
The sodium manganese electrode and the inert electrode, with the dimension of 3x4 cm each, were immersed in a random sequence into different concentrations of salt water, which was contained within a 100 mL beaker. The solution used each time was approximately 25 mL. Less than 1 cm of each electrode was immersed in the solution, but the entire electrode should be wet.
Three potential readings were taken after the potential reading became steady with a RIGOL DM3051 digital multimeter. This procedure is duplicated with another batch of stock solution to give 6 replicates at each concentration. It could take 30 minutes to a few hours for the potential to become steady, depending on the previous salinity that the electrode was exposed to. Sometimes the tendency for electrodes to repel or attract to each other can be observed. Thereby the electrodes must be fixed carefully to avoid undesirable short-circuit.
