In 2010 iGEM competition, Queens-Canada team submited Halorhodopsin from H. salinarum as biobricks and inserted this gene into C. elegans. However, it was not well characterized. This year, we are trying to clone halorhdopsin from N. pharaonis, which has already been successfully introduced and proved to perform complete light cycles in E. coli , to our biobrick system1. We aim to characterize the efficiency of this Halorhodopsin to be a well-documented biobrick and a useful tool in E. coli .
 
In previous iGEM projects, various light sensors have been developed, including red light sensor (UT Austin, 2004), green light sensor (Tokyo-Nokogen, 2009) and blue light sensor (University of Edinburgh, 2010). They are all light-induced fusion transcription factors that trigger gene expression under the control of specific promoters, facilitating simply on/off switch and light-coupled communication. However, our design makes Halorhodopsin not only a dynamically tunable light sensor – by coupling with chloride sensitive promoters (e.g. Pgad), but also an energy converter – by storing solar energy as osmolality potential and further converted it into electricity. Our project would provide a wilder scope of applications from signal transduction and gene regulation to energy generation.
