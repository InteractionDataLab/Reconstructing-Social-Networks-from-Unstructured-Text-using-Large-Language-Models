Radio Programmes
We have broadcast an education program on Synthetic Biology via a local radio channel. Chinese University Campus Radio (CUCR) is a public online radio ( http://www.cucr.hk/ ) that targets young people in Hong Kong.
 
In the first program, we mainly introduced Synthetic Biology, iGEM competition and our project content. We also shared some interesting experience in laboratory and members’ aspiration.

Our team members also took part in another radio program organized by CUCR to discuss about the Life Sciences program in CUHK. They also discussed about the iGEM competition and introduced Synthetic Biology and biosafety to the general public.
