How Our System Works
All of the parts that we created this summer are designed to be fusion proteins with Aga2, a yeast protein involved in mating. Aga2 disulfide bonds with Aga1, a membrane embedded protein, such that anything fused to Aga2 is displayed on the surface of the cell.
Interaction of Aga1 with Aga2-fused protein of interest leads to Yeast Cell Surface Display
By displaying a protein that would have strong interactions with itself (or another protein), we wanted to be able to control whether or not two cells would adhere or interact with one another. An example of how two proteins would lead to cell-cell interactions is shown below:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts
Cadherin Parts Registry - Extracellular Domain of E-Cadherin BBa_K644000: when expressed on the surface of yeast cells, the extracellular domain of E-cadherin caused the yeast cells to stick together and form large clumps, visible by microscopy. The addition of calcium to the media caused larger clumps to form and these could be disrupted with the addition of EDTA.
Hwp1 Parts Registry - Hwp1 BBa_K644001: when expressed on the surface of yeast, Hwp1 caused the cells to stick together in small biofilm0like formations similar to those made by C. albicans
Data For Pre-Existing Parts
Experience - Mgfp-5 - Mussel Foot Protein Mgfp-5 BBa_K197018 (Berkeley iGEM 2009): when expressed on the surface of yeast cells, mgfp5 caused the cells to stick together and form small clumps.
