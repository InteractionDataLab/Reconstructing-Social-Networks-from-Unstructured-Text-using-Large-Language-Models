Light-induced systems
The OmpR phosphorylation is expressed through the following expressions adapted from Srividhya and Krishnaswamy, (2006), reference E:
IMAGEN
OmpR-P dephosphorylation rate (from Qin, L, et al., 2001, reference F): 17 min when red light is present / 56 min when far-red light is present.
Quorum Sensing
For simplicity just the parameters of the LasI/LasR quorum sensing system are shown, because they are supposed to be equivalent according to the used general Quorum Sensing model.

Degradation rates
Following the recommendations of team Peking 2009, we set all mRNAs half-lives to 4.4 min and, supposing that all regulatory and reporter gene would have an LVG tag attached, all protein half-lives were set to 40 min, with the exception of phosphorylated OmpR, whose case is exposed on the last sections.
Considering a cell division rate of 30 min, then, the degradation rates for mRNA are: 1/4.4 + 1/30 min, and the protein degradation rates are: 1/40 + 1/30 min.
