Welcome to iGEM-UANL Wiki Page
HuBac's SCIENCE
Have you ever met smart bacteria? How about light responsive bacteria? Have you ever wondered how living things process information?
Well, perhaps this community will surprise you. Not only it can see light, but it can interpret it. There is no trick, no magic, only pure synthetic biology.
If you think this is an interesting concept, why not reading a bit more? Meet HuBac , our S.C.I.E.N.C.E. project for this iGEM 2011.
About us
iGEM-UANL is the representative team from Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo León, at Monterrey, México. This team is composed of ten students who spent their summer in the lab, having fun with transformations, constructions and plasmidic DNA extractions. This wiki is all about the work we made. Please be welcome to explore this site. (Read more about us here )
