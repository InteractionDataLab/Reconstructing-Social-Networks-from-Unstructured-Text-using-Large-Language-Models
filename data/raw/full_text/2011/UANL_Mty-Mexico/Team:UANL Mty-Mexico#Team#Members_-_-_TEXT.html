Jeffrey J. Tabor, Ph. D.
Jeff Tabor builds synthetic genetic control systems to engineer complex biological behaviors such as pattern formation and social interactions.
His projects at Rice University include engineering cellular sensors that respond to unnatural inputs such as light, building genetic circuits and signal transduction cascades to process sensory information, combining sensors and circuits to rewire metabolic pathways, engineering new modes of cell-cell communication, and combining all of these technologies to program synthetic social interactions and pattern formation. The research builds upon his work as a postdoctoral fellow in Christopher Voigt's laboratory at University of California, San Francisco where he programmed bacterial communities to function as a light responsive photographic film and work as a parallel computer to perform the image-processing task of edge detection.
The research, which was supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) from the National Institutes of Health, demonstrated that complex multicellular behaviors can be engineered by the stepwise assembly of well-characterized genetic modules.
Diana Resendez-Pérez, Ph. D.
Diana Resendez-Pérez. Professor of Developmental Biology and Genetics in the Department of Cell Biology and Genetics at the University of Nuevo Leon in México. In addition of scientific research at UANL, she is doing teaching both in Bachelor and Graduate School basically on Genetics, Developmental Biology and Molecular Biology. Her research focuses in using Drosophila melanogaster and genomic approaches to understand biological processes. Her lab is mainly focus on the following areas: Genetic regulation of Antennapedia function during development of D. melanogaster, Homeotic regulation using microRNAs in Drosophila, Differential expression of HOX genes in Breast, Ovarian and Cervical Cancer and Molecular Genotyping of Agaves using ITSs nucleotide sequences. Professor Resendez was awarded with the UANL prize for basic research in 1991 and the Honorific mention "Summa Cum Laude" in her Ph.D. dissertation two years later.
