Jeffrey J. Tabor, Ph. D.</SPAN><DIV class="left-text" style="width:440px"><P><B>Jeff Tabor</B> builds synthetic genetic control systems to engineer complex biological behaviors such as pattern formation and social interactions.
His projects at Rice University include engineering cellular sensors that respond to unnatural inputs such as light, building genetic circuits and signal transduction cascades to process sensory information, combining sensors and circuits to rewire metabolic pathways, engineering new modes of cell-cell communication, and combining all of these technologies to program synthetic social interactions and pattern formation. The research builds upon his work as a postdoctoral fellow in Christopher Voigt's laboratory at University of California, San Francisco where he programmed bacterial communities to function as a light responsive photographic film and work as a parallel computer to perform the image-processing task of edge detection. The research, which was supported by a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) from the National Institutes of Health, demonstrated that complex multicellular behaviors can be engineered by the stepwise assembly of well-characterized genetic modules.</P></DIV><SPAN class="subtitle">
