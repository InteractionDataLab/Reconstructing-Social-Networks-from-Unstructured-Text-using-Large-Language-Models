E. coli MxRed. Derived from Dr. Jeff Tabor JT2 E. coli strain, this part is a built-in red-light induction system in E. coli made through chromosome insertion. Avoiding the need of any extra-chromosomal DNA when light-inducing gene expression offering several advantages to the researcher.
It is proposed as a photo-chassis that could make useful tools in this field of light induction.
Integration include the genes pcyA, ho1, Cph8 and a Mnt working as follows: Genes ho1 and pcyA are responsible for the chromophore synthesis. Cph8 codes for the chimaeric red-light receptor. These three genes are constitutively expressed. Mnt repressor is expressed from pOmpC promoter, and the red light stops its induction. It is therefore used as a NOT-gate to regulate expression from pMnt.

Cph8 CDS. The red light-sensing protein Cph8 is expressed in the phosphorylated ground state. It is switched to the unphosphorylated state by 650-nm light and back to the phosphorylated state by 705-nm light. When phosphorylated, Cph8 passes a phosphoryl group to OmpR, which then binds to and activates transcription from PompC. Because it is inactivated by red light, Cph8 can be considered a logical (NOT red) sensor. A genetic inverter or logical NOT gate is used to invert the response of the (NOT red) sensor to that of a red light sensor.
 
BBa_K566026
Cph8 gene for red-photoreceptor (constitutive expression). Cassette for constitutive expression of Cph8, originally constructed by Dr. Jeff Tabor.
This gene codifies for the red light-sensing protein Cph8, which is expressed in the phosphorylated ground state. It is switched to the unphosphorylated state by 650-nm light and back to the phosphorylated state by 705-nm light. When phosphorylated, Cph8 passes a phosphoryl group to OmpR, which then binds to and activates transcription from PompC. Because it is inactivated by red light, Cph8 can be considered a logical (NOT red) sensor. A genetic inverter or logical NOT gate is used to invert the response of the (NOT red) sensor to that of a red light sensor.

CcaS. Ccas is a member of cyanobacteriochrome family of proteins. Phycocyanobillin (PCB) binds at a conserved cysteine domain of CcaS and activates signaling activity. CcaS, along with its response regulator CcaR, activates transcription of promoter pCpcG2. Activation shows max response with 535 nm wavelength green light and with 672 nm wavelength red light. When absorbing green light, CcaS autophosphorylates and then carries out phosphotransfer to CcaR. Phosphorylated CcaR (CcaR*) acts as a transcription factor for pCpcG2. This process can be reverted with absorption of red light.

Avoiding the need of any extra-chromosomal DNA when light-inducing gene expression offering several advantages to the researcher.  It is proposed as a photo-chassis that could make useful tools in this field of light induction.  Integration was performed for the genes pcyA, ho1, Cph8 and a Mnt working as follows: Genes ho1 and pcyA are responsible for the chromophore synthesis.

BBa_K566042
Second State for Biphasic switch. Biphasic switch proof concept. Composite part of BBa_K566015 , BBa_K145015 , BBa_B0014 and BBa_K566039 . The biphasic switch may be used to control both expression and repression of pRM through a single input, which must control cI protein concentration. Furthermore, if repressor cI434 is placed under pRM's control along with the gene of interest, this switch may be coupled with the modified promoter pRM434 BBa_I12006 , which is stimulated by cI but repressed by cI434; hence resulting in a two-state switch controlled through a single input. The expected behavior will be the following: 1) at low concentrations of cI, both promoters will be activated. However, because of cI434 repressing pRM434, only pRM will stay ON eventually leading to the first state. 2) At high concentrations of cI, pRM -and consequently cI434- will be turned OFF, allowing pRM434 to be activated by cI and leading to a second state. pRM promoter from Phage 434 (not to confuse with pRM434 mentioned above) seems to exhibit the same biphasic behavior. This part is intended to prove the behavior shown in figure 1, using fluorescent proteins as reporter genes. It is coupled with the part K566040 , which contains the pRM434 promoter. GFP -transcribed from pRM- represents the first state, while YFP -transcribed from pRM434- represents the second state.
