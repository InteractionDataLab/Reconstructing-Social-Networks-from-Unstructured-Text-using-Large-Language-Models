Logo
iGEM-UANL2011 Official Logo. The logo represents a bacterial community that is capable of interpreting a simple light code. Light stimuli is filtrated through 532nm (green) and 650nm (red) bandpass filters, represented by the green and red glasses. Five fluorescent proteins used as reporter genes in our project are represented by the five colored gear.The logo was made and designed by Diego Cuerda.
iGEM-UANL2011 Circuit Simbol. The Circuit Symbol represents essentially the idea of ​​our project in general: the construction of a genomic circuit that works using only two inputs —the two different wavelength lights—, and gives as a response five different fluorescent proteins that are represented as the five outputs.
