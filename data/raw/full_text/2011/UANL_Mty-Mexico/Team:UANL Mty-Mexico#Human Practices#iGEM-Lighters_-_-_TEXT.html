About iGEM Lighters!
As a social focus of our project, we did an effort to create a community of all the iGEM teams working with light induction systems.
In order to make communication and cooperation between teams easier, we created a Facebook group. It was called "iGEM Lighters" , and by this media we invited all the "light-teams" to join us.
The contacted teams that became part of the "iGEM Lighters" community were: Freiburg , Uppsala , Cornell , McGill and Uppen , with whom contact was maintained during the summer.
We believe this was a great way of collaboration, as well as a good example to others teams that may inspire them to create networks with common objectives. The same way, this was an opportunity for us to be known by researchers that could help us out with some of our doubts and problems; such as Dr. Jeff Tabor (well known by most of you, pioneer on this matters), who was aware there were several teams working with light induction and had always been pleased to help us.
