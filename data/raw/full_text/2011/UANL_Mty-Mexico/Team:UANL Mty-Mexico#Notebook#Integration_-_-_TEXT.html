Integration Protocol
1. Electrocompetent cells preparation
This procedure is described in the protocols section. We started from the JT2 strain, provided by Dr. Jeff Tabor, as its genotype has already been modified to be properly light-induced.
2. Transformation with pTKRed
Take one aliquot of the electrocompetent cells and add 500 ug of pTKRED 
Incubate for one minute in ice
Place the aliquot on the electroporator and  adjust the device at 2.5 kV, 25 mF and 200 Ohms
Give the pulse
Remove the cells of the electroporator device and add 1 mL of SOC medium
Incubate for 1 hour
Growing cells (500 μL) in LB agar plates supplemented with tetracycline (5 μg/mL) and incubate overnight at 30 oC.
Inoculate one colony in 5 mL of LB medium with tetracycline, extract the plasmid DNA (Miniprep) and characterize using EcoRV.
3. Landing pad integration
Using pTKS/CS as a PCR template, amplify landing pad fragments using the landing pad regions as standardize priming sites, following the next conditions:
95 oC for 30s
98 oC for 35 cycles of 15s
55 oC for 15s
72 oC for 30s
The resulting PCR reaction should be digested with 1 mL DpnI per 50 mL PCR 2 hours at 37 oC
Using the above protocol, generate electrocompetent  TKRED  cells
Take one aliquot of the electrocompetent TKRED cells and add 100 μg of amplified landing pad fragment 
Incubate for one minute in ice
Place the aliquot on the electroporator and  adjust the device at 2.5 kV, 25 mF and 200 Ohms
Give the pulse
Remove the cells of the electroporator device and add 1 mL of SOC medium
Incubate for 1 hour
Growing cells (500 μL) in LB agar plates supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/mL), spectinomycin (100 μg/mL) y glucose 0.5%
The other 500 μL of the electroporated should be allow to sit overnight and grown in LB the next day.
Potential integrants were picked onto LB plates supplemented with 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol to screen against colonies which had been transformed with undigested pTKS/CS plasmid.
The colonies grown must have integrated the landing pad fragment
4. Fragment Insertion
Inoculated individual colonies electroporated with the pTKIP plasmid (following the protocol said before) in 5 mL of M9 minimal medium with IPTG 2 mM and L-arabinose  0.2 % w/v.
The M9 minimal medium prepared according to the following specifications:
To make M9 Salts aliquot 800ml H2O and add:
64g Na2HPO4-7H2O
15g KH2PO4
2.5g NaCl
5.0g NH4Cl
Stir until dissolved
Adjust to 1000ml with distilled H2O
Sterilize by autoclaving
Measure ~420 ml of distilled H2O (sterile)
Add 500 ml of M9 salts (While it’s still hot)
Add 20 ml of 0.1M MgSO4 (sterile)
Add 10 ml of 40% glycerol (or other carbon source)
Add 200 μl of 0.5M CaCl2 (sterile)
Adjust to 1000ml with distilled H2O
Incubate for 1 hour at 37  °C in a Shaking Water Bath
Add 100 μg/mL of spectiomycin
Incubate for 4 hours at 30 oC in a Shaking Water Bath
Add 100 μg/mL of hygromicin and incubate overnight
Dilute the sample to 105 and plated 500 ml on LB plates with hygromycin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 37 ° C overnight
Potential integrants are picked and screened on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 10 μg/ml tetracycline to verify the loss of the landing pad and donor plasmid.
