WetLab: Circuit construction
Construction Plans
Construction of whole circuits for this project was planed as detailed in the next three figures. Briefly, it consisted on joining CDS to RBS and terminator in the first stage, this for constructing almost complete genes. This constructions would allow combination of multiple joint to different promoters that would be in the next stage, which includes gene construction. For the last stage, genes would be combine in different orders to make complete circuits.
Construction of circuit - Stage 1 Construction of circuit - Stage 2 Construction of circuit - Stage 3
Note: Original idea for circuit was planed to be regulated through chemical inputs or light induction systems. That is why multiple promoters were added.
For construction of this circuit, different approaches were planed. One of them consisted on joining three parts at a time, reducing number of cloning steps as shown previously.
Other methodologies were followed, as mention in the section Photocassette Construction , using PCR for cloning.
Both methodologies were performed while doing classic BioBrick Assembly.
