iGEM Lighters Community
iGEM Lighters logo
As a social focus of our project, we are making an effort to create a community of all the iGEM teams working with light induction systems. To date, we have established contact with teams from Rutgers, Minnesota and Freigburg. We hope this to keep growing.
In order to make communication and  cooperation between teams easier, we created a Facebook group. It was called iGEM Lighters, and by this media we invite all the "light-teams" to join us. Here is the link: http://www.facebook.com/groups/164426413628518 We really hope you to be a part of it.
We believe this could be a great way of collaboration, as well as a good example to others teams that may inspire them to create networks with common objectives. The same way, this can be an opportunity for us to be known by researchers that could help us out with some of our doubts and problems; such as Dr. Jeff Tabor (well known by most of you, pioneer on this matters), who is already aware there are several teams working with light induction and has always been pleased to help us.
