We believe synthetic biology must be diffused not just among biologists but among all the scientific community. That is why we decided to create the Bio! blog , which is intended to give the student and everyone interested an insight into synthetic biology and biotechnology. However, we realize not everyone is familiar or even interested in those areas. Of course we cannot blame them, we hardly doubt most of us understand even a bit about quantum physics for example ( G-particle? ). That is why, before introducing the subject to the public, we want to know what they know and how they feel about the topic; we got some interesting results from our survey .
Now, among synthetic biologists, we think cooperation is a fundamental aspect through which the nascent science will grow. We have already seen design, simulation and construction of amazing biological devices. We approach the time where imagination itself is the greatest limit for biological constructions. Our iGEM Lighters community is an effort to create a small community of people working with light-induction, on the other hand it is a big inspiration for people to do the same. Small communities  can create big nets, to which we can all contribute and benefit  from.
