General Assembly
Day 1
Plasmid extraction through miniprep
Insert PCR
Restriction digest
Ligation
Transformation
Plate
Incubate overnight
Day 2
Colony PCR
Run gel
If gel yields positive results, culture
Incubate in shaker overnight
Day 3
Extract modified plasmid through miniprep
Send plasmid to sequencing center
Examine sequencing results
If sequencing results are positive, make freezer stock
If sequencing results are negative, start again from insert PCR
Restriction Digest
Based on BioBrick Assembly Manual
Insert
38μl water
5μl buffer
5μl Purified PCR product
1μl BSA
1μl each enzyme (either EcoRI and SpeI or XbaI and PstI)
0.5μl DpnI
Put in 37°C water bath for 1-2 hours
Heat kill for 20 mins in 80°C bath
Vector
32μl water
10μl miniprep
5μl buffer
1μl BSA
1μl each enzyme (either EcoRI and XbaI or SpeI and PstI)
Put in 37°C water bath for 1-2 hours
Add 6μl Antarctic Phosphatase Buffer and 1μl AP
Incubate for another hour at 37°C*Heat kill for 20 mins in 80°C bath
Test Digest
4.5μl water
10μl miniprep
2μl buffer
2μl 10 X BSA
0.75μl each enzyme (either EcoRI and XbaI or SpeI and PstI)
Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
No 80°C heat kill necessary
PCR
Insert Amplification
42μl water
5μl buffer
1μl DNTPs
1μl Forward Primer
1μl Reverse Primer
0.5μl VENT polymerase
0.5μl template DNA (plasmid from miniprep or registry)
     Run thirty cycles of the "Taq Vent PCR" program but adjust the extention time to fit your part. Extention time is based on the size of ...your part.  Vent polymerase proceeds at 1kb/min. Once you know  your part size, add 300bp and this will determine your extention time. The minimum extention time is 45 seconds.  It's also good to give  a little extra extention time.
     Examples: part is 200 bp, extention time of 45 seconds; part length of 700bp, extention time of 1min:10secs, part length of 1.6kb, extention time of 2min.
For colony PCR
42μl water
5μl buffer
1μl DNTPs
1μl Forward Primer
1μl Reverse Primer
1μl TAQ polymerase
Colony stab (template DNA)
     To get template DNA just stab a colony with a pipette tip and then pipette up and down in the PCR mix.  Run the "Colony PCR" program, and adjust your extention time as described above.
Assembly via PCR
1μl Forward Primer
1μl Reverse Primer
1μl DNTPs
1μl TAQ polymerase
1μl Thermopol buffer
41μl dH2O
Ligation
12μl water
2μl T4 Buffer
3μl Vector Digest
3μl Insert Digest
1μl T4 Ligase (add this last)
Incubate for 10 min at room temp
Heat kill for 10 mins at 70-80°C
Note: Before you start be sure to quick centrifuge the digests to get any condensation to the bottom of the tube; otherwise you are concentrating things that shouldn't be concentrated (i.e. salts) and this will have a negative effect on transformation efficiency.
Transformation/Plating
Note: This is a procedure for performing # transformations
Prepare #ml of SOC medium by adding MgCl2 and Glucose to SOB medium.  Add 5μl MgCl2 solution and 10μl Glucose solution per ml of SOB.
Distribute 900ul of SOC into # clean tubes  (these are the recovery tubes, label them).
Fill ice bucket with ice and water
Add # cuvettes to the float and put it in ice.  No ice water should EVER enter the cuvette.
Remove # tubes of competent cells from the -80°C freezer and place in the ice float. Do everything you can to keep these cells cold.
Set electroporator to 1500 volts.
Important: Quickly centrifuge the ligations to remove any condensation.
Add 5ul of ligation to each tube of competent cells.
Quickly transfer the cell/ligation mix to the cuvette, dry, and electroporate.
Quickly remove the cells with a pipette, and place them in the correct recovery tube.
Once all cells are transformed, place the recovery tubes in the 37°C bath for 1-2 hours.
Plate 100μl of this recovery solution on the correct selective agar plate.
Prepare Culture
5 ml SOB medium
5 μl antiobiotic
colony stab (pipette up and down)
Prepare Freezer Stock
Add 300 μl overnight culture to 2 separate microcentrifuge tubes. LABEL THEM!
Add 300 μl of 40% glycerol to each tube.
Store one copy of each part in both -20° and -80° freezers.
