<H1> The Video </H1><P>
This year, for the human practices portion of the iGEM competition, the Penn State team developed a
video that explains synthetic biology in an understandable way for any general audience. This video is
titled “(Re)designing Life” and addresses many topics surrounding the implementation and execution of
synthetic biology. These topics include misconceptions generated by misinformation from the general
public, the techniques used to perform synthetic biology, ethical issues surrounding genetic engineering
research and the future applications of synthetic biology. Through this video, the Penn State team
aimed to bridge the gap from the technical jargon used by today’s scientists and the general public
understands of common biology. As a result, the misconceptions surrounding these technologies will
be eliminated, opening a new relationship between synthetic biologists and the population they wish to
improve through research. </P><H2>Why This Video is Unique </H2><P>
While previous teams have made synthetic biology informational videos for their human practices
project, this video differs not in content, but in audience. Most of the previous videos and workshops
submitted to iGEM have been directed towards elementary and secondary schools, as well as
college students. The Penn State team developed their video with the elderly in mind as the primary
audience. The residents of Foxdale Village, a retirement community in State College, PA, were given
the opportunity to view the video submitted by the Penn State team. The age range of these residents
spanned about 40 years, from 65-104, a demographic previously ignored by the iGEM competition.
From this viewing and a short discussion following the video, the residents were able to gain a better
understanding of genetically modified organisms and their relation to synthetic biology.
</P><H2>Why the elderly?</H2><P>
In addition to their role as an untapped demographic, the elderly provide an open audience available
to give feedback and opinions regarding the synthetic biology video. While the elderly population will
have difficulty adding to the ever expanding technology that allows genetic engineering and synthetic
biology, this demographic can still have a lasting impact on the scope of the scientific world. The elderly
remain active in the political landscape through voting. According to the report summarizing the 2008
presidential election voting patterns, about 20% of all voters were above the age of 65, while only 10%
were between 18-24. The latter age group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices
projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now…

GMOs are defined as any organism whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered through human
intervention. </P><DIV class="printfooter">
