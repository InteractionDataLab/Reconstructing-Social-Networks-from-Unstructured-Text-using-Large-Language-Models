Project
Optogenetics is the coupling of light activation with microbiology techniques. Genetically engineered cells are targeted by light, enabling the control of specific physiological processes in the system. Optogenetics uses an external light source to activate these genetically modified cells. This year, our iGEM project wishes to replace this light source with an additional cell population, thus creating a cell to cell optogenetic signaling system. We are using a synthetic biology approach to optogenetics in order to create a light-based cell signaling system. This marriage of synthetic biology and optogenetics would allow for specific control and regulation of engineered synthetic circuits to perform robust functions using less invasive light application techniques. Our synthetic system contains two units: the sender cells and the receiver cells. We are using a bioluminescent protein to signal to the receiver cell. We are trying various bioluminescent signals isolated from different sources including marine species and BioBricks. Our receiver cell is engineered to be excited by this signal to perform an output. If successful, this optogenetic cell to cell signaling system has enormous biomedical applications such as transdermal dosing of insulin for diabetic patients. This light-induced signaling system could possibly be used to cross biological barriers, such as the gastrointestinal barrier. It would also allow for more mechanisms of vivo signaling.
