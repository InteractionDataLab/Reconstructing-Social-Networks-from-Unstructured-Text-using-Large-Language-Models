Project Status
From week 15 we finished up all remaining ligation work and tested all of our constructs within the worm.  This included chemotactic assays to asses the GCPR’s and fluorescent microscopy to asses the fluorescent constructions. We also worked hard on finishing our wiki, competition poster and presentation.
