Glycerol Stock
Storage and Labelling
- Store the glycerol stock product in the -80°C freezer
- Label the product tube as “EC (GL)” and in accordance with the standard labelling format, as outlined at the front of your lab book and on Google Docs
Materials
- Overnight bacterial cell culture
- Cryogenic screw-cap vials
- 30% glycerol in H2O
Procedure
1. Pipette 750μL 30% glycerol into cryogenic vials. (Note: withdraw very slowly as glycerol is very viscous)
2. Add 750μL of overnight culture to each vial.
3. Gently vortex the cryogenic vial to ensure the culture and glycerol is well-mixed.
4. Label each vial in accordance with labeling convention.
5. Store in a freeze box in -80⁰C freezer.
