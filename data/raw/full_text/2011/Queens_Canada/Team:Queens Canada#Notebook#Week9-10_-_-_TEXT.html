Project Status
In week 9, having acquired a good deal of genes through PCR, we began the site-directed mutagenesis process. This took a good deal of time, since we had a lot of genes with a lot of mutations. During this period we also experimented with oligo-directed mutagenesis, which was much more effective but also very, very costly.  At the end of week 10 we had completed about half of the necessary mutations. Allister came back at some point and we rejoiced.
