Mission Statement
The objective of the Queen’s Genetically Engineered Machine (QGEM) Team is to provide a learning opportunity to a team of Queen’s students by supporting them to allow them to compete at the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM).
The team will develop their genetic engineering project, complete it over the course of the summer and then prepare for the iGEM competition in the fall.
Completing an iGEM project will give the students experience in applying engineering and biological principles to solve real‐world problems, while allowing them to gain a broader knowledge base and learn to work in an interdisciplinary team environment.
