Project Status
Weeks 5 and 6 were all about primer design.  We had heard some scary stories about teams designing primers wrong so we were rigorous in ensuring we ordered ours correctly. This included familiarizing ourselves with the principles of primer formatting, designing the regular and site directed mutagenesis primers and triple checking them to ensure to they were made correctly.
In these weeks we also worked on developing side projects such as a kill switch for the worm, a reporter system to detect environmental contaminants and a preliminary biodegradation pathway. We also continued work on sponsorship and the wiki.
