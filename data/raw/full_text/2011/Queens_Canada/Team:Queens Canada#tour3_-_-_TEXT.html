Safety in the Lab
As any research lab's top priority, synthetic biology safety was taken very seriously this summer by our lab. To keep our team out of harm's way in the wet lab, we started the summer off by researching and developing a dedicated safety proposal along with a Frequently-Asked-Questions (FAQs) page .
New Directions: Bioterrorism
The risk of potential misuse of biobrick parts has been a key component of iGEM human practices over the years. Our team this year decided to not only acknowledge the potential, but investigate this possibility, uncover the implications, and examine required responses. Our report on bioterrorism can be found here .
