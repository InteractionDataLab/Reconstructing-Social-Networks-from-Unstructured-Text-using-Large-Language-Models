Synthetic Biology & iGEM
The iGEM Competition was started in 2004 at MIT as a way to get students actively involved in the exciting field of synthetic biology. More than a hundred teams from around the world enter each year, making it one of the world's largest undergraduate conferences.
The synthetic biology discipline incorporates elements of engineering and biological principals to solve real-world problems.
