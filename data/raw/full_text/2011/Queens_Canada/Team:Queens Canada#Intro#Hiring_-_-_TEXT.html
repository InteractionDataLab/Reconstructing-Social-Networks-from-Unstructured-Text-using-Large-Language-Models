What is QGEM?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) team at Queen's University is called QGEM, composed of a group of undergraduate students from Kingston, Canada.
Are you looking for a sumer job? If you’re interested in a new field called synthetic biology, then the Queen’s Genetic Engineered Machine Team (QGEM) is looking for you! QGEM combines engineering principles with biology to design a system that is capable of performing a programmed function, with applications ranging from medicine to industry.
Learn more about: iGEM , QGEM's 2011 Project , or synthetic biology .
Winter Info Night Session
Come out to the QGEM 2012 Info Session, held on Monday, January 23, from 7:00-0:00PM in Stirling C. Here, past members of QGEM will give a presentation outlining synthetic biology, iGEM and the opportunities presented by QGEM.

Useful Documents
The following is a collection of documents that offer some background information on the field of synthetic biology and iGEM. These may be of interest to you if you are curious about iGEM or synthetic biology (explore 2011 Wiki for more information), or are considering applying to work on the QGEM team.
BioBrick Standard
The entire iGEM experience hinges on students having the ability to perform genetic modification of cells as easily and expediently as possible.  To make this possible, the BioBrick Standard system was devised by the founders of iGEM, and all teams adhere to this system.  This document outlines the system and how it works.
