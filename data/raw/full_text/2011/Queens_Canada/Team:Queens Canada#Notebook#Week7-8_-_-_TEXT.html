Project Status
In weeks 6 and 7 we began work in the lab.  We began by familiarizing ourselves with basic techniques in synthetic biology such as gel electrophoresis and PCR. We had a frustrating week or so troubleshooting our PCR reactions but resolved it near the end of week 7.
As usual, we continued with sponsorship and the wiki.  Week 7 also saw the dawn of Fancy Fridays, a now great QGEM tradition.
