Project Status
We continued the assembly of our genes and in weeks 13 and 14 and had much better results than in the previous weeks. Concurrently, we worked to develop and test the chemotactic assay technique used to asses our GCPR constructs.  We also continued to explore our novel ligation method and fluorescent constructs within the worm, which were originally part of our idea for the reporter system.
