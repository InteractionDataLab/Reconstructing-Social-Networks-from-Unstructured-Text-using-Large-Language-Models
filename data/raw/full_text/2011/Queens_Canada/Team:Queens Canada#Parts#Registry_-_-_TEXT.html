GPCR Constructs & Other Modular Parts
In approaching our chemotaxis project, several G-protein coupled receptors were cultivated from multiple mammalian sources.
BBa_K631005- NPY1R_Mus
The coding sequence for the NPY1R protein. This is a GPCR from Mus musculus.
BBa_K631006 - NPY1R_Rat
The coding sequence for the NPY1R protein from Rattus norvegius. This is also a GPCR .
BBa_K631007 - ADBR2
The coding sequence for ADBR2, a mouse GPCR that binds phenol (albuteroll). Length: 1257
BBa_K631009 - OX1R
Coding sequence for OX1R, a mouse GPCR that binds 4-cholorobenzoic acid.
BBa_K631010 - MARM1
Coding sequence for MARM1, a rat receptor that binds phenol (hydroquinone).
BBa_K631039 - nahD
The coding sequence for the nahD protein, from pseudomonas peutida, capable of degrading napthalene. Expressing this in our worm may give it the ability to degrade naphthalene.

Regulatory Constructs for C. elegans
BBa_K631035 - Str2
A promoter for AWC neurons, normally used for a 7-transmembrane olfactory receptor. We can use this as a promoter to integrate non-native GPCRs into the AWC neuron membrane.
BBa_K631001 - ODR-7
A promoter for a 7-transmembrane olfactory receptor in AWA olfactory neurons. This can be used for integrating non-native GPCRs. Length: 1503
BBa_K631002 - let-858
A promoter for a protein essential for the development of the worm. We used this in one of our composite parts to express fluorescence in the worm.
BBa_K631003 - GPC-1
A promoter for one of the gamma sub-units of the GPCR binding proteins. We used this for our fluorescence as well. Length: 2000
BBa_K631004 - GCY7
A promoter for a membrane guanylyl cyclase protein. This can be used for a non-native receptor or fluorescence reporter.

Composite Constructs
BBa_K631031 - ODR7:OX1R:UNC-54
A composite part designed to place the non-native OX1R into the neurons of the worm using the ODR-7 promoter for the ability to detect cholorobenzoic acid.
BBa_K631032 - ODR7:ADBR2:UNC-54
A composite part designed to place the non-native ADBR2 into the neurons of the worm using the ODR-7 promoter for the ability to detect phenol (albuteroll). Length: 3666
BBa_K631033 - GCY7:ADBR2:UNC-54
Another composite part with ADBR2, under the GCY7 promoter.
BBa_K631037 - GPC-1:eCFP:UNC-54
This is a composite part for our reporter system using cyano-fluorescent protein under the GPC-1 promoter. Length: 3787
BBa_K631034 - let858:RFP:UNC-54
This is a composite part for our reporter system using red fluorescent protein under the let858 promoter.
BBa_K631038 - GCY-7:eCFP:UNC-54
This is a composite part for our reporter system using cyano-fluorescent protein under the GCY-7 promoter.
BBa_K631036 - eCFP:UNC-54
Eukaryotic cyano-fluorescent protein for the reporter system in our worm. Length: 1629.
