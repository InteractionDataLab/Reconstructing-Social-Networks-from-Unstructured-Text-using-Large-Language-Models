Undergraduate Members
Adrian McNeely
Adrian is a biochemist. He enjoys long walks on the beach, red wine, and successful PCRs.
Tony He
Tony is a life scientist, who performs "magic tricks" to turn things on paper into living things. He enjoys the outdoors and various sports, and wishes to eventually become the magician of life and health.
Stephanie Zhou
Stephanie Zhou's interest in Synthetic Biology began in 2008 with a research project on using GM models in cancer genetics. Stephanie will be majoring in Life Sciences and, inspired by the work of Dr. David Larson (UCSF), she hopes to ultimately study radiation oncology.
Olivia Margie
Olivia is a life scientist by day and breakdancer by night.  As such she works by keeping the team fresh, in perspective and style
Alex Campbell
Alex is an engineering chemist/biochemist who enjoys skiing, squash and cottaging. He recently acquired superpowers after being bitten by a radioactive nematode.
Allister Smith
Allister is a biochemical engineer. Mr. Smith enjoys mountain biking, the continuous shooting mode on his camera and is responsible for all spelling mistakes on the Wiki.
David Dai
David is a life scientist. He spent his time this summer between Faculty Advisor meetings, excursions in Peru and conducting hours of pre-lab research.
Sophie Gong
Sophie is a life scientist. She enjoys kayaking, photography, and classical music. She acts as the team strongwoman, standing up to the most gruesome grad student or nefarious nematode.
Kevin Chen
Kevin is a biochemist. Between unicycling, breakdancing and juggling, Kevin is the master of fast digests and gel electrophoresis.
Kristina Collavino
Kristina is a biochemical engineer. When not heat shocking, she can be found playing soccer, listening to the Backstreet Boys and attending Friday afternoon 'Rituals'.
Eni Rukaj
Eni is a biomedical scientist.  She enjoys primer design, afternoon Iced Capps from Timmies, and the thrilling feeling of being in the lab.
Faisal Bakhteyar
Faisal is a biochemical engineer. Between synthetic biology, spending three months as a volunteer in Botswana and taking pictures, Faisal always has time to cheer on his favourite FC, Barcelona.

Mission Statement
The objective of the Queen’s Genetically Engineered Machine (QGEM) Team is to provide a learning opportunity to a team of Queen’s students by supporting them to allow them to compete at the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM).
The team will develop their genetic engineering project, complete it over the course of the summer and then prepare for the iGEM competition in the fall.
Completing an iGEM project will give the students experience in applying engineering and biological principles to solve real‐world problems, while allowing them to gain a broader knowledge base and learn to work in an interdisciplinary team environment.
