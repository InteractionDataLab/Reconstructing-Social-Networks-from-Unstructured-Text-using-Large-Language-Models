The potential carcinogen ethidium bromide was used in our gel electrophoresis experiments. We followed our labs standard protocols for dealing with the substance,  which includes the use of protective material and steps to minimize the use of ethidium bromide.  As well,  the carcinogen naphthalene was used in our chemotaxis assays. Care was taken to handle all chemicals in a well-ventilated area, using appropriate safety attire.

In any transgenic organism, a potential risk could be posed to human and ecosystem health due to  their novel genetics conferring an evolutionary advantage over wild type organisms. Given this, this project is designed to minimize the possibility that such an event could occur. <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I> is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Furthermore, the extrachromosomal assay used in the microinjection process greatly weakens the constitution of transgenetic <I>C.elegans</I>.
Therefore, if it did escape in the wild, it would be even less likely to be pathogenic to humans than wild type, and would probably be outcompeted by wild type <I>C.elegans</I> in all environments.
</REGULARTEXT></P><P><H3GREEN1>c. Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?</H3GREEN1><REGULARTEXT>
Transgenic <I>C.elegans</I> would pose a minimal risk to the environment for reasons similar to why they would pose a minimal risk to humans. The extrachomosomal assay previously mentioned makes transgenic <I>C.elegans</I> less robust than wild type worms in most situations. The exception for this would be in an environment heavily contaminated by toxic hydrocarbons. Our transgenic worms would be better at using the hydrocarbons as an energy source. Upon the completion of the bioremediation process  however, the advantage possessed by the transgenic worms would disappear and they would once again be out competed by wild type worms.  Therefore it is unlikely that the transgenic worms would be able to establish any stable ecological niche. Another concern is that transgenic <I>C. elegans</I> could mate with wild type worms to produce hybrid offspring. While it is possible these genes could propagate through the genetic matrix in this way, they confer an advantage only in the most limited and transient of circumstances. Therefore it is highly unlikely that our constructs would contaminate the <I>C. elegans</I> gene pool with any degree of substance or efficiency. 
</REGULARTEXT></P><P><H3GREEN1>d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?</H3GREEN1><REGULARTEXT><I>C. elegans</I> is a low risk organism for malicious genetic manipulation for a variety of reasons. First, <I>C. elegans </I> is significantly more difficult to work with than a standard <I>E. coli </I> chassis. While <I>E. coli</I> can be engineered with a simple heat shock procedure, <I>C. elegans </I> requires expensive micro-injection equipment and highly trained injectors.  Furthermore, <I>C. elegans </I> has never been known to pathogenic to humans, and would be more difficult to modify for such a purpose than a chassis like <I>E. coli</I>. which has well known pathogenic strains. That being said, the novel nature of the <I>C. elegans </I> chassis does carry some risks. The organism has been known to exist symbiotically with some bacteria. <I>C. elegans’</I> known harmlessness could be a bioterrorism advantage, with the worm acting as a carrier to deliver pathogens past biological detection systems. The worm is also more advanced than <I>E. coli</I>,  and is able to access a significant genetic arsenal  (via splicing, RNAi, etc.) that is barred from  lower organisms. As an eukaryotic organism, the worm is also more robust than its bacterial counterparts. It is insensitive to antibiotics because reproductive nature gives it a greater genetic diversity than most bacteria. A pathogenic <I>C. elegans </I> would be significantly harder to kill than bacteria yielding the same genetic weapons. Regardless, we still think <I>C. elegans </I> is a low risk chassis. While its novel nature does confer some unique options for harmful purposes,  a simple chassis like <I>E. coli</I> offers significantly more potential for such purposes . <I>E. coli</I> propagates more quickly, is simpler, and thus more easily manipulated than <I>C. elegans</I>.

Our biobricks are considered safe. Many of our parts are naturally occurring genetic sequences in <I>C. elegans </I> and thus cannot be classified as transgenic.  Our transgenic components are GPCRs taken from higher eukaryotic organisms such as mice and humans. None of our parts are known to produce toxic or infective effects.
