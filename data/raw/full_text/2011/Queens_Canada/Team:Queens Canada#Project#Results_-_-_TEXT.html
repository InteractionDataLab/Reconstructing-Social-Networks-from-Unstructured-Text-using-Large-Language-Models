Chemotactic Index
In order to characterize our chemotaxis constructs we used a testing method involving our target chemical . With our chemotaxis results, we created a chemotactic index to quantify our results. This index is defined as follows:
After almost two months of characterization (including post-regional Americas Jamboree), we successfully quantified our constructs ability to modify the chemotaxis mechanism of C. elegans . All characterization data will be uploaded to each part's page in the registry for the iGEM World Championship Jamboere.
