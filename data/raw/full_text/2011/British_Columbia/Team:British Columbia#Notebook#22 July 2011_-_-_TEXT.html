Human Practices Laura is very excited to meet with Mrs. Anderson on Monday to discuss our teams involvement in the Future Science Leaders program at Science World! Science World British Columbia is a non-profit organization which engages British Columbians in science and inspires future science and technology leadership throughout our province. The Future Science Leaders is a program offered to high school students who are keen and bright and want to further their understanding of science. Through weekly meetings the program will cover several difference sciences such as biology, mathematics, technology, physical sciences, earth and space, and technology. We as an iGEM team have the privilege of presenting our project to this group of high school students and their parents. We will also be educating the students on the diverse applications of synthetic biology and give a brief tutorial about what synthetic biology is! There is also an opportunity to promote the idea of a high school iGEM team for next year. I am anticipating this meeting and hope to get some feedback and advice for other related Human Practice projects.
(-)-limonene
Re-do PCR to get the synthase off of the pET101 plasmid onto the yeast plasmid
Troubleshooting: Decrease the extension time to 30sec (15sec/1kb) with an annealing temperature of 70C
Transform original plasmid (pADM743) into DH5alpha cells
beta-pinene
cPCR colonies from biobrick plates (using G1004,G1005 primers)
Gel verification shows no bands
cPCR same colonies from biobrick plates using a new batch of G1004/G1005 primers as well as VF2/VR
Restriction Digest yeast plasmids and synthase
Ligate 8 versions together:
original + his-tagged + GAL
original + his-tagged + GDP
original + no-his + GAL
original + no-his + GDP
SDM + his-tagged + GAL
SDM + his-tagged + GDP
SDM + no-his + GAL
SDM + no-his + GDP
Transformation
Transformed ligated samples into E.coli
