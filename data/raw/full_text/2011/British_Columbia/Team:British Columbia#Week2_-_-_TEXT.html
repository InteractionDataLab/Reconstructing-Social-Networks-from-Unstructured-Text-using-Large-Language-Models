Monday
Dr. Joanne Fox begins a week of iGEM laboratory training in AMBL, the teaching lab in Michael Smith Laboratories. The training sessions run from 10am-4pm; Joanne provided short lectures so everyone understands the magic that goes on behind the actual bench work. Today, those present learned about restriction digests, and then set up restriction digests of the insert and vector in the morning. In the afternoon, we learned about purification kits, CIP assays, and ligation.

Wednesday
Marianne and Vicki (returning team members) went over labeling etiquette, lab book organization, and the 3-antibiotic method in the morning. In the afternoon, the team returned to AMBL to conduct transformation experiments on Monday's ligated parts.
Thursday
We did plate analysis, and started a culture for plasmid preps. Not everyone had colonies on their plates, so some had to steal others' colonies to start the culture.
In the afternoon, the team met up to discuss the pine beetle project in more detail - the objectives, the future applications/implications, the parts we need, the wet lab, modeling, and human practices components.
Friday
We mini-prepped the plasmids.
