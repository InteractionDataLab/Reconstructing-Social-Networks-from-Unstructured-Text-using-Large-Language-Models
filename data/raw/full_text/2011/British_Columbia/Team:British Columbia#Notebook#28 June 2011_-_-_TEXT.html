Training: went over PCR protocol (SDM specific)
beta-pinene & (-)-limonene synthase
Ran SDM-PCR
3-Carene
Daisy did a single digest with EcoRI-HF to test if the EcoRI site is in the synthase or not. Chris Keeling emailed Daisy the sequence he used for the truncation of the 3-Carene synthase. Daisy ordered primers to do the sequencing. However, Alina has not replied to her email to confirm that the primers are ordered.
