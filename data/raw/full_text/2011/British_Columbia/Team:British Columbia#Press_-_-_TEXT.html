UBC iGEM 2011 GOLD MEDAL, BEST MODEL, ADVANCING TO FINALS!!!
   
The UBC iGEM team had a VERY successful weekend at the iGEM Americas Regionals synthetic biology research competition held this past weekend in Indianapolis.  The UBC team earned a gold medal status for their research project AND won a special award for Best Model.  This is the best showing for UBC ever and the team will now advance to the World Championships held at MIT in Boston, Nov 4-6th. We would like to thank everyone who has helped us for the inspiration, advice, patience, and support that you've provided for our talented set of students.  We couldn’t have done it without you.
2011 UBC iGEM Achievements: UBC iGEM team earns a gold medal award for their research project on combating the pine beetle outbreak by producing terpenes in yeast. UBC iGEM team selected as finalist to advance to iGEM synthetic biology World Championships at MIT in Boston, Nov 4-6. UBC iGEM team wins special award for Best Model for their modelling work creating both a MATLAB simulation of metabolic pathways to guide their work at the bench, and a model of the potential impacts on the pine beetle epidemic with data from the Ministry of Forestry. UBC was one of only 10 Canadian teams in the Americas division. 68 teams in total competed the Americas Regional Jamboree. Only 25 teams advanced to finals.
