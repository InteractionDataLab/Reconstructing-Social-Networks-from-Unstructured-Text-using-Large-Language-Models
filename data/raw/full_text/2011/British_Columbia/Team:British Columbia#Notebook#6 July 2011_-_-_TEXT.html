beta-pinene
Gel verification of the SDM product shows bands of the correct size suggesting that the SDM was successful.
(-)-limonene
Gel verification of the SDM product shows some lanes with smears, and another with 2 bands suggesting unspecified annealing of primers. SDM failed.
Troubleshooting: DMSO could be lowering the Tm of the primers; Repeat the SDM PCR without adding DMSO for one sample, without adding MgCl2 for another sample. Use the ramping cycling condition previously indicated.
Gel verification of the SDM product shows no bands. Addition of DMSO and MgCl2 is not the problem.
1,8-Cineole
Ran another SDM on pg-tps-cin, this time with more PFU. The gel suggests that it worked! Jacob then transformed E. coli with this product.
