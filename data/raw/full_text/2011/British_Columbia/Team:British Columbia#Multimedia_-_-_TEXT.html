So you want to be an iGEMer
What is Synthetic Biology?
A Day in the Life of an iGEMer
The idea behind the video was to provide a sneak peek for Young Scientists to see what a lab looks like, where we do research and all the exciting things go on.
We incorporated safety considerations such as:
Always have proper footwear (ie. bare feet is UNACCEPTABLE and flip flops aren’t good either)
Wear long pants
Have long hair tied back
No food or drink in the lab (fuel up before you head in!)
Wear a lab coat
Always work with someone else in the lab, never work alone.
Wear gloves (for sanitary high-fives)
Use a proper lab notebook to keep a record of your lab work
and many other things that can be spotted in the video...
