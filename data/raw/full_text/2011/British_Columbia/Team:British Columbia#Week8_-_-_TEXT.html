Monday
Gurpal gave a modeling presentation - indicating the parameters that are needed, and how the wetlab will be incorporated into the model.
Laura contacted Science World (for human practices), and we will be doing a presentation and workshop on synthetic biology. This still needs to be planned.
Joe's started his SDM on alpha-pinene, but it hasn't been working. He's been troubleshooting (DNA contamination? Enzyme is too old? Wrong annealing temperature?)
The team agrees that the amount of e-mails is ridiculous; everyone is getting lost! Laura volunteers to develop e-mail lingo to organize the e-mails and to help direct e-mail traffic to the appropriate people.
Tuesday
3-Carene
Daisy picked several colonies to screen for the mutations. She picked several colonies and inoculated them in LB culture for overnight growth.
Wednesday
Gurpal and Sam started making competent cells.
Thursday
Gurpal and Sam finished making competent cells.
3-Carene
Daisy miniprepped the plasmids.
Friday
Saturday
Gurpal and Sam validated their competent cells by looking at transformation efficiency.
