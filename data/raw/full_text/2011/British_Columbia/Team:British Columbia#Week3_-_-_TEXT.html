Monday
Mondays are when we have our weekly open lab meetings where interested faculty members/advisers as well as iGEM club members attend to hear about our project, provide any input/guidance. Today, we presented our project proposal to our advisers. The next step is to obtain all our necessary parts (Chris Keeling is generously giving us synthases) and to further develop our human practices and modeling routes.

Wednesday
Our first iGEM team social = bonding time! We all went to the Indian Oven to have dinner, discuss our project, and watch a part of the hockey game (Go Canucks!). It was semi-productive (in terms of project discussion)
