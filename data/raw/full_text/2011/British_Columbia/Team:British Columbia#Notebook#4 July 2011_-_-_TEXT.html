IDI1, HMG2, erg20-2
Validated competent cells by transforming with pet100 vector containing Cineole synthase.  They are in working order.
Amplified 5 plasmids received from Greece (IDI1, HMG2, p300, Cin, Sab).  NOTE: did not properly centrifuge during DNA precipitation stage.  Will validate plasmids in yeast transformations to make sure plasmids are in working order.
Awaiting materials from France (erg20-2).
1,8-Cineole
Ran a gel to test restriction digest on variant SDM-PCR product. Looks like the SDM was successful!
beta-pinene & (-)-limonene
SDM beta-pinene again by using both Pfu and Taq.
Gel verification shows a smear.
Troubleshooting: run a gel on the miniprep of the beta-pinene plasmid received from Rafael to make sure that the DNA hasn't been contaminated/digested.
