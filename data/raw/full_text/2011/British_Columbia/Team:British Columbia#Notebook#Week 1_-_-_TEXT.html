Week 1: June 5-11
Lab Meeting - June 6
Great news! We've received funding from Service Canada: Summer Canada Jobs! Everyone is super stoked that we have money for travel expenses (Thank you Dr. Foster!).
During our lab meeting, we realized that there were illegal cut sites within our synthase genes and we now must remove these sites by introducing silent mutations via site-directed mutagenesis (SDM). Rafael, one of our beloved grad advisors gave a tutorial on PCR, SDM and primer design.
June 8
Albert (the post-doc in the Ellis Lab) gave the entire team a safety orientation of the lab. We can now start doing experiments!
June 10-11
Yeast reagents
Alina (grad advisor) walked through the yeast transformation protocol with the team (a day before she went on vacation in Singapore and Taiwan!).
