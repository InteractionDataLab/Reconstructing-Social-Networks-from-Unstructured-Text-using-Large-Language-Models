What is Synthetic Biology?
by: syntheticbiology
iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method.
Synthetic Biology
We are a group of individuals, groups and labs from various institutions who are committed to engineering biology in an open and ethical manner.
SynBio World
We are a group of synthetic biology students who strongly believe in the power of the web of data and of new communication technologies. We want to empower our research field with these new technologies to help people meet, share experiences, cooperate and in the end advance science.
Synthetic Biology Project
The Project aims to foster informed public and policy discourse concerning the advancement of synthetic biology – an emerging interdisciplinary field that uses advanced science and engineering to make or re-design living organisms, such as bacteria, so they can carry out specific functions.
Synbiosafe
Synthetic Biology is the attempt to design and create new life forms - life the world has never seen before. Discover a living technology that will change the way we think about livings systems and machines in the future. "SYNBIOSAFE" gives a fundamental insight into this future technology and its real world applications. The documentary film also sheds a light on the benefits and risks of synthetic biology and what it means for our future society.
BIO:FICTION
Biotech-labs around the world are busy in the field of Synthetic Biology – a new approach to engineer “life” and living systems. Synthetic biology aims at applying engineering principles to biology. The DNA of an organism is no longer manipulated, but programmed on a computer and built up from scratch. Bio:Fiction is the Synthetic Biology Science, Art and Film Festival.
The Scientist
The Scientist is the magazine for life science professionals—a print and digital publication dedicated to covering a wide range of topics central to the study of cell and molecular biology, genetics, and other life-science fields. Through innovative print articles, online stories, and multimedia features, the magazine explores the latest scientific discoveries, trends in research, innovative techniques, new technology, business, and careers. It is read by leading researchers in industry and academia who value penetrating analyses and broad perspectives on life-science topics both within and beyond their areas of expertise. Written by prominent scientists and professional journalists, articles in The Scientist are concise, accurate, accessible, and entertaining
Amyris
Amyris is building an integrated renewable products company. Founded in 2003 and based in Emeryville, CA, Amyris is using breakthrough science and an innovative business model to address some of our planet’s most daunting problems.
