Monday
Brainstorm Project Ideas
The team came together and compiled a list of potential iGEM projects:
"Do It Yourself" biology (ex. build PCR machine)
Optogenetics
Chemo-signalling (using antibodies as signals)
Rerouting networks (creating fusion proteins that make extra interactions to interfere with natural protein links)
Eradicate bed bugs
Eradicate pine beetles
Battery waste
Photo-dynamic inhibition (bacteria are killed by light)
Biomolecules
Use DNA to control enzymatic reactions
Tuesday
Brainstorm Project Ideas
The team came up with a few more ideas (ex. making bacteria clean water, cholera, inteins) and then shortlisted the ideas. Sam, Gurpal, and Joe will research photovoltaics. Marianne, Daisy, and Joe will research the cholera toxin; Vicki and Jacob will research bedbugs.
Wednesday
Brainstorm Project Ideas
We came together to discuss the shortlist of projects, and decided to focus on researching the potential pros and cons for cholera receptors and pine beetle pheromones.
Thursday
Everyone was very passionate about the pine beetle project because of the relevant applications to the forests of British Columbia. Further, there is expertise close at home to collaborate with. Returning team members learned that it was difficult to obtain resources and hard to collaborate with scientists who were not in the same province (and country).
We established what we already know from the research we've done as well as gaps of knowledge. Some of our team members searched and contacted people relevant to our project to further discuss our project's feasibility. We also briefly discussed the objectives of our project.
