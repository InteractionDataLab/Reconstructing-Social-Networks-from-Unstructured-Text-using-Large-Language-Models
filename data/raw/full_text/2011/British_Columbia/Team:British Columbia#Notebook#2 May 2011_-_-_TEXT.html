Brainstorm Project Ideas
The team came together and compiled a list of potential iGEM projects:
"Do It Yourself" biology (ex. build PCR machine)
Optogenetics
Chemo-signalling (using antibodies as signals)
Rerouting networks (creating fusion proteins that make extra interactions to interfere with natural protein links)
Eradicate bed bugs
Eradicate pine beetles
Battery waste
Photo-dynamic inhibition (bacteria are killed by light)
Biomolecules
Use DNA to control enzymatic reactions
