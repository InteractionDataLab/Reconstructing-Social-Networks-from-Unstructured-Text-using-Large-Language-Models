beta-pinene
PCR off the synthase using yeast primers (contains XhoI and SpeI restriction enzyme sites) in order to put into the yeast plasmid
PCR off the synthase using biobrick primers (contains EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI restriction enzyme sites) in order to put into psb1C3
Gel verification for both PCRs shows bands at the correct length
(-)-limonene
PCR off the synthase using yeast primers (contains SpeI and NotI restriction enzyme sites) in order to put into the yeast plasmid
Gel veriification shows 4 bands - PCR failed
SDM PCR the synthase using new primers
