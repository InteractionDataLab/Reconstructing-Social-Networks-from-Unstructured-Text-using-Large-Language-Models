Everyone was very passionate about the pine beetle project because of the relevant applications to the forests of British Columbia. Further, there is expertise close at home to collaborate with. Returning team members learned that it was difficult to obtain resources and hard to collaborate with scientists who were not in the same province (and country).
We established what we already know from the research we've done as well as gaps of knowledge. Some of our team members searched and contacted people relevant to our project to further discuss our project's feasibility. We also briefly discussed the objectives of our project.
