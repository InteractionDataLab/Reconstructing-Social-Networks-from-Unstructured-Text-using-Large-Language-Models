MODEL 1: Secretion and Production of Monoterpenes in Yeast
OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to assay the secretion and production of monoterpenes in yeast.
MODEL 2: Dynamics of Mountain Pine Beetle Populations in British Columbia
OBJECTIVE: To construct a mathematical model that can predict the dynamics of the mountain pine beetle populations in B.C. under the influence of our synthetic product. This model can be coupled with the strategic planning for future conservation initiatives.
