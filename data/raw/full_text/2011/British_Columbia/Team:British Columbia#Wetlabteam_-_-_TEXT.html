Gurpal Bisra: My contribution to our wet lab component was to alter a yeast cell to contain the mutant erg20-2 gene instead of the wild type erg20 gene. I am making yeast bio-bricks for the erg20 and erg20-2 genes. Additionally, I am assisting Samuel Wu to develop plasmids that contain the K6R-HMG2 and IDI1 genes.
