Lab Meeting - June 13
Overall, we had a productive meeting; we received updates on wetlab and modeling.
Daisy has started work on the 3-carene synthase, and Gurpal is working on getting the erg20-2 mutant yeast plasmid delivered from France.
The modeling team met with different UBC professors to discuss the model and to ask for advice.
3-Carene
Daisy is working with the 3-carene monoterpene synthase that contains three restriction sites that need to be removed: EcoRI, XbaI, PstI. She worked hard, SDMing away over the weekend and has now only one more site to modify. We learnt from Chris Keeling that the truncated version of the synthase will increase the efficiency of the enzyme.
In other news...
The Vancouver Canucks lost to the Boston Bruins. It was a sad day for all... Maybe next year, the cup will be ours. Just maybe.
