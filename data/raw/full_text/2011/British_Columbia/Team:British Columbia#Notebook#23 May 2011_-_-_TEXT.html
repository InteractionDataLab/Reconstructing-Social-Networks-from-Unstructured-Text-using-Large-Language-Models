Leading up to the Finals!
May 23 2011
We had our first modeling meeting at Blenz. Our modeling adviser, Shing, provided guidance on modeling the monoterpene production by yeast (model 1). Model 3 (google Earth) was briefly discussed and model 2 (protein homologue). Action items were established, and interested team members volunteered to work on a specific model: Gurpal and Sam will work on model 1 and 2, while Joe and Jacob work on model 3.
