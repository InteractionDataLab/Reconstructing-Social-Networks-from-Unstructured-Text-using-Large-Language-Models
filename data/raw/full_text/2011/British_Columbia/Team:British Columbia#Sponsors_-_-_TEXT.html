The role of each team member of the 2011 UBC iGEM team is described on this page under our individual profiles on our team page . Our team has worked diligently on not only wet lab, modeling and outreach components of the project, but also on seeking out funding and other resources for our research. We are exceedingly grateful to our faculty advisors who have provided us with valuable guidance and insight. Members of the labs of Phil Hieter, Joerg Bohlmann, Brian Ellis and Leonard Foster have also helped to mentor the team, guide them through protocols and provide important resources for our experiments. For our wet lab work, we thank Dr. Chris Keeling who not only provided us with the original monoterpene synthase genes but has also been very dedicated in teaching us how to assay monoterpene synthesis. We acknowledge Dr. Katrin Geisler and Dr. Anne Caniard for their patience and help with diterpene production in yeast and data analysis. In addition, we would like to acknowledge that our GC-MS data was generated by Lina Madilao from the Wine Research Centre, who was patient and kind in guiding several team members through the data analysis.
Human Practices Collaborators
Dr. Catherine Anderson from The Future Science Leaders program at Science World for allowing us to present to the bright young students and share our passion for Science with them.
