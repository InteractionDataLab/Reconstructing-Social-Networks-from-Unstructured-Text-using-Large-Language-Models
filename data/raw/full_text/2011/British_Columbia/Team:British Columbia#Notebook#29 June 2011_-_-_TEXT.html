Leading up to the Finals!
June 29 2011
Training: The plan was to make kanamycin plates, but this was at a stand-still as we had troubles locating the tube of kanamycin sulfate salt.
beta-pinene & (-)-limonene synthase
Verified yesterday's SDM-PCR products through gel electrophoresis. No bands were present in any of the lanes.
Troubleshooting: The dNTP could have been too old/contaminated (we had troubles with this particular tube of dNTP from last year); the concentrations for the reagents used were not optimized - Marianne researched protocols and optimized the SDM-PCR protocol. We (Vicki and Marianne) will test it tomorrow.
1,8-Cineole
Jacob transformed competent cells with his SDM-PCR product.  Also ran SDM-PCR on variant of original synthase.
