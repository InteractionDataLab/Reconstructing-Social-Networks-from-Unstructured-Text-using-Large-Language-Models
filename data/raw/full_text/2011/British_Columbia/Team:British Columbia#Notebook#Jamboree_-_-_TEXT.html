We'll be back at MIT!!!The UBC iGEM team had a VERY successful weekend at the iGEM Americas Regionals synthetic biology research competition held this past weekend in Indianapolis.  The UBC team earned a gold medal status for their research project AND won a special award for Best Model.  This is the best showing for UBC ever and the team will now advance to the World Championships held at MIT in Boston, Nov 4-6th. We would like to thank everyone who has helped us for the inspiration, advice, patience, and support that you've provided for our talented set of students.  We couldn’t have done it without you.
