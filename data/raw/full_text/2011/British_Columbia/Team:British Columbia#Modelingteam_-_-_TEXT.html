Gurpal Bisra: My contribution to the modeling component of our project was to simulate the biochemical pathways for our genetically engineered yeasts. I programmed simulations using the SimBiology Toolkit in MATLAB. Every yeast cell is designed to produce one specific monoterpene in mass, and others monterpenes in small amounts. Furthermore, I am assisting Jacob Toth and Joe Ho develop another model which shows the spread of the pine beetle using ARCGIS.
