May 12 2011
We did plate analysis, and started a culture for plasmid preps. Not everyone had colonies on their plates, so some had to steal others' colonies to start the culture.
In the afternoon, the team met up to discuss the pine beetle project in more detail - the objectives, the future applications/implications, the parts we need, the wet lab, modeling, and human practices components.
