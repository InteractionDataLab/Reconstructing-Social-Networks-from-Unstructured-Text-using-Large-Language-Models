Monday
We had our first modeling meeting at Blenz. Our modeling adviser, Shing, provided guidance on modeling the monoterpene production by yeast (model 1). Model 3 (google Earth) was briefly discussed and model 2 (protein homologue). Action items were established, and interested team members volunteered to work on a specific model: Gurpal and Sam will work on model 1 and 2, while Joe and Jacob work on model 3.
Tuesday
Because Monday (the 23rd) was Victoria Day, we had our usual open lab meeting today. Prior to the usual lab meeting, Daisy presented Chris Keeling's 2011 Transcriptome Mining paper. We then discussed the methods section, and outlined the reagents, protocols, and any equipment that we may need. Sam and Gurpal found papers from Greece and France that used other genes (mutant erg20-2, IDI1) that may aid in increasing the yield of monoterpenes by yeast; they will e-mail the respective principal investigators.

The team met up to discuss possible tracks, and came up with a "Synthase" track, and an "Extra parts" track. Marianne, Vicki, Daisy, Jacob, and Joe will be on the "Synthase" track, each taking on a different synthase; on the other hand, Laura, Gurpal, and Sam will be on the "Extra parts" track and will be in charge of liaising between us and the PI's in Greece and France in order to obtain the relevant plasmids/genes from them. Vicki will write up the sponsorship package so everyone can begin contacting potential sponsors to obtain more funding.
