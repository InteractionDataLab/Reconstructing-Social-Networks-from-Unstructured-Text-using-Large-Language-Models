Poster and Presentation
The team is busy working on their poster and presentation.
aGEM
Joanne and Jacob went to aGEM, a pre-jamboree iGEM meetup based in Alberta. Jacob had the opportunity to give UBC's presentation to a group of judges and the students from the Alberta teams. He received some great feedback about the project and presentation, saw  the fantastic presentations from the Alberta teams, and had the opportunity to chat with the judges about the future of synthetic biology. It was an amazing experience!
Expression of Beta-pinene bacteria
Daisy purified the pellets of beta-pinene that Joe prepare a week ago and store at -80C. She is certain that there is beta-pinene in these cells because previous SDS-page data shows a strong band slightly below 70kDa ( the size of both alpha and beta-pinene synthases). Well, she performed a GPP assay and prepared those samples for GC-MS , and surprising it came out that the beta-pinene synthase was producing alpha-pinene and mostly beta-pinene:
Sample GC-MS data for our beta-pinene synthase as expressed by C41 E. coli
