(-)-limonene
DpnI digest yesterday's SDM PCR products at 37C for 4 hours
Gel verification of SDM PCR products show no bands. PCR failed.
PCR off the synthase to put onto yeast plasmid
Troubleshooting: Use gradient, from 64C to 72C
Gel verification of PCR products for all samples show 4 bands (same as yesterday). This may indicate, again, unspecific binding.
beta-pinene
Assembling biobrick part
Digest psb1C3 and synthase (part) with EcoRI and PstI using Biobrick Restriction Digest protocol
Ligate backbone and part using Biobrick Ligation protocol
Transform assembly into DH5alpha cells
1,8-cineole
Assembling biobrick part.
Second PCR did not work
Third PCR set to run overnight
