We have finally secured a lab space (Thank you Ellis Lab!), and are in the process of moving equipment, unpacking, organizing, and ordering lacking supplies and/or reagents.
The sponsorship package is done, and we brainstormed potential companies/organizations to approach.
Gurpal has started working on model 1. He's found that Matlab would be the best program to use, and has gone through the SimBiology Kit Tutorials. He has also started writing out the biological pathways to produce monoterpenes.
Jacob and Joe have begun researching model 3 and started contacting relevant professors at UBC.
