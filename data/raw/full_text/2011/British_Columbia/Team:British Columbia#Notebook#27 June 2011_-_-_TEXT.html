June 27 2011
We created a set of lab rules due to common mistakes made in the lab over the past few weeks.
Vicki and Marianne will having training sessions throughout the week to show team members without much wetlab experience how to PCR, cast and run a gel, digest, ligate, transform, design primers, send miniprepped products to be sequenced.
Competent cells - tested, and they're competent! Good job Gurpal and Sam!
Modeling: Jacob obtained the ArcGIS program. Gurpal wants to create a wetlab flow chart to match the modeling.
Sent DspB (part from last year) to Grinnell College (a new iGEM team this year who requested our part) in the United States.
alpha-pinene synthase
SDM-PCR worked! (Used the QuikChange SDM Kit protocol).
3-carene synthase
Daisy needs to make custom primers for sequencing purposes because the mutagen site is in the middle of the coding sequence and her flanking primers will only sequence 700-800bp into the sequence.
beta-pinene synthase
Resuspended SDM forward and reverse primers
(-)-limonene synthase
Resuspended SDM forward and reverse primers
1,8-Cineole
Ran successful SDM-PCR to remove a restriction site.
