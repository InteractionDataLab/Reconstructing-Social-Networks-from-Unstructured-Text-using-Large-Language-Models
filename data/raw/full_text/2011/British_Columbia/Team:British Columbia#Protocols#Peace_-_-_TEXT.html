iGEM Tips for Success
Things to think about when designing your project and experiments, as well as general safety rules.
Site Directed Mutagenesis
A molecular biology technique in which a mutation is created at a defined site in a DNA molecule.
Bacterial Standard Operating Protocols
How to prepare competent cells, transform your construct into competent cells, and express your protein from a lac promoter.
Yeast Standard Operating Protocols
How to transform your construct into yeast, obtain crude extract for SDS-PAGE, and perform GFP fixation for microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
A method that combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample.
Beetle Transfer Experiments
Preliminary experiments to probe the efficiency of transferring yeast via beetle vector.
Yeast-Fungi Co-culture Experiments
Preliminary experiments to investigate the competitive interactions between yeast and the Bluestain Fungus.

iGEM Tips for Success
Make sure that all the resources you need are easily obtainable; it is ideal to base your project on something similar to research being performed at your home university so that you can take advantage of the expertise and facilities on campus.
Unless you have enough money to synthesize all your parts, it is best to estimate that one month will be required to perform all the site directed mutagenesis you need to remove all the illegal biobrick cut sites. However, if you have considerable codon bias in your genes that may cause poor expression in your chassis, synthesizing your gene and optimizing codon usage is probably a very good investment.
Make your wet lab, modeling and human practices components highly interconnected so that you can use data from each component to feedback into other components
Read the medal criteria VERY CAREFULLY e.g. for the Gold Medal criteria of characterizing an existing part, it is easiest to characterize a promoter using a fluorescent protein reporter construct.
Our iGEM team Safety Rules
Every team member in the lab has taken the introductory biological and chemical laboratory safety course.
We have a 8am - 9pm work hours curfew for our iGEM laboratory work.
iGEM students will never work alone in the laboratory, you'll always have someone else there with you. This is for safety.
The iGEM supervisors are Alina Chan and Rafael Saer. If you are ever in need of a supervisor and you can not reach them, you should come find Dr. Joanne Fox.
We also have contact information for all team members in our safety binder which is located on the iGEM lab bench.
Our Ellis lab contact is: Albert Cairo; Our Bohlmann lab contact is: Karen Reid.
