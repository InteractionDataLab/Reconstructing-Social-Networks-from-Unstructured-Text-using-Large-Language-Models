Leading up to the Finals!
May 27 2011
The team met up to discuss possible tracks, and came up with a "Synthase" track, and an "Extra parts" track. Marianne, Vicki, Daisy, Jacob, and Joe will be on the "Synthase" track, each taking on a different synthase; on the other hand, Laura, Gurpal, and Sam will be on the "Extra parts" track and will be in charge of liaising between us and the PI's in Greece and France in order to obtain the relevant plasmids/genes from them. Vicki will write up the sponsorship package so everyone can begin contacting potential sponsors to obtain more funding.
