Laura: I am very enthusiastic about biology and passionate for people so it is a natural fit for me to be spearheading the Human Practices aspect of our project. I am keen to engage the community in discussions about synthetic biology in non-traditional ways... Creative art projects, videos, forums, roadside chats... Also, It is especially exciting to be partnering with Science World in mentoring and educating Vancouver high school students. We hope to inspire these teenagers to pursue future opportunities in Science... and maybe even a 2012 Vancouver Highschool iGEM team!
