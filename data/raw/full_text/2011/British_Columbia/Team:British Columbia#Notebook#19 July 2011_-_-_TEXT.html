1,8-cineole
Despite not getting any sequencing results, the restriction digest gels clearly showed that there were no cut sites in the synthase, so Jacob decided to try getting the synthases on biobricks. Today, Jacob ran a biobrick PCR to add the proper prefix and suffix to his synthase, but it did not work.
Miscellanea
New ampicillin plates were made, and the pag 413 GPD plasmid (for putting our synthases in yeast) was amplified. After the plasmid was amplified, the team decided to use another plasmid, making the amplified pag 413 GPD plasmid irrelevant for the project.
