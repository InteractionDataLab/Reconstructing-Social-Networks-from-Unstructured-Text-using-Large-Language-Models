Great news! We've received funding from Service Canada: Summer Canada Jobs! Everyone is super stoked that we have money for travel expenses (Thanks Dr. Foster!)
Gurpal has started writing out the biological pathways to produce monoterpenes in yeast (model 1).
After the weekly lab meeting, Rafael (grad adviser) gave a tutorial on PCR, SDM, and primer design.
Problem: We found illegal cut sites within our synthase genes, and now must remove these cut sites by introducing a silent mutation via site-directed mutagenesis.

Albert (the post-doc in the Ellis Lab) gave the entire team a safety orientation of the lab. We can now start doing experiments!
