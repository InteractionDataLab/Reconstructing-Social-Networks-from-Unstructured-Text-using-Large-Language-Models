  David Golynskiy
I was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and immigrated to America in 1997. Currently, I am attending University of Texas at Dallas as a senior and I will graduate as a double major in Biology and Criminology. This is an amazing opportunity for all undergrads because it allows you to be creative with knowledge learned as well as get hands on experience.
