The Team
Tyler Guinn
I am a 4th year undergraduate doing a dual degree in Biochemistry and Electrical Engineering. This is my first year in iGEM and I think this is an amazing idea to get students more actively involved with synthetic biology.
idea, design and wet lab (immunobot assemblies), all characterization
 
Sameer Sant
I am a junior studying Biology and Economics. iGEM last year was the most fun I've ever had, so I am very excited to participate again.
idea, lab training, final wiki layout and documentation
 
Mitu Bhattatiry
I am Mitu Bhattatiry and I am going to be a freshman at Columbia University this year. This is my second year of iGEM and I am really looking forward to the Jamboree!
idea, design and wet lab (killswitch assembly)
 
Chris Brasseaux
I am an Electrical Engineering student with interests in software and Bioengineering. This is my first year at IGEMs and has been a great opportunity to learn about this new and exciting field!
idea, miscellaneous wet lab, modeling and simulation
 
Nimi Bhattatiry
I am a high school student and will be a Junior at Coppell High School next year. This is my first summer of iGEM and I'm excited to be part of the UTDallas iGEM team!
initial wiki layout and documentation
 
David Golynskiy
I am a 4th year undergraduate doing a dual degree in Biology and Criminology. This is an amazing opportunity for all undergrads because it allows you to be creative with knowledge learned as well as get hands on experience.
