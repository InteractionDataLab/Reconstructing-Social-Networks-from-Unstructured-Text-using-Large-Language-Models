Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>- pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity?</B></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><B>- threats to environmental quality?</B></BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>- security concerns?</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:</B></P><P><B>a.

Risks to environmental quality if released by design or accident?</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE>Our laboratory activity is consistent with the NIH “Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules” as overseen by our Institutional Biosafety Committee (see question 3). While we handle all laboratory materials that pose a potential safety risk according to standard lab safety protocol and Materials Safety Data Sheets, we took the following steps to ensure that the health and safety of laboratory personnel remained a priority when using certain materials and equipment as outlined below: <P><B>Ethidium bromide (EtBr):</B> All EtBr use is strictly performed on a designated bench with separately kept equipment (pipettes, tips, waste receptacle, gloves etc). Any materials that come in contact with EtBr, including gels used in electrophoresis, are handled with nitrile gloves and lab apron and disposed in specially marked receptacle with a “biohazard” designation.</P><P><B>Cell culture: </B>While our bacterial chassis, E. coli DH5α, is disabled to where it is
nonpathogenic and cannot survive outside of lab conditions, we exercised standard
lab safety protocol to avoid any direct contact with it and associated materials such
as antibiotics and exposed tips, plates/broth, and so on. These are all disposed
in “biohazard” designated receptacles. Furthermore, all exposed counters are
disinfected using 70% ethanol immediately following cell culture and also after each
other use of lab. In addition, lab equipment is thoroughly cleaned and autoclaved after
use.
</P><P><B>UV Transluminator: </B>Use of the transluminator (i.e. during gel extraction) was
performed while wearing protective gear such as UV-protective goggles. Further
exposure to UV rays and hazardous materials was limited by wearing a long-sleeved
lab apron and nitrile gloves.</P>

d. Risks to security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states?

<P>Access to our building and laboratory is strictly limited by cardkey and is further. </P>

overseen by security personnel at the building entrance.</BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>2. If your response to any of the questions above is yes:</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>a. Explain how you addressed these issues in project design and while conducting
laboratory work.</P>

See question 1

<P>b. Describe and document safety, security, health and/or environmental issues as you
submit your parts to the Registry.</P><P>We are working with genes encoding known properties and utilized safety measures
to ensure that biohazardous materials including antibiotic-resistant cells are contained
within the lab and are appropriately disposed. Therefore, we assess that none of our
planned parts raise safety issues and all other documentation will be available on our
parts page.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>3. Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>a. Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they? Provide a
link to them online if possible.</P><P>b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group?
If yes, have you discussed your project with them?</P><P>UT Dallas has an Institutional Biosafety Committee (http://provost.utdallas.edu/policy/
utdpp1016) that manages all safety responsibilities under NIH “Guidelines for Research
Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules”. Throughout the course of this work, we
ensured that all lab activity respected safety measures.</P><P>Describe any concerns or changes that were made based on this review.</P><P>c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project?
If so, describe this training.</P><P>Our instructors demonstrated use of all equipment and materials in accordance with
safety guidelines. This training included an emphasis on wearing protective gear at all
times, proper use of large machines such as the autoclave, waste disposal, and specific
comments on the use of EtBr-exposed materials.</P><P>d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a
link to them online if possible.</P><P>The NIH outlines specific “Guildlines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA
Molecules” (http://oba.od.nih.gov/rdna/nih_guidelines_oba.html), which were strictly
observed throughout the course of our project.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>4. OPTIONAL QUESTION: Do you have other ideas on how to deal with safety or
security issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could
parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?</B></P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size="3" face="arial">As part of our project, we are engineering a systemic kill-switch whose induction can
be used to regulate the activity of cells harboring our BioBricks. This device will exist in
a secondary bacterial population that will confer an additional level of user control. We
would encourage fast-acting kill-switches as standard practice in synthetic biology to
enable immediate inactivation should significant risks to safety become evident.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="sidebar"><DIV class="gadget"><H2><FONT size="5" face="Arial"><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UT_Dallas/Notebook"><FONT size="4" face="arial" color="#495B70">Back to Notebook</FONT></A></FONT></H2></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="fbg"><DIV class="col c1"><H2><SPAN>Image Gallery</SPAN></H2></DIV><DIV class="col c2"><H2><SPAN><FONT size="5" face="arial">UT Dallas</FONT></SPAN></H2><P><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UT_Dallas/UTDallas"><FONT size="3" face="verdana">Click here to learn more  about UTD</FONT></A></P></DIV><DIV class="col c3"><H2><SPAN><FONT size="5" face="arial">Notebook</FONT></SPAN></H2><P><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UT_Dallas/Notebook"><FONT size="3" face="verdana">Learn more...</FONT></A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
