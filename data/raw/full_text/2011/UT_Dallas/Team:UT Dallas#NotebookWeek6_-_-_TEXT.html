Week 6
August 15-
PCR of ptetR, RBS, LuxI, term
Gel electrophoresis and purification
Glycerol stock and miniprep
Incubation in 3 mL LB can overnight at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rpm
Test digestion  for 1 hour and 30 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius
Gel Electrophoresis
Test Digestion Observation:  Lane 5 gave positive results for FGF-R: 2 bands observed at predicted bands size. Lane 4, 7, 9 were all negative bad results because EcoRI was used but only 1 band showed. This suggests that FGFR was not inserted. Lanes 10, 11, 12 were CheZ* and all matched negative control. Results are bad for CheZ*- will be regrown/miniprep/ligated.
Incubation in 3 mL LB chlora overnight at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rpm
August 16-
Digestion; Gel Electrophoresis and Purification
Ligation (10 minutes at room temperature)
Transformation (50 µL DH5α, 2 µL DNA, 37 degrees Celsius overnight, all carb)
Re- incubating – taking 20 µL of yesterday’s incubations and placing them in 3 mL of LB and appropriate
Transformation (50 µL DH5α, 2 µL DNA, 37 degrees Celsius overnight, all carb)
August 17-
Glycerol stock ToxR and CheZ* colonies (2nd attempt)
Miniprep
no results on gel
Incubate in 3 mL LB carb overnight at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rpm
Transformation (50 µL DH5α, 2 µL DNA, 37 degrees Celsius overnight, all carb)
Incubation in 3 mL of LB chlora overnight at 37 degrees Celsius and 220 rpm
August 18-
