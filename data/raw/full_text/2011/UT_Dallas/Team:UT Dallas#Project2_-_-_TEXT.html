UT Dallas iGem Project
Tissue damage characterizes a range of medical conditions that can be particularly difficult to manage without restrictively risky or expensive intervention. The human body hosts a rich diversity of symbiotic microflora that provides a powerful engineering platform for synthetic bacterial systems. We aim to construct a probiotic solution that successfully interfaces with the immune system to facilitate localized tissue repair.
