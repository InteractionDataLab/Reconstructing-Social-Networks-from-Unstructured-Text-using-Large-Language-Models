Model and simulation
The signaling network from the input of external ligand signal to the output of the tumbling state of a E coli cell can be quantitatively described by a modular model. The model is formulated based on the law of mass action and Michaelis-Menten mechanism and contains four relatively independent modules that are explained in detail below.
Module 1: Activation of ToxR receptor
In this module, the ligand signal activates the ToxR receptor into a dimerized complex formed with the ligand, which is the active state of the receptor. The biochemical reaction can be illustrated as:
where L, R, C and C2 represent the concentration of external ligand, free receptor, recptor-ligand complex, and the dimerized receptor-ligand complex. The first reaction represents the binding/unbinding between the free receptor and the ligand. The second reaction represents the dimerization/undimerization conversions between C and C2. The conservation of the total concentration of the receptor can be written as:
where RT is the total receptor concentration. The governing differential equations of this module are:
The equations contain binding rate kfL(RT-C-2C2 ), unbinding rate krC, dimerization rate kdimC2 and undimerization rate 2kundimC2, where kf, kr, kdim and kundim represent the rate constants for binding, unbinding, dimerization and undimerization reactions. The values of the parameters are obtained from (Forsten-Williams, Chua et al. 2005). Typical simulation results in response to L=1 µM are:
where the dissociation constant for receptor-ligand binding used in the right figure is 100 times than that in the left figure.
Module 2: Transcription/translation of CheZ
In this module, the dimerized complex C2 activates the transcription of the cheZ mRNA. The reactions are the standard transcription and translation reactions illustrated as:
Where Zm and Zp represent the concentration of the mRNA and the protein product of CheZ. The formulation of the reactions follow the standard equations for transcription and translation.
Where k0 represents the basal transcription rate of Zm, k1 represents the transcription rate activated by C2, k3 represents the translational rate of Zp, and k2 and k4 represent the degradation rates of Zm and Zp. Typical simulation results are:
where the degradation rate for Zp in the right figure is 10 times than that in the left figure.
Module 3
In this module, the CheY protein is dephosphorylated by the CheZ protein and the reaction can be illustrated as:
The governing differential equation follows the format given in (Spiro, Parkinson et al. 1997)
Where YT is the total concentration of the CheY protein, and kp and kd are the phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation rate constants of CheY. The parameter values are obtained from (Spiro, Parkinson et al. 1997). Typical simulation results are:
where again the degradation rate for Zp in the right figure is 10 times than that in the left figure.
Module 4
In this module, the tumbling activity of E coli is characterized by the so-called “bias”, which is defined as the ratio of the time of directed movement and the total time. It is experimentally measured that the bias is a Hill function dependent on the concentration of phosphorylated CheY (Cluzel, Surette et al. 2000).
Using the steady-state value of Yp in the previous two figures, that is 4.08 µM or 14.25µM, the final bias is 6.6% or .01%.
