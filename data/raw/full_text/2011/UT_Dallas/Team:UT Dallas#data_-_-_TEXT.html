Data For Our Favorite New Parts
PcstA-RBS-LuxI-terminator,  BBa_K569001 ( Main Page ): This part produces LuxI,an enzyme for creating acyl-homoserine lactones from normal cell metabolites, in the absence of glucose. This part is repressed by glucose.
PyeaR-ToxR-FGFR, BBa_K569013 ( Main Page ): PyeaR is a nitrate inducible promoter. ToxR+FGFR is a receptor fusion of two dimerizing proteins. FGFR responds to FGF by dimerizing; this causes ToxR to dimerize. When ToxR is dimerized it acts as a transcription factor for the ctx promoter.
SCP-ToxR-FGFR, BBa_K569014 ( Main Page ): This part constitutively produces the ToxR+FGFR fusion protein. ToxR+FGFR dimerizes in response to FGF and can then activate the ctx promoter from the bacteria Vibrio cholera. ToxR by itself is a transcription factor, while FGFR is a immune system sensor.
Data For Pre-existing Parts
We grew PcstA-RBS-LuxI-terminator and AHL-inducible ColicinE2-GFP transformed in BL21 E.coli cells. We combined the two cultures in various ratios and either added or did not add glucose ( experience ). We allowed these samples to continue growing for 2 hours and we took measurements using a fluorescent microscope.
