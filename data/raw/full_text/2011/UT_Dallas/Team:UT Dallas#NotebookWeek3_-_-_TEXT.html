Week 3
July 25-
Incubate LB chlora for 1 hour
Negative control continued overnight
Test Experiment #1- Took 10 µL from i2.9.7 and 10 µL from i2.9.8 and mixed them together. Then plated all 20 µL onto a chlora plate. Then we covered it and LED lights in the 37 degrees Celsius incubator and let them grow overnight.
July 28-
i2.10.1 – FOFR from commercial stock, i2.10.2- negative control, i2.10.3-agar stab being plated on carb plate
Incubation FOFR colonies (3 mL of LB and carb)
Plating mutated CheZ (inoculation)
grew FOFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) which was on pCMV- SPORT6.1 in E.coli strain DH1OB
-grew FOFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) which was on pCMV- SPORT6.1 in E.coli strain DH1OB
July 29-
Making glycerol stock
Miniprep
Observations: i2.10.3 grew, i2.10.1 grew, i2.10.2 didn’t grow
Sore i2.10.5 until primers come in, then proceed to PCR, gel electrophoresis/purification, digest, gel electrophoresis/purity
July 31-
