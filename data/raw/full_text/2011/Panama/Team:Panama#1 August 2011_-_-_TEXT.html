Team:Panama/1 August 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We did miniprep of cultures containing the biobrick that we ordered to iGEM Project (USA). At the same time, we prepared everything for an electrophoresis of these miniprep´s products. We observed two bands, the first one with a weight of 1300 bp and the other one of 3000 bp.
