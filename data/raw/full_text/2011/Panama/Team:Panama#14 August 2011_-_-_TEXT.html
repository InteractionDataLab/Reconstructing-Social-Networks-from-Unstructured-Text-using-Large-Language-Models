Team:Panama/14 August 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We did an electroforesis to confirm if we still have the rh1AB mutated BioBrick, but again, we discovered that the part has been degraded because so there is no more choice than doing the project all over again, start from the beginning at this point in not an easy thing to make, but let´s see if we can accomplish the mission.
We did the transformation of TU DELFT Bricks.
Also prepared 10uM work solution of mutagenic primers ( see primers aliquots protocol ).
So we started our project again, extracting our interest gene, the rh1AB from the P. aeruginosa genome doing a PCR.
