Team:Panama/8 August 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We did an electrophoresis of the miniprep´s products (9/4/11) and PCR´s products (9/5/11).
Trying to probe the primer´s couples, we run a P. aeruginosa genomic DNA´s PCR with the following primer´s combinations:
• RhTf1b+RhT2b
• RhTR2a+RhTf1a
• RhTBiof1b+RhTBio2b
• RhTbioR2a+RhTbiof1a

Volume of master mix: 12.5 uL
Volume of DNA: 2 uL
Volume of Primers: 2.5 uL everyone
Volume of H2O: 6.5 uL
Total Volume of reaction: 26 uL
The most efficient primers were: RhTf1b+RhT2b and RhTbiof1b+RhTbio2b
