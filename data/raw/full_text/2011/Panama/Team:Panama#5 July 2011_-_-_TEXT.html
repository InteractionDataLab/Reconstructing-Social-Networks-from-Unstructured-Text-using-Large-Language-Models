Team:Panama/5 July 2011
From 2011.igem.org
July 5, 2011
We did:
1. Enzimatic digestion using digestion protocol . We made digestion of the 3 parts of the platform of expression (promotor + Rbs, RhlAB) and messenger + terminator) with their each respective plasmid. We used different restriction enzymes for each part.
2. Also we did digestion of the plasmid used for the RhlAB gen that in this case is Psblc3, using Xba1 enzyme.
3. Incubate it for 3 hours at 37º C.
4. Enzymes were deactivated and put in cold to a later electrphoresis.
