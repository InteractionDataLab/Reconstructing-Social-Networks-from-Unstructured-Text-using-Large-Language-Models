Team:Panama/1 June 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We did the transformation of P+R and G+T with negative controls.
Transformation protocol material: Ice, PCR tubes, EPP tubes, Thermocycler,SOC medium,Micropipette peaks
For the process of transformation we used the IGEM protocol. We prepared LB medium + agar and inoculate bacteria on petri dishes.
Negative control (C-) don’t have to grow because doesn’t have the resistance plasmid for ampicillin the antibiotic that we use. The petri dishes have 0.2 µl of Amp.
We check those petri dishes in the evening and growth it well but negative control grows too, therefore, have to do the transformation again. We think that the reason maybe LB medium has contaminate because wasn’t autoclaving.
