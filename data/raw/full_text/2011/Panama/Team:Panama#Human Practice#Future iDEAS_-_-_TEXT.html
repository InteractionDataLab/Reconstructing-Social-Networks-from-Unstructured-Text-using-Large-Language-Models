Human Practice - Future iDEAS
This year we were getting the perception of people, for next year we will strongly work in Human Practice.
For example we want to include high school students on our proyect.
Make more presentation in the most quantity of High School as possible, but not only for making presentations if not by improving Art.
Also something very interesting will be to make some dinamic editions about iGEM, Synthetic Biology and our Proyect for Newspaper...
and a lot of new thing!
Right now we have standarized a biobrick that will serve to biosynthesise rhamnolipid which we plan to use together with other biobricks that will degrade hydrocarbons as well.
The idea is that we will be able to create a Hydrocarbon degrading Biokit that will consist of two phases. one will be the phase in which rhamnolipid will be mass produced in
fermentation batches to be later extracted and used  in contamination sites. The second phase would act directly on the contamination site by biodegrading the hydrocarbons
that remain. Also evolving the concept of using a rhamnose biosynthesising biobrick not only as a rhamnose source for our rhamnolipid biobrick, but also as a substance that can be used for many different concepts including a system that will promote the overexpression of genes.
