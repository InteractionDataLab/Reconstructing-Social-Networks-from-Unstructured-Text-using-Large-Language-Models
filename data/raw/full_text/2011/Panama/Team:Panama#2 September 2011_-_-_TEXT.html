Team:Panama/2 September 2011
From 2011.igem.org
Now that we know that the cloranfenicol is expired, we asked for more so we did another transformation with the TU DELFT Bricks. The biobricks growth but in a monocape, not as individual colonies. Another possible issue is that the agar that we are using is 12 years old and broughts very easily.
Mean while, some team members were at the Balboa Academy doing a presentation about Synthetic Biology and how to form and iGEM team. They were very exciting about this and the School director and profesors are now encharged of forming this new High School Panama team for next year!
