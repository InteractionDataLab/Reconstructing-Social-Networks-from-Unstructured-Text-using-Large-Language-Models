Human Practice - Biology Students´s Perception
In general most of students answered they know very little about What is Synthetic Biology, now we know this we as iGEMers pioners in Panama of Synthetic Biology have the responsability of letting not only students but also people of what is Synthetic Biology.
Of the total of students surveyed once we asked them what meaning they think about Synthetic Biology we got that the think is creating artificial life, but once we divided into levels (academic year) we got that students begining the career they are the most who think Synthetic Biology means this. But once we asked students from second year most of them though Synthetic Biology is a Biological Engineering and students from high levels strangely though as the one from basic levels, that Synthetic Biology is Creating articial life...
Now we will compare three differents questions, most of students surveyed though that by modifying the genome of a bacteria for the benefit of mankind is a risk, but also most of them though that by modifying organisms is a way of promoting natural resources.....and more contradictory is that they think is positive but that also can get out of control.....
