Team:Panama/14 July 2011
From 2011.igem.org
July 14, 2011
We did:
1. Use nanodrop to measure concentrations of yesterday miniprep. We obtained questionable results because concentrationsdo not follow the expected pattern with 260/280.
2. PCR of samples 5, 7 and 8 of it.
Results:
With internal primers - bands of 700 and unspecific bands.
With external primers - high wight bands (2000), very weak bands, unspecific bands.
