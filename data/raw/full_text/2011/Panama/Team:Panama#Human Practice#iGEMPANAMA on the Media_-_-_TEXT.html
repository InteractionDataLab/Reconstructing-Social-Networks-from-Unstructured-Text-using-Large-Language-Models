Human Practice - iGEMPANAMA on the Media
This year we had the oportunity of being on some media in Panama, like Radio this one was on personal interviewed and also over the phone in one case for a province. And some Newspapers like La Prensa , La Estrella and El Semanario which is a internal newspaper from the University of Panama. We are very gratefuly with all of them who give us an space...Thanks!
In this picture we can see, how on the journalist got the main concept and create by her own this steps of our project. This is very good for us and it show how people is getting the main idea of what we do in Synthetic Biology and iGEM.
