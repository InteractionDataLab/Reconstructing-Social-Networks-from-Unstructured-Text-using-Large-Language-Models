Notebook - June 2011
June 29, 2011
We did a lot of work today like:
1. The miniprep of the strains containing the BioBrick rh1AB.
2. An electrophoresis in agarose gel at 1.5% in wich we observed the plasmidic DNA.
3. Mean while some of us picked colonies with P+RBS and the GFP+Ter and transferred it to LB medium.
4. Last attempt to inoculate the E. coli containing the rh1AB mutated from 2/3/11 in LB medium but it didn´t grow again! =(. This time we putted the exact concentration of cloranfenicol  (33 ug/ml).
5. We did all the necessary calculations for the antibiotics concentrations.
Rh1AB + psB1C3 Ectroforesis
