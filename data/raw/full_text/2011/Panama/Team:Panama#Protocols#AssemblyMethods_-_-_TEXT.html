Assembly Method
How we design and build our BioBrick parts?
Rational Design
We need to build using the Assembly Standard Protocol 10 an expression platform that works into our modified E.coli. For this, we choose four standardized biological parts from the Registry, those parts are: Promoter T7, Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS), GFP Reporter and Terminator; Were selected using rational design abstraction from molecular biology and genetic engineering to enable us to build up rationally-engineered, our expression platform.
We ligate the BioBrick parts using the 3A Assembly method
