Human Practice - Overview
Because Synthetic Biology is too complex for some people who are not related with science and making them understand it is not easy at all. We took advantage of the FEEDBACK that does exist between Synthetic Biology and Basic Science to teach people (in our case, Students) about this topic and how iGEM is participating in this revolution.
This year iGEM Panama activities for Human Practices, were based in a simple diffusion information and proximity with society of what is Science, followed by topics more complex like Synthetic Biology, Bioethics, Biosafety, our project and some examples of projects from others teams. To accomplishing this goal, we went to some high schools with the purpose of showing students what is iGEM, How did we get into this International Competition, and then, before explaining them about Synthetic Biology and our project, we needed to teach basic terms what we called Basic Science.  In order to have some information about perception of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, we made small survey that was applied to Biology´s students. Results were interesting.
