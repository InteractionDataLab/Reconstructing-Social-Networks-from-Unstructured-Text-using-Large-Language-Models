History

The Team
We are descendants from a place that emerged from a very slow geological process from millions  of years ago. Results that still impact the world. This place is called PANAMA. A place where history can be divided into many chapters. Beginning with the linking of North and South America, enabling the exchange of species from both locations, making evolution possible to make use of this place as a huge laboratory. Years later in our history this became one of the scenarios for pirates looking for gold in the new world. This earth that links the world, owns one of the greatest engineering milestones, The Panama Canal , and now the expansion of it is without precedent. We as young scientist are part of the enterprise involving genetic engineering through the iGEM competition. Now Panama has two great engineering projects, one is the expansion of the Panama canal as a macro engineering project and our project as micro and nano scale engineering. This makes us pioneers in this field in our country.
This year our team is composed by students from the University of Panama , Latina University of Panama and one student from Technological University of Panama . All of us studying different careers such as Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry and Engineering. Also is very important to mention that we do have new members on the team this year, and also that we had participated in someway of the creation of the new team from Panama which is the UTP-PANAMA . Good wishes for them...
We were advised by several Academics representants. They all did an amazing job of providing us a positive feedback. That´s why we are very grateful with all of them.
We can not forget to acknowledge to Lorena Coronado, Carolina de la Guardia (members of the Team on 2010), Oris Sanjur, Nidia Sandoval, Carlos Ramos. But also we need to give a special THANKS to Marla Ramos, Carmenza Spadafora AND PATRICK NEE YOU RULE!!!

I obtained my doctoral degree in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in Spain. After living in beautiful Andalucía I moved to Florida for my first postdoc position and then moved on to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the Washington, DC area for a much longer second postdoctoral position. I moved back to my country two years ago and when SENACYT asked for my institution, INDICASAT , to help the team, I was asked if I could take charge of the team work in our lab. It has been great to see the independent thinking, great enthusiasm, and pride the students have shown facing the fact that they will be making it possible for our country, Panama, to be in the iGEM contest for the first time in our incipient scientific history

I obtained a doctoral degree in Cell and Developmental Biology from Rutgers University, New Jersey. After I got my degree, I returned to my home country Panama, for a two-year postdoct at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) , using molecular tools to infer relationship among domesticated and wild squashes. In 2000, I accepted a position at STRI as Manager of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Evolution. Recently, I was appointed Associate Director for Science Administration at STRI. I got involved with iGEM when I was invited by SENACYT to participate as one of the instructors for the Panama team. It has been a wonderful experience to have the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with a group of very bright and enthusiastic Panamanian students that have embrace the challenge of representing Panama in the iGEM contest.

e-mail: nanagope@gmail.com
Hobbies: read books, papers, write about general things that happened in life and that pass through my mind, play guitar, sing, play tennis, spend time with my family and messing around with friends and finally, one of the most important things for me, be absorbed in my own thoughts.
iGEM expectations: This is a great step for doing something for the humanity. The entire world could change for good thanks to the synthetic biology. The power is in our hands, let`s do better things for the future. Research interests: I am extremely interested in conducting research in order to contribute to the knowledge and development of humanity in the scientific field. Since I was a child, my passion has been to study animal behavior. However, since I joined to study biology, the ecology and the environmental biology has been very important to me primarily because we are living a crucial moment for the world as global warming. Now I see more clearly that the synthetic biology is a good new increasing field to combat this and one good example is what we are doing in our proyect of rhamnolipids. I have many questions, there are now many aspects of biology that I like to investigate. I am looking for many answers. To go deeper and deeper into the wonderful world of the study of life, I reaffirm the maxim of Socrates, "I only know that I know nothing", and that gives me more thirsty of wanting to know.

Ernesto Gómez
Ernesto
Name: Ernesto Bolivar Gómez Pérez
Age: 24
Degree: Microbiology Undergraduate student
Institution: Universidad de Panama, Smithsonian Tropical Reasearch Institute intern
e-mail: ernestopro@hotmail.com
Hobbies: Think, learn about life, fungus growing ants biology, read about phylosophy, history, science and sci-fi, listen music (playing guitar, drums, sing, specially rock music), write, I like to hear and talk with my parents and old people, I love to work in the lab and outdoor lab, sleep is the greatest pleasure, persue of happiness.
The iGEM Experience: One of the best scientific experience that I have had. I feel that I am part of something huge in terms of scientific development. I am learning a lot from the instructors, advisors and my colleagues in the lab respect to biotechnology. As a biology student am trying to understand life through evolution and how life works in his multiple forms. With the iGEM experience I am starting to see life with another perspective under the umbrella of synthetic biology, that is trying to figure it out how to  desing and modify biological systems into a standard way. Richard Feynman said ‘What I cannot create, I do not understand.’  this became one of the slogans of us, as biological engineering. Now I have a better way to understand life with the synergy between Biology  and engineered. The iGEM program made me a pioneer in this new scientific discipline in my country and I really want to keep working in this field.
Research Interests: Life understanding through evolution is my passion. I am an undergraduate student in Biology oriented in microbiology. I have been working those few years with the biology of the fungus growing ants as intern in the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Here in the department of behavior and evolution I start my travel into scientific research, studying how ants interact with microorganisms, how ants work against diseases, evolution of profilactic behaviors in the fungus growing ants, simbiosis, antagonism, co-evolution, bacterias, fungus, antibiotics, ecology are terms with that I have been familiarized. The development of engineered biology became one of my interest when I was studying microbial genetics, the manipulation of DNA brings to us a full knowledge of how life works and I am really interested to be involved of this kind of investigations.  Now with iGEM, the Synthetic Biology appears to me as one step further of biology engineering and I am doing a complete diving in biotechnology techniques with the aim to learn how to design and modify biological systems. I will keep studying and working in this field because it leads us to the full application of biology as a substance.
