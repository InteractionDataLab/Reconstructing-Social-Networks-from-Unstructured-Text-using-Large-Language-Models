IPTG inducible Expression Platform
We take advances in genetic engineering as synthetic biology, as viable solution to oil pollution cleanup. But for do this; we need to design and build an expression platform that works into our modified E.coli. For this, We choose four standardized biological parts from the Registry, those parts are: IPTG inducible promoter, Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS), GFP Reporter and Double Terminator; Were selected using rationale from molecular biology and genetic engineering to enable us to build up rationally-engineered, our expression platform.
For the iGEM 2011, we will integrate and assembly those parts (P+RBS+GFP+T) along with our BioBrick part using the 3A Assembly Method, to bring up an expression device (P+RBS+rhlAB_BB+GFP+T) for rhamnolipid production in E. coli.
