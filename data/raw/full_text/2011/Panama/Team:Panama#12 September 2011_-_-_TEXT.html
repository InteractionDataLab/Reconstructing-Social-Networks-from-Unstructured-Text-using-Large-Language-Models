Team:Panama/12 September 2011
From 2011.igem.org
Results: Which Cell is competent? A= E. coli k-12 and E. coli JM109 (MgCl2) Which strain has chloramphenicol's resistance? A= E. coli k-12 and E. coli JM109 have chloramphenicol's resistance Which strain has ampicilin's resistance? A= No one! E. coli JM109+inducible promoter(with ampicilin's resistance)+LB chloramphenicol: grew! (E. coli JM109 has chloramphenicol's resistance). We inoculate LB-chloramphenicol liquid media (everything that grew!)  We did a cloning with rh1AB and pGEM-T (pGEM T-easy and pGEM-T Cloning Kit)
