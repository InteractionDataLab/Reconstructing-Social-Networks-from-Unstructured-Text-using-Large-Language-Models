Team:Panama/9 September 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We prepared 5 mL of chloramphenicol and 5 mL of ampicilin, the chloramphenicol was stored on -20 centigrades and the ampicilin was stored on 4 centigrades. We prepared 14 petri dishes with LB media, 11 petri dishes with ampicilin and 3 petri dishes with chloramphenicol. We inoculate 2 petri dishes and a negative control, with the inducible promoter, but with three different E. coli's strains: E. coli K-12, E. coli JM109 (competent with CaCl2) and E. coli JM109 (competent with MgCl2).\ Also, we inoculate  2 petri dishes with E. coli k-12 and E. coli JM109 competent cells, without transformation, (trying to probe if someone of these strains have ampicilin's resistance). We inoculate another three petri dishes with E. coli k-12, and E. coli JM109, without transformation, (trying to probe if someone of these strains have ampicilin's resistance, and in the third petri dish we inoculate the inducible promoter. The objectives of the day are: Which cell is competent? Which strain has ampicilin or chloramphenicol's resistance, without transformation? Do the chloramphenicol works?
