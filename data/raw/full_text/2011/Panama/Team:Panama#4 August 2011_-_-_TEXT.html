Team:Panama/4 August 2011
From 2011.igem.org
A small group of Panama iGEM Team went to a presentation on Moscote´s High School
We run a PCR using Roche´s master mix (template. P. aeruginosa genomic DNA) we hadn´t any results at all.
We did Biobrick´s minipreps and other one for the Inducible, and Constitutive Promoters.
