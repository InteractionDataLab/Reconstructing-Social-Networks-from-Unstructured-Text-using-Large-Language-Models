GFP reporter plus Double Terminator
The iGEM Team Panama 2011 have to design and assemble the ends of an expression platform in order to bring up by rational designing a fuctional test platform for the expression of our Team favorite BioBrick part BBa_K653000 A.K. The Biosurfactator.
We choose to assembly two existing BioBrick parts from the shop, we mean The Registry. Those parts are: a GFP reporter BBa_E0040 and a double terminator BBa_B0015. We assemble them to bring up a new composite part that will serve as a well characterized ends for a expression platform for several coding sequences like our RhlAB_BBa_K653000
