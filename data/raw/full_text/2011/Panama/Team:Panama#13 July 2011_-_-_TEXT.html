Team:Panama/13 July 2011
From 2011.igem.org
July 13, 2011
We did:
1. Electrophoresis of the products of yesterday PCR and 3 digestions.
What we expect to know? If EcoR1 enzyme digest and in how much microliters is efficient, that with dilution the amplification be more effective.
Results: We had not results of PCR :( !
Apparently EcoR1 enzyme cut the plasmid, we see bands of approximately 2 kb and others of 1,2 kb. We think that the gen isn't in the plasmid because the weight desired es of 4,4 kb (4,441pb)
We have to do electrophoresis again for:
-Check if primers weren't degraded, Results: There aren't
-If gen is mutated:
Good news: Sample 6 of 10/30/11- mutated gen!
Bad news: rh1AB + psB1C3 of 10/30/11 isn't observed. We take DNA of this sample for transformation and because of that we had questionable results.
