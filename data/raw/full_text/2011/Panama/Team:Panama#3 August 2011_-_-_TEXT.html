Team:Panama/3 August 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We repeated the PCR of the Biobrick using other master mix, with the miniprep´s products obtained from the Biobrick ordered at MIT.
We prepared a chloramphenicol stock (50mg/mL), which was stored at -20 °C.
Primers used for PCR:
• RhT2b+RhT2a
• RhTbio2a+RhTbio2b
• RhTbioF1b+RhTbioF1a
• RhT1a+RhT1b
Program used for PCR:

We aliquoted Primers again (work solutions).
We did an electrophoresis of the PCR´s products on an agarose gel 1% TAE 1X (We hadn´t any results).
PCR (Probing primer´s effectiveness with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa´s genomic DNA)

Volume of master mix: 12.5 uL
Volume of DNA: 5 uL
Volume of Primers: 2.5 uL to everyone
Volume of H2O: 5.5 uL
Total Volume of reaction: 28 uL
We hadn´t any results, we realized that Taq Pol wasn´t capable of polymerize fragments most heavy than 1000 bp.
