Team:Panama/22 July 2011
From 2011.igem.org
We take a sample of rh1AB purifying gen without mutation and doing a PCR because doesn’t have a lot and we have to digest with Pst1. On Monday we are going to do a mutagenesis.
We use the PCR protocol that functions well with our gene ( PCR Protocol ) and we test all primers because we don’t know which primers the team used the last year for genes amplification.

Primers:
1. F:RhTf2a R:RhTR2a
2. F:RhT-f1b R:RhT-2b
3. F:RhTBio-R2a R:RhTBio-F1a
4. F:RhTBio-f1 R:RhTBio-2b
Meanwhile Orlando and Paul make the miniprep of (RBS + P) and (GFP + T) using the protocol of dirty miniprep on page 80.Right Now Sergio and Natasha take the miniprep results and check the concentration with Nanodrop while Paul prepares PCR.
RESULTS:

We have good levels of absorbance and concentration in the samples, we hope that the electrophoresis be good.

In sample #5 observe that the gene has a slightly amplification. Check pag 108 and 109 with Lorena because someone changes the PCR program. The gene doesn’t show any amplification. We have to make a PCR of the miniprep samples of the parts.
