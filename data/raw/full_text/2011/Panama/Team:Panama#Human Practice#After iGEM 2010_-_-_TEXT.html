Human Practice - After iGEM 2010
After iGEM 2010
Once we returned to our country Panama after the iGEM competition on 2010 with a Bronze Medal in our first time participation in this competition, we were congratulated not only by all the members of the team, advisors, sponsors and relatives, if not by all the people who by different media knew about our involvement and achievement through this competition.
Once back, we had massive interviews in differents media, as televisión, radio, newspaper and websites. We take advantage of this opportunity to discuss not only about the pioneer acheivement that we earn, but also that through the media we were able to be closer to people all over our country and talk to them about iGEM competition experience, Synthetic Biology and our proyect.
Even if it was not easy to explain about this in the short time period given in each of the different media, we used the most that time we were able to explain the important for us about being in a competition like is this, the meaning of this competition and our goals.
These are some of the different interviews:
