June 19
Collection of soil and water samples from LA River
June 20

Setting up lab, stock supplies, preparation of LB-amp plates
Test extraction of DNA from BioBrick wells into cloning plates ( K123000 , K123001 , K123002 , K123003 )
Initial enrichment cultures of collected samples on minimal media with BPA or 17a-ethynylestradiol
June 21

June 23
Transformation of T7 polymerase ( K145001 ), mCherry ( J06702 ]), Lac Promoter ( R0010 ]), and double terminator ( B0014 and B0015 ) biobricks for test sequences for BisA and BisB degradation genes ( K123000 and K123001 )
Retested competent cells made June 22nd with K123001 and pUC
Transfered 0.5 mL aliquots of BPA and 5mL 17a-ethynylestradiol cultures from June 20 to new tubes of minimal media
Designed primers for test sequence of BisdA (pNT001)
Designed primers to continue sequencing of human ER ( K123003 )
We determined that sequences for K123000 and K123001 have correct protein coding but different codons than in the sequences shown online
June 24
Transformation of Tet repressible promoter R0040
Preparation of LB, LB (no antibiotic) plates, and SOC media
Transfer of 5 mL DDT and nonylphenol cultures from June 21 to new tubes of minimal media
Design of reverse primer for continued sequencing of human ER ( K123003 )
Update Wiki with protocols we have been using
We determined that our competent cells are functional have a cfu/ug DNA of 6.6 x 10^6.
June 25
Take out plates from June 24
