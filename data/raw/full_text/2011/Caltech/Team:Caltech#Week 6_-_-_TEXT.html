July 18
Colonies 1-6 from Gibson plates; 7 and 8 are reswabs of two colonies. From left to right: DNA ladder,(PNT001; colony 1; vector), P2v, P3v, P4v, P5v, P6v, P7v, P8v, (PNT001; colony 1; insert), P3i, P4i, P5i, P6i
from left to right: DNA ladder, (PNT001; reswab 7; insert), P8i, (16s; colony A; vector), 16Bv, 16Cv, (16s; A; insert), 16Bi, 16Ci
Colony PCR of colonies from positive Gibson plates from Friday, for vector and insert
Colony PCR of 16s plasmids, for vector and insert
Gel of short PCR parts to confirm they are being amplified
Pulsed field gel with a larger amount of soil sample DNA
Retransform pSB3K5 into Xl-10s
Results
Gels show mostly expected single bands

PCR parts for Gibson assembly of pNT001, pNT003 and Joe's positive GFP control
Results
pSB3K5 plate had 0 colonies.
PFGE of soil-extracted DNA shows a smear; will do gel extraction of ~40kbp sequences for fosmid kit.

Pulse field gel of soil-extracted DNA, in preparation for fosmid insertion
PCR parts for Gibson assembly of pNT001, pNT003 and positive control
Redo Gibson assembly of pNT001 using a smaller total mass of DNA. Gibson assemble GFP from Joe that is known to have worked before as a positive control
Try transforming pSB3K5 with less DNA and as a liquid culture
Prepare minimal media plates with chemical layer

Minimal media plates:  BPA and DDT plates came out wrong.  Will plate DDT cultures anyway and redo.

Gel extraction of 40kb LA River sample DNA from pulse field gel
Transform pSB3K3 into competent cells, since the pSB3K5 transform is not working
Run Gibson assembly of Joe's GFP and pNT001 and stop at different time points. Run on a gel to see what size DNA there is at different times in the reaction
Try "step-wise" Gibson. Add the insert for pNT001 (3 ul) into a 10 ul reaction and incubate at 50˚C for 10 or 20 minutes before adding to a premade Gibson mix of just the vector (2 ul). Continue incubating until a total of 1 hour has passed. This may help with the self-ligation of the vector by giving the insert time to assemble if it works

Gave a presentation of our project so far to Dr. Murray's bio subgroup.
Sent off pNT001 and GFP Gibson colonies for sequencing.

PCR of the pNT001 insert was successful. The bright band around 700 bp is the correct length for the insert.
July 23
Results
Sequencing results are back. pNT001 sample 1 was the only one with a good alignment. Blasted both GFP colonies and they contained vector only.
PFGE-extracted DNA concentrated by evaporation centrifuging; nanodrop results: 9-1: 11.4ng/uL; 10-2: 29.7ng/uL
