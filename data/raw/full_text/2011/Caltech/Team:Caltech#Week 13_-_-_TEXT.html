September 4
Overnights of: K123001 (bisdB) x2, pNT001 (construct vector) x2, and pSB3k3(BioBrick submission vector) x3
September 5
Miniprepped overnights of K123001, pNT001, and pSB3k3
PCR assembly of K123001 with prefix-promoter and terminator-suffix ultrimers to make bisdB construct

September 6
Assembly of bisdB pcr'ed construct into pNT001 (with bisdA) and pSB3k3 (BioBrick submission vector, with unwanted RFP)
Plate all assembled & transformed constructs and controls
Grow overnights of J23119-lacZ-MG-1655 from two different plate sources and one glycerol stock
September 7
Plated the rest of transformed pSB3k3-bisdB
Add the J23119-lacZ-MG-1655 to autoclaved LB+glass beads to incubate biofilm at 37&degC
Performed qualitative X-gal experiment to pick best J23119-lacZ-MG-1655 overnight (turned most blue in least time)
Restreak pNT001-bisdB colonies onto another plate for clearer single colonies
