Nanodrop conc. (ng/uL)
WT-F87A
118
September 13
Overexpression of his-tagged DDT-dechlorinase in pET protein expression vector in preparation for purification, at 20&degC and 37&degC
Quikchange of Wt-F87A with newly miniprepped DNA
Plates of results, + the rest of SOC
September 14
Protein purification of DDT-dechlorinase using Sigma-aldrich his-select protein purification columns
SDS gradient gel of purified products, as well as pellet, first flow-through, and first wash
Results
No visible colonies on plates
September 15
Finish staining SDS gel
Retransform quikchange pcr products
Make and autoclave M9 solution
Set up biofilm experiments using different substrates (glass beads vs. wood chips), media (dilute LB vs. M9), and conditions (20&degC vs. 37&deg C vs. shaking)
Results
Purified DDT dechlorinase band visible, size according to BioRad broad range protein marker
September 16
Made desalting buffer (20mM Tris-HCl + 150mM NaCl)
Desalt DDT-dechlorinase buffer of imidazole to stabilize protein through dialysis
Made X-gal-IPTG plates for quikchange lacZ repair control
