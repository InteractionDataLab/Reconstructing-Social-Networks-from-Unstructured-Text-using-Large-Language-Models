Solid carbon is provided as a surface for bacteria to grow on as water flows through the tank. Contact time is 15 minutes, and the system processes water at 300 gallons per minute. Before injecting back into the source, the water is filtered with Trimite, a gravel and carbon mixture. This process removes VOCs from the source and further dilutes the VOC levels in the groundwater.

Groundwater flows from JPL toward Monk Hill, and according to the plant, the contamination plume is spreading. However, as a Superfund Site, NASA and the EPA work on cleaning at the source of pollution, injecting clean water back into the groundwater to dilute contaminants and reduce risk of spreading. The influent at Monk Hill is still considered extremely impaired.
</P><P>Monk Hill has 4 wells on site between 550 and 700 feet deep that draw from the Arroyo Seco groundwater and surface water. Since they were installed beginning in 1924, part of the development of the Monk Hill plant involved rehabilitating the wells by adding a new lining and packing gravel in the space between the linings to prevent infiltration.
</P><P>Influent from the wells goes to a settling tank to remove most particulates before further treatment. This is a standard process and helps clean the water and protect the downstream infrastructure.
</P><P>There are 4 pairs of ion-exchange tanks that remove perchlorate. They are filled with beads of resin, which feel slippery to the touch. The tank is much like a large column: influent comes in at the top and gravity draws the water through the packed resin. Then the effluent from one tank is used as influent for a second ion-exchange tank, in a lead-lag configuration. Levels of perchlorate can be checked at different heights along the tank through outlet valves.
</P><P>When the resin reaches max perchlorate capacity, it must be replaced. During resin replacement, tanks are inspected for integrity and disinfected with sodium bicarbonate. Once resin beads are added, the tank is backwashed to remove air and stratify the beads.
</P><P>The water then goes through 5 pairs of granular activated carbon (GAC) tanks. These have large particles at the top and smaller ones at the bottom of the tank. Water goes through the tank from top to bottom, and the GAC removes VOCs.
</P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:722px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Water treatment flow at Monk Hill Water Treatment Plant turning extremely impaired groundwater into drinking water for the city of Pasadena.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>The Monk Hill tank system can treat 7000 gallons per minute maximally. When the iGEM team visited, only one well was operational and 2200 gallons per minute were being treated. The facility is proud of the nearly silent treatment process, as they are located in a largely residential area.
</P><P>Treated water then is injected with chlorine gas from 150 lb. cylinders to disinfect it. Up to 250 lbs. can be injected per day, so at peak operation, tanks have to be replaced every 4 to 5 days. Ammonia is added afterwards to create chloramines, as the level of free chlorine gas is strictly regulated for health reasons. The facility has alarms that close the area and alert the fire department at 1 ppm and 3 ppm.
</P><P>Treated water from all active wells is mixed in the covered Windsor Reservoir, which can hold 4.8 million gallons. This water is then used as drinking water in the city of Pasadena and is cheaper than imported water from <A href="http://www.mwdh2o.com/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD).</A></P><TABLE class="gallery" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="gallerybox" style="width: 155px;"><DIV class="gallerytext"><P>Ion-exchange and GAC tanks

San Jose Creek uses activated sludge with three zones: aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic, although some air is added to anaerobic to keep turbidity high enough so that the microbes can access nutrients. Small solids can disturb the turbidity: the little beads in hand sanitizer once caused a problem.
</P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">The San Jose Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant run by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County keeps the smell of sewage so low that people are surprised to learn there is a wastewater treatment plant so close to them.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Each wastewater treatment plant has its own unique microbiological ecology due to selection pressures from influent sewage. Outside bacteria, protists and fungi can upset the local ecology, potentially creating a septic situation where the waste is not treated. Yeast from a bakery once killed many of the microbes due to its high oxygen demand. However, if a plantâs microbes are wiped out, it can be reseeded using another plantâs microbes. Eventually, the microbial population will return to the same diversity as before. In the event of a plant shutdown, the sewage can be sent downstream to JWPCP and other plants for treatment. 
</P><P>After going through the microbial tanks, the water is held in a settling tank to remove and recover the activated sludge. Some of the activated sludge is sent to JWPCP as waste and the rest is returned to the microbial tanks.
</P><P>Tertiary treatment begins by gravity filtering the water through sand and gravel. The filter has to be changed once per year. If the plant wanted to remove ammonia, they could have a zeolite filter, but San Jose Creek uses a nitrification-denitrification process so the ammonia and then chlorine are injected for disinfection. Sulfur dioxide is added and then the water is ready for reuse as irrigation. Chlorine is removed before discharge into the environment. The recycled water is not approved for drinking because there could be something that cannot be measured or is not measured because it is not known to be a hazard.
</P><P>San Jose Creek processes 100 million gallons of water per day. Water goes through the plant in 8 to 10 hours. Recycled water is sold at 1/3 the price of well water. <A href="http://www.lacsd.org/info/energyrecovery/landfillgastoenergy/puentehillsgastoenergy.asp" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Methane captured by the nearby landfill</A> also run by the Sanitation District is used to power the plant.

Laws currently prohibit reclaimed wastewater from being directly sold as drinking water. Instead, the water must be discharged into nature, and those that pump from nature will treat it and sell it as drinking water.
<P>The plantâs influent is secondary treated wastewater from Hyperion Water Treatment Plant that would normally be discharged into the ocean. The water is split into two types of tertiary treatment: settling tanks with chlorine injected, and microfiltration with UV disinfection.
</P><P>The 25 feet-deep settling tanks are injected with ferric chloride to coagulate solids, giving the tanks a red coloring. Then the water is chlorinated and dechlorinated, as West Basin sells this quality of water for irrigation, processing 10 million gallons per day. Compared to the newer method of microfiltration, standard tertiary treatment takes more space and chemicals.

RO membranes used to be made of cellulose acetate, but now are made of polyamic membrane, which can withstand higher pressures and has better rejection of contaminants, but is not resistant to chlorine. The membrane flux is 12 gallons per square foot per day, with water being pushed through using 160 lbs. of pressure. 85% of the water is recovered. The rest is lost in brine, the concentrated salts and chemicals discharged into the ocean as waste. Depending on the quality needed by the customer, the water may be treated twice with reverse osmosis.</P><P>The water is then sterilized using UV.
