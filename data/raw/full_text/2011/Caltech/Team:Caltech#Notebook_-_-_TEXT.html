Methods and Protocols
Week 1 : 6/15-6/17: Lab orientation
Week 2 : 6/19-6/25: Lab training; sample collection, enrichment cultures, DNA extraction from samples
Week 3 : 6/26-7/2: Prepare parts by PCR for Gibson assembly of test plasmids of BisdA and BisdB, continue enrichment cultures
Week 4 : 7/3-7/10: Sequencing and testing of Gibson assembled vectors
Week 5 : 7/11-7/16: Remake Gibson vectors, begin 16S sequencing, run pulsed field gel to extract degradation genes for fosmid kit
Week 6 : 7/17-7/23: Continuation of Gibson assembly, 16s sequencing and assembly, and fosmid kit
Week 7 : 7/24-7/30: p450 testing, plating of EDC's, more assembly
Week 8 : 7/31-8/6: Titering of fosmid kits, HPLC of p450 degradation, more assembly and EDC plating
Week 9 : 8/7-8/13 GCMS attempts at p450-degraded BPA, biofilm/crystal violet experiments, assembly of constructs and DDT gene
Week 10 : 8/14-8/20: Electrospray of p450-degraded BPA; visits to local water treatment plants; assembly of constructs, lacZ, and DDT gene
Week 11 : 8/21-8/27: Assembly of DDT-degradation gene and p450 into BioBrick submission and pET protein expression vectors
Week 12 : 8/28-9/3: Biofilm-X-gal experiments, sequencing, HPLC
Week 13 : 9/4-9/10: Quikchange, Biobrick, sequencing
Week 14 : 9/12-9/18: Redo Quikchange, Biofilm, Protein Expression, HPLC
Week 15 : 9/19-9/23: Submit parts to registry: DDT gene, bisdA & bisdB, Wt-F87A
