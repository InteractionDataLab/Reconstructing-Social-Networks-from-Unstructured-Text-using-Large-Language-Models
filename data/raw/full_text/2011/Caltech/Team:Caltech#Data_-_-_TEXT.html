Data For Our New Parts
Main Page - DDT Dehydrochlorinase, BBa_K620000: Enzyme capable of degrading DDT
Main Page - WT-F87A (p450), BBa_K620001: Cytochrome p450 capable of degrading Bisphenol A
Main Page - LacI promoter + BisdA, BBa_K620002: The gene for BisdA, one of a pair of proteins capable of degrading BPA, in front of the LacI promoter
Main Page - Tet promoter + BisdB, BBa_K620003: The gene for BisdB, one of a pair of proteins capable of degrading BPA, in front of the Tet promoter
Data For Pre-Existing Parts
Experience - BisdA, BBa_K123000: It appears the team codon optimized the part as the amino acid sequence is correct, but the DNA sequence differs. We sequenced the part.
Experience - BisdB, BBa_K123001: It appears the team codon optimized the part as the amino acid sequence is correct, but the DNA sequence differs. We sequenced the part.
Experience - ER (Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha), BBa_K123003: It appears the team codon optimized the part as the amino acid sequence is correct, but the DNA sequence differs. We sequenced the part.
