Biobrick Assembly Restriction Digest
For a double digest:
1. To a pcr tube, add 10 ul of miniprepped plasmid or purified PCR product
2. Also add 6 ul H2O.
3. Add 2 ul of the appropriate buffer (look at NEB's Restriction Enzyme Activity chart )
4. Add 1ul of each enzyme.
5. Incubate at 37˚C for 1 hour.
6. Add CIP to the backbone digest. Incubate at 37˚C for 1 hour
7. PCR purify the reactions, unless you need to select out your part through gel extraction. Avoid these when possible, but if your insert is coming from a plasmid rather than a PCR, you need to select the insert you want and avoid having any of the leftover backbone in your ligation reaction. Also, you may need to do a triple digest to be able to size select for your insert. Use Geneious to find restriction sites.
Biobrick Assembly Ligation
1. In a PCR tube, add restriction digested and PCR purified insert to backbone in a 3-5:1 molar ratio, usually 1 ul backbone with 2 ul insert works.
2. Add 5.5 ul H20 (or other, so that the total volume of the ligation is 10 ul)
3. Add 1ul T4 ligase buffer
4. Add 0.5 ul T4 ligase
5. Create a negative control replacing the insert with water
6. Add reactions to thermal cycler. Incubate at 22˚C for 30 minutes, at 65˚C for 10 minutes to heat inactivate, and if not being used right away, leave at 4˚C.
7. Use 2 ul of the ligation reactions to transform cells.
Electrocompetent cells
1. Centrifuge 1 mL of the overnight E. coli culture to be transformed.
2. Pour off the supernatant in liquid waste container.
3. Add 1 mL of cold 10% glycerol.
4. Vortex the cells to resuspend them in the cold 10% glycerol.
5. Centrifuge the culture again and go to #2. Repeat 4-5 times. This step washes the cells with cold 10% glycerol to remove the LB.
6. Centrifuge the cells one final time, pour off the supernatant, add 50 microliters of cold 10% glycerol and vortex to resuspend.
7. Let the cells chill on ice for ~30 minutes.
Electroporation
1. Take 1 50ul aliquot of DH5a electrocompetent cells from -80˚C freezer.
2. Add 50 ul COLD 10% glycerol to dilute the cells, as ours are too concentrated. Divide into 2 50ul aliquots
3. Put electrocuvettes in freezer to cool. Keep on ice at all times before shocking
4. Add 1-2 ul of DNA (depends on source of DNA, use less for plasmids/biobricks, more for ligations etc.) to each 50 ul aliquot of cells.
5. Leave on ice for 2-5 minutes
6. Electroporate at 2.5 kV, 25 uF, 200 ohms by sliding cuvette into the machine and pressing the two buttons until you hear a beep
7. Immediately dilute with 250 ul LB or SOC. 8. Incubate in a shaker at 37˚C for 1 hour. 9. Plate using 50ul, otherwise you might get way too many colonies.
Enrichment cultures
For BPA (since soluble)
1. Set up 16 tubes: 8 tubes with vitamin media vs. 8 tubes with media (no vitamin), 4 tubes for each of the four locations.
2. Place 8 test tubes in 30°C shaker and 8 test tubes in room temperature shaker.
For 17α-estradiol, DDT, and nonylphenol (since non-soluble)
1. Set up two flasks: one with vitamin media, one without vitamin.
2. Add small amounts (around 50mL or 50mg) of the ten LA river samples into each flask.
For both: culture initially for 3 days, then reculture for 7 days. Then test for DNA and continue cultures.

Gibson Assembly (Adapted from Cambridge 2010)
0a. PCR DNA strands (50uL rxn)
0b. DpnI digest and purify products (elute w/ 20-30uL EB or H2O);(Nanodrop)-> normally 50-120ng/nL
1. Mix DNA
2. To 3uL of DNA, add 7.5uL of Gibson Mix
3. Incubate @ 50C for 30-60 minutes with heated lid
4. Cool, then transform into chemically competent cells, or dilute 1:3 and use 1-3 ul of that to transform electrocompetent cells.
