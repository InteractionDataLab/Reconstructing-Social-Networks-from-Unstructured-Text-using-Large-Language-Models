        Since Team sign up time, 6 months have past. Once no one believed we could do this; once no teacher would like to support us; once no qualified synthetic biological lab was available, once no sponsor dare to help a brand new Team that has no brilliant prize history. We throw all the doubt or even smear behind, we tried every effort to persuade professors to give us a chance, we seek every researcher in Qingdao who have experience in synthetic biology for help, we send to hundreds of companies for financial aids. During certain period, our hope was attenuating from huge beam to thinning thread, some one chose to withdrew, some one chose to fight to the end. The turning point of our tough journey is the icebreaking meeting with Researcher Xu, after so many setbacks, we were never prepared to know that Xu would like to provide lab space for us to pursue our dream. This distinguished break-tradition behavior greatly encouraged our morale. More and more teachers might be touched by our spirit, they help us with temporary dormitory, they gives their personal aids, even anonymously. We really cherish this opportunity to be exposed to cutting edge knowledge. We thought that series of whole night work may partially make up for our inexperience and lagging behind, we are fully charged. While so many unexpected things happened, sometimes we just felt that we were playing in a US TV series like 24 hours. Tears, hesitation, lazy frequently appeared during the summer work, persistence is fighting with drying out. We just believe in that no one should be left, no matter what traditional views press on us. On the night before deadline, though we are not quite satisfied with our present progress, there is no sorry left. Great thanks again to all kind-hearted who accompany us all the way around!
