Guiding introduction
        The aim of summer work is to illuminate the ancient Chinese philosophical theory called " Wu Xing ”, also Theory of FIVE Elements, by artificially assembling a unique communication system between bacteria. The theory of five elements was a concept used to explain the composition and phenomena of the physical universe. Between the five elements there exists close relationships that can be classified as mutual promoting and restraining under certain conditions, by which functions of the various systems are coordinated and homeostasis of universe maintained. In our project, five modified nutritionally deficient bacteria represent the five elements in the theory. They can talk to each other by emitting and receiving small specific signal molecules called AHLs. Five pairs of signal receivers, like luxR, and signal producer, like luxI, are involved in achieving the process. Moreover, one will help another in producing the essential nutrition for living while limiting the production of a third member. Through such mechanism, the group will survive and live in moderate coexistence as a whole, just like the effect of the philosophical theory.
Significance
        This project establishes a foundational model of minimum well balanced coexistence between bacteria, which has great ground meaning for future work in many fields. Also, it provides new ideas in the application of synthetic biology: beside practical use, synthetic biology could also “plays drama”, connects ancient Chinese philosophy and modern science and makes a bridge between different cultures.
Distinguishing feature
        The promoting relationship will form a “circle” while the restraining relationship will form a “star”, which only “ the five elements ” theory can make the simplest explanation. It hides many feedback mechanisms which are quite common for keeping balance. This model imitates the complicated relationships existing in nature, while structures of other models like the western ancient outlook -“ Four Elements ”- cannot represent it.
