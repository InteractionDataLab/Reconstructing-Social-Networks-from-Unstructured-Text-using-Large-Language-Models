Integrated balance
        To build a promoting cycle and show Wuxing’s producing and restricting effect more vividly, we need to find a phenotype to display its promoting effect. Compared with other form of deficiency form like antibiotics resistance deficiency, survive-die phenomena is the most suitable and safe way of demonstrating this. Then we think about the amino acid deficient bacteria. Luckily, we found the HB101, which is a leuB and proA deficient bacterium, in Takara’s catalogues.
        We choose the leuB, then cloned it and made a gene complementary experiment between the chromosome and plasmid.
        First, we use the HB101 as the leucine deficient chassis for our device.
Then, we combine the leuB with promoter pLac, RBS and terminator in plasmid, making a device that can produce leuB.
        Next, we transform the plasmid into HB101.
        So, we could see the HB101 can survive in a medium without leucine again.
        Here is some information about HB101: supE44, hsdS20 (rB-mB-) , recA13, ara-14, proA2, lacY1, galK2, rpsL20, xyl-5, mtl-1, leuB6, thi-1
