Though IGEM must be quite familiar to many US students, it’s the first time for us to personally experience the whole process; it’s so worthy and is surely a new watershed and highlight of my college life. Thanks for all my iGEMers and those self-giving friends. I always insist that we should just try it again until we get what we want; I always strike for perfection however tough it is. These beliefs support me to get over all the difficulties and the unexpected. Breathe brand-new atmosphere in iGEM , let’s feel and create new vitality for Synthetic biology !
		I am responsible for the whole organization of the team, designing and operation of summer experiments, mission allocation and handling all kinds of affairs and problems.

		I am Liu Yang, student majoring biochemistry and molecular biology. I am so excited about participating in 2011 iGEM. Here, I want to give my sincere thanks to my team members of OUC_China and teachers who help us selflessly. To many iGEM teams, synthetic biology is an interesting field of biological science; but for us, it’s not just a cutting edge subject, it’s an unforgettable fantasy about dream, dignity and fighting. On the way of seeking, we are afraid of nothing!
		I originally propose the idea of interpreting Theory of five elements by the bacteria. I am also responsible for external networks for our team, including ask help from sponsors, team publicity and art design.

I'm Zhang Jun, an optimistic and enthusiastic girl.  It is my honor to take part in this synthetic biology competition. I like swimming and I'm good at singing. I like the mystique of science, in which the challenge and the sense of achievement during the experiment make me crazy. Despite setbacks, I'll never give up!
I gave presentation for my team at the China meeting up in USTC, I am also responsible for many sections of the experiments, such as those about the deficient bacteria, and part of notebook making.

 Hello, everyone! I'm Zhang Xiaoxi, a Chinese girl. I'm from OUC university. My major is 
ecology. It's an honor to join part in this game, and I really have learned a lot. In my life, I am curious and optimistic. I want to try many unknown things to get excited, including this experience. But sometimes I will be very lazy, sitting on my bed for a whole day. I love smile, my signboard is my smiling face. Look at my! Do you want to be my friend?
I am mainly responsible for searching the previous biobrick parts, drawing gene maps and doing experiments.

I'm Zhang Qian. I'm very straightforward. I don't like hiding my true thoughts. I'll say and do what I think. Music and art are always a part of my life. Although I don't think I’m good at singing and drawing. I like challenging myself. It's my great honor to take part in this synthetic biology competition. Before the competition, I know little about synthetic biology. Maybe it's the first time for me to learn knowledge not in class. It’s my biggest rewarding. However it's difficult, now that I have decided to do it, I’ll never give up. I enjoy the process very much. We are fighting ~O (∩_∩) O~.

Hello, I am Zhou Xuemeng, a girl from China. My major is biochemistry, which give me foundation to attend the competition. It is  a honor to be a member of OUC-CHINA team. The process of competition is hard but full of happiness, and I think the process is more important than result because of our teamwork and hard work. Synthetic biology is interesting and our team is wonderful!

Hi, I’m Yuyan Zhang, a senior student in College of Marine Life Science. My major is Biology. After participating research programs in molecular biology and developmental biology, I found myself interested into exploring the mystery of life codes. Now I am studying as a transfer student in University of Minnesota, Duluth, majoring in Cellular and Molecular Biology, with a minor in Economics. I believe that the new discoveries in life science can not only affect the academia, but can also bring benefits to much more aspects, like social recognition, economic development and health care of the whole human beings. That is the goal of all the iGEM members.

I am Peng Yong and major in ecology coming from School of marine life science of OUC. I am “unique” because I am the youngest iGEMer in our team. Though I haven’t received enough knowledge and experimental training, my computer skills makes sense in the competition. I am in born an adherent for idealism; I love challenges, not a afraid of the indefinites. I feel so lucky to join in this dream-seeking journey. We are the first group in Shandong Province to participate in the game, courage and vigor will never dry up, we will always take them with us until the end.
I am the main designer and constructor for our wiki page, art design is my favorite! 						    </P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
