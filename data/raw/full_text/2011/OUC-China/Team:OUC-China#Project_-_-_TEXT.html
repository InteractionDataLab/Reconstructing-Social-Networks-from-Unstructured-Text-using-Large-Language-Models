Project Overview
Our team wants to combine the communication mechanism in prokaryotes in order to illuminate the coexistence of prokaryotes by Chinese traditional philosophy using “Wuxing”. Several genetically modified cells imitate the five elements in Lao’s view, constitutes “Yuanqi”, in which they promote and inhibit each other. So we can study the coexistence and cooperation of several functional cells in balance. In Lao’s conception, the five fundamental elements have a relationship of supporting and inhibit each other so as to keep the universe stable. It is our hope that through our work cells can survive in such a harmonious manner.
