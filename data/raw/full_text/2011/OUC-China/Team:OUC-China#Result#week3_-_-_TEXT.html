Have a break today~.
7-26
Today we choose four relatively longer parts to do the digestion ,electrophoresis and ligation. Unfortunately, the results of digestion and electrophoresis are both terrible. Some bands disappear, and some others are dim. It’s always difficult to come up to expectations. So we didn’t go on to ligate them. We think it’s because our operations are not so standard. We want to do it again and seek the reasons.
We get some name cards of enzyme company through our teachers. We should clear up the enzymes we need and definite enzyme cut’s steps. We ask our teachers for this question. It’s clear now.
7-27
We verify remaining parts cut yesterday by electrophoresis. And ligate them in the evening.
7-28
Extract the plasmids that were ligated yesterday. For a day, they’re so clean. Obviously, we didn’t ligate them successfully. We make a plan about our future days’ tasks. In the evening, we go on ligating them. And make some square plates and dry them.
7-29
At 4: oo a.m, we transform four new parts and coat the four and two ligated parts on square plate. In the morning, we make up some medium and disinfect them. In the evening, we find the mediums don’t grow so well.
7-30
In the morning, we go to see the plates. It’s really bad. There are blend bacteria growing on the plates. We still tranfer the strain into LB liquid to be shaking cultured. Later, we throw them away. Then use the rest plasmids to coat square plates again. And we make some solid LB medium.
Another student moved to the Laoshan dormitory.
7-31
The plates coated yesterday are not bad! But the ligated two still haven’t grew out.
In the morning, we transform the strain which were coated yesterday. Then activate the strain which have been persevered: no.4, no.5, no.2 and no.6. Streak culture them and ligate them again.
We have received the parts we asked from MIT. We coat them on square plates in the morning. At 8 a.m, we finished transforming strain and make them shake cultured. At 9:30 a.m, we finished no.4, no.5, no.2. and no.6’s streaking and cultured them in the incubator. At 10 a.m, new parts have been streaked and cultured in the incubator. In the afternoon, we make up some antibiotics. Extract no.11’s plasmids which have failed to be transformed to study how to increase plasmids’ concentration and at the same time keep proteins’ remnants at a low level.
Stay up to finish three tasks: preserve and extract the plasmids of transformed bacteria; transform the parts which were streaked; streak two new antibiotics’ parts.
