Support and thanks
        The whole work of OUC-CHINA is done by 11 undergraduate students in OUC. During the process, the whole project is divided in different parts, such as design of gene loop, new biobrick  design, culture works and wiki. Not only everyone takes a part of duty, but also cooperates with others.
        Our project is supported by Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Tech Dr. XU Jian and Dr. LV Xuefeng allow us to do experiments in their lab, and help us academically. Their selfless care of us young researchers and strict science spirit really inspire us greatly. Our advisor TAN Xiaoming help us with the microbiology techniques and give advice when we encountered weird or tough problems, such as the analysis of gel result and offer reference information for us to learn. Other lab members also help us in teaching about how to use all kinds of facilities.
        College of marine life sciences in OUC also provides financial support for our registration fee. Our instructors have given us useful suggestion and academically support. Dr. YANG Guanpin works with us to design two of the whole five gene loops. Dr. SUI Zhenghong and Dr. ZHANG Xiaohua help us on microbiology.
        Besides, we are greatly appreciated: Dr. ZHANG Shicui who contributes $1,000 for our experimental fee; Dr. LIU Tao who gives us free DNA sequencing services and free PCR primers from Dr. LIU Xiaoshou. Professor WANG Xianghong and DONG Shugang also offer 1000RMB for our trip to Asia regional jamboree. Our idea is academically supported by Dr. SONG Linsheng from Institute of Oceanology, CAS.What makes us feel surprise and appreciate is 2 professors donate 1000RMB without leaving their names. Thus really let us feel encouraged, we will do our best!
        Apart from that，we must greatly thank the Zhu Jun professor, Zheng Huiming lecturer and Zheng’s graduate Ling Jun in Nangjing Agricultural University. They study the functional gene in Rhizobium, especially the genes about quorum sensing.  In our Wu Xing system, two novel quorum-sensing system in rhizobia is necessary. We learn experimental methods and get two kind of rhizobia from them.
        Finally, we want to say thanks to everyone who has shown their kindness to OUC-CHINA. We will exhaust our ability and let nobody feel disappointed!
Mutual help with other teams
        First, we want to thank Haoqian Zhang for his Enthusiastic help when we went to Peking University for experience consulting twice. Since it is the first year we took part in iGEM competition, we are unfamiliar with many affairs, his instructions help us a lot in our process.
        In return, after China Meet-up in July when we knew that Peking University were interested in our newly standardized biobricks would be useful for their project, we send three new modified strains to them, we hope that our new products will make any significance for their project.The information about the three standardized biobricks is as follows:
