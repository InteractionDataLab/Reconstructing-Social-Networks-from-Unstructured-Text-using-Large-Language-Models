Surely that synthetic biology will play an important role in future biotechnology application. Synthetic biology have shown obvious power in manufacture, environment application, medicine, new materials and all kinds of fields. But it seems that it only have connection with science subject. Our pioneering initiative lies in our combination with science and culture/philosophy, which in fact derive from the same origin before. We hope our work will remind people about this and open up a new application orientation for synthetic biology. It not only has physical creative, but has teaching, culture communication meanings as well. We hope our work will at the same time arise great interest in Chinese culture and bring fresh spring to 2011 iGEM!<CENTER><B>No reins can fetter our imagination</B></CENTER>        One day in the future, you would not find it odd that your doctor suggests you some engineering bacteria strains to treat your enteritis, gastritis or even diabetes mellitus. Based on standard gene parts, scientists can synthesize new bacteria expressing protein medicine directly in your alimentary duct. It will be a more efficient, convenient, and more comfortable——you will not even feel it.        Besides, how about feeding your plants with a new organic fertilizer? This new kind of organic fertilizer is composed by synthetic bacteria, which can produce all organic nutriments that a plant needs. Moreover, the fertilizer has a long-lasting working expectancy in your flowerpot by resolving just a little humus. It can also be utilized in forest and grassland protection.        There may be a similar case that bacteria feeding can also be used in aquatic farms. The new fodder can provide a lot of essential organic nutrients to fish or algae and make feeding much easier: it is almost an automatic bio-metabolic mechanism.        Another amazing idea from our program is about exploration of lunar resources. There might be some new resources on the moon that we can use but now it’s hard for man to work on it. We suppose that one day we can create new bacteria which can live on the surface of moon and create enough oxygen in artificial confined space. Thus will allow us to build long-term base on moon and exploit it better.        I also believe that we will break the wall and turn prokaryotes into eukaryotes. Then we will have a larger stage to express our creation. Maybe a number of movie scenes will come true, such as <AVATAR>, <STAR war="">, and even <KUNG fu="" panda="">. Who knows? It all depends on how far we will go in the field of synthetic biology.        Indeed, as long as more and more standardized DNA parts were established, we would create more benefits to serve the whole world. If synthetic biology were a paper to be drawn, we have already picked up colorful pencils.</KUNG></STAR></AVATAR></P><DIV class="printfooter">
