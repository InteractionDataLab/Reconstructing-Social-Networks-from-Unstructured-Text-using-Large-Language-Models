Where we're from
Gaston Day School
Founded in 1967, Gaston Day School, is a non-sectarian, college prearatory institution for grades Pre-K through 12. Throughout our history, nearly 100% of Gaston Day School's graduating classes have entered four-year colleges and universities immediately upon graduation. Located in Gastonia, North Carolina, the school serves communities in a five-county area: Gaston, Lincoln, Cleveland, Mecklenburg and York counties. Enrollment is approximately 500 students.
Gaston Day School is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The school is a member of the Southern Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, and the North Carolina Association of Independent Schools.
Each of the students on the team has completed Honors Biology and will either be going into Chemistry, AP Biology, or both.
