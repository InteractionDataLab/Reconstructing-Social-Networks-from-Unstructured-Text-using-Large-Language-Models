BBa_K614000
PyeaR is a nitrate responsive promoter driving a red fluorescent protein reporter. It is made up of a PyeaR promoter that is responsive to nitrates (BBa_K216005), a ribosome binding site (BBa_B0030), a sequence to create red fluorescent protein (BBa_E1010), and the stop codon (BBa_B1006). The RBS, coding region, and stop codon are already combined in BBa_K081014.  In the presence of nitrates, BBa_K216005 will allow production of the RFP mRNA. Additional details are available on the Registry page accessible from the link at the top.
