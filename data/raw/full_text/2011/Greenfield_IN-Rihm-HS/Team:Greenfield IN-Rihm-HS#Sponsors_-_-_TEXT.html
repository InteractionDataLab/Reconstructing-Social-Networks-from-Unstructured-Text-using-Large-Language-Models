Xylogenics is commercializing a breakthrough technology that was developed in an Indiana University School of Medicine genomics lab. The technology is a bioengineered yeast that improves ethanol production by 30 – 50%. Ethanol is a renewable energy source that can supplement or replace gasoline as a proven source for transportation fuel. They have graciously donated $1,000 to our iGem team.
Autodesk, Inc., a world leader in 2D and 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software, has joined as an iGEM sponsoring partner. Autodesk will provide iGEM teams with Autodesk Maya®, and virtually all other Autodesk software, to help animate and simulate in 3D their projects.
