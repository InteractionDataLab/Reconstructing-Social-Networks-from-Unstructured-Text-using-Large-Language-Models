Template Source:  Where the template is originally from, such as 2011 Parts Kits, Synthesized Gene, Genomic, etc
Forward Primer (5'->3'):   Full sequence of the Forward primer used
Reverse Primer (5'->3'):    Full sequence of the Reverse primer used
Annealing Temperature (Celsius):  The annealing temperature used in the PCR reaction
Extension Time (seconds):   The extension time used in the PCR reaction
Percent DMSO:  Was DMSO added, if not 0, if so at what %
Polymerase Used:  Which polymerase enzyme was used (e.g. Phusion, Taq, Vent, Pfu, etc)
Primer Name:  The name of the primer ordered
Additional Notes:  Any additional relevant information
