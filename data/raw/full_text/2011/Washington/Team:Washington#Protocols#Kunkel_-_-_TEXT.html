Produce ssDNA (RECOMMENDED TO DO IN DUPLICATE! SEE NOTE AT END OF SECTION 2)
Transform plasmid into chemically competent CJ236 cells
Plate onto a Chlor+YOUR ANTIBIOTIC plate and incubate overnight at 37°C
Inoculate 6 colonies into 3ml of LB + YOUR antibiotic (NO chlor here per NEB instructions)
Grow for 4-6 hours at 37°C, shaking at 200rpm (until cloudy)
Add 3ul of M13K07 helper phage
Continue growing for 1 hour at 37°C, shaking at 200rpm
Expand culture by diluting 1mL into 50ml of LB + antibiotic in 250ml flask
Grow for 12 hours (no more than 16) at 37°C, shaking at 200rpm
Harvesting ssDNA
Spin down overnight culture in sterile 50ml Falcon tube at 7000rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C
Transfer supernatant (contains phage) to a new sterile 50ml Falcon tube
Add 10ml 20% PEG/2.5M NaCl and mix thoroughly
Incubate on ice for 45 minutes
Spin down the phage at 7000rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C
Decant liquid and let tube stand upright to drain off the rest of the liquid
Resuspend the pellet in 1mL 1xPBS (Vortexing is okay)
Transfer the 1mL into a microfuge tube
Spin at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes
Transfer the supernatant to a new microfuge tube with 300ul PEG/NaCl
Vortex and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
Spin down phage at 14,000rpm for 2 minutes
Pipette off supernatant; do a second quick spin to collect residual liquid and pipette it off
Resuspend the pellet (phage) in 1ml 1xPBS
Spin down at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes
Transfer the supernatant (phage) to a new microfuge tube
Harvesting ssDNA from Phage using Qiagen Qiaprep M13 kit (#27704)
DO NOT SPIN OVER 8000rpm when using this kit!
Final solution should be greater than 20ng/uL.  If not, try again; ssDNA can randomly fail, so it is best to make 2 batches in parallel (works as a nice counter balance as well).
Kinasing Oligos
Design mutagenic oligo using Stratagene’s primer design and order the 5’->3’ antisense oligo
This is specific for pET29b+, other vectors may require the sense oligo

Make Kinase Reaction Mix (make #rxn+2)
3uL Kinase Buffer/rxn
1uL of 10mM ATP/rxn
1uL T4 Polynucleotide Kinase/rxn
18uL ddiH2O/rxn
Combine oligo and reaction mix in PCR strip tubes or 96well PCR Plate
Aliquot 23uL of Kinase Reaction Mix using repeater
Make sure all liquid at the bottom by tapping or briefly spinning
Add 7uL of 100uM oligo to the BOTTOM of each well and pipette up and down
Seal, mix gently by tapping, and incubate at 37deg C (metal bath or PCR machine) for 1 hour
Store on ice short term, or -20 long term
These can be re-used in the future so no need to throw them away!
Dilute Mutagenic Kinased Oligo (Optimal molar ratio is 1:4   dU-ssDNA:Oligo)
Add 2uL of oligo into 200uL of diH2O
If doing a mutant with multiple oligos add 2uL of EACH oligo to the same tube
This dilution factor will achieve the desired 1:4 dU-ssDNA:Oligo molar ratio for most single stranded DNA preps.
Anneal Diluted Oligo and ssDNA
Combine 0.2uL of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer with 2uL of ssDNA, (make #rxn+2)
Aliquot 2.2uL of the mix into a in a fresh PCR plate or strip tubes
Make sure all the liquid as the bottom by spinning down or tapping
Add 2uL of THE DILUTED kinased primer (single or mixed) to generate desired mutant to the bottom of the plate and PIPPETE UP AND DOWN TO MIX
Always do a background as well where you have ssDNA with NO oligo (just add 2uL of water).  This will allow to you to know if you mutations work and estimate your mutation efficiency so you can pick the appropriate number of colonies you need to screen in order to find the mutation desired.
Seal, mix (tapping or plate mixer)
Run Siegel: Anneal in PCR machine (USE heated lid)
Starts at 95 degrees and ramps down to 25 over an hour
I find the slow ramp decreases background and increases overall kunkel efficiency relative to the quick protocol, which does 95-2min; 50-2min; 25-forever
Polymerize DNA
Make polymerization reaction mixture (make #rxn+2)
0.6uL 10x T4 Ligase Buffer/rxn
0.4uL 25mM dNTPs/rxn
0.4uL 10mM ATP/rxn
0.4uL T7 Polymerase (unmodified from NEB)/rxn
0.4uL T4 Ligase/rxn
Add 2.2uL of polymerization reaction mixture to each annealing reaction
Seal, mix (tapping or plate mixer)
Incubate at room temperature for 1+ hrs.
Transform
Electroporation Method
Dialyze DNA (ORDER IS IMPORTANT HERE!!!!):
Add ~40mL of diH2O to an empty Petri dish (till it is mostly full)
Mark up to 8 spots on the shiny side of a 0.025um membrane filter
Place the filter into the diH2O so shiny side is up and it is flat
DO NOT SUBMERGE!
CAREFULLY pipette the 5uL reaction onto the designated spots
Let dialyze for 45+ minutes
While DNA is dialyzing, remove an aliquot of BL21 DE3* electro-competent cells from Box labeled “Jasmine”, tubes labeled E*)
Place the cell aliquots on ice and allow them to thaw.
Aliquot 40 uL of each aliquot into a separate, labeled, sterile Eppendorf tube.
Electroporate:
CAREFULLY remove as much of the DNA as possible from the membrane and pipette into an Eppendorf tube containing 40 uL of thawed electro-competent BL21 DE3* cells.
Transfer cell/DNA mixture to a 0.1cm electroporation cuvette which has been pre-chilled on ice, and return the cuvette to the ice.
Place into BioRad electroporater (only fit in 1 way) set to Bacteria and hit “Pulse”
IMMEDIATELY add 300uL of media (TB or LB, NO antibiotic) into the cuvette to extract cells, transfer to a fresh strip tube or PCR plate.
Recover and Plate:
Incubate transformed cells at 37°C for ~30-45 minutes
Plate out ~200uL of each reaction on individual plates
Add ~10 glass beads/plate
Shake to spread
Turn plate and tap so beads are transferred to the lid, than pour out beads into 70% EtOH filled beaker.
Turn plates so agar side is up and incubate at 37°C overnight
Heat Shock Method
In a 14mL falcon add 5uL of Polymerization reaction and 50uL of BL21(DE3)*  (Chemical comp NOT electro comp)
Incubate on ice for 20+ minutes
Heat Shock by submerging the bottom of the tube in a 42deg water bath for 1 minute
45 seconds to 90 seconds is fine, 1 minute is generally safe
Return to ice for ~2minutes
Add 200uL of TB no antibiotic
Recover by shaking at 37deg for 1hr
On individual plates plate out ~200uL of each reaction
I find it works best to do 12 plates at a time
Add ~10 glass beads/plate
Shake to spread
Turn plate and tap so beads are transferred to the lid, than pour out beads into 70% EtOH filled beaker.
Move to the next row.
Turn plates so agar side is up and incubate at 37deg overnight
