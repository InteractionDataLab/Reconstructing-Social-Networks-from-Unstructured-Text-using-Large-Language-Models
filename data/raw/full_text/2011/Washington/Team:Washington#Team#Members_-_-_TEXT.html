Who did what
The teams were assembled during our winter quarter. During this term, we went around to classes and had weekly meetings to introduce students to synthetic biology through a series of guest lectures. During the spring, students participated in brainstorming projects related to the sponsoring Faculty advisors' labs (Baker and Klavins) and came up with the project they wanted to carry out. Students also planned and participated in community outreach events where we taught the local public about synthetic biology. Over the summer, students completed all of the experimental work, but worked closely with both graduate students and faculty advisors to plan the most pertinent experiments and make the most of our limited time.
The work documented here in this wiki and on our presentation is entirely the work of iGEM students - it does not represent the project of any host lab, advisor, or instructor participating in iGEM.
Diesel Production
After producing promising results, in future directions:
Casey Ager, Austin Moon, and Seth Sagulo worked on Enzyme Localization via Direct Fusion and Zinc Finger Fusion methods.
Juhye An, Elaine Lai, and Benjamin Mo worked on Decarbonylase Redesign
Marika Cheng and Justin De Leon worked on Alternative Chassis
Chris Choe and David Zong worked on Alternate Aldehyde Production
Matthew Harger worked on Branched Alkanes Production
Matthew Harger and Lei Zheng worked on System Optimization
Emily Yang worked on modelling the alkane production pathway.
Gluten Destruction
Sydney Gordon, Daniel Hadidi, Liz Stanley, Angus Toland, Sarah Wolf, and Sean Wu designed, built, and tested Kumamolisin-As and over 100 mutants to combat gluten intolerance by increasing the activity on the PQLP antigenic peptide.
iGEM Toolkits
Michael Brasino, Rashmi Ravichandran, and Alicia Wong worked on extracting and BioBricking the essential genes for magnetosomes, made the fusion proteins, and did the experimental measurements.  They also expanded on work that was started by UW iGEM students in 2010, by constructing more Gibson-friendly plasmid backbones and characterizing the Gibson-assembly efficiencies of pSB and pGA plasmids.
Community Outreach
Cindy Wu headed and organized all iGEM 2011 Community Outreach events.
