Protein Expression/Purification of Recombinant Protein in pET29b+ Using Autoinduction
Contents
1 Protein Expression/Purification of Recombinant Protein in pET29b+ Using Autoinduction
1.1 Expression
1.2 Purification
1.3 Buffers
Adopted from Protein production by auto-induction in high-density shaking cultures by Studier
Expression
1.Transform pET29b+ DNA into BL21(DE3)* competent cells, plate on KAN.
a.You can skip this step if there is already a glycerol stock in BL21(DE3)*
b.Combine 1uL of DNA + 20uL of cells in Falcon tube
i.Eppendorf is fine as well
c.Quickly immerse tube with cells in water batch at 42deg for 45sec
d.Remove and let rest on ice for 2min
e.Add 200uL of LB
f.Let recover, shaking at 37deg for 45min
g.Plate 200uL of cells onto a LB/Kan plate
2.Grow 0.5L cultures, in ZY Auto Induction media in 2L flask:
a.Thoroughly rinse out flask with HOT WATER
i.Removes trace bleach/soap/etc which can inhibit cell growth
b.RINSE WITH diH2O (remove tap water particulates)
c.5g Tryptone, 2.5g Yeast Extract + 465mL H2O. <---PREP THIS THE DAY BEFORE
i.Autoclave
ii.Let Cool down overnight
iii.Add Autoinduction Components
500uL 1M MgSO4
500uL 1000X Metals Mix
25mL 20X NPS
10mL 50X 5052
500uL 50mg/mL KAN
iv.Add cells to innoculate (100uL of an overnight culture or a scrape from a plate)
v.Grow at 37C for 3-6 hours (until visibly cloudy)
vi.Turn temp down to 18C and continue growth for 20-30 hours.
4.Collect Cells
5.Spin at 4000rpm for 20 minutes.
6.Discard supernatant
7.Resuspend pellet in 5mL 1x PBS, pH 7.4
8.Transfer to 50mL falcon tubes.
a.Run gel to confirm expression. (optional)
Purification
1.Prepare buffers (recipes on next page)
a.Wash buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 100mM, 25mM Imidazole (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 1mM TCEP
b.Lysis Buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 100mM, 25mM Imidazole (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 1mM TCEP, 2mg/mL lysozyme, 0.2mg/mL DNAse, 1mM PMSF
c.Elution buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 100mM, 200mM Imidazole (pH 8), 10% glycerol, 1mM TCEP
d.Dialysis buffer: 50mM HEPES (pH 8), NaCl 100mM, 10% glycerol, 1mM TCEP
d.NiNTA strip buffer: 100mM EDTA, pH 8.0
e.NiNTA recharge buffer: 100mM NiSO4
2.Lyse Cells (Sonication) -- ~5minutes/sample
a.Sonication
i.Make master mix of lysis buffer and add 15mL to each pellet and resuspend.  Vortexing ok.
3.After each pellet is resuspended, pour resuspension into cleaned SS34 tube.
a.Add more lysis buffer if necessary so that its roughly 3/4 full
5.Remove Insoluble Matter --  ~1hr (setup and walk away)
a.Balance samples in SS34 tubes (pairwise is sufficient)
b.Spin at >=18000rpm for >=30min at 4-15deg
6.  Bind to NiNTA Beads  --  20 minutes
a.  In the cold room, setup BioRad columns (Prepacked and with 1mL NiNTA) over a waste collection tray
b.  Let the 20% EtOH drain, was with 5mL of water, then wash with 5mL of your wash buffer
c.  Filter the supernatent of your protein using a 0.4 - 0.8micron filter
d.  Pour your filtered supernatent over the columns to let your protein bind
7.  Wash Off Unbound Protein  -- 1hr (pour on and walk away)
a.Wash column 3x with ~10-20mL wash buffer
8.  Elute off Bound Protein --  20minutes
a.Setup Vivaspin-20 Concentrator under columns
b.Add 15mL of elution buffer and collect in concentrators
9.Concentrate Proteins  --  30minutes
a/Spin at 8000 rpm for about 10-20min.
b.Target volume is 500uL
10.Remove Excess Imidazole
a.Transfer 800uL to a dialysis tube (midi, 50-800uL), save the remaining protein
i.Novagen Cat No 71507-3
b.Let equilibrate in 1L of Dialysis buffer for at least 2 hours in the cold room (overnight is fine)
c.Repeat so at least two rounds of dialysis have been done
11.Determine Protein Concentration
a.Check A280 on the NanoDrop
b.Calculate Protein Concentration
i.  Go to the Expasy ProtParam website
a. Translate your DNA sequence to protein sequence if necessary
ii.  Enter your sequence and compute paramters
iii.  Record the extinction coefficient of your protein
iv.  A = E* L * C ;   Path Length (L) From the nandrop is 1 cm, A is your A280 value from the nanodrop, E is your extinction coefficient from above (in M-1cm-1), C is your unknown concentration.
v.  Example:   Protein A280 is 3.3 and extinction coefficient is 24535,  so concentration is:  0.000135 M  or 135 uM
b.Run Gel of Samples
i.Make 1:10 dilution of lysis, supernatent
ii.Dilute preconcentrated and final protein so A280 ~1.5
