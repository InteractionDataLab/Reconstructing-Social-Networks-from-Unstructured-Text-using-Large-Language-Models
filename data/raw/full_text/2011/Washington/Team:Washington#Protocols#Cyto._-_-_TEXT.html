Colonies from plates:
Stab cells from isolated colony on plate and suspend them in 50 uL PBS buffer.
Dilute PBS culture by adding 1 uL to 100 uL fresh PBS buffer.
Measure fluorescence levels on cytometer.
Cells from liquid culture:
Grow cells to mid-exponential phase (generally, OD 0.1 to 0.2).
Dilute cells 1:20 in PBS buffer supplemented with chloramphenicol or kanamycin (choose an antibiotic the cells aren't resistant to), and store on ice.
Measure fluorescence levels on cytometer.
