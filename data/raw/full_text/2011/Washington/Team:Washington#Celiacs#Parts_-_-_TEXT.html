Gluten Destruction: Parts Submitted
Gluten Destruction submitted five parts to the registry: Wild-type Kumamolisin-As and four of our promising mutants. A short description for each part is provided below.
BBa_K590021: Kumamolisin-As
An enzyme from the sedolisin family native to Alicyclobacillus sendaiensis with known collagenase activity at low pH and elevated temperatures.
BBa_K590022: Kumamolisin-As_G319S, D358G, D368H
A mutated Kumamolisin-As enzyme aimed to combat gluten intolerance by increased activity on the PQLP peptide, an antigenic epitope in gliadin. This mutant has point mutations at residues 319, 358, and 368 from Glycine to Serine, Aspartate to Glycine, and Aspartate to Histidine, respectively.
BBa_K590023: Kumamolisin-As_N291D
A mutated Kumamolisin-As enzyme aimed to combat gluten intolerance by increased activity on the PQLP peptide, an antigenic epitope in gliadin. This mutant has a point mutation at residue 291 from Asparagine to Aspartate.
BBa_K590024: Kumamolisin-As_S354N, D358G, D368H
A mutated Kumamolisin-As enzyme aimed to combat gluten intolerance by increased activity on the PQLP peptide, an antigenic epitope in gliadin. This mutant has point mutations at residue 354, 358, and 368 from Serine to Asparagine, Aspartate to Glycine, and Aspartate to Histidine, respectively.
BBa_K590087: KumaMax (aka, Kumamolisin-As_N291D, G319S, D358G, D368H)
A mutated Kumamolisin-As enzyme aimed to combat gluten intolerance by increased activity on the PQLP peptide, an antigenic epitope in gliadin. This mutant is the best combinatorial mutant found and has point mutations at residues 291, 319, 358, and 368 from Asparagine to Aspartate, Glycine to Serine, Aspartate to Glycine, and Aspartate to Histidine, respectively.
