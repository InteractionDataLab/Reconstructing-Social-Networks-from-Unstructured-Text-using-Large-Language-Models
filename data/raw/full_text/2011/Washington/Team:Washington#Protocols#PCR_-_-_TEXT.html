General PCR Protocol
Setup Amplification PCR Reaction
1uL Template
1uL 25mM dNTP's
10uL Phusion HF Buffer
0.5uL Forward Primer (Tm XX oC)*
0.5uL Reverse Primer (Tm YY oC)*
0.5uL Phusion polymerase
36.5uL diH2O
Amplification PCR Reaction
98 oC - 30s
98 oC - 10s
ZZ oC - 10s*
72 oC - 30s/kb target gene
Repeat 2-4 29x
72 oC - 5min
10 oC - forever
Tms of all primers must first be calculated after primer design.  Annealing temperature (represented by ZZ above) should be 2 oC higher than XX or YY, whichever is lower.
