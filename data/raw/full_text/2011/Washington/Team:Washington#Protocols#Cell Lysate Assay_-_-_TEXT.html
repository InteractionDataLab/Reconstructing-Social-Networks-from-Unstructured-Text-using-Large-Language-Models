Safety
Whole Cell Lysate Assay
Spin down cells from expression cultures at 4000rpm for 20min, pour off supernatant and perform either Triton Lysis or Sonication Lysis.
Triton Lysis
Triton Lysis Buffer (10mL, enough for 2 plates)
9mL of 1x PBS
10mg of Lsyozyme (5-20 is fine)
5mg of DNase (2-10 is fine)
1mL of 10% Triton X100
Add 50uL of Triton lysis buffer to each well
Shake on High Speed Plate Shaker (Set to 1500rpm, in J562) for 20-60 minutes
Add 250uL of 100mM NaOAc pH 4.0 to each well
Spin 40 minutes 4000rpm
Sonication Lysis
Add 300uL of 100mM NHAc pH 4.0 to each well
No lysozyme or DNase needed as sonication will break up the cell wall AND the genomic DNA
Use Plate Sonicator (Ask Chris)
Spin 40 minutes 4000rpm
2.Assay
Add 90uL of 5microM substrate (in NaAc pH 4.0 buffer) to each well of a black fluorescent microtiter assay plate
Start reaction by adding 10uL Supernatent (try to avoid bubbles and pippette quickly, but accurately)
Use the P20 multichannel with a taped cardboard stopper to make sure you don't hit the pellet!
Monitor the reaction with the SpectraMax
