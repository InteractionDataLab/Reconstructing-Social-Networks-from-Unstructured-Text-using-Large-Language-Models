Diesel Production: Parts Submitted
The diesel production sub-team submitted many parts, but the below are our favorites along with a short description.   The comprehensive list can be found on the Parts Registry .
Composite
BBa_K590025 "The Petrobrick"
A modular and open platform for the biological production of diesel fuel. The Petrobrick consists of AAR and ADC , each behind a standard Elowitz RBS. All of this in psb1C3 regulated by a high constitutive promoter.
BBa_K590026 ADC-PSB1C3-High constitutive
The aldehyde decarbonylase behind a high constitutive promoter and an Elowitz RBS. This was an important negative control when testing for alkane production.
BBa_K590027 AAR-PSB1C3-High consititutive
The acyl-ACP reductase behind a high constitutive promoter and an Elowitz RBS. This was an important negative control when testing for alkane production.
Coding
BBa_K590031 Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 Aldehyde Decarbonylase
This part encodes an enzyme Aldehyde Decarbonylase (ADC) that removes the carbonyl group (C=O) from a fatty aldehyde, yielding an alkane one carbon shorter than the original aldehyde and a molecule of formate.  This part has been codon-optimized for E. coli.
BBa_K590032 Acyl-ACP Reductase
This part encodes an enzyme that reduces cellular fatty acyl-ACPs, from the bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, into fatty aldehydes. This part has been codon optimized for E. coli.
