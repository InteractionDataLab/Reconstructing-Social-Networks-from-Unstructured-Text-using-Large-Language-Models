Our basic alkane production system requires  the expression of two genes, an Acyl-ACP Reductase(AAR), and an Aldehyde Decarbonylase(ADC)(note:link to registry pages here). We coexpressed both genes on a Constiuitive PSB1C3 expression vector( K314100 ). This construct allows for constituitive expression without induction.
