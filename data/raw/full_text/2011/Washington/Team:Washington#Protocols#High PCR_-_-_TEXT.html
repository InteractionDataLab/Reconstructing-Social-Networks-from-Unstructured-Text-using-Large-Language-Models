High-Yield PCR (Full-Gene Assembly)
In an appropriately labeled tube, combine the following:
20 μL flash mastermix
2 μL of each primer being used
~5 ng of DNA.
total reaction volume = The total reaction volume 40 μL
Supplement the remaining volume with water.
Load the sample in the PCR machine and select an appropriate program based on the primer design.
Our primers were designed to have an annealing temperature of ~ 65oC.
"iGem Flash" = 35-40 cycles:
98oC - 10s
98oC - 5s
63oC - 5s
72oC - 1min
72oC - 3min
4oC - infinite
Once the PCR is finished, run 4 μL of each sample on a diagnostic gel to visualize approximate band lengths.
Incubate the remaining 36 μL of each sample with 1 μL DPN 1 (enzyme) @ 37oC for 1 hour.
Purify each sample using a similar approach to the Gibson DNA purification protocol.
