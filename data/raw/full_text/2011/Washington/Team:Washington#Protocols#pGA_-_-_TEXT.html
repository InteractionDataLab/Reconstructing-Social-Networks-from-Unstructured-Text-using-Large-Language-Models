Gibson assembly efficiency assay
PCR
The PCR reactions were conducted at 20 μL volumes with 2x Phusion Flash polymerase master mix, 1 ng plasmid template, and 0.5 μM of each primer.
For the pGA assay, the insert came from a pGA1C3 vector and the insert came from a pGA1A3 vector expressing GFP. We used primers pGAprefix_fwd and pGAsuffix_rev to amplify the insert, and pGAsuffix_fwd and pGAprefix_rev to amplify the backbone.
For the pSB assay, the insert came from a pSB3K3 vector and the insert came from a pSB1A3 vector expressing low GFP levels that are not strong enough to see visually. We used pre-existing Biobrick primers BioBrick_f and BioBrick_r to amplify the insert and Suffix_f and Prefix_r to amplify the backbone.
Gibson reactions
After performing PCR as outlined above, each fragment was run on a 1% agarose gel and gel-extracted using a Qiagen QIAquick gel extraction kit. 20 ng of gel-extracted insert and 20 ng of gel-extracted backbone were added to a 20 μL Gibson reaction which was set up on ice and incubated at 50°C for one hour.
pGA transformations
pGA vector Assembly
Note: Prepare these mixtures on ice
Obtain a 40 uL aliquot of BL21 cells.
Add 120 uL of ice water to the aliquot.
The total volume is now 160 uL; split evenly among four labeled tubes: INS + BCK, INS + BCK, INSctrl, BCKctrl.
INS + BCK tubes (x 2)
add 1 uL of 10x-diluted pGA Gibson product (1A3 BCK/INS pLacGFP)
INSctrl tube
add 100 pg of pLacGFP gel extract
BCKctrl
add 100 pg of 1A3 gel extract
pSB transformations
Repeat the process for the comparison pSB vector as follows:
pSB vector Assembly
1 uL of pSB Gibson product (T19-1A3/pLacGFP)
1 ng INS (pLacGFP- gel extract)
1 ng BCK (T19-1A3- gel extract)
Once all the samples are ready, begin the transformation .
Rescue each sample in 500 mLs of LB
Incubate all samples @ 37oC for ~45 min.
Plate 50 uL on each sample onto a LB + Chlor + Amp + IPTG plate.
1 plate for each control in each vector set.
3 plates for each Gibson product tube in each set. ( 6 plates for each vector set + 2 control plates)
