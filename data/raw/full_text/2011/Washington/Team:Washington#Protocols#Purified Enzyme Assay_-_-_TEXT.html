Enzyme Assay
Substrate
The substrate was ordered at a 20% discount from Anasepc in support of Undergraduate education.  The peptide Motif PQPQLP commonly found in gluten was synthesized with a fluorophore (5-FAM) or Quencher (QXL52) available from anaspec.  It is denoted as the following
Ordered Peptide (95% Purity):  QXL520-PQPQLP-K(5-FAM)-NH2
Assay
Add 90uL of 5uM substrate (in NaAc pH 4.0 buffer) to each well of a black fluorescent microtiter assay plate
Start reaction by adding 0.0125mg/mL enzyme (try to avoid bubbles and pippette quickly, but accurately)
Use the P20 multichannel with a taped cardboard stopper to make sure you don't hit the pellet!
Monitor the reaction with the SpectraMax
