pGA vector Assay
Prepare these mixtures on ice
Obtain a 40 uL aliquot of BL21 cells.
Add 120 uL of ice water to the aliquot.
The total volume is now 160 uL; split evenly among four labeled tubes: INS + BCK, INS + BCK, INSctrl, BCKctrl.
INS + BCK tubes (x 2)
add 1 uL of 10X pGA Gibson product (1A3 BCK/INS pLacGFP)
INSctrl tube
add 100 pg of pLacGFP gel extract
BCKctrl
add 100 pg of 1A3 gel extract
Repeat steps 1-3 for the comparison vector pSB using the following instead:
1 uL of pSB Gibson product (T19-1A3/pLacGFP)
1 ng INS (pLacGFP- gel extract)
1 ng BCK (T19-1A3- gel extract)
Once all the samples are ready, begin the transformation .
Rescue each sample in 500 mLs of LB
Incubate all samples @ 37oC for ~45 min.
Plate 50 uL on each sample onto a LB + Chlor + Amp + IPTG plate.
1 plate for each control in each vector set.
3 plates for each Gibson product tube in each set. ( 6 plates for each vector set + 2 control plates)
