Microbial Alkane Production Protocol
Contents
1 Microbial Alkane Production Protocol
1.1 Current Protocol for 100mL of Media
1.1.1 Long Term Stocks to Prepare
1.1.2 100mL M9 minGlucose Media Prep
1.1.3 General Production Protocol
Current Protocol for 100mL of Media
Adopted From Supplemental Information In Microbial Biosynthesis of Alkanes Science Report
Long Term Stocks to Prepare
Store at room temperature unless otherwise noted
1L of 1M Bis‐Tris (pH 7.25)
10mL of 1mg/mL  Thiamine  (store at -20 in 1mL aliquots)
10mL of 10%  Triton X-100
1M  MgSO4
0.1M FeCl3-6H2O
100mL M9 minGlucose Media Prep
ADD IN ORDER, make sure you have a sterilized Erlenmeyer flask for the initial mixing and a sterilized bottle to sterile filter into
Constantly mix using a stir bar
75mL ddiH2O
3g glucose  (Final 3%,  100% = 1g/mL)
0.6g Na2HPO4
0.3g KH2PO4
0.05g NaCl
0.2g NH4Cl
20mL of 1M Bis-Tris (pH 7.25)
1mL of 10% Triton
100uL of 1mg/mL thiamine
100uL of FeCl3-6H2O
100uL of MgSO4
Once media is prepared sterile filter into a pre-sterilized glass bottle
General Production Protocol
Grow 5mL of cells in Terrific Broth with Antibiotics overnight to saturation in 14mL culture tube
Measure OD (should be roughly 1.5)
Spin down cells at 4000rpm for 10 minutes
Resuspend in 1mL of sterile ddiH2O and transfer to a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube
Spin down cells at 4000rpm for 10 minutes
Resuspend in 1mL of sterile ddiH2O and transfer to a 1.5mL Eppendorf tube
Spin down cells at 4000rpm for 10 minutes
Resuspend in 0.7mL of Production Media with Antibiotic
Transfer to a 24mL 13x250
Seal the top with alluminum foil and grow at 37degC for 48 hours
Extract by adding 0.7mL of EthylAcetate, vortex, transfer to an Eppendorf tube, and spin at max speed for 1minute.
Remove 200uL of the top Ethyl Acetate layer into a glass vial with insert
Run sample on GC-MS and identify Alkanes
