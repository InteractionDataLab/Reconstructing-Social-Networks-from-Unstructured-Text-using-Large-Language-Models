Damien Geeraerts
Damien is trying to write his PhD thesis, when he is not answering our many  questions or giving us technical pointers. He is working on toxin-antitoxin  systems; specifically he is trying to find new such systems in a variety of  bacteria. He got pulled in as advisor since he is the yeast guy of the lab;  since then his writing output dropped dramatically thanks to the iGEM.
