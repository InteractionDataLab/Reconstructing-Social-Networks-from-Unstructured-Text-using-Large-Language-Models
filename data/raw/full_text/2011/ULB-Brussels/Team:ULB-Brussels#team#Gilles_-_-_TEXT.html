Gilles Vanwalleghem
When he is not helping the team, Gilles is finishing a PhD on the  interactions between Trypanosoma brucei, a nasty parasite responsible for  the sleeping sickness, and innocent mice. He became interested in synthetic  biology after seeing Drew Endy give a talk; he then discovered the iGEM and  started the ULB-Brussels team in 2008.
