Introduction Removing  antibiotics resistance gene Questionnaire Debate Bibliography
Introduction
In this report, we present the bioethics part of the ULB-Brussels project.
In the first section, we sum up our project from an ethical and theoretical point of view:
what about the resistance to antibiotics?
what is clean biology?
In the second section, we discuss the questionnaire given to a sample of the population.
What was this questionnaire about?
What were our results?
How can we discuss them?
And then in the third and last section, we analyze the debate we organized with the other Belgian team, the KULeuven Team, and draw conclusions about what we learned during this debate.
