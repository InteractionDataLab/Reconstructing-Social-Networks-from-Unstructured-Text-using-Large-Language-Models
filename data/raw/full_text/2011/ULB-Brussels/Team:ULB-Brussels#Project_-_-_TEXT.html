One of the most basic actions of all engineers is the asembly and the deletion of fundamental parts (bricks. Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of the iGEM is to make the link between synthetic biology and engineers sciences, we'd like to manage those simple steps in the easiest way in biological systems. Unfortunately, in E. coli, it's still difficult to do that in one step because of the lack of genetic tools to catalyze homologous recombination with linear DNA. By the assembly of an unique plasmid containing different genes derived from phages, and the design and construction of receiver plasmids, we aim to provide the iGEM with a system that would confer to E. coli the useful properties of yeasts.
The biological circuit is being modelized at the moment by a modelling team of mathematists and physicists in order to find the best combinations. This same team will also use parameters derived from our characterizations of the genetic circuit to refine the final model. Finally, the Human Practise team, composed of students from social science, will discuss the ethical problems asked by people when living organisms are being handled. The team aims to understand people's fears and to give them clues to answer themselves to theses questions.
