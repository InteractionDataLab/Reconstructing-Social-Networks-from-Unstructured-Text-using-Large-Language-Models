Modelling : Conclusion
Conclusion
The models we built in sections (\ref{Ph1}), (\ref{Ph2}) and (\ref{Ph3}) depended of many different parameters, that we where able to estimate with more or less precision by biological considerations or simple experiments. Moreover, we observed the small sensitivity of the solution of the model for those parameters, around their estimation, which is quite reassuring.
In order to validate our model quantitatively, it was necessary to find quantities that were not to harsh to measure or predict. That is what we fulfilled in section (\ref{validation}); a comparison of the measures and the predictions of the model then confirmed its validity and the judicious choice of the parameters.
Furthermore, our models predicts that after a too long time during the insertion step almost no bacteria will have the chloramphenicol resistance cassette yet, what was a big problem for the Wetlab team. However we saw that they should look around $t=t_\star\approx10000$, because at that time the proportion $p_2$ of the bacteria that have not lost the resistance cassette reaches its maximum $0.75$: around that time, so that a good deal of the bacteria then have received the X gene without having lost the resistance cassette. This could give ideas and clues to the Wetlab team for further interesting and fruitful experiments.
