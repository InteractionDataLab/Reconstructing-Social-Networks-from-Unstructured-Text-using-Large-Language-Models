Laurence Van Melderen
Head of the Bacterial Genetics and Physiology lab of the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. The Bacterial Genetics and Physiology lab focuses on the understanding of bacterial adaptation to external conditions whatever they are- environment, human host. We are particularly interested in the fundamental mechanisms driving this high capacity to thrive in very diverse environments including horizontal gene transfer, global regulation of gene expression and virulence.
