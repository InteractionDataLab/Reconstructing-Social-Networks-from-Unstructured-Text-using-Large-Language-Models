Contributions
The project workload can be separated amongst its main elements:
Wetlab:
Design of the project: all of the students partook in the choice of the  subject; the wetlab team designed the project guided by the instructor and  advisors.
Experiments: they were done by the wetlab team (Sébastien Gérard,  François Delvin, Fanny Franchini, Thibaut Hallaert, Fanny Philippart,  Esther Brihaye, Arnaud Selvais) with some help from the modelling team (Maxime  Lucas, Pierre Corvilain, Mitia Duerinckx, François Thilmany, Jonathan  Frish). The host lab contributed with the work area and the advisors and  instructor gave technical advice.
Data analyses: this was done by the wetlab team.
Modelling:
The modelling was done by the modelling team with inputs from the wetlab team  for the biological relevance of the model and some data.
Human Practice:
Virginie Jacobs, Morgane Préat, Mathieu Peiffer were responsible of the  human practice part of the project; they interacted with the wetlab team to  define the societal problems that could be relevant to the project.
Wiki:
The wiki was the work of Sébastien Gérard, Maxime Lucas  and Pierre Corvilain. The professional website designer Thomas Huret helped them for the "Team" page.
