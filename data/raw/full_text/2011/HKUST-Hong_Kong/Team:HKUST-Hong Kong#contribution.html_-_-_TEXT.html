From 2011.igem.org
Contributions
iGEM  2011 HKUST team is composed of 29 undergraduate members, 10 advisors, and 3  instructors. Together, we have gone through successes, setbacks, and precious  moments as a team to beget the E. trojan.
The  project, starting from the proposal of its topic to its implementation and  finalization, is carried out independently by the team members. Our instructors  and advisors, however, have   provided us with great technical support and  invaluable experience sharing. Without them, there is no way the project could  reach its current state. Right now, we have submitted eight BioBrick parts, one  of which has been characterized and also a new plasmid vector. All of them were  designed and constructed through a great collaborative effort by our team members.
Laboratory work apart, our Human Practice Group also held a "Synthetic Biology Workshop" in September and conducted a “Synthetic Biology Survey” for the general public in Hong Kong (mostly alumni and students of HKUST). The questionnaire was disseminated from August to October this year. The lab tour in the workshop was coordinated by our instructor Dr. Jessica TANG. The survey was originated from IDC and Biofaction in Austria [kindly provided by Markus Schmidt, Lei Pei and Wolfgang Kerbe] and was further modified by our human practice team members.
Supports from external parties on data evaluation are documented in details on our Acknowledgements page.
