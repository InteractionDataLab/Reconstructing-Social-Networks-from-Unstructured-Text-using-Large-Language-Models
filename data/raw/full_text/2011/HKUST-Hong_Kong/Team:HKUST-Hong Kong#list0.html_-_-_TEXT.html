iGEM is a great place where we not only share our ideas, but also realize them by working as a team. I was fortunate to be a member of the 2010 HKUST iGEM team. This year, as an advisor, I witnessed the development of a brand new iGEM team, which was exciting and inspiring.
WANG Haoqing:
Hello everyone, here is Yimo, a positive person crazy for both sports and life science. I was also a memeber of last year's HKUST iGEM Team member. I'm glad to carry on my iGEM experience by serving as an advisor this year. I really enjoy the great time with all the other members, advisors and instructors, from whom I learned quite a lot. Things were so great, thank you guys!

I am Audrey Su, a Year 2 Biochemistry student. I am an adviser of the HKUST team, and I will be a volunteer for the Asian Jamboree. The two years' iGEM experience has enhanced my understanding of Synthetic Biology and love for this promising scientific field. iGEM is a learning process with both pains and fun.

Hi, there. I am a Junior student majoring in biochemistry. During my second year of iGEM, I found myself entering a deeper level of the life science world. Just can't help appreciate lives during this process.
