LU Wei & LI Zhuo:
We were members of the HKUST iGEM 2010 team and are curre! ntly serving as advisors for this year's UST team. We really enjoyed the process of understanding and solving problems, with all our fellow teammates, advisors and instructors, using every bit of our intellect and dedication. It is great to witness the 2011 team grow & good luck to HKUST iGEM 2011!
SU Min Hui:
I am Audrey Su, a Year 2 Biochemistry student. I am an adviser of the HKUST team, and I will be a volunteer for the Asian Jamboree. The two years' iGEM experience has enhanced my understanding of Synthetic Biology and love for this promising scientific field. iGEM is a learning process with both pains and fun.
ZHU Lin:
Hi, there. I am a Junior student majoring in biochemistry. During my second year of iGEM, I found myself entering a deeper level of the life science world. Just can't help appreciate lives during this process.
