Reflection
We design a feedback form for all the secondary students to fill in. From all the feedback forms, they all think the whole workshop is interesting and helpful. They come into the workshop without so much knowledge about Synthetic Biology at first but after this workshop, they all get some basic idea of what synthetic biology is. Below are some feedback given by secondary students:
"The workshop is very interesting and informative. You explained it in a way that I can understand and take in the knowledge easily."
"Thank you to everyone involved in this workshop which all of us greatly enjoyed. All the activities were interesting and well organized and all of the iGEM Team members encourage all students to participate in the workshop actively. "
"I thought the card game was very out thought out and was very useful as well as interesting."
"I really liked this workshop! It used creative ways to introduce a very new topic and it was extremely successful!"
"This was a very inspiring workshop-not only was it fun, but it was also very informative. Thank you!"

Whose continuous support and guidance make this workshop possible.
Here comes the reflection of our iGEM Team members.
Claire, WU Yunmin:
“Synthesis”, instead of cheers, the student shouted with a big smile when we took the big photo at last. As a helper, I was pretty sure that they had spent a happy morning with us, and more importantly captured the fundamental concepts of what synthetic biology does and how it basically works.
The workshop was my first time to introduce synthetic biology as well as our project to someone outside the campus and someone I have ever met. It was not until this workshop when I proudly talking about our project that I realized that how much I had devoted to the project and how deep I was in love with it. Besides, it taught me that teamwork matters a lot. In the process, we argued, we fought, but nothing prevented us from working for the same goal. The dispute didn’t split us but made the bonding between us even stronger. I really appreciated having a wonderful team like this and I will be working towards such kind of team in future projects.
Steven, Deng Yisong:
We did make efforts in the preparation process and those students' smiling face make me believe that all the time and energy involved is not wasted. I am pretty glad to know that most of them got to know something about synthetic biology and they will tell others what they have learnt in our workshop.
Michael, LU Yang:
As a member of the Human Practice group of iGEM 2011 HKUST Team, I am amazed and satisfied by what we have done in the past few months. The task was not easy, and we sacrificed much time designing the whole progress, discussing every detail of the activities, preparing the materials, having rehearsals while working on wet lab day after day as well. However, we achieved our goal perfectly. The secondary school students felt excited in our workshop and enjoyed their time, which is the best reward for the whole human practice group. The new area of synthetic biology is also better known by those young students and the workshop aroused their interest in this area. I feel so proud of our achievements.
Shirley, XU Jiajing:
During the workshop, I was strongly impressed by the creativity and enthusiasm of the secondary school students we invited to our workshop. To be honest, they contributed a lot to the overall success of our workshop. Of course, helpers' and organizers' hardworking also has played an important role. As an organizer and helper, I should say it is true that the preparing work for such a novel synthetic biology workshop is tiring. You should start from the every simple point and organize a whole picture by yourselves. However, once you saw people actually enjoyed a lot in it, you would feel all was rewarding.
