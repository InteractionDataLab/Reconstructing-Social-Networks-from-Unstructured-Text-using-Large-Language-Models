Game Rules
Dice Types
There are three dices types in the game, a “move” dice for steps; a “card” dice for drawing cards; an “activation” dice for activating promoter.
“Card” dices have three colors: green for promoter, blue for gene, and yellow for function.
“Activation” dices have faces representing the respective activated promoter. They include T7, pLac, pBad and one blank face (no activation).
Playing the Game
Each turn is divided into 6 steps:
1) Roll the dice: The player rolls three dices: “move” dice, “card” dice, and “activation” dice.
2) Activate the promoter: Determined by the “activation” dice, activate all corresponding promoters on the table for each player. Calculate the new score.
3) Draw step: Draw a card according to the “card” dice.
4) Move step: The number of steps you move forward is determined by the “move” dice. Panel bonuses and penalties apply at the end of this step.
5) Play step: You may play up to 3 cards from your hand during this step.
6) Trading: You may trade 2 promoters in for 1 gene, or 2 genes for 1 promoter before you end your turn.
Constructing Pathways
To score points, you must first construct a completed pathway by pairing a promoter with a gene, and then place them on the table. You may construct any number of pathways, but once they are on the table, they cannot be returned to your hand.
Scoring
You earn points by following the criteria below:
1) You start with 100 points. Whenever a promoter is activated, the score on the gene is added to your total score.
2) Promoters are activated either by the “activation” dice, or corresponding function cards.
3) No promoters are activated during the first round and your promoters will no longer activate after the turn you pass the finish line.
4) Speed Bonus: The first player who finished the game will gain a bonus of 500 points while the second player will gain 200 points.
5) Card Bonus: After the game is finished, all the unused cards in your hand and function cards placed on the table will earn you 50 points each. All the completed pathways will count as 200 points each.
