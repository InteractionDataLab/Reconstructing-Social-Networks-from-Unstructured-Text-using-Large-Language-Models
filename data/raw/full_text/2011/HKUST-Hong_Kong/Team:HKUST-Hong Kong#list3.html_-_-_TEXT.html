WANG Yixin, Cynthia, Yr1 MATH:
WU Yunmin, Claire, Yr1 BICH:
Synthetic biology applies what we have to make up what we want, just like building up Lego. The magic lies in that the final product can never be predicted based on the raw materials we have so far. Even though today we are still at a preliminary stage, where changing or synthesizing a segment of DNA  may cost a lot of money and effort, we are determined to master it one day. Just one more thing to notice, the stronger the power, the more careful we have to be to deal with it.
