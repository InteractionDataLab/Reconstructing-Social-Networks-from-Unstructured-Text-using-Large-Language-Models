I am Steven, a Year 1 student majoring in Molecular Biomedical Sciences. During this summer, I learned a lot about synthetic biology and basic lab skills. Moreover, iGEM taught me how to work cooperatively with all of my teammates and achieve our goals as a whole.

I am Vincent Tong and I am a Year 2 student studying Biochemistry. It is my first time to know more about synthetic biology. In the project, I am very delighted to learn different wet lab skills like miniprep. and aseptic techniques. Moreover, I met many friends from different places and I was happy to chat with them. Thank you so much for iGEM HKUST.

iGEM is an exciting exploration for me, while it is a really great challenge for me as well. I knew nothing about synthetic biology before joining iGEM, but I have been working on a complex synthetic biology project for 3 months up to now. I am surprised and proud about what I have done in this period. I have learnt a lot from iGEM, not only biotechnology, but also the art of teamwork. And I got precious friendship with all the other team members as well. I love iGEM and I love HKUST 2011 iGEM team!
YUE Lu, Yellow, Yr1 BICH:
The synthetic biology is an extremely interesting and magical thing especially when you deal with the little and cute lives that can not be  seen by eyes.Based the current knowledge, actually what we can control is not so much and it always gives us a lot of surprise. Just learn form it and maybe a new finding will come to us!
