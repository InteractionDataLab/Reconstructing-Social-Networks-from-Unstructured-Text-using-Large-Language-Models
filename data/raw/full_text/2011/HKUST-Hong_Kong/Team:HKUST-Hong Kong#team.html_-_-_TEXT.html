iGEM has always been surprising me with its vivid illustration of how powerful synthetic biology can possibly be.
2. Audrey
The two years' iGEM experience has enhanced my understanding of Synthetic Biology and love for this promising scientific field. iGEM is a learning process with both pains and fun.
3.Yimo
I am a positive person crazy for both sports and life science. I really enjoy the great time with all the other members, advisors and instructors, from whom I learned quite a lot. Things were so great, thank you guys!
4. Wendy Lu & 5. Rory
We really enjoyed the process of understanding and solving problems, with all our fellow teammates, advisors and instructors, using every bit of our intellect and dedication. It is great to witness the 2011 team grow & good luck to HKUST iGEM 2011!
6. Jack
During my second year of iGEM, I found myself entering a deeper level of the life science world and have a deeper bonding with my fellow teammates.
7. Hanson
iGEM is a great place where we not only share our ideas, but also realize them by working as a team.This year, as an advisor, I witnessed the development of a brand new iGEM team, which was exciting and inspiring.
Team members:
1. Trevor
By manipulating genes we imitate the creations of God, and from failures I learned that the All Mighty patented his creations.

3. Peter
4. Steven
Thanks to iGEM, I have precious experience of working cooperatively with all of my teammates and achieving our goals as a whole.

Even though today we are still at a preliminary stage, we are doomed to master it one day. Besides,the stronger the power, the more careful we should be.
8. Cynthia Chen
Thanks to iGEM, I have really learned a lot during this summer. It's great to have a whole team working together for our goal. We love iGEM~

iGEM reflects many realities of scientific research, especially the need to do the mundane repeatedly to obtain success. YET, the best part of all, still, is when you receive the sequencing sheet, and realize that your construct is present and correct. Exhilarating!

Being on the iGEM team this year was an inspiring experience. I enjoyed the time spent in the lab debating over our data, not unlike the kind of thrill you feel when you place a piece of jigsaw puzzle into the right location.

3. Michael
4. Yellow
Synthetic biology is extremely interesting, especially when you deal with the little and cute lives that can not be seen by naked eyes. Based the current knowledge, actually what we can control is not so much and it always gives us a lot of surprise.

7. Shirley
I really enjoy the days spent with my smart groupmates in this year's iGEM and hope other participants can share the same experience with me.

In the project, I am very delighted to learn different wet lab skills like miniprep. and aseptic techniques. Moreover, I met many friends from different places and I was happy to chat with them. Thank you so much for iGEM HKUST.
