Data For Our Favorite New Parts:
1. BBa_K524000 – oriR101 & repA101-ts: This heat- sensitive origin of replication has been shown to be functional at 30°C. Partial loss of plasmid happens at 33°C, and complete loss of plasmid is observed at 37°C.
Parts Constructed But Not Characterized
1. BBa_K524001 – pLac + RBS + sfGFP1-10: This contains coding DNA sequences for superfolder GFP amino residues 1-214 driven by RBS BBa_B0034 and pLac BBa_R0010.
2. BBa_K524002 – pLac + RBS + sfGFP11 + double terminator: This contains coding DNA sequences for superfolder GFP amino residues 215-238 driven by RBS BBa_B0034 and pLac BBa_R0010, with double terminator B0015 at the end.
3. BBa_K524003 – nadE gene + double terminator: an essential gene that encodes constitutive expressed NAD+ synthetase.
4. BBa_K524004 – pir gene: the pir gene encodes the autogenously regulated pi protein.
5. BBa_K524005 – pToolkit: A plasmid that is only maintained in strains with genotype pir+. The plasmid was modified from another plasmid pKD46, which has been shown to trigger DNA recombination and subsequent gene knockout under induction of arabinose.
6. BBa_K524006 – RBS + sfGFP1-10: This contains coding DNA sequences for superfolder GFP amino residues 1-214 driven by RBS BBa_B0034.
7. BBa_K524007 – RBS + sfGFP11 + double terminator: This contains coding DNA sequences for superfolder GFP amino residues 215-238 driven by RBS BBa_B0034, with double terminator B0015 at the end.
8. BBa_K524100 – bcr CDS + double terminator B0015: The gene product is responsible for multidrug efflux system that pumps out antibiotics. Effect of pump was documented by other researchers: it confers varying degrees of resistance to 5 antibiotics.
