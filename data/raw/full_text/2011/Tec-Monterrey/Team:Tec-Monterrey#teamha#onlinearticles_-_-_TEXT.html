In collaboration with “Nueva Prensa” (New Press, a student group of our University), we released interesting articles to share with people unrelated to biotechnology and synthetic biology, even though it is part of their daily lives. Said articles consisted on facts commonly known by everyone, but whose way of functioning are unknown, as well as the explanation of diverse myths that exist about genetic engineering. Below, you can see the links corresponding to the articles issued by “Nueva Prensa” on their website (www.enepe.org).
This is an amazing world we all should know about, as science should be part of our daily lives both unconsciously and consciously.
