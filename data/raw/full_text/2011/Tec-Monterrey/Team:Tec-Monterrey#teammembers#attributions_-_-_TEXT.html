Team Attributions
Thelma Bolón
She was in charge of the enzymatic assay that involved one of our constructs, as well as general lab work. Her disposition and devotion are worth mentioning, as she never gave up on the toughest moments and always carried on with her endeavors.
Fausto Ortíz
He was in charge of the experiments that involved arabinose induction, as well as general lab work. Calm and collected, good-humored and always positive, he’s someone who kept his soul even after losing his gallbladder.
Anita Sifuentes
As our only non-B.S. student, she created the wiki and the video, and was as well involved in our augmented reality program. A small but great woman, who despite having a bigger understanding of computers than of her own body, became interested in the dream of a bunch of strangers and made great things out of it.
Camilo Chávez
He performed general laboratory work, helping to build one construct.  Such a weird and strange person who might as well become one of your best friends. Someone who can make you laugh just after he’s made you want to kill him, he’s got molecular biology skills that far surpass his DJ skills.
Rolando Moreno
He was responsible for contacting our sponsors and suppliers.  It’s said around campus that he’s a man full of love, and he very well is. With his great size also comes a great friend. Faster at thinking than at speaking, he always tries to find what’s better for everyone else.
Bong Min Bae
She performed general laboratory work, helping to build one construct. She was the main responsible of lab work and teaching several techniques to other team members. We are seriously hoping of hearing great things about this woman in the next 10 years, well, that’s if she starts sleeping just a bit. A total workaholic, she always does her best to make better everything that’s already perfect.
Gabriela Gutiérrez
She was in charge of the biosafety research and essay. Although small, her multitasking abilities are worth of awe. Even when doing five things at a time, she’s always focused on all of them. Her kindness and friendliness are equals, and she’ll never say “no” to a request of help.
Margarita Calixto
She was in charge of sponsors and of contact with iGEM headquarters. She’s also the mistress of electrocompetents. Not only pretty, but she also commits to whatever she’s doing in a kind of hardcore way. But anyway, the best of people are always hardcore, always giving the best of themselves and giving both soul and body at school, work and life.
Jesús Hernández
The unofficial leader of our team, he coordinated most of the lab work and worked a lot with diverse gels and the high performance gel imaging systems.  Although his looks are deceiving, he slowly became the key for getting the whole project going through the correct words and attitude, creativity and a whole lot of patience.
MS.C. Sergío García
Sergio taught us hands-on most of the non-basic protocols and procedures we needed in the laboratory. A true tor-mentor, both an angel and a demon coexisting in one being, not only because he’s also called Angel, but because an infinite source of knowledge and advise not only result in the best of projects, but also in the development of the best of scientists.
Dr. Manuel Zertuche
Dr. Zertuche, on behalf of the School of Biotechnology and Food Engineering of the Tecnológico de Monterrey. He provided us with the facilities and gave us his approval for almost everything we asked for. Before meeting him, we had never tried to reach for the stars, but he taught us how to do it. We’re really thankful for having you believe in us, and for giving us your smile on every visit. We thank you for being part of iGEM Tec-Monterrey 2011.
Dr. José Manuel Aguilar
He helped us with the theoretical information and developed the initial idea for our project. Way more than an instructor, he’s a friend who gave us all of his trust and affection; who taught us to think much more as researchers than as technicians. Thank you for all of the times when you made all of those questions we couldn’t answer, because that’s what a true teacher does: ask you for more every time, since he knows you’ve still got much more to give.
Dr. Guy Cardineau
He provided us with a lot of supplies, guidance and overall support, almost like a “lab-dad” for us. It’s because of professors like you that there are students like us, willing to follow your steps. You’ve taught us that dreams can become true, and that we’ve got to strive to reach them.
Dr. Marco Rito-Palomares
As our main instructor, he provided us the tools to keep on working. This dream could’ve not come true if you had not believed on us and given us the backup of the whole institution, teaching us that for realizing a dream, all you need is waking up from it.
Sincerely, the whole project would’ve gone to dust had it not been due to the commitment and dedication of each and every team member, who managed to come out unscathed from both good and bad situations gazing towards the future, together.
