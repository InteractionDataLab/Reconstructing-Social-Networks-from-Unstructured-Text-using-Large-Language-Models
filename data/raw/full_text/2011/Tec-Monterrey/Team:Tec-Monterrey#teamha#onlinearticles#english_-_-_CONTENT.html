The corn marketed as StarLink™  is one of the reasons this myth has spread, they
produce a protein endotoxin as insecticide.  This raised concern since it could be allergic or harmful for humans and, since the US Environmental Protection Agency could not find certainty of no harm to humans, the corn wasn’t approved for human consumption.
<B>Fact:  Conventional maize is transgenic. </B>
A transgenic organism is an
organism that contains a gene or genes transferred from another organism (this
could be from the same or from a different species). According to an article by the
CANIA (an institute of nutrition of Venezuela), maize crops  are the ones
with the highest level of domestication in cultivated plants. This means that
man, considering the properties like the size or the resistance to heat, selects the
crops. The selection of the best species is necessary to improve the quality of the product.

Because of the cultural features, a lot of options are available. Either natural
or induced, causing the existence of many varieties and hybrids.  We can
call all these hybrids “transgenic”, because they contain genes from others plants.
Therefore, all the corn that we consume is a transgenic organism with a mixture
of genes that our ancestors considered the best options to improve the maize.

The corn marketed as StarLink™ is not only an example of genetically modified
organism (GMO) with issues, but also an example of the regulations of the GMO
don't allow the release of a product that can be harmful for humans.
<B>Myth: Biotechnological modifications of crops and foods are very different from traditional methods. </B><B>Reality</B>: Biotechnology has helped the traditional agricultural methods. In the last 10,000
years, people have used their knowledge to improve food production. Farmers used to
cross their plant to obtain features of interest. But this method was highly unproductive since a lot of effort was placed in obtaining a desired feature.

Genetic modification is a more efficient and accurate tool that has allowed scientists to
find the specific gen they need for a particular trait. Later on, this gen could be
cloned and introduced to a plant which would get the desirable characteristic.

It´s not that easy for the plant to express the desirable feature, even so,
genetic modification has allowed the next advances:
• Plants resistant to insects.
• Resistant stems harsh climates
• Higher yields of production 
To get more information, visit actionbioscience.org and read the article: Biotechnology in
crops: Issues for the developing world, and Crop Biotechnology: Feeds for livestock from
the university of California.

<B>
Fact: No genetically modified organism is released if it doesn’t comply with the
regulation required.</B>
In the United States, the regulation of genetically engineered (GE) foods is
divided among three federal agencies: the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
(oversees GE crop field trials); the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(for
selectable marker genes and proteins in crop development); the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) (conducts voluntary consultations on other aspects of GE
foods with the companies that choose to consult it). For more information
about these agencies, please consult the review <A href="http://www.saveourseeds.org/downloads/schubert_safety_reg_us_11_2004.pdf"> Safety Testing and Regulation of
Genetically Engineered Foods </A> in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Reviews.

In Mexico, the regulation is based on the Mexican
Constitution that establishes the general guidelines to be followed by
government dependencies. 

Some examples are: 
•Ley General de Salud (Health General Law)
•Ley Federal de Sanidad Vegetal (Federal Law of Vegetal Sanity)
•Ley federal sobreMetrología y Normalización (Federal Law about Metrology and Normalization)
•Ley Federal sobre Producción, Certificación y Comercio de Semillas (Federal Law about Production, Certification and Trade of Seeds)
• Normas OficialesMexicanas (NOM) (Official Mexican Standards).
An important law that regulates most of the crops in Mexico is the Ley de
Bioseguridad de Organismos Genéticamente Modificados (Biosecurity Law for
Genetically Modified Organisms). This law regulates the activities of confine
employ, experimental, pilot program and commercial release, marketing,
import and export of GM organism.
 For more information, you can consult it <A href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LBOGM.pdf"> here</A> For more information about Biotechnology and Biosecurity in Mexico check the review of the Mexican
Congress <A href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/cronica57/contenido/cont13/anali5.htm">here</A><B>Myth: The production of resistant crops to pests and weeds will create immune “super
insects”.</B><B>Reality: </B>There is no scientific study that suggests this scenario may happen as a result of
a genetically engineered crop production. Even so, there are a plenty of systems to
prevent this scenario: crop rotation, hybrid rotation, and pest integral manage. Insects
and weeds are not the same as they were in the past, but biotechnology could potentially improve
their management so they do not gain a resistant.

To get more info see: Crop rotation form Penn State university and the site oisat.org
<B>Myth: The crops produces by biotechnology will have a negative impact on the
environment.</B>
The origin of the myth is based in the conviction that the genetically modified
(GM) crops promote insects’ resistance and affect the soil.
<B>
Fact</B>: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) cause some positive impacts. According to the Journal of
Agrobiotechnology Management &amp; Economics, GMO have benefits related to the
changes of insecticide and herbicide use and the reduction of greenhouse gases.

(GHG) emission levels. The use of genetically modified organisms has resulted
in 224 million kg less pesticide use and a 15.3% reduction in the environmental
impact associated with pesticide use. The GM crops also contribute in the
reduction of GHG emissions of 9 billion kg in 2005, equivalent to removing 4
million cars from the roads. For more information about this study, click <A href="http://www.agbioforum.org/v9n3/v9n3a02-brookes.htm">here</A>.

An example of the employment of Biotechnology to substitute the use of
pesticides, are the transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis toxins.
B. thuringiensis is a bacterium that produce a toxin that has been used as
insecticide and as a natural regulator of insects. In accordance with an article of
Nature Biotechnology journal, these organisms have also the capacity to delay
insects’ resistance evolution in the plants.

<B>
Myth: The long-term effects produced by biotechnological generated food are unknown.</B><B>Reality</B>: A lot of years of research have allowed scientists to know the enormous
benefits that biotechnological food provides. The scientific consensus says that the risks
associated with foods derived from biotechnology are fundamentally the same as the 
other food products. Current science shows that foods produced through biotechnology are
safe for consumption and there are a plenty of regulatory authorities like the FDA,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and EPA that have determined that these products are
safe.

<B>Controversy on Stem Cells</B>
Stem cells have been an object of interest for many biotechnology researchers. Stem cells are cells that can divide
and differentiate into diverse cells types. They have potential to treat tumors, tissue regeneration, diabetes,
Parkinson, neuronal regeneration and hearth attacks. 

The controversial discussion around stem cells is because of their origin. In the beginning, they came from 
embryos which were destroyed after the cells were obtained. The problem is that life begins once the embryo is fertilized.

What most people don’t know is that there are different types of stem cells: Embryonic
and Adult. The embryonic stem cells are obtained from a fertilized embryo; meanwhile,
adult stem cells are obtained from other sources such as teeth, bone marrow and umbilical
cords. These type of cells could be used to avoid controversy and they may also be used in
therapeutic treatments.
