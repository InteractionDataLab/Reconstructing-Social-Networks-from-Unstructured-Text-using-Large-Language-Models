One of our human practice achievements is the “Augmented Reality Biobrick Software” in which the technology, science and a little bit of fun are combined. Our software is useful tool both for iGEMers and non-iGEMers as an interactive option to teach and learn more about the synthetic biology. During the iGEM competition, the iGEMers can use this software to build up their genetic constructs with a user-friendly-interphase that can store 3D symbolic models of constructions. As a teaching tool it can be used as representations of biobricks in a more immersive way, being able not only to control the buildup of genetic constructions but also to learn about the interactions between prefixes and suffixes.
If you want to build your biobricks in a new and entertaining way you only need a webcam and to follow these simple instructions!
1.- Download and install ".exe" file (Biotecnologia.exe)
2.- Download and print ".pdf" file in black and white (save ink!)
3.- Cut the printed figures, they represent the parts for the construct
4.- Once "Biotecnologia.exe" is running, place the figures in webcam view, you'll be able to see them on screen.
5.- Find the image representing a Plasmid backbone.
6.- Next, select another part to add, whether it is a promoter, a ribosome binding site, a coding sequence, or even a terminator. In order to do so, you must put a part next to the plasmid backbone image and wait for a few seconds to begin assembling.
7.- Place the parts in the order you want and capture your construct in a ".jpg" file for further reviewing.
If you need to delete a part click on it and then delete.
If you want to save the image click on save and you will have your construct ready.
If you have any questions, send us an email!
Augmented Reality creates a mix between reality and a 3D computer program, by taking information from the physical world, a computer or any other electronic device is able to complement what you are seeing or hearing with multimedia information. Some programs let you interect with them, other show small animation sequences but all of them exploit the boundaries between reality and CG graphics.
We thank a lot Engineer Pablo Guillermo Ramírez Flores and Engineer Héctor Eduardo Ramírez from the "Center for Knowledge Systems" (Centro de Sistemas de Conocimientos) for helping us create this program. We think your world and ours have so many differences that can be joined to create magic!
