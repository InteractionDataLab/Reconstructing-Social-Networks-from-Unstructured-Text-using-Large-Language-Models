1- Escherichia coli
2- Transcription is inhibited by araC protein
3- Arabinose interacts with the araC protein leaving the PBAD promoter side available for RNA polymerase
4- The same will occur with our second construct on a different E.coli
5- Traduction is finished and due to our signal peptide the polypeptide chain is sent to the periplasm
6- Periplasm folding occurs generating a β-barrel domain of autotransporter protein and it transports enzymes, still functional outside the cell
