Our third construct ompA+sacC has the same promoter as the last two (PBAD promoter, BBa_K206000 , and its repressor protein araC, BBa_I13458 ) We decided to use an already reported part, membrane protein ompA and a signal peptide of lpp ( BBa_K103006 ). We decided to try out our extracellular invertase “sacC” ( BBa_K633003 ) cloned out of Zymmomonas Mobilis in our university. The importance behind this part is that it’s a monomeric enzyme, able to produce both glucose and fructose from sucrose, an important approach for inverted sugar.
