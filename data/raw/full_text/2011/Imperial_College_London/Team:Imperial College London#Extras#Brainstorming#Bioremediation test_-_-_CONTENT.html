The activity of this fungus is affected by C:N ratio, lignin content, pH of water, temperature, and abundance of nutrients (i.e. O2).

Leaves will decompose into an excellent organic soil amendment that can be used as a soil conditioner. -The decomposition process is slow (i.e. leaves require 5 months to 2 years to decompose), could combine with Nick’s gene expression amplification? -However, rapid decomposition would consume a large amount of O2 and create anaerobic conditions.

Hydrogen has more potential energy than petrol. Hence, food waste can be turned into valuable energy. Fermentative bacteria use carbohydrates like sugar to produce hydrogen and acids. Purple bacteria, use light to produce energy (photosynthesis) and make hydrogen to help them break down molecules such as acids.<A href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080716204805.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080716204805.htm</A></P><P>-Hydrogen is produced by feeding waste products from a chocolate factory to Escherichia coli bacteria.

PAHs are released into the environment through processes like the combustion of fossil fuels, plastic, coke production and vehicle exhaust. PAHs can be found in air (cigarette smoke) and accumulate in soil. It can also be found in water due to industrial effluents and oil spills. The poor water solubility of PAH causes it to be deposited in sediments and aquatic organisms, affecting fish farms, etc.</P><P>Solution: Factories release PAHs into water or ponds which affect survival of fishes in fish farm. Bacillus subtilis can break up the PAHs and eliminate this pollutant. In addition, the Bacillus also contains gene which codes for the production of vitamin which is beneficial to the growth of the fish. To exploit this benefit, we need to find a way for Zooplankton (found in aquatic environment) to incorporate the Bacillus and its vitamin-producing gene. The fish feeding on the zooplankton will then receive a good source of vitamin for its growth. To do this, we can engineer Bacillus bacteria to act as a vector which can deliver vitamin to the cytoplasms of zooplankton which is a phagocytic eukaryote. Essentially, this project allows us to not only clear up the pollutant PAH, but it also provides a source of nutrients for the fish. In addition, the waste product of the fish can also be used by the Bacillus to provide nutrients for the fish.</P><P>PAH or poly aromatic hydrocarbon has been one of the major water pollutant in many tropical countries due to incorrect water waste regulation in the plastics and fuel industry. Its carcinogenicity is considered highly toxic to both human and the river creatures and hence causes major health and agricultural problem. PAH primarily accumulates inside the soil and contaminates the plankton on the riverbed. The toxicity is transmitted as the fish eat the plankton and is eaten by human respectively. Our idea is to convert this highly dangerous substance into a useful product where PHA ,polyhydroxyalkaonate, since it uses the same precursor that could be broken down by PAH, acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA. PHA is also biodegradable, thereby safe for environment, has higher elasticity, strength and and thermal stability than polyethelene and polypropylene, the non-biodegradable plastics using in everyday-life.</P><P>The solution is by engineering the bacteria that can convert the PAH to acetylCoA using the mechanism below. The bacteria can sense the breakdown of catechol which will acts as a transcription activator for the expression of AHL, allows the aggregation of the bacteria to promote PAH breakdown into acetyl CoA and sucinyl CoA. Another module that is incorporated into the bacteria are the genes responsible for PHA production as well as the gas vesicle protein and RFP. Therefore after collecting the plastics (density = 1.48 g/ml &gt; water density) The bacteria can float up and will be easily detected. Eventually the plastic producing bacteria could be collected for plastics extraction and the region contaminated by PAH could be identified where more bacteria could be applied for more breakdown.</P><P><A href="#Top">Back to top</A></P><DIV class="printfooter">
