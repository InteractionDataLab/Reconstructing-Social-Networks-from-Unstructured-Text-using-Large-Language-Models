Week 15: 10th October to 16th October
Monday, 10th October
Chris continued his never-tiring efforts to assemble Gene Guard. Nick got back to work on Phyto Route. Frank prepared his next Radio iGEM episode. Si and Nina worked on their data fitting experiment while Ming looked after his plants and Rebekka looked into organising Dendra2 imaging.
Tuesday, 11th October
Working, working, working

Friday, 14th October
Another Friday, another meeting. Things are not going as fast as we would like them to go and we decide that working harder is probably the solution. And another weekend is sacrificed onto iGEM work.
