With the sad news that James is still in hospital we started to work again. After a meeting with the advisors on  Friday, we were now ready to brainstorm again about many more ideas. In the morning we went to Queens Lawn to enjoy a bit of sunshine to help us thinking. After a while some of the ideas were formed. At noon we had a talk about DNA assembly and a after a quick lunch we split into groups and continue developing our ideas (you can find them on the brainstorming page). Before finishing for the day, we all presented some of the points and ideas, discarded some and kept some for further investigation. Tomorrow we hope to see James among us and brainstorm some more. </P><P>DNA assembly presentation: </P><P>DNA assembly can kill projects if done incorrectly. It takes around 3 days   for 1 assembly: Day 1: Start cultures Day 2: Assemble Day 3: Screen (might take   more than one day). </P><P>Assembly day: Miniprep ~30 mins. Extract part ~75-135 mins. Purify part ~90   mins. Assemble (make flanking sequences single stranded and mix and anneal)   ~75-135 mins. Transform ~60 mins. ~6.5 hours! That is being optimistic! </P><P>Two techniques: Short Overlap (BioBricks)- Maximum two parts at the same   time. Long overlap (Gibson/User) - Safely assemble 5 parts, theoretically 10. </P><P>Short: Miniprep --&gt; Restriction digest --&gt; Gel extract --&gt;   Ligate--&gt; Transform All parts submitted must be in this format. Can use the   parts from miniprep a maximum of around 4 times. ~6 bp overhang. Low Tm (~10   degrees celsius). Ligase works best at 37 degrees celsius though. Need to   compromise between both these parameters. </P><P>Long: Miniprep --&gt; PCR --&gt; DpnI digest + purify or gel extract --&gt;   Assembly reaction--&gt; Transform PCR primer could work first time or take weeks   to get to work due to possibilities of non-specific binding and other errors   that can occur with an inadequate primer. Gibson ~40bp overhang while User ~20bp   overhang. User require a uracil for every 7th base. Uracils are expensive bases   to buy. Gibson still work for DNA fragments down to ~91bp. Need to be careful   that they're not too much shorter. </P><P>Part insulation: If 2 ORF's are next to each other one might transcribe into   another. Solve through three methods: 1: Place a terminator in between. Problem   is that if there are too many terminators with the same sequence, deletions   might occur. Check Biofab IS website for different terminators. 2: Face parts   away from each other. 3: Spacing them away from each other. However,   read-through is very long. </P><P>Reusable parts: BioBricks allows us to reuse parts easily. Can this be done   with the Long overhang methods? Prefix and suffix attached to GOI. Use linkers.   Depending on linker we attach one GOI to another in whatever orientation and   order we want. </P><P>Libraries: Three types: Mutants, Mutagenomics and Rational design. Sources:   Other labs/registries, epPCR, degenerate synthesis. </P><H3>Tuesday, 12th July</H3><P>Today we continued brainstorming and came up with a few   new ideas but had to scrap a few that are not feasible.</P><P>1.       Spores &amp; rain</P><OL><BLOCKQUOTE><P>a.       Need an application, not just making rain</P><P>b.      Empty virus capsid instead of spore?</P></BLOCKQUOTE></OL><P><S>2.       Mucin on plants</S></P><OL><BLOCKQUOTE><P>a.       On   surface of leaves, yeast could produce mucin coat if it gets very hot to avoid   water loss</P><P>b.      How   does light interact with mucin?

We came up   with various themes so as to help us in the generation of ideas. More new ideas   were produced and some of yesterday's ideas were further developed. We came up   with the following list of 8 ideas at the end of the day. 1) Bacterial solar   cell 2) Auxin-secreting bacteria 3) Termite enzymes converting wood to sugar 4)   Degradation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon 5) Bacteria-targeting nematodes   6) Oestrogenic endocrine disrupters in waste water 7) Filling in the green gap 8)   Anammox bacteria to treat eutrophication Among these, the most promising and   favourite ones are idea 2, 3 and 5. We will continue to focus and developed on   these ideas. As for the rest of the ideas, we might look further into them. But   if nothing can be developed from there, we will discard them and come up with   more new ideas. </P><H3>Thursday, 14th July</H3><P>Day 9 Entry (14th/July/2011) </P><P>Morning:- </P><P>- More brainstrorming </P><P>- Came up with the following 9 ideas: Chris - Termites: turning cellulose into sugar; Frank - Auxin-secreting bacteria; Si - dodecane into primary alcohol; Nick - photosynthetic bacteria and ATP production; Ming - PHA into PAH; Rebekka - treatment of oestrogen in waste water; Nikki - nematodes; Nina &amp; Yuanwei - cellulose breakdown library with the enzyme from rabbit cecum Hamiltonian path problem and network alignment </P><P>- Finally, Nina and Yuanwei's ideas were shut down since: 1. The cellulose-breakdown idea is the same as the termites one. 2. The Hamiltonian path and DNA computing idea is definitely worth thinking about to solve the protein-protein interaction problem, but it is too unrealistic for us. </P><P>Afternoon:- </P><P>- Presentation! Smooth and generally satisfying. </P><P>- Two ideas survived out of seven: Termites group: Chris, Rebekka, Si, Yuanwei and Nick; Auxin group: Frank, Ming, Nikki and Nina. </P><P>- Drink at union bar: Who is the next model for Ming ? Frank ? Goat and dude -   naughty :] Yuanwei - we will get you drunk next time. </P><P>Evening:- </P><P>- Dinner at Oriental Canteen. </P><P>- All of us went to the common room in James' hall to prepare for the presentation tomorrow. </P><P>- Presentation key points: 1. Title 2. Problem: background introduction 3. Project description 4. Previous iGem projects 5. Genetic circuits 6. Modelling   7. Experiments 8. Human practice 9. Safety , security and ethics.</P><H3>Friday, 15th July</H3><P>Today, we prepared presentations on the two selected project proposals to the   professors and Claire and Susanna from LSE. </P><P>After much back and forth and cake, we decided that project auxin was   superior to project termite. Happiness ensued. </P><DIV class="printfooter">
