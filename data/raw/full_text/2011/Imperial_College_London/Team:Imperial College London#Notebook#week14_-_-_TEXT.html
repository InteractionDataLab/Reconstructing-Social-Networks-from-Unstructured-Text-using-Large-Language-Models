Week 14: 3rd October to 9th October
Monday, 3rd October
What a weekend! Happy and exhausted, the team have returned to London with some lucky few exploring still exploring Amsterdam while the rest of us return to lectures.
Tuesday, 4th October
There are so many things to be done. So many things we want to do. But where to start? The team started organising itself and the first few emails were sent out to arrange imaging, mass spectrometry and other experiments.
Wednesday, 5th October
Working hard
Thursday, 6th October
Still working hard
Friday, 7th October
We held a big meeting and discussed what we want to get done by the time we go to Boston. Gene Guard assembly is a big priority and we want to do some more imaging of Dendra2-expressing bacteria to see if the bacteria are metabolically active inside the roots. The modellers are keen on doing some more data fitting. Yuanwei's list of things to do on the wiki never gets smaller. It's because we love him.
There are so many things to do!
