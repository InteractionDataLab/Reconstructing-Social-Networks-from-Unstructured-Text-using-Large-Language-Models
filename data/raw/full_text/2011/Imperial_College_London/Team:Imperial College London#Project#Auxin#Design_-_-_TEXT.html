Module 2: Auxin Xpress
Auxin, or Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), is a plant growth hormone which is produced by several soil bacteria. We have taken the genes encoding the IAA-producing pathway from Pseudomonas savastanoi and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Following chemotaxis towards the roots and uptake by the Phyto Route module , IAA expression will promote root growth with the aim of improving soil stability .

Design
IaaM and IaaH have been codon optimized for both Bacillus subtilis and E. coli through the use of our own codon optimizing software. Also, the genes have been placed under the pVEG promoter which works in B. subtilis and E. coli and we calculated the RBS efficiency for both E. coli and B. subtilis. Furthermore, insulator sequences have been placed in front of the ribosome binding sites so that the genes could be placed under different promoters depending on desired output in different species.
