Roots secrete a variety of compounds that <I>E. coli</I> are not attracted to naturally. Accordingly, we engineered a chemoreceptor into our chassis that can sense malate, a common root exudate, so that it can swim towards the root. Additionally, <I>E. coli</I> are actively taken up by plant roots, which will allow targeted <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Auxin_Overview">IAA delivery</A> into roots by our system.</B></P><DIV class="underlinemenu"><UL><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Overview">Overview</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Specifications">Specifications</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Design">Design</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Modelling">Modelling</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Assembly">Assembly</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Testing">Testing &amp; Results</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Future">Future Work</A></LI></UL></DIV><H1>Testing</H1><P>Testing for chemotaxis can be split into qualitative and quantitative assays. Qualitative assays involve putting engineered <I>E. coli</I> and an attractant onto semi-solid agar plates and observe the movement of the microbes. If they can be observed to move towards the attractant source, they are likely to be attracted to the ligand. In quantitative assays, capillaries are filled with different concentrations of the attractant malate. Positive controls are provided by filling identical capillaries with different concentrations of serine, which <I>E. coli</I> naturally move towards. Negative controls are provided by filling capillaries with media that does not contain a source of attractant. The amount of bacteria that swim into each capillary is evaluated by FACS.</P><P> For simplicity, we will be working with Arabidopsis to observe the uptake of bacteria into plant roots.
Arabidopsis thaliana is a common plant model organism. It belongs to the mustard family and fulfils many important requirements for model organisms. As such, its genome has been almost completely sequenced and replicates quickly, producing a large number of seeds. It is easily transformed and many different mutant strains have been constructed to study different aspects (National Institute of Health, no date). While Arabidopsis may not represent plant populations naturally occurring in arid areas threatened by desertification, it is a handy model organism we will be using to study the effect of auxin on roots, observe chemotaxis towards them and look at uptake of bacteria into the roots.</P><P>We will be using Arabidopsis to look at the uptake of our engineered bacteria into the plants. For this, we will be using wild type Arabidopsis and E. coli that constitutively express green fluorescent protein. The natural fluorescence produced by plant roots and green fluorescence produced by the bacteria can be used to image the uptake of bacteria using confocal microscopy.</P><H2>1. Testing for chemotaxis towards malate</H2><P>Experiments involving chemotaxis can be split to two categories, qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative experiments, we are able to show that bacteria, which we study do or do not move towards a source, however it does not inform us at all about the cell count.</P><H2>5th of August - Agar plug in assay</H2><P>The simplest method for studying chemotaxis is to use agar plug in assay, which is a simple experimental method to show bacterial movement towards a localised chemical source.</P><P>Experiment is performed as follows, bacteria are added into the plate on one side, and the attractant to the other. Result is then the shape of the formed colony which grows into distorted elipse shape within the agar if the attractant is present, however colony shape remains circular if no attractant was added.</P><P> In our experiment we have used <I>5-α Escherichia coli</I> cells. Cells used as positive control were transformed with pSB1C3 plasmid backbone, which conferred chloramphenicol resistance. These cells have not been modified in any other way and were used to show <I>5-α E. coli</I> are capable of chemotaxis, using serine as attractant, which acts as a ligand for Tsr, an endogenous chemoreceptor. <I>5-α Escherichia coli</I> competent cells were also transformed with pRK415 a working plasmid with mcpS gene and tetracycline resistance. These cells express mcpS gene from <I>P. putida KT2440</I>, which is chemoreceptor with malate as its ligand, and therefore malate was used as attractant for these cells during agar plug in assay. As a negative control, no attractant was added into the plate.</P><P> Amount of attractant added contributes greatly towards the result, as too little attractant added will not stimulate bacteria to move towards source, however too much attractant will result in the saturation of the medium and the bacteria will not chemotax towards source. Values (concentration of attractant, distance between colony and attractant at start etc.), necessary to perform this experiment have been worked out using modelling. </P>
     These are the values of attractant concentration we have used, when 5µl sample was added into the plate:<TABLE class="MsoTableGrid" style="border-collapse:collapse;border:none;mso-border-alt:solid windowtext .5pt;

We imaged the plants incubated with 8ml of bacteria and were able to find bacteria inside one of the roots. A 3D picture was taken of uninfected roots and roots containing bacteria by taking a Z stackk image using confocal microscopy. </P><P><I>This video shows an image put together from successive images taken at different depth levels. The GFP-expressing bacteria are clearly visible within the root.</I></P><P>We also imaged roots that did not contain bacteria via a similar Z-stack scan. This image is shown below.</P><P>We repeated this experiment at a later date with plants that had been allowed to grow for a longer period of time. The bacteria were predominantly found in root hairs and inside of cells on the root surface.</P><H3>3. Tracking of cell viability using Dendra</H3><P>Dendra-expressing bacteria were also taken up into plant roots. Using a confocal microscope, we photoconverted the Dendra protein from green to red fluorescence. Conversion with the 405nm laser was completed after about 15 rounds of bleaching at 50% laser intensity with the pinhole set to 3 airy units.</P><P><I>Dendra photoconversion in bacteria taken up inside plant roots. 1 is the area photoconverted using the 405nm laser. 2 is an individual bacterium whose Dendra protein has undergone photoconversion. 3 is a negative control consisting of a non-photoconverted bacterium. The bacteria found inside the roots can be seen on the right. The data on the left displays the conversion from green to red fluorescence for the highlighted areas. Ch2: emission in green spectrum. Ch3: emission in red spectrum. ChD: brightfield emission.</I></P><DIV class="printfooter">
