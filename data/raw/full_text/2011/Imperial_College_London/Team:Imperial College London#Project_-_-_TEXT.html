Abstract
Desertification and top soil erosion are major problems in arid areas where rainfall is infrequent. When it arrives it falls very hard, washing away top soil that is unprotected by foliage. Over-farming and deforestation are the major culprits as the roots that hold the soil down are removed.
The goal of this project is to build a microbial based delivery system that will take advantage of auxin's morphogenic abilities and tackle the issue through the medium of plants. We are looking into the use of roots to stabilize the soil.
