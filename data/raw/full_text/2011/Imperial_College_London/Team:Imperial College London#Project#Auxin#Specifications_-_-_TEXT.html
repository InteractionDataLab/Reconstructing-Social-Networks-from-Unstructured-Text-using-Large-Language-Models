Module 2: Auxin Xpress
Auxin, or Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), is a plant growth hormone which is produced by several soil bacteria. We have taken the genes encoding the IAA-producing pathway from Pseudomonas savastanoi and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Following chemotaxis towards the roots and uptake by the Phyto Route module , IAA expression will promote root growth with the aim of improving soil stability .

Specifications
The IAM pathway taken for this module is from Pseudomonas savastanoi. This strain of soil dwelling bacteria is a known plant pathogen that uses IAA to infect its target. However, there have been some recent studies that suggest that IAA secretion by bacteria can also lead to positive microbe-plant relations [1]. Therefore, we must carefully analyze what IAA concentration would aid root growth rather than promote gall formation. To achieve this, we will be experimenting with different levels of synthetic auxin on Arabidopsis thaliana. We will also be modelling this module in order to obtain the adequate concentration of IAA excretion from the chassis.
