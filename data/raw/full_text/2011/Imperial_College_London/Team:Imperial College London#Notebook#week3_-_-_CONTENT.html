Ming, totally out   of the blue, shows up with some phytogels that he seeded with Arabidopsis, a   fantastic start to any plant project. 
  Nikki and Frank went over the   presentation 3 or 4 times until it was ready to give to the team from BBC’s   Horizon at 11:30. In the meantime, everyone hit the research hard, looking for   genes and setting up appointments to speak to experts. 
  At 2pm we moved into   our new labs in the Sir Alexander Fleming building, where we got a brief safety   introduction and began ordering the equipment we were likely to need in the   coming weeks. Claire from LSE sent over a list of questions that we have to take   into consideration for the human practices aspect of our project. 
  Nina, Yuanwei and Si also got started on some modelling, doing some   pretty impressive MatLab stuff whilst the rest of us started designing   experiments that would be needed to test our system, module by module. Nikki   also got started on emailing newspapers and magazines as part of our outreach   goals. </P><H3>Tuesday, 19th July</H3><P>Ming and Rebekka met Thorsten Hamann to discuss how to grow Arabidopsis in   liquid culture. A problem will be organising DR5 seeds but hopefully someone   will be able to help us out. They also got an induction to the plant facilities   at Imperial and will hopefully be ready to start seeding soon!
  Lab   supplies were organised and ordered and will hopefully arrive soon.
  The   auxin and chemotaxis teams are working on the genetic constructs and should have   them ready by tomorrow morning. Most of the optimisation is now done and   sequences are almost ready to be ordered.
  The chemotaxis team met with   the local chemotaxis expert and got some valuable modelling advice and some   general context for the chemotaxis issue. Modelling the feedback loop in   chemotaxis is now a lot more advanced.
  A couple of us met CJ from the   Royal College of Art to discuss design and outreach options for the project. She   and Koby will be working with us and we are looking forward to their artistic   input! </P><H3>Wednesday, 20th July</H3><P>Arabidopsis team : Ming and Rebekka were informed that the DR5-GFP seed was   available at ABRC. Rebekka continued her human practise discussion and assigned   different tasks to the team while Ming was preparing liquid media and   sterilizing WT arabidopsis seeds for seeding in the next day. ~ Thanks to P'   Khaow ; Ms Issariya who has helped us with the protocol and the wetlab. :) 
  Auxin team : Chris and Nikki were finding the sequences in the morning   along with discussing about the project direction and cloning strategies. They   also looked for <I>Pseudomonas syringae</I> and found stock at retail which needs to be   PCR'd if synthetic parts do not arrive 
  Chemotaxis team : Frank designed   the kill switch but not all parts were available. He also designed the agar   plate assay and work on a capillary chemotaxis assay. Nick was working on a gene   construct where he figured out the RBS sequences, optimised sequences, generated   constructs in serial cloner, and join human practise talk with Rebekka. 
  Modelling team : Nina and Si used Matlab to model the distribution   pattern of malate and citrate concerning initial concentrations and   concentrations at different distances. Also they were progressing on the   chemotaxis pathway modelling.
  Wiki : Yuanwei re-designed the team page and uploaded   more photos.</P><H3>Thursday, 21st July</H3><P>Arabidopsis team: Rebekka has been doing some research on human practices.   Claire's e-mail has been very helpful in that it has allowed us to see that   containment is not the only option that should be considered. We will be trying   to also consider what effects our bacteria might have if containment fails. Ming   finished seeding the Arabidopsis seeds into the liquid media. He also did some   research with Nikki on soil erosion in Asia as well as some research into the MB   aspect of human practices (how GM bacteria might affect other bacterial   populations).
  Auxin team: Nikki did some research on soil erosion and   desertification. She also worked on the second version of the project   description and also started preparing the progress report presentation that was   due on the following day. Chris worked on the DNA sequences for the auxin module   as well as for the Dendra2 gene. These sequences should also be sent for   synthesis early next week.
  Chemotaxis team: Nicolas was working on the   chemotaxis module's DNA sequences to be sent off for synthesis early next week.   Meanwhile, Frank tried to design experiments to perform for the chemotaxis   module as well as working on a kill switch for the bacteria. He was playing with   the idea of using a UV sensitive promoter for it.
  Modelling team: Si and   Nina met Dr. Endres to talk about modeling chemotaxis. They then made a model   for single cell chemotaxis and found out that the bacteria reacts optimally to   10-6M malate concentrations.
  Wiki: Yuanwei continued to work hard on the   wiki. We agreed on how the wiki should be organised and Yuanwei will upload the   cool new menu very soon.</P><H3>Friday, 22nd July</H3><P>We had presentation update for Professor Kitney and he provided us with a   number of relevant points, which will help us to further improve the project. 
  Arabidopsis team: Rebekka has continued research into the human practice.   Ming was continuing seeding Arabidopsis. 
  Auxin team: Nikki was working   mainly on the presentation and then continued researching our problem of   soil erosion and desertification. Chris, James and Dr Ellis were finalising   sequences for order, particularly RBS sequences, which they were generating   using RBS Salis and Voigt calculators. 
  Chemotaxis team: Frank was helping   Nikki with the presentation and then was looking into inducible promoters for a   kill-switch, which we will have to introduce into our system. Nick was finalising   sequences for order, conrolling all the sequences for errors and illegal   restriction sites. 
  Modelling team: Nina and Si have continued modelling of   bacterial chemotaxis as a flux and have met Dr Siggers to talk about modelling   of chemotaxis. 
  Wiki: Yuanwei was working on the wiki as usual. </P><DIV class="printfooter">
