- Let competent cell strain 5α thaw for around 10 minutes on ice.
- Add 2-3μl of DNA.
- Leave on ice for 20-25 minutes.
- Heat shock cells at 42°C for 45 seconds.
- Leave on ice for 10 minutes.
- Add 500μl of LB broth.
- Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C.
- Centrifuge for 1 minute.
- Remove 100μl off the top of the eppendorf tube. Pour out the rest making sure that the pellet remains in the eppendorf tube.

- Add 5μl on a chloramphenicol agar plate (concentration of 35μg/ml).
- Add the rest of the sample to a second chloramphenicol agar plate.
</P><P><B>Antibiotics</B>:
Four different antibiotics (kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin &amp; tetracycline) have been used during the course of the project. They have been used in following working concentrations, unless stated otherwise:
- Kanamycin - 35µg/ml
- Chloramphenicol – 35µg/ml
- Tetracycline – 35 µg/ml
- Ampicillin – 100 µg/ml</P><P><B>Tryptone broth</B>
To make bacteria develop flagella they are grown in the tryptone broth. This is recipe for total volume of 1L:
- 10g tryptone
- 1000ml of 1X PBS
- autoclave
- add required amount of antibiotics</P><P><B>1x PBS</B>
Phosphate buffer saline is commonly used in chemotaxis experiments as wash buffer and can also be part of some media. This is a recipe for 1L:
- disolve following in 800ml of distilled H<SUB>2</SUB>O
- 8g of NaCl
- 0.2g of KCl
- 1.44g of Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>
- 0.24g of KH<SUB>2</SUB>PO<SUB>4</SUB>
- adjust pH to 7.4
- adjust volume 1L with additional distilled H<SUB>2</SUB>O
- autoclave
Note: also possibility to use 1X PBS tablets (one tablet per 200ml)
</P><P><B>Motility medium</B>
Some of chemotaxis assays require cells to be suspended in motility medium. This is recipe for total volume of 100ml:
- 0.1g of (NH<SUB>4</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>
- 1.044g of K<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>
- 0.00379g of EDTA
- autoclave
- after autoclaving add 18µl of 0.1M stock solution of FeSO<SUB>4</SUB></P><H2>5th of August</H2><P><B>Preparation before chemotaxis experiments</B></P><P>This is a procedure required to achieve optimum growth of flagellated bacteria that will move towards a source:
- Add required amount of antibiotic into LB broth (30 ml) before inoculation of bacteria.
- Inoculate cells into LB (30ml) and grow them at 30°C at low shaking 100 rpm overnight.
- Centrifuge overnight culture at 5000rpm for 10 minutes, and resuspend in 2 ml LB.
- Inoculate 1ml of resuspended cells into conical flask with 100ml LB.
- Grow at 30°C and low shaking 150 rpm, until middle of exponential phase is reached. 
- To obtain cells in mid-exponential phase, 100µl of growing cell culture is taken every 30 minutes and diluted with 900µl LB and absorbance is measured at OD<SUB>600</SUB> and graph is plotted. Once the gradient looks exponential (usually around OD<SUB>600</SUB> 0.4 - 0.6 after multiplying x10 due to dilution), cells are ready to use.
- Take 100ml of mid-exponential phase cell culture and centrifuge it down at 3000rpm for 20 minutes.
- Resuspend the centrifuged cells in 10ml of 1x PBS buffer. 
- Centrifuge resuspended cells at 3000rpm for 20 minutes. 
- Resuspend the centrifuged cells in 4ml of motility buffer. </P><P><B>Agar plug in experiment</B></P><P>- Take small circles of filter papers and soak it in the bacterial suspension obtained from the preparation before the experiment and insert into the semi – solid agar plate. Make sure not to insert bacteria too deep into the semi - solid agar since they might start to move using twitching motility on the surface and that is not the desired movement we require during chemotaxis assays. 
- Add 20µl of attractant on to another set of filter paper circles. Position these 2cm away from the bacterial circle on each of the semi - solid agar plates. 
- Leave bacteria to grow in the plates overnight at 30°C.</P><H2>18th of August</H2><P><B>M9 minimal medium semi - solid agar</B></P><P>In chemotaxis assays semi-solid agar is used as it allows greater diffusion of molecules and allows movement of bacteria within agar. This is recipe for total volume of 1L (dissolved in H<SUB>2</SUB>O):
- 12.8g of (Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>)7H<SUB>2</SUB>O or 6.76g Na<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>
- 3g of KH<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>
- 0.5g of NaCl
- 1g of NH<SUB>4</SUB>Cl
- adjust pH to 7.0 - 7.4
- add 20ml of 20% glycerol (other protocols might suggest addition of separately sterilised glycerol after autoclaving the salts, I do not do it, it still works)
- 2g agar
- autoclave
- cool down to 50°C in waterbath and add required antibiotics and separately sterilised solutions
- 2ml of 1M filter sterilised MgSO<SUB>4</SUB>
- 100µl of 1M filter sterilised CaCl<SUB>2</SUB>
- pour plates </P><P><B>Capillary assay</B></P><P> Prepare bacteria for chemotaxis. Load a number of 1ml syringes (this number depends on the number of attractant concentrations and a number of replicates that is going to be measured)

</P><H2>Seedling protocol</H2><P>- Weigh in appr. 50mg of arabidopsis seeds in eppendorf tube (one tube per 250 ml erlenmayer flask)

Variation in auxin concentrations is applied to see the sensitivity of auxin in arabidopsis. </P><P>- To test auxin sensitivity, Arabidopsis seeds were sown onto medium as given above and supplemented with 0, 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.01, 1, 100, 10000uM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). 
- Medium preparation and seed sowing occurred under 0.5 pE m-2 sec-l incandescent light to minimize
photooxidation of IAA.  
- Growing is done at 23°C in darkness for three days
- After 3 days, hypocotyl and root lengths were measured on 10 plantslreplication. Data were normalized to lengths as a percentage of the control treatment and subjected to analysis of variance.

Some notes
- Any work involving E coli will take place in the teaching labs and the plant growth room will only be used to grow plants in individual, sealed flasks: E coli will be added to media in the teaching labs and media change will also take place in the teaching labs to ensure containment of the bacteria. 
- To ensure that no E coli get into the water ways in the plant rooms, we will dispose of the bacteria in the teaching labs by filling them into flasks, applying vircon and autoclaving the solution </P><H2>Auxin concentration gradient effect on plants</H2><P>-prepare half-MS phytogels (see above)
-mark spots 2cm apart from each other where you are going to plant the seeds
-inject auxin dissolved in 70% ethanol at one of these points. The phytogel is very soft so you can inject the solution directly into the gel using a Gilson pipette. Use concentrations of 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01 mM of IAA.
-seed DR5 reporter line seeds at distances of 2cm, 4cm, 6cm, 8cm from the auxin.</P><H2>Split-root auxin uptake</H2><P>-prepare horizontally split plates. Pour regular half-MS phytogel into one half and phytogel containing 0.0001, 0.001 and 0.01mM phytogel into the other half. Pour only regular phytogel into the control plates.
-Take a DR5 reporter line seedling, previously grown in liquid culture and plant with one half of the roots in one half of the plate and the rest of the roots in the other half.</P><H1>Auxin Lab Protocols</H1><H2>27th of July</H2><P>The strain of E. coli with the copy of super-folded GFP that was incubated the previous night has shown limited/no growth in the prepared LB broth. This could have been caused by:
-No innoculation
-Kanamycin concentration in LB broth was too high. We had used 85μg/ml.<B>New protocol:</B>
50μg/ml is the recommended concentration. We will use 35-40μg/ml of kanamycin to speed up growth.

</P><H2>4th of August</H2><P>In order to make the stock solutions of the Salkowski reagent that was used for the PC method we mixed 100ml of 7.9M sulphuric acid with 1.49g of FeCl2.(4H2O). We called this mixture R1.
In order to make the stock solutions of the Salkowski reagent that was used for the S2/1 method we mixed 100ml of 10.8M sulphuric acid with 0.55g of FeCl2.(4H2O). We called this mixture R2.
The PC method allows us to measure Auxin levels of 0.2μg/ml to 20 μg/ml and is far more specific for IAA rather than other indoles.
</P><P><B>Salkowski reagent revised</B></P><P>
- 0.811g of anhydrous FeCl<SUB>3</SUB> is dissolved in 10ml H<SUB>2</SUB>O to obtain 0.5M solution

The S2/1 method allows us to measure a range from 2 μg/ml to 200 μg/ml but is less specific for IAA. In order to perform this experiment:
-Mix 500 μl of Trp supplemented LB broth (1 mg/ml) with 1000 μl of R1.
-Leave in dark at room temperature for 30 minutes.
-Measure OD at 554nm.
</P><H2>9th of August</H2><P>To prepare the E.Coli, media and soil for the survivability experiement:
-Make filter paper discs for soaking the media in.
-Transform E.Coli K-12 5α, with a high-copy plasmid containing a GFP expression.
-Innoculate colonies from the transformants into a 4ml LB media and incubate at 37°C and 225 rpm for a period of 5 hours. 
-Place 1g of soil into eppendorf tubes 60 times. Autoclave 30 tubes. 
-Pour bacteria into two 2ml eppendorf tubes, centrifuge and empty broth, ensuring pellet remains in the eppendorf tube.
-Re-suspend in 1ml LB.
