Data Page
This page shows a list of all the parts that we have made or used in the project. Click on the link for each part to see more details about that part on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . For a brief overview of our main results, please have a look at our Main Results page.
How our system works
Figure 1: Schematic diagram summarising our system. It consists of three modules: a chemotaxis module ( Phyto-Route ), an auxin-production module ( Auxin Xpress ) and ( Gene Guard ), a containment module (Diagram by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
Data for our favourite new parts
Main Page - Composite pVeg2 - IaaM - IaaH, BBa_K515100: We have shown that indole 3-acetic acid is being produced in our bacteria. In addition, we have exposed a mutant of Arabidopsis that expresses YFP in response to IAA to our auxin-producing bacteria. These plants were fluorescing more brightly than the controls.
Main Page - Composite p(tetR) R0040- RBS B0034- Dendra2, BBa_K515107: We have successfully expressed and photoconverted this protein in E. coli cells. In addition, we have photoconverted the protein inside bacterial cells that had been taken up into Arabidopsis roots using a confocal microscope.
Main Page - Composite J23100 promoter - PA2652, BBa_K515102: We have shown  that our bacteria respond to  L (-) malic acid through chemotactic behavior in comparison to cells that do not contain the construct. We have also quantified this response using capillary assay.
Data for pre-existing parts
Experience - p(TetR) mRFP - BBa_I13521 (Endy Lab, iGEM 2005): We have added the results of our thermostability assay to the experience page of this part.
Experience - p(TetR) GFP - BBa_I13522 (Endy Lab, iGEM 2005): We have added the results of our thermostability assay to the experience page of this part.
Parts we have improved
Experience - Part:BBa_K112808 (Berkeley, iGEM 2008) We have made anti-holin from the Berkeley 2008 lysis cassette available as a stand-alone BioBrick .
We've also created and characterised the following parts
Main Page - IaaM - tryptophan-2-mono-oxygenase, BBa_K515000: We have shown that indole 3-acetic acid is being produced in our bacteria. In addition, we have exposed a mutant of Arabidopsis that expresses YFP in response to IAA to our auxin-producing bacteria. These plants were fluorescing more brightly than the controls.
Main Page - Indoleacetamide hydrolase, BBa_K515001: We have shown that indole 3-acetic acid is being produced in our bacteria. In addition, we have exposed a mutant of Arabidopsis that expresses YFP in response to IAA to our auxin-producing bacteria. These plants were fluorescing more brightly than the controls.
Main Page - Regulatory pVeg2, BBa_K515010: We discovered that this part is functional and XylE is still expressed.
Main Page - Antiholin, BBa_K515004: We expressed anti-holin in E. coli cells.
Main Page - Composite J23100 promoter - Antiholin, BBa_K515104: We expressed anti-holin in E. coli cells.
Main Page - Coding Dendra2, BBa_K515007: We have successfully expressed and photoconverted this protein in E. coli cells. In addition, we photoconverted the protein inside bacterial cells that had been taken up into plant roots using a confocal microscope.
Main Page - Superfolder GFP (sfGFP), BBa_K515005: We expressed sfGFP and studied its thermostability. We also used it on the confocal microscope to image the uptake of E. coli into the roots.
Main Page - Composite J23100 promoter - sfGFP, BBa_K515105: We expressed sfGFP and studied its thermostability. We also used it on the confocal microscope to image the uptake of E. coli into the roots.
Main Page - PA2652, BBa_K515002: We did numerous assays to see whether the bacteria respond to malate. Our first behavioural analysis showed that there is an increase in tumbling frequency when malate is present and the cells are expressing PA2652. Chemotaxis towards malate was confirmed in a capillary-based assay.
Some of the parts are under construction
Main Page - Composite J23103 promoter - RBS B0034-RFP E1010 - Holin K112805 - endolysin K112806, BBa_K515106: due to the iterative nature of the Gene Guard assembly, this part was not completed in time.
