Determining IAA production levels in our construct</DIV><DIV class="thelanguage"><H3>1.1 Salkowski assay</H3><P>The Salkowski assay is a colourimetric assay that detects IAA with high specificity among other indoles. There are many different types of Salkowski reagents which work at different concentration ranges of IAA and with varying specificity. They all vary slightly in composition and measurement method. We used the most specific reagent according to a paper which works at a concentration range of 0 to 260 µM<SUP>[5]</SUP>. Modelling of the Auxin Xpress construct informed us that IAA production would be within this range. This standard assay is the simplest way to determine whether there is IAA present in solution. First we created a standard curve with increasing IAA concentration in LB broth using synthetic IAA <B>(Figure 1&amp;2)</B>. This was used to determine IAA concentration from OD measurements of IAA-producing <I>E. coli</I>. </P><P>The aim of this experiment was to determine whether our construct is working and roughly how much IAA we are producing when compared to control cells without the construct.</P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:520px;"><P><I>Figure 1: Standard curve of Salkowski assay made with synthetic IAA in LB.

Once IAA presence was confirmed by colour change, we set up a more thorough assay with a BMG Omega plate reader. The first assay we did was with <I>E. coli</I> DH5α <B>(Figure 3&amp;4)</B>, the results of which were positive for our IAA construct. The IAA producing <I>E. coli</I> were producing approximately 55 µM of IAA extracellularly. From modelling, we have determined that our construct would be able to produce 72.25 µM IAA intracellularly. <I>E. coli</I> are known to naturally produce IAA, which is why all of our controls show moderate levels of IAA production<SUP>[1]</SUP>.

In the assay comparing growth media (LB and tryptone broth) the OD of each sample, after 20 hours of incubation, was measured at 600 nm and appropriate dilutions of cell filtrate were made to normalise against the different cell densities of samples. The OD of cell filtrates after the addition of Salkowski reagent was measured at 530 nm and blanked with the appropriate growth medium mixed with Salkowski reagent for each sample. The OD measurements were then converted to IAA concentration with the standard Salkowski curve. Surprisingly, the results <B>(Figure 6)</B> suggest that IAA production was optimal in LB, although the OD at 600 nm of cultures grown in tryptone broth (very nutrient rich) was much higher. We cannot draw a conclusion from this data. However, it seems that the IAA producing pathway endogenous to <I>E. coli</I> is much more complicated than anticipated. We postulate that IAA is not produced when growth conditions are very favourable and cell density is high. </P><P>The final Salkowski assay we tried was with <I>E. coli</I> BL21 transformed with the Auxin Xpress construct. This strain has two proteases knocked out and is favourable for protein over-expression. We left the liquid cultures to incubate in the dark for 20 hours and then measured OD as previously described. From this assay we got extremely high yields of IAA (shown by the bright red colour after addition of Salkowski reagent to cell filtrate, <B>Figure 7</B>) in the Auxin Xpress and control cells. We think that the assay was saturated and therefore we will need to test the supernatant with HPLC.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:420px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 7: Salkowski assay of filtered supernatant from IAA expressing </I>E. coli<I> BL21 and control competent </I>E. coli<I> BL21 that have not been transformed.

The effect of IAA on <I>Arabidopsis</I> roots</DIV><DIV class="thelanguage"><H3> 2.1 Confocal imaging with fluorescent reporter cell lines </H3><P>We are not only interested in constructing the IAA-producing pathway in our bacteria but we also want to investigate what effect the IAA has on plants to verify our assumptions about the effects of indole 3-acetic acid (IAA). This will help us with the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Human_Legal"><B>human practices aspect of our project</B></A>, as it is part of product safety testing, and it will also provide a good assay for the functionality of IAA-secreting bacteria.</P><P>To observe how IAA influences plants, we will be working with the plant model organism <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>. <I>Arabidopsis</I> is well-established for research into plant biology and researchers have established lines that respond to IAA exposure by expressing reporter genes, which are particularly useful for our project. </P><P>We used DR5:3XVENUS plants that respond to IAA by expression of YFP to look at the plant response to synthetic IAA and bacteria-secreted IAA. This will allow us to monitor how much IAA is taken up and which cells respond to it. We will be using confocal microscopy to image and evaluate the relative strength of fluorescence expressed by the plant. This type of imaging is especially useful as it makes three-dimensional imaging of samples possible thanks to precise imaging of individual points. The fluorescence  acted as an indirect reporter on the IAA concentration supplied as it relies on the plant expressing fluorescence in response to stimulation by the hormone. </P><H3>2.2 Effect of IAA produced by our bacteria</H3><P>Once we had engineered our bacteria to express IAA, we an experiment to investigate the IAA's effect on the roots. This was done by supplying the plants with bacteria that produce IAA. Plants that were not exposed to bacteria showed strong autofluorescence in response to the IAA naturally produced in the roots. However, the roots supplied with bacteria unable to express IAA only exhibited very weak fluorescence. Plants supplied with IAA-expressing bacteria were brighter than either of the two controls. Imaging was carried out at precisely the same settings to ensure that the data could be compared and is representative of actual fluorescence.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:600px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Video 1. Response of the roots to IAA-expressing bacteria.

The relative fluorescence intensity of roots exposed to our auxin-secreting bacteria is 1.93x that of roots exposed to no bacteria and 2.9x that of roots exposed to non-auxin-expressing bacteria. It therefore appears that bacteria normally suppress production of IAA in root tips. However, the bacteria we have engineered to express IAA produce enough of the compound to not only overcome this limitation but to also increase expression of the reporter gene.</P><H3>2.3 Effect of synthetic IAA</H3><P>We exposed <I>Arabidopsis</I> seedlings to different concentrations of synthetic IAA.

In our experiments, we initially tested the effect of IAA concentrations of 0.1 nM - 10 mM. Unfortunately, our negative control (seedling with no additional auxin) got infected by a fungus preventing us from determining whether IAA could enhance root growth. Analysis of the uninfected seedlings revealed that increasing IAA resulted in decreased root growth. 



In response to this finding, we repeated the experiment with an extended IAA range of 0.01 pm - 10 mM. 

Within this extended range, we were able to find the optimum concentration of IAA for enhanced root growth. 


Seedlings were grown for three days and imaged using a Fujifilm LAS3000 Imager.

We can use this value to optimise IAA production by our Auxin Xpress construct by switching the promoter and RBS without surpassing the threshold value. The root branching could not be determined by the Imager since the plants were to small to observe.

On these gels, individual seedlings grow horizontally into a gel containing plant nutrients. These gels enable us to supply the plant with IAA at set distances from the seedling itself. From these experiments we hoped to determine whether our IAA producing bacteria will have an effect on plant root growth from around the root in the soil without being taken up by the root. We used DR:3VENUS seeds. These germinate into plants whose roots respond to IAA by expressing YFP. </P><P>From modelling we estimated the level of IAA secretion from our bacteria to be 10<SUP>11</SUP> fM. Accordingly, we added three different IAA concentrations ranging from 10<SUP>8</SUP> fM to 10<SUP>10</SUP> fM IAA at five distances ranging from 2 to 10 cm from the seed.(IAA was applied on the left side) Five replicates were set up for each concentration. The roots grew perpendicular to the line on which IAA and <I>Arabidopsis</I> seeds were applied. The phytogel plates were kept in the dark and at 4°C for three days in order to prevent the degradation of IAA. They were then transferred into light for another six days to observe root growth. After nine days total, the phytogel plates were imaged and root lengths measured.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:720px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 14: Phytogel plates applied with IAA concentrations of (a) 10<SUP>10</SUP> fM (10 µM), (b) 10<SUP>9</SUP> fM (1 µM), (c) 10<SUP>8</SUP> fM (0.1 µM) and (d) control (0M) from left to right.

(Data by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).</I></P></DIV><P>These results (Figure 15) suggest that IAA can have a promoting effect on root growth in close proximity to the seed, as well as at distances further away. Accordingly, whether our system promotes or inhibits root growth is influenced both by the position of the bacteria relative to the root and the amount of IAA produced by the bacterial population. Future optimisation of IAA production levels therefore depends on the affectivity of the Phyto-Route module and how close to the root our bacteria would swim in the soil and whether uptake into the roots would take place in nature. In future iterations of the design cycle, this data could influence both Phyto-Route and Auxin Xpress. </P><H3>2.6 The split root experiment </H3><P>To visually compare the difference of the root growth with and without IAA supplementation, we set up a split root experiment as recommended to us by Dr Alexandru Milcu.
This experiment extends beyond the scope of normal controls because the same plant is subjected to two different treatments in phytogel. We grew one half of the seedlings in phytogel containing three different concentrations of IAA and the other half in phytogel without IAA. Three replicates of seven day old <I>Arabidopsis</I> DR:3VENUS were set up for each concentration and grown for two weeks before measuring root length (Figure 17) </P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:720px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 16: The split plates applied with IAA concentration of (a) 10<SUP>10</SUP> fM (10 µM), (b) 10<SUP>9</SUP> fM (1 µM), (c) 10<SUP>8</SUP> fM (0.1 µM) and (d) and 10<SUP>5</SUP> 0.1 nM.

To get an accurate growth rate which is particularly fitting to our project, we decided to do data fitting analysis to the <I>Arabidopsis</I> we plant. The root length and number of branches of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> were recorded every two days from day 0 to day 9. Root length, daily root growth rate and number of branches are plotted against time and IAA concentration.

How IAA can improve soil stability</DIV><DIV class="thelanguage"><H3> 3.1 Soil erosion experiment  </H3><P>Promoting root growth to anchor top soil is the main objective of our project. We set up a soil erosion experiment to evaluate the effect of IAA on <I>Arabidopsis thaliana's</I> ability to hold down soil. In particular, we wanted to know which concentration of IAA causes <I>A. thaliana</I> to retain the most soil. We exposed plants to different IAA concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM (10<SUP>11</SUP> fM) to 10 fM. Fifteen plants were seeded per pot and two replicates were set up for each concentration. We chose to plant our seeds in M2 compost which consists of organic compost and sand. This compost was chosen to minimise errors resulting from different soil mixtures.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:900px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 24: Experimental set up (A) 3 pots of </I>Arabidopsis<I> watered with 3 different IAA concentrations : 0.1 pM (left), 10 nM (middle), and 1 mM (right) (B) Set up of </I>Arabidopsis<I> growing in preparation for the erosion experiment.(Data by Imperial College London iGEM team 2011).
</I></P></DIV><P>The effect of IAA can be seen at a very early stage. We observed the germination of the seeds that had been exposed to different IAA concentrations (Figure 25 and 26).</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:900px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 25: Germination speed and effectivity is affected by the by external auxin concentrations.

The growth trend caused by differing IAA concentrations in soil is quite similar to that observed in liquid media. However the ideal IAA concentration for plant growth is higher in soil than in liquid media (1 nM rather than 0.1 nM).</P><P>We allowed the plants to grow for four weeks and then looked at the effect of IAA on <I>Arabidopsis</I>. More specifically, we wanted to look at whether there would be a difference in water retention within the soil. The water mass was obtained by measuring the difference between the ratio of the wet soil mass and the dry soil mass right after the <I>Arabidopsis</I> was watered and 3 days after being watered. The results are shown below .</P><DIV class="newouterbox"><H4 class="newtext">NEW SINCE EUROPE JAMBOREE</H4><DIV class="newinnerbox"><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:720px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 27: Water retainment by the soil with plants watered in different IAA concentration, control is soil without any <I>Arabidopsis</I>.

The optimal IAA concentration which gives the best water retetntion is between 0.1 nM - 1 nM.</P><P>While <I>Arabidopsis</I> is considered a fast growing plant, it takes several weeks to grow large enough to hold down soil effectively. This effect is exacerbated by the fact that we are growing several plants in one pot, thereby increasing the competition for nutrients.  The plants took a total of five weeks to reach a size suitable for conducting the final erosion test. We set up the experiment to imitate water erosion as shown in the picture below.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:520px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I> Figure 28: Experimental set up of the erosion experiment.

The pots were cut open at one end to allow water with eroded soil to flow into the collecting basin. The slope was constructed by placing the pots on top of a 20 cm x 10 cm slanted platform to create a 30 degree slope. We applied water with a hose to imitate heavy rain fall. The pressure of water was kept constant by an adaptable shower head which imitated the average speed of rainfall (9 m/s) as suggested by Dr. Martin Selby. The shower head was placed about 90 degree to the ground and approximately 30 cm above the plant pot and water was applied for 10 seconds.</P><P>
The eroded soil was collected from the basin and heated to evaporate the water so that we could measure the dry mass. The amount of dry mass collected gives us an indication of the amount of soil that would be swept away by water. Our results therefore show that soil erosion can be prevented through the use of vegetation that has been supplemented with IAA.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:720px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 29: Mass of Soil eroded in different IAA concentration, control is soil supplemented with IAA but without <I>Arabidopsis</I>.

At this concentration, the mass of soil eroded by water was the least and the water retention was the highest. Compared to the control with <I>Arabidopsis</I> and no IAA supplementation, the optimal IAA could improve soil retention by a factor of 100. Moreover, the optimal IAA concentration could decrease the mass of the soil eroded by a factor of 200 when compared to a control where soil in the absence of <I>Arabidopsis</I> was irrigated with IAA supplemented water.</P><P>After the experiment, the plants were collected from each IAA concentration and incubated to obtain the dry mass.

4. Tracking of cell viability using Dendra2</DIV><DIV class="thelanguage"><H3>2.1 Behavioral analysis</H3><P>During the planning stage of our project we discussed several ways that the IAA could be delivered to the plant. In the end, we decided to either have the bacteria chemotax to the root and secrete the IAA around it or to have them be uptaken by the root through a natural process that has been recently documented in 2010<SUP>[7]</SUP>. In order to determine whether the latter option is viable we have to look at the cell viability once it has been taken up into the root. In order to study that, we decided to use a photoconvertible protein called Dendra2.</P><P>Dendra2 is a photoconvertible protein that normally exhibits green fluorescence but can be irreversibly switched following irradiation at 405 nm or 488 nm to red fluorescence. This conversion cannot be reversed<SUP>[4]</SUP>. Dendra2 is therefore very useful for observing the metabolism of cells: if all protein in a cell is converted to red fluorescence and it subsequently expresses green fluorescence, the cell has to be metabolically active.</P><H3>4.1 Photoconversion</H3><P>First we had to determine whether the excitation wavelength of the green fluorescense could photoconvert Dendra2. Since the excitation of the absorbance prior to photoconversion is 486nm and the photoconversion wavelength according to the literature is 488nm we had to make sure that a wavelength of 486nm would not cause photoconversion. In order to test for this, we excited cells with 486 nm and 558 nm wavelengths and measured the fluorescence at the emission wavelengths 505 nm and 575 nm.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:900px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 31: Graph showing the photostability of Dendra2.

Once this was verified we attempted to look at the photoconvertability of Dendra2. We used a wavelength of 405nm and 505nm and then measured the emission at 575nm. Since the FluoroMax-3 machine we intended to use could not emit both of these wavelengths at the same time we had to seek the help of Tim Wilson who pried open the machine and modified it with his own 405 nm laser pen and a filter from our gel imager. These modifications allowed us to obtain the following results.</P><DIV class="imgbox" style="width:600px;margin:0 auto;"><P><I>Figure 32: Graph to show the increase in fluorescence at 575 nm after excitation with 405 nm and 505 nm.

Dendra2 reached its maximum conversion after only 200 seconds making it suitable for in vivo studies. We think that the degradation after the maximum conversion is due to photobleaching. We then decided to move on to something more interesting: testing whether Dendra2 will convert within a bacteria that has been taken up by a root cell!</P><H3>4.2 <I>In vivo</I> photoconversion</H3><P>Following the successful uptake of our Dendra2 expressing bacteria we conducted an in vivo photconversion study on the confocal microscope.

One can also see a single bacteria that was left outside the targeted area that was not converted red.

As expected, greed fluorescence decreased after photoconversion and red fluorescence increased. As the sample was left to incubate at 30˚C, green fluorescence re-emerged as the bacteria are producing more Dendra2. This proves that the cells remain metabolically active and that metabolic activity can be tracked using Dendra2.

By determining the percentage change in green fluorescence after photoconversion and 24 hours incubation in relation to the initial level of green fluorescence (Figure 37), we can clearly see that green fluorescence decreased dramatically after photoconversion (as expected by the properties of Dendra2). Additionally, after 24 hours the initial green fluorescence level was re-established and slightly surpassed due to production of new Dendra2 protein by the metabolically active bacteria. No red fluorescence was re-converted to green fluorescence because Dendra2 irreversibly changes from fluorescing green to red.
