It has been four weeks since we started this endeavour and we are   still nowhere near where we want to be. Time is ticking away, as cliché as that   may sound.</P><P> The day started off with the absence of two of our members   that had fallen ill over the weekend. We missed them dearly but had no time to   stop working! Nic has booked a session on Thursday to use the wide-field   microscope. Operation fancy GFP chemotaxis stuff is a go. On the Arabidopsis   team, Ming did what he does best (in the lab that is).</P><P> Nina and Si   continued to plow through the modelling of chemotaxis. Si has also arranged a   meeting with a PhD student on Thursday to discuss modelling root architecture.   Finally Nikki and Yuanwei put their heads together for the good of the wiki.</P><H3>Tuesday, 2nd August</H3><P>Today was a good day. Chris and Nikki had a succesfull restriction digest of   the backbone vectors. Chris got to do Nick's dirty work while he was in Silwood   with Rebekka talking to ecology expert Alex Milku. When Nick got back he had the   unfortunate finding that the bacteria he was going to use done have flagella,   but its all good in tha hood because James found some GFP bacteria that move! </P><P>The modellers are in their dungeon modelling. Wiki man is making great   progress. </P><P>Ming loves his Arabidopsis so were all happy they are being loved.</P><H3>Wednesday, 3rd August</H3><P>Today we had the pleasure of welcoming Kiran, an A-level student on a work   experience placement. Frank spent the morning showing him around the labs and   showing him the mystical ways of making broth. We gave him some time to get   acquainted with our project before he helped Ming with preparing a whole new   batch of plant media for the experiments and the growing plants. </P><P>We had another visit from the RCA guys, Koby, CJ and Pei, which was cool. We   had a cool discussion about some of our human practices work as well as the more   artistic side of things such as the wiki and videos. </P><P>Nick had a stroke of bad luck this morning, as it seemed that the strain of   bacteria he was using for his transformation appeared to have lost their   antibiotic resistance genes. Oh well. </P><P>The modelling team of Si and Nina were on top form as usual. Si finished a   cool animation and provided Nick with the necessary numbers for his experiments.   Nina spent some time working on the most efficient way to deliver auxin to the   roots, which we should probably have a group discussion about. </P><P>The day ended with Chris sorting out the chemicals for his auxin assays and a   pair of transformations from Frank and Nick. Frank transformed some E.coli with   Berkeley 08's killswitch module and Nick transformed E.coli K12 BL21DE3 with a   plasmid affectionately referred to as pRhys, after its supplier.</P><H3>Thursday, 4th July</H3><P>Today was cool. The PCR of the backbone vectors was succesfull so tomorrow we   are going to gel purify and when the genes arrive we are ready to assemble!   Chris and Nikki started the Salkowski standard curve, living on the edge working   with acid. Nick had super awesome amazing training on the widefield microscope   with the super cool dude and it was so cool. The Mcps bacteria from Spain move,   yay! Frank got some feedback on the kill switch, and got very frustrated working   on it... Rebekka and Ming are preparing the bacteria for uptake by Arabidopsis,   hopefully it works. Nina is starting to model root growth, Si is modeling the   kill switch. You can see what Yuan Wei has been up to here. The new addition to   our team, Kiran, did his first transformation today.... Until next time</P><H3>Friday, 5th July</H3><P>Today, we presented our newest progress report to the professors. </P><P>Frank's security containment device (kill switch) design was improved by   Tom's feedback. Chris Salkowsky reagent'd different auxin concentrations   successfully. Nick did A LOT. He poured plates, practiced how to use capillary   slides. What else did he do? He didn't do much, man. Today he really hasn't done   much. </P><P>Kiran helped Nick do his stuff and set up his own experiments. Yuanwei was   busy re-writing the wiki in HTML and is waiting on Koby's template help, which   should arrive soon. Ming and Rebekka set up slides for confocal imaging and   imaged bacteria inside roots (BOOM)! Si modelled the security containment   device. Nina finished the chemotaxis modelling video and has started developing   a root branching model. Nikki purified the vectors. </P><P>There was cake.</P><DIV class="printfooter">
