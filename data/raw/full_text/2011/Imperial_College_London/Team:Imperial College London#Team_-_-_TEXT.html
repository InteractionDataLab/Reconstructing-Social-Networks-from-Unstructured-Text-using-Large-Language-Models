Team
The Imperial iGEM 2011 team consists of a group of biochemists, biologists and bioengineers. On this page, you can find out about everyone who has contributed to the project. We would like to thank all our advisors who have assisted us throughout the project, and without whom the project would not have been possible. We would also like to thank all everyone else who has helped us realise this project, be it through invaluable advice or providing DNA, seeds, or other materials. These contributions have helped us enormously. All work on this wiki was carried out and all data collected by us unless stated otherwise. For a full list of acknowledgments, please see the bottom of this page.
Students
Atipat Patharagulpong
Atipat is also known as Ming (people sometimes call him ATP, which he finds a bit geeky). He is a third year biochemist and responsible for collaboration, part registry, and Arabidopsis (and also drawing everyone's picture). Apart from Biochemistry, he loves playing the piano, drawing anime, gardening, and also cooking (and eating too).
Chris Schoene
Chris is going into his 3rd year of Biochemistry at Imperial College London and is our official head of parts characterisation. He has been interested in Synthetic Biology since the last year's team presented their project in October. His other interests include creative writing, martial arts, the classical guitar and travelling. He is German but was born in Colombia and has lived in the USA and Spain.
Frank Machin
Frank is halfway through his degree in Biochemistry at Imperial and responsible for the software and hardware. He has been a huge fan of Synthetic Biology ever since he watched "The Andromeda Strain" and "The Day of the Triffids". When he is not working, he likes gaming, loud music, and making short films and he is going to try and include them all in this project!
Jiayue Zhu
Jiayue, or Nina, is a 2nd year bioengineer and does a lot of the modelling work as well as the design of our poster. She is best known for being an unflinching reservoir of calm and playing with her phone in all situations, except, possibly, her death.
Nicolas Kral
Nick has just finished the second year of the BSc Biology degree at Imperial. He has been attracted to Synthetic Biology because of the immense potential and creativity that is hidden in it, while still following the strict scientific thinking. His hobbies include everything to do with Nature and the great outdoors, hiking, climbing, caving and just the joy of being out.
Nikki Kapp
Nikki just finished her undergraduate studies in Biochemistry. She is our team leader and is glad to use the knowledge she has obtained from her course into practice in the iGEM competition. Her duties in the iGEM team include cloning & assembly strategies and outreach/PR. Nikki's life isn't all about science, she is passionate about music and travel and would like to have a taste of different cultures by completing an around-the-world trip.
Rebekka Bauer
Rebekka just finished a degree in Biology. She has taken the role of human practice coordinator and has done mostly plant biology in the lab with some super cool imaging. She likes the creativity of Synthetic Biology as well as its potential application in solving world problems. Outside of science, she is interested in photography, travelling and cooking some tasty food.
Si Chen
Si just graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. She joined the Imperial iGEM team with the intention of delivering a solid solution that can be applied to reality in the future. She is one of our modelling whizzes and can do scarily impressive things on Matlab. She is also the most fashionable person on the team.
Yuanwei Li
Yuanwei just finished the 2nd year of his Biomedical Engineering degree. He is our wiki mastermind. He probably wants to specialise in the mechanical aspect of bioengineering, dealing with things like biomechanics. He is also quite interested in going into the area of biomedical imaging. In his free time, he likes to play his accordion and he loves to travel to different places and explore the world. He is looking forward to delivering something amazing in this iGEM project.

General support
James Chappell, Dr Travis Bayer and others helped us during our brainstorming .
Dr Geoff Balwin is letting us use his lab for some experiments.
Timothy Wilson helped us characterise Dendra2 and gave us some great data.
Chemotaxis support
Prof Xiaodong Zhang at Imperial College London, got us into contact with Dr Juan Luis Ramos in Spain.
Dr Juan Luis Ramos at Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas provided us with the mcpS gene on pRK415 .
Dr Ben Blount & Chris Hirst have helped us with the utilisation of the BD FACScan during data collection.
Jack Turton helped us with manual tracking during data collection for behavioral analysis .
Auxin support
Dr Colin Turnbull and his team ran our LCMS samples , providing critical data for this module
Arabidopsis support
The Arabidopsis thaliana team was kindly supported by Dr Thorsten Hamann and Dr Colin Turnbull's labs at Imperial College. In particular, Issariya Chairam and David Charles helped enormously with designing and setting up plant experiments.
A number of Arabidopsis seeds were supplied by labs from all over Britain:
DR5: GFP seeds were supplied by Samantha Fox from Dr Enrico Coen's group at the John Innes Centre, which focuses on plant development in A. thaliana. Permission to use the seeds and publish results was kindly granted by Dr Jiri Friml at the VIB Department of Plant Systems Biology, UGent.
DR5: GUS seeds were supplied by Dr Gerard Bishop at Imperial College.
DR: 3XVENUS seeds were supplied by Dr Darren Wells at the University of Nottingham. Dr Wells is a research fellow at the Centre for Plant Integrative Biology.
William Rimington is a recent graduate of Warwick University with expertise in Arabidopsis and land degradation . William kindly traveled to Imperial to share his knowledge with the team.
Modelling support
Dr Robert Endres is a Senior Lecturer in Systems Biology at Imperial College. He is an expert on chemotaxis modelling and kindly helped our team with their model of cell movement .
Prof. Malcolm Bennett from Nottingham University provided us valuable support on our modelling of auxin production , and he also directed us to Nathan Mellor, a modelling expert in his research team.
Dr. Jennifer Siggers is a lecturer in fluid mechanics in Imperial College London, she advised us about modelling non-steady state chemoattractant distribution .
Luke Tweedy is a PhD student specialising in chemotaxis modelling; he helped us with the modelling of chemotaxis animation .
Dr Diego Oyarzun is a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Dr. Guy-Bart Stan, at the Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation, Imperial College London. He helped us with developing the modelling strategy for the Gene Guard module .
Imaging support
Dr Martin Spitaler and Mark Scott of the Facility for Imaging by Light Microscopy (FILM) at Imperial College London helped with the setup and execution of imaging and image processing of bacterial uptake into plant roots and chemotaxis .
Human practices support
