On this page, you can find out about everyone who has contributed to the project. We would like to thank all our advisors who have assisted us throughout the project, and without whom the project would not have been possible. We would also like to thank all everyone else who has helped us realise this project, be it through invaluable advice or providing DNA, seeds, or other materials. These contributions have helped us enormously. All work on this wiki was carried out and all data collected by us unless stated otherwise. For a full list of acknowledgments, please see the bottom of this page.</B></P><H1>Students</H1><TABLE cellpadding="10px"><TBODY><TR><TD valign="top" width="280px"><P style="padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;"><B>Atipat Patharagulpong</B></P><P style="padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;">Atipat is also known as Ming (people sometimes call him ATP, which he finds a bit geeky). He is a third year biochemist and responsible for collaboration, part registry, and Arabidopsis (and also drawing everyone's picture). Apart from Biochemistry, he loves playing the piano, drawing anime, gardening, and also cooking (and eating too).</P></TD><TD valign="top"><P style="padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;"><B>Chris Schoene</B></P><P style="padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;">Chris is going into his 3rd year of Biochemistry at Imperial College London and is our official head of parts characterisation.

She is also the most fashionable person on the team.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" width="280px"><P style="padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;"><B>Yuanwei Li</B></P><P style="padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;">Yuanwei just finished the 2nd year of his Biomedical Engineering degree. He is our wiki mastermind. He probably wants to specialise in the mechanical aspect of bioengineering, dealing with things like biomechanics. He is also quite interested in going into the area of biomedical imaging. In his free time, he likes to play his accordion and he loves to travel to different places and explore the world. He is looking forward to delivering something amazing in this iGEM project.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Human/Outreach"><B>High school/ college interns</B></A></H1><TABLE cellpadding="10px"><TBODY><TR align="center"><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Kiran Patel</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Poppy Field</B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1><A href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/syntheticbiology" target="_blank" style="color:#225323;">CSynBI</A> advisors</H1><TABLE cellpadding="10px"><TBODY><TR align="center"><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>James Field</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Dr. Geoff Baldwin</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Dr. Guy-Bart Stan</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>James Chappell</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Kirsten Jensen</B></P></TD></TR><TR align="center" valign="top"><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Lisa Goers</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Prof. Paul Freemont</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Prof. Richard Kitney</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Dr. Tom Ellis</B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1><A href="http://www2.lse.ac.uk/BIOS/home.aspx" target="_blank" style="color:#225323;">LSE</A> advisors</H1><TABLE cellpadding="10px"><TBODY><TR align="center"><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Dr. Claire Marris</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Susanna Finlay</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Alex Hamilton</B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1><A href="http://www.rca.ac.uk/" target="_blank" style="color:#225323;">RCA</A> advisors</H1><TABLE cellpadding="10px"><TBODY><TR align="center"><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Charlotte Jarvis</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Koby Barhad</B></P></TD><TD width="195px"><P style="text-align:center;"><B>Pei-Ying Lin</B></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>Acknowledgement</H1><H2>General support</H2><P>James Chappell, Dr Travis Bayer and others helped us during our <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Brainstorming_Health"><B>brainstorming</B></A>. </P><P>Dr Geoff Balwin is letting us use his lab for some experiments. </P><P>Timothy Wilson helped us characterise <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Auxin_Testing"><B>Dendra2</B></A> and gave us some great data.</P><H2>Chemotaxis support</H2><P>Prof Xiaodong Zhang at Imperial College London, got us into contact with Dr Juan Luis Ramos in Spain. </P><P>Dr Juan Luis Ramos at Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas provided us with the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Design"><B>mcpS gene on pRK415</B></A>.</P><P>Dr Ben Blount &amp; Chris Hirst have helped us with the utilisation of the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Testing"><B>BD FACScan</B></A> during data collection.</P><P>Jack Turton helped us with manual tracking during data collection for <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Chemotaxis_Testing"><B>behavioral analysis</B></A>.</P><H2>Auxin support</H2><P>Dr Colin Turnbull and his team ran our <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Project_Auxin_Testing"><B>LCMS samples</B></A>, providing critical data for this module </P><H2>Arabidopsis support</H2><P>The <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> team was kindly supported by Dr Thorsten Hamann and Dr Colin Turnbull's labs at Imperial College.
