Week 17: 24th October to 30th October
Monday, 24th October
After weeks of waiting, we could finally perform our soil erosion experiment! While Ming and Nikki carried out the experiment, Frank captured it on film.
Tuesday, 25th October
Our imaging data has returned! The bacteria are shown to be metabolically active inside roots, much to everyone's delight. If only the deadline would go away.
Wednesday, 26th October
The wiki editing madness has once more commenced.
Thursday, 27th October
Wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki
Friday, 28th October
With the wiki freeze imminent, the last pieces of data are finally coming together and are being put online at the speed of light. Why, oh why, does that deadline have to be at 5am?
