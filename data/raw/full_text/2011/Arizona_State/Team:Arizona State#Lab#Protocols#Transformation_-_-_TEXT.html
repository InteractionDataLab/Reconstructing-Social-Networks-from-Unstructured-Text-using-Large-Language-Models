NEB ( 10-beta and Turbo )
Thaw a tube of NEB Turbo/NEB 10-beta Competent E.coli cells until the last ice crystals disappear.  Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 uL of cells into a transformation tube on ice.
Add 1-5 uL containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture.  Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.  Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42 C for exactly 30 seconds.  Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.  Do not mix.
Pipette 950 uL of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37 C for 60 minutes.  Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate.
Warm selection plate to 37 C.
Spread 50-100 uL of each well-mixed dilution onto a selection plate and incubate 8-12 hours to overnight at 37 C.  Alternatively, incubate at 30 C for 16 hours or 25 C for 24 hours.
TSS
Thaw 50ul prepared competent TSS cells on ice.
Add approximately 1 ul prepped plasmid to the thawed cells. Make sure the culture is thoroughly mixed.
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice.
Incubate for 30 seconds at 42C (in a water bath).
Incubate for 2 minutes on ice.
Add 1 ml room temperature SOC .
Incubate for 1 hour at 37C with shaking.
Plate with appropriate antibiotic.
Grow overnight at 37C.
