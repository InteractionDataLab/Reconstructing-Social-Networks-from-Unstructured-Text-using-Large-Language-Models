Thursday, September 1
Started to develop Listeria Innocua project component.
Listeria CRISPR only uses cas9 tracr gene
Project requires:
Cas9
Duet plasmid
Listeria T7 RSR
Ligate all together in biobrick
Test with protospacer
Saturday, September 3
3 PCR reactions using LI as template
Samples visualized on gel
sample appears slightly higher than expected
some distortion and low resolution
Sunday, September 4 to Friday, September 9
Cas9 PCR products restricted overnight
Saturday, September 10
9/10 restriction products dephosphorylated for 2 hours
Overnight ligation of dephosphorylated restriction products
Sunday, September 11 to Saturday, September 17
9/8 restriction - 9/10 ligation products transformed into NEB cells
Sunday, September 18 to Saturday, September 24
Attempt to assemble CMR-RSR using overlapping oligos
Began preparation of pSB1C3 plasmid for BioBrick preparation
Sunday, September 25 to Wednesday, September 28
Finalized BioBrick preparation for intended BioBrick part submission
Restrict, ligate, and transform CMR and pRSF. 9/25 Send sample to sequence. 9/27 Sequencing error. They will re-run.
Wiki parties all week in the lab!
Submitted BioBricks!
