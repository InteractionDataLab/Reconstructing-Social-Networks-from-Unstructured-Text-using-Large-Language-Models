Team
ASU’s  inaugural  iGEM  team  consists  of  ten  highly  motivated  undergraduates  from  diverse  backgrounds  in  genetics, biomedical  engineering,  molecular  biology,  computer  science,  and  biochemistry.  Our  project  is  completely  student‐driven  and  an  incredible  educational  opportunity.  In  the  context  of  the  iGEM  competition,  it  provides  us  with  the  means  to  directly  contribute  to  the  field  of  synthetic  biology  in  a  significant  way  and  present  our  findings  on  an  international  stage.
