50 uL Ligation (from OpenWetWare ):
Add 22.5 uL deionized H20 to sterile eppendorf tube
Add 5 uL of ligation buffer to the tube
Vortexing buffer before pipetting helps ensure that it is well mixed
Add 15 uL of insert to the tube
Add 5 uL of vector to the tube
Add 2.5 uL of ligase
Pipetting up and down before adding to tube helps ensure that it is well-mixed
(vortexing the ligase may be inappropriate due to the sensitivity of the enzyme)
Let 50 uL solution sit at 22.5 C (room temperature) for at least 30 mins
Heat inactivate ligase at 65 C for 10 mins
Store at -20 C or proceed to transformation
