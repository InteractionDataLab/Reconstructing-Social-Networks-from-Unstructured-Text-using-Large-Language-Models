Submitted synthesis requests for RA, DA, and Seq1 from BioBasic
Thursday, June 2
Meeting with Dr. Chang and her grad students from the School of Life Sciences to explain iGEM project.
Single sided synthesis with phosphotase direction?
Made amp plates:
100 mg / ml amp
Made liquid culture using LB Broth:
5 g peptone
2.5 g yeast extract
5 g NaCl
500 ml water
Incubated and shook liquid culture overnight
Friday, June 3
Confirmed placement of synthesis order
Placed second large order for necessary laboratory materials
Met with Barrett funding advisor
Met with Jon, grad student from Misra's lab
Lab:
Resuspended part E0840 from well following parts registry protocol
Followed "competent cells and chemical transformation procedure for DH5 alpha":
Made 20mM concentration MgCl2 in shaken cells from yesterday
Shook for 2 hours in 37 C room
Saturday, June 4
Made 500 mL SOC following OpenWetWare protocol
Transformed resuspended DNA into E. Coli
Followed transformation protocol, but did not use water bath
Monday, June 6
Transformed cells from Saturday, June 4th did not grow yet
Test if competency procedure killed cells using following procedure:
Make LB=
Repeat transformation using water bath instead of heat block:
Thaw competent cells on ice
50 ul cells + 1 ul resuspended DNA, on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock cells at 42 in a water bath for 60 seconds
Incubate on ice, 5 min
Add 100 ul SOC to cells
Shake at 37 C for 2 hours (11 am - 1 pm)
Plate 20 ul, 200 ul (2 plates)
Incubate overnight
Tuesday, June 7
Amp plates did not grow
Competent cells plated without amp grew
New transformation using 2 different parts conducted did not work with either part:
BBa_E0840
BBa_E0240
Control onto non amp plate to test if transformation killed cells showed that the cells were still viable
Wednesday, June 8
Autoclaved lab materials to be sterilized
Made 200 ml new SOB, 50 ml SOC
New transformation protocols:
Top10 chemically competent E. Coli from biodesign
Part: BBa_E0840
Using top10 protocol
Plates: # 4 50ul, 5 150ul
MG1655 plated from plate # 2:
Plate: # 1
From: 6-2 plate MG1655
Overnight culture:
From plate # 3
Thursday, June 9
Xiao introduced 3 grad students who can offer advice/assistance throughout the project
We will meet with them (likely Thursdays @ 10am) to update them on our progress
Yesterday's plates:
#4, 5 have colonies but no glow with UV - no promoter in biobrick part
Need to add in a promoter
Today:
Add in promoter for GFP construct
Constitutive promoter:
Part: BBa_J23101
Use Knight restriction protocol
Cut promoter BBa_J23101 with ECORI, SPEI
Cut GFP generator BBa_e0840 with ECORI, XHOI
DNA extraction- use "ethanol precipitation of nucleic acid" procedure
Ligate restriction products
Transform ligation products
Create stock of competent cells
Order Top10 cells (what strain are these?)
Make glycerol stock of BioBrick
Jon/Misra procedure for competent cells and transformation:
Overnight culture from previous:
Diluted 1 to 50
Shook 1 hr in 37 C room
Friday, June 10
Lab today:
2 competency procedures (Jon, CCMB80)
3 transformation procedures (Jon, CCMB80, top10 from biodesign)
12 plates made (see lab notebook)
Autoclaved glass test tubes
Dan demonstrated to lab members how to make glycerol stocks
Bought top10 competent cells
Got account set up (still need to create Sunrise account)
Got Xiao refunded
Met with James Alling, who is a JD-PhD interested in helping us out
He is very good at speaking and could help with presentation later
Very attracted to promoting big picture of project
Kylie determined new primers after noticing that we don't need Cas 1,2,3 for our natural cas construct (from "structural basis for CRISPR")
This brings Cas construct size down to a total of 3.8kb instead of over 5kb
We will try both ways, and see if cas 1 and 2 do anything interesting
We are considering getting primers for each individual Cas gene (Cas A, Cas B, etc...)
Biobasic is taking twice as long as they advertised (no DNA until june 20?)
From now on we will go through IDT due to slow turnaround from BioBasic
We contacted BioBasic about discount, got a synthesis price reduction
Saturday, June 11

Plates from yesterday worked completely as expected
Plate 6:
Plate 15:
Overnight culture in amp grew
Today:
Glycerol stock made of DA
Overnight cultures made of DB, sEQ1 from plates
Ran gel of PCR from last night
DNA extraction 2x (elution)- verified using nanodrop, did not get enough to be successful
Another overnight PCR using different settings
Designed new primers for casA-E + cas3
Friday, June 24
Ran gel from PCR carried out last night
Still doesn't work!
DNA extraction using spin method from Miniprep protocol(DB, SEQ1)
Still doesn't work!
We went through hassle of ordering new Cas primers from IDT
Ordered a pair of primers for each Cas gene - this way we can customize and perhaps PCR out in sections
Saturday, June 25
Transformations of DA, DB, and Seq1 into the BioBrick ampR vector (pSB1A3) into TSS and NEB cells was successful
Made overnight liquid culture to miniprep tomorrow
Sunday, June 26
Made LB amp plates
Conducted restriction digest...
We used the wrong enzymes! used EX and EP instead of EX and ES
Ran gel on previous PCR
Didn't linearize plasmid before running results on a gel
Monday, June 27
We identified the Top 10 lab techniques to learn and love
Dan emphasized that we need to be independent and know these!
Redid restriction digest
Two methods for restriction: Ginkgo bioworks (two bricks into desired plasmid) and traditional (EX and ES)
DA: ES, EX
Seq1: ES, XP
PSB1A3: EX, EP
Some Gel errors
1) did not let gel dry completely before removing comb
2) too much voltage caused gel deformation
Ran out of PSB1A3
Lesson learned: don't use it directly! must grow it up first
Ordered more from iGEM HQ
Cultured B. Halodurans
We rehydrated cells and let culture grow overnight in tryptic soy broth
Made overnight cultures of Seq1, DA, DB, and E0840
Overall message: Not a great day in terms of results, but many tough lessons learned.
Tuesday, June 28
B. halodurans developments
Cells retrieved from overnight culture
Made 4 plates on tryptic soy media, as well as 7 more tryptic soy plates
Made one glycerol stock
Conducted Genomic prep + PCR using primers R1 and R2
Nanodrop new record! 220ng/ul template DNA
"Ode to Trinette" Haiku by Joseph Flay
PCR is hard
Trinette, you are so thermal
Thanks for the fun times
Conducted miniprep of Seq1, DA, DB, E0840
Nanodrop results (see Kylie's notebook)
Further restriction digests
Made "restriction supermix" of water, BSA, NEB4 (1x, enough for 30 digests)
Seq 1: ES, EX
DA: ES, EX
DB: ES, EX
E0840: EP
Made and ran a large gel
Problem: used wrong hyperladder (used I instead of II)
Successfully isolated: Seq 1 (ES), Seq 1 (EX), DB (EX), E0840 (insert), E0840 (vector)
Unsuccessful: DA (ES), DA (EX), DB (ES)
Transformed RA, RB into NEB cells (no control)
Replated BL21DE3 x 1 and MG1655 x 1 on LB Agar
Moved plates from 4 degree room to small fridge in lab because they are fixing the room tomorrow (and got rid of some old plates)
Took lab inventory (mostly)
Made more overnight cultures:
B. halodurans x 1
Other notes: Paul Johnson sent us a nice message basically saying that as long as we can justify it, iGEM is here to stay
(meaning they will keep funding the team in the coming years)).
We also talked about getting FURI and SOLUR funding for next year's team.
An REU proposal was discussed, but ultimately abandoned because a majority of the team's students would need to be from outside ASU, which we don't want.
Overall: people kept very busy, we worked well in teams, however we need to make sure we are really paying attention to what we do - mistakes cost time and money!
Tomorrow: plan on ligation, check PCR results, run a gel for PCR results, order primers for B. halodurans, try restriction of DA again, miniprep and try restriction of RA/RB
Wednesday, June 29
Plates from last night (see pictures):
LB + AMP + RA
LB + AMP + RA
LB + AMP + RB
LB + AMP + RB
Restriction digest of DA, DB (2x)
Run a gel: CMR product from BH PCR
Conducted gel extraction, submitted extracted DNA for sequencing
Very low yield (~20 ng/uL)
Thursday, June 30
New primers arrived from IDT for second round of attempts at getting the cas genes out of MG1655
After successful isolation of what looks like the CMR genes from Bacillus halodurans, a second attempt was run overnight
Got our sequence data from last night for CMR genes: looks like we successfully amplified CMR!
Gel results:
Cultures of RA/RB grew well
Conducted miniprep of RA x2, RB x2
More restrictions:
DA ES EX (2x)
DB ES XP (2x)
RA ES EX XP (2x)
RB ES EX XP (2x)
