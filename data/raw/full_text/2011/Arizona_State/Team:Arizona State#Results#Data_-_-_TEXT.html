Construction of RSR+Leader Array
Gel results: Correct size for the RSR+Leader Array in the 6th well. Confirmed with DNASU sequencing.
Sequencing verification showed a 99% base pair match for "Seq1" and the MG1655 leader sequence, confirming the successful assembly of the array
Isolation of Cas genes
CasABCDE was unsuccessful, though we came close:
Cas3 was moderately successful, but unconfirmed via sequencing:
Assembly of Leader+RSR into pRSF Duet
Assembled on 9/28/2011.
Poly-X Ligation
We devised a new assembly method, the Poly-X Ligation, for RSR construction and tested it on an RSR construct with GFP.

B. halodurans
Construction of RSR Array
We constructed a 1x Repeat-Spacer-Repeat array by ligating our "RA" (Spacer-Repeat) sequence to our "RB" (Repeat) sequence
Isolation of cmr genes
Our construct requires the isolation of 6 genes, Cmr1-6, that are all located on a single locus.
Gel results (CMR success):
Assembly into pRSF Duet
L. innocua
Construction of RSR Array
This construction of the RSR array involved the ligation of two customized BioBricks ( sequences ), which can be done simultaneously using this protocol .
Cas gene
The L. innocua CRISPR system utilizes three CRISPR-associated genes: Cas1, Cas2, and Cas9.
For our streamlined construct, we needed to isolate only Cas9, which is approximately 4kb in length.
We PCR amplified Cas9 with the adjacent trans-encoded CRIPSR RNA region (tracrRNA), which is necessary for the formation of mature CRISPR RNA.
Assembly into pRSF Duet
Cas9+tracrRNA array has been ligated into pRSF Duet

Construction of constitutive GFP plasmid by ligation of Bba_E0840 with Bba_(promoter)
Success was marked by green colonies
