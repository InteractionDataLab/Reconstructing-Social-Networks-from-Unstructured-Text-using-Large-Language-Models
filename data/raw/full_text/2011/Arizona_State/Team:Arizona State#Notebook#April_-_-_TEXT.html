Thursday, April 14
Today we had our first meeting with a grad student- just bouncing some ideas off of him for feasibility. There is no RNAi in prokaryotes! Some ideas included a small molecule inhibitor / morpholino oligomers.
The first CRISPR information was found and was noted as something to follow up on in further meetings.

We discussed CRISPR more exensively- we are beginning to latch onto the idea as a fully formed project. Building on earlier discussions, the goal would be to target an antibiotic resistance gene (NDM-1) to ameliorate that resistance completely.

Ethan presented an outline of CRISPR and the possible project to the group for consideration. Some questions that came up:
What is the advantage of using this entire process? Is not it kind of roundabout?
The structure of CRISPR lends itself to a modular platform- the degree to which the pathway is active can be shown to be dependent on the number of spacers which are easily controlled.
How will we motivate bacteria to take up potentially deleterious genetic material? What about an F-factor plasmid?
Trojan Horse D- maintains growth advantage
What has been done, what is the advantage of this approach?
Practical point of view: two steps that can be done in parallel
CRISPR design for different sequences
Downregulate NDM1 protein with plasmid
Can we use phages to introduce a CRISPR array?
High throughput methods & random mutations, screen for them
Could we use CRISPR to downregulate a repressor of something?
