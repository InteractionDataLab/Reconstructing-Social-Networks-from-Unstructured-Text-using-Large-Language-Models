For 50 ul reactions, prepare master mix as follows for n tubes:
10*n uL 5x Phusion buffer
4*n uL 2.5 mM dNTPs
2.5*n uL forward primer
2.5*n uL reverse primer
29.5*n uL PCR water
Add 48 uL master mix to each of seven tubes.
Label tubes blank, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10
Add DNA and MgCl2 to tubes according to chart:
