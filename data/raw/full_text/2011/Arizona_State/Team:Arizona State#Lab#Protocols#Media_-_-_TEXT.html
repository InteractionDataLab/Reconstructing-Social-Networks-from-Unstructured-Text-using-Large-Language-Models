SOB / SOC
"Super optimal broth" (SOB) and "super optimal broth with catabolite repression" (SOC) are nutrient-rich media. Use extreme caution (and if possible make only small amounts) when manipulating, as they are very easy to contaminate.
For 1 L SOB, combine:
20 g Tryptone
5 g Yeast extract
0.5 g NaCl (8.56 mM)
1.86 g KCl (2.5 mM)
ddH2O to 1 L
Autoclave.
SOC: Add to SOB:
0.952 g MgCl2 (10 mM) or 2.408 g MgSO4 (20 mM)
3.603 g glucose (20 mM)
Do not autoclave SOC, as the glucose will react with the tryptone. Either autoclave glucose separately or filter sterilize the SOC.
LB agar
Combine 3.7 g LB agar with 100 ml H2O. Autoclave or microwave. Makes ~4 plates.
LB broth
For 1 L, add to 800ml water:
10 g tryptone
5 g yeast extreact
10 g NaCl
Adjust ph to 7.5
Adjust volume to 1 L
Autoclave
Trypticase soy broth
Trypticase soy agar
For 1 L:
30 g soy broth
15 g agar
H2O to 1 L.
Autoclave
