Liquid Culture:
Pick single colony from plate with pipet tip.
Drop tip in tube of ~7 mL LB media (with selected antibiotic if necessary).
Shake overnight at 37C.
Plating Cells:
From solution/liquid culture:
Apply 100-200 μl cell solution to LB agar plate containing appropriate antibiotic.
Place spreader in 95% ethanol, remove and sterilize in flame.
Using sterilized spreader, gently spread solution around plate.
Store upside down at 37C overnight to grow cells.
Store at 4C long-term.
Streak plating:
Place inoculation loop in 95% ethanol, remove and sterilize in flame.
Cool inoculation loop by pressing into a section of agar in used plate.
Pick single colony of cells from original plate.
Streak colony across new plate.
Store upside down at 37C overnight to grow cells.
Store at 4C long-term.
Glycerol Stock:
Prepare solution of 40% glycerol by volume.
Add 750 μl cell solution and 750 μl glycerol solution (or 1:1 mix) to Eppendorf tube.
Store at -80C.
