Our design
To achieve this goal, we use a species of magnetic bacteria, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. We have chosen mms13, a transmembrane protein as our target for protein design in this bacterium, as it serves as a linker between reception of wireless magnetic field and optogenetic neuro-stimulation output. Regarding the neuroimmune response, we choose three genes to achieve symbiosis within glial cell: MinC, a division inhibitor, INV, a gene for invasion and LLO, a gene for facilitated escape from phagosomes.
Our design is made up of the following two devices:
Optomagnetic Design
Bridge magnetics and optogenetics
NeuroSymbiosis
Make magnetic bacteria symbiosis with glia cell
