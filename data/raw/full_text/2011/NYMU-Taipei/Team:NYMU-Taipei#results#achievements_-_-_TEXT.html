Achievements
We designed a new cloning vector for AMB-1 which is compatible with common BioBricks, making it easier for iGEMers to clone into the magnetic bacteria AMB-1.
We submitted over 60 parts to the registry, which can be used for applications of magnetic enlightment, cloning AMB-1, and Symbiosis with Human cells.
We designed helical anti-membrane protein CHAMP for mms13, separating the two helices of the magnetite binding protein mms13 and making it a flexible part for the use of magnetic field in iGEM.
We removed a PstI site from the part BBa_K299806, a part which expresses the MinC protein. We improved the compacity of this part.
We designed a free online software, which provides an automated ONE-STEP primer design service of BioBricks for iGEM.
