Collaborations On The Settlement Of Magnetic Chassis
Tsinghua University
Tsinghua University
After China meet-up, we contacted team leaders across mainland China. The Tsinghua 2011 iGem team showed great enthusiasm in measurements on the growth curves of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, and testing the GFP-expressing shuttle-vector between "Magnetospirillum magneticum" AMB-1 and Escherichia coli, pYMBG (rbs: Pmsp3) anf pYMBG (rbs: Pmsp3 trunc.).As reported from their wiki , pYMBG has successfully been characterized as a competent shuttle vector.
Tianjin University
Tianjin University
Tianjin University has been collaborating with us on assisting our characterizing of pYMBG shuttle vector, and measurements of growth curve with Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. We have also shown mutual friendship and willingness for long-lasting relationship.
UST-Beijing
UST-Beijing
UST-Beijin showed great interests in our Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 and asked us for sending them these bacteria. We have sent them AMB-1 and have been collaborating on characterization of pYMBG (rbs: Pmsp3) and pYMBG (rbs: Pmsp3 trunc.) on Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 and the establishment of growth curves.
