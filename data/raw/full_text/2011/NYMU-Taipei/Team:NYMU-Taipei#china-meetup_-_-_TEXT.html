We attended the "2011 China meet up" held at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from July 29th to July 31th.

About 20 iGEM Teams from China and Taiwan participated this meet up. Most of the teams made a short presentation of their projects in the meet up and had discussions with each other.  We made many friends and made collaborations with Tsinghua , Tianjin , and UST-Beijing in our project.
