This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.

Overall project
Optogenetics, the latest neuroscientific method, has improved specificity for stimulating certain cell types of neurons, reversible bi-directional stimulation, and elevated spatiotemporal precision. However, to achieve neuronal network stimulation, light cables are still needed, leaving long-standing annoying issues regarding immune responses unresolved. This year NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates wireless neuro-stimulator, focusing on achieving remote neuro-stimulation to minimize the invasion and damage to the neuron. To achieve this goal, we use a species of magnetic bacteria, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. We have chosen mms13, a transmembrane protein as our target for protein design, as it serves as a linker between reception of wireless magnetic field and optogenetic neuro-stimulation output. Regarding the neuroimmune response, we choose three genes to achieve symbiosis within glial cell: MinC, a division inhibitor, INV, a gene for invasion and LLO, a gene for facilitated escape from phagosomes. Overall, our project will make optogenetic neuro-stimulation wireless and safe.
