(5) Expression of TetR Protein Enabled Regulation
Fig. From the left to right, there are separately marker labelled at 72kDa and 26kDa,
supernatant control, supernatant experiment, pellet control, pellet experiment.
Tetracyclin resistent protein and GFP were induced by IPTG to express in BL-21 E.coli strain for the confirmation of the construct.As SDS-PAGE shown above, there is no difference between supernatant control and experiment while tetracyclin resistent protein and GFP express in the pellet experiment.It is proved that the expression of tetracyclin resistent protein can enable the regulation.
Symbiosis within Human Glial Cells
(1)Magnetotactic bacteria were introduced into guanulocytes and monocytes by phagocytosis.(Tadashi Matsunaga et all. 1986)

Measurements of Construct tetR+rbs+gfp under Fluorescence Microscope
These are the measurements of our construct tetR+rbs+GFP (BBa_K624001) under fluorescence microscope. The picture on the left is from the control group of E. coli strain DH5-alpha. The middle is tetR+rbs+gfp in plasmid pSB1C3 in E. coli, while the right is from a plate without any bacilli. All graphs are measured in fixed exposure time. Construct of tetR+rbs+gfp which emits light is thought to be a leak phenomenon of plasmid, while RE digest has proved that the sequence length is correct, and further sequencing work is under operation.
gfp measurements under different excitation wavelengths
The expression of gfp is measured precisely under excitation wavelength from 475nm to 501nm, given the absorption wavelength 511nm.  In our measurement, wavelength over 493nm yields high background, resulting in values of control group surging far beyond normal condition.  Thus, 493nm is suggested as the best excitation wavelength, as it presents the highest emission light and the lowest of the control group.
