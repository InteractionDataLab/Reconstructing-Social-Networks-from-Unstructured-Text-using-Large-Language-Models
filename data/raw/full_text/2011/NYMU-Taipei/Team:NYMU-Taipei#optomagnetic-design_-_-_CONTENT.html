How to use the conformation change of the Mms13 transmembrane protein to induce the light?  <FONT color="MidnightBlue">We first came up with the idea by using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)</FONT>. BRET is based on resonance energy transfer between a light-emitting enzyme and a fluorescent acceptor (Johan Bacart, et al., 2008). For example, the energy derived from a luciferase reaction can be used to excite a fluorescent protein when the latter is in close proximity to the luciferase enzyme. Several other methods developed are shown in Table 1.
</FONT></P><FONT size="3"><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:562px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Table 1: Several BRET methods have been developed.(Cite from: <U><A href="http://www.berthold.com/ww/en/pub/bioanalytik/applikation/bret.cfm" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.berthold.com/ww/en/pub/bioanalytik/applikation/bret.cfm</A>)</U></DIV></DIV></DIV></FONT><P><FONT size="3">
We chose the original BRET method using coelenterazine (luciferin) as substrate in BRET 1 method (See Figure 1). What we do is anchoring the YFP on the N-terminus of Mms13 and r-Luciferase on the C-terminus. <FONT color="mediumblueblue">We expect that when the magnetic force applied on the membrane and changed the conformation of Mms13 would lead to the close proximity between YFP and r-Luciferase and thus induce fluorescent phenomenon by BRET method)(See Figure 1).</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">
The advantage of BRET is that it is a non-radioactive and homogeneous technology. There is no auto-fluorescence coming from compounds or cell and buffer components as no light source is required. And the most of all, it make the conformation change of Mms13 possible to induce optomagnetic enlightment in bacteria. So, are we satisfied with our BRET design? The answer is no; the BRET method is good but not good enough in our project.

Mms13 possesses two tightly-interacting transmembrane helices present as the major obstacle within our optomagnetic design, since theoretically, BRET will be an constitutive phenomena, leading to uninhibited excitation / unregulated inhibition of target neurons. However, the anticipated model we proposed rooted heavily in induced BRET with conformational wobbling within mms13, functioning as switches for neurons shifting back and forth between <B>&quot;ON&quot;</B> and <B>&quot;OFF&quot;</B> states.

We found inspiration from a paper associated with the bimolecular ï¬uorescence complementation (BiFC) method. The BiFC assay is based on the association between two nonï¬uorescent fragments of a ï¬uorescent protein. When those fragments are brought in proximity to each other by an interaction between proteins, they would fuse into one functional ï¬uorescent protein (Tom K. Kerppola., 2008). <FONT color="mediumblue">We came up with the idea by mixing the BiFC method and BRET phenomenon into the BiFC-based BRET design. (See Figure 2)</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT size="3">
In our BiFC-based BRET design, we anchored a half of a YFP fragment (with YFP C-terminus) on the inter-helical inhibitor (the CHAMP peptide design). By using the inhibitor, we can affect the tight interaction between Mms13âs two helices, and the constant light induced form BRET phenomenon can also be blocked. The rest of the design is to get the other half of the YFP (with YFP N-terminus) anchored on the N-terminus of Mms13 and anchored the r-Luciferase on C-terminus of Mms13. The result is that when there is no magnetic force applied to Mms13, two helices of Mms13 will have further inter-helical distance due to the inhibitor (CHAMP design) and the BRET phenomenon will not perform due to the lack of close proximity between two helices. When we apply magnetic force to Mms13, the helices of the transmembrane protein will be pulled together and will induced the BRET phenomenon to emit fluorescence.

Though we have already done the design part of our project, we may be challenged by whether it can function in reality or not. We consulted with Professor Chun-Min Lo who has a professional background in biomechanics. One of his research interests is to apply magnetic force on the super magnetic particles contact on the cell membrane and measure the cellâs morphology and biomechanics to study the growth of cells. <FONT color="mediumblue">After we told him about our project and our final goal to achieve, he showed interest and was willing to help us in calculating and modeling our optomagnetic design and he also generously supplied electromagnets, a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by the flow of electric current, in his lab.</FONT> We then modeled and calculated the force and magnetic field applied to the magnetic bacteria by using Professor Chun-Min Loâs devices.

A schematic of the experimental setup, with the electromagnet device shown in cross section. (Joseph N.

</P><P>The magnetosome crystal is known to have high chemical purity so its magnetization can reach to the saturation limit for 3*10<SUP>5</SUP> A/m. The average diameter of the magnetosome is 46 nm in magnetic bacteria, so the volume per bead will be 4.077*10<SUP>-22</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP>. By calculating the data in the paper, we discovered that the cell can have very large scale of deformation when only around 2 nN is applied. With just 2 nN force, we can that track that cell and we can then trace back to the gradient of the magnetic field we should apply to the bacteria.
</P><P>The average number of magnetosomes in magnetic bacteria is 20 particles. We should apply 2 nN/20=0.1 nN to one magnetosome. Dividing this by the total magnetosome volume (4.077*10<SUP>-22</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP>), there would be 0.1 nN / (4.077*10<SUP>-22</SUP> m<SUP>3</SUP>)â2.453*10<SUP>11</SUP> N/m<SUP>3</SUP> for force per volume. The gradient we need can be measured by dividing the force applied per volume to the saturated magnetization, which is:  (2.453*10<SUP>11</SUP> N/m<SUP>3</SUP>)/(3*10<SUP>5</SUP> A/m)â8.176*10<SUP>5</SUP> T/m. 
</P><P>However, we certainly do not need the high gradient of up to 8.176*10<SUP>5</SUP> T/m. Because the need to pull the membrane and change the conformation of proteins would not require that much force. If the devices we apply now would not strong enough to change Mms13âs conformation, there is still nothing to worry about because we can add more turns per unit length of electromagnet to increase the magnetic gradient and thus induce stronger force to fulfill our goal.
