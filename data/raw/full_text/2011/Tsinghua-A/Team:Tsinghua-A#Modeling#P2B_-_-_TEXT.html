Modeling ::Simplified Model
preparation | parameters | results
Although ODEs provide a thorough, precise description of the whole system, they contain too many equations and parameters which would act as a barrier for simulation and further analysis. A simplification of complicated ODEs is necessary. We simplify every single ODE according to certain appropriate assumptions. Finally, we came up with a set of DDE equations.
