Modeling Overview
In our project, we are dedicated to design a quorum-sensing oscillator which consists of two types of cells. Cells of the same type can fluctuate synchronously and certain designs were made to adjust the phase and the amplitude of oscillation. These are the things that our modeling part aims to simulate. We built and simplified our simulation system step by step and deepened into further characteristics of the system, which would provide firm evidence proving that our design does work.
PART 1 Accurate Model
In our first step, we wanted to describe the system thoroughly without leaving out any seemingly unimportant actions and factors. As a result, the description of the system contains every possible mass actions as well as some hill kinetics, Henri-Michaelis-Menten. We came up a set of ODEs with 19 equations.
