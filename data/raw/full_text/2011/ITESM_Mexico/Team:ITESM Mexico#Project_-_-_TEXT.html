Project
The project is derived from the very simple idea of controling a cell function at our will.
For that we needed two things:
First we need to provide the cell with an ability we require
Second we need to create a way to order the cell to use that ability
We devised the use of sensors to give the cells a way of knowing when our command input has been addressed and a complex function to perform upon such input.
