Acknowledgments
We would like to do a special mention for all the people who helped us along this difficult journey:
We want to thank all the teams whose work was fundamental for ours: Tokyo-NokoGen (2009) , Chiba University (2010) , UNAM-Genomics México (2010) , British Columbia (2009) , Cambridge (2010) and ITESM campus Monterrey (2010)
Ph. D Sonia Vázquez Flores and Ph.D Prashant Kumar Mishra for being our tutors, many times sacrificing leisure time, weekends, and even vacations. Spending hours with us at the night shifts in the lab and sending countless emails. For being our sponsors, teachers, and friends.
Ing. Juan Carlos Ituarte Zarza and SEDESU: For giving us the trust and capital to accomplish this project. Without his support this project would have never been possible. Juan Carlos is the director of SEDESU (Spanish acronym for Sustainable Development Secretary).
