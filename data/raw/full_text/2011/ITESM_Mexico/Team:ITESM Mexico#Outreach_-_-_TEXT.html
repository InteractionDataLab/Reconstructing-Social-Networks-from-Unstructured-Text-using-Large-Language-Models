Outreach
Looking to find a solution to the embargo that the customs office was setting upon our materials, Dr. Sonia sent a letter to the presidential office seeking aid. From the office we received two response letters:
In such letters we are told that the Secretary of Treasury will investigate the case and act accordingly. After a few days Dr. Sonia received a call from the Secretary in which she was told that they had scheduled a meeting with special representatives to seek for a solution. Nontheless such meeting was programed in México City on a date that was very inconvenient to us. Following a long series of telephone calls negotiatons led to nowhere and got stucked.
