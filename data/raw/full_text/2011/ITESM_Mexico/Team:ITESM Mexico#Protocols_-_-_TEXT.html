Resuspended DNA. DNA kit plate
To use the DNA in the Distribution Kit you may follow these instructions:
With a pipette tip, punch a hole through the foil cover into the corresponding well of the Biobrick™-standard part that you want. Make sure you have properly oriented the plate. We recommend that you do not remove the foil cover, as it could lead to cross contamination between the wells. But it is important to take care of  the plate orientation after punching the foil.
Pipette 10uL of dH2O (distilled water) into the well. Pipette up and down a few times and let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended. We recommend that you do not use TE to resuspend the dried DNA.
Transform 2µL of the resuspended DNA into your desired competent cells, plate your transformation with the appropriate antibiotic and grow overnight.

Resuspended DNA
Competent cells
Start thawing the competent cells on crushed ice.
Add 100 µL of thawed competent cells and then 2 µL of the resuspended DNA to the labelled tubes. Make sure to keep the competent cells on ice.
Incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ºC for 2min. A water bath improves heat transfer to the cells.
Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes.
Add 200 μl of LB broth (make sure that the broth does not contain antibiotics and is not contaminated)
Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 2 hours while the tubes are rotating or shaking. Important: 2 hour recovery time helps in transformation efficiency, especially for plasmids with antibiotic resistance other than ampicillin.
Label two petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 20 µl and 200 µl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
Incubate the plate at 37ºC for 16 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow. This is especially true for ampicillin - because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivate the antibiotic outside of the bacteria.
Pick a single colony and inoculate broth (with the correct antibiotic) and grow for 16 hours.
Use the resulting culture to miniprep.

Biological agents
Bacterial culture grown
Fill a centrifuge tube with saturated bacterial culture grown in LB broth + antibiotic. Spin tube in centrifuge for 1 minute, and make sure tubes are balanced in centrifuge. Dump supernatant and drain tube briefly on paper towel.
Repeat step 1 in the same tube, filling the tube again with more bacterial culture. The purpose of this step is to increase the starting volume of cells so that more plasmid DNA can be isolated per prep. Spin tube in microcentrifuge for 1 minute. Pour off supernatant and drain tube on paper towel. If necessary, repeat this step (depending on the amount of pellet)
Add 2 ml ice-cold Solution 1 (GTE) to cell pellet and resuspend cells as much as possible using disposable transfer pipet.
a.Solution 1 contains glucose, Tris, and EDTA. Glucose is added to increase the osmotic pressure outside the cells. Tris is a buffering agent used to maintain a constant pH (8.0). EDTA protects the DNA from degradative enzymes (called DNAses); EDTA binds divalent cations that are necessary for DNAse activity.
Add 4 ml Solution 2 (NAOH + SDS 1%), cap tubes and invert five times gently. Let tubes sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Solution 2 contains NaOH and SDS (a detergent). The alkaline mixtures ruptures the cells, and the detergent breaks apart the lipid membrane and solubilizes cellular proteins. NaOH also denatures the DNA into single strands.
Add 3 ml ice-cold Solution 3 (Potassium acetate), cap tubes and invert five times gently. Incubate tubes on ice for 10 minutes.
a.Solution 3 contains a mixture of acetic acid and potassium acetate. The acetic acid neutralizes the pH, allowing the DNA strands to renature. The potassium acetate also precipitates the SDS from solution, along with the cellular debris. The E. coli chromosomal DNA, a partially renatured tangle at this step, is also trapped in the precipitate. The plasmid DNA remains in solution.
Centrifuge tubes for 5 minutes. Transfer supernatant to fresh centrifuge tube using clean disposable transfer pipet. Try to avoid taking any white precipitate during the transfer. It is okay to leave a little supernatant behind to avoid accidentally taking the precipitate.
This fractionation step separates the plasmid DNA from the cellular debris and chromosomal DNA in the pellet.
Fill remainder of centrifuge tube with isopropanol. Let tube sit at room temperature for 2 minutes.
Isopropanol effectively precipitates nucleic acids, but is much less effective with proteins. A quick precipitation can therefore purify DNA from protein contaminants.
Centrifuge tubes for 10 minutes (13.4krpm max). A milky pellet should be at the bottom of the tube. Pour off supernatant without dumping out the pellet. Drain tube on paper towel.
This fractionation step further purifies the plasmid DNA from contaminants. This is also a good place to stop if class time is running out. Cap tubes and store in freezer until next class period.
Add 10 ml of ice-cold absolute ethanol. Cap tube and mix by inverting several times. Spin tubes for 1 minute. Pour off supernatant (be careful not to dump out pellet) and drain tube on paper towel.
Ethanol helps to remove the remaining salts and SDS from the preparation.
Allow tube to dry for ~5 minutes. Add 500 ul TE to tube. If needed, centrifuge tube briefly to pool TE at bottom of tube. DNA is ready for use and can be stored indefinitely in the freezer.
Preparing Plates, Solutions, and Bacterial Starter Plate
Follow the kit directions to prepare and pour the agar plates, and to rehydrate the provided lyophilized materials such as E. coli bacteria, antibiotics, DNA, etc.
Prepare and pour the agar plates—LB only (LB) and LB plus ampicillin (LB:AMP).
a. Label the plates with permanent marker: LB and LB:AMP.
b. After the agar solidifies, cover the plates, put them in their original plastic bags, and store them in a lab refrigerator stacked upside down. Store plates wrapped up in their original plastic wrappings. Storing upside down will ensure condensation does not wet the surface of the agar.
c. Note that the pGlo Transformation kit also allows for visualization of the transformation. In addition to the acquisition of Ampicillin resistance, the transformed bacteria can also express another gene on the pGLO plasmid which causes the bacteria to glow a brilliant green color. In order to see this, prepare the LB:AMP:ARA agar plates as specified in the pGLO transformation kit product insert. After transformation on day 2, plate the transformed cells on the LB:AMP:ARA plates as well. The arabinose in the agar will induce expression of the green fluorescent protein and the bacteria will glow green. While this step is cool to see it is not required for you to determine transformation efficiency. The Bio-Rad pGLO transformation kit comes with one UV penlight. This should be sufficient to visualize the glowing bacteria. However if you have access to a laboratory with a long wave UV lamp, that will be great. Caution - Do not shine UV light directly into the eyes, use a UV-protective face shield or goggles, and limit exposure to UV light.
Rehydrate bacteria and streak LB starter plates.
Incubate starter plates overnight at 37°C (or 2 to 3 days at room temperature until colonies are clearly visible). 5 mL Overnight
What you will need:
10 mL culture tube Use 16mm x 160mm or 16mm x 125 mm
5 mL LB

Single colonies on a plate Best not to start O/N from glycerol stocks
Procedure
Pipet 5uL 1000X antibiotic into culture tube.
Add 5 mL non-contaminated LB. Do this first, then add antibiotic
Select single colony using sterile toothpick or a flamed loop that has been cooled

Biological agents
• Bacterial culture grown
Fill a centrifuge tube with saturated bacterial culture grown in LB broth + antibiotic. Spin tube in centrifuge for 1 minute, and make sure tubes are balanced in centrifuge. Dump supernatant and drain tube briefly on paper towel.
Repeat step 1 in the same tube, filling the tube again with more bacterial culture. The purpose of this step is to increase the starting volume of cells so that more plasmid DNA can be isolated per prep. Spin tube in microcentrifuge for 1 minute. Pour off supernatant and drain tube on paper towel. If necessary, repeat this step (depending on the amount of pellet)
Add 2 ml ice-cold Solution 1 (GTE) to cell pellet and resuspend cells as much as possible using disposable transfer pipet.
a. Solution 1 contains glucose, Tris, and EDTA. Glucose is added to increase the osmotic pressure outside the cells. Tris is a buffering agent used to maintain a constant pH (8.0). EDTA protects the DNA from degradative enzymes (called DNAses); EDTA binds divalent cations that are necessary for DNAse activity.
Add 4 ml Solution 2 (NAOH + SDS 1%), cap tubes and invert five times gently. Let tubes sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
a. Solution 2 contains NaOH and SDS (a detergent). The alkaline mixtures ruptures the cells, and the detergent breaks apart the lipid membrane and solubilizes cellular proteins. NaOH also denatures the DNA into single strands.
Add 3 ml ice-cold Solution 3 (Potassium acetate), cap tubes and invert five times gently. Incubate tubes on ice for 10 minutes.
a. Solution 3 contains a mixture of acetic acid and potassium acetate. The acetic acid neutralizes the pH, allowing the DNA strands to renature. The potassium acetate also precipitates the SDS from solution, along with the cellular debris. The E. coli chromosomal DNA, a partially renatured tangle at this step, is also trapped in the precipitate. The plasmid DNA remains in solution.
Centrifuge tubes for 5 minutes. Transfer supernatant to fresh centrifuge tube using clean disposable transfer pipet. Try to avoid taking any white precipitate during the transfer. It is okay to leave a little supernatant behind to avoid accidentally taking the precipitate.
This fractionation step separates the plasmid DNA from the cellular debris and chromosomal DNA in the pellet.
Fill remainder of centrifuge tube with isopropanol. Let tube sit at room temperature for 2 minutes
Isopropanol effectively precipitates nucleic acids, but is much less effective with proteins. A quick precipitation can therefore purify DNA from protein contaminants.
Centrifuge tubes for 10 minutes (13.4krpm max). A milky pellet should be at the bottom of the tube. Pour off supernatant without dumping out the pellet. Drain tube on paper towel.
This fractionation step further purifies the plasmid DNA from contaminants. This is also a good place to stop if class time is running out. Cap tubes and store in freezer until next class period.
Add 10 ml of ice-cold absolute ethanol. Cap tube and mix by inverting several times. Spin tubes for 1 minute. Pour off supernatant (be careful not to dump out pellet) and drain tube on paper towel.
Ethanol helps to remove the remaining salts and SDS from the preparation.
Allow tube to dry for ~5 minutes. Add 500 ul TE to tube. If needed, centrifuge tube briefly to pool TE at bottom of tube. DNA is ready for use and can be stored indefinitely in the freezer.
