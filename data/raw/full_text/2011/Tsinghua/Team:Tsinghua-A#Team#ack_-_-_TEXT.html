All work on Operation ECHO, including Wet Lab Experiments, Modeling and Wiki Designing, was done by the team members during the past few months.
Additionally, we get our basic Wet-Lab training from the team's advisor, Dr Chen(陈阳) and lab teacher Ms Yang.
Also some java-script used in my web-designing is acquired from the jQuery library .
Operation ECHO could not have been accomplished without the effort of every AutoGemers!
To Those we gave our deep appreciation
Ms. Yang and Dr. Chen for instructing us in strain construction.
Dr. Wang  for instructing on our model building.
Dr. Chen  for advices on prototype design.
