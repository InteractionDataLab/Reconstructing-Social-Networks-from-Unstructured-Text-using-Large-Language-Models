From 2011.igem.org
test whether the agent gradient in the gel stick can produce the gradient in the surrounded solution.
Prepare: gel stick mold: transfer pipet and tube parafilm: to block up the tube agarose beakers dishes NaOH At this time, we use ddH2O and agarose to make gel
0.4g agarose, 1.6g NaOH(1mM) and 40ml water.
Besides, we add NaOH into the gel to make the gradient.
But unfortunately, the gel is unable to coagulate.
OH- can influence the formation of glucosidic bond between two single agarose molucule.
We modify experiment protocol. OrengeG(OG) is used to test the diffusion effect visually.
1. we make a gel containing 1% OG, without gradient. After the gel become solid, we incubate the stick in water. Then about 2min later, we can see that dye diffuse into water.
2. We make a gel with OG gradient with the “calculus method”. 0, 0.1%, 1% 10%. we can see the OG gradient in water.
