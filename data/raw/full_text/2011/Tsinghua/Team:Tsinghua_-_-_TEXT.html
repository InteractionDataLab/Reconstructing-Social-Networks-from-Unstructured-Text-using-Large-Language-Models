Team
The team from Tsinghua University is comprised of undergraduates from the School of Life Sciences.
This year we want to exploit the value of E. Coli that is often overlooked, piggy-backing the metabolites as they come across.

Project
This project is aimed to generate several E. Coli strains which will cooperate with each other to move forth and back and transport any desired protein along a gradient. Module composition: binding, releasing, transition, movement...

Parts
We built a host of parts during our project. The idea is that after every small step, we store our sequence as a biobrick part.
This strategy marks our progress and facilitates future use of these sequences.

Experiment
Our experiments are carefully recorded on a daily basis. Through the series of records, we can see our joys and sorrows.
Besides, we made the records for the purpose that our experiments can be repeated one day by someone else, thus contributing to the exploration of the unknown.

Cooperation
Cooperative atmosphere is filled in our project.
We resorted to Tsinghua-A iGEM Team while building our mathematical models. On the other hand, we spared no effort helping other teams with their wet labs. We helped XMU Team with their parts building and helped verified the shuttle vector of NYMU.

Protection & Publicity
As far as wet lab is concerned, safety and protection is of the highest priority. We highly valued safety in all our operations and made a detailed safety brochure.
We also devoted efforts to publicize synthetic biology. The teams in China held a summer meetup to discuss our progress and share our resources. We also invited the former team leader of PKU to give a seminar on synthetic biology and iGEM competition.
