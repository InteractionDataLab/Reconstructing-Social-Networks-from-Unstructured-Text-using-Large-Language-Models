Descriptions
We assembled  BBa_E0840  under the pLas promoter  BBa_R0079  that was contained into K574009. We kept pSB1A2 as the scaffold vector.
Methods
1. Ligate  BBa_E0840  downstream of  BBa_K574009  , which acts as a reporter.
2. Culture the positive colony at 37°C, 220 rpm for 12 hours, as well as the DH5alpha.
3. Dilute 1:25 the former in 15 falcon tubes (4 ml cultures), each 3 tubes as a group. The later is also diluted in 3 tubes as the negative control.
4. After culturing for another 2 hours, as their OD600 reach 0.2, induce with 3OC12HSL 0, 1e-7 M, 1e-6 M, 1e-5 M and 1e-4 M respectively.
5. Take samples after 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours, that is, centrifugalizate 0.5 mL of each culture and suspend them by 1 mL of PBS (phosphate-buffered saline).
6. Measure the fluorescence of the samples with the flow cytometer.
Results
From the chart, we can see that cells were hardly induced in the control group, and with the concentration of inducer growing, the intensity of GFP increased by groups. The most efficient concentration of inducer was around 10-5M, and higher concentration may lead to the expression of GFP decreasing. Additionally, to most groups, the intensity of GFP reached its maximum after 4 hours.
