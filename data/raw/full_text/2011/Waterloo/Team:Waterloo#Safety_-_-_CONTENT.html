The use of this project is primarily reserved for research and laboratory use, therefore, should not purposefully be exposed to the public or environment except after further testing in its specific applications (such as with particular fusion proteins). Furthermore, the basis of our project is to establish a self-excising sequence (ribozymes), which should limit the expression of any intervening sequences to the RNA level. If the intervening sequence were something of environmental or public relevance (such as antibiotic resistance), the experimental design indicates that the sequence will be removed and, thus, not expressed. This is a relevant contribution of the design in limiting expression to the RNA level, which eases environmental hazard concern upon the accidental release of a GMO containing this biobrick. Therefore, the new biobrick parts submitted should not raise any safety issues.
</P><P><B>The necessary facility, equipment and handling procedures associated with Level 2 Biosafety concerns were met:</B></P><UL><LI>Pipetting aids
</LI><LI>Biosafety cabinets where applicable
</LI><LI>Laboratory separated from other activities
</LI><LI>Biohazard sign
</LI><LI>Proper safety and disposal equipment, including autoclave
</LI><LI>Personal protective equipment, worn only in the laboratory
</LI><LI>Screw-capped tubes and bottles
</LI><LI>Plastic disposable pasteur pipettes, when necessary
</LI></UL><P><B>The necessary precautions regarding recombinant DNA and microorganisms were observed:</B></P><UL><LI>All waste was autoclaved before disposal
</LI><LI>Researchers practiced aseptic technique and personal hygiene and safety precautions
</LI><LI>Bench surfaces were disinfected with ethanol
</LI><LI>Procedures likely to generate aerosols are performed in a biosafety cabinet
</LI><LI>Potentially contaminated waste is separated from general waste
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Safety_Questions"> Safety Questions </SPAN></H2><P><B>1. Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:</B>
The materials used in the lab are non toxic to health of individuals as well as to the environment. One of the major reagents that is used is GelRed which is used as a substitute for Ethidium Bromide. Gel Red is unable to penetrate into cells and so is a non-mutagenic agent. As well it has the same spectral characteristics as Ethidium Bromide and so has the same effectiveness of use. The project itself is safe even if released into the environment by design or accident since the part being expressed is the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Unless the sequences are mutated, the project poses no risk.
</P><P><B>Please explain your responses (whether yes or no) to these questions.</B></P><P><B>Specifically, are any parts or devices in your project associated with (or known to cause):</B></P><P>- <B>pathogenicity, infectivity, or toxicity?</B> No
</P><P>- <B>threats to environmental quality?</B> No
</P><P>-<B> security concerns?</B> No
</P><P>The parts that are associated with the project this year are at the same level of risk as the any of the regular parts that already exist. All parts are constructed in an antibiotic containing backbone so that accidental release of will pose minimal risk to contaminating other bacterial populations.
</P><P><B>2.Under what biosafety provisions will / do you operate?</B></P><P><B>a.Does your institution have its own biosafety rules and if so what are they?</B>
The University of Waterloo had a Bio-Safety plan in place to ensure the proper use to bio-hazardous materials in teaching and research at the university. A more detailed overview of their plans is outlined at the <A href="http://www.safetyoffice.uwaterloo.ca/hse/bio_safety/bsc.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Bio-Safety Website</A></P><P><B>b. Does your institution have an Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent group? If yes, have you discussed your project with them?</B>
The laboratories operating at the University of Waterloo have obtained permits from the Bio-Safety Committee in order to perform intended research. Since the Waterloo iGEM team performs all laboratory work in a parent lab under the guidance of the Masters and PhD students of that lab, the projects carried out in the lab are covered by the permits obtained by the parent lab.
</P><P><B>c. Will / did you receive any biosafety and/or lab training before beginning your project? If so, describe this training.</B>
All lab volunteers are required to take an online training to familiarize themselves with the Biosafety practices of the University of Waterloo. The training is followed up by a quiz ensuring proper understanding of the material. Upon completion of the training and quiz a hands- on lab training is provided under supervision of the parent lab’s PhD student. The hands-on training involves instruction of use of the appropriate equipment that is used in the lab, as well as how to maintain and discard materials in a safe manner. 
</P><P><B>d. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, provide a link to them online if possible.</B>
Canada operates under the guidelines set up by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Agency is the national authority on matters concerning biosafety and biosecurity. Risks to the public are reduced by standardizing controls over activities that involve human pathogenic agents, domestic or imported. While these guidelines are in place the current iGEM project does not involve work with any agents or materials that may pose a risk to humans.
