Team:Waterloo/Notebook
From 2011.igem.org
This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, a lab notebook, and a safety page.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.

You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook.  This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer.  It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
