and showed there was no DNA left at all. This means we have to do
the restriction digest again.
Since one of the biobricks (CI repressor BBa R0051) miniprepped be-

this transformation again.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">wednesday 20th of July</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">A new restriction digest was performed <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:KULeuven/Figures#fig04"><I>(FIG.4)</I></A>. Restriction purification

BBa K091100 and lambda cI and luxR regulated-hybrid BBa R0065.
We transformed these bricks into competent cells and grew these cells
on agar plates. A new restriction digest was performed, this time ac-

After DNA gel electrophoresis, only U (= constitutive promoter, Bba_j23119) and W (= pBAD, Bba_I13453) showed high enough concentration to cut them out of the gel. Since these were the only fragments, we didn’t start ligation.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">tuesday 2nd of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">A new minipreparation of all the promoters and GFP was done, this time according to the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:KULeuven/Protocols#plasmid"><I>CTAB method</I></A>. However, this didn’t result in high enough concentrations to go on with restriction and we decided to make new cultures for a minipreparation tomorrow.
E. Coli MG 1655 cells were made competent and can be used for GFP-testing later.
</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">wednesday 3th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Another minipreparation was done and again we didn’t get any results.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">thursday 4th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Contamination on the agar plates was discovered and we decided to start all over again with the experiments, since we didn’t get any good results lately.
A transformation of promoters W (=pBAD), U(= constitutive promoter), R(=pLac-Lux), S(=plambda CI and LuxR regulated), B (= pLac/Mnt) and insert G (= GFP) was done in DH5alpha cells and TOP10 cells.
</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">friday 5th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The transformation of DH5alpha cells seemed to have worked and precultures were made for miniprepping.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">saturday 6th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The new miniprep didn’t result in DNA.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">monday 8th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Minipreparations of the promoters and GFP were carried out by Lies Vandesteene of the Molecular Physiology of Plants and  Micro-organisms Section. She applied the CTAB method and  managed to get good  results. She also did a restriction and ligation of the promoters with GFP in TOP10 cells.We did a transformation of biobricks H (Crt-EBI),  I (RBS-CI repressor),  X (ribokey) and K (terminator) in TOP10 cells.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Tuesday 9th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Instructor Erwin Swinnen carried out a DNA purification of the same biobricks as Lies did the day before. A high DNA yield was obtained. We have enough DNA of the promoters and GFP in stock to go on with restriction and ligation.10 colonies per ligated fragment were inoculated  in LB medium with ampicillin so another minipreparation  can  be done tomorrow. 3 other biobricks were also inoculated  in LB medium (O= hybB  promoter, BBa_K410000; T= LuxR, Bba_C0062 and Y= MelA, Bba_K193602) but instead of ampicillin they were inoculated with a different antibiotic.
</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Wednesday 10th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Minipreparations of the ligated fragments were done, followed by restriction digest to check if there are any fragments that are ligated correctly.

The bands on the gel were inconclusive. We decided to do the restriction again but opted to put the samples on gel on Tuesday. We also PCRed MelA  and 4 vectors (psB1A3, pSB1K3, psB1C3 and psB1T3). We also ligated all the promoters excluding hybB with GFP.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Tuesday 16th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The restriction started the day before was completed by putting the samples on gel. (We decided to make 2 different gels; a  2% and a 4% gel because of low amount of base pairs of the restricted fragments.)  The PCR we did on Monday showed, after loading 3µL onto a gel, no results. We therefore decided to do 2 PCRs: one of psB1A3 and  another of psB1A3 containing pBAD.  After putting them on gel we saw a band in the lane which contained the plasmid which was PCRed from the plasmid with pBAD.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Wednesday 17th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">We started the day off with a CTAB minipreparation of the ligated constitutive promoter with GFP and INP and afterwards we did a restriction and purified the samples out of the gel. We also did a restriction of the plasmid which was PCRed the day before.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Thursday 18th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The purification protocol usually used has a very low success rate thus today a restriction was purified from gel with <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:KULeuven/Protocols#optimizing">a different protocol</A> to see if this one has a higher success rate. The vectors pSB1C3, pSB1K3 and pSB1A3 were miniprepped and restricted. Restrictions were also done on LuxR, pBAD, Ribolock CeaB and ribokey ( no purifications were done). pBAd was ligated to GFP and a transformation of LuxI was also done.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Friday 19th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">GOOD NEWS: a ligation was successful!!!

Restriction of the terminator was because of this repeated.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Monday 29th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The GFP testing was continued. The PCR of LuxI, done last week with the general primers, keep failing thus we suspect that the functionality of the primers is the cause of the continual failure. To test this we PCRed LuxI and HybB with the general primers and when we put the PCR on gel, we saw no bands and have concluded that the general primers are faulty.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">Tuesday 30th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">We did  minipreparations of Ribolock CeaB – Terminator and INP – Terminator.

Meeting with instructor for sensitivity analysis.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">tuesday 30th of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Meeting with instructor Lyn, discussing finished description of the cell death model.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">wednesday 31st of August</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Working on description of freeze subsystem. Doing some sensitivity analysis.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">thursday 1st of September</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Searching more accurate kinetic parameters and references.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">tuesday 6th of September</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Small presentation to give the other teammembers an update in modeling. Good remark of instructor on our model, we made a mistake in the working of LuxR-AHL induction/inhibition. Brainstorm on how to put modeling on the wiki. Brainstorm on how to make an introduction movie for iGEM jamboree.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">wednesday 8th of September</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Made corrections to description of modeling. Wiki division for modeling is finished by designers. We will put a first version of the model on the wiki soon, although this should still be updated with the LuxR/AHL complex. Thank you, designteam, for making the modeling page, ready for us!</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">thursday 9th of September</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Worked on the full model today, included the LuxR/HSL complex. The iGEM-team of 2008 KULeuven also used it in their system, so it was just copy/pasting. The antifreeze and cell death descriptions are corrected for a second time. Two slides for jamboree in Amsterdam are prepared. </SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">friday 10th of September</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Worked on full model. Searched for promoter kinetics, maybe we should use hill kinetics? Some other team with experience in this subject? Learned how to scan sensitivities for individual parameters. Conclusion: we should rebuild the promoters in the wetlab to optimalize our transcription parameters and increase the production of proteins. </SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-dayno">thursday 15th of September</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Modeling page is updated with the pages for the 3 subsystems: freeze, antifreeze, cell death.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
