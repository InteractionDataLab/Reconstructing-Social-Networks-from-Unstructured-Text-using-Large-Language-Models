K.U.Leuven Team
The 2011 team consists of (bio-) engineers and (biomedical) scientists of the KUL, and – new this year – media developers from the MAD faculty of Genk. Each team member spends his/her summer holiday working on the project. The project was housed at the laboratory of Functional Biology of the Faculty of Science, which kindly provided space for experiments, access to computers and appropriate equipment.
Attributions
If you scroll over the team member pictures, you will see what they mainly did for the project. Most team members actually attributed to different parts in the project than the 'prescribed' role, but you'll only see the 'main role'.
Collaborations
• We sent a plasmid containing the InaZ-gene to the Edinburgh iGEM team.
• We took the initiative to organize a debate and invited the ULB iGEM team to present their project.
