Biobricks
The list of all the biobricks that we used are on the iGEM registry which can be found here .
Below you can see two short videos in which we added different kinds of E.D Frosti to supercooled (-6°C) ultrapure “milli-Q” water (Millipore Corporation). The first video (GFP-control), is a control: when E.D. Frosti constitutively expressing a GFP construct is added to the supercooled water, it does not freeze.  In the second video (INP), E.D. Frosti contains a constitutively active Ice-Nucleating Protein producing biobrick ( BBa_K584027 ). When we added this to the supercooled water, it froze immediately.
