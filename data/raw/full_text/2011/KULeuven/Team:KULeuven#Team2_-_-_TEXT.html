K.U. Leuven Team
The 2011 team consists of (bio-) engineers and (biomedical) scientists of the KUL, and – new this year – media developers from the MAD faculty of Genk. Each team member spends his/her summer holiday working on the project. The project was housed at the Faculty of Science, which provided a space for experiments, access to computers and appropriate equipment.
