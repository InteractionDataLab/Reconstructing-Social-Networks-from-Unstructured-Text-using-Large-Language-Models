E.D. FROSTI Project overview
After stimulation, E.D.Frosti will acquire its desired biological property, i.e. the expression of Ice Nucleation Protein (INP) to induce ice formation, or the expression of a membrane-attached Antifreeze Protein (AFP) to  prevent ice formation. Upon application in the environment at low temperatures, a cell death mechanism will kill off the cells, though the desired biological activity of the proteins on the membranes will remain. This mechanism  ensures that the bacteria cannot overgrow the environment.
Importantly, without any  preceding stimulus, no cell death will be induced at low temperatures, so our  organism can be safely stored in the fridge.
