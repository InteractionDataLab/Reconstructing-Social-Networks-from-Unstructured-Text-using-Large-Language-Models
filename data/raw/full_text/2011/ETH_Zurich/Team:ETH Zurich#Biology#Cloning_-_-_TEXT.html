Preparation
Clean glass plates with 30% EtOH (front- and back-glass plate, 10-spike comb)
Assemble them in SDS-PAGE gel casting apparatus
Mix the ingredients for the running gel except for APS and TEMED
Add APS and TEMED to the lower gels solution, mix by gently
Pour the gels quickly with a 2 mL pipette. Leave about 1 cm below the bottom of the comb for the stacking gel and avoid formation of air-bubbles.
Overlay your gels very carefully with isopropanol. The isopropanol helps to avoid drying-out of gels during polymerization and puts weight on the gel thereby helping to obtain a smooth surface.
Wait until all gels have polymerized completely
Mix the components of the stacking gel while the running gel is polymerizing, leave out the APS and TEMED
Remove the isopropanol completely, wash with 0.5 mL of H2O to get rid of all isopropanol
Add APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, mix by gently shaking the Falcon tube
Pour the stacking gel on top of the running gel
Insert the comb without introducing air-bubbles.
Wait until gels have completely polymerized (approx. 30 min)
Remove the gels from the casting apparatus, remove the combs, and clean the gels from gel-remnants
SDS-PAGE
Assemble SDS-PAGE apparatus
Load 5 µl protein marker into the first well
Mix 50 μl samples with 50 µl Laemmli buffer
Incubate the mix at 95°C for 10 min in a heating block
Load 10 µl of your samples into the following wells (non-induced, induced…)
Connect your gel chamber to the power supply, run the gel with 120 V fixed for around 40 min, watch the advance of the blue front
When the blue front is ca. 0.5 cm before the end of the gel, stop the run and remove the gels from the apparatus
Remove the gel from the glass-plates
Add ca. 100 ml Coomassie staining solution to the gel and incubate on the shaker for ca. 30 min
Rinse the gel with ddH2O
Add ca. 100 ml destaining solution to the gel, incubate for until the protein-bands are clearly visible and background signals are almost completely disappeared
Western Blot
The western blot was performed using the QIAGEN Penta-His HRP Conjugate Kit. A detailed description of the different steps can be found in [1] .
Some important notes on the protocol:
Prior to performance of the western blot, a SDS-PAGE gel was done as described in the chapter above.
We used the tank-blotting procedure as described in the protocol provided by the company.
For immunodetection (chromogenic method) we used a HRP Conjugate Substrate Kit from Bio-Rad [2] .
Diffusion test in tubes
agarose with E. coli with IPTG inducible GFP were filled in different tubes
one end of the tube was put in a IPTG solution
