We could not have achieved our SmoColi all by ourselves, and after our long journey we have many people to thank! First of all, this project would not have been possible without the support of our supervisors Sven Panke and Joerg Stelling and the support of our sponsors . We would also like to extend lots of thanks to the following people, companies and organizations without whom our project would not have been possible:
Biology
Marius Müller at D-BSSE , ETH Zurich, for helpful suggestions for experimental design, especially acetaldehyde handling
Sonja Billerbeck , Andreas Bosshart , Andreas Meyer and the whole BPL research group of Professor Sven Panke at D-BSSE , ETH Zurich for their inputs and suggestions about biological research techniques and error solving.
Process Design
Dr. Olivier Frey of the Bio Engineering Laboratory at D-BSSE , ETH Zurich, for enlightening discussions about microfluidics
Microsoft Research for the Microsoft Research Image Composite Editor which enabled us to reassemble nicer pictures of gradients that do not fit into a single microscope frame / photo.
Modeling
Sotiris Dimopoulos of the Computational Systems Biology Group , ETH Zurich, for helping with sensitivity analysis and providing analysis tools.
Philipp Rüst of the Center of Mechanics , ETH Zurich, for giving the modelers a short crash course in COMSOL Multiphysics.
The Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) of ETH Zurich for providing us access to COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB.
The Mathworks for MATLAB .
The COMSOL Group for COMSOL Multiphysics .
The Institute for Systems Biology for Dizzy .
Wiki
Thanks to the jQuery Project for their amazing jQuery and jQuery UI libraries, and to Google for publically hosting both of them .
Jonathan Neal for the jQuery SWFObject extension for jQuery, which enabled us to include Adobe Flash content within the wiki.
Contributions
Contributions done to our project by non-team members:
Dr. Olivier Frey of the Bio Engineering Laboratory at D-BSSE , ETH Zurich, provided microfluidic tubes and different microfluidic channel
Marius Müller at D-BSSE , ETH Zurich, provided the AlcR protein
Prof. Sven Panke at D-BSSE , ETH Zurich, provided the pCK04AxylR plasmid
Khlebnikov et al. for providing us the strain BW27783
