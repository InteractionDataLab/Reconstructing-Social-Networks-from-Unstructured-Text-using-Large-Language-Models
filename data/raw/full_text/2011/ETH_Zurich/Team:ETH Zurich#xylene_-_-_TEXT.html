How we calculated the concentration of m-xylene in the medium...
1. We assumed that 5 ml xylene is enough to saturate the gas phase in the Erlenmeyer flask.
The vapor pressure was calculated at 37 °C:
with the following C1-C5 values:
2. The Henry´s constant at 37 °C can be calculated by the Van´t Hoff equation from the literature value at 25°C
3. By Henry´s law we calculated the concentration of xylene in the medium
4. For the oil/xylene mixtures we assumed that paraffin oil has a vapor pressure of 0 and used Raoult's law
