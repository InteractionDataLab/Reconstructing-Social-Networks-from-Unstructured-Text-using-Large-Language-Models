SmoColi - Circuit Design
To realize the smoke sensor (see Project Idea ), we implemented three distinct network designs: one SmoColi sensing acethaldehyde (see Figure 1), one sensing xylene (see Figure 2) and one sensing arabinose (see Figure 3). All designs share the same signal pre-processing, processing units, and a similar design in the signal detection unit.
