SmoColi-Data page
SmoColi cells are engineered to sense toxic substances found in cigarette smoke. They are immobilized in a microfluidic channel, in which a concentration gradient of the toxic substance is established. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that leads to input-concentration-dependent GFP expression. Continuous increase of the input concentration and its detection, therefore, establishes a moving fluorescent band in the channel. Finally, if the input concentration exceeds a certain threshold, cells produce RFP and the device turns red.
How Our System Works
Our Favorite New Parts
MainPage -LacIM1, BBa_K625000; E. coli codon-modified LacI designed to avoid recombination with the wild type LacI in a system where both variants are present, LacIM1 binds to Plac and inhibits transcription. ( Characterization )
MainPage -Psb6A5, BBa_K625005; improved Plasmid pSB6A1 (ETHZ, 2007): transcriptional terminators added. ( Characterization )
MainPage -PU promoter BBa_K625003; improved version of BBa_I723138 (Glasgow, 2007) Promoter regulated by the transcriptional activator XylR (shortened version) ( Characterization and Dose response fit )
Characterized New Parts
MainPage - PTet - LacIM1 - Termination, BBa_K625001 ( Characterization )
MainPage -PU promoter, BBa_K625002; improved version of BBa_I723138 (Glasgow, 2007); Promoter regulated by the transcriptional activator XylR (long version with stop codon) ( Characterization )
Characterized Pre-existing Parts
Experience -PBAD promoter, BBa_I13453 (Endy Lab, 2005) dose response for homogenous expression of the PBAD in BW27783 ( Characterization )
