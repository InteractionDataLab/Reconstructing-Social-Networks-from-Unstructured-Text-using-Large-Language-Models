Dry lab results
Using our software tools we have evolved a pool of candidate expression adaptors from which we have picked six sequences (BBa_K528015 to BBa_K528020)with variable expression levels and synthesized them. This way we have obtained expression adaptors on pSB1C3. All adaptors are under BBa_J23102 promoter in order to measure their strength acording to Synthetic Biology standards.
The adaptors have following predicted strengths according to RBSDesigner software:

So far we have managed to obtain only BBa_K528021 (BBa_K528018+YFP measurement device) as working part. We have characterized it using fluorimetry in order to see how accurate are RBSCalculator predictions for the BBa_K528018 adaptor. We have obtained following results:

As you can see prediction is quite accurate. Clonning of other fluorescent proteins and testing the rest of expression adaptors is still to be done.
