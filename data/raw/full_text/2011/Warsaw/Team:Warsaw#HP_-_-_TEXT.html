Team up with BioCEN to teach about synthetic biology
Centre for Innovative Bioscience Education
BioCEN is the Centre for Innovative Bioscience Education in Warsaw. The aim of the BioCEN is to reduce the gap between science and society and popularize biology by conducting educational activities and providing educational materials. All activities are focused on improving biology education in Poland and awareness of the latest biology achievements. BioCEN runs laboratory workshops for students, practical courses for biology teachers and open lectures.  You can learn more about BioCEN here.
Since there is not much information on synthetic biology in Polish we prepared an introductory material that explains the idea of synthetic biology to high school students. We also wrote about the parts registry, iGEM competition and described our favourite iGEM project ideas. You can see it here.
