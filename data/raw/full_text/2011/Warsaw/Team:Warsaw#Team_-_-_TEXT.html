Michał Lower
I come from Warsaw, our capital city :-). I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Virology was about new method of rapid determination of type III DNA methyltransferase recognition sequences. Apart from molecular biology I'm passionated with computer programming.
prof. dr hab. Jacek Bielecki
Education: MSc, University of Warsaw, 1975 ;PhD, University of Warsaw, 1981 ;Associated professor, Warsaw University, 1995; Professor at University of Warsaw, 1996 ;Vice Dean of Faculty of Biology, 1996 - 1999, and 1999-2002
Research interests: Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).
Paweł Urbański
I am a student of physics and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include engineering biological systems, molecular biology and biophysics. Besides the science I’m interested in travelling, running and Ice skating.
Ela Jankowska
I am an undergraduate Biotechnology student at the Warsaw University. Lately my scientific interests include ancient DNA of the Pleistocene fauna, but I think that almost everything in biology is interesting, which is why I'm here:) Apart from that I love mountains, travelling and singing in a choir.
Dorota Sabat
I come from Warsaw :) I am studying biology and psychology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. I'm interested in genetics, sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. My hobbies include rock climbing and scuba diving :)
Krzysiek
I study Biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Beside this I'm also interested in chemistry and physics. Outside the lab I am a scout leader, sometimes do some computer programming and I love everything connected with science-fiction and fantasy.
Anna Olchowik
I am a first year phd student at International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw and I am currently working on bioinformatics of restriction enzymes. I love traveling and ice skating. I enjoy programming.
Jarosław Pankowski
I live near Warsaw and I study Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Genetic of Bacteria is about plasmid and chromosome encoded ability of marine bacteria to form biofilm. Besides the science I'm interested in fantasy books, metal music and for some time long sword fencing.
Kamil Koper
I come from a small town in south-east Poland, but I spent most of my life living in Warsaw. I study Biotechnology at the Warsaw University in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology. My B. Sc. thesis focused on human mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and their correlation with the occurrence of specific forms of cancer. If I'm not in the lab or out playing billiards with friends you can usually find me in my workshop, or playing vintage video games.
Radosław Stachowiak
My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!
Ania Puławska
I'm Anna I study biotechnology at Warsaw University, precisely in Department of Virology. I am sure that this is exactly where I should be:) Probably I'm the happiest student in Warsaw:D
Apart from my duties, I have many hobbies. I love traveling, drawing (check the home page graphic), snowboarding in winter or sailing in spring:) What more can I say? I'm an optimist^^
Dominik Cysewski
I come from Wroclaw, most charming city of Poland;-) I'm a graduate student at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). Now I'm working on cross-linking of protein complexes and mapping them. Science is fascinating of course... But my hobby is mountaineering.
Cherry Moreno studies medical biotechnology in the Department of Immunology at Warsaw Uniwersity, where she works with LPS, natural regulatory T cells and their Tool-like receptors. She sings in a Russian Orthodox Choir, her father comes from Panama and she hates itchy clothes labels. She loves dancing, watching nature and flow cytometry!!!
