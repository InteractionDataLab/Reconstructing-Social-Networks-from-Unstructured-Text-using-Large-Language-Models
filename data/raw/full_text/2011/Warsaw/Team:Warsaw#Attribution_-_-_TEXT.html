We prefer cooperation over competition. We adopted a shift based work system in the wet lab it helped us to save time, and allowed many people to work on the same parts of the project. Some team members used to come early in the morning and after dinner their experiments were passed to others, who like working late. Our dry lab worked mainly at home.
Attributions by project:
Synthetic Cloning
RFC that would help other teams perform Synthetic Cloning was prepared by Anna Olchowik and Michał Lower.
RBS Measurement
70 constructs needed for this experiment were cloned by: Dorota Kaja Sabat, Krzysztof Szczepaniak, Elżbieta Jankowska and Paweł Urbański
Parts' characterization using FACS measurements were conducted by Paweł Urbański under the supervision of Cherry Moreno with some help from other team members.
Parts' characterization using fluorimetry was performed by Paweł Urbański. The rest of the team has put significant effort in preparation of bacterial liquid cultures for the measurement. We'd like also thank Radosław Stachowiak, who allowed us access fluorimeter in his lab and advised us about experimental setup.
Expression Adaptors
Constructs were designed by Michał Lower and Anna Olchowik and cloned by Elżbieta, Kaja and Krzysztof
Human Practices
Krzysztof and Paweł have prepared educational materials about synthetic biology and its uses for BioCen, center of BioEducation. The materials will be used by BioCen teachers to show primary and high school students what is Synthetic Biology. Moreover Paweł has prepared more detailed script about physics and modelling in Synthetic Biology directed to undergraduate students. All information is available on BioCen web page (in Polish).
Software
Was designed Michał Lower and implemented by Paweł Urbański under Michał's supervision. The original idea of expression level profiling by applying genetic algorithms and evolution in silico came from Anna Olchowik during one of our brainstorming talks.
Wiki
Team's webpage draft has been coded by Anna Olchowik and Michał Lower, the final webpage has been recoded by a specialist in the field - Marta Błaszkiewicz.
It wouldn't look nice without Ania Puławska hand-made pictures. All members of the team contributed to our wiki.
Fundrising
The whole team have worked hard to organize funding.
