Step by step guide to synthetic cloning
Rationale behind the protocol
1. Cut DNA with one of the enzyme you want to use in cloning
2. Dephosphorylate 5' phosphate - this prevents DNA pieces from self-ligation
3. Cut DNA with the other of the enzyme you want to use in cloning
4. Run DNA on the gel
5. Extract vector and insert from the gel.
6. Ligate
7. After ligation some linear DNA may still remain, you can get rid of it by using recBCD exonuclease and Exonuclease I
Linear DNA is a perfect template for RCR amplification with phi 29 polymerase. It generates the long linear concatamers of the DNA from circular templates.
After 16 hours of amplification you have the DNA of your construct
This is how we did it
Our protocol:
1. Digest insert and vector with Fermentas Fast enzymes
insert with XBAI and at the same time add CIAP(Digest 1: 3ul reaction buffer; 1restriction enzyme; 5 ul DNA; 20ul water and 1ul CIAP), deactivate enzymes at 65C for 20 min, then digest insert  with PSTI(simply add 1ul of the enzyme).
vector with PSTI and at the same time add CIAP(Digest 1: 3ul reaction buffer; 1restriction enzyme; 5 ul DNA; 20ul water and 1ul CIAP), deactivate enzymes at 80C 20 min, then digest insert with SPEI(simply add 1ul of the enzyme)
Prepare Lithium-botare agarose gel.  Gels in LB buffer can be can run on much higher voltage we use 300-400V and gel is ready in 15 minutes. Theoretically maximum you can use is max. 100V/cm, but we never tried that much.
(1L 20 times concentrated LB gel buffer =>950 mL of dH2O, 8.392 g lithium hydroxide monohydrate; 36 g of boric acid; pH  8.2. Volume to 1 L)
Run the DNA on the gel and extract insert and vector
Ligate:7 ul H20; 5 ul insetr; 5 ul vector; 2 ul buffer; 0.5 ul Ligase incubate for 15 min at 25C
Perform exonuclease digestion (2,5 recBCD exonuclease buffer; 2ul ATP; 1ul recBCD (Epicentre) ; 1 exonuclease I (Fermentas); 1 ul ligation mixture; 17,5 h20. Inactivate the reaction at 80C for 20 min
3. Set up the annealing mix as described:
1ul of the reaction mix after exonuclease treatment
1ul Phi29 polymerase buffer
1ul PTO(phosphothioate protected) random RNA hexamers - 400umol, you can get them from IBA-GO
RNAse free water to 10ul
4. Set up the annealing reaction:
heat mix to 95C
cool down to 95C, slowly 0.1C/s works
5. to the annealing mix add :
1ul 10umol DNTPs - it is best to use RNAse free
1ul phi29 polymerase from Epicentre
2ul phi 29 buffer
1ul diluted Pyrophosphatase from Fermentas. Diluted 1:100 according to the manual
RNAse free water to 30ul final volume
6. Incubate at 30C for 16h
An excelent protocol on how to perform cell-free cloning is available here: Takahashi H, Yamamoto K, Ohtani T, Sugiyama S. Cell-free cloning using multiply-primed rolling circle amplification with modified RNA primers. Biotechniques. 2009 Jul.
Results of the cell-free cloning
5ul of the RC reaction were digested with Eco and PST. Insert and vector clearly visible, There are no unspecific products visible.
