The Video
This year, for the human practices portion of the iGEM competition, the Penn State team developed a video that explains synthetic biology in an understandable way for any general audience. This video is titled “(Re)designing Life” and addresses many topics surrounding the implementation and execution of synthetic biology. These topics include misconceptions generated by misinformation from the general public, the techniques used to perform synthetic biology, ethical issues surrounding genetic engineering research and the future applications of synthetic biology. Through this video, the Penn State team aimed to bridge the gap from the technical jargon used by today’s scientists and the general public understands of common biology. As a result, the misconceptions surrounding these technologies will be eliminated, opening a new relationship between synthetic biologists and the population they wish to improve through research.
Why This Video is Unique
While previous teams have made synthetic biology informational videos for their human practices project, this video differs not in content, but in audience. Most of the previous videos and workshops submitted to iGEM have been directed towards elementary and secondary schools, as well as college students. The Penn State team developed their video with the elderly in mind as the primary audience. The residents of Foxdale Village, a retirement community in State College, PA, were given the opportunity to view the video submitted by the Penn State team. The age range of these residents spanned about 40 years, from 65-104, a demographic previously ignored by the iGEM competition. From this viewing and a short discussion following the video, the residents were able to gain a better understanding of genetically modified organisms and their relation to synthetic biology.
Why the elderly?
In addition to their role as an untapped demographic, the elderly provide an open audience available to give feedback and opinions regarding the synthetic biology video. While the elderly population will have difficulty adding to the ever expanding technology that allows genetic engineering and synthetic biology, this demographic can still have a lasting impact on the scope of the scientific world. The elderly remain active in the political landscape through voting. According to the report summarizing the 2008 presidential election voting patterns, about 20% of all voters were above the age of 65, while only 10% were between 18-24. The latter age group has been well represented in previous iGEM human practices projects, but the former has yet to be reached. Until now…  GMOs are defined as any organism whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered through human intervention.
