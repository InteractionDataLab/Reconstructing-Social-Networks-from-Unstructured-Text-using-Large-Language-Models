Horace
CHAN Horace Ho Laam (BSc III),
two years of undergraduate studies in Biotechnology has made Horace fairly adapt at rote learning and memorisation. Not satisfied and looking to appreciate the biosciences to a greater extent, he sees iGEM as a great opportunity to apply what he learnt, to acquire some lab and teamwork skills, to develop a 'scientific mind', to gain insight into synthetic biology, to have some fun and to skip classes so he can (hopefully) pay a visit to MIT and meet some great people across the globe.
