We offer outstanding opportunities to learn and work with an exceptional faculty dedicated to providing a rich educational environment and exciting research atmosphere in biochemistry. We seek fundamental insights into the ways living systems function at the molecular level, and use multidisciplinary approaches to apply these insights in a biomedical context. As part of the Medical Faculty of the University of Hong Kong housed within brand new state-of-the-art research facilities, we have excellent opportunities to collaborate with medical colleagues to carry research discoveries in biochemistry right through to improved human health.
Our department has a history of innovation and tradition of excellence in both research and teaching. We compete internationally in research, providing excellent opportunities for our graduate students to learn in a collegial and stimulating atmosphere. The significant discoveries we make in a wide number of fields are frequently published in scientific journals of the highest caliber. We pay great attention to keeping our undergraduate education in biochemistry relevant to the most exciting fields of contemporary biomedical research and provide an excellent level of personal attention to each of our students, and have innovated in providing the only undergraduate degree in Bioinformatics in Hong Kong.
Overall, we feel that our department certainly offers the best atmosphere for learning and performing research in biochemistry in Hong Kong and China and competes well with the very best universities internationally. Furthermore, we believe the combination of our world-class faculty, research infrastructure and geographical location in one of the most exciting and fast-changing economies in the world provides exceptional and unique opportunities for the future.
