LI Yu Ting, Stephen (BSc II),
an undergraduate student majoring in Biochemistry and Biotechnology  and one of the principal investigators. Having past his first year of undergraduate studies, he found that he is truly fascinated by the biological world. After the acquisition of the basic biological knowledge, it seems to be the right time for him to take a step further to broaden his knowledge of practical biology. This desire also encourages him to participate in the iGEM competition. And iGEM, as an international competition, also provides the opportunity for him to meet scholars all over the world. All in all, he would say iGEM is not only a competition but also a place for him to learn and to explore.
