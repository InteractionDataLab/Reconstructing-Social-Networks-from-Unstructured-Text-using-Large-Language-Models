Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name the parts which you extract.
ε5 was empty and the products from the cloning of 12.08.11 contain GFP-pbd too.
Name of the parts: GFP-pbd 4 4 4, GFP-pbd 4 1 3, GFP-pbd 6 6 8, GFP-pbd 4 2 2
Describe your results and mistakes and measure the DNA concentration with the Nanodrop and note the results.
GFP-pbd 4 4 4: 164,1 ng/µl
GFP-pbd 4 1 3: 100,8 ng/µl
GFP-pbd 6 6 8: 163,5 ng/µl
GFP-pbd 4 2 2: 144,4 ng/µl
How did you label your probes and where are they stored?
Labelled GFP-pbd 4 4 4, GFP-pbd 4 1 3, GFP-pbd 6 6 8, GFP-pbd 4 2 2
