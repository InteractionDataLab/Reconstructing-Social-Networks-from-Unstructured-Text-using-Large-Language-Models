(Name) Sophie
Project Name: Blue light receptor: Ligation of Lovtap and Not-Gate
Gibson-Assembly
1. Prepare 5X ISO buffer. Six ml of this buffer can be prepared by combining the following:
3 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5150 μl of 2 M MgCl260 μl of 100 mM dGTP 60 μl of 100 mM dATP 60 μl of 100 mM dTTP60 μl of 100 mM dCTP300 μl of 1 M DTT 1.5 g PEG-8000300 μl of 100 mM NADAdd water to 6 ml Aliquot 100 μl and store at -20 °C
2. Prepare an assembly master mixture. This can be prepared by combining the following:
320 μl 5X ISO buffer0.64 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo20 μl of 2 U/μl Phusion pol160 μl of 40 U/μl Taq ligAdd water to 1.2 ml
Aliquot 15 μl and store at -20 °C. This assembly mixture can be stored at -20 °C for at least one year. The enzymes remain active following at least 10 freeze-thaw cycles. This is ideal for the assembly of DNA molecules with 20-150 bp overlaps. For DNA molecules overlapping by larger than 150 bp, prepare the assembly mixture by using 3.2 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo.
3. Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.
4. Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture. The DNA should be in equimolar amounts. Use 10-100 ng of each ~6 kb DNA fragment. For larger DNA segments, increasingly proportionate amounts of DNA should be added (e.g. 250 ng of each 150 kb DNA segment).
5. Incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min (60 min is optimal).
6. If cloning is desired, electroporate 1 μl of the assembly reaction into 30 μl electrocompetent E. coli.

Lysis cassette
Troubleshooting of the modified Lysis genes K124017
Investigators:Theo
The Ligated parts (M48+1 and M48+7) could not be transformed so it was decided to try again and wait until Monday for the sequencing.
In the meantime,
M48 is in an Amp Vector, part has to be sent to registry
The M48 stock was inoculated so that it could be mini-preped on Saturday
