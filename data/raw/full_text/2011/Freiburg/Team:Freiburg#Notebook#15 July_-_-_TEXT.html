Meeting
attendants: Tobi, Theo, Julia, Rüdiger, Jakob, Sandra
blue light receptor
already done:
Transformation of Lov-Tap in cells.
To-do:
Cloning of promotor (medium) in Lov-Tap part and perform a transformation. Plating out of the cells on trypthophan-free medium.
Quick change
Investigators: Theo
already done:
repressor part (BBa_K098995) has no bases between RBS (B0034) and start codon (K098997), resulting in no translation.
quickchange of the repressor part to insert 6bp between RBS and start codon
To-do:
DpnI digestion to digest the DNA template (methylated DNA) of the PCR to have only the new synthesized DNA strand.
After digestion with DpnI, transformation of cells with the corrected part (BBa_K08995)
Lysis cassette
Digestion of Quickchange

Quickchange PCR
Project Name: Correct number of nucleotides between RBS and ATG of temp. sensitive repressor from Lysis Device
4,5μl

4μl
Buffer, NEB4
4μl
BSA (10x)
1,5 μl
Enzym 1
DpnI
21 μl

Transformation
Name: Theo
Date: 15.07.2011
Continue from 15.07.2011 Digestion of Quickchange
Experiment
Project Name: Correct number of nucleotides between RBS and ATG of temp. sensitive repressor from Lysis Device
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
It was done in ordert to correct the number of nucleotides between RBS and ATG of the temperature sensitive repressor from our Lysis Device, ie to insert 6bp.
It didn’t work because the false DNA Template was taken (S15 - K124014 - instead of S11 - K098995 -).
This will be corrected by doing another Quickchange using S11 (ie K098995) as template.
