Meeting
attendants: Jakob, Julia, Manuel, Rüdiger, Sandra, Theo, Tobi
time: 9:30 - 11:00
green light receptor
already done:
CcaS: first quick change PCR removed the SpeI restriction site, EcoRI didn't work
CcaR: first quick change PCR didn't work (EcoRI restriction site not removed), wrong PCR program
To-do:
do the second quick change with the changed Ccas to remove the EcoRI restriction site
repeat the quick change with the CcaR
after the quick changes do a Gibson assembly with pcyA and ho1
in parallel do 3A-assemblies to create the same construct as a backup plan
blue light receptor
already done:
ordered new primers (the third pair)
first primer pair had the overhang, second without overhang, third primer pair now without overhang and position shifted
To-do:
try the gibson assembly again with the third primer pair
red light receptor
already done:
3A of pcyA and terminator sent for sequencing
cph8 was sent for sequencing
julia transformed the ompR promotor
To-do:
add a Promotor-RBS to the pcyA-Terminator
if the sequence is OK, amplify the part with the overhangs
add terminator and Promotor-RBS
do a miniprep of the ompR promotor
Lysis cassette
already done:
3A-assembly of the lysis casette
3A-assembly oth the GFP-PBD
quick change PCR of the lysis casette (11 bases to insert the RBS)
To-do:
do a miniprep from all three attempts
Precipitator
already done:
waiting for godot
To-do:
waiting for godot
other stuff
start creating nice pictures to explain your subproject and write text to explain the pictures
Sandra organized Freehand from the MPI, it is installed on both mac books
give-aways: digital postcard, real postcard, fluorescent protein
Tobi will ask at the financial department about the croud funding money
Rüdiger will get us more media attention
cooperation with other german teams: ask munich to do an appointment for a skype conforence about the light inducible promotors
cooperation with Upsala: find an appointment for the skype talk

To-do: Transformation
3 . T r a n s f o r m a t i o n
4.Picked some colonies
from transformation yesterday
To-do: pick colonies, do Miniprep
blue light receptor
Gradient PCR of Lovtap with new primer
Investigators: Sandra
Primer:
P38 (former name:P36) LOVdw
P42 LOVtap up
DNA template:
M35 (Lovtap)
PCR program:
"Lovtap ohne Überhänge" with temperature gradient during the annealing step from 50°C-60°C. The elongation step and the final elongation step were extended.
"cold":50°C
"warm":60°C
Comments: PCR did not work again. We will try to do 3A-assembly.
