green light receptor
Skypephoned with the iGEM-Team Uppsala
Investigators:Theo, Rüdiger, Jakob
We talked to two guys (Lei Sun and Hamid Gavali) from the igem team uppsala. They gave us some informations and support, quite nice guys.
Informations:
few Primer sequences
Touchdown-pcr protocol
Thx a lot for that!!!

32,5µl
H20
Name
10µl
5x Phusion Buffer
of Primer
2.5µl
Primer fw
2.5µl
Primer dw
1µl

Phusion (add in the end)
What program do you use? Normal PCR with 60°C annealing temperature
To confirm the PCR-Product has the correct size, load 2 µl of the sample onto an agarose-gel.
How did you label the PCR-Product, where is it stored and what do you do next?
red light receptor

NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Precipitator
Tramsformation with inducible Promoter
Investigators: Sophie We didn't get any clones with both Plastic binding domain and Promoter-RBS inside, the Pbd seems to be toxic when expressed.So we want to try if it is possible to get cells with an inducible Promoter and Pbd. In this case we could cultivate the cells and induce expression of the Pbd only shortly before lysis. As our Light-inducible Promoters are not finished we use the IPTG inducible Promoter BBa_J04500 (Plate4, 12A)
PCR
Investigators: Rüdiger
PCR of precipitator.
Primer fw:
p51
p52
p53
Primer dw:
p54
DNA template: S43
DMSO was used to reduce Tm about 5°C.
For the first a51, a52 and a53 6% DMSO was used. For b51, b52 and b53 9% Dmso was used. For c51, c52 and c53 12% Dmso was used.
Picking colonies
Investigators: Rüdiger
5 colonies were picked and incubated overnight in LB amp medium.
