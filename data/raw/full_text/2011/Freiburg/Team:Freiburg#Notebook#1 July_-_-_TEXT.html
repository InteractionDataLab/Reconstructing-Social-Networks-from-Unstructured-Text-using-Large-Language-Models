Plating out of cells transformed with cph8/pSB1T3
Investigators: Manuel
plated out cells, containg the vector pSB1T3 with cph8. They were then stored at 37°C in the incubator.
Lysis cassette
Miniprep of Lys1-5
Investigators: Theo, Sophie
Miniprep was performed of Lys1, Lys2, Lys3, Lys4 and Lys5 and the concentration was measured with NanoDrop. The undigested samples were then stored in the freezer for further experiments.
