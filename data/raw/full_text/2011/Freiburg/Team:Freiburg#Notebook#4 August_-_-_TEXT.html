Investigator: Jakob
5µl Buffer NEB4
5µl BSA (10x)

Quickchange
Project Name: Green light receptor CcaR
Documentation:
(qc) CcaR in pSB1C3 (Cm resistance)
Stored in the fridge
To-do: pick some colonies
Testdigest of mutated CcaS
Investigator: Julia
done a miniprep of the quickchanged CcaS-colonies.
The one CcaS (labeled qC1) was changed with Primer P14 and 15, in order to get rid of EcoRI.
It was digested with EcoRI.
The other CcaS with Primer 16 and 17, was performed to delete SpeI site.
The transformation gave more positive colonies so we have 11 samples.
They were digested with SpeI
