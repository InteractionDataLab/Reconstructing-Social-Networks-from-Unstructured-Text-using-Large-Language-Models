The little hoped for experiment II
Investigators:Theo
the picked colonies were preped, but because GATC doesn't work on Saturdays I made a restriction plan to see if I had the much sought after composite part.. I would cut with EcoRI, EcoRV and PstI and if i had both parts I would get 4 easy to see bands... If you take the theoretical sequence of BBa_K608351 + BBa_K608352 you will see what I mean... Anyway it did not work, I could barely see a second band.
on the new plate from yesterday there was a colony to be picked.. so I did exactly that
