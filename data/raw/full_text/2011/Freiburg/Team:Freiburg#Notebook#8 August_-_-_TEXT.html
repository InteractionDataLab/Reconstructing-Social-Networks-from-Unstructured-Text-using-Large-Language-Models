2. Digest with DpnI
Digest of the quickchange above
3. Transformation
Transformation from digest above
Note: I'm such a fool...forgot the gel...
blue light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
Lysis + RBS
Investigators:Theo
Sent samples for sequencing, Testdigestions of whole temperature sensitive cassette showed no correct inserts! (:()
Precipitator
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT: Cloning
Investigators: Sophie
continue from experiment: miniprep (the, 8.8.)
Project name: new 3A assembly with amp vector
Parts: psB1A3 (Eco & Pst)
GFP-pbd ( Xba & Pst)
PR4 or PR6 (Eco & Spe)
Why? The last cloning of Theo and Jakob produced one clone with GFP-pbd inside but without PR. So I'm trying again to clone with two different PRs with different RBS strenghts.
Stored in: "Minipreps, verdaut"-box
