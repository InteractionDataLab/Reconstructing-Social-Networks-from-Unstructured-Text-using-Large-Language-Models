blue light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
Lysis cassette sequencing
Investigators:Theo
Sequencing showed part of the E.coli genome inside the restriction sites where the lysis cassette should be (aaargh)
File:Lys1-P8.gb
Precipitator
new 3A assenbly with Amp Vector
Investigators: Sophie
3A assembly
The last cloning of Theo and Jakob produced one clone with GFP-plastic-binding-domain (GFP-pbd) inside but without Promoter-Ribosome-binding site (PR). So I tried again to combine the GFP-pbd with PRs via 3a assenbly. I used two different PRs (PR4 and PR6) with different RBS binding strenght. Name of the samples: ε5 (GFP-pbd), pSB1A3, PR4, PR6. stored in "Minipreps, verdaut"-box
Ligation
I ligated ε5 (GFP-pbd) to PR4 or PR6 and to the Amp-Vector. Therefore I once took the ratio 3:1 insert to vector and once the ration 1:1 insert to vector.
