I took the 3 cultures and prepared some tubes for them to test... I made measurements of the OD after about 18h of incubation at 30°C, put 1ml from every culture in an eppi (2 eppis for every culture) and incubated 3 of them at 30°C and 3 at 42°C. The results can be seen on our Project Results page or the Registry (Part BBa_K608351 and BBa_K608352).
After that, I sent the samples for sequencing hoping I would get the results the next day, but typical GATC decided to delay them until the 21st of September!!!

Experiment Digestion19.08. Rüdiger /Gelextraction (Theo)
Project Name:Precipitator
Procedure
PCR tube:
total volume 20 μl
add H2O (17 μl -X-Y-Z)
add 2 μl Ligase Buffer 10x
add Insert 1, Insert 2(when proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl of each)
add Vector (20ng needed. When proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl)
Add 1 μl T4-DNA Ligase
Incubate 10-30 min at room temperature
heat for 20 minutes at 80°C
store at -20°C or directly proceed to transformation
