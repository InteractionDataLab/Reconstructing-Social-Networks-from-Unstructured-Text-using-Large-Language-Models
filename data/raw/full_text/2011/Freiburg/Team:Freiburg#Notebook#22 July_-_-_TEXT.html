Describe your results and mistakes and measure the DNA concentration with the Nanodrop and note the results.
Mistakes: some lids broke
nanodrop labeling partly confused

DNA
DNA from todays Miniprep. See labeling there.
10 μl total volume
Give 3 μl of DNA in an eppi and add 7μl of the mastermix.
Incubate for about 1h at 37°C.
Add 1 μl Loading dye buffer and load the gel.
Take a picture of the gel, print picture and label the lanes!
Meeting
attendants: Jakob, Julia, Manuel, Ruediger, Sandra, Sophie, Theo (later), Tobi time: 9:00 - 10:30
green light receptor
already done:
CcaS was amplified again from the genomic DNA
To-do:
3-A-Assembly of CcaR into an empty vector with a medium promotor
3-A-Assembly of CcaS into an empty vector with a weak promotor
3-A-Assembly of CcaR and CcaS to get the final construct
blue light receptor
already done:
Primer-Design for the Gibson-Assembly
growth medium without tryptophane is already ordered
To-do:
amplify the NOT-Gate
red light receptor
already done:
one positive colony from the 3-A of ho1 and the terminator
no positive colony from the 3-A of pcyA and the terminator
the PCR to amplify cph8 didn't give a product, we asked the team from Mexico to send us the cph8
the team from Upsala (Sweden) has succeeded in amplifying the cph8 (according to their notebook)
To-do:
3-A-Assembly of the ho1-term with a mediumPromotor-mediumRBS
Lysis cassette
already done:
the quick change didn't work the first time, we should repeat this
possible alternative to express the lysis cassette could be: temperature regulated RNA
To-do:
repeat the quick change
Precipitator
already done:
the GFP-PBD was cloned (colonies showed up)
To-do:
test digest and sequencing of the GFP-PBD (first have a look if you see the GFP fluorescence)
possible test of the PBD: grow the E. coli, lyse them, put the lysate into a plate (96 well?), wash the wells to get rid of the other proteins, measure the GFP fluorescence with a plate reader
microscope the E. coli cells
other suff
think about possible give-aways for the sponsoring video
jacob will create a Youtube account and upload the sponsoring video
meeting for the wiki takeover: wednesday 9:00 am (new time: 12:15)
modelling should be started now, either Ni-binding and release or GFP-PBD binding and release, Ruediger will do this
