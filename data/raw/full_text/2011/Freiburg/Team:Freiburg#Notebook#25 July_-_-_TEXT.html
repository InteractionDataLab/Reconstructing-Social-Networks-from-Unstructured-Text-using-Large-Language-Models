Gibson Not-Gate:Transformation
Investigators: Sophie

Continue from Date Name
Experiment
Project Name: Blue light (NOT-Gate)
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
We need a NOT Gate for our Blue light system. In this experiment I transformed E.coli with the Part Bba_Q04400 from the iGEM distribution kit. The vector is pSBK3 with Kanamycin resistance. The strain ist named S 45 and will be plated out. The plates will be stored in the incubator.
PCR

Continue from Experiment: new experiment. We need NOT-Gate and LovTAP with Gibson-overhangs, so 2 PCRs are made

Phusion (add in the end)
What program do you use?
"57°C auf 70°C" (first annealing temperature:55°c, after 10 cycles 65°c)
To confirm the PCR-Product has the correct size, load 2 µl of the sample onto an agarose-gel.
How did you label the PCR-Product, where is it stored and what do you do next?
I labelled it with a heart and a star and stored it in the minipreps 3 box.
I will do Gibson assemblz of the two parts next.
DNA-concentration measured with nanodrop:

DNA-concentration (ng/μl)
S35
75.3
S45
27.2
We will repeat the PCr, because of the bad result of S35. We will do a PCR with higher temperature.

Experiment
Project Name:
Procedure
add H2O (38μl-DNA )
5 μl NEB4 buffer  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
5 μl 10x BSA  (used 1:10 diluted sample stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
DNA (500 ng) (Vector:Insert ratio 1:3 in following Ligation)
1 μl restriction enzymes  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
heat for 1-2 hours 37°C (6 hours if time)
heat for 20 minutes 80°C (inactivation of enzymes)
keep at 4°C if you cannot continue
Measured DNA-concentration with Nanodrop to calculate the volume of DNA to do the digestion:

3A Assembly of linearized empty Tet Vector Psb1T3, PR Parts S39, S43 (CM resistance) and GFP Pbd from PCR with P18,19,20
I did not digest linearized PsB1T3 with Dpn.
Run a gel to verify if the part is cut out.
