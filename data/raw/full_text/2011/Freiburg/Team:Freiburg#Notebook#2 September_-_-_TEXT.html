green light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
blue light receptor
MIniprep
Investigators: Sophie, Sandra
Miniprep of new ligated parts in pSB1C3 vector.
After miniprep samples were digested and loaded onto a gel. Not c has inserts:-)
1:2 not a has inserts too!
Digestion: 2A-assembly
Investigators: Sophie
Digestion of the PCR products Notgate, Lovtap for the 2A-assembly.
Ligation:2A-assembly
Investigators: Sandra
Ligation of the digested parts in the already digested vector pSB1C3. Ligation at room temperature over night.
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
3A Assembly of Quickchange-modified K098995 + modified Lysis genes K124017
Investigators:Theo
Sequencing of Part S66 (modified Lysis genes K124017) showed that it is a DNA fragment from our other projects, so another miniprep was done and sent for sequencing.
Miniprep data were good:
Concentration = 220ng/mikrol
260/280 = 2.04
260/230 = 2.19
No gel was run to see if there is a band!
Precipitator
Rüdiger 02.-05.09.
Trafo, colony picking & miniprep of ligations from 01.09.
Nothing worked
Another trafo done with same ligation. Found out that linearized C3 vector has no SpC1 restriction site.
Trafo
Investigators: Julia
Trafo of ligated parts:
pGEX vector (Amp. resistance)
pGEX vector (Amp. resistance)
pGEX vector (Amp. resistance)
pSB1C3
pET Duet vector (Amp. resistance)
pET Duet vector (Amp. resistance)

pSB1C3
Miniprep
Investigators: Sophie
miniprep of GFP-pbd with IPTG-inducible promoter. The pellets were green!!! So we finally got both promoter and plastic binding domain into a vector! We can make experiments with the pbd now.
