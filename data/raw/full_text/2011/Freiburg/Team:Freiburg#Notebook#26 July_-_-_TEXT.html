Experiment Ligation 26.07 Ruediger
Project Name: GFPPbd
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
Had only 6 tet plates -> put 100 μl of each sample on each plate
Incubator overnight for 30°C

Continue from Experiment : Quickchange V.3
Project Name: Lysis Cassette V.2 (3A assembly of quickchange-modified K098995 with Lysis genes K124017)
Procedure
add H2O (38μl-DNA )
5 μl NEB4 buffer  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
5 μl 10x BSA  (used 1:10 diluted sample stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
DNA (500 ng) (Vector:Insert ratio 1:3 in following Ligation)
1 μl restriction enzymes  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
heat for 1-2 hours 37°C (6 hours if time)
heat for 20 minutes 80°C (inactivation of enzymes)
keep at 4°C if you cannot continue
Restriction enzymes you need to cut the vector, insert1 and insert 2:

Ligation step of 3A assembly.
How to calculate ratios --> e.g. for K124017
Length of pSB1T3= ca 2200bp
Length of K124017+Vector= ca 4500bp
4500/2200= ca 2
So 2*3 µl (since 3:1 is needed) = 6 µl
