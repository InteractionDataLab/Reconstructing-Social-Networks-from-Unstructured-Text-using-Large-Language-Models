Digest of CcaR
Investigators: Jakob
10µl BSA
10µl NEB
2µl DpnI
38µl DNA
Digest for 2h at 37°C
Transformation of CcaR
Investigators: Jakob
Testdigest of quickchanged CcaS
Investigators: Julia
today I prepared 9 minipreps of the the quickchanged CcaS.
They were digested with EcoRI and loaded on a gel.
Those which are not cut twice were changed during PCR correctly.
We will send them for sequencing today.
gel loaded with: Ladder 1 kb, qS50 a,b,c,d , qS51 a, b, c, d
lower lane:Ladder 1 kb qS51 e
positive clones are qS50b and qS51a.
concentration of minpreps: qS50b: 88,6 ng/μl and qS51a: 81,1 ng/μl.
blue light receptor
Transformation
Investigators: Sandra
Repeat of the transformation from yesterday with the Lovtap-NotGate-pSB1A3 vector.

Project Name: Blue light
PCR-Mixture for one Reaction:
For a 50 µl reaction use
32,5µl
H20
Name
10µl
5x Phusion Buffer
of Primer
2.5µl
Primer fw
P24
2.5µl
Primer dw
P79
1µl
dNTPs
of Template DNA
1µl
DNA-Template
M45
0.5 µl
Phusion (add in the end)
What program do you use?
20 cycles with an annealing temperature of 65/68/71 ºC (gradient-PCR) and touchdown then 10 cycles with an annealing temperature of 65/70/75 ºC and touchdown
digested with DpnI
To confirm the PCR-Product has the correct size, load 2 µl of the sample onto an agarose-gel.
How did you label the PCR-Product, where is it stored and what do you do next?
the PCR-products are labelled Not, nOt and noT and are stored in the "unverdaute Minipreps II"-box (or in the Gibson box?) If Sequencing is correct, I will do a new 3A assembly with the LovTAP-PCR product and an Amp-vector next.
