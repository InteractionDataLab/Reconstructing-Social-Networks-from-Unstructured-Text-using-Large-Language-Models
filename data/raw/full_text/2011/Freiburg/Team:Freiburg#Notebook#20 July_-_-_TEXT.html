Continue from Experiment Digestion Date 19.07 Name Ruediger
Project Name: GFP Pbd
Procedure
PCR tube:
total volume 20 μl
add H2O (17 μl -X-Y-Z)
add 2 μl Ligase Buffer 10x
add Insert 1, Insert 2(when proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl of each)
add Vector (20ng needed. When proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl)
Add 1 μl T4-DNA Ligase
Incubate 10-30 min at room temperature
heat for 20 minutes at 80°C
store at -20°C or directly proceed to transformation

Continue from Experiment Ligation Date 19.07 Name Ruediger
Project Name: GFP Pbd
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
1 S39 + M14+P28+P18
2 S39 + M14+P28+P19
3 S39 + M14+P28+P20
4 S43 + M14+P28+P18
5 S43 + M14+P28+P19
