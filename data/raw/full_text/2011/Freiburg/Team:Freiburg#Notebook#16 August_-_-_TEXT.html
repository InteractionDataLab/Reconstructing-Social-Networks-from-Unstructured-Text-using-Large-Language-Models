blue light receptor
Picking clones
Investigators: Sandra
Picking clones of transformed cells with LovTAp, NotGate, pSB1T3.
red light receptor
continuing with PCR of cph8
Investigators:Julia
2µl of the PCR reaction from 15th Aug. were loaded onto a gel.
But there was no band. Jakob is going to repeat the PCR.

We got the information for the program and the primer sequences from the iGEM Team Uppsala Sweden.
Lysis cassette
2A Assembly like August 15
Investigators:Theo
This time I used all the amount of S15 plasmid DNA we had, did an overnight restriction and run the gel.
extraction as per SOP and ligation with S4 (cut with SpeI, PstI), Transformation in competent cells.
