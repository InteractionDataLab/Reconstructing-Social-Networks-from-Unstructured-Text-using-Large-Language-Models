Gel
Investigators: Sandra, Sophie
We loaded the PCR products of the vectors on a gel and measured the DNA concentration. DNA concentration were high and we diluted the vectors to get an endconcentration of 25ng/microl.

Results of Sequencing
Investigators:Julia
CcaS 4a2 seemed to miss about 20bp, CcaS 4b2 is correct.
Quickchange PCR of CcaS and CcaR
Investigators:Julia
in order to eliminate iGEM restriction sites of EcoRI within CcaS and CcaR, we designed mutagenesis primer and performed a quickchange PCR.
Protocol
total reaction volume is 50µl:
32,5 µl H2O
10 µl Phusion Buffer 5x
2,5 µl Primer up
2,5 µl Primer dw
1 µl DNA template, concentration has to be 5ng/µl
0,5 µl Phusion
Primer for CcaR:
ccaR_mut1_up: CCtcactaATGAGgATcCTTTTAGTGGAGG
ccaR_mut1_dw:CCTCCACTAAAAGgATcCTCATtagtgaGG
Primer for CcaS:
ccaS_mut1_up:CCGGGCCGAGgATcCTCTATGTCAATG
ccaS_mut1_dw:CATTGACATAGAGgATcCTCGGCCCGG
Primer for CcaS:
ccaS_mut2_up:GGACCAAAAACgAGTCGCACTGAATTAG
ccaS_mut2_dw:CTAATTCAGTGCGACTcGTTTTTGGTCC
blue light receptor
PCR of Lov-tap and Not-gate
Investigators: Sandra, Sophie
We repeated the PCR again, with higher temperatures this time. After PCR we digested with DpnI 37°C for 1 hour and then purified the DNA with PCR purifictaion kit. Afterwards we measured the DNA concentration and loaded 2 microl to a gel.

What program do you use?
"57°C auf 70°C" (first annealing temperature: 58°C and then after 10 cycles 68°C)
To confirm the PCR-Product has the correct size, load 2 µl of the sample onto an agarose-gel.
How did you label the PCR-Product, where is it stored and what do you do next?
