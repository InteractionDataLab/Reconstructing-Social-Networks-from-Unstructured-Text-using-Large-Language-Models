Precipitator
Miniprep
Investigators: Sophie
continue from: Transformation, 19.08.11
Testdigest showed, that cloning was not succesful. Seems that the vector was only partly digested, because only vector-bands were visible on gel. I will try it again with longer digestion times.
Miniprep
Investigators: Rüdiger
Miniprep of PET.DUET_1 vector.
Trafo
Name:Rüdiger
Date:20.08
Continue from Date 19.08. Name Rüdiger
Experiment Ligation
Project Name: Precipitator
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
Trying to get Precipitator into iGEM vector.
Did not work.
Investigators: Rüdiger
Transformation of precipitator(pSB1C3).
Trafo did not work.
