Meeting
attendants: Jakob, Julia, Manuel, Rüdiger, Sandra, Sophie, Theo
Time: 9:00 - 10:00
green light receptor
already done:
Ccas some colonies (check if positive)
CcaR still doesn't work
To-do:
cph8 still won't work, we should ask to get the original sequence
blue light receptor
already done:
receptor and NOT-Gate assembly
To-do:
add Promotor-RBS and terminator
red light receptor
already done:
Promotor-RBS-ho1-terminator ready
Promotor-RBS-pcyA-terminator ready
To-do:
receptor still doesn't work (not possible to amplify via a PCR)
Lysis cassette
already done:
quick change with the 11 bases didn't work
did a 3A assembly with the single parts
To-do:
Precipitator
already done:
finally the genes arrived
GST from the bioss toolkit can't be amplified from the supported vector, Rüdiger should do a positive control next time, if it still doesn't work he should get new primer pairs
To-do:
PBD + inducible promotor
other stuff
Hauke Busch recommended CellDesigner to Rüdiger to do the modelling, Rüdiger will download it and try to install it
modelling should be done for the precipitator, escpecially the Ni-Histidin-binding and for the plastic binding domain, maybe also the GST-Tag affinity
Tobi will organize moving the stuff out of the lab after the wiki freeze
Sandra will ask for the appointment to talk at the MPI
green light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
blue light receptor
Sandra, Sophie: primer design for NOT-gate to get NEH I restriction sites inside instead of Spe I. We can not cut with Spe because our trp-promoter contains Spe restriction sites.
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
2A Assembly Sequencing
Investigators:Theo
results came in: File:Lys17-P81208-2.gb  :(
what is to be seen is that the lysis genes are indeed cloned behind the RBS but because (as our instructor told us) the vector containing RBS was not treated with antarctic phosphatase, the small DNA part between SpeI and PstI digestion sites managed to wedge itself back in...
So for the next week I had to do the whole 2A assembly from the beginning (including waiting 1 day for the S15 stock to grow in order to prep).
IMPORTANT: be careful of ligations in 2A assemblies, use little vector and try to stay between 1:1 and 1:3 vector:insert ratios...  Notice: little vector means 20ng
Also, use phosphatase for 2A assemblies!!!
Precipitator
3A-assembly
Digestion
Name:Rüdiger
Date:19.08.
Continue from Date 19.08. Name Sophie, Sandra
Experiment Miniprep
Project Name:Precipitator
Procedure
add H2O (38μl-DNA )
5 μl NEB4 buffer  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
5 μl 10x BSA  (used 1:10 diluted sample stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
DNA (500 ng) (Vector:Insert ratio 1:3 in following Ligation)
1 μl restriction enzymes  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
heat for 1-2 hours 37°C (6 hours if time)
heat for 20 minutes 80°C (inactivation of enzymes)
keep at 4°C if you cannot continue
Measured DNA-concentration with Nanodrop to calculate the volume of DNA to do the digestion:

digested with EcoRI and PstI.
Gel extraction kit
Investigators: Theo
DNA fragments of the digestion( see above) were excised from the gel.
Ligation
Investigators: Rüdiger
Trying to ligate the precipitator (excised from the gel) in the pSB1C3 vector. Ratio of ligation: 1:3
