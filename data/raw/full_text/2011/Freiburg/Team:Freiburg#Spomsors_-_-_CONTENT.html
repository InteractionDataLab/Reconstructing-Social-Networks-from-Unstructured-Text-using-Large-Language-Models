These signals are regulated in a dynamic and complex way that is hard to study with present techniques. It is the goal of BIOSS to change this by developing a new research strategy that allows a better study of signalling events and may solve many open questions in the field of biological and medical signalling research.

The scientists participating in this Cluster of Excellence not only apply modern analytical methods and combine they also combine these with new synthetic procedures. This not only allows them to better understand biological signalling systems, but also allows reconstruction and controlling of part of these systems in a creative and unconventional way. The design of new types of molecules which can function as signal switches or detectors opens new horizons in research and applications.

Inspired by the motto ‘from analysis to synthesis’, BIOSS continues to advance the field of synthetic biology and to make it more applicable to signalling research. BIOSS plans to develop innovative therapeutic approaches in its new research foci: deregulated signalling in tumour cells and signal processes in and at membranes.

ATG:biosynthetics is your partner for planning, design, operation and control of
“INTEGRATIVE BIOTECH PROJECTS&quot; with high impact on NEW MARKETS for BIOECONOMY.
We are on a strong technological basis in SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY focusing on synthetic genes, gene
and gene cluster designs, multi-protein-expression and bio-molecule separation technologies.

(1) ATG:biosynthetics uses computational methods based on the proprietary evoMAG software package.
Optimal functional DNA sequence features of genes mostly are conflicting in target functions.

(2) ATG’s Synthetic Biology “Application Builder” tools is online available as a design tool
for setting up customer projects and providing genetic building blocks libraries.

(3) With the ACEMBL - technology ATG is focused on “Multiple Gene/ Protein Expression Systems”  
Multiple gene expression is available for E. coli, Baculovirus infected Insect cells and for Mammalian systems.

(4) Purification of bio-molecules can easily be performed with the MONOLITH - technology in
industrial scales.

HiSS Diagnostics GmbH was founded in 1989 in Freiburg im Breisgau. Originally, we had only products for the medical microbiology, immunology and quality assurance for medical laboratories from representative providers, mainly from the United States and the Netherlands into the German market.
 
Since 1991, our portfolio of antibodies for basic research in immunology, cancer research and neurology was expanded. Since that time, HiSS Diagnostics GmbH have made it?s name in this area and is looking forward until today, to a wide range of antibodies, ELISA systems and purification systems for molecular biology, immunology and cell biology.
Since 1999, we are manufacturers and produce under the brand name NOVITEC ® In-vitro diagnostic products for the medical microbiology. In addition to our in-vitro diagnostic products we distribute qualified products for quality assurance in the medical laboratories and reagents for basic research.
 
Our in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) products are rated in accordance with the IVD Directive 98/79 EC (risk analysis, data collection, manufacturing steps). As part of the registration as IVD manufacturers, a proper quality assurance system (based on the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) was established in June 1999 and registered to the relevant authority, the government in Freiburg (Reg No: DE/142108036).
Since 2001 we have selected distribution partners and serve markets in the most countries in Europe and overseas with our products.
In November 2005 we were able to add to our product line NOVITEC ® also a research reagents range. These products complete our offer for immunology and basic research.
 
We have finished our manufacturer's certification to ISO 13485:2003 under CMDCAS. For Certificates please contact us.

The Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics (MPI) in Freiburg, Germany, is an interdisciplinary research institute that conducts basic research in modern immunobiology and developmental biology. It was founded in 1961 as Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and is one of 80 institutions of the Max Planck Society.

The researchers of the MPI study the development of the immune system and analyse the genes and molecules which are important for its function. They also seek to establish which factors control the maturation of immune cells and how chemical changes of the DNA influence the immune defense.

In 2007, the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology added Epigenetics as a new research area. In 2010, the institute changed its name to Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics. The 1984 Nobel Prize-winning biologist Georges J. F. Köhler was a director of the institute from 1984 until his death in 1995.
