Lysis cassette
2A Assembly of the Lysis Cassette (S4+S15)
Investigators:Theo
Since 3A assemly doesn't want to help us, we are going to try a 2A Assembly of S4 with S15.
S4 is cut with SpeI and PstI.
S15 is cut with XbaI and PstI, and is to be run on a gel, cut, isolated, ligated with S4 and finally transformed in competent cells.
After the gel with S15 was run, I noticed there was no band to be seen and our instructor told me it was because I had not used a lot of DNA (500ng).
I am going to repeat this tomorrow.
