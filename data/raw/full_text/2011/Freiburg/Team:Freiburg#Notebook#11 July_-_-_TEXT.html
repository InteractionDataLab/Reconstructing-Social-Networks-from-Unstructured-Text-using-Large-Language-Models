Miniprep of Promotor-Ribosome-binding-site-constructs
Investigators: Sophie
As our PR-DNA run out Sophie inoculated LB with bacteria from our Glycerol-stocks and made two minipreps (a and b) per PR-strain The DNA-concentrations measured were (in ng/µL):
PR1a: 89,7 PR1b: 98,6
PR2a: 78,2 PR2b: 52,4
PR3a: 25,7 PR3b: 37,8
PR4a: 45,7 PR4b: 15,7
PR5a: 35,1 PR5b: 55,9
PR6a: 45,7 PR6b: 38,9
reg light receptor
Test-digest
Investigators: Julia
14 samples:
M30-M32, M 36-M38
S24-S29
Enzymes used:
Enzyme 1: EcoRI
Enzyme 2: PstI
Image of S24-S26: pcyA and S27-S29: cph8
Comments: No bands for M30-M32 and M36-M38. It should be repeated with a fresh gel.
Precipitator
Transformation
Investigators: Rüdiger To see the expression of the plastic-binding domain (pbd), the GFP-pbd plasmid was transformed in cells.
