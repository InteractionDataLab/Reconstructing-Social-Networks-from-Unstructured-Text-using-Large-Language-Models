Meeting
attendants: Julia, Manuel, Rüdiger, Sandra, Theo, Tobi Time: 9:00 - 11:00
green light receptor
already done:
Ccas has to sites where we need to do a mutagenesis (quick change), both were done seperately, but the no colonies showed up (wrong PCR program)
CcaR has one site where we need to do a mutagenesis (quick change), this has been done, colonies were growing
To-do:
miniprep, digestion and sequencing of the CcaR clones
do the Ccas PCR again
next steps would be the big assembly wiht pcyA
blue light receptor
already done:
PCR of Lov-tap and Not-gate. Not-gate sequencing was good. PCR of Lov-tap did not work the first time and the second time with the temperature gradient PCR
To-do:
creating new primer for the Lov-tap as the old ones had a high probabylity for secondary structures
red light receptor
already done:
waiting for cph8 from Mexico
for pcyA we did a new transformation from the original plasmid
To-do:
over night culture, miniprep and stock from the pcyA plates
3-A-Assembly of pcyA and Terminator
Lysis cassette
already done:
the quick change didn't work the first time (wrong template DNA)
second time went well, but the transformation was difficult (only 10 colonies)
To-do:
do the miniprep and the sequencing
Precipitator
already done:
GFP-PDB: cloning doesn't work only a few colonies
To-do:
ask again if the gene synthesis is done: Rüdiger
Gibson cloning with the GST-Tag, TEV-site and Promotor-RBS
other stuff
deadline for the parts: 10th of september
name all the files you upload on the wiki with the prefix Freiburg2011_
start documenting the lab stuff in the wiki
still missing: logo and text from hiss, MPI, Serva, Invitrogen
Modelling: Rüdiger will ask Simon if he can help us along
sponsoring give-aways: key tag, postcards, movie, pencils
Lab tracks: Tobi wants to try it
cooperation with Upsala: Yeahhh!
blue light receptor
Glycerol stocks of Not-Gate
Investigators: Sandra
M45d was sequenced and we did glycerol stocks of bacteria containing M45d.
Lysis cassette
Sequencing of Lysis Cassette V.2 (Quickchange-modified K098995 + Lysis genes K124017)
Test Sequencing showed that the parts were assembled correctly.
File #1: You can see the EcoRI, XbaI sites and also the Quickchange-modified K098995 as well as the XbaI-SpeI SCAR and the start of the Lysis genes K124017
File #2: You can see part of the Lysis genes K124017 and the SpeI and PstI sites

What can immediately be noticed is the absence of a RBS (ribosome binding site) between the lamba cI regulated Promotor (R0051 of K098995) and the holin ATG of K124017. This had skipped our attention at the planing phase and was a source of headaches during the next days... :)

Give 3 μl of DNA in an eppi and add 7μl of the mastermix.
Incubate for about 1h at 37°C.
Add 1 μl Loading dye buffer and load the gel.
Take a picture of the gel, print picture and label the lanes!
nothing worked, no GFP inserts seens anywhere. Gel picture was not saved by machine. -Sequencing: no GFP in constructs - retry by Theo.
