Meeting
attendants: Jakob, Julia, Manuel, Sandra, Sophie, Theo, Tobias
Time: 10:00 - 11:30
green light receptor
already done:
quick change with CcaR didn't work
colonies for pcyA and ho1
To-do:
order new primer for the quick change
cph8: we will use the primer and protocol from the Upsalla team
test if the colonies are positive
blue light receptor
already done:
PCR to amplifiy the receptor with new primer pair
To-do:
check if the PCR worked
red light receptor
already done:
To-do:
Lysis cassette
already done:
lysis cassette with RBS
colonies for the GFP-PBD
inducible promotor + PR done
To-do:
overnight culture of the GFP-PDB colonies, miniprep, test digest and sequencing
Precipitator
already done:
waiting for the genes
To-do: still more waiting to do
other stuff
only some teams/people replied to the code we sent around
Rüdiger will meet Hauke Busch who will help us along with the modelling
everyone should do a sketch for his iGEM parts and constructs (also a short text to explain the function of every part)
the skype talk to the Upsalla team was helpful: we exchanged the primer sequences and some further experiences we had with the parts and with iGEM itself
we still need the official OK that we can collect donation about the crowd funding
Tobi wants to contact some newspapers
we want to practice our talk in front of the MPI people and the bioss people, we should get appointments, Sandra wants to ask Miriam from the MPI if we could do the talk on friday 23rd or wednesday 28th
we still need to update the wiki gallery
green light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
blue light receptor
Gel of the PCR product: LovTAP
Investigators: Sandra
To confirm the PCR worked this time, we loaded the sample onto a gel. The size of the fragment should be 1000bp. The gel showed a band at 1000bp. We digested the PCR product with DpnI and then purified the DNA with the PCR purification kit to further use the PCR product for 3A-assembly.

Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name the parts which you extract.
Need the DNA concentration
Describe your results and mistakes and measure the DNA concentration with the Nanodrop and note the results. How did you label your probes and where are they stored?
