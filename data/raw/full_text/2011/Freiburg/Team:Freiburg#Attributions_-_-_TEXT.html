Cooperation
Team Uppsala Sweden
were the first iGEM team to take up the idea for the SynBioOath and spread it via their wiki > https://2011.igem.org/Team:Uppsala-Sweden/HumanPractice/Oath .
Attributions
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the team on this page.  They must distinguish work done by the team from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, graduate students, and postgraduate masters students.
Thus we declare that the planning and organization of an iGEM Team in Freiburg 2011 was done solely by us students. Furthermore,  the complete setup and installation of the lab, the wiki,  all the ideas for all areas of our project and all labwork  was exclusively done by the members of the iGEM Team Freiburg.
Sven Fischer
a short time team member who left us at an early state of the iGEM Project. Thanks to him, we could use the 3D protein prediction from DNA sequence web-tool I-TASSER http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/ with which we did the rational modelling for the Precipitator protein.
ATG:biosynthetics
The company sponsored us the synthesis of the Precipitator protein and additionally a sequence optimization, to adjust the codon usage in a way that there is just the right polymerase concentration on the RNA.
Tobias Knust
soldering of the LED Box for light induction of the light sensitive promotors.
Mathias Möhl
Came into our lab with his movie equipment and shot all the scenes with us. He also did all the clipping and the animations afterwards. Thanks a lot. The result is brilliant.
DIYbio community
the fundamental ideas for the Synbio Oath were developed by the community of DIYbiologists who met at the London conference in May 2011. We frequently contacted the community for feedback on our approach.
Contributions
Team iGEM-UANL_Mty-Mexico
we had the first conversation with Mexico about the light receptor idea and after we couldn't amplify the red light receptor from the registry they send us the Jeff Tabor Plasmid pJT122. Jeff Tabor also provided us information about the plasmid. Thanks for that!
Edinburgh (iGEM Team 2010)
as the blue light sensing system was not in the distribution kit, we contacted Dr. Christopher French from University of Edinburgh to help us and send the following parts:
BBa_K360121
RBS + LovTAP Photosensor + terminator
BBa_K322999
Blue light sensor (lovTAP) + Reporter system
plus a Trp promotor with mCherry reporter gene (all parts in pSB1C3)
