5.1 NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
green light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
blue light receptor
Testdigest
Investigators: Sophie, Sandra
Repeat of the testdigest of the ligated parts:
Lovtap
Not-Gate
pSB1A3
The expected size of the bands should be 2400bp and about 2000bp.
Miniprep
Investigators: Sandra
Miniprep of new 3A-assembly.
Samples were loaded onto a gel to verify the size of the samples.
The expected size: 4000bp.
The bands showed only a size of 1500bp.
The 3A-assembly did not work. Probably because of the Lovtap, since the sequencing of the Not-Gate was positive.
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
M48+GFP
Investigators:Theo
We started with a 3A assembly for the correct temperature sensitive promoter with GFP in order to test it.
Everything was done according to SOPs...
After 2 days there were no colonies...
Sophie decided to try it herself, since depression would start to grow big in me...
Precipitator
