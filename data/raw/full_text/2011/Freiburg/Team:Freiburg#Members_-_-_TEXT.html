Johannes Kaiser
Is a: Ph.D. in Biochemistry and the Manager of BIOSS
iGEM team role: Main supporter for funds and equipment
Tobias Knust
Is a: Ph.D. in Microbiology/Biochemistry
iGEM team role: Instructor of a team that does not need a instructor (ok, very little).
Is proud of: what the team has achieved.
Likes: my famlily, microbes and proteins
Philosophy: Anything is possible, with a little help from a friend.
Catch phrase: "Nein!" (aka "D'OH")
After finishing my Ph.D. thesis I joined the team as an instructor just before we began the lab work. We needed to settle in and build up the equipment in the empty lab. Since many things were missing at the beginning (e.g. PCR tubes), we could spent many hours discussing and improving the project.
I am lucky that I could join such a dedicated team of students being able to apply my skills in biochemistry, microbiology and bioinformatics and thereby helping the students in improving theirs. I never thought I could improve my skills so much while also having so much fun.
Hemin Faraidun
Is a: M.Sc in Molecular Biotechnology, PhD student studying molecular immunology
iGEM team role: Instructor
Is proud of: Having the oppertunity to learn from the team
Likes: Reading, watching movies and strangely Calligraphy
Philosophy: Simplicity is in the heart of every complex system, lets simplify
Catch phrase:
I knew about iGEM from enthusiastic students, the challenge and willing to do some thing new and scientifically attractive is not just an eye opening experience, but also encouraging to build up ideas and putting ideas in to action.
Manuel Hiß
Is a: Biologist (as written on my diploma)
iGEM team role: instructor
Is proud of:
Likes: Terry Pratchett, Katzenjammer, Hiking
Philosophy:
Catch phrase:
After attending the iGEM 2009 as a student I couldn't resist when I heard that the 2011 team from Freiburg was looking for an instructor. It's really great to see everything from the instructors side and I like the way the team has grown together.
Students
Rüdiger Trojok
Studies: Molecular and Cellular Biology
iGEM team role: Team founder; works on the Precipitator
Is proud of: genetical engineering
Likes: Travelling and Biology
Philosophy: is something people should think of more often
Catch phrase:
Synthetic Bio is the future technology.
It is our responsibility to make something good come out of it.
Rüdiger is the one who basically built up this years iGEM team. He had to talk to half of the biology faculty trying to organize a place where the project could take place. The years before Dr. Christian Müller was the leader of the iGEM teams of Freiburg and everything was performed in his lab, but after he moved to Potsdam, the iGEM team of Freiburg had to find a new place, a new suppervisor and so on. His motivation was contagious and he has a talent for keeping the overview thus being able to give instructions to people.The team wrote this description for him because he was too busy at the time modelling the precipitator.
Theodhor Tiko
Studies: Genetics, Bioinformatics, Immunology
iGEM team role: Provided assistance with founding the team; Works on establishing the lysis cassette; Always learning something from everyone on the team...
Is proud of: Being youthful at heart, hard-working and determined
Likes: Science, cycling and adventure... :P
Philosophy: Alexis Zorbas: Life is trouble. Only death is not. To be alive is to undo your belt and *look* for trouble.
Catch phrase: /Enter first goofy laugh sound that comes to mind.... \:D/
Rüdiger came up with the idea to found an igem team for the 2011 competition in September 2010 during our immunology course. It soon became clear that without the support from the old organizing lab, it would be a daunting task. So we (especially Rüdi) managed to obtain financing, a lab at the Max Planck Institute, equip it and then find the other members who would have enough motivation reserves for 6 months of nerve-racking, almost self-dependent lab work. Judging from the results, we were pretty successfull :)
Learning how to single-handedly organize a lab and keep it going, as well as simultaneously sharpening our teamwork skills and, most importantly, having a lot of fun has proved to be one the most important lessons during my studies.
Julia Müller
Studies:Biology
iGEM team role: master of 3a-assembly , always there to help,
contact-person for sponsors
Is proud of:being part of the team
Likes: sunshine, being on the racing bike
Philosophy: biology is not predictable
Catch phrase:Catch me if you can.
I have always been fascinated by Biology and have been curious about how living organisms function.
This was why I chose to study Biology.
Now, participating in the iGEM competition, we are given the chance to get to hands with these function by introducing
new features into living systems such as receptors for green and red light, which Jakob and I worked on over the summer.
I was a member of the team right from the start (since April we have been meeting up regularly)
and could therefore contribute to the organisation of the project. In the process of the build-up I was responsible for extra funding and managed to attract all the sponsors that you can see in the disclaimer below who helped us finance this project.
My speciality and important contribution to the project was the successful cloning into the linerazied pSB1T3-
vector, which is why I call myself the 3A-assembly master. It was not an easy task because of the many times
the results showed an unsuccessful cloning. Nevertheless we all tried again and again until we were rewarded with a successful result.
I can only agree with my team mates: working on this project over the whole summer, I have learned so much about
Synthetic Biology as well as organisation and the importance and all the benefits of team work! Great experience!
Sandra Wassner
Studies: biology
iGEM team role: blue light receptor
Is proud of: my Bachelor thesis, to be a member of iGEM
Likes: reading books, travelling
Philosophy: changes will only happen if we do the opposite of things we are used to
I study biology in Freiburg and I just finished my bachelor thesis when I heard that the iGEM team of Freiburg was looking for another team member. I was really happy to join them and support the team in the lab and with the wiki page. It is a really good opportunity for undergraduate students to improve their lab skills, their teamwork and also learn how to organize everything. With the autonomous work in the lab you get a lot more self-confident and self-consistent.
Sophie Cramer
Studies: Biology
iGEM team role: plastic binding domain; blue light receptor
Is proud of: I have done iGEM and my Bachelor thesis at once without my advisor noticing it
Likes: travelling, biking, cello music, experiments that work out
Philosophy: have fun at work
Catch phrase:
When I first heard about iGEM in my 4th semester, I was sold on the idea of being able to create my own little living machines, which would do something useful. So I did my best to find out how I could join the next year's iGEM team, which was not so easy because Rüdiger did not want the team to be flooded by Bachelor students like me ;). Nevertheless I finally convinced him and the others and worked as much as I could for iGEM while finishing my thesis. Now as the Bachelor's programme is completed, I will either stay in Freiburg and take a Master's degree in applied biology or go to Basel/Switzerland to complete a postgraduate course there.
Josef Csernalabics
Studies: Philosophy and Book-Sciences
iGEM team role: Human practices guy
Is proud of: An ability to keep cool if surrounded by panic
Likes: Books of all kinds, music with a tendency towards distorted guitars and coffee.
Philosophy: Yes, it already says so under 'Studies'
Catch phrase: [Expletive deleted]
I had learned about iGEM from Rüdiger in '09 and quickly got to following the developments with interest - i had been astonished of what students were attempting in their projects; so it is not really surprising that i was in right away when asked whether i'd lend a hand as part of this year's philosophy department for team Freiburg. It have been quite a few four-hour train rides by now, long hours in the lab, a lot of headaches over biological contexts i'd never heard of before but wanted to understand and the phrasing of the SynBioOath.... all worth it.
Jakob Käppler
Studies: Biology
iGEM team role: Is responsible for the green and red light receptors.
Is proud of: The things I learned since I joined the team.
Likes: The conversations and the work with this team in and outside of the lab.
Philosophy: One must imagine Sisyphus happy.
Catch phrase:
I just finished my 3rd year of the BSc degree in Freiburg and change now to the ESBS Strasbourg. The first time I heard about Synthetic biology and iGEM, was during my first year on the University. I decided to be part of an iGEM team at some day. So last February I took in hand and ask Ruediger... and lucky me... Sadly I couldnt stay in Freiburg so I just was able to work in the lab till the end of August, but nevertheless it was a great time and valuable experience I don't want to miss out.
Ilinca Tudose
Studies: Bioinformatics and System Biology
iGEM team role: some wiki assistance & occasional photographer
Is proud of: being a fast learner
Likes: the sea, silence, rains, animals, travelling, reading, making people feel happy and being good at something.
Philosophy: You are who you are when no one is looking
Catch phrase: I think
I first studied Computer Science in Romania and now I am almost finished with my master in Bioinformatics and System Biology in Freiburg. I joined the team in april as the computer scientist of the group and was supposed to do the Wiki and the mathematical modelling. I had to leave them by the end of July, due to a cool internship opportunity, so unfortunately that didn't leave us any time for the modelling part, nor enough for the Wiki. Even so, I am still grateful for the chance I was given to work with such dedicated and nice people.
