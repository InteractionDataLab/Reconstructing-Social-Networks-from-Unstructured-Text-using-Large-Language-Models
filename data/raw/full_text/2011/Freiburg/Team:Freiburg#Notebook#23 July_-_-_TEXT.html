Continue from 23.07.2011 Digestion of Quickchange V.3
Experiment
Project Name: Quickchange V.3 with correct lysis template
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
It was done in ordert to correct the number of nucleotides between RBS and ATG of the temperature sensitive repressor from our Lysis Device, ie to insert 6bp.
This time the correct DNA template was used, ie S11 (K098995). The backbone vector is psB1A3 (Amp resistance)
