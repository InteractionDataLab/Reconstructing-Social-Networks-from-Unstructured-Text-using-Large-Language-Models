green light receptor
transformation with reporter parts
Investigators:Julia
transformation with iGEM parts BBa_I15016 which is B0032.ECFP
and BBa_I15017 which is B0032.EYFP.
Tomorrow the green light promotor from PCR of 29_August should be inserted infront of the reporter proteins CFP and YFP.
blue light receptor
Miniprep
Investigators:Sophie
continue from: picking clones; 04.09.11
Testdigest showed no inserts
Ligation
Investigators: Sophie
again ligation as last time (02.08.11)
Lysis cassette
Troubleshooting of the modified Lysis genes K124017
Investigators:Theo
Minipreps of the first inoculations were applied on a 1% agarose gel without digesting them to see if they have an insert of the modified Lysis genes K124017. Nr1, 5 and 7 were sent for sequencing since the size seems to be about right.
Note: S4 is the B0034 RBS (ribosome binding site), S15 is the non-modified K124017 Lysis Cassette without RBS
Precipitator
Ligation
Name:Rüdiger
Date: 05.09.
Continue from Digestion Date 05.09 Name Rüdiger
Experiment
Project Name: Precipitator
Procedure
PCR tube:
total volume 20 μl
add H2O (17 μl -X-Y-Z)
add 2 μl Ligase Buffer 10x
add Insert 1, Insert 2(when proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl of each)
add Vector (20ng needed. When proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl)
Add 1 μl T4-DNA Ligase
Incubate 10-30 min at room temperature
heat for 20 minutes at 80°C
store at -20°C or directly proceed to transformation

Digestion
Name:Rüdiger
Date: 05.09.
Continue from Digestion Date 31.08. Name Rüdiger
Experiment
Project Name: Precipitator
Procedure
add H2O (38μl-DNA )
5 μl NEB4 buffer  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
5 μl 10x BSA  (used 1:10 diluted sample stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
DNA (500 ng) (Vector:Insert ratio 1:3 in following Ligation)
1 μl restriction enzymes  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
heat for 1-2 hours 37°C (6 hours if time)
heat for 20 minutes 80°C (inactivation of enzymes)
keep at 4°C if you cannot continue
Measured DNA-concentration with Nanodrop to calculate the volume of DNA to do the digestion:
Sample Name
DNA concentration (μg/μl)
Restriction enzymes you need to cut the vector, insert1 and insert 2:
Name
