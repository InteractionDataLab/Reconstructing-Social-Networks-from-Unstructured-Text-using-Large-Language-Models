PCR of pSB1A3 and pSB1C3
Investigators: Sandra
Primer:
P35
P36
Testdigest:
Expected bands:
pSB1A3: 2155 bp
pSB1C3: 2070 bp
green light receptor

blue light receptor
Miniprep
Investigators: Sandra
Miniprep of LovTAP-NotGate-pSB1A3.
After Miniprep the samples were digested with:
EcoRI
PstI
The testdigest showed no bands!
Trafo
Investigators: Sandra
Transformation of LovTAP-NotGate-pSB1A3 again, because the last transformation did not show good colonies to pick. Incubation over night.
Clones need to be picked tomorrow.
