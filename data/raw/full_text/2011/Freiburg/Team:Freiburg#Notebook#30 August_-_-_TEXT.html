Project Name: Blue light receptor: Ligation of Lovtap and Not-Gate
Gibson-Assembly
1. Prepare 5X ISO buffer. Six ml of this buffer can be prepared by combining the following:
3 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5150 μl of 2 M MgCl260 μl of 100 mM dGTP 60 μl of 100 mM dATP 60 μl of 100 mM dTTP60 μl of 100 mM dCTP300 μl of 1 M DTT 1.5 g PEG-8000300 μl of 100 mM NADAdd water to 6 ml Aliquot 100 μl and store at -20 °C
2. Prepare an assembly master mixture. This can be prepared by combining the following:
320 μl 5X ISO buffer0.64 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo20 μl of 2 U/μl Phusion pol160 μl of 40 U/μl Taq ligAdd water to 1.2 ml
Aliquot 15 μl and store at -20 °C. This assembly mixture can be stored at -20 °C for at least one year. The enzymes remain active following at least 10 freeze-thaw cycles. This is ideal for the assembly of DNA molecules with 20-150 bp overlaps. For DNA molecules overlapping by larger than 150 bp, prepare the assembly mixture by using 3.2 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo.
3. Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.
4. Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture. The DNA should be in equimolar amounts. Use 10-100 ng of each ~6 kb DNA fragment. For larger DNA segments, increasingly proportionate amounts of DNA should be added (e.g. 250 ng of each 150 kb DNA segment).
5. Incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min (60 min is optimal).
6. If cloning is desired, electroporate 1 μl of the assembly reaction into 30 μl electrocompetent E. coli.

Describe your results and mistakes. Did you digest it? Results?
See gel next day
>Did not work due to wrong DNA concentrations and no PCR purification
How did you label your samples and where are they stored?
Digestion this time the vector is dephosphorilated by antarctic phosphatase to avoid religation.

Experiment: new
Project Name:inducible promoter for pbd (iGEM standard)
Procedure
add H2O (38μl-DNA )
5 μl NEB4 buffer  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
5 μl 10x BSA  (used 1:10 diluted sample stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
DNA (500 ng) (Vector:Insert ratio 1:3 in following Ligation)
1 μl restriction enzymes  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
heat for 1-2 hours 37°C (6 hours if time)
add 5,6 μl antarctic phosphatase buffer and 1 μl antarctic phosphatase and incubate for another hour
heat for 20 minutes 80°C (inactivation of enzymes)
keep at 4°C if you cannot continue
Measured DNA-concentration with Nanodrop to calculate the volume of DNA to do the digestion:

Why are you doing this experiment? Where are the samples stored? Antibiotica resistance, vector used etc.
I want to be able to send the plastic binding domain to the registry and I want it to be expressible.
Stored in: “Minipreps, verdaut”-box
Resistance: Cm
