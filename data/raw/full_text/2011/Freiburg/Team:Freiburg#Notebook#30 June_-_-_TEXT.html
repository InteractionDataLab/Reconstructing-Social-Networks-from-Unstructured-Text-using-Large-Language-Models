1 green light receptor
1.1 Inoculation
2 red light receptor
2.1 3A-assembly: Ligation and transformation
2.2 Digestion, Ligation and transfomation
3 Precipitator
3.1 PCR of GFP and plastic-binding domain
green light receptor
Inoculation
Investigators: Sophie
inoculated LB with Ccas and Ccar parts that looked good on the gel:
S 17 (Ccar 1:1)
S 18 (Ccar 1:3)
S 20 (Ccas 1:3)
red light receptor
3A-assembly: Ligation and transformation
Investigators: Julia
Ligation of terminator and pycA/ho1 in pSB1C3
L4: ho1 (S22)
L5: pycA (S23)
...both ligated in pSB1C3 and then transformed in cells.
Comments: cells transformed with L4 have grown very good. There was only one colony of cells transformed with L5
Digestion, Ligation and transfomation
Investigators: Julia
Insert of cph8 (phytochrome) from PCR in the vector pSB1C3.
Digest of cph8:
Enzyme 1: EcorI
Enzyme 2: NsiI
Digest of vector pSB1T3:
Enzyme 1: EcorI
Enzyme 2: PstI
Enzyme 3: DpnI
Precipitator
PCR of GFP and plastic-binding domain
Investigators: Rüdiger
Primer:
P1: GFPxb1Iup
P3: GFPpdbSpedw
GFP: S14 (E0040)
