after analysing the samples, I found out that the composites had not worked as hoped (a lot of insertion elements... Sequences can be sent if you want to see it with your own two eyes :P) BUT the lysis genes+RBS was found again in Nr7.... So I decided to do a 2A assembly of the S48 and newly found S66 and just maybe be able to test the temp sensitive lysis cassette... The only problem was that the concentration of the new S66 was not that high and the 2 parts were in the same resistance vector.. So a gel prep had to be done... With only 500ng of S66 on the gel we could see almost no insert, but since this was our only chance, I cut what I thought was the insert band and did the Gel Prep kit. I had to go so Julia took over and because of my carelessness she had to stay until 2am in the lab to ligate and transform the samples.. Thank you Julia!!!! And sorry for once more :D
