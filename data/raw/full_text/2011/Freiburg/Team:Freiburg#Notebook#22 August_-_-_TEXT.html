After PCR: Digestion with DpnI in order to get of the old plasmids :
5 µl NEB buffer 4
5 µl BSA (10x)
2 µl DpnI
38 µl of PCR Product
Incubation for 1,5h, deactivation at 80°C  for 20 min.
Transformation with 10 µl of the digested PCR product. Cells were plated out on Kanamycin plates( at 23:00 o’clock ).
blue light receptor
Sequencing
Investigators: Sandra
The sequencing showed that the 3A-assembly did not work. We will send the LovTap PCR product to get sequenced. May be the PCR did not work.
PCR
Investigators: Sandra
PCR of Not-Gate.
P 74:
actgcagcggccgctgctagca
P 24:
tatgaattcgcggccgcttctag
PCR product was loaded onto a gel. Expected lane: 900bp
PCR worked and we got Not-Gate with NEHI and PstI.
Cloning
Investigators: Sophie
new 3A assembly with Sandra's NOT-gate-PCR-product, our LOV-Tap-pcr-product (both mutated with NEH1 restriction sites) and an amp-vector
The digested samples were loaded to a gel. They showed clear bands in the right size. Only the band of the vector was not intense enough, so the vector has to be digested again.

Precipitator
Transformation
Name:Rüdiger
Date:22.08
Continue from Date 19.08. Name Rüdiger
Experiment Ligation
Project Name: Precipitator
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.

Incubation over night.
Cloning for GFP-pbd with IPTG-inucible promoter
Investigator: Sophie
as cloning from 18.08.11 did not work I try it again with longer digestion times.

What program do you use?
Anneal Gradient from 61-72°c, 15sec.
To confirm the PCR-Product has the correct size, load 2 µl of the sample onto an agarose-gel.
How did you label the PCR-Product, where is it stored and what do you do next?
