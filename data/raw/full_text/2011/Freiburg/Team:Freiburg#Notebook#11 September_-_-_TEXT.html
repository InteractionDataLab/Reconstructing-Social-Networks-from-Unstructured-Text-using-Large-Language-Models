NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
blue light receptor
Picking clones
Investigators: Sandra
Miniprep + Gel
Investigators: Sandra
Stored in blue light box (6 samples).
expected lenght of Gibson-assembly product: 3902bp -> all Gibson assemblies were succesfull exept for G♥-d :)
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
M48 in C3 vector
Investigators:Theo
Part M48 in C3 Vector was inoculated (5 colonies picked from plate)
Transformation of all possible Lysis composites in C3 vectors
High throughput trafos just to be sure that if the sequencing works, I can send the parts in C3 vectors to the registry in time
Precipitator
