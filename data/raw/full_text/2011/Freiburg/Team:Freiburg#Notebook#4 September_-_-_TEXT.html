1 green light receptor
1.1 transformation
2 blue light receptor
2.1 picking clones
3 Lysis cassette
3.1 3A Assembly of Quickchange-modified K098995 + modified Lysis genes K124017
4 Precipitator
4.1 NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
green light receptor
transformation
Investigators:Theo
competent E.coli were transformed with 5mikroiter Ligation reaction from 3 September
blue light receptor
picking clones
Investigators:Sophie
No clone of the NOT-psB1C3-ligation grew. The ♥-psB1c3-ligation produced only 2 clones
Lysis cassette
3A Assembly of Quickchange-modified K098995 + modified Lysis genes K124017
Investigators:Theo
Another miniprep of the parts was done
S66 = modified Lysis genes K124017 in pSB1A2
GFP = E0040 in pSB1A2
S48 = Quickchange-modified K098995 in pSB1A2
S39 = Promotor (J23104) + RBS (B0034) in pSB1C3
As we thought, there is no band for S66, although there is DNA isolated from the mini-prep. It is probably a matter of making a stock from the false mini-prep. More answers on Monday or Tuesday
