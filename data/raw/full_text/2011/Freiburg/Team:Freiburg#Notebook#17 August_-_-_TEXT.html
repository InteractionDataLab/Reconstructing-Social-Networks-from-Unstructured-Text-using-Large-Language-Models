Experiment 3A assembly digestion
Project Name: new 3A assembly with amp-vector
Procedure
PCR tube:
total volume 20 μl
add H2O (17 μl -X-Y-Z)
add 2 μl Ligase Buffer 10x
add Insert 1, Insert 2(when proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl of each)
add Vector (20ng needed. When proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl)
Add 1 μl T4-DNA Ligase
Incubate 10-30 min at room temperature
heat for 20 minutes at 80°C
store at -20°C or directly proceed to transformation

Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Where are your parts stored? Name the parts for ligation etc.
Doing this cloning again because the Tet-vector makes problems.
Samples stored in Minipreps, verdaut-box and in Ligations-box
Name of the ligation-product: ♥-A3
Transformation
Name: Sophie

Continue from Date: 17.08.11 Name: Sophie
Experiment: Ligation
Project Name: new 3A assembly with Amp-vector, Blue light receptor
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
Name: ♥-A3
stored in incubator on Amp-plates
vector: psBA3
inserts: LovTAP, NOT-Gate
red light receptor
transformation
Investigators:Julia
transformed e.coli with the ligation products from 16th of Aug.
It should be "Promotor+RBS (1/2)+ pcyA+ terminator"
and
"Promotor+RBS (1/2)+ ho1+ terminator"
Investigators: Jakob
PCR from yesterday was negative
