1 green light receptor
1.1 Digestion of minipreps for the green light receptor
2 red light receptor
2.1 3A assembly:Digestion, Ligation and Transformation for the receptor
3 Precipitator
3.1 PCR of GFP fused to plastic-binding domain
green light receptor
Digestion of minipreps for the green light receptor
Investigators: Sophie
Digestion of minipreps:
S 17 (Ccar 1:1)
S 18 (Ccar 1:3)
S 19 (Ccas 1:1)
S 20 (Ccas 1:3)
S 21 (artificial terminator)
Enzyme 1: XbaI Enzyme 2: PstI
two gels were loaded.
Comments: S17, S18 and S20 were ok. S21 was not digested.
red light receptor
3A assembly:Digestion, Ligation and Transformation for the receptor
Investigators: Julia
Digestion of ho1, pcyA (chromophor) and terminator (pSB1AK3).
Ho1 and pcyA:
Enzyme 1: EcoRI
Enzyme 2: SpeI
Terminator part (pSB1AK3):
Enzyme 1: EcoRI
Enzyme 2: XbaI
ligated vector was then transformed in cells and plated out on chloramphenicol plates.
Comments: The terminator between ho1 and pycA was missing. The digestion was repeated on june, 29.
Precipitator
PCR of GFP fused to plastic-binding domain
Investigators: Sophie, Rüdiger
S 14: GFP
Primer:
GFPxb1Iup   (P1)
GFPpbdSpedw (P3)
Comments: PCR did not work, because of too high concentration of primers. PCR was repeated on june, 30
