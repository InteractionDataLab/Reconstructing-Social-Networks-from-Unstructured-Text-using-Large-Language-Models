green light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
blue light receptor
Picking clones
Investigators: Sandra
There were several clones on the cm plates. Clones were picked and incubated in LB cm medium at 37°C.
Gibson primer design
Investigators: Sophie, Sandra, Ruediger
we designed some new gibson primers for the assembly of NOT and LOV-tap in a vector because we are not sure if we can achieve this by 3A assemblies.
red light receptor
NAME OF YOUR EXPERIMENT
Investigators:NAME
Lysis cassette
3A Assembly of Quickchange-modified K098995 + modified Lysis genes K124017
Investigators:Theo
The digestion of the parts:
S66 = modified Lysis genes K124017 in pSB1A2
GFP = E0040 in pSB1A2
S48 = Quickchange-modified K098995 in pSB1A2
S39 = Promotor (J23104) + RBS (B0034) in pSB1C3
was run on the gel to see if the inserts are there.
There is no band for S66 so we sent it for sequencing
Precipitator

Continue from Date 31.08. Name Rüdiger
Experiment Digest
Project Name: Precipitator
Procedure
PCR tube:
total volume 20 μl
add H2O (17 μl -X-Y-Z)
add 2 μl Ligase Buffer 10x
add Insert 1, Insert 2(when proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl of each)
add Vector (20ng needed. When proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl)
Add 1 μl T4-DNA Ligase
Incubate 10-30 min at room temperature
heat for 20 minutes at 80°C
store at -20°C or directly proceed to transformation
