Meeting
9:30 - 11:00 Jakob, Julia, Manuel, Rüdiger, Sandra, Sophie, Theo
red light parts
after the test digest and the sequencing the next step would be to clone the parts behind the promotor-RBS
green light parts
after the test digest of Ccas and CcaR and the sequencing the next step would be to clone the parts behind the promotor-RBS
blue light parts
after the test digest and the sequencing the next step would be to clone the parts behind the promotor-RBS
precipitator
the gene sequences will be sent to ATG biosynthetics today
plastic binding domain (PBD)
the GFP was amplified via PCR and primers that contain the PBD, unfortunately the primers contained restriction sites for XbaI and SpeI
next step would be to take an plasmid with promotor-RBS and open it with SpeI, then combine this with the GFP-PBD and select enough colonies to catch a plasmid with the insert in the right direction (50:50 chance)
lysis part
the part we got after cloning the repressor behind a promotor-RBS is missing the scar after the RBS according to the sequencing results (6 bases)
next step would be to correct this error, possible solutions: large primers to amplifie the whole construct, short primers to amplify the repressor only, mutagenesis of the missing 6 nucleotides, solve it via gibson cloning
other stuff
notbook entrys should be updated from now on to the wiki
twitter should be updated (movie, etc..)
a weekly description of the accomplishments should be prepared
project description and safety sheet should be discussed on monday
on tuesday we visit the NGS presentation from Eurofins
we need a printer in the lab: Sophie wants to bring one from home, if this doesn't work Rüdiger will get one till tuesday
Rüdiger prepared some SOPs: gelextraction, miniprep, documentation of gels, you can find them on the snapserver in the folder iGEM/SOPs
Sandra prepared the 3A Assembly, Transformation SOP
still missing are: PCR, test digest, transformation, agarose gel electrophoresis
Test-digest and Gel
Jakob
Digestion and then a gel was loaded.
