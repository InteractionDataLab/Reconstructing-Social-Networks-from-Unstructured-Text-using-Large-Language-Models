Lysis cassette
high throughput sequencing dayII
Investigators:Theo
GATC Biotech GmbH really disappointed us by not delivering on their promise of overnight sequencing... One day lost for most of the team... Difficult decision: should we send the new Lysis parts in C3 as well or wait a couple of days and risk not being able to send them to the registry afterwards... Decision made (magic8ball) and we sent around 80 or 90 samples for sequencing!!! Including M48+1 and 7 as well as just 1 and 7
