Until the Jamboree:
Welcome to the FreiGEM2011 Team Page!
Team
Meet the team of young and enthusiasthic Freiburger scientists who decided to team up for this year's greates quest: iGEM 2011.

Project
We aim to transform protein expression in bacterial systems into an elegant, fast and affordable process. By eliminating routine use of expensive materials, this novel assay will utilize sustainable laboratory equipment and widespread His-Tag technology.

The Code
As mentioned at the Meeting in Carmona we are planning to develop a code for our community:
Here we present you the nearly finished aspirational code developed at the DIYbio European Congress in London, on the 8th of May.
Know you don’t know everything
Recognize the complexity and dynamics of living systems and our responsibility towards them
Respect humans and all living systems
Listen and respond to concerns
Adopt safe practices
Enjoy your work
Strive to increase public understanding of the methods, results and implications of the 21st century biology
Emphasize the sharing of ideas, knowledge, data and results
This  code draft was created by several young scientists and amateur biology enthusiasts. We all had the feeling that public perception of our intentions and actions are distorted and that these need to be clarified.For example, many journalists linked us in top articles with bioterrorism which is completely wrong and neither helps us or the public opinion about science in general.
We want to present ourselves to the public the way we are and hope that this honest and upright approach can change opinions. Furthermore, we plan to create an active, free and open international community for biologists and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, travel around to learn from others and to help and teach each other. For this community we need a recognizable and distinct appearance. We have considered a code, or an oath which we would voluntarily make, clearly telling everyone who we are, what we want and do not want and what we are doing. This will provide the appearance to increase the value and reputation of the biologist in general.
The Code above is simply a starting point to find a common ground. It needs to be elaborated upon and there will probably be several sub codes of conduct in the future,which will be adapted to local needs and laws.
iGEM would be a good forum to promote the idea among scientists and public and build a long lasting community. It has to be emphasized here, that this code should become universal for all biologists, not only restricted to iGEM or the DIYbio community. This will guarantee longevity and a bigger impact of the code and the community in future.
If you are interested in joining the effort to further develop this important code, please contact us!
