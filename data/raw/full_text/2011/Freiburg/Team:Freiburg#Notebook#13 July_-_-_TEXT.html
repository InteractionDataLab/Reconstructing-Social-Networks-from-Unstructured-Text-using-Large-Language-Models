red light receptor
Investigators: Julia
Waiting for sequencing results of parts BBa_I15008 and BBa_I15009. Julia did Minipreps of single colonies with PCR-ampilfied Chp8 in pSB1T3. She also did a test digest to see if the insert is in the vector.
Miniprep
Investigators: Jakob
Miniprep of cph8 from M30109 in pSB1T3 DNA concentration was measured with NanoDrop:

Testdigest
Investigators: Julia
Testdigest of cph8
Enzyme 1: EcoRI
Enzyme 2: PstI
Transformation
Investigators: Julia
Transformation of BBa_I15010 (in the vector pSB2K3) in cells. Sophie plated out the cells.
Comments: No colonies grew on the plates.
PCR
Investigators: Julia
New PCR for red light receptor.
Primer:
P10
P11
DNA template:
M30109
Comments: There were no bands on the gel.
Precipitator
Miniprep
Investigators: Sophie, Sandra
Comments: Ligation, transformation and picking of the clones was done before the miniprep was performed.
Miniprep of the plastik-binding domain: There were always picked two colonies of the same plate (sample and sample*).
