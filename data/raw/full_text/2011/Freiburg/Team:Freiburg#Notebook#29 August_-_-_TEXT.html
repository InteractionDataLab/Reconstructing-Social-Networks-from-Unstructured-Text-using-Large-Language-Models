What program do you use?
 
To confirm the PCR-Product has the correct size, load 2 µl of the sample onto an agarose-gel.
 
the lane labeled P, is the PCR product.Expected size: 264 bp
Testdigest of quickchanged CcaR and Precipitator
Investigators:Julia,with help of the team
3μl of the Miniprep were digested with EcoRI and PstI.
we are going to sequence the Precipitator samples 61a and b
(wrong labeling on the pic, its the 63 in the right corner)
62 b and f
63 c and d
and of the green light response regulator qCcaR 17b and 18a
blue light receptor
3A-assembly
Investigators: Sandra
Digestion I:
Lovtap
Not-Gate
pSB1A3
pSB1T3
stored in the blue light box.
Ligation
♥-A3 Not
♥-A3 nOt
♥-A3 noT
♥-T3 Not
♥-T3 nOt
♥-T3 noT
stored in the ligation box.
Digestion II:
Also digestion with new amplified vector
pSB1C3
Lovtap was digested again this time also with DpnI. So for this ligation the ♥-PCR3A, digested with DpnI, and pSB1C3 (new amplified with PCR, already digested with DpnI) and Not, nOt, noT were used.
♥-C3 Not
♥-C3 nOt
♥-C3 noT
Transformation
Investigators: Sophie
transformation of:
♥-A3 Not
♥-A3 nOt
