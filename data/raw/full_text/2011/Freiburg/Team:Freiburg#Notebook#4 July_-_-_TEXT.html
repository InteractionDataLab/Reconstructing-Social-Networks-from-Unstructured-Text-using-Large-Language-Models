1 green light receptor
1.1 Digestion of PCR products
2 Lysis cassette
2.1 Sequencing
3 Precipitator
3.1 3A-assembly: Digestion of plastic-binding site and GFP
green light receptor
Digestion of PCR products
Investigators: Julia
Digest of PCR product Ccas.
Ccas:
Enzyme 1: XbaI

Comments: RFP is not digested with SpeI and PstI. It was digested again, that time with NEB4 and XbaI.
Lysis cassette
Sequencing
Investigators: Theo
