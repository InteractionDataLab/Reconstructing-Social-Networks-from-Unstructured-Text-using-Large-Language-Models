green light receptor
Qickchange PCR of CcaS
Investigators:Julia
repeating experiment from___, because we had no positive transformation, probably chosen wrong annealing temperature before.
blue light receptor
PCR
Investigators: Sophie
As our last PCRs of the LovTAP with the Gibson overhangs didn't work well, we now try a PCR with primers without overhangs for Gibson assembly.

3A-assembly with pcyA and the terminator BBa_1006
Investigators:Julia
1.Digestion:
terminator (S21a), 26µl of the miniprep+ 12,1 µl H2O, cut with XbaI&PstI
pcyA (part BBa_I15009), 3 µl of miniprep + 35µl H2O, cut with EcoRI&SpeI
Vector-backbone (10 µl) pSB1T3, cut with EcoRI,PstI & DpnI
to each reation 5µl BSA(10x) and 5µl NEB buffer4 were added, digested at 37°C for two hours, inactivated at 80°C for 20min.
2.Ligation
2µl of digested pcyA,terminator and vector were added to 11µl H2O,2µl ligase buffer and 1µl T4 ligase.
Incubated at room temperature for 35 min, inactivated at 80°C for 20 min.

Project Name: Phage Lysis Cassette (K124017) + RBS (B0034)
Procedure
add H2O (38μl-DNA )
5 μl NEB4 buffer  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
5 μl 10x BSA  (used 1:10 diluted sample stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
DNA (500 ng) (Vector:Insert ratio 1:3 in following Ligation)
1 μl restriction enzymes  (stored at iGEM’s, -20°C)
heat for 1-2 hours 37°C (6 hours if time)
heat for 20 minutes 80°C (inactivation of enzymes)
keep at 4°C if you cannot continue
Restriction enzymes you need to cut the vector, insert1 and insert 2:

Why are you doing this experiment? Where are the samples stored? Antibiotica resistance, vector used etc.
A RBS (ribosome binding site) between the lamba cI regulated Promotor (R0051 of K098995) and the holin ATG of K124017 is absent. So a 3A assembly had to be performed in order to get a functioning Lysis cassette.
Resistance of RBS (B0034)=Cm and of Phage Lysis Cassette (K124017)=Amp, so the Vector is Tet (pSB1T3)

Project Name: Phage Lysis Cassette (K124017) + RBS (B0034) Ligation
Procedure
PCR tube:
total volume 20 μl
add H2O (17 μl -X-Y-Z)
add 2 μl Ligase Buffer 10x
add Insert 1, Insert 2(when proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl of each)
add Vector (20ng needed. When proceeding from 3A digestion use 2 μl)
Add 1 μl T4-DNA Ligase
Incubate 10-30 min at room temperature
heat for 20 minutes at 80°C
store at -20°C or directly proceed to transformation

Ligation step of 3A assembly.
How to calculate ratios --> e.g. for K124017
Length of pSB1T3= ca 2200bp
Length of K124017+Vector= ca 4500bp
4500/2200= ca 2
So 2*3 µl (since 3:1 is needed) = 6 µl

Project Name: Phage Lysis Cassette (K124017) + RBS (B0034)
Procedure
take cells from -80°C freezer and put them on ice! (every eppi contains about 400 μl cells)
thaw cells on ice 20 minutes
pipette 50 μl cells and 2 μl DNA into eppi still on ice!
Incubate for 30 minutes on ice
Heat at 42°C for 60 sec
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 200 μl LB Broth
Incubate for 2 hours at 37°C (cells with lysis cassette at 30°C!!)
Plate 50 μl and 200μl on two different LB/Agar plates with appropriate antibiotic resistance
Documentation:
Why are you doing this experiment? Name of the sample? Where are they stored? Name the vector with inserts, antibiotika resistance etc.
New Composite Part in pSB1T3 Vector with modified K124017 containing a strong RBS in front of first ATG
RESULT: No colonies!!! :( Probably because of the Tet vector, since other members of the group also had problems. We are trying it again with the pSB1C3 Vector
