Precipitator
Precipitator Ruediger
inoculated cells from yesterdays plating. All 12 plates had colonies. I picked 2 from each plate. Incubation at 37°C overnight at 300rpm.
further Project plan
if GFP Pdb works, I will pick best affinity Pbd and use it for the precipitator.
I will also need a primer for the Precipitator with a GST tag and a TEV cleavage site [1] inbetween.
Need to order a GST column (GST-4B) for the ÄKTA as well as PreScission Protease GST
check toolbox plasmid for pGEX-6P
check affinity calculation programs Scatchand plots and Klötz (to estimate Ni-Precipitator binding)
data for these calculations could be generated with ultrafiltration of the protein bound to nickel, to see how much nickel goes through - can be tested chemically
300ml E.coli culture needed for protein purification in ÄKTA
first there will be the GST affinity purification of the lysate of the E. coli culture -> Precipitator will be in the eluate
second a digestion of the eluate with the Cleavage enzyme
third another GST affinity purification -> Precipitator will be in the flowthrough
