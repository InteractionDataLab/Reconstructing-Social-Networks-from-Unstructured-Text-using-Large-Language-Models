List of "broken" parts
Lysis device
K098995 : 6 nt missing between RBS and the cI repressor possibly leading to a diminished expression (not tested.)
We are trying to insert the 6 nt and test the part again.
K112022 : Sequencing with VF primer did not work, digest shows unwanted pattern
K124014 : has several issues:
it’s not the holin 105 gene but it resembles part K124017
There are two AA exchange mutations in the holin 105 gene compared to the sequence submitted for K124017 .
The wrong prefix was used what will finally lead to a RBS-ATG distance of 8 instead of 6 nucleotides
The overall structure of the submitted sequence is likely the amplified original lysis gen cluster of the bacteriophage lambda without any modifications. We try to utilize it for our experiments, maybe we need to change the prefix, doing it by simply amplifying it with the correct prefix and re-clone it into pSB1C3
Light receptors
M30109 : The composite (red light receptor) is simply not what it should be.
Only the gene for chp8 is present in the plasmid, as already outlined in the experience page.
I15010 : should have been the original chp8 gen, but sequence is completely …
K360121 : the LOVTap (blue light receptor) and it derivatives were not send from the registry
They were kindly provided by Dr. Chris E. French (University of Edinburgh).
K360051 : CcaS (green light receptor) is not yet available from the registry.
We are trying to build the green light response cascade from the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genomic DNA.
