Purification
Investigators: Julia
Purification of digested PCR products with the PCR purification-Kit.
Ligation of Ccas in pSB1C3
Investigators: Julia
Ligated Ccas and pSB1C3 and then transformed the cells with the ligated vector.
Transformation of PCR product Ccas
Investigators: Jakob
Comments: Colonies had to be picked.
blue light receptor
Transformation of Lov-Tap
Investigators: Jakob
Lov-Tap1 (blue light sensor (BBa_K360121) in pSB1C3)
Lov-Tap2 (Trp promotor with mcherry reporter gene in pSB1C3)
Lov-Tap3 (Lov-Tap plus Trp promotor with mcherry reporter gene in pSB1C3)
Precipitator
Gel of digested parts and ligation
Investigators: Rügiger
Gel of digested parts:
Vector: pSB1K3
GFP-plastic-binding-domain
Promotor-RBS (PR1-PR6)
Comments: GFP was excised. Other inserts were not stained properly.
