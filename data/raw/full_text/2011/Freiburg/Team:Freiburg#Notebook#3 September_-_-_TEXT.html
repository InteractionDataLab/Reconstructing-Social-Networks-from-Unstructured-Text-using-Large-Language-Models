Testdigestion of 2a-assembly
Investigators: Julia
Continuing from 31 of Aug. [1]
Before Miniprep of 20 different colonies.
Each minipreped DNA-sample (3μl)was digested with EcoRI and PstI.
Result:
the samples
46b= ho1 with a RBS (BBa_B0034)
50b= RBS(BBa_B0034)+pcyA+terminator
64b= Promotor (BBa_J23110)+CcaS
67b= Promotor (BBa_J23110)+CcaR
were send on 6.09 to GATC for sequencing
3A-assembly:Digestion
Investigators: Sandra
Digestion of:
InsertI:
64, CcaR
46, ho1
with EcorI and SpeI
InsertII:
67, CcaS
50, pcyA
with XbaI and PstI
For this assembly we used the constructs from the 2A-assembly made on 31.08
Incubation for 6 hours at 37°C. Vector pSB1C3 was already digested,
it was just treated with antarctic phosphatase for one hour.
3A-assembly:Ligation
Investigators: Julia
blue light receptor
Stop of ligation
Investigators: Sandra
Inactivation of ligase at 80°C for 20 minutes.
Stored in the blue light box, labelled: ♥C3 Lig., and Not C3 Lig.
To do: Trafo
Transformation
with ♥C3 Lig. and Not C3 Lig
Investigator: Sophie

Precipitator
Picking clones
Investigators: Sandra
Only few colonies grew on two plates. These clones were picked and incubated in LB with amp at 37°C.
