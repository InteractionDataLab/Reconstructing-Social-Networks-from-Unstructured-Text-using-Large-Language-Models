What we did
We used standard parts from the Registry from the Gronigen Team (K190015: ArsR-regulated promoter) and the Endy Lab (E0840: GFP-generator) and from the MIT 2006 Team (J45119: Wintergreen generator).  We made two composite parts with the ArsR-regulated promoter and the GFP-generator or the Wintergreen generator.  We then joined them together to make our device which scientifically detects arsenic by a green fluorescent glow and warns about arsenic with a wintergreen smell, in case you don't have any scientific equipment.
