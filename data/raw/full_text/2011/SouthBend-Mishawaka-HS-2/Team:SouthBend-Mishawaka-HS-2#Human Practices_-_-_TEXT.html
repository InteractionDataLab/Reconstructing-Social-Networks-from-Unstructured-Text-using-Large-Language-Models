In order to find a solution, one must first have a problem. Some of the problems we tackled included genetically engineered machine awareness, arsenic contamination, and safety.
We are aware that the community is not familiar with the science behind iGEM. Once our device is completed, we plan to take the knowledge learned in the lab to the area's high schools. Already more awareness has spread, but there will be more awareness when our team members spread the word about iGEM.
Our team focused on creating a device that can benefit societies that have had arsenic contamination. Our device is made to be used in the real world.
From the beginning of the project up to the very end, all team members took precautions in order to protect human safety. Our project does not not raise issues on safety.
