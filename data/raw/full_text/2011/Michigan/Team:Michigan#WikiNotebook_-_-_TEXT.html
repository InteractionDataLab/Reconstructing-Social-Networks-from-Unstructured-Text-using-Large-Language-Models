Wiki has been given a makeover. Please note any bugs or suggestions and append them to this list:
Bugs:
⇒Calendar doesn't fit in content section on notebook page. Fixed 6/22/11. Edited width in calendar HTML code and centered via HTML.
⇒You must actually click on text of buttons to follow links in nav menu.
⇒Left menu covers itself with 3 or more drop down items.
⇒Protocols page using different standard template.
Browsers to be tested:
⇒IE 6/7/8/9
⇒Firefox
⇒Already tested in Chrome.

Updated Wiki again. Collapsed iGEM heading, removed header image, but retained space for the editing menu bars (all through CSS overrides, easily reversible in case of problems). Opened up main content area, which fixed the Google Calendar problem.
Todo:
⇒Add a little panel off to the right of the screen with standard iGEM logo that says "Return to iGEM Main"
⇒Fix top Wiki menu coloring and borders
⇒Add a team Gallery page
⇒Pick another font for content area.
