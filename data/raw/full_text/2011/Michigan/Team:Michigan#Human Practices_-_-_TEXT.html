Human Practices Notebook
5/11/11
Millie, Kevin, Candy
First Human Practices meeting! Discussed board game design.
Decided to model our game after LIFE and Monopoly.
Purpose: to educate the public about synthetic biology concepts.
Main Strategy: to move around the board and collect various parts to build one final product.
Goal: to be the first player to make the device.
Also added fun surprises and twists to the game.
Created GoogleDoc to ask for suggestions from MSBT members for our "Chance" cards (cards soon to be titled under a different name).

Millie, Kevin, Candy, Alena, Max, and Josh
Further discussion of the Board Game.
Members brought up new ideas and also discussed old ideas to generate clear understanding of the goals and purpose of the board game.
Researched the partsregistry.org website to look for parts the players could use during the board game.

I will log in hours for all members in attendance at the Human Practices Meeting
Board Game: Personal notes can be found at the "Human Practices Board Game Design" Google Doc here [1] . We discussed possible board game titles and "chance card" titles, the graphic design, how to create the cards, possible story situations, and a "parts registry bank" (similar to the Monopoly bank).
We also created a rough copy of the board game layout here [2] . Ignore the Pringle man in the left-hand corner haha. He is not part of the board game.
Interviews At the beginning of the month, I mentioned holding interviews to observe a wide variety of opinions from both the public and iGEM members, and our notes can be found here [3] . Feel free to add more questions which follow the format under the headings on the document - we can use all the questions we can. We're going to hopefully get in contact with the Michigan Psychology department and reduce the amount of bias in our questions; biased questions happen, so we want to try and prevent it as much as we can.

Interviews We worked on the Google Docs documents and created more Interview questions. We also went over methods to reduce bias of interview questions. See our progress here: [4]
The rough timeline for our project:
June: Finish interviews (6/8) and conduct them until end of June. Then gather data. Board Game – work on graphic design. Finalize storyboard, game rules, and board game layout. Gather material and find means to create “chance” cards (possibly game pieces?) July: Continue conducting interviews. Continue graphic design and finalizing board game technical stuff (rules, gameplay).  August: Compile all the interview data and create a visually appealing form of the data. Continue Graphic Design.  Mid-Aug: Manually construct the board game and pieces.

Board Game Added descriptions to playing card items.

9/7/11
Set up an MSBT table at the Festifall event at U of M. Passed out brochures and spoke with interested students. However, it rained throughout the entire Festifall, so it was not very successful. Considered our last surveying event.
Leading up until deadline
Finished working on survey data and on the board game.
The image of the board game actual board can be seen here: [5]
Playing cards can be seen here, however, the upload to the Google Docs eliminated all colors, formatting, and backgrounds, so this is not a true representation: [6]
An unfinished copy of the gameplay manual can also be seen here: [7]
Screenshot images of the Survey Results powerpoint can be seen here (it is not a screenshot of the entire powerpoint, simply results for notebook purposes): [8]
Raw Survey Data can be seen here: [9]
