Run through for abstract and scheduling:
Start with plasmid with taq gene and pst1 site
Remove pst1 site from taq coding sequence
In order to remove the restriction site, do site directed mutagenesis (1day)
PCR
Digestion
Transformation
Screening (1day)
Dilute DNA
Colony PCR individually
Digestion of PCR product with pst1
Run gel ~2500bp
Add biobrick prefix/suffix to taq coding sequence
PCR and add the prefix and suffix as primers (one prefix has an extra AG-make sure to use the correct one) (1-2 days)
Run gel
Cut out of gel
Cut with restriction enzyme
Clean up DNA
Ligation with vector (could be vector with the terminator sequence, promoter and RBS)
Transformation
Add a promoter, transcriptional terminator, ribosome binding site (RBS)
Screen colonies (1 day)
Colony PCR
Restriction Digestion
Clean up DNA
Sequence (1 day)
Make taq protein
Compare it to other enzymes and make sure it works
