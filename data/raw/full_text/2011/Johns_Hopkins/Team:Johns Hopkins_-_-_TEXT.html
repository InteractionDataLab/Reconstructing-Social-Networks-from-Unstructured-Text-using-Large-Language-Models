The Johns Hopkins University has issued a press release about our team (and created a video for our project!), and we are featured on the front page of the university's main site as well!
We have also received IRB approval for distributing surveys in two Baltimore markets! We hope to have preliminary results on the public perception of genetically modified foods by the World Championship Jamboree.
