Designed the multiple cloning site substitution and QuickChange protocol. For site-directed mutagenesis, primers must be completely complementary to each other with the base change in the exact middle of the primer. 15-20 bp of homology on either side of the base change is ideal. For a large bp substitution (in this case, the replacement of a multiple cloning site), the primers need regions of homology on both the 5' and 3' strands (5' for primer 1, 3' for primer 2) on either side of the site of the change, with the desired sequence change complementary in both primers.

Problem may be in incompatible PCR buffer (Herculase buffer) and Transformation buffer. Solution is to do PCR purification before transformation.
Check theory by running PCR purification on PCR products that previously failed transformation and re-transform

Restriction Digest results: We are looking for 1 band here: linearization of the vector. The - sign after the vector names means it has completed site directed mutagenesis QCPCR. It can go on to the final QCPCR, multiple cloning site swap.

Looking for alternating uncut/cut bands. This is because we cut with a restriction enzyme in the old multiple cloning site before we substituted in the BioBrick MCS. The other band is a restriction enzyme site present in the final version of the vector. The results were not conclusive, so we had to redigest all of the created vectors. See the results section for the final results.
