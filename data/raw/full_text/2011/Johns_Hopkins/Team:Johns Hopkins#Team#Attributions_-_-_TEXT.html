Equipment and materials
Violacein oligonucleotides were supplied by the Boeke lab .
A strain of yeast containing genes from X. dendrorhous on which our beta-carotene production building blocks are based was provided by the Ooyen lab. See Verwaal R, Wang J, Meijnen JP, et al. High-level production of beta-carotene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by successive transformation with carotenogenic genes from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 2007;73(13):4342–4350.
We thank Dr. Tom Ellis ( http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ellis ) for providing yeast plasmids and advice for quantifying the transcriptional strengths of our yeast promoter BioBricks.
