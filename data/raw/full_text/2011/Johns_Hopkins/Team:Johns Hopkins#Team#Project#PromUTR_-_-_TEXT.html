Promoters and UTRs
As we began our work with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it came to our attention that the database is deficient in genes for this organism. This deficiency is due in part to the fact that E. coli genes are widespread through the database, whereas yeast remains a largely untapped area. In order to address this problem and facilitate the use of yeast in synthetic biology we have decided to provide the basic parts required for gene use and assembly. Dr. Jef Boeke has provided some basic parts including promoters and termination sequences of varying strengths. This will allow future teams the ease of use of premade biobricked sequences to use with their genes.
Promoters
Yeast promoter sequences of varying strength have been provided for our work. The following are the available promoters: ARD1p, BAP2p, FCY2p, Gal 1/10p, HHO1p, KRE9p, PRY1p, RPL8Ap, RPL24Ap, RPS2p, RPS8Bp, STM1p, TDH3p
UTRs
Similarly, the following UTRs, or termination sequences have been provided for our work: ARD1utr, BAP2utr, FCY2utr, HHo1utr, KRE9utr, PRY1utr, RPL8Autr, RPL24Autr, RPS2utr, RPS8Butr, STM1utr, TDH3utr
