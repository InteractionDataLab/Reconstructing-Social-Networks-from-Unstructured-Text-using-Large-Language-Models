Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Our team project is aimed to create a graphical user interface for designers of synthetic biosystems. This tool will help them in their design process by simulating the system. Because this project is a software, our team is not directly concerned and do not raise safety issues.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We have made no BioBrick parts or devices.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
We are studying engineer sciences and more specifically microelectronics. In this field we don't have any local biosafety group because we are not concerned by biosafety issues in our daily activities.
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
We have to respect the bioethics law of our contry, France.
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Because we did not feel directly concerned by safety issues in our project, we have not been thinking about how to improve the safety.
