Safety
Because of the restructuration of the team, it was a great challenge to have all the iGEM requirements, but because we cannot cut ourselves in 4 people, the task repartition was easier to do! This fact explained the lenght of this part...
Behavioral
The behavioral version of the software was developed by the students:
The whole team has worked to have VHDL models, validated by the instructors, then students have realized the file generation part in C++, the GUI, and have integrated the file generation into the GUI to have a complete program.
Conservative
Concerning the conservative version, the instructiors have created the VHDL-AMS models, because of the specificities of the VHDL-AMS language, and the team has then integrated those models into the software, helped mainly by Yves Gendrault.
This Wiki
This wiki has been realized by the team, students advised by instructors.
