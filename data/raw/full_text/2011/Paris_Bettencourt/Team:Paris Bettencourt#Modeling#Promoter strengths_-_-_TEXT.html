Justification for the promoter strengths values
When creating our models, we used few different promoters. Rather than lose a long time searching for the exact (and often contradictory) values for their strengths, we chose to give them an arbitrary value of 0.02 for all our experiments. This corresponded roughly to what the iGEM 2009 Aberdeen team measured. The only exception was the ComS design where we used the values found in INSERT ARTICLE NAME. The plan was to then evaluate all our promoters relatively to each other and adjust our values afterwards. However, due to the very short time we had this summer and the faulty pHyperSpank promoter we received from the Registry, we were not able to properly compare our promoters in time for the wiki freeze. Our models are still valid and this should only impact on the actual stability levels, not on the global behaviour.
