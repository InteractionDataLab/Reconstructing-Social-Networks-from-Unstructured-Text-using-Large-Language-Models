Figure 3. Intercellular Nanotubes Form  between Neighboring B. subtilis Cells
(A–D) PY79 cells were grown to midexponential phase, plated on LB agar, incubated for 6 hr at 37° C, and visualized by HR-SEM.
(A) A typical ﬁeld of B. subtilis cells (315,000). Green arrows indicate intercellular nanotubes connecting neighboring cells. The scale bar represents 5 mm.
(B) A higher-magniﬁcation image (340,000) of the boxed region in (A). Membrane bulging is indicated by an asterisk (*). The scale bar represents 500 nm.
(C) An additional ﬁeld of cells demonstrating the occurrence of a network of intercellular nanotubes (350,000). The scale bar represents 1 mm.
(D) A ﬁeld of cells where a cluster of smaller nanotubes (highlighted by a dashed circle) as well as a more pronounced larger tube (indicated by an arrow) are apparent (3100,000). The scale bar represents 500 nm.
(E) An immuno-EM section of cocultured PY79 (gfp-) and SB444 (gfp+) cells, stained with anti-GFP and secondary gold-conjugated antibodies. Black dots indicate the expression and localization of GFP molecules. The scale bar represents 200 nm.
(F) A magniﬁcation of the dashed square in (E). The arrow highlights the ﬂow of GFP molecules within a tube. The scale bar represents 200 nm.
(G) An additional example of an immuno-EM section, showing the localization of a GFP molecule within a tube, as indicated by an arrow. The scale bar represents 200 nm.
