Data page
The YFP concentration system
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - YFP:tetR recombinant fusion protein, BBa_K606025:  It's a recombinant fusion protein composed of Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) and Tetracycline Repressor Protein (tetR) that can bind to the tet operator sequence (tetO).
Main Page - TetO Array, BBa_K606026: 10kb of Tet operator sequence. YFP:tetR will bind to it and concentrate the fluorescence.
Main Page - pVeg+SpoVG- YFP:tetR- Double Terminator , BBa_K606027: The YFP:tetR expression system.
Data for Pre-existing Parts
Main Page - pVeg + SpoVG, BBa_K143053: promoter and RBS for B. subtilis (Imperial College, iGEM 2008)
Main Page - Double standard terminator, BBa_B0015: standard double terminator

The T7 polymerase diffusion system
Data for our favorite new parts
Experience - pVeg SpoVG T7 SpoVG RFP double terminator, BBa_K606039: T7 and RFP under constitutive promoter pVeg + SpoVG, emitter system to “send” the T7 polymerase.
Experience - pT7 SpoVG T7 SpoVG GFP T7terminator, BBa_K606036: T7 and GFP under a pT7 promoter to response a emission of T7.

The tRNA Amber diffusion system
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - Promoter Hyperspank, BBa_K606040: IPTG Inducible promoter shortened compared to the one that was before in the registry.
Main Page - pHyperspank Tyrosine amber supressor tRNA double terminator, BBa_K606041: system for using the tRNA in a IPTG inducible system.
Main Page - Tyrosine amber supressor tRNA for subtilis, BBa_K606034: tRNA tyrosine amber compatible with both B. subtilis and E. coli.
Main Page - T7 amber, BBa_K606032: This T7 polymerase contains two amber mutation to be a good receiver in a emitter/receiver system with a Tyrosine tRNA amber.
Main Page - T7 amber with autoamplification loop, BBa_K606064

The ComS diffusion system
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - ComS gene, BBa_K606037: The comS gene can trigger the MecA/ComS/ComK system. The start and stop codon has been changed for more standard codons.
Main Page - ComS gene Codon optimized, BBa_K606038: This is the same gene than the previous one, but it has been synthetized de novo.
