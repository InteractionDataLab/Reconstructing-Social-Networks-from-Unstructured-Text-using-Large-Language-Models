Bonus track
The exploitation of the two coponent system OmpR can be exploited in the case of a B. Subtilis, E. Coli nanotube communication through the periplasm. This is the working hypothesis.
To do this experiment, we need a Envz* (always active) OmpR- E. Coli Strain. The principle is basically the same than the MBP diffusion system, but it is simpler. The principle is summed up in the scheme below:
The principle of the OmpR Signaling System
