We are working in the <A href="http://www.necker.fr/tamara/pages/people.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">U1001 research unit</A> which is shared between INSERM (National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and <A href="http://app.parisdescartes.fr/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Labs.woa/wa/showInfoLabo?cle=20101353#ficheLabo" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Paris Descartes University</A>. It is fully equipped for bacterial genetics and molecular biology work in terms of material and people having the competence to do the research. The lab is monitored on regular basis by security officers of both the Paris Descartes University and the INSERM.
Our team is under daily supervision of primarily Ariel Lindner, Senior Research Scientist in U1001. We receive regular help as well from Chantal Lotton (Engineer and Hygiene and Security Correspondent) as well from two Ph.D students Yifan Yang and Antoine Decrulle, both working on site. The whole lab team is also here at times to explain and advise us.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Would_the_materials_used_in_your_project_and.2For_your_final_product_pose:"> Would the materials used in your project and/or your final product pose:</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="a._Risks_to_the_safety_and_health_of_team_members_or_others_in_the_lab.3F">a. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others in the lab?</SPAN></H3><P><I><B>Bacillus subtilis</B></I> is a gram-positive bacteria, rod-shaped, aerobic, sporulating ( very resistant spores: heat, dessication etc.). It is ubiquitous in the environment and it is not usually a human pathogen. It is considered a <B>Level 1 Biosafety Containment Agent</B> which goes according to the following definition: &quot;Agents of no or minimal hazard under ordinary conditions of handling&quot; <A href="http://www.unm.edu/~sheaweb/sheamanual/biosfty/BIOSAFA-pg3.01-A7only.htm" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A>.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the litterature with contact to <I>B.subtilis</I> autolysates. Symptoms: asthma, skin inflammation (dermatitis), lung inflammation (pneumotitis) but it is very rare hence manipulation with gloves and a lab coat is respected.</P><P><I><B>Escherichia coli</B></I>: we use DH5a and K12 which are common laboratory strains<A href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/E._coli_genotypes" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</A>, also considered as  <B>Level 1 Biosafety Containment agent</B>. 
In our different sub-projects, we will not further exacerbate the already weak pathogenicity of <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>: our different designs are aimed at proving the existence and caracterising the nanotubes. It ensues from fundamental research that was published earlier this year. It focuses on a natural phenonemon that <I>B.subtilis</I> seems to exhibit in period of stress.
To this end, we are going to use different antibiotic resistance as well as Green Fluroescent Protein variants to observe under the microscope the transfer of molecules. These two first designs use non conjugative plasmids. Albeit their resistance they do not pose any risks to the safety and health of the team/lab members since the constructs are under IPTG induction. 
Other, mainly amplifiers in emitter-receptor systems or fluorescent proteins to monitor the expression of genes (See the <A href="/Designs" title="Designs">Designs</A> page) are used in the other sub-projects of characterization. Hence, we will not use or modify toxins (that <I>B.subtilis</I> does not naturally have <A href="http://epa.gov/biotech_rule/pubs/fra/fra009.htm" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[3]</A>) nor any potentially dangerous metabolites that could be present in this species. On the contrary, we aim at using external inducers such as hyperspank promoters (IPTG inducible) and orthogonal systems (such as T7 promoters) or even non natural systems (T7 amber suppressor tRNA) thus limiting risks to both the team and lab members .
In the very unlikely event (see section above) of an infection by either bacterium, a treatment with regular antibiotics is sufficient, antibiotics that are also natural.

If anything they would have a disadvantage for overproducing useless metabolites such as GFP, their competitiveness is decreased. Any kind of horizontal transfer risks is taken into acount with the use of non-conjugative plasmids and under external inducers.

In essence, there are information and rules concerning cleanliness and important reflexes to have; it treats on how to sterilize and wash contaminated material. There is also a part concerning hazardous situations (electrical, chemical, ionizing, fire etc.) and how to deal with them, who to contact, how to deal with dangerous situations as well as your rights and obligations such as the one to refuse to enter your workplace if there is potential threat to your place and the obligation to contact the director and the Head Safety Officer of the INSERM that will emit the final judging. A good point is always to tell your hierarchy superior and the lab security officer.

The information about biosafety in the lab presented here have been gathered during the introduction made by the Correspondant of Hygiene and Security (<A href="http://www.necker.fr/irnem/units/search.php?iduser=1950&amp;pass=1" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Chantal Lotton</A>) to the safe use of each instrument and machine as well as general guidelines of good lab practice. All the students in the team participated to this introduction. The handling of waste, how to keep things sterile, how to use the hood etc. was also explained to us.In our team, there are also two designated <I>lab managers</I> that are notably in charge of knowing the functioning of each apparatus and of the security issues; team's students had, as a mandatory part of their undergraduate curriculum, a Hygiene and Security course. In case any problems arise Chantal Lotton, the lab's security officer,  can be contacted 24H/24H to seek help and/or advice. Furthermore, weekly team meetings with our supervisors allow for any concerns to be raised and treated.

Rule n°2 : Don't smoke or eat or drink in the lab.
Rule n°3 : Don't wear scarves and tie your hair back if needed. Wear coat when it’s not so hot.
Rule n°4 : Don't leave any personal belongs (phone...) because of thiefs.
Rule n°5 : Don't work ALONE at night and during the weekend (and inform the on-call guard of your presence).
Rule n°6 : Be careful, products may be harmful even if they seem inoffensive.
Rule n°7 : Identify your stuff (iGEM + date + if sterile) and CLEAN UP once you've finished.
Rule n°8 : Tell us if something is running out so that we can buy them in advance.
Rule n°9 : Close both lab doors before leaving.
Final rule : Turn off all the machines before leaving (especially the bain marie, 
because of fire and surtension problems in this lab!). Check that -20°C and -80°C are OK every morning.
