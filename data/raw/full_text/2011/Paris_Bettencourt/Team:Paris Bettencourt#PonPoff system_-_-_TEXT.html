Bonus track
The idea of this design is to trigger the changement of state of the Push-on Push-off switch of the 2011 Pekin team by a RecA emitted by the neighboring cell. The syste, has to be build in a microfluidic device in order to create IPTG pulse, or trigger the change by glucose pulse.
The principle is summed up in the image below:
Principle of the RecA triggered Push-on Push-off
