Individual presentation
Biology students
Adrien Lhomme-Duchadeuil
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Descartes University
As far as I can recall I was always immersed in Sciences  and multi-culturalism. Following a bilingual education in France,  I obtained an Honours Bachelor of Science in Anthroplogy and  in Biology from the University of Toronto. Drawing from such a  wide education, I really wish to participate in the iGEM  competition so that I can bring to the team my biology skills and  my anthroplogical knowledge. I want to seize the opportunity  and contribute to this new adventure that synthetic biology is.
Axel Séguret
Master1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
After many talks with some teachers, I had the wish to  participate in the iGEM competition. The idea of life engineering  seems to me very interesting. To create standards could  simplify experiments and all shares. We are not yet researchers  but we have the ambition to achieve a research project end to  end. Finally, iGEM contributes to the development of synthetic  biology, while attempting to demystify the image of science. I  think science is accessible to people that get caught into the  game.
Camille Huet de Froberville
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
It's in the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), I discovered and enjoyed really, Synthetic and  Systems Biology in a multidisciplinary and international  atmosphere that fitted me well. It's also during my master that I  heard about iGEM. It's for me, a unique opportunity to work in a  lab and to be confronted to its management. Moreover it allows  to completely get involved in a project that is ours from the  emerging idea to its realisation. Last, iGEM needs us to surpass  ourselves. That's something that motivates me a lot : pushing  further our limits to accomplish something that we can be proud  of.
Edward Kwarteng
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Descartes University
iGEM competition is the platform for young researchers to develop  their talents in such a world competition. Participating in iGEM  competition will give me the opportunity to think of a scientific  problem and design how to  solve it autonomously with  colleagues from different disciplines. It will enhance my  capabilities to work in a group and share ideas with fellows.  Synthetic biology is a great tool for future discoveries and i see  iGEM as the gateway for me to develop interest and equip  myself in this upcoming field of science.
Laura Da Silva
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
While having a bachelor's degree in Biology of Lyon 1  University, physics and computer science have always  interested me. iGEM meaning interdisciplinarity: the mixture of  all basic sciences, represents, in my mind, a unique opportunity.  It is an adventure not only from the personal point of view:  working and setting up a team with students from different  backgrounds and interacting on different views of Life Sciences  induced, but also from a professional point of view: to have the  possibility at our study level to take part in the creation and in  the development by ourselves of our own scientific project, so  means a source of intellectual enrichment, at which I am willing  to take part.
Mathias Toulouze
Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University
I am very impatient thinking about this competition. According to  me, it is a special opportunity offered to us. Indeed, in the  course of this competition we will have to  leverage our creativity, our passion for science and our team  spirit. Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that has  already led to several innovations, which transforms a little  more, each day, our vision of life. iGEM is a unique opportunity  for us to learn and to excel.
Physics students
Ouriel Caën
Master 1, Theoretical Physics, Paris Diderot University
As a Physics student my curiosity and enthusiasm towards life  sciences has been the driving force to undertake a research  internship in an Israeli laboratory of modern theoretical  Biophysics. There, I learned that Biology is an inexhaustible source of  functions and systems which identification, recombination and  adaption will help to better understand life, and open a new era  of original and fruitful technologies. Synthetic Biology and iGEM  are the best way to implement this teaching. The numerous  testimonies of former iGEM participants evoking an invaluable  personal gain as much on social, organizational and  psychological dimensions, convinced me of my interest to join  the Paris iGEM team.
Hovannes Agopyan
Master 1, Physics for Biology, Paris Descartes University
An opportunity to work with future researchers in a daring  project? A way to get matches in scientifically viable? The  opportunity to be the strong link in a chain? To assume our  capabilities and know how to cooperate? Take pleasure by  advancing? That are the questions that I would like to meet and  answer through my participation in iGEM! I want to test my  own limits in a group that strives for excellence through powerful  synergies. iGEM is probably the missing link that connects  youth and dynamism to the particular world of research. Finally,  I see in iGEM the opportunity to serve Human being, regardless  of the adopted draft.
Computer sciences student
Adrien Basso-Blandin
Master 2, Computer Science, Evry University
My internship's subject deals with Synthetic biology and I would  like to do my thesis on the same subject. Thus, participating to  iGEM allow some practice in synthetic biology. It is also the  opportunity to share knowledge with members of other scientific  communities (biologist, physicist, engineer). Being computer-  scientist, I see iGEM like the creation of RISC processor, an  opportunity to search similitudes between different older projects  in order to model these. Hopefully, this research will simplify  next years work by proposing better computer-science tools for  project development.
Chemistry
Cyrille Pauthenier
Master 1, Chemistry, ENS Ulm
I'm a student in chemistry master at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. Aware that most of the common chemicals we use in our everyday life derived from oil and because I also enjoy studying biology, I started to focus my interest on living materials as an alternative source of carbon for chemistry, and natural chemical transformation processes. This is how I first stepped in Biocatalysis. Then, I discovered the iGEM contest, and get very fan of the idea of engineering life for our own human interest. I'm a very motivated guy, loving to work in team, and on such interesting projects. My aim is to go on in Synthetic Biology after the contest, and probably make a PhD in metabolic pathway engineering.
Pharmacy and Medical students
Babak Nichabouri
2nd year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University
I am currently following the Pharma.D Phd Program. I have to  do a summer internship in the lab of my choice. I chose the CRI  for the multi disciplinary aspect and particularly innovative side.  It is important for me to not shut myself away into one particular  domain, as interesting as it is, and to be always open minded.  iGEM is not only a simple lab internship, it is a pedagogic  program, with no equal, and we will learn as well about people  we work with as ourselves. But iGEM is also a competition, a  great team challenge that motivates us to do great things and do  better still.
Danyel Lee
3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University
I learned about iGEM from a classmate that also wants to  participate in the project. A unique project planned and carried  out by a interdisciplinary group of students, both creative and  innovative, iGEM was clearly not an opportunity that i could  pass by. I look forward to learning from the other members,  learning through the experience, and contributing my own  knowledge and assets to the team.
Kevin Yauy
3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University
I wanted to participate to iGEM for a long time and this year I  have finally possibility, motivation and energy to do it! The project  sounds amazing, work with other peoples, discover new things  in biology, do research. Enpowering my mind. I'm very  interested because I think that I can learn different things with  this competition than if I do another classic internship. It will be  a special experience to live and this is the moment maybe  when ideas of mine and the team could change our world.
Engineering students
Baptiste Couly
3rd Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
I am an engineering student in his final year of study at Mines ParisTech. I discovered synthetic biology almost by chance during an introductory course I took because I remembered dimly that I liked biology in high school. I never regretted it. Synthetic biology is for me the opportunity to design complex systems using the strengths of life to create devices that "traditionnal" engineering can not. It is also the perfect time to work with a team with all kinds of backgrounds.
Oleg Mikhajlov
1st Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
I'm a first year student at Ecole des Mines de Paris. Before that I studied at the physics faculty of Saint Petersburg State University, Russia. Now I would like to see how physics works in biology. Synthetic biology seems to be an excellent example of the interdisciplinary science that regroups biology, physics, computer sciences etc. That's why I joined the iGEM team.
The supervision team
Ariel Lindner

His study interestevolve around applying Physical, Chemical and Biological approaches to study variability between clonal individuals. he si an associate professor at the Paris Descartes university faculty of Medicine (2008/9) and serves as the director of studies of the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI).
Antoine Decrulle
Master 2, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV),
Currently in Master 2 and preparing a thesis, i was in the team  Paris-Liliane Bettencourt during the last edition of the iGEM  competition. For me, it has been a great scientific and human  experience. This year I decided to be part of the new team as  advisor in order to share my experience and to keep learning  from the student and the new project.
Aleksandra Nivina
5th year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University
I discovered the iGEM competition one year ago, and  committed myself to this scientific adventure by joining the 2010  team. Having learned a lot during this intense and exciting  work, I would now like to share my knowledge and experience  with the members of the next team. I'm sure this collaboration  will be interesting and fruitful for both me and the new iGEMers.
Raphaël Pantier
4th year, Pharmacy, Paris 11 University
Last year, I participated to the iGEM competition as a student,  this experience was incredibly exciting and instructive.  However, building a project from its imagination to its design,  modeling and achievement at the bench is not an easy task…  That’s why I would like to share my experience and help the  new iGEM team to go as far as they can!
Thomas Lombès
3rd Year PhD at FdV
Last year’s iGEM competition was for me, as an advisor, a great  human and scientific experience. I am already thrilled by the  brainstorming sessions we have for the 2011 iGEM edition. I will  be glad to share my experience and help the new iGEM team  as much as I can.
Yifan Yang
1st year PhD at Frontiers of Life (FdV)
Naturally, I would be glad to contribute my experience in  previous iGEMs to the current team. Besides the science side,  I'm very interested in teaching science with research, and  untraditional mode of scientific research. iGEM is the perfect  model of both of these. From the teaching side, I'm really  excited by the prospect of getting to know and working with  people from different backgrounds. In addition to that, iGEM is  an opportunity where interdisciplinary projects got done by  undergraduate students, which would never happen in  traditional scientific labs. It's exciting to participate in such  endeavors year after year.
