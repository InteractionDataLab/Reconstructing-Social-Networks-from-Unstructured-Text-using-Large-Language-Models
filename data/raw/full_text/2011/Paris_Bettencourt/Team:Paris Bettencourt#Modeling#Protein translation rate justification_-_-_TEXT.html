Justification for the value of protein translation rate
Protein translation rate (
) is the number of protein that can be produced per second from a strand of mRNA. In our case, because our concentrations are in molecules per cell, we use directly this number in our models. We took the average distance between ribosomes (around 45 nucleotides [1] ) and divided it by its average translation speed on mRNA (15 codon.s-1 [2] ) and we obtained the maximum translation rate of mRNA by ribosomes around 1 protein.s-1. Since our constructs are typically 1kB long and it is commonly admitted the ribosome makes a translation error roughly every 10 000 nucleotides, we assumed there was a 10% error in the translation of our genes.
Our protein translation rate (
) is therefore 0.9 protein.s-1.
