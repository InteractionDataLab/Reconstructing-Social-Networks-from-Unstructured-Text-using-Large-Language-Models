Detailed GFP diffusion experiments
Experiments with Ben-Yehuda's strains
The first GFP diffusion experiments were done with Ben-Yehuda's strains: PY79 (non fluorescent strain) and PY79+S12 (fluorescent strain). These experiments allowed us to train on the slide preparation and do precise adjustments on the microscope. As the intensity of the fluorescence was not high enough in order to allow us to make reliable observations, we did not use these strains for a long time. You can find the details of the experiments on the notebook .
Experiments with wild-type strains
First experiment with wild-type strains
We decided to use a wild-type strain 3610 (non fluorescent strain) and 3610 GFP.  With this strain we obtained better microscopy results (pictures and videos) since the fluorescence was stronger than with the PY79 strain. Hence we decided to continue our GFP diffusion experiments with the 3610 strain. You can find the details of the first experiment with this strain on the notebook .
First successful experiment with wild-type strains
We obtained our first satisfying results with the wild-type strains. Indeed one of the experiments which was done with the 3610 strain allowed us to clearly observe GFP diffusion and thus consitutes one of our main demonstrative experiments. You can find the details of this experiment on the notebook and on the GFP diffusion experiment page .
