Experiments
You can find here all the experiments we did in the lab! The data is organized by design and you will be able to find both the characterization steps and our diffusion experiments.
Preliminaries experiments
Preliminaries experiments : go back and see how we re-did the experiment of the original nanotubes paper.
New devices
We designed entirely these new devices. They are usually composed of an emitter, a receptor and an amplifier sub-unit.
YFP concentrator This design relies on a TetO-array which allow us to concentrate YFP-TetR fusion proteins.
T7 RNA polymerase diffusion In this design, we introduce the use of the T7 polymerase both as the transfer molecule and as the auto-amplification system.
tRNA amber diffusion The tRNA amber is the smallest molecule we are trying to get pass the nanotubes.
Using bistable switches
During our brainstormings, we noticed several natural or artificial bistable switches that could serve both as a receptor and an auto-amplifier. One molecule carefully chosen could toggle the switch in another position. All we have to do is see if it diffuses through the nanotubes.
" ComS diffusion We took advantage of a switch already existing in B.Subtilis (the ComK/ComS switch) and tried to see if we could toggle it from one state to the other using molecules diffusing through the nanotubes.
