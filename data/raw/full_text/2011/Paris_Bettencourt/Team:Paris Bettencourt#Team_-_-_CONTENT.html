and multi-culturalism. Following a bilingual education in France, 
I obtained an Honours Bachelor of Science in Anthroplogy and 
in Biology from the University of Toronto. Drawing from such a 
wide education, I really wish to participate in the iGEM 
competition so that I can bring to the team my biology skills and 
my anthroplogical knowledge. I want to seize the opportunity 
and contribute to this new adventure that synthetic biology is.  </P><UL><LI>Axel Séguret</LI></UL>Master1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University <P>After many talks with some teachers, I had the wish to 
participate in the iGEM competition. The idea of life engineering 
seems to me very interesting. To create standards could 
simplify experiments and all shares. We are not yet researchers 
but we have the ambition to achieve a research project end to 
end. Finally, iGEM contributes to the development of synthetic 
biology, while attempting to demystify the image of science. I 
think science is accessible to people that get caught into the 
game. </P><UL><LI>Camille Huet de Froberville</LI></UL>Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University<P>It's in the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), I discovered and enjoyed really, Synthetic and 
Systems Biology in a multidisciplinary and international 
atmosphere that fitted me well. It's also during my master that I 
heard about iGEM. It's for me, a unique opportunity to work in a 
lab and to be confronted to its management. Moreover it allows 
to completely get involved in a project that is ours from the 
emerging idea to its realisation. Last, iGEM needs us to surpass 
ourselves. That's something that motivates me a lot : pushing 
further our limits to accomplish something that we can be proud 
of. </P><UL><LI>Edward Kwarteng</LI></UL>Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Descartes University<P>iGEM competition is the platform for young researchers to develop 
their talents in such a world competition. Participating in iGEM 
competition will give me the opportunity to think of a scientific 
problem and design how to  solve it autonomously with 
colleagues from different disciplines. It will enhance my 
capabilities to work in a group and share ideas with fellows. 
Synthetic biology is a great tool for future discoveries and i see 
iGEM as the gateway for me to develop interest and equip 
myself in this upcoming field of science.</P><UL><LI>Laura Da Silva</LI></UL>Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University<P>While having a bachelor's degree in Biology of Lyon 1 
University, physics and computer science have always 
interested me. iGEM meaning interdisciplinarity: the mixture of 
all basic sciences, represents, in my mind, a unique opportunity. 
It is an adventure not only from the personal point of view: 
working and setting up a team with students from different 
backgrounds and interacting on different views of Life Sciences 
induced, but also from a professional point of view: to have the 
possibility at our study level to take part in the creation and in 
the development by ourselves of our own scientific project, so 
means a source of intellectual enrichment, at which I am willing 
to take part.</P><UL><LI>Mathias Toulouze</LI></UL>Master 1, Interdisciplinary approaches to Life Sciences (AIV), Paris Diderot University<P>I am very impatient thinking about this competition. According to 
me, it is a special opportunity offered to us. Indeed, in the 
course of this competition we will have to 
leverage our creativity, our passion for science and our team 
spirit. Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline that has 
already led to several innovations, which transforms a little 
more, each day, our vision of life. iGEM is a unique opportunity 
for us to learn and to excel.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Physics_students">Physics students</SPAN></H3><UL><LI>Ouriel Caën</LI></UL>Master 1, Theoretical Physics, Paris Diderot University<P>As a Physics student my curiosity and enthusiasm towards life 
sciences has been the driving force to undertake a research 
internship in an Israeli laboratory of modern theoretical 
Biophysics. There, I learned that Biology is an inexhaustible source of 
functions and systems which identification, recombination and 
adaption will help to better understand life, and open a new era 
of original and fruitful technologies. Synthetic Biology and iGEM 
are the best way to implement this teaching. The numerous 
testimonies of former iGEM participants evoking an invaluable 
personal gain as much on social, organizational and 
psychological dimensions, convinced me of my interest to join 
the Paris iGEM team. </P><UL><LI>Hovannes Agopyan</LI></UL>Master 1, Physics for Biology, Paris Descartes University<P>An opportunity to work with future researchers in a daring 
project? A way to get matches in scientifically viable? The 
opportunity to be the strong link in a chain? To assume our 
capabilities and know how to cooperate? Take pleasure by 
advancing? That are the questions that I would like to meet and 
answer through my participation in iGEM! I want to test my 
own limits in a group that strives for excellence through powerful 
synergies. iGEM is probably the missing link that connects 
youth and dynamism to the particular world of research. Finally, 
I see in iGEM the opportunity to serve Human being, regardless 
of the adopted draft. </P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Computer_sciences_student">Computer sciences student</SPAN></H3><UL><LI>Adrien Basso-Blandin</LI></UL>Master 2, Computer Science, Evry University<P>My internship's subject deals with Synthetic biology and I would 
like to do my thesis on the same subject. Thus, participating to 
iGEM allow some practice in synthetic biology. It is also the 
opportunity to share knowledge with members of other scientific 
communities (biologist, physicist, engineer). Being computer- 
scientist, I see iGEM like the creation of RISC processor, an 
opportunity to search similitudes between different older projects 
in order to model these. Hopefully, this research will simplify 
next years work by proposing better computer-science tools for 
project development.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Chemistry">Chemistry</SPAN></H3><UL><LI>Cyrille Pauthenier</LI></UL> Master 1, Chemistry, ENS Ulm<P>I'm a student in chemistry master at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. Aware that most of the common chemicals we use in our everyday life derived from oil and because I also enjoy studying biology, I started to focus my interest on living materials as an alternative source of carbon for chemistry, and natural chemical transformation processes. This is how I first stepped in Biocatalysis. Then, I discovered the iGEM contest, and get very fan of the idea of engineering life for our own human interest. I'm a very motivated guy, loving to work in team, and on such interesting projects. My aim is to go on in Synthetic Biology after the contest, and probably make a PhD in metabolic pathway engineering.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Pharmacy_and_Medical_students">Pharmacy and Medical students</SPAN></H3><UL><LI>Babak Nichabouri</LI></UL>2nd year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University<P>I am currently following the Pharma.D Phd Program. I have to 
do a summer internship in the lab of my choice. I chose the CRI 
for the multi disciplinary aspect and particularly innovative side. 
It is important for me to not shut myself away into one particular 
domain, as interesting as it is, and to be always open minded. 
iGEM is not only a simple lab internship, it is a pedagogic 
program, with no equal, and we will learn as well about people 
we work with as ourselves. But iGEM is also a competition, a 
great team challenge that motivates us to do great things and do 
better still. </P><UL><LI>Danyel Lee</LI></UL>3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University<P>I learned about iGEM from a classmate that also wants to 
participate in the project. A unique project planned and carried 
out by a interdisciplinary group of students, both creative and 
innovative, iGEM was clearly not an opportunity that i could 
pass by. I look forward to learning from the other members, 
learning through the experience, and contributing my own 
knowledge and assets to the team. </P><UL><LI>Kevin Yauy</LI></UL>3rd year, Medicine, Paris Descartes University<P>I wanted to participate to iGEM for a long time and this year I 
have finally possibility, motivation and energy to do it! The project 
sounds amazing, work with other peoples, discover new things 
in biology, do research. Enpowering my mind. I'm very 
interested because I think that I can learn different things with 
this competition than if I do another classic internship. It will be 
a special experience to live and this is the moment maybe 
when ideas of mine and the team could change our world. </P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Engineering_students">Engineering students</SPAN></H3><UL><LI>Baptiste Couly
</LI></UL>3rd Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
<P>I am an engineering student in his final year of study at Mines ParisTech. I discovered synthetic biology almost by chance during an introductory course I took because I remembered dimly that I liked biology in high school. I never regretted it. Synthetic biology is for me the opportunity to design complex systems using the strengths of life to create devices that &quot;traditionnal&quot; engineering can not. It is also the perfect time to work with a team with all kinds of backgrounds.
</P><UL><LI>Oleg Mikhajlov
</LI></UL>1st Year, Engineer, Ecole des Mines ParisTech
<P>I'm a first year student at Ecole des Mines de Paris. Before that I studied at the physics faculty of Saint Petersburg State University, Russia. Now I would like to see how physics works in biology. Synthetic biology seems to be an excellent example of the interdisciplinary science that regroups biology, physics, computer sciences etc. That's why I joined the iGEM team.

Paris-Liliane Bettencourt during the last edition of the iGEM 
competition. For me, it has been a great scientific and human 
experience. This year I decided to be part of the new team as 
advisor in order to share my experience and to keep learning 
from the student and the new project.</P><UL><LI>Aleksandra Nivina</LI></UL>5th year, Pharmacy, Paris Descartes University<P>I discovered the iGEM competition one year ago, and 
committed myself to this scientific adventure by joining the 2010 
team. Having learned a lot during this intense and exciting 
work, I would now like to share my knowledge and experience 
with the members of the next team. I'm sure this collaboration 
will be interesting and fruitful for both me and the new iGEMers. </P><UL><LI>Raphaël Pantier</LI></UL>4th year, Pharmacy, Paris 11 University<P>Last year, I participated to the iGEM competition as a student, 
this experience was incredibly exciting and instructive. 
However, building a project from its imagination to its design, 
modeling and achievement at the bench is not an easy task… 
That’s why I would like to share my experience and help the 
new iGEM team to go as far as they can! </P><UL><LI>Thomas Lombès</LI></UL>3rd Year PhD at FdV<P>Last year’s iGEM competition was for me, as an advisor, a great 
human and scientific experience. I am already thrilled by the 
brainstorming sessions we have for the 2011 iGEM edition. I will 
be glad to share my experience and help the new iGEM team 
as much as I can. </P><UL><LI>Yifan Yang</LI></UL>1st year PhD at Frontiers of Life (FdV)<P>Naturally, I would be glad to contribute my experience in 
previous iGEMs to the current team. Besides the science side, 
I'm very interested in teaching science with research, and 
untraditional mode of scientific research. iGEM is the perfect 
model of both of these. From the teaching side, I'm really 
excited by the prospect of getting to know and working with 
people from different backgrounds. In addition to that, iGEM is 
an opportunity where interdisciplinary projects got done by 
undergraduate students, which would never happen in 
traditional scientific labs. It's exciting to participate in such 
endeavors year after year.</P><DIV id="footer-wrapper"><DIV id="footer"><UL id="f-list"><LI id="t-recentchanges"><A href="/Special:RecentChanges" title="Recent changes">Recent changes</A></LI><LI id="t-whatlinkshere"><A href="/Special:WhatLinksHere/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Modeling" title="List of all wiki pages that link here [j]" accesskey="j">What links here</A></LI><LI id="t-recentchangeslinked"><A href="/Special:RecentChangesLinked/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Modeling" title="Recent changes in pages linked from this page [k]" accesskey="k">Related changes</A></LI><LI id="t-upload"><A href="/Special:Upload" title="Upload files [u]" accesskey="u">Upload file</A></LI><LI id="t-specialpages"><A href="/Special:SpecialPages" title="List of all special pages [q]" accesskey="q">Special pages</A></LI><LI><A href="/Special:Preferences">My preferences</A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV id="footer"><UL id="f-list"><LI id="t-print"><A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Modeling&amp;printable=yes" title="Printable version of this page [p]" accesskey="p">Printable version</A></LI><LI id="t-permalink"><A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Modeling&amp;oldid=86565" title="Permanent link to this revision of the page">Permanent link</A></LI><LI id="privacy"><A href="/2011.igem.org:Privacy_policy" title="2011.igem.org:Privacy policy">Privacy policy</A></LI><LI id="disclaimer"><A href="/2011.igem.org:General_disclaimer" title="2011.igem.org:General disclaimer">Disclaimers</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
