Abstract
Building on the idea of connexions, may it be between ''subtilis'' or even beween human beings and iGEM teams, we propose two investigations of our own. For both, we went back to the trace of previous teams - their wikis- and scanned them to extract multiple pieces of information. Most notably, we checked for collaborations and for past Human practice projects.
Collaboration map We used TouchGraph to create an interactive map of iGEM collaborations through the years. You can find more about it in this section
Wiki analysis In this section, you will find our synthesis and analysis of previous iGEM wikis and Obama's report on synthetic biology that could lead to the creation of a citizen and scientific proposal on synthetic biology.
