Welcome on the Paris Bettencourt wiki. This is a very basic layout for the time being for as long as we don't properly master the wiki language.
We are fifteen parisian students coming from many different disciplines who came together to participate to the iGEM competition.
You can find out more about our project in the Project section.
We are also dedicated to Safety .
A great thanks to our sponsors:
