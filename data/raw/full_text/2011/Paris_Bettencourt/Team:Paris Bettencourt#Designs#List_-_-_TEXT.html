Design List
Concentrator
In order to observe a celar change in phenotype during diffusion experiments, we worked on a YFP-TetR fusion protein concentrator.
YFP concentrator This design relies on a TetO-array which allow us to concentrate YFP-TetR fusion proteins.
Positive feedback autoloop
We designed entirely these new devices. They are composed of an emitter, a receptor and an amplifier sub-unit.
T7 RNA polymerase diffusion In this design, we introduce the use of the T7 polymerase both as the transfer molecule and as the auto-amplification system.
tRNA amber diffusion The tRNA amber allows the translation of a functionnal T7 RNA polymerase in the receiver cell. This will then trigger the auto-amplification loop.
Using bistable switches
During our brainstormings, we noticed several natural or artificial bistable switches that could serve both as a receptor and an auto-amplifier. One molecule carefully chosen could toggle the switch in another position. All we have to do is see if it diffuses through the nanotubes.
ComS diffusion We took advantage of a switch already existing in B.Subtilis (the ComK/ComS switch) and tried to see if we could toggle it from one state to the other using molecules diffusing through the nanotubes.
Sin Operon We took advantage of a switch already existing in B.Subtilis (the Sin operon switch, regulating sporulation and biofilm formation) and tried to see if we could toggle it from one state to the other using molecules diffusing through the nanotubes.
Lambda switch We took advantage of an artificial switch in E.coli created by the PKU team of 2007 . We tried to see if we could toggle it from one state to the other using molecules diffusing through the nanotubes.
