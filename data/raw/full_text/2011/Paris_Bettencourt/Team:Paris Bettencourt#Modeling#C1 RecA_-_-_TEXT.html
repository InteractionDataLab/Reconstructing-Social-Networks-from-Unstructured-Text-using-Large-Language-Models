Summary
Design
Model
LacI
We use LacI as a repressor for the emitter gene construct. LacI repression can be cancelled by IPTG. This way we can induce production of RFP and T7' by puttig IPTG on the cells.
Inactivated LacI can not repress the pLAC promoter  anymore. Note that we consider that the reaction between IPTG and LacI fires without any delay. This assumption is justified by the fact that this reaction is much faster than any other  in our gene network.
Emitter gene construct - comS
The emitter gene construct is modeled by the following equations:
The reporter for the emitter gene construct (RFP) is modeled by the following equations:
Receiver and amplification gene construct - comK
The receiver and amplification gene construct is modeled by the following equations:
The reporter for the receiver and amplification gene construct (GFP) is modeled by the following equations:
Parameters
This design relies on comS as the signaling molecule going through the nanotubes.
The parameters used in this model are:
