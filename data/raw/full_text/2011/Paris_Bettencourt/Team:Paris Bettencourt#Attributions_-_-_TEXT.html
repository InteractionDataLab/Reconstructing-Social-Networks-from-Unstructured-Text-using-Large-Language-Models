Attributions & Contributions
We are hosted by the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire at the laboratory Inserm U1001 under the supervision of Ariel Lindner. We have decided to split the roles in terms of tasks to be performed, thereafter is the list. A single student can be in different categories. He/she would then use his time accordingly.
Experimentator
There are the regular experimentators who spend most of their time on the bench while punctual experimentators are the rest of the team. The latter are the rest of the people  of the team that have/will be trained in all basic synthetic biology experiments in order to give a hand to the main ones if need be.
Modeling
There are no iGEM projects without some kind of modelling. It allows to predict the behavior of the system, allows to maybe foresee some of the problems that might otherwise be incomprehensible in vivo.  They also take in charge the characterization of future biobricks.
Communication
The students within this sub-team have taken charge of creating the wiki, contacting the sponsors as well as trying to provide the tools and the environment for optimal communication within the team. One must always remember that communicating allows for coordination.
Lab management
The students in charge of this are supposed to know all the security precautions and the functioning of the different machines and microscopes. They are the backbone of the team since they also make the media and the solutions necessary to perform the experiments. Last but not least, they make sure supplies never run out.
Side projects
A non mandatory work that two students of the team are working on. They will contribute to the team by adding some interesting new viewpoints.
