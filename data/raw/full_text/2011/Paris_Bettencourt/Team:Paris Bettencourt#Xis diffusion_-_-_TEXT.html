Bonus track
One possible idea for a very small protein (80 aa) diffusion is to make the Xis excisase protein diffuse through the nanotubes. The system can be sum up with the following scheme:
General scheme of the design
The problem of this design is the stoechasticity of the excision process. The process may occurs with a low probability wich will end up with a large discrepency in the excision time obtained, independantly of the diffusion of the molecule through the nanotubes.
