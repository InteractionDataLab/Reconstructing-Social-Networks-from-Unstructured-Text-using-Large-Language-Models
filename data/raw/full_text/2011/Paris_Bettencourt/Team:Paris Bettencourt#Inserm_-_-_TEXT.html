Host Laboratory
Our iGEM team is kindly hosted in the CRI (Inderdisciplinary Research Center) located in the Faculté de médecine Paris Descartes at the center of Paris.
In this pretty old building, in the heart of one of Paris' biggest hospitals, the CRI  hosts interdisciplinary undergraduate , Master (AIV ; devoted also to systems and synthetic biology!) as well as a PhD program (FdV) . This center is run by François Taddei and Ariel Lindner.

For the Laboratory's facilities, we are kindly hosted by the INSERM U1001 located in the same corridor that lends us benches, microscopes and others facilities as well as their expertise and their cheerfulness! Also, we would like to thank Chantal Lotton who is the lab manager for her advices on the bench and who ensures we worked safely, Ming Ni for his advices on microscopy, Aleksandra Nivina, Antoine Decrulle, Raphael Pantier, Yifan Yang and Thomas Lombes, our advisors who made themselves available at any time.
We would also like to thank Laura Ciriani, who leads the Association SCIRE that took good care of our money, as well as Céline Garrigues and Véronique Waquet, the secretary staff of the CRI for their help and advice in the administrative tasks and commercial relations every team has to face.
