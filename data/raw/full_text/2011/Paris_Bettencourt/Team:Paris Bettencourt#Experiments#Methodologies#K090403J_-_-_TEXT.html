Integration plasmid
In parallel to the transformation with the replicative plasmid (pHM3), we tried to use a Bacillus subtilis integration plasmid. For that, we used the construction of the B.subtilis integration vector pSBINT1 built by the 2008 Cambridge iGEM team.
Bacillus subtilis integration vector
At first, we managed to clone each of our parts in the 5' integration sequence for the AmyE locus of B.subtilis (<partinfo>K143001</partinfo>).
After, we want to clone them into the integrative plasmid (<partinfo>K090403</partinfo>).
