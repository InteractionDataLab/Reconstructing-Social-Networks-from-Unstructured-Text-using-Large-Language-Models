Protocols
A list of all protocols developed during the project. We used this page as a reference throughout the competition.
Amplification of DNA
Polymerase Chain Reaction  : A method for amplifying a section of DNA.
Colony PCR  : PCR with cells as a template. Useful for checking the length of an insert in an introduced plasmid.
Analysis of DNA
Gel Electrophoresis  : A method used to separate DNA fragments of different sizes.
Gel Extraction of DNA  :  A technique used to isolate a desired fragment of intact DNA from an agarose gel following agarose gel electrophoresis.
Rescue Precipitation of DNA  : Creating a clean DNA solution after dissolving agarose gel.
Restriction Enzyme Digestion  : A method for creating a restriction map of a plasmid.
Preparation of DNA Constructs
Primer Design  : Some general guidelines on how to design successful primers.
Gibson Assembly  : An extremely powerful technique for joining multiple, arbitrary DNA sequences in one step, compatible with standard assembly.
Transformation of Bacterial Cells
Making Electro-Competent Bacterial Cells  : The methods required to make various cells competent.
Transformation of E.coli  : A simple method of transforming competent E.coli with your DNA of choice.
Tranformation of B.subtilis  : A technique used to introduce foreign DNA into Bacillus cells.
Transformation of E.coli by Electroporation : A technique for rapidly inserting DNA into cells, typically plasmid DNA, providing the cells are made competent in the correct manner.
Bacterial Cultures
E.coli Cell Culture  : A method for growing a cell culture in liquid medium.
Glycerol Stocks : A method of storing E.coli cells preserving their viability.
Extraction of DNA
MiniPrep  : Extracting DNA from bacterial cells.
Extraction of Genomic DNA from Squid  : Two methods to extract genomic DNA from squid tissue.
Extraction of DNA from Filter Paper  : Extraction of DNA from filter paper which is a safe way of shipping DNA.
Microscopy
Confocal Microscopy  : A method to visualise reflectins from squid samples.
Slide Preparation for Confocal Microscopy  : A method of growing a monolayer of bacterial cells on a slide to aid their microscopic viewing.
Trypsinisation  : A method of dispersing cells from tissue, for microscopy.
Protein Purification
Buffer Preparation  : Methods to prepare the various buffers used to purify his-tagged reflectin from inclusion bodies in E. coli.
Inclusion Body Prep  : Isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies of recombinant proteins.
His-Trap Protein Purification  : A method to purify reflectin from E. coli lysate using an affinity column.
Acetone Precipitation of Proteins  : A method to concentrate solutions of protein.
Ethanol Precipitation of Proteins  : A method to concentrate solutions of protein.
Chloroform/Methanol Precipitation of Proteins  : A method to concentrate solutions of protein whilst removing salts and detergents.
Dialysis of Proteins  : A method for removing salts, urea and contaminants by the use of a semi-permeable membrane and a concentration gradient.
Norgen Proteospin Inclusion Body Prep  : A proprietary kit.
Thin Film Preparation
Substrate Preparation :How to prepare a substrate for flow coating and spin coating.
Spin Coating to Make a Thin Film : Our Spin Coating Protocol.
Flow Coating :  How to flow coat a thin film.
Altering Substrate Surface Chemistry :  Various methods to alter the surface chemistry of silicon and PDMS to achieve better wetting and thin film production
Gel Electrophoresis by SDS PAGE
Protein Identification by SDS PAGE : A method used to separate polypeptides of different lengths.
