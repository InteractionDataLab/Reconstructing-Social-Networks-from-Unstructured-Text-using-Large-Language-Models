Team:Cambridge/desc/labwork/protocols
From 2011.igem.org
These pages contain all the protocols we followed during the competition. Some were adapted from existing protocols (which are acknowledged where relevant), others were designed from scratch.
We have arranged our protocols logically rather than chronologically, as this makes a lot more sense (and makes these pages a lot more useful). However, the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Project'>project</a> section is arranged chronologically, and puts these protocols in context.
