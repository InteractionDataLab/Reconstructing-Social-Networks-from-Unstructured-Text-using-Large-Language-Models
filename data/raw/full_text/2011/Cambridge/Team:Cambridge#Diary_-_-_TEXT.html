5th July 2011 - THE iGEM FACTOR
What a good project idea needs (these are just some things to think about while researching, but try and answer as many as possible in your presentation):
PROJECT TITLE:
What is the goal of this project?
Can we do this in 8 weeks (or less ideally)?
Outline 3 stages to achieve the goal:
What is the most difficult aspect of this potential project?
Does the project have one minimum requirement to work (eggs in one basket) or can we do several miniprojects in parallel?
Has anyone done this before and if so who and how far did they take it? (iGEM team? or other researchers?)
Is there a group in Cambridge or elsewhere we can make use of for this project idea?
What resources are available? Are the genetic sequences available?
Can we use the DNA 2.0 sequencing budget ( they will synthesise from scratch, any sequence up to 8-10kb)  - this is a valuable resource very few other teams will have access to and what would we use it for?
What result/picture on the wiki would PROVE this works.
What biobricks are available? is there scope for making new ones?
What awards and or tracks would this project lend itself to?
Is there an awesomely bad pun for this project title?
