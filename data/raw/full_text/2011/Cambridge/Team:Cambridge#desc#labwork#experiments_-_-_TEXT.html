Team:Cambridge/desc/labwork/experiments
From 2011.igem.org
These pages document the experiments we carried out during the project, and serve as a reference for the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Project'>project section</a>.
The experiments pages themselves explain the scientific reasoning and motive behind our actions, but they don't give step-by-step instructions - this is given in the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Protocols'>protocols section</a>.
