Thursday 7th July
The team's body clocks seem to be adjusting to 'University Time', with the beginning of the working day gradually creeping closer to noon.  An introduction to pipetting for the physical types in the morning, with much amusement as the engineers create solutions wrong by over six (!) orders of magnitude.  Their new-found skills are put into practice at once, as the practical side of our mini-projects (GFP fusions in B. Subtilis) begins (after a short informal talk on PCR).
