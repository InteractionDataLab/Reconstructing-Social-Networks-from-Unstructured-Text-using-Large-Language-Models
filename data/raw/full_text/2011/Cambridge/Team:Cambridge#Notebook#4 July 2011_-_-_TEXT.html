4th July 2011
The day is mainly used in a series of lectures on the use of programming languages for biological systems (see GEC), followed by a workshop to put some of the ideas into practice.  Much fun and head-scratching ensue when we model a logic gate, within a bacterium, on a computer (!).  The team are keen to get down to more brainstorming; as a result of our all-round keen-ness, the working day seems to be steadily creeping longer.
