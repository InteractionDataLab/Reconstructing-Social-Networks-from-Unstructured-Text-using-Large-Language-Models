Is there life after iGEM?
We conducted a <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Society/Questionnaire/Results'>brief poll</a> of past iGEMers and <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Society/interviews'>interviewed a few alumni</a> to find out how they feel about synthetic biology now, in order to better reflect upon our own experiences.
