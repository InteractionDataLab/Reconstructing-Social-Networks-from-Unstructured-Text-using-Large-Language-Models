See youtube videos of our thin films here .
A sample of the microscope images taken of multi-layered thin films.
We conducted a number of experiments with the thin films, outlined below.
Contents
1 Reflectin Thin Films I
2 Reflectin Thin Films II
3 Reflectin Thin Films III
4 Colour Intense Films - First Breakthrough
5 Uniform Films and Multilayers
6 Attempts to increase film stability lead to first stable multilayer
7 Spectral Measurements of Thin Films
Reflectin Thin Films I
Description of the basic method
Colourful thin films created with reflectin & HFIP
Thin film colour not uniform
HFIP thin film control did not show structural colour
Reflectin Thin Films II
Method refined in an attempt to reduce impurities
Bovine Serum Album (BVA) control to test whether generic proteinacious thin films produce colour
Did not show structural colour
Reflectin thin films appear to crystalize on drying
Reflectin Thin Films III
Control indicates that Urea may be to blame for thin film crystalization
More controls show that neither GFP nor BSA exhibit structural colour when spun into thin films
Colour Intense Films - First Breakthrough
Less is more - using the same concentration, spinning a small volume leads to better wetting and more colour intense films
Introducing the 'Piranha solution' for surface cleaning
Uniform Films and Multilayers
Quality over quantity - purer reflectin and greater control over spin lead to colour uniformity
Attempts to create multilayers with alternating PDMS and reflectin.
Problems with stability of reflectin due to impurities hinder progress but produce 'protein art'
Attempts to increase film stability lead to first stable multilayer
Dilution and centrifuging of samples and using only the very top layer seem to provide better stability for urea containing reflectin
Dialysed protein seemed to be more stable however suffers from dewetting
Spectral Measurements of Thin Films
Spectral measurements of single, double and triple refectin-PDMS layers and PDMS control with video footage
Film swelling and colour changes induced by breathing due to reflectin layers illustrating the tunability of reflectin
