What is the real impact of iGEM on its participants and on the field of synthetic biology as a whole?
This short questionnaire has been developed by this year's Cambridge iGEM team in order to answer this very question. If you first participated in iGEM as a student team member, then we would really appreciate it if you could take a moment to complete this questionnaire and contribute to our research. If you know anyone else who might be interested in participating, please send them a link here as well.
We can guarantee that all your responses will remain anonymous in our data analysis; Cambridge iGEM will not share any of your personal details (if we possess them) without your express permission. However, if you are interested in being contacted for further information about your personal story, please leave your contact details at the end of the survey.
The survey should only take you about 7-8 minutes to complete. Click here to begin!
