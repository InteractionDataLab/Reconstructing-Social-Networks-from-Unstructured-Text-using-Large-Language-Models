Tuesday 5th July
A general laboratory safety lecture in the morning, with some emphasis on the global safety concerns that come with easier access to recombinatorial techniques.  More admin is to follow with the set-up of our lab; much confusion results as years-worth of accumulated equipment is unpacked, haphazardly inventoried and replaced according to an esoteric categorising system.
More brainstorming in the afternoon - it's good to see that our thoughts and efforts are spontaneously channelling into particular areas of interest; hope that a fantastic idea will materialise and fear that it won't, in equal measure.
