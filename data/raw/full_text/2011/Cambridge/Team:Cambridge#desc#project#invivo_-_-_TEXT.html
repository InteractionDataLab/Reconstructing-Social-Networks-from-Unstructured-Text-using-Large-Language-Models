From 2011.igem.org
While some materials scientists had investigated the properties of reflectin outside the cell by expressing it at high level and then extracting the protein (as we did during our <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Project/In_Vitro'>in vitro</a> work), no one had investigated what reflectin does when expressed at low level in E.Coli.
This page details our investigation into the proteins' in vivo properties.
