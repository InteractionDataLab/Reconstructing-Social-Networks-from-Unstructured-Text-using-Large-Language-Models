Team:Cambridge/desc/project/microscopy
From 2011.igem.org
We were fortunate enough to have access to a <a href=' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confocal_microscope' >confocal microscope</a> during the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Project'>project</a>, this allowed us to try out various imaging techniques on both squid cells and E.Coli.
