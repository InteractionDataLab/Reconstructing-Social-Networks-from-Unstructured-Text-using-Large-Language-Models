Week: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12
Week 6 : 1st of August to 7th of August
Monday
The BBC are looking for an iGEM team to film as part of a documentary.     Thinking it sounds fun, the team start compiling interesting  project-things to send them, including (as requested) a short video  introducing the team.  Being Cambridge, this can of course be no normal video, and all sorts of wacky ideas are mooted - will keep you posted on   what we decide upon.
Primers have also been designed, after the major headache of transcribing gene sequences from an image file (by hand) and locating errors. Our account for ordering them has unfortunately not been set up, so another delay on starting the main body of our wetwork is quite a blow.
Tuesday
The plans for the video are made, and it is indeed to be no normal video   (but then synthetic biologists have quite a history of such things - see  Ginkgo Bioworks' youtube video).
Plans are also being put in place for a kind of altruistic open-source     Gibson assembly kit for iGEM teams in places where altogether less money   is around for such things.  The recent expiration of the mess of patents associated with taq polymerase could well be an aid to our efforts.
Wednesday
With two days before the deadline, filming begins, and consumes all of the day, since we 'corpse' our lines   reliably on every take.
Thursday
The team have been in contact with some friendly guys from the 'Cambridge  Nanophotonics Centre' (a place of high boffinry) and plans are afoot to    use their machines to make iridescent films, pending expression and  purification of reflectin.
Friday
It may not have been previously mentioned that our software side-project (PyGen/GINA - a kind of 'LaTex' for the nucleotide code) is being worked on by just one lone engineer, spending all day quietly hacking away in a corner and rarely talking (moving, in typical fashion for coders, only for coffee). The morning brings a demonstration by him of the current state of the program and to our delight much progress has been made. We show the typical (perhaps infuriating) behaviour of non-technocrats when presented with such a thing and suggest (to us) simple possible additions that would in fact take many weeks and a medium-sized team of programmers to make.
The rest of the day is comparatively uneventful - things plod on.
