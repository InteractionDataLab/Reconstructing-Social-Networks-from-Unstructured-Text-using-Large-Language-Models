1 July 2011
Morning, and the mini project teams design primers for the fusion/expression experiment the traditional way - with pen, paper and thought.
The mini-project teams present their fusion-targets to the group after lunch.  Three interesting targets - fingers crossed they work (and if they don't perhaps a valuable lesson will have been learned about biological lab-work - to paraphrase our supervisor Jim, "biology doesn't work".  This is swiftly followed by a long, but mercifully very interesting lecture on particularly weird behaviours observed in certain bacteria.  It turns out not only to be interesting, but useful too, as a flurry of new ideas are sparked therefrom.
Our post-it table is closely approaching that critical density at which the chaos turns from the creative variety to the obfuscating; some idea-pruning will need to be done next week.
The whole group are looking forward to punting (with lashings of Pimms!) tomorrow.  Hooray!
