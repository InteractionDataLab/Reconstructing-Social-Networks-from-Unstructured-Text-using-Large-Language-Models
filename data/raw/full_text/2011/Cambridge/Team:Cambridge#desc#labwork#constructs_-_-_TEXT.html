Team:Cambridge/desc/labwork/constructs
From 2011.igem.org
This page acts as a quick reference to all the constructs we made during the competition.
The naming scheme 'GA' refers to the fact that we used <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Protocols/Gibson_Assembly'>Gibson Assembly</a> to construct all of our plasmids.
