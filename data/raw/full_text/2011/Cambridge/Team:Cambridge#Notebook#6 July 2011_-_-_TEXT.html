July 6th 2011
The morning begins with a lecture from one of the Jims on DNA-manipulating techniques (see PCR, gel electrophoresis); are given a long list of all the ways such experiments commonly go wrong.  On comparing the list with experimental protocols it seems very much like every step can be expected to fail on a quite regular basis!
More setting-up of the lab follows along with the by-now-traditional brainstorming session.  After lunch comes a great lecture from one of our team members from the 'Royal College of Art' on the work that goes on at the interface of art and biology.
