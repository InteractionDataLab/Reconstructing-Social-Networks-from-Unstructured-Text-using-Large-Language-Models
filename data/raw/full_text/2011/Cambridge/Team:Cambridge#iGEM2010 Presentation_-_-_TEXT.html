iGEM 2010 Talk
A few of the things that were said in the talk on the 28th of June .
1st Week
Brainstorm many ideas
Filter down to ~10 and research more thoroughly
Avoid Idea Ownership
Decide on project by end of 1st week (as in the 1st wk after crash course)
Come up with a rough plan of the summer
Have daily team meeting to keep everyone up to speed with everything
Meet with supervisors once a week
presentation of the weeks' work
have _specific_ questions ready in advance
Lab work
You will need to make competent cells whatever you do. It's cold
Come up with a common numbering system. Document it. Have either a folder or a google docs spreadsheet describing what everything is and where everything is.
Protocol folder (online or in an actual folder) (I'm about to add it to the wiki)
pair up engineers and biologists initially
build stepwise and test as you go along
KISS
keep and eye on the prise
Get feedback on the project from normal people (not just scientists)
