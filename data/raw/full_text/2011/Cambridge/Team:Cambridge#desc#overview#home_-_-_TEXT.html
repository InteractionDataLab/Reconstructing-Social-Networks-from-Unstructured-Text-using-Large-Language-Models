From 2011.igem.org
Welcome to the Cambridge 2011 iGEM team's homepage!
From here, you can find out more about our <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Project'>project</a>, see the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Parts'>parts</a> we submitted, browse the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Experiments'>experiments</a> we performed to characterise them and read up on the <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Team'>team</a>.  The <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Media'>media page</a> contains our most impressive images and videos.
You can also take a look at what we've done to help the wider <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Project/Gibthon'> SynBio community</a>, as well as read our <a href='/Team:Cambridge/Society'>report</a> on what effect iGEM has on its participants.
