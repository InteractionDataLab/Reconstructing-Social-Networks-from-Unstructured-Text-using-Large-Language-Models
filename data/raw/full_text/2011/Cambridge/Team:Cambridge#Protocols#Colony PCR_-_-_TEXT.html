Colony PCR
PCR can be used to amplify DNA directly from cell culture. We used this as a diagnostic tool to check that our constructs were successful. We used the standard PartsRegistry sequencing primers, VF2 and VR , and ran the PCR product on a gel to check the length.
Theory
Exactly the same as normal PCR except that the template consists of whole cells -- a colony picked from a plate or a small volume of liquid culture might be used -- and there is an initial heating step to lyse the cells.
Practice
Proceed as in normal PCR except with this modified reaction composition (for a 50μl reaction) and cycle settings:
Name
50 μl reaction
Final concentration
Water (reverse osmosis)
35.7 μl
10mM dNTPs
1 μl
200 μM each
10× NH4 buffer
5 μl
1×
Forward Primer 10 μM
2.5 μl
0.5 μM
Reverse Primer 10 μM
2.5 μl
0.5 μM
Template cells
1.3 μl liquid culture or a picked colony
Taq 5u/μl
1 μl
0.1 u/μl
Settings of PCR machine:
Step 1 (cell breakage)
95°C
6 min
Step 2 (cycle)
98°C
55°C
72°C
10 s
30 s
180 s
Step 3 (final extension)
72°C
5 min
Safety
It is important to observe correct laboratory procedure and wear appropriate clothing and gloves. PCR occurs at high temperature and this may present a risk, depending on the PCR machine employed. For handling the cell culture, appropriate measures should be in place to deal with biohazardous waste.
