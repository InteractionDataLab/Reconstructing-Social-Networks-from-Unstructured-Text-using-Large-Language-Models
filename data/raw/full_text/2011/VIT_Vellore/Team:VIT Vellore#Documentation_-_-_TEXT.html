Rapid Boiling Lysis method for Plasmid Isolation
Materials required
LB broth bacteria culture medium. The content are 1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 200 mM NaCl, then it sterilize by autoclaving in suitable aliquots.
STET mix which is contain 5% (v/v) Triton X-I 00, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 8% (w/v) sucrose. Store the mix solution at room temperature.
Lysozyme: Dry powder. Store at -20oC.
70% Ethanol.
Isopropanol.
TE solution: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,1 mM EDTA.
A boiling water bath: An opened bottom tube rack is required because the tubes must be placed directly in the water to achieve rapid heating.
Sterile wooden toothpicks.
Method
Set up a culture for each miniprep by inoculating 2-3 mL of L-broth, containing an appropriate antibiotic (e.g., 100 micrograms/mL ampicillin) with a bacterial colony. Grow overnight at 37oC with vigorous shaking.
Where plasmids have a high copy number, the growth time may be reduced to approx 6 h.
Before starting the miniprep, begin boiling the water and make up a fresh solution of 1 mg/mL lysozyme in STET mix.
Fill a 1.5-mL labeled microfuge tube with an aliquot from each culture. Pellet the bacteria by centrifugation for 1 min at 12,000 g. Carefully aspirate off the supernatant using a drawn-out Pasteur pipet.
The short centrifugation time leaves a loose pellet that is easier to resuspend. If the pellet does not readily resuspend, pipet the solution up and down to dislodge it. Do not suck the pellet directly into the pipet tip.
Vortex each pellet for a few seconds to break up the pellet. Add 20 micrliters STET mix to each tube. The pellet should now easily resuspend by vortexing.
Immediately place the tubes in the open-bottom rack, and place in the boiling water for exactly 45 s. Ensure that each tube is at least half submerged.
Centrifuge the tubes at 12,000 g for 10 min. A large, sticky, loose pellet should form.
Remove the pellet from each tube by “fishing” it out with a sterile wooden toothpick. Because the pellet is quite slippery, it is useful to have a paper tissue at the top of the tube to catch the pellet and prevent it from slipping back down into the tube.
Add 200 microliters isopropanol to each tube, and centrifuge at 12,000 g for 5 min.
Aspirate the supernatant, and wash the pellet in 500 microliters 70% ethanol. Centrifuge the tube for 1 min to compact the pellet, and then aspirate the 70% ethanol.
Air dry the pellets for 10 min, and resuspend each one in 100 microliters TE buffer. Vortex and shake for 10 min before use to ensure complete dissolution.
Use 10 microliters (equivalent to 100 ng of plasmid for most vectors) and analyze by gel electrophoresis.
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
- The agarose gel is prepared with BromoPhenol Blue added as tracking dye.
- The lengths of each part are noted down.
- 20ul of the samples and 7ul of an appropriate ladder are loaded and kept for electrophoresis at 100V for 45 mins.
- After running, the gel is taken to the gel doc machine, and the image under UV transillumination is captured.
Restriction Digest
Prepare the reaction mixture at room temperature in the order indicated:
Water, nuclease-free 15 µl
10X FastDigest® buffer  2 µl
DNA 2 µl (up to 1 µg)
