PowerCell
Discovered significant (24bp) hetero-dimer between genomic DNA-targeting primer sections in all anabaena primers.  The annealing temperature of the heterodimer is between 53 and 59 degrees celcius, making hybridization of primer to genomic DNA rather than other primers very difficult.  We think that the E-X biobrick prefix and RBS overlap overhangs may further impede genomic hybridization, making a lack of high-affinity competitor hybridizations very important.  Reexamining primers.
Identified problem: The segment of primer g001 intended to target 400bp upstream of psaC in Anabaena instead forms the reverse complement of the section of primers g002, g003 and g004 targeting 20bp upstream of psaC.  This explains the heterodimer, and the complete lack of genomic amplification.  This has been designed, and will be reordered.
Nutrient Dependency Assay experiment: repeat with sugar concentrations at those reported by Ducat at SB5--best possible was from E. coli engineered to express cscB and treated with 100mM NaCl.  after 160 hours, 6mM sucrose was observed.  If we repeat the experiment with this best-case, E. coli may be observed.
Perhaps sugar gradient?
Inoculated liquid culture of same E. coli as last time; pSB1A10-J133452
Microscopy of first NDA experiment--no cells visible in BG11+glucose+fructose
PCR: Nostoc primer sets (fwd g0005 with rev g0006-g0008)
To vary annealing temperatures: used gradient PCR between 50-58C (see entry in PCR notebook)
PCR: Primers g0015-g0017 have arrived; used g0016 and g0017 to amplify the GFP mut3b from 2011 Registry (BBa_I719015- GFP mut3b generator with T7 promoter)
Rehydrated I719015 from Registry Plate 1/well 15P; used 0.5ul for 4x reactions
Used four-temp gradient PCR (57.5, 55, 53.2, 51.7 C)
Made calcium chloride competent cells (see other lab notebook)
FRETSensor
Made 1 M stock of HEPES (LM20110705 A1)
Made 1 M stock of MOPS (LM20110705 A2)
Made 250 mL TfBI (LM20110705 A3)
Made 100 mL TfBII (LM20110705 A4)
incubated more top10

PowerCell
ran gel of GFPmut3B amplification.  No amplification.  See PCR notebook.
TOP10 competent cells transformed with GFPmut3B.  Unsuccessful, although the same cells successfully transformed other plasmids.
PCR run on Nostoc vegetative promoter with annealing gradient of 40-50?C.  See PCR notebook, troubleshooting below.
Set up and commenced nutrient dependence assay 2 with varying amounts of glucose+fructose and E. coli.  See experimental design folder.
Troubleshooting the PCR
Possible stages of error:
Primer interactions
Faulty master mix
incorrect annealing temperature
incorrect elongation temperature
drastically lower annealing temp to 40C
primers: mismatched lengths is sub-optimal, excessively long flanking portion
run blank reaction (fwd and rev primers, H2O) to examine primer interactions
run control PCR (previously verified primers + known template) to prove reagents work, user protocol is correct
PCR additives? http://bitesizebio.com/articles/pcr-problems-try-an-additive/
Reorganized lab space in 378, were assigned bench space to contain mess
REGOBricks
grew up e. coli for plasmid prep
ran tap water through cementation column (24 hours)
FRETSensor
Made 5mL competent cells
Transformed with D4, GFPmut3b and pbu11
July 7, 2011
PowerCell
Ran gel of temperature graded medium RBS nostoc vegetative promoter, saw no positive control, saw amplification of primers.  Faint bar on one nostoc lane.
Perform gel extraction on the amplified band in Nostoc + mid RBS (at 50C)
check on NDA
Elhai will resend transformation plasmids!  Possibly one with a methyltransferase!
took micrographs
ran positive controls pcr (see pcr notebook)
FRETSensor
Plates with D4 and pbu11 grown (~30 colonies)
Plate with GFPmut3b did not grow, check plasmid...
REGOBricks
Designed primers for cloning out urease cassette from pBU11
Began column cementation - copy down mass, volume, pore volume (approx.), etc.
approx 250 ml of cells (sample taken----needs to be ODed) cycled through at 11ml/hour
Cells allowed to flow through for 16 hours after cells initially met with the column (not just sitting in the tubing)
Samples OD600 with cuvette at 1.542
Urease activity: (measured with 5 mL cells in 30 mL of 1.5 M urea, using conductivity meter in rm 242 for 10 minutes):
cells have a urease activity of 0.40 mM urea hydrolyzed per minute,  specific urease activity (divide urease activity by OD)- 0.259 mM urea hydrolyzed/min/OD
(Whiffen has: on the order of 10mM urea hydrolyzed/min?)
Received new sample of S. pasteurii from Terran from SDSMT, colonies looked like what we had on the plate on black friday, we think that the colonies were actually S. pasteurii
Ran plasmid prep and RNA digest on HB101 cells containing pBU11, unfortunately misplaced undigested plasmids. Ran gel electrophoresis on the digested samples.
