Protocol Code: M2
LB (Lysogeny broth)
(Taken from Wessel Lab at Brown University )
The following protocol makes ~40 plates.
Making the broth
Add 250 mL of dH2O to a graduated cyclindar.
Mix one of the following:
Weigh out 20g of premix LB Agar powder (VWR DF0445-17)
5.0 g tryptone
2.5 g yeast extract
5.0 g NaCl
7.5 g agar (if making agar plates)
Mix powder well to bring into solution
Add dH2O to total volume of 500 mL and transfer to 1 L flask
Put on stirring hot plate and heat to boil for 1 min while stirring.
Transfer to 1 L pyrex jar and label with autoclave tape.
Autoclave at liquid setting for 20 minutes in a basin making sure to loosen top
Let liquid cool to ~55C (you should be able to pick up the jar without a glove)
Pouring plates
Make sure bench top has wiped down with bleach/EtOH.
Remove sterile Petri dishes (VWR 25384-208) from plastic bag (save the bag for storage).
Pour a thin layer (5mm) of LB Agar (~10mL) into each plate being careful to not lift the cover off excessively (you should be able to just open up enough to pour).
Swirl plate in a circular motion to distribute agar on bottom completely.
Let each plate cool until its solid (~20 minutes) then flip so as to avoid condensation on the agar.
Store plates in plastic bags in fridge with: name, date and contents (note any additive).
Special Additives
(To be added to LB Agar right before pouring plates)
Ampicillin (VWR 80055-786) 50 mg dissolved in a small amout of dH2O (concentration 100 ug/mL)
X-gal (VWR IB02260) 50 mg dissolved in a small amouth of DMSO
Stock solutions
Ampicillin 20mg/mL 200mg in 10mL dH2O (store at 4 in 1mL aliquots) use 50uL on each plate
IPTG (VWR EM-5800) 100mM 238 mg IPTG in 10mL dH2O (store at –20 in 1mL aliquots) use 40uL on each plate
X-gal 40 mg/mL 400 mg X-gal in 10mL DMSO (store at –20 in 1mL aliquots foil wrapped tubes) use 40uL on each plate
