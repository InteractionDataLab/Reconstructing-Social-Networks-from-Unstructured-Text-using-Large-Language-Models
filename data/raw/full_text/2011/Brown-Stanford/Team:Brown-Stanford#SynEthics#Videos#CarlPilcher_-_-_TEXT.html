Introduction
Summary

(0:06) How should we address the human practices of synthetic biology?
Mr. McCauley states the importance of communicating biology with the public, the ethical imperative to continue developing synthetic biology, and the need to plan for the future.
(4:17) Humans, synthetic biology, and a changing Earth
On the relationship between humans and the environment, Mr. McCauley notes that we live in an ecosystem, and that there are adverse phenomena that we must take responsibility for. We cannot simply say that we will modify life to our changed environment; rather, we have a responsibility as conservators on this planet.
(5:50) What do you want to say to synthetic biologists about the future?
Synthetic biology will change the world during this next century in a way never before seen. Mr. McCauley describes the impact of this rapid transformation in the whole timescale of life and urges us to do good.
