Preparation of Samples for Balloon Flight:
Materials:
12x glass cuvettes
Nitrocellulose paper
scissors
Culture of S. pasteurii- grown up overnight
Giant plastic petri dishes
Ruler (accurate to mm, the better quality, the easier to would make preparing and inserting nitrocellulose into the *cuvettes)
Ethanol
a little petri dish holding water
tweezers
Plates
Nitrocellulose
Cuvettes
Preparation Procedure- takes 2 days:
Day 1:
Inoculate culture of S. pasteurii in 50 mL Bang, let it grow overnight
using a piece of paper for preliminary size testing- find out what size the cuvette can hold
Sterilize all cuvettes with ethanol, let stand in UV hood
Day 2:
Gather all necessary materials in Room 378, sterilize scissors in UV hood
cut nitrocellulose into strips with dimensions previously measured before
bring into the hood: pipettes, petri dish with sterile water, bacteria culture,
Lay the cut out nitrocellulose on giant petri dish
add 100 mL of sterile water to each nitrocellulose, then add 50 mL of cells from culture
label what the individual piece of paper are
Let the pieces of paper dry in the 37 C incubator (in giant petri dish, with lid cover)
using tweezers,insert each piece of paper into the cuvette, mark them correspondingly
cover the tops of the cuvettes with parafilm
Loading
Using a cardboard foam cutout, secure four samples in each of the following locations on the balloon
Inside the balloon carriage container, protected from impact, radiation, temperature. Not shielded against pressure.
On the top of  balloon carriage container, exposed to impact, radiation, temperature, pressure.
The other four will be left on the ground, as controls.
Recovery
unload all cuvettes from the balloon.
under sterile conditions, use a tweezer to deposit one cut-out flap of each nitrocellulose sample onto a Bang media dish
incubate at 37 C for 24 hours
examine growth
Suggested: Calibration of Recovery Ability
Before preparing launched samples on a balloon, one should test weather or not the dried sample will be able to be resuscitated. To do this, follow the above preparation procedures,  but instead of loading the balloon, just plate it back on Bang plates, and observe growth.
