</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mars_BioTools:_Synthetic_Biology_for_Space_Exploration"><B>Mars BioTools: Synthetic Biology for Space Exploration</B></SPAN></H1><P>One of the major challenges of space exploration is the limited payload mass that can be launched on a rocket and the difficulty of resupply mid-mission. Any long term settlement will require more resources than astronauts can initially bring with them. Synthetic Biology has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and settlement. Biological tools have a major advantage over classical tools: the ability to self-replicate and regenerate.
</P><P>The emerging field of Synthetic Biology will allow us to engineer microbial factories that will largely circumvent the limiting payload factors. These cellular factories will generate fuel, food, medicines and building materials for settlers, but will consist of engineered cells that could be stored in a single test tube, and regrown to production scale on-site, as needed.
</P><P>The Brown-Stanford iGEM team is excited to work on three different projects, under the common theme of developing Synthetic Biology applications for space. In addition, as a response to the ethical and philosophical considerations, we interviewed prominent researchers and leaders in the field. <B>Click on the astronaut in the corner to view our series.</B></P></DIV><DIV class="miniContent"><DIV class="miniContentLeft"><H3><A href="/Team:Brown-Stanford/REGObricks/Introduction">REGObricks</A></H3><P>Any extra-terrestrial settlement will require a habitat to keep its occupants alive, but transport of such a habitat will require a huge amount of payload space. RegoBricks uses bacteria to cement Martian and Lunar regolith (soil) simulant into durable building blocks, similar to concrete bricks, allowing settlements to use in situ resources to build structures.

</P></DIV><DIV class="miniContentRight"><H3><A href="/Team:Brown-Stanford/FRETSensor/Introduction">FRETcetera</A></H3><P>Biological interfaces cannot pass information to their users as fast as electronic ones can. FRETcetera develops a novel method of fast-acting biological reporting with changes in cell fluorescence. Bacteria could be used to detect toxic chemicals in the environment, for example, or inform astronauts that their microbial tools are unhealthy.


</P></DIV><DIV class="miniContentCenter"><H3><A href="/Team:Brown-Stanford/PowerCell/Introduction">PowerCell</A></H3><P>All biological tools need energy to run. PowerCell develops a universal energy source. Engineered photosynthetic bacteria generate carbon and nitrogenous nutrients from sunlight and air and secrete them to power biological tools. These tools will transform the raw materials into fuel, building materials, food, drugs, and other products useful to settlers.

Unlike more common cyanobacteria species such as Synechocystis PCC 6803 or Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Anabaena is not naturally competent and does not easily uptake foreign DNA. We performed a triparental conjugation in order to bypass the natural barriers to transformation.
</P><P>To demonstrate that expression of our construct is properly co-localized to vegetative cells, we grew cultures of Anabaena in nitrate-free BG11 media to promote heterocyst formation. We demonstrated the successful control of our pSac promoter over our sugar secretion construct through GFP expression. The sugar secretion construct is only expressed in actively photosynthesizing cells. In the first picture, we observe areas of diminished GFP fluorescence at regular intervals (approximately 1 in 10 cells) along our transformed Anabaena filament (the background fluorescence is likely due to chlorophyll). Since our GFP reporter should only express under the pSac promoter and only in non-heterocyst cells, we would expect the spacing of dark spots to match the spacing of heterocysts identified through alcian blue staining. Alcian blue is a dye that selectively binds to polysaccharide chains on the surface of heterocyst cells. As you can see by comparing the two images, our results appear to match up!
</P><P>Work to characterize the performance of our cscB sucrose secretion construct is underway. We will assay sucrose levels produced by PowerCell. If they are high enough, we will attempt to grow E. coli W. containing arbitrary biobricks from this nutrient source, in an attempt to show PowerCell can power biological tools.
</P><CENTER><DIV style="width: 35%;"><P>Transformed Anabaena showing cell-type specific GFP fluorescence under the control of the pSac promoter. GFP expression is on in vegetative cells, off in heterocysts. Some background fluorescence from chlorophyll is visible.

At the time of this writing, it is currently being sequenced in the lab of Dr. Chris Mason at Weill Cornell Medical College. As soon as the sequence is available, we will supplement the directory listing.
