Biocementation Column
Materials
15 mL falcon tube
20 g of Lunar/Martian regolith per tube
A peristaltic pump
Two feet of rubber tubing, epoxy glue, fabric matting
Heat Lamp
30 mL of S. pasteurii culture (OD600 1.2)
Procedure
The columns were first prewet with 20 mL of sterile Bang media.
The bacteria culture was draw into the feed tube, and allowed to settle in the column overnight
Cementation solution (1.5 M equimolar urea and calcium chloride) was fed into the feed tube, which was then placed into a constant loop with the output tube
The column was heated for 5 days, and allowed to cycle.
