Ligation of bricks:Ana, CscB
Transformed
Digest remaining Ana and CscB (from gel extracted stuff)
GIGANTIC PCR:
Ones that have worked in the past: pSB1C3 (8/10 Phu 40-50C), Ana (8/12 Phu 47C), CscB (8/12- CN primers, 47C Phu), Nos (see 8/8 Taq 45-55C), GFP (see 8/8 Taq 45-55C)
We will do: pSB1C3, Ana, CscB, GFP (45-55C, Phu); 4 temps, 60ul each
Ran GIGANTIC PCR products on gel; each template gets its own small gel (30ul product each lane, so eight lanes total);
CscB starts with 1kb ladder, 55-45;
pSB1C3 starts blank, 1kb ladder, 45-55
Ana starts 100bp ladder, 45-55
GFP starts 100bp, 45-55
Got sequence of Gibson miniprep back - it’s contamination, not our sequence.
transformation:
transformation of 25 into 623 was successful!!!!!
picked 623+25 into liquid chlor+kan liquid LB
started large 623 culture in lb + chlor for making competent
made neo50, neo75, neo100 plates for selection testing
anabaena will be plated on nitrocellulose and straight on the bg11.
623+25, 443 to liquid LB culture in preparation for transformation tomorrow.
REGOBricks
Gel extraction of construct from successful and first PCR
Extremely low yield at 1.7 ng/μL. Will try increasing washes and time spent using the gel extraction protocol.
Second PCR, this time taking 4 lanes instead of the single lane we took in the first. Changes to protocol: instead of running the first QG suspension through the filter once, it was run 3 times through; Elutions with EB to bring the DNA back out to solution were performed slowly and repeatedly, as the buffer was allowed to settle for 5 minutes and then pushed through three times.
Yields in two vials (needed to split the protocol up since the amount of gel harvested was greater than a single filter would allow) were 3.9 and 4.3 ng/μL, representing a small increase in yield.
Plasmid Prep of pUB110: using modified qiagen protocol w/ lysozyme www.qiagen.com/literature/render.aspx?id=467
Protocol calls for prep at OD 0.8-1.2, but this culture of B. subtilis was grown over the weekend, OD ~ 1.5
Growth > 16 hrs - bad, because cells begin to lyse.
Anyways, will attempt plasmid prep
Results of Plasmid Prep: Two tubes of highly concentrated DNA, stored in biocementation gel running things box
Tube 1: 360 ng/ul pUB110
Tube 2: 330 ng/ul pUB110

ligation and transformation of Ana and CscB = failed, again.  sadface.
second transformation with Ana and CscB ligation product
another 12μl of each
ran with +control (GFP from registry)
used 1μl (conc ~1200 ng/ml!)
just realized it’s hella early in the day to transform, but stuck them in the incubator early anyway because there’s really no threat of satellite colonies judging from our success rate...
Transformation of BBa_J45200 (banananananas) and BBa_K325909 (LuxBrick, pBAD control only requires induction by arabinose)
Did GIGANTIC GEL EXTRACTION MEGA PCR. Was successful; we have UNCOMFORTABLY LARGE amounts of linear biobricks in the 4C
Digestions: EP digested Ana (33n/u), CscB (20n/u), and pSB1C3 (25n/u)
25ul rxn: with 0.5ul of each RE and 22.25ul of DNA
1hr incubation at 37C, heatkill enzyme at 80C for 20min
Ligations (on just Ana and CscB):
tried 1:1, 3:1, 7:1 insert/vector ratios in parallel, 10ul rxn, 0.5ul of T4 ligase
used 50ng of vector, added various amounts of digested Ana and CscB as necessary
had to make the 7:1 CscB rxn at 18ul due to concentrations
let reaction sit at room temp for 30min before transforming 3ul into 100ul of TOP10
plated 400ul of cells
put remaining 7ul into 16C for overnight, will transform again tomorrow morning
transformation:
lei and jovian are in charge of making 623 competent for jesse’s future use
transform anabaena with 443, 623+25.  This should goddamn work.
there was some black stuff in the e. coli pellet...contamination?
same-plate control of anabaena serial dilution
check on neo gradient experiment
started pRL25 for plasmid prepping (several tubes!)
REGOBricks
Transformation of S. pasteurii, a repeat experiment of our first failed transformation since we were unsure of the quality of our Kan-recovery plates.
August 17, 2011
PowerCell
Got one transformant on cscB from two days ago! Small number of transformants on Luxbrick
liquid cultured these in preparation for miniprep
Transformed 3ul of the remaining Ana and CscB ligation reactions (were in 16C overnight, then stored at -20C until late afternoon)
30min on ice, 45sec at 42C, 1hr recovery in rotisserie; plated on LB chlor
retransform positive controls (banana), on AMP plates this time. Did serial dilutions to get an idea of how competent our cells are--1x, 10^-1x, 10^-2x.
Do verification PCR of ligation
VF2, VR
confusing - bands appear to be in the right places, but it’s as if everything got mixed - Ana has both the bands you’d expect to see for Ana and for cscb. Cscb same story.
Cut out bands - could send in for sequencing? Is concentration high enough?
Liquid prep
plasmid prep prl25, prl25 + 623
transformation
transfer conjugation filters to neomycin plates--one on neo50, one on neo100.
created control plates with five orders of dilution on BG11 without antibiotics
REGOBricks
PCR of puB11 with biobrick prefix and suffix w/ gradient 50-50C
used 1.2 uL DMSO as was found most effective in previus PCR trials
Made cryo-stocks of competent cells for protoplast transformation
August 18, 2011
PowerCell
Sent small and large bands from both Anabaena and cscB (of verification PCR imaged on 8/17) to elim for sequencing; sequences arrived 8/19
miniprep of CscB and Lux cultures, also innoculated 10mL cultures
EP digest of banana smell positive control plasmid--yielded two extremely large bands--several kb larger than expected.

PowerCell
Cryostocks of lux and potential CscB biobricks
but still no glowing e coli :(
Elim sequences returned, of the gel extracted bands from verification PCR of possible Ana and cscB ligations (done on 8/17, sent off 8/18). Sequences do not align with any of our expected parts;
this tells us that the VF2 and VR primers did not amplify our desired insert when we PCRed, the correct insert is not ligated into pSB1C3 :(
Quick and dirty from scratch PCR.
re-do PCR of Ana, cscb, backbone
imaged: Ana, backbone turned out clean, cscB showed three bands of amplification?
Did an X S digest on pos control plasmid; against uncut plasmid, showed two smaller bands
FRETSensor
SDS gel, 15uL of each sample
1 - Doc-CFP
2 - Doc-YFP
3 - Coh-Coh
4 - YFP-Doc

PowerCell
Continue the from-scratch/TOPO workflow:
PCR cleanup (no gel extraction)
the qiagen PCR cleanup kit destroys yield; Nanodrop readings: Ana 7.8, CscB 11, pSB1C3 8.0
digestion with EP again
~30ul rxn, buffer 3, 2hr incubation at 37, 20min at 80 to heat inactivate
ligation with backbone
transformation
