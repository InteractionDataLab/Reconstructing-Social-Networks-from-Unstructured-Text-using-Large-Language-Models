PowerCell
Transformation of GFPmut3B into TOP10 went okay,
Made liquid culture in LB + amp (100 μg/ml)
4ml BG11, 1ml from stock culture
Made more working stocks of cyanos
Rehydrated CscB into 20ul TE; transformed TOP10 cells; PCR with Gibson primers (two PCRs: RBS|CscB, CscB|TTSP)
transformed 100ul TOP10 cells with 2ul of hydrated CscB; x2 replicates; 25min on ice, 2min heat shock @ 42C, then add 500ul LB and place in 37C for ~20min
two plates in 37C at 5:30pm
Viewed plates at 9:30am, 100s of colonies; placed in 4C in Rm335
Make antibiotic plates (jov/lei),
Kanamycin 40 ug/mL
ampicillin 100 ug/mL
tetracycline 10 ug/mL
need amp/tet, amp, kan
Design primers for veg promoter + GFP-only constructs
PCR amplfication anabaena vegetative promoter-mid RBS
PCR cleanup on Nostoc promoter--resulted in 25.8ng/ul of dna product, some fifteen μl
micrographs using oil immersion, get condenser-optimized pictures of cyanos
(*synechocystis 6803: need real picture of cells; cyanothece 7822 needs denser sample; anabaena 7120 needs non-airbubble)

PowerCell
work division: Eli, Julius, Evan,  yet to do, done
imaged PCRs from 7/11: two cscB rxns (the RBS-cscB part, and the cscB-TTSP part); Anabaena promoter-mid PCR as well
miniprep’d the GFPmut3b out of transformant TOP10 liquid cultures.  Plasmids kept in tray with norman’s plasmids in 335 4?C.
streaked out Elhai and Norman plasmids
Norman plasmids: 100ug/ml for pRL1383a
cscB liquid culture in preparation for plasmid harvest on 7/13
innoculated 2ml of LB amp, 3x replicates; placed in 37C at 5:15pm
finished cryostock
PCRs: Anabaena promoter+weak/strong RBS; Nostoc weak/strong RBS; GFPmut3b with ends
FRETSensor
Amp and kan plates made
July 12, 2011
PowerCell
Listened to Jay Keasling's speech on applying synbio to growing biological organisms.
FRETSensor
Amp/Tet + spec plates made
July 13, 2011
PowerCell
image PCRs: Anabaena promoter+weak/strong RBS; Nostoc weak/strong RBS; GFPmut3b with ends.  not much showed up, although bands were present in last lanes (identity?)
cut out most visible (Ana Strong) for gel extraction.
plasmid prep cscB liquid cultures from 7/12
picked colony from conjugal transformation plasmid lines and make antibiotic liquid cultures
REGOBrickes
Made new Bang plates, and resolved the issue with pH. Instead of pHing to 6.8, pHed to 8.5, which helped growth considerably.
Possible plasmids for transformation of S. pasteurii (from B subtilis protocols)
pUB110
pHT43
pHT 01
Others, from Keggins et al (uploaded) include
pPL576
pPL10
pPL7065
pPL2
FRETSensor
SOB made, K12 grown up for competency
July 14, 2011
PowerCell
cryostock cargo/helper/conjugative plasmid strain liquid cultures
gel extraction on Ana strong band cut on 7/13 (nanodrop: <5ng/ml)
imaged Ana weak, Nos weak/strong (from 7/12 PCR)
cut out 600bp band of Ana weak 50- (there were two bands, strong @ ~600bp for 50-, very faint around 500bp for all) and ~600bp band for Nos weak (all four temps), gel extraction
plasmid prep of liquid conjugal transformation plasmid cultures (just the ones we will eventually need to modify); stored @4C in Rm 335, “Norman’s plasmids” rack
pRL25: 30.4ng/ul
pRL1383a: 26.4ng/ul
BBpRL: 16.75ng/ul
ran big PCR of cscB with two ends, cscB with wk and str RBS’s needed for gibson
REGOBricks
printed out research articles detailing transformation protocols for subtilis that we hope to adapt for pasteurii:
Digestion to Protoplast, then transformation
soil transformation
CaCl2
features/reasons to use pUB110:
EcoR1 cut sites
50 copies/cell
If we needed to try phage transformation, pUB was a lot more amenable to those protocols than other plamsids.
Other vectors include two from Cambridge (2008):
pBSINT1 - B. subtilis integration vector (5632 bp) - inserted in amylase gene
pBSEP - episomal
FRETSensor
K12 competency protocol done, 45 tubes of cells
July 15, 2011
PowerCell
imaged  PCR of cscB with two ends, cscB with wk and str RBS’s (from 7/14)
visible bands for cscB-TTSP, RBSw cscB and RBSs cscB; cut out bands and ran gel extraction
imaged Ana mid, positive control and negative control for RBSm-cscB (from PCR done on 7/11)
cut out Ana med bands, ran gel extraction; also performed PCR cleanup using Qiagen kit (result 5ng/ul for gel ext, 17.5ng/ul for PCR cleanup) to use for 2nd round PCR
imaged RBS-GFP-TTSP from 7/12, (-) cont for GFP from 7/14;
cut out four bright bands, NOT YET GEL EXTRACTED; also enough quantity to PCR cleanup directly (NOT YET DONE)
PCR: second round Ana weak, strong, med, Nostoc weak
PCR: RBSm|cscB
REGOBricks
Dosier Media
5g soy protein
15g peptone from casein
10 micrograms manganese sulfate
20 g urea
5g NaCl
FRETSensor
Competency of K12 tested, GFPmut3b transformation has lots of colonies, negative control is completely empty
