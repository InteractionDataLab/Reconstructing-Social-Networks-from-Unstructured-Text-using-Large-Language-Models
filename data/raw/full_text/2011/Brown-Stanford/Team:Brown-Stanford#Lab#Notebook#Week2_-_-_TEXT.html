iGEM HQ
June 20, 2011
Made solid, liquid LB
Made kan, amp solid LB plates
made CCMB80 Buffer
PowerCell
Made BG11 Plates
Streaked out Golden strains on BG11 plates (in the 30? incubator)
Created 5mL liquid BG11 cultures of all the Golden strains (in the 30? incubator)
Streaked Norman’s E. coli conjugative plasmid strains on ampicilin to verify plasmid retention
FRETSensor
Found constructs for fused dockerin-proteins, requested
Found constructs from Fierobe’s lab for cohesin-cohesin group (Scaf4), requested
Talked to Dr. Paavola - will have rosettazyme with C. thermocellum cohesin
Regrowing Evan and Ryan’s strain from Endy’s class
June 21, 2011
Designed construct (see construct page)
Designed Co-culture experiment (see experiment design page)
Incubate with shaking (110rpm) at 30?
Max created liquid culture of Norman’s RP1 strain
REGOBricks
Check up:
S. pasteurii cells did not grow in pH 9.0 Ye-Tris-NH4
pURE11 e. coli grew up nice and turgid
Made autoclaved glucose solution
added glucose at 1g/L to S. pasteurii culture that did not grow
transferred new S. pasteurii to Bang media + glucose
transferred new S. pasteurii to Bang media - glucose
Plated pURE11 E. coli (S. pasteurii) on (Amp + LB) and (urea-test) plate
Plated pURE91 E. coli (Bacillus subtilis) on (Amp + LB) and (urea-test) plate
question: how to plate from agar sticks
Made glycerol stocks for pURE11, (1.4 mL in 18% v/v, stored at -80 in room 389)
growing B. subtilis  agar sticks on LB plates
Briefly outlined mutagenesis
Learned Norman’s way of labeling:
First line: What it is
Second line: Initials, yyyy/mm/dd Letter-# (serial number, then file down locations and specs of Letter-#)
PowerCell
Emailed Daniel Ducat of the Silver Lab to acquire cscB S. elongatus strains
Identified heterocyst, vegetative cell specific promoter candidates to be used in construct design
HetR, patB are good heterocyst candidates
psaC is a good vegetative candidate
Identified sequences for above promoters, as well as glf, invA, cscB genes to be used in construct design
Norman’s strains retained their plasmids!
Transferred Norman’s strains into LB amp+ media,
Sterile technique tip- don’t drop pipette tip into media when transferring to liquid culture, end of pipette tip touches gun, is dirty
June 22, 2011
Several equipment demos from mike on how to use the hemocytometer, microscope in the culture lab, spectrophotometer, and fluorescence meter
First cell counting experiment; determined rough parameters for converting between OD(600nm) and cell density.
Counted cells via Rothschild lab protocol hemacytometers
Used spectrophotometer for OD
Plated all strains
Obtained martian simulant
1L SOB stock made
PowerCell
Most of the day was vaporized dealing with the housing crisis.
Identified sequences for other regulatory elements (varying strength RBSes, terminator). Got them from the registry.
Designed weak, medium, and strong cscB sugar exporter constructs for both Anabaena and Nostoc
Oops, shouldn’t have incubated with shaking.  Without shaking until green, then move to shaking at 110rpm.  Took cyano liquid cultures off shaking platform.
Created liquid culture of Silver’s sucrose invertase/glucose export S. elongatus strain in BG11
Created stocks for plasmid prep
June 23, 2011
PowerCell
Made BG11 stocks except Na2CO3 Made 50mg/mL streptomycin stock
Plasmid prepped Norman’s strains using Norman’s plasmid prep protocol:
D1: pUC18@DH5a NW20110620.41
D2: pSB1A3-P1010@DB3.1 NW20110620.A2
D3: pSB1A10-P1010@DB3.1 NW20110620.A3
D4: pSB1A10-J133452@DH10B NW20110620.A4
E1: RP1@HB101 EM20110620.A1-
E2: PSB3k3-P1010@DB3.1 EM20110620.A2
E3: PSB3k5-P1010@DB3.1 EM20110620.A3
E4: PSB3k5m(>-)-P1010 DB3.1 EM20110620.A4-
-During plasmid prep, 1ml of Sol2 (instead of 300ul) added; user spun down samples, removed some of Sol2, before adding Sol3; asterisked samples already had some Sol3 added before spinning and removing (therefore some of the cells may have already lysed, the DNA was poured off)
Finalized construct design (see construct page)
REGOBricks
Impromptu precipitation expt:
added 10ul of liquid culture from fridge, 1M CaCl2/urea onto a microscope slide, coverslip
samples: E coli + pUre91, E coli + HB101, S.p. in Bang media
samples plated at 5pm
OD/cell density:
Collected OD measurements at 10x and 100x dilution with 600 nm
obtained cell counts at 1x, 10x, 100x dilution (1000x+ has no visible cells)
Grew S. pasteurii in 100 mL Bang (out of Bang media)
Began planning directed evolution experiment in earnest
June 24, 2011
PowerCell
Transferred cyanos to 10ml cultures in square flasks created Na2CO3 stock cryostocked norman’s plasmids (see 6/23/11) Silver’s S. elongatus isn’t doing so well Learned about gibson assembly, designed primers for constructs
REGOBricks
Julius’ impromptu precipitation experiment yielded beautiful microscope pictures
**evidence of cell crystals from both e. coli and s. pasteurii
Made glycerol stocks of subtilis samples
Impromptu precipitation expt:
made 500 mL bang media, filter sterialized
made 100 mL 5x bang media, to add to 400 mL 1.5% agar mix to made bang plates
Obtained lunar simulant
New slide protocol started at 2:55 pm.
Add 20µL of cell sample to top of microscope slide (amount added was unstandardized)
Add 10 µL equimolar Urea/ CaCL2 (1M each)
Drop cover slip on top of sample
Seal edges with nail polish
Observe under microscope slide
Incubate at 37˚ for
FRETSensor
71 tubes of 100uL of competent cells made from TOP10, 500 mL SOB used
