Outreach
Our team was fortunate to attend a variety of exciting events this summer. These included the Fifth International Meeting on Synthetic Biology (SB5.0) , a filming session with the BBC , and Maker Faire NYC . We also created a documentary about the ethics of synthetic biology in space exploration. At each opportunity, we spread our enthusiasm about synthetic biology in space with those around us. In bridging the gap between scientists and the general public, we tried to paint an exciting vision of the future where synthetic biology and humanity's expansion to the stars are closely intertwined. Check out our highlights!
