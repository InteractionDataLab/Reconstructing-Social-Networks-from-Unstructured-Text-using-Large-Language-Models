Introduction
Summary
Dr. William Marshall is a research fellow in the Small Spacecraft Office at NASA Ames Research Center, and a Science and Security Fellow at the Space Policy Institute of George Washington University. In particular, his interests are in mission planning, spacecraft testing for a variety of microsatellite missions, and the global security implications of space strategy.
(0:05) Why should humanity expand into space?
Dr. Marshall states that the fundamental motive for space expansion is risk mitigation and survival. He outlines a difference between a threat to civilization and a threat to existence.
(1:23) How sound is the "survival" argument for space exploration?
Dr. Marshall believes that an argument based on species self-preservation is, in a sense, an extension of our tribal instincts. We urges us to explore the purely rational reasons for why humanity should survive and outlines two potential arguments: that life is rare, and that our existence is intrinsically valuable for our ability to grasp and understand the universe.
(3:15) Where in space do you think we should go?
Dr. Marshall argues that the Moon, not Mars, is the most logical destination for space expansion.
(4:44) What is an ethical argument against going to Mars?
Dr. Marshall outlines why the danger of contamination and disrupting a Martian ecosystem would be of cosmic significance.
