September 5, 2011
PowerCell
Very small speckley colonies on the preliminary balloon revival plates. Don’t really look like cyanos, but maybe?
Microscope these!
Transformed Ana-GFP ligation
made 2 plates, 300ul cells to each
Liquid cultured CHK1.1,3 CHK2.1-6, GPFN
September 6, 2011
PowerCell
miniprep of liq cultures from 9/5
ordered sequencing of minipreps (18 total rxns)
Lots of Ana-GFP transformants! About 20 on each plate! Yayyyyy!
inoculated 3 liquid cultures from each (10 mL cultures, in 15 mL falcon tubes), w/ LB+chlor
labeled x.y.z, where x=attempt, y=plate, z=colony
Make BG11 + 5%LB + 1% agar
Microscope balloon test revivals
if good, prep balloon flight cyanos
REGOBrick
Gel extractions: Approx 50 μL of 17.4 ng/μL = approx 850 ng product
Made mini bricks
made quick brick
Immobilized S. pasteurii on nitrocellulose for flight:
Ground control:
2x left open to the air
2x contained in whirl-pak bags
Flight (inside):
2x left open
2x in whirl-pak
Flight (outside):
2x left open
2x in whirl-pak
Made urease plates to test urease activity afterwards, have bang plates on which to grow retrieved specimens.

PowerCell
miniprep AnaGFP biobrick candidates
1.1.1 133ng/μl
1.1.2 101 ng/μl
1.1.3 89 ng/μl
1.2.1 113 ng/μl
1.2.2 98.5 ng/μl
1.2.3 121 ng/μl
sent in for sequencing
check sequence data from 9/6
GFPN good!
all of the cscB candidates are a bust
most ended up being the lux brick
figure out what to do about cscB
PCR cleanup on the digest
because it had both taq PCR and digest crap
digest of Ana biobrick as an alternative source of pSB1C3
also ordered plain pSB1C3 from the registry
used AHK5 because AHK4 was empty
inoculate new cell culture of our primary Ana biobrick source (AHK4) for cryostocking
REGOBrick
Plan for the next couple of weeks in order to brick and submit our urease part:
Restriction (edited Knight lab protocol)
5 μL NEB2 buffer
25 μL DNA (17 ng/μL)
.5 μL of 100x BSA
1 μL of enzyme 1
1 μL enzyme 2 - NOTE for both of the restriction enzymes, you need to be careful about pipetting; the enzymes are stored in glycerol which can stick to the outsides of the pipets. So when pipetting, only touch the tip to the surface of the water.
17.5 μL ddH20
Add water to .6 mL tube
Add restriction buffer (vortex beforehand to ensure mixing)
Add BSA (vortex)
Add DNA (vortex)
Add enzymes
Place in thermal cycler
4-6 hours incubation @ 37 deg
Go directely to cleanup with Wizard SV PCR and Gel cleanup systems
Vector digest - Silver lab
700 ng vector
1 μL of 10x BSA
1 μL of appropriate buffer for the selected restriction enzymes
.2 μL enzyme 1 (20 units/μL)
.2 μL enzyme 2
Distilled H20 to total volume
Incubate at 37? C
Next morning add .1 μL CIP and incubate at 37 1H (?)
Go to cleanup?
Ligation
x μL vector (20ng)
y μL insert (1:1 insert to vector ratio or 3:1 insert to vector ratio? if 1:1, 103.38 ng of insert will be needed. if 3:1, then approx 310 ng will be needed.)
1 μL of quick ligase
Add appropriate amount of water
Add ligation buffer (vortex before pipetting)
Add insert
Add vector
Add 1 μL ligase - vortex ligase and watch for the glycerol sticking
Incubate for 5 min on benchtop
Place on ice until transformation
generally 1 μL of ligation mix is sufficient
Optional: heat inactivate at 65? for 20 in and then go straight to transformation... no need for 20 min
Transformation with k12 cells
September 8, 2011
PowerCell
balloon launch!
REGOBrick
Filming with the BBC crew
September 9, 2011
PowerCell
cryostock Ana biobrick (from colony AHK4)
miniprep more Ana biobrick -> 185 ng/μl
REGOBrick
50 μL PCR to obtain more urease cassette (successful protocol)
We will be getting pSCB1C3 + J04450 in the mail from iGEMHQ
Waiting on sequence data to determine if there are any restriction cut sites in our operon. If so, we need to restrict at NOT those sites or do site directed mutagenesis.
