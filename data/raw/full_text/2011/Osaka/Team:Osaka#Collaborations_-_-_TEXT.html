Collaborations
Participation in iGEM Japan
iGEM Japan is an alliance of Japanese iGEM teams conceived as a platform for enhancing communication and cooperation between teams, as well as collectively promoting iGEM in Japan. We participated in several meetings to discuss the direction, membership and activities of this group. Two of iGEM Japan's major activities this year were the iGEM Japan Meet-up and a comprehensive, nation-wide Human Practices survey. Please look at the result for further information.
Attributions & Acknowledgements
We take pride in the fact that all experimental work - part design, construction and testing - were done by ourselves, without relying on outside help. However, directly or indirectly our project has benefited from help from the following parties:
Professor Muranaka and all the members of Cell Tech Lab at Osaka University for lending us lab space and putting up with our intrusion
Issay Narumi of Ion Beam Mutagenesis Research Group at Japan Atomic Energy Agency for supplying us with D.radiodurans genomic DNA as well as helpful information and invaluable advice concerning the RecA promoter, etc
Professor Hayano of the laboratory of Hayano at the University of Tokyo and ASACUSA at CERN for invaluable advice concerning biodosimetry and dosimeter.
