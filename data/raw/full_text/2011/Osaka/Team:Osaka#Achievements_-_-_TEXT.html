Our Achievements
Using the iGEM 2011 Judging Form as a guide, we summarize our achievements below.
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
We had a great summer, and are looking forward to having fun at the Jamboree!!
Successfully complete and submit the iGEM 2011 Judging form.
Submitted!
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Done!
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Design of the poster is underway; the members are already practicing their presentations.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleaic acid sequence
Description of function
Authorship
Safety notes, if relevant.
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Please go here for a list of parts we designed or constructed.
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
We submitted 4 new basic parts! (see our parts page)
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
We demonstrated that Deinococcus radiodurans PprI ( BBa_K602001 ),PprA ( BBa_K602002 ), PprM ( BBa_K602003 ) and RecA ( BBa_K602004 ) protected transformed E. coli cells from UV-induced lethality to varying extents; see documentation at Registry or the Tests page.
Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
While we did not come up with a new approach, we did conduct a joint Human Practices survey with various other Japanese teams on issues concerning biosafety and bioethics.
In summary, we fulfilled all the requirements to get a Gold Medal. We also
learned a lot about Synthetic Biology,
had valuable hands-on experience with molecular biology lab experiments,
picked up web-authoring skills like HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
tackled and overcame difficulties with project funding,
interacted with teams from around Japan, Asia and the world, and
had a great summer!
