Questionnaire in our survey
We conducted a wide survey targeted at the general public, with respondents ranging from high school students to working citizens, in collaboration with the Kyoto Institute of Technology ( KIT-Kyoto ). The survey had two objectives. The first was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its associated issues such as bioethics and safety. The second was to capture the public perception of radiation in Japan. We surveyed people who came not only from biological backgrounds but also from various other fields of study. We also obtained feedback from visitors to our universities' open campus events. In addition, we made an online version of our questionnaire to survey even more people from various walks of life.
The Questionnaire
1. When shopping, do you buy "not genetically modified food”?
[ Always buy / Tend to buy / Hardly mind / Not mind / I have never seen such an indication ]
2. Have you ever heard the word, "Synthetic biology"?
[ YES / NO ]
3. What do you associate with [ genetic engineering and biotechnology ]? (※Please circle all that apply)
[ Clone / GM crops (foods) / Patent / DNA / Genome / Medicine / Cosmetic / Bioethics / Virus / Artificial Life / Novel Prize / Environment / Biological weapon / iPS cells / ES cells / Biofuel / Biohazard / The Umbrella Corporation / Others( ) ]
4. What do you associate with [ flies ]? (※Please circle all that apply)
[ Dirty / Clean / Harmful / Useful / Cause of the disease / are used in the research of the disease / Flap wings are dissonant / Often see / Others( ) ]
5. Which do you guess [ an incurable disease ]? (※Please circle five that apply)
[ Conjunctivitis / Cold / Otitis media / Leukemia / Pollen allergy / Cavities / Stomatitis / Pneumonia / Osteoporosis / Osteomyelitis / Stroke / Parkinson's disease / Disc hernia / Arteriosclerosis / Dystrophy / Encephalitis / Influenza / Asthma / Pulmonary tuberculosis / Heart failure / Hyperlipidemia / Diabetes / Vitamin deficiency / The lack of blood / Hemophilia / Cancer / Lymphadenitis / Others( ) ]
6. Do you know [ leukemia ]?
[ Yes / Only hear the word / No ]
7. Which do you guess [ leukemia ]? (※Please circle all that apply)

8. Do you register a bone-marrow bank?
[ YES / NO ]
9. What do you associate with [ radiation ]? (※Please circle all that apply)
[ Terrible / Cancer / Nuclear power plant / Useful / Wisdom of science / unnecessary / negative legacy / Little understand ]
10. Please check your knowledge about radiation(※Please check all that apply)
□ You know the effect to human body by radiation concretely.
□ You know the difference of these units, becquerel and sievert.
□ You know the difference between radioactivity, radiation, and radioactivity substance.
□ You know the difference between external exposure and internal exposure.
□ You know the difference of the effect between to adults and to children.
□ You know radioisotope.
□ You know that radioactive materials are used in our daily lives.
□ You know that the discovery of radiation made a great contribution to the progress of science.
11. What was your source of information on radioactive problem? Please circle all that apply)
[ Newspapers / weekly magagines / TV / Internet / Radio / Friends / Specialists ]
12. How do you feel about information on radioactive problem?(※Please circle all that apply)
[ completely credible / rather credible / hardly credible / little understand / not interested in it]
13. Do you know the relationship between radioactive and bacteria? (Radioresistant bacteria , EM Bacteria etc. )
[ YES / NO ]
14. If yes , please write concretely.
[  ]
Results
The results of questionnaire is as follows.(Total respondent:902)
Almost people do not try to avoid buying genetically modified foods but they are  usually unwilling to eat them. This is contradiction.(Q1)
Synthetic biology is acknowledged by few people. We,iGEMers,have to extend the knowledge of synthetic biology.(Q2)
iPS cells are more remarkable than ES cells.This cause may the news of Prof.Yamanaka at Kyoto University.(Q3)
Many people associate "nuclear power plant" with radiation. We think this cause is the  disaster of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.(Q9)
The effect of radiation on human body is recognized and the usage of radioactive materials in daily lives is also acknowledged by a lot of people.This effect is mostly negative but this usage is not always negative. This is a very interested result. (Q10)
There is not much to choose between the influence of newspapers and that of Internet.When thay get information about radioactive problem, they collect it from skeptical standpoint.Thus, people might want more reliable information.(Q11,Q12)
Almost all people do not know relationship between "radiation" and "bacteria.This cause is,we think,a gap between physics and biology.(Q13)
