Attributions
First we’d like to thank our faculty advisors for all the time, knowledge, and support they so generously shared with us.
We’d also like to thank our lab manager, Kay Christopher, for her invaluable support and advice throughout the summer.
We'd like to thank the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Alumni Lacy Fund, and the Office of the Vice President for Research for providing funding for this project.
Collaborations
Our team was in close collaboration with the VCU iGEM team. The VCU team gave us an enormous amount of relevant and helpful advice about our circuit design, which is reflected in our final design. When they were having difficulty with their sequence assembly method, we helped analyze and troubleshoot the situation, suggesting the assembly method that they ultimately used with success.
