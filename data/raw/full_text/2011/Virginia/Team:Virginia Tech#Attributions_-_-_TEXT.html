Attributions and Contributions
Non-undergraduate work:  Dr. Martha Eborall advised us on DNA assembly and cell transformation, and made a few of our constructs.  Dr. Jean Peccoud and Dr. David Ball designed our mathematical model and provided modeling advice, and Laura Adam provided advice on creating attribute grammars and integrating them into GenoCAD (but did not do any of the work).
