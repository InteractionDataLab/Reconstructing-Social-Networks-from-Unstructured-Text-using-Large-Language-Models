Advice and Best Practices for Future iGEM Teams
Original research rarely goes according to plan. Many of your experiments will fail. Prepare for this by splitting your project into phases that can be completed in parallel.
Be very careful when ordering DNA synthesized by a third party. Especially be ware that by default you will be shipped single-stranded DNA, so you must specify "duplex" if you need double-stranded DNA.
Collaborate with other students from different disciplines. Their perspectives will challenge you to think in new ways about the problems at hand.
Take initiative, be willing to take responsibilities, and get active in seeking out and learning new techniques.
Be curious about a field you have not explored before entering the research group.
