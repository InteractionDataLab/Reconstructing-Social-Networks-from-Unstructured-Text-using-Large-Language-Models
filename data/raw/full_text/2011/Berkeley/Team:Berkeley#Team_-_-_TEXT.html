We are Team Berkeley, a cohesive unit of 7 undergraduates and 3 advisers. Earlier this year we planned a complex and risky project, given the short amount of time iGEM made available. We quickly learned each others strengths and weaknesses and developed standard systems of organizational management in order to synchronize our efforts for the many parallel tasks at hand. We created protocols, shared them with one another, and worked together on troubleshooting. Using google docs to keep up with the status of cloning projects, the results of assays, material logistics, or the final steps required to complete a project ensured that through the months of hard work, we fine-tuned our ability to work together. As a team, we have learned firsthand how the synthetic biology community relies on the goal-oriented cooperation of skilled individuals from very different backgrounds and with very different skill sets. Some of us have strong engineering backgrounds while others of us have strong biology backgrounds, but we all share a desire to build synthetic biological systems that solve human problems. We are proud of the project that we have created which we will present at the Jamboree together in October.
Jason Cham is a third year bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. He enjoys watching movies and playing basketball. He's looking forward to the Jamboree and as always, Go Bears!
Xin Xin Lin is a 4th year Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. When not conducting research or attending classes, she enjoys drawing, crafting, and reading up on art and cake blogs.
Miriam McQuade is a third year Molecular and Cell Biology Major. She enjoys eating food and ballet. When she grows up, she believes she will be a doctor and hopefully one who travels. Her main goal in life is to have many children and ultimately be happy.
Jessica is currently a third-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. What she enjoys most about iGEM is being able to work in a team atmosphere.  When Jessica is not in class or sitting in front of a computer, she enjoys swimming, biking, running, and travelling.
He just graduated UC Berkeley with a BioE major.  He plans to attend graduate school in the fall. During his spare time he enjoys playing basketball, feeding squirrels, and making guacamole!
Fourth year Bioengineering major. Enjoys designing his own T-shirts, playing volleyball, spending all day at the beach, and eating cookies. Those close to him claim he has billions of friends, albiet they are all bacteria.
Conor McClune is a 4th year Biochem and Molecular Biology student, minoring in Bioengineering.   He enjoys upbeat music, looming mountains and volleyball, but despises sarcasm. He's currently struggling with an addiction to synthetic biology.
Gabriel studied Spanish and Biology at UCSB, joined the Berkeley/UCSF BioE Ph.D. program in 2008 and Chris Anderson's lab in 2009. Gabriel participated in iGEM because it offered an experience at the intersection of biology, engineering, teaching, leading, and management.
Terry has a master's degree in chemical engineering from MIT and is currently teaching bioengineering at UC Berkeley. He hopes that by doing so, he will be giving students the tools that they will need to repair him when he gets older.
An Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at UC Berkeley and LBNL, and a principle investigator of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, Chris is the man with the vision.
