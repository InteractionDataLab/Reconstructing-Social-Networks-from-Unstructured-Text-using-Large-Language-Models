Earlier this year we planned a complex and risky project, given the short amount of time iGEM made available. We quickly learned each others strengths and weaknesses and developed standard systems of organizational management in order to synchronize our efforts for the many parallel tasks at hand. We created protocols, shared them with one another, and worked together on troubleshooting. Using google docs to keep up with the status of cloning projects, the results of assays, material logistics, or the final steps required to complete a project ensured that through the months of hard work, we fine-tuned our ability to work together. As a team, we have learned firsthand how the synthetic biology community relies on the goal-oriented cooperation of skilled individuals from very different backgrounds and with very different skill sets. Some of us have strong engineering backgrounds while others of us have strong biology backgrounds, but we all share a desire to build synthetic biological systems that solve human problems. We are proud of the project that we have created which we will present at the Jamboree together in October.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV align="justify"><DIV class="col2-2"><P>Jason Cham is a third year bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. He enjoys watching movies and playing basketball. He's looking forward to the Jamboree and as always, Go Bears!</P></DIV><DIV class="col2-2"><P> Xin Xin Lin is a 4th year Bioengineering student at UC Berkeley. When not conducting research or attending classes, she enjoys drawing, crafting, and reading up on art and cake blogs.</P></DIV><DIV class="col2-2"><P>Miriam McQuade is a third year Molecular and Cell Biology Major. She enjoys eating food and ballet. When she grows up, she believes she will be a doctor and hopefully one who travels. Her main goal in life is to have many children and ultimately be happy.</P></DIV><DIV class="col2-2"> Jessica is currently a third-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. What she enjoys most about iGEM is being able to work in a team atmosphere.  When Jessica is not in class or sitting in front of a computer, she enjoys swimming, biking, running, and travelling.  </DIV><DIV class="col2-2"><P> He just graduated UC Berkeley with a BioE major.

Chris Anderson's lab in 2009. Gabriel participated in iGEM
because it offered an experience at the intersection of biology,
engineering, teaching, leading, and management.
