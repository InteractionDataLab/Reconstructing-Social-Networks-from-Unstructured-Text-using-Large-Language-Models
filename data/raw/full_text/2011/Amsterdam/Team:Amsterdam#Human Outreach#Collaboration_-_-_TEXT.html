Collaboration
Worldwide 167 teams participate in this competition. We try to collaborate with them as much as possible. Helping each other will improve the research of all the teams. This collaboration has taken on many different forms: from having social gatherings with the other Dutch teams to sharing Bio bricks with teams.
On this part of the site you find the different collaborations we had with the other teams.
