Making LB Medium
Luria-Bertani Medium (aka L-Broth or LB Medium).  (Bertani says LB really stands for lysogeny broth.) LB is a standard growth medium for a variety of bacteria and conditions.
Ingredients
10 g Bacto-tryptone
5 g yeast extract
10 g NaCl
Note: To make agar plates add 1,5 gram bacto-agar to 1 liter LB medium.
Protocol
Mix dry ingredients and add distilled water up to 1 Liter
Pour into 2 L flask (or greater)
Autoclave (liquid cycle)
250°F, 22psi, 30 minutes

Making SOB Medium
SOB Medium.  Used in growing bacteria for preparing chemically competent cells.
Ingredients
0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
2% (w/v) tryptone
10 mM NaCl
2.5 mM KCl
20 mM MgSO4
Per liter:
5 g yeast extract
20 g tryptone
0.584 g NaCl
0.186 g KCl
2.4 g MgSO4
Note:Adjust to pH 7.5 prior to use.  This requires approximately 25 ml of 1M NaOH per liter.

Making SOC Medium
SOC Medium used during transformations.
Ingredients
SOB
20 mM glucose
Protocol
Follow directions to make 1 liter of SOB medium.
After cooling medium to less than 50°C, add 20 ml filter sterilized 1M glucose solution.
