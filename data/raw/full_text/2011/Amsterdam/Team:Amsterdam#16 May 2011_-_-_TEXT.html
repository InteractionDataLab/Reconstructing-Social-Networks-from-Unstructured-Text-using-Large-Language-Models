16-05-2011 | Meeting 10
Labwork
Next week we will check the lab
Meet the people
We need accounts at UvA and acces to the computers
Funding
McKinsey scholarship
Jantine will apply us for the scholarship
Kickstarter
Good website to get small money sponsoring
An account will be made
Facebook
Everybody should like our site
Press
Make a press release when we start working in the lab
Projects
A selection of the most promising projects has been made
Buruli ulcer: Mycolactone
A professor from Groningen will be contacted
Questions that we have:
Can it diffuse across a membrane in coli?
Can it be used in coli?
What kind of lab (safety) is required?
Is there an inactive form of the molecule?
Can we work with it in Amsterdam?
Is Groningen willing to donate a couple of days worth of labtime for us to do our validation experiments?
How contagious/poisonous is it?
Is mycolactone presented on the cell surface when bacterium is in the environment or only when it has infected a host?
Thermostable bacteria
Expend the growth temperature curve of E.coli
What temperatures are normal for E. coli?
Luring insects
Has to be checked, because the other ideas failed
