Synthesized genes
Ordering problems
Problem: it was divided in each line a different sequence/tube (1, 61, 181 etc.).
Labwork
Different constructs are being transformed to top10 and dh5alpha. A problem with miniprep, just with one construct The construct has been redone More results tomorrow
Wiki
Working on applications page
Extra
Antifreeze proteins, can be added to our project Yale has been contacted on their project for antifreeze proteins
Waiting for reply to send their bricks to us
Primers should be made for the new stuff from igem send last week
Multiple antifreeze proteins will be added to the project These will be also worked with on the lab These genes will also be used to increase the growth at low temperatures (might work on combination)
Modelling
Protein concentration ---- Fluorescence Miller units are these useful for a concentration conversion?
In Cell free chassis: GFP is a mutant but their characterisation of degradation time is strange
Labwork
Worked on constructs:
K206000+E0840 in bb tetra
K206000+E0840 in bb tetra
K206000+I732017 in bb tetra
K206001+I732017 in bb tetra
R0010+I732017+B0014 in bb chlora
