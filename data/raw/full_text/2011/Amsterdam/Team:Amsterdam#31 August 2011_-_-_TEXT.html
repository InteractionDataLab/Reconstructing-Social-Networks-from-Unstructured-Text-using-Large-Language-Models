Transformation check
Only the positive control showed colonies on the plate
The construct making will be redone
Constructs
Construct were made according to assembly protocol of Delft 2010.
Digestion
Digestion of vectors with SpeI and PstI:
R0010_pSB1A2
K206000_pSBA3
R0010_B0034_pSB1A2
Digestion of inserts with XbaI and PstI:
Shednak
CspC
Cpn10
Cpn60
B0034_Cpn10_pSB1A2
B0034_Cpn60_pSB1A2
B0034_CspC_pSB1A2
Purification
The vectors were purified with size selective purification. The inserts were purified on agarose gel.
Ligation
The following constructs were ligated ON at 16 degrees Celcius:
R0010+ B0034 + CspC
R0010+ B0034 + Cpn10
R0010+ B0034 + Cpn60
R0010+ B0034 + Shednak
K206000+ B0034 + CspC
K206000+ B0034 + Cpn10
K206000+ B0034 + Cpn60
K206000+ B0034 + Shednak
Growth curves
Still measuring the growth curves for 4 and 8°C
