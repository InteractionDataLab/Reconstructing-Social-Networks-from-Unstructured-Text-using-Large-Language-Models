Introduction day at faculty VU
Today, the introduction days at the VU started. The first years were shown around the campus and were introduced to several departments and committees. Our iGEM team arranged to be part of this day. This way we got the chance to introduce our project to the first years. After a small presentation on iGEM we played a short game with bacteria. To stimulate their creativity we also asked them to come up with their own bacterium. By turning it into a contest we hoped to get the most creative ideas and we did. The most creative team came up with a bacterium that could produce melting cheese when a scientist is throwing foam rubber bullets at it. The most applicable bacterium was the bacterium that turned beer alcohol free when a minor was drinking it.
