Project
The project of Amsterdam aims at increasing the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. As such, expressing these proteins will enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37°C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7°C, possibly even allowing growth near 0°C.  On this part of our wiki you will find all information about our project.
