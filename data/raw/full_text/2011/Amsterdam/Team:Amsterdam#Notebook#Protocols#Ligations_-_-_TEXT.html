Ligation
After following our digestion protocol a ligation can be performed.
Different ratios of vector:insert are used, to get the best result out of the ligation.
To check for self-closing vectors a vector-only sample will be ligated.
Materials
PCR tubes/PCR plate
vector and insert DNA
dH20
T4 DNA ligase
T4 DNA ligase buffer
Note: All materials should be held on ice during preparation.

1. Incubate ON at 16°C.
2. Incubate for 20 min at 80°C to heat kill.
3. Use 2 µl of ligationmix to transform into chemically competent cells or electro competent cells .
