Growth curves
Still measuring the growth curves for 4 and 8°C.
We also tested if the growth curves were replicatable, and if the start OD has any influence on the algorithm. Therefore we measured again the growth curves off our top 10 cells at 37 and 30°C.
Constructs
Multiple LB+Amp plates showed colonies. A colony PCR was performed with 35 different colonies. The PCR samples were checked on gel, but none showed the right bandsizes.
