Human Outreach
Synthetic Biology is an important scientific discipline, but it is still quite controversial. Most people don’t know what amazing possibilities arise from research in this field. They think synthetic biology is dangerous and only engenders risks. Unfortunately, the many positive applications of Synthetic Biology are often overlooked.
In order to dispose this negative image it is important to share our experiences, discussions and results with others. Not only with other scientists but also with people who have no knowledge of this type of research.
On this page you will find the many different activities we have organized and participated in during the summer in order to achieve some public understanding and improve our collaboration with other teams.
