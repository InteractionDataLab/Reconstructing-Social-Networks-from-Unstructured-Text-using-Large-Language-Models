Growth curves
Measuring growth curves off our wild type (TOP 10), at 37, 30 and 25°C. (Monday 4, 8, 15 and 21°C will be tested)
Also tested if the growth curve was different if the E.coli was stirred with a bean, or shacked in a stove.
Constructs
2 different assembly methods were used: 3a assembly and the protocol from Delft 2010. This was done to make the following constructs:
B0034-Cpn10
B0034-Cpn60
B0034-CspC
R0010-B0034
K26000-B0034
These parts were digested and afterwards a ligation was performed ON at 16 degrees Celcius.
