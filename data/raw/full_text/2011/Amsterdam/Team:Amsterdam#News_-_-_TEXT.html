Wikifreeze
We have finished our website and are now getting ready for an entire week focussing on the presentation, poster and all the other preparations. In a couple of hours all the European wiki's will be frozen, so we will not be able to change anything till the 3th of October. Luckily for us we have confirmed that our icE.coli will survive this wiki freeze. Hopefully we will see you all in Amsterdam next week.

Ethics discussion with Dwars
Today, two of our teammates traveled to Utrecht to be present at a meeting of DWARS , the youth department of the political party Groen Links ('Green Left'). The meeting was held to discuss synthetic biology. We started by giving a small presentation on  synthetic biology, iGEM and the ethical side of our research. After presenting this information, we participated in a stimulating debate. Overall it was a very fruitful evening and we think that both sides came in touch with interesting new perspectives. More information on this discussion can be found here .
