Human Outreach
Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing scientific discipline, but it is still quite a controversial topic. Most people don't know what amazing possibilities arise from research in this field, and how often already they're reaping its benefits. Some think synthetic biology is dangerous and only engenders risks. Unfortunately, the many positive applications of synthetic biology are too often overlooked.
In order to dispose of this negative image, it's important to share our experiences, discussions, results and insights with others; not just with scientists, but also with people lacking knowledge of this field of research.
In this section, you will find information relating to the many different activities we have organised and participated in during the summer in order to achieve some public understanding, and to improve our working and social with other iGEM teams.
