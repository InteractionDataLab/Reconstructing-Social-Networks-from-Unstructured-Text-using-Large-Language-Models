Growth curves
Measuring growth curves off our first construct!! We measure Cpn10 with a lacz promoter in a ampicillin backbone. As control we take Top 10 cells with an ampicillin resistance. Today we measured at 4, 8, 15 and 21°C.
Construct checks
The following constructs, that showed a good result with colony PCR, were miniprepped:
Cpn60 in pSB1C3
K538101 in pSB1C3
K538104 in pSB1C3
Afterwards they were digested and checked on gel. All showed a good result on gel.
Transformation
The ON ligation samples were transformed into a E. coli TOP 10 strain.
