Funding
No letters received Sponsor letters to UvA and VU will be sent. Internship funding might be useful. Labyrinth tv will be contacted by supervisor Douwe Molenaar.
Projects discussion
Methane producing E.coli
Yuri talked with expert Martijn Bekker.  Need to check if the trans-membrane protein is a problem:
Toxicity
Can methane be made from lactose?
Can methane be made from Acetyl-CoA?
Plastic degrading bacteria
It can be useful, but will it produce enough?
Could plastic be grown on food waste?
Opportunistic infections with AIDS
PAMPs are known,those can be used as targets
Different proteins show a good individual result while blasting
Look at Slovenia iGEM 2006
Neglected diseases
We don't use viruses
Parasites will be checked, but full-grown are to difficult
Signal transduction
Robustness
Signals in cells are noisy
Peter Swain is an expert on this
What application?
Chemotaxis
Examples: Influence flagella, Circadian rhythms influencing
Almhof is working on this
It has been used before in iGEM
Good idea: Let a bacteria take a molecule for transport
Size and precision?
Application?
