Constructs
The following parts were miniprepped:
Cpn10
Cpn60
CspC
K538100
K538101
K538104
K538120
K538130
K538200
Shednak
R0010
K206000
Digestion
Constructs making using the 2a assembly method. Digestion of different parts to construct the following assemblies:
R0010+ B0034 + CspC
R0010+ B0034 + Cpn60
R0010+ B0034 + Shednak
K206000+ B0034 + CspC
K206000+ B0034 + Cpn60
K206000+ B0034 + Shednak
These assemblies were ligated ON at 16°C.
Backbone transferring
Digestion of different parts to tranfer to the Chloramphenicol backbone:
All genes
The constructs we've miniprepped today
Gel purification
The different parts were put on gel and purified with the qiaquick gel extraction kit. Afterwards the concentration of the parts were checked on gel. The following parts for the new assembly showed a good result:
K538130
K206000
K538101
K5389120 The following parts for the backbone transferring showed a good result:
Cpn60
K538200
K538101
K538200 Checking
The assembly was checked on gel after digestion with:
PvuI + PvuII
PvuI + HindIII
On gel this gave the right band sizes.
