Labwork
The first tests of the growth rates are finished. There are still some minor flaws in the design, which will be fixed for the next run. This week, Isoude will do a next run.
We are still working on the assemblies, but there are still some obstacles on the way.
Human outreach
Yesterday, Sandra gave a presentation at the VU for the firstyear students. It was a success. They seemed really interested and a couple of students even wanted to join the iGEM team next year.
Next week, Sandra will give a presentation in Utrecht for the youth department of a political party on the ethics of synthetic biology.
