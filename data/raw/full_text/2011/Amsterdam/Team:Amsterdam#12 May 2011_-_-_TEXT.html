Neglected disease
Kala-azar
Protein is unstable if it is secreted
This is difficult to use in E. coli
A heat test can be used, but will not yield any biobricks
Peanut agluttin binds to LPG
This LPG can be found in multiple organisms
This will lead to false positives
Are there antibodies against the promastigotes/amastigotes?
This will be checked
Hookworm
Detectable in human blood
GP63 protein is expressed in multiple diseases
This can't be the target protein
Buruli ulcer
Is mycolactone specific for this disease?
When ARP is present, mycolactone is inactive
Use the receptor that  M. ulcerans binds to and place it onto an E. coli
Can we order mycolactone?
Target the host not the disease!
We will look into this
Attract the parasite with a pheromone
Ethylene producing E.coli
Evolution takes to long for iGEM
It doesn't produce biobricks
Some literature about the topic will be sent to us
