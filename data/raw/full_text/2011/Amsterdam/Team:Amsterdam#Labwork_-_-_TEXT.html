Labwork
In order to finish our project in a successful way we have spend most of our summer working in the lab.  We have tried to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. On this part of the site you will find information on all our hard labour. What have we done? How did we do it? And what are the results of all that work?
