Workplan
A platereader is available
Only meassurments can be done at RT and 37 degrees Celcius
No difference can be seen between promoter and protein folding at cold temperatures
Maybe with qPCR?
We need to look into this, it is expensive, will it work at low temperatures?
Can we use GFP at cold temperatures for promoter characterisation?
Search for other useful proteins like GFP
Synthesized genes are ordered
Labwork
Ensembly of 2 plasmids will be done
First miniprep, then test on gel
Make glycerol stock of the good colonies
Funding
Kickstarter had some delay, but will be online next week
VU/UVA funding is still in progress
Isogen sponsored us a photospectrometer and a PCR, to borrow it for some time
Modelling
How to model the promoter activity
Meassure OD and fluorescence
Human Outreach/PR
EHBU isn't useful for us
We won't be there
We will concentrate on Nemo/Naturalis
Ad valvas, we can have a short story in September
Labwork
Plates with transformants were counted
Multiple colonies were grown ON 37 degrees celsius in liquid culture
