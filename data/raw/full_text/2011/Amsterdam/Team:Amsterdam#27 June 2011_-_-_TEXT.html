27-06-2011 | Meeting 16
Funding
Ad valvas has been contacted
Still no answer from them
Oil companies will be contacted
Bas has been contacted for funding of VU
Pernette has contacted the dean of UvA for funding
Can other labs at UvA support us with consumables?
Subsidy desk of VU will be contacted for help or funding
Labwork
Everything should be planned! The global plan will be made tomorrow
This plan should contain:
A gene will be a biobrick
Gene coupled to a promoter and terminator will be a biobrick
Cpn60/cpn10 will be coupled as a biobrick
As soon as the kit will be here we will do restriction and ligation
Synthesized genes
Companies will be contacted
Genes will be ordered this week
Extra genes
We could use the following genes out of the kit:
CspA promoter, activation on low temperatures
Colouring genes, To check if the promoter and the construct works
Collaboration
Brown-Stanford will be contacted about their bacteria in space project
We will send them a small project description for collaboration
Human outreach
Nemo, Labyrinth TV and Naturalis should be contacted
Nemo discussion Wednesday 29th June
All team members will come except Jorick and Sandra
Domenico (brings camera) and Frederique will also be there
We will be there for info on the topic: synthetic biology
Lab Work
Grown Bba_B0010 and Bba_B0034 again O/N at 37 degrees
