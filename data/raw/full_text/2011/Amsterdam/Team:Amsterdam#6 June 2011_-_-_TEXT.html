Different Applications:
Protein folding can be a problem at higher temperatures
Production of antibiotics in a low temperature to preserve them
Far future: Produce only pathogenic in low temperature than add to human body as vaccine
Low cost/ecological: Growing on the labtable instead of stove
Labwork: order stuff
Patent found on the genes cpn10/60
We will contact the patent office of UvA to check this
Multiple promoters can be used
IPTG and cold shock promoters
This can be used for 2 different genes
Idea: Coloring the genes: Blue when cold, Red when hot
