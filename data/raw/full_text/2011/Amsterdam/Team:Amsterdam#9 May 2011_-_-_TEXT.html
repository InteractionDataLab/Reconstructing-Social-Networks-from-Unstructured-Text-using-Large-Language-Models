NISB sponsored us!
Some companies rejected us (added to the Masterlist)
Projects discussion
Methane producing E.coli
Sequences of the genes were found
3 multi subunit proteins
One protein is membrane bound, this is a problem, because these proteins fold different in different membranes of organisms.
How to check the methane production?
Try to produce ethylene instead of methane
Ethylene producing E.coli
Only one enzyme is needed and a product in TCA cycle
3 2-oxoglutarate ⇒ 2 ethylene + succinate
Plasmid is already available
It can be edited to be more heat resistent
Applications:
Attracting bacteria
Based on pheromones?
Use it in plants
A lot of responses in plants to ethylene
Neglected diseases
Kala-azar
Parasite called Leishmania
Cell necrosis in skin
Present diagnostic is with antibodies
Peanut agglutin is possible binding target
Search for membrane proteins as targets
Hookworm
It secretes a PAMP
Find a receptor that binds the PAMP
Other possible diseases
Chagas disease
What should be checked for each disease
Expense
Diagnose time present
Diagnose time with new bac
How quick is the disease infection/critical point
Incubation time
PAMP
Receptor
Life stage detection and life expectancy
Sample it can be detected in
Opportunistic infections
Leishmania spp.
Toxoplasma spp.
Pneumocystis jiroveci
