Night of the Nerds
To bring the general public into our world of the laboratorium, the iGEM team Amsterdam contributed to the development of a DNA game of the first iGEM spin-off company, Biotecture . The game will be fun to play and at the same time explain the basic principles of DNA engineering techniques. The game will be presented at the biggest nerd event in the Netherlands: Night of the Nerds . This event will take place at October 8th in Science Center NEMO. The game is still under construction, but if you want to know more, find us at the Jamboree.
