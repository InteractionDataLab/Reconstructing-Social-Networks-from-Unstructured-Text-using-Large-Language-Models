dNTPs
primers ( VF2 and VR )
Taq polymerase
Taq buffer
dH2O
PCR tubes
PCR machine

Make the PCR mix and pippete it in a PCR tube.
Pick a colony from a LB-agar plate using a sterile pipette tip.
Pippete up and down in the PCR mix.
Cross the pippete tip on the new LB-agar plate in the box corresponding to the sample number.
Redo this with all the selected colonies.
Run the following PCR program:
Note: Adjust the elongation time according to the expected product size. 1 minute for each Kb.
Incubate the selected colonoies on the LB-agar plate ON at 37°C.
Check the PCR-sample sizes on agarose gel.
