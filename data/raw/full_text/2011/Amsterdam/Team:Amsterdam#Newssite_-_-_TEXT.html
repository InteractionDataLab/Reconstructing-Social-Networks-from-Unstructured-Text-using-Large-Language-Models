Team Amsterdam among favourites
Team Amsterdam has been pointed out as one of the teams to keep your eye on during the competition, says Christian Lund, a medicine student from Denmark. He participated in last year’s iGEM competition, and is now following the different teams.
Lund wrote a previous blog about the teams of Cambridge and Bielefeld, but in his latest blog he wrote solely about the Amsterdam team. He called the project very ambitious and impressive. “The project has the wow-factor; imagine E.Coli growing at freezing temperatures, that’s impressive!” Although the project has already partly been done, the team has a new and exciting approach. Using the results of previous teams and elaborate those results is following the iGEM spirit. “Some guys have created bacteria that can grow at low temperatures; let’s drop the temperature another couple to degrees to freezing!”  The expectations for the Amsterdam team are high and the competition is enormous, but the team is confident about the project and is looking forward to the jamboree.
