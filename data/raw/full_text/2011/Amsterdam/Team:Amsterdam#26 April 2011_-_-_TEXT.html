Project Discussion
Methane/Ethane producing bacteria
It takes 3 steps to produce methane
Multiple subunit proteins are involved
Contact people at Swammerdam Institute, they have experience in this
Plastic degrading bacteria
Multiple bacteria already do this
No biobricks are found yet
The exact pathway isn’t known
Really slow process, can't we accelerate this?
Plastic producing bacteria
Very interesting for medical application
Already been done in multiple bacteria
The printer of Keltech 2010 also has done this
For biobricks there is an opportunity
Water desalination
Theoretically possible
It is already researched or being researched
Solar Cells bacteria
To difficult to do within this short period
Probiotics
We can’t test this in human
Maybe we can change an already known probiotic to one with fatty acid degration
Sound listening bacteria
Pressure produced by music is to low
Opportunistic infections with AIDS
Diagnostic method at present: antibodies and CD4 T-cells
Look whether the infection is present in the body not if the body works against it
Viruses are difficult to recognize
Fungi have unique proteins that can be targeted
Distinguish between the Fungi and TBC is difficult
