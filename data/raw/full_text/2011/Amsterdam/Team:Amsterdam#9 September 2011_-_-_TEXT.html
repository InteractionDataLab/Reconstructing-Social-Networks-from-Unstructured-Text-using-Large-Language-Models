Constructs
An 3 hour ligation was performed at 16°C to make the following constructs:
K538130-Cpn60
K206000-K538101
Backbone transferring
Digestion of different parts to tranfer to the Chloramphenicol backbone:
All genes
The constructs we got thus far
Gel purification
The different parts were put on gel and purified with the qiaquick gel extraction kit. The following parts showed a good result:
Cpn10
K538104
CspC
K538101
Cpn60
Ligation
An 3 hour ligation was performed at 16°C to transfer the following parts (from 08-09) into the Chloramphenicol backbone:
K538101
Cpn60
K538120
Transformation
After 3 hours of ligation all samples were tranformed into an E.coli Top 10 strain.
