Growth curves
Measuring growth curves off our first construct!! We measure Cpn10 with a lacz in a ampicillin backbone. As control we take WT (top 10). Today we measured at 37, 30 and 25°C. (Tomorrow 4, 8 and at Wednesday 15 and 21°C will be tested)
Constructs
Colony PCR
A colony PCR has been performed on 28 different colonies from the transformation. The samples were checked on agarose gel. This showed good results for the following constructs in Chloramphenicol backbone:
Cpn60
K538101
K538104
Cpn10
New Constructs
Constructs making using the 2a assembly method. Digestion of different parts to construct the following assemblies:
R0010+ B0034 + CspC
R0010+ B0034 + Cpn60
R0010+ B0034 + Shednak
K206000+ B0034 + CspC
K206000+ B0034 + Cpn60
K206000+ B0034 + Shednak
Backbone transferring
Digestion of different parts to tranfer to the Chloramphenicol backbone:
All genes
All constructs to thus far
