Data Page
(Figure 1) This simple illustration shows two protein generators we have constructed, namely Cpn10 and CspC. The Cpn10 protein generator encodes for the Cpn10 chaperone protein, which helps refolding the misfolded proteins in the cell.  CspC encodes for CspC chaperones, whose function it is to refold the RNA molecules. This way the RNA’s can be translated by a ribosome.
Data for our favorite new parts
CspC : This chaperone has been confirmed to increase survival rate of E. coli after multiple freeze/thaw cycles when expressing this cold shock protein.
Cpn10 : Experiments carried out on this gene suggests a possible increase in the survival rate of E. coli after multiple freeze/thaw cycles when expressing this chaperone. Further research is needed to validate these results.
Data for existing parts
R0010 : This promoter is always active in Top 10 E. coli, because it lacks the LacI protein. Our findings seem to confirm this when used in combination with CspC.
B0034 : Going by previous experience with this RBS we chose it on the grounds of the positive comments shown on the experience page. Our results show proteins can be expressed at low temperatures with this RBS in front of them. From this we conclude that the RBS is also useful for translation in cold environments.
