Barbecue in Wageningen
Following the example Amsterdam set, team Wageningen organised a barbecue for al the Dutch teams. On the 5th of August we headed to the Wageningen University. Here we met the other teams. The meeting was supposed to be quite informal and consisted for the bigger part of chatting, drinking beer and enjoying the barbecue of course.
Once again it was a really nice way to catch up with the other teams and to talk about the progress of the different projects.
