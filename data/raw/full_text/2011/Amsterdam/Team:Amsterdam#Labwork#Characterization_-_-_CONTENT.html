We characterize this cold resistance in two different ways.

The first characterization method involves measuring freeze/thaw cycle survival rate. We alternatingly expose <I>E. coli</I> (in liquid culture) to freezing and thawing. After each thaw step, part of the culture is plated out, and after ~15 hours at 37°C, colony forming units (CFUs) were counted on the plates. These CFUs represent the number of viable cells present in the culture. Cold resistant cells will have a higher fraction of cells surviving each cycle. The protocol followed for these experiments can be found on <A href="/Team:Amsterdam/Notebook/Protocols/Freeze_thaw" title="Team:Amsterdam/Notebook/Protocols/Freeze thaw">this</A> page.

The second method through which we characterize cold resistance is more relevant to most of our foreseen <A href="/Team:Amsterdam/Project/Applications" title="Team:Amsterdam/Project/Applications">applications</A>. It involves measuring the effect of expressing a CryoBrick on the specific growth rate (μ) of an organism, at temperatures suboptimal for growth. For normal <I>E. coli</I>, μ peaks at 37°C, making any temperature lower than this suboptimal. The rate at which μ declines when temperatures drop below this optimum is an indication of cold resistance, as more cold resistant <I>E. coli</I> will be able to maintain a higher μ at low temperatures.

μ is defined as <I>the increase of biomass per unit of time, per unit of biomass</I>, and as such, it can be estimated from time-series data of a logistically growing population's density. To characterize the effect of CryoBrick expression on growth at suboptimal temperatures, we measure growth curves of <I>E. coli</I> equipped with a (combination of) CryoBrick(s) at different temperatures. The culture's optical density at a wavelength of 600nm (OD600) is used as an indicator of population density, and measuring this at frequent time intervals during culture growth results in the aforementioned curve. The protocol used to obtain this data can be found <A href="/Team:Amsterdam/Notebook/Protocols/Growth_Curve" title="Team:Amsterdam/Notebook/Protocols/Growth Curve">here</A>. Subsequent analysis of the data, including how μ is estimated, is explained on the <A href="/Team:Amsterdam/Labwork/Data_Analysis" title="Team:Amsterdam/Labwork/Data Analysis">data analysis</A> page.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Results">Results</SPAN></H2><P>At the time of this writing, two of the designed CryoBricks have been characterized, with both characterization methods. The first is <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K538000" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K538000</A>, encoding <I>Cpn10</I>. It was expressed in <I>E. coli</I> through part <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K538200" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K538200</A>: a protein generator under control of the Lac operon's promoter, incorporating one of the stronger Community Collection RBSes (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_B0034" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_B0034</A>). The generator was transformed into the Top10 strain, which is <I>LacI</I> deficient. As such, the part should be expressed constitutively, and no IPTG or lactose is needed to activate expression. Note that <I>Cpn10</I> has only ever been reported to be functional when coexpressed with its partner protein <I>Cpn60</I>, so we expected it not to have any influence on cold resistance at all.

The second CryoBrick we've succesfully characterized is <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K538004" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K538004</A>: <I>Polaribacter irgensii</I> 's <I>CspC</I> protein, expressed in our bacteria through <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K538204" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K538204</A>, which only differs from the <I>Cpn10</I> generator in that it contains the <I>CspC</I> coding region instead. This protein has been reported to strongly increase the freeze/thaw cycle survival rate of <I>E. coli</I>,<A href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/qr2q5722j0t78653.pdf" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[1]</A> so we expected to reproduce this observation. We had no particularly strong prior expectations about this enzyme influencing growth rate at suboptimal temperatures, as nothing of the sort has been reported in literature to date.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Freeze.2FThaw_Cycle_Survival">Freeze/Thaw Cycle Survival</SPAN></H3><P>Two separate freeze/thaw cycle survival measurements confirmed the literature statement that expression of <I>CspC</I> will increase <I>E. coli</I> 's chances of surviving freezing and thawing. The first experiment already demonstrated this through three strains - comprising a <I>Cpn10</I> generator, a <I>CspC</I> generator, or an empty vector - measured in triplo for three cycles. Unfortunately, the initial cell count - to which subsequent measurements are normalized in determining the percentage of surviving cells - was only based on a single plate per strain, and the <I>CspC</I> strain's count was ~4 times as high as that of the other two strains.

Still, interesting observations were made during this experiment. Disregarding the inaccurate first measurement, the percentage of colony forming units (CFUs) that survived was calculated between cycles 2 and 3 instead of cycles 0 and 3. As can be seen in figure 1 below, between the three control plates (top row), there was only a single colony left after a third freeze/thaw cycle, which is effectively 0% of the CFUs making it to the second freeze/thaw cycle. The cells expressing <I>CspC</I>, on the contrary, maintained 90% of the CFU count from cycle 2 in cycle 3. A remarkable observation is that <I>Cpn10</I> also, on average, maintained 30% of the CFUs counted in cycle 2. This suggests it retains a degree of functionality in absence of <I>Cpn60</I>.

If the observation that <I>Cpn10</I> influences <I>E. coli</I> 's ability to survive freeze/thaw cycles in absence of <I>Cpn60</I> can be reproduced, this constitutes an interesting discovery. <I>Cpn60</I> has already been reported to function in absence of <I>Cpn10</I>.<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1138217/pdf/biochemj00085-0050.pdf" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</A> However, to the best of our knowledge, the reverse - <I>Cpn10</I> functioning in absence of <I>Cpn60</I> - has never been reported. Based on structural analysis, it has been suggested the <I>Cpn10</I> of <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> can bind substrates in absence of <I>Cpn60</I>,<A href="http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/185/14/4172.pdf" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[3]</A> but demonstrating the <I>Cpn10</I> of <I>Oleispira antarctica</I> can enhance the cold resistance of <I>E. coli</I> in absence of <I>Cpn60</I> would be a steady step towards validating this otherwise unconfirmed suggestion.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:696px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 1.</B> Plates of three different <I>E. coli</I> strains before (first column, diluted 10.000x) and after (second, third and fourth column, undiluted) three freeze/thaw cycles. The top row of plates were loaded with <I>E. coli</I> comprising an empty vector. The bacteria on the plates in the middle row expressed <I>CspC</I>, and those in the bottom row expressed <I>Cpn10</I>. The bacteria comprising <I>CspC</I> were about 4 times as numerous as the other strains from the start, but after 3 freeze/thaw cycles, their survival rate relative to the amount of CFUs before the first cycle was higher as well. On average, an estimated 0.121% of <I>CspC</I> 's initial cell count remained viable, whereas 0.01% of the <I>Cpn10</I> expressing cells survived. Practically none of the cells with an empty vector survived a third freeze/thaw cycle.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
Following our first experiment, it was decided to try to quantitatively characterize the cold resistance granted by <I>CspC</I> expression more accurately. Quadrupple cultures of cells expressing <I>CspC</I>, and the same amount of cultures comprising empty control vectors, were exposed to three freeze/thaw cycles as with the first experiment. This time, initial cell count was determined in quadruplo instead of in singulo. Subsequent CFU counts were normalized to fractions by division through their respective culture's initial cell count, and the calculated cell survival rates are plotted below. (Figure 2)
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:366px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 2.</B> Percentage of surviving cells after 1, 2 and 3 freeze/thaw cycles for <I>E. coli</I> containing a <I>CspC</I> generator (blue) or an empty control vector (black).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
From the figure above, it can be concluded expression of <I>CspC</I> really does improve the freeze/thaw cycle survival rate of <I>E. coli</I>. At the time of this writing, a similar experiment is being carried out with cultures expressing <I>Cpn10</I>, in an attempt to reproduce its unexpected positive result from the first experiment. We hope to present these results at the regional (and global) Jamboree(s)!
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Growth_at_Suboptimal_Temperatures">Growth at Suboptimal Temperatures</SPAN></H3><P>The growth of 4 different strains was measured at 7 different temperatures. A wildtype strain, a strain comprising an empty vector (with an antibiotic resistance, but no CryoBrick coding regions), and strains equipped with either the <I>Cpn10</I> generator (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K538200" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K538200</A>) or the <I>CspC</I> generator (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K538204" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K538204</A>) were cultured at 4, 8, 15, 21, 25, 30 and 37°C. If expression of a CryoBrick influences growth rate at any of these temperatures, we expect the effect to be strongest at the lower temperatures. Conversely, as the plasmids shouldn't hinder cell growth in optimal circumstances, no differences are expected at 37°C. The results of our growth rate characterization experiments are displayed in figure 3, below.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:942px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 3.</B><I>E. coli</I> 's growth rate as a function of temperature, in strains that do or do not express CryoBricks.

Error bars indicate the average plus or minus two standard deviations.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</SPAN></H2><P>Figure 3 shows that, in accordance with our expectations, expression of <I>Cpn10</I> does <B>not</B> significantly influence growth rates at suboptimal temperatures, at least in the concentration at which it's expressed through this construct. No real expectations existed regarding <I>CpsC</I> 's influence on these growth rates, and apparently, expression of this CryoBrick doesn't allow <I>E. coli</I> to maintain higher growth rates at suboptimal temperatures either.

We have, however, confirmed that the <I>CspC</I> CryoBrick is functional, and that it influences the freeze/thaw cycle survival of <I>E. coli</I>, as we expected it to based on literature. (Figure 2) Of particular interest is that preliminary data suggests expression of <I>Cpn10</I> alone <B>can</B> enhance cold resistance. It doesn't appear to be as efficient as <I>CspC</I> when it comes to increasing freeze/thaw survival, but nevertheless; should follow-up experiments fail to contradict this initial finding, it is to the best of our knowledge the first time <I>Cpn10</I> has been demonstrated to significantly affect <I>E. coli</I> in absence of its partner protein, <I>Cpn60</I>.
