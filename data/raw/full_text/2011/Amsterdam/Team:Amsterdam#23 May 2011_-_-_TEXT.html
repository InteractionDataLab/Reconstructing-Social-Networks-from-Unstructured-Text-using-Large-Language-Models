Project discussion
Mycolactone
More info is on our teamlab page
Read this
It binds to WASP inside of the cell
We will contact the lab in Paris about:
pathways
mycolactone usability
mycolatctone availability
Can it be used/produced by E. coli
Can we bind a fluorescent part to WASP
Monocyt mycolactone
We don't have enough expertise to work with these cells
It can't be used in third world countries
This idea will be rejected
Thermostable bacteria
Chaperon combination with temperature measurement
Extend the growth parabolic graph (better growth at low or high temperature)
How much will the range increase?
Insect luring
Lure them into a trap, then kill them
What will we use to kill it?
Glue, pesticides etc.
Tseetsee fly causes sleeping illness
Look into this
Ethylene
Check the article: Aubel Fussenegger 2010; Mammalian synthetic biology – from tools to therapies
They used acetaldehyde
