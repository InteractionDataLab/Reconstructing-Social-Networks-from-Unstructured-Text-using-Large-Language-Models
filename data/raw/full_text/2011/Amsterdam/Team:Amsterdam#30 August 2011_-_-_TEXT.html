30-08-2011 | Meeting 25
Notulen meeting 30 augustus
Present: Paul, Domenico, Freek, Lisette, Isoude, Bas, Sandra Absent: Jorick, Yuri, Pernette
Lab work
Assemblies look promising.
Parts from Yale are shipped and passed customs.
Growth curve experiments: Measurements of wild type are finished. Experiments with the new strains can start anytime.   Minor problem: Not enough material. Domenico will ask if we can borrow equipment from the VU.
Bas made a model. Domenico and Lisette will have a look at it. Also Douwe should check it.
Human outreach
Presentation in Utrecht went really well. Wednesday: Jantine will give a presentation at the VU. And in the afternoon we have a meeting at Nemo, Sandra and Jantine will go.  Thursday: Delft Day. New meeting of the Minds discussion day. Domenico, Jantine and Sandra will go.
Collaboration: Paul is testing the project of Wageningen University. Software program they send works. He is still working on the CFP test.
We like to remember our supervisor to his promise: Domenico has donated his body to our project and we get to shave his hair if we go to Boston.
