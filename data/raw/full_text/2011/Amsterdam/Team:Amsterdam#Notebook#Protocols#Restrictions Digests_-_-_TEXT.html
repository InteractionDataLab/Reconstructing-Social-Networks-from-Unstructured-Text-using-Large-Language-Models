Digestion: Making new constructs
We used this protocol for digesting the biobricks.
Materials
PCR tubes
dH20
Enzymes (EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI)
BSA
Enzyme Buffer (NEBuffer 2)
Note: All materials should be kept on ice during preparation.

1. Incubate the restriction digest at 37°C for 2 hours.
2. Incubate at 80°C for 20 min to inactivate enzymes.
3. Store at -4°C.
Double digest
To check if the enzymes digest the plasmid as expected, the following digestion should be performed:
1. First use only SpeI(vector) and XbaI(insert).
2. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. take 1 μl of each sample.
4. add PstI to all the samples.
5. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6. take 1 μl of each sample.
7. take 1 μl of each undigested sample.
8. fill each of the three samples up to 10 μl including LD and check them on agarose gel.
Digestion: Changing the backbone
We used this protocol to transfer the construct in a new backbone.

1. Incubate the restriction digest at 37°C for 2 hours.
2. Incubate at 80°C for 20 min to heat kill the enzymes.
3. Store at -4°C.
Double digest
To check if the enzymes digest the plasmid as expected, the following digestion should be performed:
1. First use only EcoRI.
2. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
3. take 1 μl of each sample.
4. add PstI to all the samples.
5. Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
6. take 1 μl of each sample.
7. take 1 μl of each undigested sample.
8. fill each of the three samples up to 10 μl including LD and check them on agarose gel.
Purification
Samples are often purified after digestion using a gel extraction kit. Gel extraction protocols and kits from Qiagen and Fermentas were used.
