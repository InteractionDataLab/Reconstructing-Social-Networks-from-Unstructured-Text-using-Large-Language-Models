Ethylene producing E.coli
The project is to short
Are there alternative ways to meassure ethylene?
Use colors to check if ethylene is produced
Ethylene sensing is difficult, because of the receptor.
Evolution doesn't create biobricks
Neglected disease
Kala-azar
Is the protein available?
Whole parasite is a problem
Signal transduction via peanut agglutin can't be done
Check if peanut agglutin binds to other stuff in human body fluids
We need specialists on this subject
Look at Imperial college, they've done a project on parasites
Target was an excreted protein
Hookworm
CCL11 will be cut and luciferase fades when the hookworm is in the sample
Can't we do this the other way around
Metalloproteases cleaves the CCl11, if this isn't available it doesn't promote luciferase production
Can this be done in E.coli
Are CCL11 and metalloproteases available for in the lab?
Buruli ulcer
It is a bacteria
It is checked with FRET
Can the specific receptor be palced in E.coli
The pathogen is known, but no detection method yet
Can mycolactone be detected?
Membrane receptor can be a problem
Maybe use Mycobacteria
