Education
In order to dispose the negative image of synthetic biology we undertook several activities to educate the public. These activities varied from giving small presentations to being an intergrated part of the entire exhibition during the Nerd Night in the science center in Amsterdam.  Here you will find information about everything we have done in this area.
