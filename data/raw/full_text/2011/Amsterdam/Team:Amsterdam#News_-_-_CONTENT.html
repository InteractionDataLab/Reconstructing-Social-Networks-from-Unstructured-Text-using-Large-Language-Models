In a couple of hours all the European wiki's will be frozen, so we will not be able to change anything till the 3th of October. Luckily for us we have confirmed that our <I>icE.coli</I> will survive this wiki freeze. Hopefully we will see you all in Amsterdam next week.

We got media attention by the magizine for biologists: <A href="http://www.bionieuws.nl/">Bionieuws</A>. Every two weeks, new and exciting bionews is published. This time, Bionieuws has an article dedicated to the iGEM competition, iGEM team Amsterdam and the project IcE. coli.

Today two of our teammembers went to the UvA for an interview with Robbert Dijkgraaf. Dijkgraaf is a professor in Mathematical Physics at the University of Amsterdam and president of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. We talked to him about Synthetic Biology: the dangers and the impact on society, but also about what scientists can do to involve the public in the debate.

The meeting was held to discuss synthetic biology. We started by giving a small presentation on  synthetic biology, iGEM and the ethical side of our research. After presenting this information, we participated in a stimulating debate. Overall it was a very fruitful evening and we think that both sides came in touch with interesting new perspectives.
