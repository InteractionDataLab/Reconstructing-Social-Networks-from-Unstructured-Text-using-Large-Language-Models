Meeting with other Dutch teams
Our exchange of ideas with Delft on the 31st of March was very inspiring to us and we thought it would be a good idea to organize another meeting. However, as there are more than 2 teams in the Netherlands, we thought it would be a good idea to bring all the teams together. The idea was that we could all exchange information with each other and it would also be nice to meet the different participating teams.
Amsterdam meeting
To start off with a good example, we invited all the teams to come to the VU on the 13th May.
We started the evening with presentations from the different teams. Each team got the chance to introduce their team members, give a short summary of the project they are working on and to talk about their human outreach plans.  After the presentations we divided all the teams in smaller groups so they could talk about their ideas and problems. This led to a major exchange of information. Once again we got a couple of new ideas worth exploring and we received some contacts for sponsoring requests.
Besides talking about the projects we thought it would be a nice idea to get to know the other teams better in a more casual way. Since we are all students, we went to the bar at the university for some beers, pizza’s and a nice talk with the other team’s members.
All in all this day was a very nice opportunity to meet the other teams and learn about their projects.
Barbecue in Wageningen
Following the example Amsterdam set, team Wageningen organised a barbecue for al the Dutch teams. On the 5th of August we headed to the Wageningen University. Here we met the other teams. The meeting was supposed to be quite informal and consisted for the bigger part of chatting, drinking beer and enjoying the barbecue of course.
Once again it was a really nice way to catch up with the other teams and to talk about the progress of the different projects.
