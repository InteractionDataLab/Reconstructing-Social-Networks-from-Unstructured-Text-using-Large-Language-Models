Linearized Plasmid Backbones
This protocol was developed by Tom Knight, samples of standard Registry plasmid backbones prepared using this method were sent out in the Spring 2011 DNA Distribution kits .
Short single stranded DNA fragments will not ligate to 4 bp overhangs.  By creating a very short overhang on a PCR of a plasmid backbone, the remnant, when cut with EcoRI and PstI is sufficiently short that it will not anneal at ligation temperature, and will therefore not ligate.  This allows us to build high quality construction plasmid backbone without purifying away the cut fragments remaining after PCR.
We are distributing the prepared construction plasmid as purified PCR products, diluted to standard concentration, but prior to cutting with EcoRI and PstI.  Standard assembly will cut this plasmid backbone with EcoRI and PstI at the same time that the two assembled fragments are cut with EcoRI and SpeI and with XbaI and PstI, respectively.
The preparation of this PCR fragment is done with primers having short overhangs past the EcoRI and PstI sites,  followed by PCR cleanup, dilution to standard concentration, and quality control testing.
Note: The Registry shipping plasmid backbone is pSB1C3.  If you are making linearized plasmid backbone in order to send parts to the Registry, you must use pBS1C3.
Primers:
gccgctgcagtccggcaaaaaa,SB-prep-3P-1 atgaattccagaaatcatccttagcg,SB-prep-2Ea
Diluted to 30 pmol/ul
These primers have been tested with pSB1C3, pSB1A3, pSB1K3, and pSB1T3.
Using the Linearized Plasmid Backbones
The Spring 2011 DNA Distribution should come with a set of linearized plasmid backbones: pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3, and pSB1T3. The linearized plasmid backbones (25ng/ul at 50ul) should be stored at 4C or lower. Prior to ligation the plasmid backbones need to be cut with EcoRI and PstI.

Making Linearized Plasmid Backbones
Bulk Production
The following is the protocol that we used to create the linearized plasmid backbones shipped with the Spring 2011 DNA Distribution. The protocol is in 96 well format, but may be scaled down to suit smaller batches.
2011 Plasmid Backbone Production
PCR mix
9.6ml of PCR Supermix High Fidelity
67 ul of primer SB-prep-2Eb
67 ul of primer SB-prep-3P-1
10 ul of template DNA at 10ng/ul (100ng total) (Note: Do not use a sample of linearized plasmid backbones (PCRed) as a template)
Aliquot 100ul per well in 96 well plate
PCR program
95C/2min
95C/30s
55C/30s
68C/3min
Repeat cycle (steps 2 to 4, 37 more times)
68C/10min
PCR cleanup
Purification of 96 well plates was done through Promega Wizard SV 96 PCR Clean-Up kit and a vacuum manifold. The protocol below follows the manual, with a few changes (in bold), however please see manual for setup instructions.
Add equal volume of Binding Solution to PCR product (add 100ul of Binding Solution to 100ul of product)
Mix by pipetting, transfer all 200ul to Binding Plate, let sit for 1 min
Apply vacuum until samples pass through, about 30s to 1 min
Add 200 ul of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to Binding Plate, let sit for 1min, apply vacuum until ethanol passes through, about 20s to 1 min.
Repeat ethanol wash (step 4) twice more for three washes total
Remove Binding Plate from wash manifold, blot on kim wipes, reinstall in wash manifold
Apply vacuum for 4 min to fully dry Binding Plate
Remove Binding Plate from wash manifold, blot on kim wipes, reinstall in collection manifold
Add 50ul of TE buffer, let sit for 1 min, apply vacuum until eluted, about 1 min
Repeat 50ul elution (step 9) for a total elution of 100ul
Measure concentration on nanodrop, adjust to 25 ng/ul with TE
Single Reaction PCR
PCR mix

Discard liquid, spin dry at 17000g for 3 min
Elute into a new tube twice with 50 ul of TE (100 ul total)
Quality Control
We recommend QCing constructed linearized plasmid backbones, to test success of PCR, ligation efficiency, and background.
Run unpurified PCR product (1 ul) on a gel to verify the correct band and concentration and lack of side products.
Test concentration of purified PCR product. Note: Expected yield should be 40ng/ul or higher. Adjust to 25ng/ul with TE.
Run a digest and ligation test with purified PCR product to determine EcoRI and PstI cutting and ligation efficiency.

15 ul NEB Buffer 2
1.5 ul BSA
90 ul dH20
Run Digest
4 ul of plasmid backbone (approximately 100 ng)
10.5 ul of Digest Master Mix
0.5 ul either EcoRI-HF or PstI enzyme (not both!)
Digest 37C/30min; 80C/20 min
Proceed directly to ligation
Ligation

Ligation Test
Add 5 ul of ligation master mix to digested product
Ligate 16C/30min; 80C/20 min
Run all 20 ul on a gel
Compare intensity of the single and double length bands.  More efficient ligations will show stronger double length bands than single.

Plate on the appropriate antibiotic
Observe few colonies.  Any colonies represent background to the three antibiotic assembly process
