Growth curves
Measuring growth curves off our second construct!! We measure CspC with a lacz in a ampicillin backbone. As control we take TOP 10 cells with ampicillin resistance. Today we measured at 37, 30 and 25°C. (On Sunday we will measure 4, 8, 15 and 21°C.)
Miniprep
Miniprep of:
R0010+ B0034 + CspC (renamed to K538204)
R0010+ B0034 + Cpn10 (renamed to K538200)
Construct Check
K538204 has been digested with:
EcorI and PstI
PvuII and KpnI
This showed the expected band sizes, we can use it for the growth experiments.
Sequencing and iGEM shipment
The following constructs were prepared for sequencing and the shipment to iGEM-HQ:
K538101 in pSB1C3
K538104 in pSB1C3
CspC in pSB1C3
Cpn10 in pSB1C3
