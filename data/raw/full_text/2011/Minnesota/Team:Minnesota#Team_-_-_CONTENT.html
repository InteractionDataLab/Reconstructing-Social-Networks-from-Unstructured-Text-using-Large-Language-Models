Throughout a majority of her undergraduate career, Daniele has investigated the molecular mechanisms under which mammalian G-protein gated ion channels act. Focusing on the role G-proteins play in connection with drugs of abuse, Daniele continues to conduct research under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Wickman. Her research experience was further expanded with participation in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). Daniele’s UROP project explored the correlation between protein structure and function of potassium channels in the central nervous system. In addition to research, Daniele participates in a variety ways around campus. She has taught general biology lab for the University of Minnesota. Moreover, she has been an integral part of many campus clubs, including: Major Mentor Program, Orientation and First-Year Programs, University-YMCA, Colleges Against Cancer, Alpha Epsilon Delta, and the American Medical Student Association. Her extracurricular engagement extends into the community, volunteering to assist local businesses and area hospitals. Beyond academic involvement, Daniele dedicates her spare time to music promotion, production, and performance with a Twin Cities based company.
