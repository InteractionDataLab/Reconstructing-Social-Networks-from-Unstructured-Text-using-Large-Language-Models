Purpose:
We started another PCR reaction using Taq polymerase to use TOPO kit. The idea is to place the gene into a vector using the TOPO kit to increase the chances for digestions since the enzymes will be able to grab onto the DNA.
Procedures:
-Same as before except the use of Taq instead of Vent.
Results:
In 40 uL of H20,
PCR OmpA=53.3 ng/uL
