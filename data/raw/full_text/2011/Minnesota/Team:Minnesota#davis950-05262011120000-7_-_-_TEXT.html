PCR reaction set up for pcyA gene from Syneccocystis sp 6803. Two genomic DNA samples were 6 ng/ul and 3 ng/ul. Samples were concentrated to 15.9 ng/ul. Eight PCR reactions were set up using between 1 and 8 ul of template DNA.
Miniprep of overnight pCph8. Four tubes with concentrations between 38.3 and 43.4 ng/ul. Minprep placed in -20 degree C freezer. Image of agarose gel attached.
