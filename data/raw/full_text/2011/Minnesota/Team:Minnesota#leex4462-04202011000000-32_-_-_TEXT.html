Purpose:
Our instructor, Sara, discovered that the overexpression of OmpA is detrimental to the E. coli so we needed to place the ompA in a controlled promoter. The pucBB plasmid contains a consituent promoter. The new pBAD promoter is a arabinose induced promoter.
Procedure:
-Inculated 2 tubes with strains containing the pBad plasmid in LB+Amp (4 mL)
-Stored overnight in the 37 degree shaker.
