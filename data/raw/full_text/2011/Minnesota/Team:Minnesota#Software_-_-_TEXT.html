Introduction
In conjunction with our project, we have developed software tools designed to manage an electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) which is specifically tailored to interact with the iGEM Wiki page. The following tools were designed or adapted for use in our ELN software:
Labnote: Labnote is the main ELN application. Labnote was written from scratch by Nathan Davis.
Rtf2WikiMarkup: This application is a command-line tool designed to convert the RTF entries produced by Labnote into valid Wiki Markup suitable for upload to a MediaWiki-powered site. Rtf2WikiMarkup is an extension of the Rtf Converter framework written by Jani Giannoudis which can be found at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/RtfConverter.aspx?msg=3093850 .
WikiBot: This application is a command-line tool which allows automated uploading of files and pages to a MediaWiki-powered site. This application utilizes a modified version of the DotNetWikiBot framework which can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetwikibot .
Below you can find the source code for these applications as well as a compiled distribution which should run "out of the box" on Windows platforms. NOTE: all files have been scanned for viruses prior to uploading.
Please use a program to verify the checksums listed below before opening any files.
Labnote
Labnote is written in C# and requires that the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 be installed on your computer. Labnote has the following dependencies:
RicherTextBox: Labnote depends upon the RicherTextBox custom user control originally written by Svetoslav Svov and modified by Nathan Davis.
csharp-sqlite: Labnote depends upon the CSharp-SQLite framework.
The Labnote source code can be found here . This source code is distributed under the GPL 3.0 license found within the zip file.
Rtf2WikiMarkup
Rtf2WikiMarkup is a command-line utility written specifically for use with Labnote. Rtf2WikiMarkup is capable of receiving an RTF document and converting it into a plain text Wiki Markup file along with any accompanying images that might be a part of the RTF document. Rtf2WikiMarkup was written by Nathan Davis and is an adaptation of the Rtf Converter framework written by Jani Giannoudis.
The Rtf2WikiMarkup source code can be found here . This source code is distributed under the GPL 3.0 license.
WikiBot
WikiBot is a command-line utility which is capable of uploading image files and page text to a MediaWiki-powered site. WikiBot was written by Nathan Davis and utilizes a modified version of the DotNetWikiBot framework .
WikiBot depends upon a component of the Phyrtech Framework, the source code for which can be found here .
The WikiBot source code can be found here . This source code is distributed under the GPL 3.0 license.
Compiled Distribution
For your convenience, a zip file containing the compiled versions of Labnote, Rtf2WikiMarkup, and WikiBot along with their dependencies is provided here .
