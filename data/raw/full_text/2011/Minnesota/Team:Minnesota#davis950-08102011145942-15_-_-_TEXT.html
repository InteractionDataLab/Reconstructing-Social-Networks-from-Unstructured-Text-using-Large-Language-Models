Transformed electrocompetent cells with ligation products of pucBB-pBad-ho1, pucBB-pBad-pcyA, and pucBB-pTet-Cph8. Added 5 ul of each ligation product to 100 ul compentent cells. ho1 ligation product contained excessive salt and caused arc during electroporation. Attempted a second electroporation with 2.5 ul ho1 ligation product which was successful. Plates placed in 37 degree C incubator in Claudia's lab. David Babson will remove plates first thing in the morning and will place them in cooler. NOTE per David: do NOT pick colonies which turn red on the plate.
