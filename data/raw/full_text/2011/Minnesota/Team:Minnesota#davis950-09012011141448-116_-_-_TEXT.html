ompR and silicatein PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel. One distinct band was observed around 1kb for silicatein. Two distinct bands were observed near 100 bp for the ompR PCR product. Both ompR bands and the silicatein band were cut out and gel purified. Concentration of silicatein product was 176.2 ng/ul. Concentration of ompR (high band) was 11 ng/ul. Concentration of ompR (low band) was 6.2 ng/ul. Products were store in the -20 degree C freezer.
