Lauren Cole
Lauren is a senior at the University of Minnesota and majoring in Genetics and Cell Development and Philosophy. She likes working with people, and intends to go into the medical field. She is currently working in an immunology lab and is excited to expand her experience in genetics with iGEM. In her spare time she loves to sing, cook (and eat), and she also plays her harp for hospice patients. Lately she's been into playing tennis baseball with her weimaraner Henry, who is a great outfielder.
Nathan Davis
Nathan Davis worked on the iGEM competition at the University of Minnesota while working toward completion of his undergraduate degree in Biology. After graduation, Nathan intends to find work in an applicable industry while pursuing opportunities for additional education. Aside from being a student at the University of Minnesota, Nathan is also an Emergency Medical Technician with Osceola Area Ambulance Service in Osceola, Wisconsin. In his spare time, Nathan likes to sail on Lake Pepin or check out a local event.
Jessica Dent
Jessica Dent was involved with the 2011 iGEM team the semester prior to graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in Biology in May,2011. Following graduation she was offered a position at Aveda where she works in the R&D department laboratories and plans to obtain her Masters degree in molecular biology shortly. Though short, her experience with the iGEM team was a pleasure and she wishes the team the best at competitions!
Viki Ding
Viki is a senior at the University of Minnesota, pursuing a degree in microbiology. It took her two years in college to find her calling, but she has found it in microbes. After completing her undergraduate program, she will seek further education in the study of pharmaceutical practices. During her free time, she enjoys playing tennis, watching action movies, and spending time with friends. While she thinks micro-locally, she eats globally!
Sukdong Lee
Sukdong Lee is a junior majoring in biochemistry at the University of Minnesota. He enjoys playing tennis and chess amongst other things. iGEM was his first experience with research and now has acquired a deeper understanding of research. Upon graduation, he would like to attend pharmacy school. Someday, he would like to visit Australia to see the Great Barrier Reef and all the poisonous animals thriving there.
Sung Bong Lee
Sung Bong graduated from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities on May 2011 where he received a Biology B.S degree. He was involved in iGem team from spring semester, 2011 to summer, 2011 and worked on the regulatory aspect of the project. Sung Bong has since returned to his home country, South Korea, where he is fulfilling his mandatory military service. Sung Bong is interested in dentistry, especially maxillofacial and orthodontics and will be applying to dental school upon completion of his military service.
Honglin Li
Honglin is a rising junior majoring in biology. This is her second year at University of Minnesota. She used to study biomedical engineering at Montana State University for two years. Although she's on the premed track, she still would love to explore more options in many different areas. She especially loves drawing and playing music. Honglin has studied the Chinese zither for 7 years. During her free time she enjoys searching for good food in the twin cities.
Reginald Sudarta
Reggie a senior at the University of Minnesota majoring in Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development. He joined iGEM to gain a deeper understanding of genetics and molecular biology although there are a lot of interesting things to explore in biology. After graduation, Reggie plans to pursue a career in healthcare management. In his free time, Reggie enjoys playing soccer and basketball.
Brian Woolums
Brian graduated from the University of Minnesota in the Summer of 2011 with a degree in Neuroscience and Biochemistry. He plans to continue his education by attending graduate school and pursuing a doctorate degree in Neuroscience or Molecular Biology. He hopes to incorporate the Synthetic Biology line of thought learned from his iGEM experience to one day design treatments for neurological disorders at the molecular level. In his free time he's always ready for a game of pickup basketball, or to watch his beloved Wild, Twins, Vikings, Timberwolves, or Gophers play, regardless of how disheartening they've been  with in the last calender year.
Daniele Young
Daniele Young is a senior at the University of Minnesota, majoring in genetics, cell biology, and development and minoring in business management. Throughout a majority of her undergraduate career, Daniele has investigated the molecular mechanisms under which mammalian G-protein gated ion channels act. Focusing on the role G-proteins play in connection with drugs of abuse, Daniele continues to conduct research under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Wickman. Her research experience was further expanded with participation in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). Daniele’s UROP project explored the correlation between protein structure and function of potassium channels in the central nervous system. In addition to research, Daniele participates in a variety ways around campus. She has taught general biology lab for the University of Minnesota. Moreover, she has been an integral part of many campus clubs, including: Major Mentor Program, Orientation and First-Year Programs, University-YMCA, Colleges Against Cancer, Alpha Epsilon Delta, and the American Medical Student Association. Her extracurricular engagement extends into the community, volunteering to assist local businesses and area hospitals. Beyond academic involvement, Daniele dedicates her spare time to music promotion, production, and performance with a Twin Cities based company. Despite her diverse experiences, Daniele looks forward to a prosperous career as a physician.
