Antibiotics
Prepare stock solutions of antibiotics for adding to media (1 µL per 1 mL)
Ampicillin            100 mg/mL in water
Chloramphenicol 50 mg/mL in ethanol
Kanamycin          30 mg/mL in water
Media Preparation
LB media
10 g/L Tryptone
5 g/L NaCl
5 g/L Yeast Extract
15 g/L Agar (solid media only)
One sleeve (20 plates) can be made with 600 mL of solid media (autoclave, cool, and add antibiotics before pouring)
One rack (72 16x100 mm tubes with 4 mL) can be made with 300 mL of liquid media (autoclave after pouring)
SOC media
20 g/L  Tryptone
5 g/L  Yeast Extract
0.5 g/L  NaCl
950 mL/L ddH2O
pH to 7.0, autoclave, cool, and add the following
5 mL/L  2M MgCl2 (filter sterilize)
20 ml/L  20 mM Glucose Final Concentration* (Add 0.018 g/mL and filter sterilize)
TSS Method for Competent Cell Preparation
TSS Solution
Use the following recipe to make 100 mL:
PEG 4000    15 g
1 M MgCl2-solution  5 mL
LB liquid media   add to 95 mL
DMSO    5 mL (add after autoclaving)
Adjust pH to 6.5 prior to autoclaving.
After addition of DMSO aliquot TSS solution in 10 – 15 mL portions and store at –20 0C (TSS can get contaminated very quickly).
Competent Cell Preparation
Cultivate overnight E. coli culture* (*LB, add appropriate antibiotics if competent cells containing a plasmid for co-transformation are required) to inoculate main culture* 1:100 with overnight culture.
Note: 50 mL culture will give 10 aliquots of competent cells, Use larger culture volumes (e.g. 100 mL) to prepare more aliquots.
Grow main culture at 37 0C and 260 rpm to ensure rapid growth to OD 0.4 – 0.6 (typically 2 – 3 hours, fast growing cells to OD 0.4 reach highest transformation efficiencies)
Centrifuge cells for 10 min at 4000 rpm (4 0C)
Carefully resuspend cell pellet in cold (4 0C) TSS solution (2 mL TSS for each 50 mL culture volume).
Incubate resuspended cells for 5 min on ice and aliquot 200 µL competent cells in 15 mL sterile tubes.
Note: Handle cells carefully and keep them always on ice as they get very fragile during the TSS treatment.
Shock-freeze aliquoted cells in liquid nitrogen and store cells at –80 0C.
Restriction Digest
Prepare the following reaction mixture for a double digest:
3 µL  Appropriate 10X Buffer (choose to maximize activity efficiencies)
1 µL  Restriction Enzymes (two, 1 µL each)
10 µL  Template DNA with compatible restriction sites
16 µL  ddH2O
Allow reaction to incubate for >2 hours or overnight at 37 0C
Inactive restriction endonucleases by heating at 65 0C for 10 min
Check results on agarose gel
Isolate DNA from appropriate sized band with gel purification kit (Invitrogen or GE)
Ligation
Prepare the following reaction mixture:
2 µL  Ligase Buffer
1 µL  T4 Ligase
5 µL  Plasmid (Cut with restriction enzymes)
12 µL  Insert (Flanked with restriction sits compatible with plasmid and cut with them)
Allow reaction to incubate overnight at room temperature
Transform reaction mixture
Primer Design
Primers are the 5’ ends of the sequence to be amplified by PCR
Choose primers that have similar melting temperatures (Tm) that are between 50 0C and 65 0C
Choose primers that have low complementation with sequence of interest
Restriction sites are normally introduced to the 5’ end of primers to aid assembly into vectors (BglII and NotI for BioBrick vectors)
Include a G or C nucleotide at the 3’ end
Primer sequences are reported and ordered in 5’ to 3’ direction
Reconstitute primer in 10 µL for every nmol reported on tube (100 pmol/µL final concentration)
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Prepare reaction mixture in 200 µL PCR Tubes with following recipe:
1 µL  Template DNA
1 µL  Each primer (Forward and Reverse)
5 µL  10X Thermopol Buffer
1 µL  10 mM dNTPs
2.5 µL  10 mM MgSO4
0.5 µL  DNA Polymerase (Taq or Vent)
38 µL of Water to bring final volume to 50 µL
Program themocycler with the following:
Initial Denaturation   5 min    95 0C
Repeat  25 times
**Denaturation  30 sec           95 0C    **Annealing   30 sec >3 0C below lowest primer Tm  **Extention   1 min per 1 Kb  72 0C  **Final Extention  5 min   72 0C  **Storage    ∞   4 0C
Check reaction with 1% agarose gel (0.01 g/mL) in TAE buffer
Use 2% agarose gel when checking fragments <500 bp
If necessary, purify DNA using agarose gel purification kit
Transformation
Thaw competent cells at room temperature on ice
Add 1 µL of plasmid DNA or ligation reaction mixture to cells
Incubate on ice for 20 min
Heat shock at 43 0C for 40 sec
Add 800 µL of SOC to cells
Incubate at 37 0C for 1 hour
Plate 50 µL of culture or for ligations, spin down, remove 900 µL media, resuspend cells, and plate on solid media with appropriate antibiotic
Incubate at 37 0C for >18 hours
Pick colonies and transfer to 4 mL cultures with appropriate antibiotic (add antibiotic to liquid LB before cells)
Incubate at 37 0C for >18 hours
Use Miniprep kit (made by Promega) to purify plasmid DNA from overnight culture
Sequencing
Sequencing is conducted by the University of Minnesota Biomedical Genomic Center
Make 1:100 dilution (1 pmol/µL) of stock primers for sequencing purposes
Prepare the following mixture in 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube:
4 µL  diluted primer
X µL Template DNA in vector (100 ng per Kb template, X = 100 x n Kb/DNA concentration (ng/µL))
Y µL Sterile water to reach final volume of 13 µL
Name sequencing reaction with 3 letter prefix plus next highest unused number (ex. GEM01)
Flow Cytometry
Inoculate single colony of freshly transformed DH5αPro or TOP10 cells in 4 ml LB medium containing 50μg/ml chloramphenicol (or appropriate antibiotic).
Grow the culture overnight at 37 C with shaking (250 rpm).
Next day re-inoculate the cultures into 4 ml fresh LB medium having antibiotics and varying inducer concentrations. Inducer concentrations can be varied from 0-1mM of IPTG or 0-200 ng/ml aTc.
Collect the samples at different time intervals of 3, 6 and 9 hours.
Monitor the growth rate by measuring optical density at 600 nm.
Measure the fluorescence in a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm argon laser and a 515-545 nm emission filter (FL-1) and a 585-610 nm emission filter (FL-2).
Make sure that machine has settings for E. coli.
To measure the fluorescence, add 3-5 μl of the growing culture in ~1 ml PBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH-7.5). Measurement should be done at low flow rate (~1000 events/second).
For each sample, collect 50,000 events.
Analyze the fluorescence in both FL-1 and FL-2 channel using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
Determine the background fluorescence by using controls (cells having empty plasmid vector).
