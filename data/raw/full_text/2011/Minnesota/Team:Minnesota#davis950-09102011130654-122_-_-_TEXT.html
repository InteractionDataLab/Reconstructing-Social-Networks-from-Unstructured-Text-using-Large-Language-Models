Purpose: to digest pUCBB-lacZ, pBBR, and ompR with suitable restriction enzymes to facilitate replacement of pBBR promoter with ompR promoter. Because pBBR is a low copy number plasmid, we have elected to perform the same steps in tandem with pUCBB-lacZ which is a high copy number plasmid.
Procedure:
The following digestion reactions were set up:
16 ul ddH2O
3 ul NE buffer 2
1 ul XbaI
1 ul BglII
10 ul ompR
16 ul ddH2O
3 ul NE buffer 2
1 ul XbaI
1 ul BglII
10 ul pUCBB-lacZ
16 ul ddH2O
3 ul NE buffer 2
1 ul XbaI
1 ul BglII
10 ul pBBR
Results: None
