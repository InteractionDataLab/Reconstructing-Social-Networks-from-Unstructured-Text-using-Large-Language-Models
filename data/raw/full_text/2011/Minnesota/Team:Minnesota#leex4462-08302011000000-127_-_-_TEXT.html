Purpose:
-Gel extract the digested pBAD and silicatein
-Ligate these components
-Miniprep TOPO Silicatein
-Start pBAD liquid cultures
-Transform all ligations
Procedures:
Same
Results:
The TOPO Silicatein had 2 bands. One band at 850 bp and another at 1000 bp.
*Note: We realized that the silicatein had another BglII site within the gene so new primers were ordered.
Revision: Updated 9/27/2011 to include image.
