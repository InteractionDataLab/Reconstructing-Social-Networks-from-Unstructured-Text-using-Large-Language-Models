Purpose:
Designed primers for the E. coli BL21 strain of E. coli to obtain the OmpA gene for the silicatein surface display.
We designed the primers to have the BglII at the beginning. Then the gene followed by a NheI site which ended with a stop codon and a NotI site. The NheI site is so that we can cut the gene out later for the fusion.
