Immobilization and recrystallisation of S-layer proteins
You have your S-layer protein monomer solution? Then you are no longer than five hours away from your nanobiotechnological device - and this only because you have to wait 4 hours for the recrystallization and immobilization of your S-layer proteins. But before you begin...
Choose your surface
Silicon dioxide beads.
A silicon wafer.
S-layers can reassemble on various different surfaces like gold, nylon, functionalized glass or silicon dioxide. We used silicon dioxide because it is low-priced and easy to handle. For microscopy we used silicon wafers with a silicon dioxide surface. Then...
Let the immobilization begin
A vertical rotator which we used for coating silica beads with S-layers.
HBSS and recrystallization buffer for recrystallization.
High-throughput coating of silica beads.
Using silica beads
Weigh in 100 mg silica beads in a 2 mL reaction tube, add 900 µL HBSS buffer (pH 7.4, for SgsE) or recrystallization solution (pH 9.0, for SbpA) and 100 µL of your monomeric solution. You need these buffers because the S-layers we provided only self-assemble in the presence of ions e.g. calcium. Incubate the mix 4 h at room temperature on a vertical rotator. Bring down the beads afterwards by centrifugation, wash them with ddH2O and store them in ddH2O at 4 °C - finished. Now you have silica beads coated with your own functionalized nanobiotechnological surface. This is what we call do it yourself nanobiotechnology. The methods for recrystallisation were developed at and published by the BoKu Wien ( view references ).
Silicon wafers
Silicon wafers are not that cheap and not that applicable as silica beads but they represent a very plane surface. Using silicon wafers with a silicon dioxide surface: Cut or break the wafer into small pieces, place it in a 1.5 mL reaction tube, add 900 µL HBSS buffer (pH 7.4, for SgsE) or recrystallization solution (pH 9.0, for SbpA), add 100 µL of your monomeric solution and wait for 4 h (room temperature). Rinse the wafer with ddH2O and store it in ddH2O at 4 °C until use. The methods for recrystallisation were developed at and published by the BoKu Wien ( view references ).
