Cultivation
Expression of S-layer genes in E. coli
Chassis: Promega's E. coli KRX
Medium: LB medium supplemented with 20 mg L-1 chloramphenicol or autoinduction medium
Cultivations in LB-medium were supplemented with 0.1 % L-rhamnose as inducer, when the designated OD600 was reached.
Autoinduction medium for expressing <partinfo>K525304</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525305</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525306</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525405</partinfo>,  was supplemented with 1 mM IPTG .
For characterising the expression rate and the influance on E. coli growth behavior an automatic sampling system (Gilson fraction controller F2XX cooled (< 4 °C) with Julabo F10 water bath BU) was used. These cultivations were carried out in an Infors AG AQUATRON.
150 mL culture in 500 mL shaking flask with baffles (Schott) with silicon plugs
Cultivation temperature: 37 °C at 120 rpm
Expression of bisphenol A degrading BioBricks in E. coli

Bioreactor cultivations with E. coli KRX
To obtain higher amounts and concentration of proteins we cultivated and expressed in a bioreactor. It is possible to cultivate several liters and to control temperature, pH and DO.
Bioreactor: Bioengineering NLF22 7 L or Bioengineering KLF bioreactor with Bioengineering DCU
Medium: HSG medium with 20 mg L-1 chloramphenicol or 100 mg L-1 ampicillin
Culture volume: 2.5 - 5 L
Starting OD600: 0.1 - 0.4
DO: 40 % airsaturation (controlled with stirrer cascade starting with 200 rpm)
pH: 7.0 (controlled with 20 % phosphoric acid and 2 M NaOH)
Antifoam: BASF pluronic PE-8100
Induction after 4 h cultivation time with 0.2 % rhamnose and 1 mM IPTG (in culture medium)
Harvest after 8 - 13 h
Purification methods
Enzymatic cell lysis with lysozyme
After cultivation biomass was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 g at 4 °C for 20 min.
1 g of biomass (wet weight) was suspended in 10 mL of enzyme buffer containing 0.1 % Triton X-100, 2 µL benzonase (250 U/µL) and 40 µL of lysozyme (100 mg mL-1)
Incubation for 30 min at 4 °C
reaction mixture was centrifuged for 30 - 90 min at 15,000 g at 4 °C
Release of periplasmic protein fraction from E. coli by cold osmotic shock
Modified protocol from Neu & Heppel, 1965 .
Centrifuge E. coli cell suspension for 5 min at 14,000 g (4 °C) to collect the cells.
Discard the entire supernatant.
Resuspend the cells ice-cold cell fractionating buffer 1 . The resulting volume should be 1/4 of the former suspension volume.
Incubate for 20 min on ice. Ivert the suspension at regular intervals to counteract sedimentation.
Centrifuge the cell suspension for 15 min at 14,000 g (4 °C).
Discard the entire supernatant.
Resuspend the cells ice-cold cell fractionating buffer 2 . The resulting volume should be 1/4 of the former suspension volume.
Incubate for 10 min on ice under regular invertion.
Centrifuge the cell suspension for 15 min at 14,000 g (4 °C).
Save the supernatant, which contains the periplasmatic proteins.
If the periplasmatic protein fraction is turbid, re-centrifuge and filter it through a 0.2 µm filter.
Inclusion body clean-up
harvest the cells by centrifugation (30 min, 10,000 g, 4 °C)
resuspend pellet and disrupt cells
