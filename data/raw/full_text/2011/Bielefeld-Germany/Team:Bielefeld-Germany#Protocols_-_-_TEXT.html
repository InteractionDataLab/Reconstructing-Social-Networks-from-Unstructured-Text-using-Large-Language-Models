Here you can read more about our methods for cloning and BioBrick assembly.
Genetic engineering is a basic tool of synthetic biology. With the help of standardized DNA building blocks it is comparatively easy to create new and modify existing natural systems. The methods we have used in our project to modify DNA are presented here
Production
These are the protocols for the cultivations and the downstream processing.
Before the work with a cell-free system based on biological material can start, the needed proteins for this have to be produced and purified first. These methods and the one's we used to characterize BioBricks ''in vivo'' are presented here
Analytics
Protocols for the analytical methods we used.
DNA and proteins are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye. To control the success and the results of your upstream and downstream processes, analytical methods are necessary that give reliable results to make DNA or proteins in any way visible for you. The analytical methods we used in our project can be found here
