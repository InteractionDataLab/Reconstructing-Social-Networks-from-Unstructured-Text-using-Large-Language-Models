Evonik: Core specialty chemicals business Our strategy is aligned to profitable growth and sustained value creation. Our specialty chemicals activities address economic megatrends and give us access to attractive future markets. We see especially promising opportunities in resource efficiency, health and nutrition and the globalization. Our chemicals business already generated in 2010 around 80 percent of sales in areas in which it ranks among the market leaders, supported by unique technology platforms. Our strengths include a balanced spectrum of business activities and end-markets, close collaboration with customers, and market-oriented research and development.
Merck is a global pharmaceutical, chemical, and life science company with approximately 40,000 employees in 67 countries (as of December 31, 2010).
Within its Pharmaceuticals business sector, Merck discovers, develops, manufactures and markets innovative prescription medicines as well as over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. Merck also develops therapies for high unmet medical needs. Through their targeted effect, these help patients to live a longer and better life. Merck’s over-the-counter products can help prevent illness and relieve minor complaints.
The Chemicals business sector offers a very wide range of specialty chemicals for technologically sophisticated applications. The product portfolio ranges from products for the life science and biopharmaceutical sectors up to materials for products that people encounter in everyday life, such as mobile phones, televisions, automotive coatings, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Top quality and diversity characterize our Chemicals business, as does a customer-centric approach to research and product development along with extensive service.
Merck is the world’s oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company with roots dating back to 1668. From the start of industrial production in 1827 to first research on liquid crystals more than 100 years ago, up to our entry into targeted cancer therapy with the launch of Erbitux®, many milestones provide strong evidence of the pioneering spirit of the people at Merck. Whether with innovative drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, cold treatments, or new technologies for energy-efficient light sources - our pioneering spirit in research and our experience enable us to develop products that improve quality of life.
In 2010, the Merck Group generated total revenues of EUR 9.3 billion, with the Pharmaceuticals divisions accounting for EUR 6.2 billion and the Chemicals divisions for EUR 3.1 billion of the total. Research and development spending amounted to EUR 1.4 billion. The operating result totaled EUR 1.1 billion, and underlying free cash flow was EUR 1.7 billion. Return on sales (ROS) for the Merck Group was 12%.
Since going public in 1995, Merck’s operating activities have been under the umbrella of Merck KGaA. Today, around 30% of the company’s total capital is publicly traded, while the Merck family owns an interest of about 70% via the general partner E. Merck KG. Merck shares have been included in the DAX® 30, the blue chip index of Deutsche Börse, since 2007.
