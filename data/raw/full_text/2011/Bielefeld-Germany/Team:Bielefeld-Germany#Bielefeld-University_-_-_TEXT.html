Bielefeld University
Founded in the late 60`s Bielefeld University is one of the youngest members in the system of higher education in Germany. It is the largest of the six universities in Bielefeld with its 17.500 students and  2,600 staff (including approx. 1,480 academic staff). The university is divided into 13 different faculties, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines in the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and technology. Well known for its outstanding disciplinary social science faculty, the university also turned into a lighthouse of biotechnology during the last few years.
Since the founding of the so called CeBiTec (Center for Biotechnology ) in 1998 by the senate of Bielefeld University a huge range of techniques and equipment to cover all „omics“ research fields have been established. In the summer of 2007 the CeBiTec resided into a new building on the campus of Bielefeld University. The building offers laboratories for the Institute for Genome Research and Systems Biology, in particular for the Technology Platform Genomics. With focus on international collaborations, the platform hosts several techniques including sequencing (454 as well as illumina), transcriptomics and annotations over proteomics (GC-GC-MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, qTOF-MS) up to the metabolomics. Furthermore, the Chair of Genome Research is based in the building. Also the Institute for Biophysics and Nanosciences and the Institute for Biochemistry and Bioengineering run specific laboratories. This way, the CeBiTec creates an unique environment of excellent competence.
