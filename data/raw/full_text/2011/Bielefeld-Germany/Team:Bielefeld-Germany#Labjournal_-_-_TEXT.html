A higher inducer concentration results in a decreasing maximum and final optical density (OD600) but in a higher fluorescence level. The variations of the induction time point has no significant influence on growth and the progression of fluorescence.

Inducing time points and inducer concentration are named with following indices: (E1) induced early (cultivation time = 2,75 h) L-rhamnose end concentration = 0,1 %; (E2) induced early (cultivation time = 2,75 h) L-rhamnose end concentration = 0,2 %; (L1) induced late (cultivation time = 4,25 h) L-rhamnose end concentration = 0,1 %; (L2) induced late (cultivation time = 4,25 h) L-rhamnose end concentration = 0,2 %

S-layer:
Expression of K525131 (with TAT-sequence and lipid anchor), K5252133 (with lipid anchor), K525232 (nothing); K525233 (with lipid anchor) and K525234 (with TAT-sequence) in E. coli KRX to test the functional efficiency of Corynebacterium TAT-sequence in E.coli and the effect of the autoinduction protocol. After one day of cultivation, an increased fluorescence in all periplasm fractions of E. coli expressing S-layer constructs with TAT-sequence could be recognized. This is an indication that the Corynebacterium TAT-signal sequence is functional in E. coli. Comparing the manual and the autoinduction protocol, no significant changes in fluorescence (after 14 h) are identifiable.
Figure 4: Relative fluorescence of the S-layer/mRFP fusion proteins in the cell suspension less the distinct fluorescence of E. coli KRX. All cultivations were carried out in LB medium at 37 ˚C except K525131Glc which was in autoinduction medium. The expression of the S-layers in LB medium were induced adding 0,1 % L-rhamnose at OD600 = 0,6.
