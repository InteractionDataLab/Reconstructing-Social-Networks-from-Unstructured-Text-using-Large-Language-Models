In 2011 a student command unit locked themselves in the Bielefeld University for the construction of cell-free biosensors. They promptly identified S-layer proteins as nanobiotechnological building blocks. Today still characterizing their Bisphenol A Biosensor they are the iGEM team Bielefeld. If your cells are a problem, if no one else can help and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the Bisphenol A-Team.
