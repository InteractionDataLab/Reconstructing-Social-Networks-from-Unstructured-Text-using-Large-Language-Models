Partner
We successfully participated at the Europe Regional Jamboree
We were able to present our project to many interested people
We received inspiring and motivating feedback
We won a gold medal
We qualified for the iGEM World Championship at the MIT
And of course we had a lot of fun and an awesome good time
Project Achievements
We successfully laid the foundation for cell-free biosensors
We were the first team to immobilize functionalized S-layers and thereby creating defined nano structures ( Results )
We provided a system to quantify NAD+ highly sensitive and selective by the use of a ligase and molecular beacons ( Results )
We were able to degrade Bisphenol A quickly and selectively with E. coli ( Results )
We could show that all of our three subprojects function properly
We have created several new and working BioBricks (e.g. <partinfo>BBa_K525121</partinfo>, <partinfo>K525222</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K525305</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K525405</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K525512</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K525515</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K525710</partinfo>)
We showed that our BioBricks work as expected
We could successfully characterize these BioBricks and added the information to the Partsregistry
We improved the existing Bispenol A degrading BioBricks (<partinfo>BBa_K123000</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K123001</partinfo>)
We established a versatile NAD+ bioassay for future iGEM teams
We provided a nanobiotechnological S-layer protein toolkit for the iGEM community
We modeled our cell-free biosensor system and could show a correlation between BPA degradation and signal output ( Model )
We organized and participated in various events to improve the iGEM outreach ( Overview )
We implemented safety considerations in our project by working on a cell-free system
We got much attention in Germany shown by press reports and invitations to various events
We were able to manage the project on our own from the sketchbook to the final result
We managed to completely finance our project through sponsoring ( Sponsors )
