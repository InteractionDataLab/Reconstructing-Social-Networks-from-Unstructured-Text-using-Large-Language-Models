The construct consisting only of BisdA shows almost no degradation activity, which was expected since BisdA alone can't facilitate the degradation of BPA. In comparsion the fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB degraded BPA considerbly more efficent than the polycistronic construct, indicating that the fusing of the two proteins improved its activity. Regarding the constructs containing FNR the completely polycistronic construct lags distinctively behind the other two constructs. Again, the fusing of the BisdA and BisdB proteins improved the BPA degradation activity. Using the fusion protein between FNR, BisdA and BisdB we measured the highest specific BPA degradation rate of all constructs.

On average, this results in a 9 hours faster, complete BPA degradation by <I>E. coli</I> carrying &lt;partinfo&gt;K525517&lt;/partinfo&gt; compared to &lt;partinfo&gt;K525512&lt;/partinfo&gt; as observed during <A href="/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Results#Bisphenol_A_degradation_with_E._coli" title="Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Results"> our cultivations</A>. The fusion protein between BisdA and BisdB improves the BPA degradation by <I>E. coli</I>. Introducing a polycistronic ferredoxin-NADP<SUP>+</SUP> reductase gene into these systems does not lead to a higher specific BPA degradation rate. The rates are a bit lower, though. The effect that the BisdA | BisdB fusion protein is more efficient than BisdB when expressed polycistronically with BisdA can still be observed in this setup. The cultivations with the expression of the fusion protein FNR | BisdA | BisdB differ from the expression of the other BPA degrading BioBricks. The BPA degradation rate is concentration dependent which is typical for enzymatic reactions but was not observed in the other cultivations. In addition, the growth was faster and not diauxic. The maximal specific BPA degradation rate of this BioBrick is higher than the observed specific BPA degradation rates in the other cultivations. But due to the dependence of the BPA degradation from the BPA concentration the BPA degradation with this BioBrick is not as efficient and not complete. Anyway, the fact that this BioBrick is working, is impressive.

The SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 11) and the fluorescence (Figure 12) in the collected fractions showed that the majority of fusion protein was eluated with a imidazole concentration of ca. 50 mM. There was also fluorescence  measurable in the flowthrough and wash fractions. This indicates that the used 1 mL <I>HisTrap FF crude</I> (GE Healthcare) was overloaded or the protein was bound only weakly to the affinity matrix. The resulting purity in the elution fraction, the saving of time and the easiness makes this procedure to the preferred purification method.

Sometimes, the inclusion body purification does not give very clean fractions. Therefore, we developed another purification strategy for &lt;partinfo&gt;K525405&lt;/partinfo&gt; monomers after inclusion body purification. This strategy consists of a capture with an IEX followed by a purification with HIC. Because of issues with the PES membranes we used to rebuffer our samples (see below - PES binds most of the S-layers) we lost a lot of our proteins in this step between the two chromatographies. So there was not enough protein left to colour it with Coomassie in an SDS-PAGE and time ran out to perform a silver staining. The fluorescence of the collected fractions of the chromatographies is shown in the figures below.

It could be seen that the proteins form inclusion bodies in <I>E. coli</I> but that there are some soluble proteins left. This has the advantage that the proteins carrying an enzyme as fusion protein do not have to be treated with denaturating agents like urea which destroys the enzyme (data not shown).
</P><P>To capture the protein from the cell lysate an ion exchange chromatography (IEX) was carried out (binding with pH 7.0, 25 mM NaCl, quaternary amine beads, elution with 100 mM NaCl). A lot of protein was found in the flow-through. When concentrating and rebuffering the proteins with PES (polyethylene sulfone) membranes a lot of protein was lost. The S-layer proteins stuck to the membrane. Some could be removed again from the membrane after cutting out the filter and incubate it in ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O over-night. This problem has to be kept in mind when using this S-layer.

The inclusion bodies cannot be purified because urea damages the luciferase irreversible (data not shown). The loss due to adsorption of the SgsE | luciferase fusion protein to PES membranes could be avoided by using different membranes. The binding conditions of the IEX have to be improved as well. Anyway, the idea behind this purification strategy could be a starting point for a better strategy. Possibilities for improvement are:
</P><UL><LI> Different membranes for ultra- / diafiltration
</LI><LI> Other binding conditions for the IEX capturing step (higher pH)
</LI><LI> Hydrophobic interaction chromatography as purification step after IEX (works in general, data not shown)

After the IEX described above, the elution fraction was immobilized on silicon dioxide beads or just diluted with HBSS buffer which is used for the immobilization / recrystallization of SgsE S-layer proteins. The immobilization is carried out at room temperature for 4 h. It could be seen that the luciferase activity nearly expired during this time (in the positive and the negative control). So the S-layer SgsE could not stabilize the luciferase at room temperature. The results of this experiment is shown in Figure 17:

This was the case as soon as the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> concentration came below 2 nM. Deductively, the limit of detection of the molecular beacon based and LigA associated NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay was set at 2 nM NAD<SUP>+</SUP>. Furthermore, this confirmed the linear dependence between the initial velocity and the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> concentration (Figure 19).

The verification of the selectivity is an important matter to exclude any unspecific reactions which might result in a NAD<SUP>+</SUP>-independent fluorescence enhancement. Hence, a selectivity test for LigA was performed with the analytes NADH, NADP<SUP>+</SUP>, NADPH, 3-ADAP (NAD<SUP>+</SUP> with an exchanged functional group at the nicotinamide ring system), ATP and ADP, and the relative fluorescence enhancement rates in a NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay were compared with the one for NAD<SUP>+</SUP> (Figure 20).

The negative control (H<SUB>2</SUB>O) shows that there was a small background signal about 5 % of the signal that was produced by NAD<SUP>+</SUP> when using 100 nM of analytes. This marks the threshold for fluorescence enhancement which is caused by the employed analyte. NADH, NADPH and ATP were similar to the negative control and can thereby seen as analytes that do not enable DNA ligation by LigA. Only the values for the three analytes NADP<SUP>+</SUP>, 3-APAD and ADP were above the threshold, but they were constantly below 10 % of the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> signal. This leads to the suggestion that LigA ist highly selective for NAD<SUP>+</SUP> even in presence of structurally similar analytes. This makes the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay and the associated enzyme LigA suitable for investigating NADH-dependent enzyme reactions or measuring NAD<SUP>+</SUP> in biological analyte mixtures such as cell lysates.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Coupled_enzyme_reaction">Coupled enzyme reaction</SPAN></H3><P>The coupling of the LigA-including NAD<SUP>+</SUP> detection system was performed with a NADH-dependent enzymatic reaction which was in concrete the conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate by lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) from <I>E. coli</I>. For this the LDH reaction was done with an excess of NADH and various pyruvate concentrations. Afterwards, the reaction mix was transferred to a NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay and the fluorescence intensity was monitored. In Figure 21 the normalized initial fluorescence enhancement rates for the employed pyruvate concentrations are indicated. The calculated initial velocity was then plotted against the pyruvate concentration (Figure 22).

The addition of the LDH reaction mix resulted in a characteristic fluorescence enhancement rate depending on the employed pyruvate concentration. The existing correlation between both parameters seemed to be a linear. That the signal for 0 µM pyruvate was remarkably high could be the result of an pyruvate-independent transfer of electrons from NADH to the active site histidine of LDH under formation of NAD<SUP>+</SUP>. The limit of detection for pyruvate seemed to be near 1 µM pyruvate. That this value was not in nano molarity scale is firstly caused by 100-fold dilution of the LDH reaction mix after addition to the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay and secondly by the fact that LDH does not necessarily converte 100 % of the pyruvate to L-lactate. Nevertheless, for the LigA based NAD<SUP>+</SUP> detection system it has been proven that it can be coupled to NADH-dependent enzymatic reactions. This makes the NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay suitable for a wide range of biological studies dealing with the ubiquitous cofactors NADH/NAD<SUP>+</SUP>.

Hence, cloning of <I>rfp</I> into a pSB1C3 vector was performed with LigA. Ligation was done with NAD<SUP>+</SUP> bioassay buffer containing 10 mM NAD<SUP>+</SUP> at 37 °C or 22 °C and the vectors were transformed into <I>E. coli</I> KRX by electroporation.

As shown for the sample without any ligase only few clones were able to grow on chloramphenicol supplemented LB medium. A much bigger number of clones was observed when ligation by LigA was performed at 22 °C. Furthermore, there were a lot of red colonies indicating positive clones. Deductively, LigA might be useful for (large-scale) molecular cloning procedures which could be beneficial because of its easy production in <I>E. coli</I> and simple purification.
