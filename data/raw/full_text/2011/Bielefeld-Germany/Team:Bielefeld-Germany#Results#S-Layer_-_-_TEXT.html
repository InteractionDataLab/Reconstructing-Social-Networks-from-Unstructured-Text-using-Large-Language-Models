1 Summary of results
1.1 The S-layer protein PS2 of Corynebacterium glutamicum
1.2 The S-layer protein PS2 of Corynebacterium halotolerans
1.3 The S-layer protein SgsE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a
1.4 The S-layer protein SbpA of Lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM 2177
Summary of results
Four different S-layer BioBricks with various lattice structures were created and sent to the Partsregistry. The behaviour of these genes when expressed in E. coli was characterized and easy to perform purification strategies for the expressed proteins were developed. Two purified fluorescent S-layer fusion proteins from different organisms were immobilized on beads, leading to a highly significant fluorescence enhancement of these beads (p < 10-14). Furthermore, regarding the other two S-layers (CspB from Corynebacterium glutamicum and Corynebacterium halotolerans), we discovered that expression with a TAT-sequence and a lipid anchor resulted in an integration into the cell membrane, whereas the expression with a TAT-sequence alone resulted in a secretion into the medium. We also detected that those S-layers seem to stabilize the biological active conformation of mRFP. Furthermore, we expressed and purified a fluorescent CspB fusion protein from C. halotolerans which has not been expressed in E. coli before.
Have you ever wanted to try nanobiotechnology yourself?
Just follow our GUIDE TO DIY NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY and take a look how it is done:
The S-layer protein PS2 of Corynebacterium glutamicum
Characterization of expression and induction of different variants of CspB fused with a monomeric RFP ( BBa_E1010 ). Expression was observed through measurement of optical density and fluorescence. Click on the construct to view the results.

K525121
 CspB with TAT-sequence and lipid anchor 
K525123
 CspB without TAT-sequence and with lipid anchor 
Measurement of fluoresence to identify the location of the fusion protein in different fractions of the cells. Fractions were washed cells, the periplasm fraction after disruption of the periplasm, the supernatant after cultivation, the wash fraction of the pellet after lysis and wash with ddH2O, as well as the fractions after treating the pellet from lysis with different detergents.
Identification of location of fusion protein in the cell through fractionation with different detergents and periplasmatic disruption. Identification of protein-containing fractions with fluorescence measurement and MALDI-TOF. Table below shows the supposed location of the fusion protein in the cell, depending on presence of lipid anchor and TAT-sequence. Click on the construct to show the results.

Purification of the protein could be achieved through precipitation with ammonium sulfate, followed by ultra- and diafiltration. Salt concentration in the final anion exchange chromatography could be optimized to 400 mM NaCl (See: Purification and final strategy ).
The S-layer protein SgsE of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a
Characterization of expression and induction of K525305 , a translational fusion of the sgsE gene ( K525303 ) with mCitrine gene ( J18931 ). Expression was observed through measurement of fluorescence intensity and optical density (See: Expression in E. coli ).
Isolation and purification of the inclusion bodies using detergents, ultra- and diafiltration. Provision of methods to quickly obtain water-soluble fusion protein monomers for recrystallisation and coating through dialyzation (See: Purification of SgsE fusion protein inclusion bodies )
Fusing SgsE gen with His-tag and simple purification by using a denaturating His-tag affinity chromatography . This strategie has the advantage that no time-consuming and complex inclusion body purification and filtration is necessary. Additional to the simplification a higher purity could of the S-layer protein could be reached. (See: Purification of SgsE | mCitrine with His-tag )
Expression of SgsE|firefly luciferase (K525311) fusion protein under the control of a T7 / lac promoter in E. coli KRX.
Characterization of immobilization behaviour of proteins used to coat silica beads through measurement of fluorescence of supernatant, wash fraction and beads (See: Immobilization behaviour ).
Immobilization experiments to determine the optimal bead to protein ratio (See: bead to protein ratio ). Data could be fitted to a dose-response function. A good silica bead concentration for immobilization of 100 µg protein could be calculated to be approx. 150 - 200 mg mL-1.
