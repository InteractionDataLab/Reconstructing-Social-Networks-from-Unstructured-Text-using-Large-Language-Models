This page gives a basic overview about our cell-free bisphenol A biosensor system and the BioBricks we have used. A more detailed description of the biosensor system can be found in our project description as well as in the bisphenol A , S-layer and NAD+ detection background subsections.

How our system works
Figure 1: Production of the S-layer fusion proteins in E. coli. To build a cell-free bisphenol A biosensor the S-layer fusion proteins have to be extracted from the cells and purified (simplified schema).
Figure 2: Coating of the silica beads with the S-layer fusion proteins. Every silica bead gets covered with a geometric S-layer film consisting of an alternating structure of the two essential S-layer fusion proteins.
Figure 3: Visualization of our cell-free bisphenol A biosensor system with all essential components. Bisphenol A (BPA) is reduced by the electrons from NADH transferred by the ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR, <partinfo>BBa_K525499</partinfo>), ferredoxin (Fd, <partinfo>BBa_K123000</partinfo>) and cytochrome P450 (CYP, <partinfo>BBa_K123001</partinfo>) which are fused to a S-layer protein. The molecular beacon (hairpin structure) binds two short DNA oligos. The NAD+-dependent ligase (LigA, <partinfo>BBa_K525710</partinfo>), which is also fused to S-layer proteins, ligates the two oligos so that the hairpin structure opens up and the fluorophore is able to emit light after extinction.
Data for our favorite new parts
<partinfo>K525305</partinfo> - Fusion protein of S-layer SgsE and mCitrine: This fluorescent S-layer fusion protein is used to characterize purification methods and to demonstrate the S-layers ability to self-assemble on surfaces.
<partinfo>K525515</partinfo> - Fusion protein of BisdA and BisdB: This fusion protein improves the bisphenol A degradation in E. coli compared to the so far in the partsregistry existing BPA degrading BioBricks.
<partinfo>K525710</partinfo> - NAD+-dependent DNA ligase from E. coli (LigA) : This enzyme enables determination of NAD+ even in very low concentrations by introducing it to a molecular beacon based bioassay.
