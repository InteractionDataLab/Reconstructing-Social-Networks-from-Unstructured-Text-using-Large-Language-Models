11.6 nm between the proteinaceous subunits. The S-layer protein SgsE of <I>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</I> NRS 2004/3a consists of 903 amino acids, including a 30 amino acid signal peptide (SLH-domain) at the amino-terminus. 
The carboxy-terminal part of SgsE is the larger part of the protein, encoding the self-assembly information. The protein is formed by the <I>sgsE</I> gene, has a calculated mass of 93.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.1. When isolated, SgsE maintains its ability to self-assemble, and in dependence of salt concentration, duration of dialysis to remove the detergent and its amino acid sequence, it builds up five types of self-assembly products. These products are formed like flat sheets and cylinders (<A href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.200700200/abstract" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Schäffer <I>et al.</I>, 2007</A>).

Inclusion bodies have the advantage that they are relatively easy to clean-up and are resistant to proteases. The first purification step is to isolate and solubilize the inclusion bodies. This step is followed by two filtrations (300 kDa UF and 100 kDa DF/UF) to further concentrate and purify the S-layer proteins. After the filtrations, the remaining protein solution is dialyzed against ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O for 18 h at 4 °C in the dark. The dialysis leads to a precipitation of the water-insoluble proteins. After centrifugation of the dialysate, the water-soluble S-layer monomers remain in the supernatant and can be used for recrystallization experiments. 
</P><P>The fluorescence of the collected fractions of this purification strategy is shown in the following figure 4: 
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:702px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 4: Fluorescence of collected fractions during purification of &lt;partinfo&gt;K525305&lt;/partinfo&gt; fusion protein. </B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>A huge amount of protein is lost during the purification, especially after the centrifugation steps. The fluorescence in the urea containing fractions is lowered due to denaturation of the fluorescent protein. Some fluorescence could be regenerated by the recrystallization in HBSS. This purification strategy is very simple and can be carried out by nearly everyone in any lab, being the first step to enable do it yourself nanobiotechnology.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Purification_of_SgsE_.7C_mCitrine_with_His-tag">Purification of SgsE | mCitrine with His-tag</SPAN></H3><P>By fusing the SgsE | mCitrine with a C-terminal <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K157011" class="external text" rel="nofollow">His-6-tag</A> the S-layer protein could be simply purified by using a denaturating His-tag affinity chromatography. This purification strategy has the advantage that no time-consuming and complex inclusion body purification and filtration is necessary to decrease the amount of native <I>E. coli</I> proteins. Additional to the simplification a higher purity of the S-layer protein could be reached.
</P><P>This purification was performed using the SgsE fusion protein containing a N-terminal mCitrine,for identification and a C-terminal His-6-tag. The SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5) and the fluorescence (Fig. 6) in the collected fractions showed that the majority of fusion protein was eluated with a imidazole concentration of approx. 50 mM. There was also fluorescence  measurable in the flowthrough and wash fractions. This indicates that the used 1 mL <I>HisTrap FF crude</I> (GE Healthcare) was overloaded or the protein was bound weakly at to the affinity matrix. The resulting purity in the elution fraction, the saving of time and the simplicity makes this procedure the prefered purification method.

</P><P>First, SgsE is expressed in <I>E. coli</I> under the control of a T7 / lac promoter for separation of growth and production phase due to metabolic stress of the S-layer expression. Because the SgsE protein is forming inclusion bodies in <I>E. coli</I>, the cells were mechanically disrupted (Sonification on ice) in binding buffer containing 6 M urea. After centrifugation the supernatant is loaded as sample onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity column. The S-layer containing elution fraction of the denaturing His-tag affinity chromatography is afterwards dialysed against water. This leads to the precipitation of water-insoluble proteins. The supernatant contains the monomeric SgsE solution.

Because the SgsE protein is forming inclusion bodies in <I>E. coli</I>, an inclusion body purification with urea follows the cell lysis.

It could be seen that the proteins form inclusion bodies in <I>E. coli</I> but that there are some soluble proteins left. This has the advantage that the proteins carrying an enzyme as fusion proteins do not have to be treated with denaturating agents like urea which destroys the enzyme (data not shown).
</P><P>To capture the protein from the cell lysate an ion exchange chromatography (IEX) was carried out (binding with pH 7.0, 25 mM NaCl, quaternary amine beads, elution with 100 mM NaCl). A lot of protein was found in the flow-through. When concentrating and rebuffering the proteins with PES (polyethylene sulfone) membranes a lot of protein was lost. The S-layer proteins stuck to the membrane. Some could be removed again from the membrane after cutting out the filter and incubate it in ddH<SUB>2</SUB>O over-night. This problem has to be kept in mind when using this S-layer.
</P><P>The results of the purification approach are shown in Fig. 7:

The inclusion bodies cannot be purified because urea damages the luciferase irreversible (data not shown). The loss due to adsorption of the SgsE | luciferase fusion protein to PES membranes could be avoided by using different membranes. The binding conditions of the IEX have to be improved as well. Anyway, the idea behind this purification strategy could be a starting point for a better strategy. Possibilities for improvement are:
</P><UL><LI> Different membranes for ultra- / diafiltration
</LI><LI> Other binding conditions for the IEX capturing step (higher pH)
</LI><LI> Hydrophobic interaction chromatography as purification step after IEX (works in general, data not shown)

After the IEX described above, the elution fraction was immobilized on silicon dioxide beads or just diluted with HBSS buffer which is used for the immobilization / recrystallization of SgsE S-layer proteins. The immobilization is carried out at room temperature for 4 h. It could be seen that the luciferase activity nearly expired during this time (in the positive and the negative control). So the S-layer SgsE could not stabilize the luciferase at room temperature. The results of this experiment is shown in the figure below:
