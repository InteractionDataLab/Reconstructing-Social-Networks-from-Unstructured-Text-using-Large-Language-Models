Here is a brief introduction of each member's task.If you're looking for detailed information,look into the member's personal note.
Handuo Shi
Concentrated on a feedback gene network, I have constructed it as well as demonstrated its effectiveness. Moreover, I helped in the modeling of our system and fulfilled an algorithm so that we can construct our boolean logic gates in the simplest way.

Yiwei Chen
I took the responsibility for constructing the sRNA-dependent competitor with my partner Qin Xiao. Furthermore, our work mainly focused on the characterization of the response curve of competitor in E. coli, and finally contributed to the rational design of the competitor.

Hanchi Lin
Apart from mainly assisting in the molecular clonging of the XOR gate and depicting its function, I also spend time being engaged in taking advantage of some basic biological parts to set up other Boolean synthetic gate. This summer, I am also in charge of purchasing reagent consumables. This conduces to the guarantee of our project’s going on wheels.

Wenhan Luo
My major task is molecule cloning of generators and corresponding receivers for chemical wires such as A-factor. In addition, characterization of some logic gates like AND GATE as well as constructing a three input gate using new signaling molecules is my major contribution in the later stage of our poject. What is more, I am also responsible for the direction and manufacture of the CG animation about invertors.

Jingchen Feng
I am mainly responsible for the modeling work of our project. I model our balancer and give simulation result of balancer and XOR gate. Besides, under the guidance of Xiao Qing and Yiwei Chen I help constructing sRNA-dependent competitor. I also participate in the microfluidic work.

Jingyi Xi
Mainly in charge of microfluidic device, I created a bilayer microfluidic system for our project, which provides a suitable space for different cells to be spatially separated apart and population controlled, as well as allowing chemical wires to transfer freely from each side to the other. What’s more, I also took part in molecular cloning of TPP regulator, characterization of chemical wire toolbox, and modeling work of XOR gate.

Ruofan Yu
Since I'm mainly in charge of the team wiki and other chores,I don't have a specific task in our project.But I do help other teammates when they're having too many things on their to-do list.Please refer to Handuo Shi and Weiyue Ji's lab diary to get detailed imformation.
Linna Deng
I was in charge of construction of gene circuit in cell B, which played a role in the balancer of microbial population density created with supporting microfluid device. Additionally, I was responsible for the work in human practice.
