Acknowledgement
This human practice project could not be completed without the help of many people. We really appreciate students who support our work and spent time filling in questionnaires. Special thanks to the teachers in the high school attached to Capital Normal University for warmly welcoming our visit. Also, thanks to the Xiao Qin for spending time contacting high school for the survey even when she is busy working in the laboratory.
