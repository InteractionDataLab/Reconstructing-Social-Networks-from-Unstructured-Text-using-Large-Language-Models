Protocol for Ligation of Insert DNA into Plasmid Vector DNA
download PDF version
Materials:
Materials:
DNA sample(s) in water or TE buffer
10x ligation buffer
T4 DNA Ligase, 5 u/μl
ddwater
Procedure:
1. Test the concentration of the DNA sample(s).
2. Pipet the following into a microfuge tube:
a. Linearized vector DNA: around 100ng
b. Insert DNA (at 3:1 molar excess over vector): variable
c. 10x ligation buffer: 1uL
d. T4 DNA Ligase: 1uL
e. ddwater: Rest of volume
Total volume: 10 uL
3. Vortex and spin briefly to collect drops.
4. Incubate the mixture at 16 degree for 45-60min.
5. Use the ligation mixture for transformation.
Tips:
Thoroughly mix the 10x ligation buffer before use.
The optima l insert/vector molar ratio is 3:1.
To minimize recircularization of the cloning vector, dephosphorylate linearized plasmid DNA with Alkaline Phospha tase(CIAP) prior to ligation. Heats inactivate the phosphatase or remove from the mixture after the dephosphorylation step.
DNA purity is an important factor for successful ligation. Plasmids should be purified using a method that will ensure isolation of high quality DNA. Use only high quality agarose and fresh electrophoresis buffers for gel-purification of DNA fragments.
