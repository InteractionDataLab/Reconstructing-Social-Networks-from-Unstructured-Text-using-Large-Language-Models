Jingchen Feng's Notebook
Summary
I am mainly responsible for the modeling work of our project. I model our balancer and give simulation result of balancer and XOR gate. Besides, under the guidance of Xiao Qing and Yiwei Chen I help constructing sRNA-dependent competitor. I also participate in the microfluidic work.
Contents
6.24-7.12
Begin designing microfluidic device, with the help from GuangWei Si (graduate studying microfluidic). We decide the structure of the device to perform the required function. We further do preliminary experiments to test the performance of our device and it works as we expected.
7.12-9.5
Under the guidance of Xiao Qin and Yiwei Chen, I help constructing the competitor module and characterize its performance.Meanwhile, I write the code for our modeling work and run it on computers several times to check its correctness.
9.5-9.11
Give the first version of ODE equations to model our balancer. I also model the XOR gate during this period.(Basing on the J Christopher Anderson previous work)
9.11-9.20
Receive many advices from Qi OuYang (professor who in charge of our project) and modify our model, then give the second version.
9.20-9.27
Solve some problems encountered in mirofluidic and modify the performance of the device.
9.27-10.6
Finally check our model and put our simulation process and result on wiki.
