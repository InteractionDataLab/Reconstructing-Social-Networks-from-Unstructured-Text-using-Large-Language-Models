Data For Our Favorite New Parts
1- Main Page - SgrS2+Terminator (small RNA regulator, conjugate part of ptsG2), BBa_K581003: SgrS2 is the G176C mutant of SgrS(wt) and the conjugate part of ptsG2 in our comparator device. The design of such a site-mutation is on the one hand to restore its complementarity with ptsG2 and thus its gene silencing ability, and on the other hand to insure its orthogonality with the genetic context of the host cell. As a crucial component of our modular comparator device, both features are in favored.
2- Main Page - ptsG2-GFP (ptsG2 5'UTR fused with gfp), BBa_K581004: ptsG2 is the C87G mutant of ptsG(wt) and the conjugate part of SgrS2 in our comparator device. The purpose of the site-specific modification is to restore its complementarity with SgrS2 so it can be readily repressed. Also, the modified system is orthogonal to the genetic context of the host cell. The gfp here is working as a reporter gene to reflect the repression effect SgrS2 exerts on ptsG2.
3- Main Page - rhl repressible promoter-gfp-ssrA degradation tag, BBa_K581019: We ceated the rhl repressible promoter by positioning the rhl-box between and partially overlapping consensus -35 and -10 hexamers with 18 bp between the hexamers. When C4-HSL represents and binds to RhlR proteins, RhlR will bind to its DNA binding site, the rhl box, thus to reduce the accessibility of RNA polymerases to this promoter, repressing the transcription initiation. A GFP reporter with C-terminus fused ssrA degredation tag was used to report the transcriptional activity at the promoters.

Data For Our New Parts
1- Main Page - SgrS1+Terminator (small RNA regulator, conjugate part of ptsG1), BBa_K581000: SgrS1 is the G178C mutant of SgrS(wt) and the conjugate part of ptsG1 in our comparator device.
2- Main Page - ptsG1-GFP (ptsG1 5' UTR fused with gfp), BBa_K581001: This is the conjugate part of the small RNA sgrS1.
3- Main Page - RBS+cinI+Terminator, BBa_K581002: This is a cinI protein generator.
4- Main Page - Pc+sgrS(wt)+Terminator (small RNA regulator, conjugate part of ptsG(wt)), BBa_K581005: SgrS(sugar transport-related sRNA)(wt) is a small RNA regulator that help cells recover from glucose-phosphate stress by base pairing with ptsG(wt) mRNA. SgrS regulates ptsG mRNA by short, imperfect base-pairing interactions; as a result, the expression of PtsG is repressed.
5- Main Page - Pc+ptsG(wt)-GFP (ptsG(wt) 5' UTR fused with gfp), BBa_K581006: PtsG is a glucose permease which is subordinate to phosphotransferase system and serves as a transporter. Here,we studied this mRNA perform the conjugate part of the small RNA regulator sgrS(wt). ptsG mRNA is regulated by SgrS by short, imperfect base-pairing interactions, and its expression is thus repressed.
6- Main Page - RBS+GFP-ssrA, BBa_K581007: This is a GFP reporter tagged with the strong degradation tag ssrA.
7- Main Page - RBS+ccdB+Termintor, BBa_K581008: This is the cell death protein coding sequence under the control of a relatively weak RBS.
8- Main Page - pqrr-GFP ssrA degradation tag, BBa_K581009: GFP behind promoter qrr
9- Main Page - promoter(BBa_J23106)-RBS-luxU-RBS-cqsS-RBS-luxO, BBa_K581010: Regulatory proteins for receiving signaling of CAI-1.
10- Main Page - pBAD-rbs-cqsA-terminator, BBa_K581011: A generator of CAI-1 behind pBAD promoter.
11- Main Page - pqrr-rbs-T7ptag-terminator, BBa_K581012: T7ptag behind pqrr.
12- Main Page - lux repressible promoter-T7ptag-terminator, BBa_K581013: T7ptag behind a lux repressible promoter.
13- Main Page - lux repressible promoter-rbs-GFP-ssrA-terminator, BBa_K581014: GFP + ssrA degradation tag behind a lux repressible promoter.
14- Main Page - pBAD-supD-plux_inv-T7ptag, BBa_K581015: It is an AND Gate adopted from BBa_K228258.
15- Main Page - pT7-luxI-GFP-ssrA-terminator-pc-rbs-luxR, BBa_K581016: It is used as a subpart of our feedback loop.
16- Main Page - araC-pBAD-supD-nahR-psal-supD-pT7-rbs-gfp, BBa_K581017: It is a subpart of our XOR Gate.
17- Main Page - Pc+arpA+terminator, constitutive ArpA protein generator, BBa_K581020: This is a constitutive generator of the A-factor receptor protein, ArpA.
18- Main Page - RBS+afsA, BBa_K581021: It is the synthase for the Streptomyces quorum sensing molecule A-factor.
19- Main Page - A-factor regulated promoter, BBa_K581022: This the Streptomyces autoinducer A-factor regulated promoter built from the ground up.
