About Us
Our school
View of Lake Weiming
Our school, Peking University is a comprehensive and national key university, which was founded in 1898. It stands near to the Yuanmingyuan Garden and the Summer Palace. The university has effectively combined research on important scientific subjects with the training of personnel with a high level of specialized knowledge and professional skill. It strives not only for improvements in teaching and research work, but also for the promotion of interaction and mutual communication among various disciplines.  Thus Peking University has become a center for teaching and research and a university of a new type, embracing diverse branches of learning such as basic and applied sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and sciences of medicine, management, and education. Its aim is to rank among the world's best universities in the future.
