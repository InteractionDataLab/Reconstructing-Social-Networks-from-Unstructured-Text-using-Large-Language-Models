However, organization of engineered consortia requires effective cell-cell communication and currently harnessed quorum sensing modules are far from sufficient, giving the engineering of cell-cell communication an emergent priority. An ideal communication system primarily consists of four elements: Production, Perception, Cell sensitivity and Detoxification. Natural quorum sensing systems is advantageous in production ,perception and cell sensitivity. As for detoxification, it wouldn’t be a major problem if the receiver module is sensitive enough, which frequently occurs to natural regulators. Thus, harvesting ‘chemical wires’ from natural systems would be a feasible strategy.
</P><P>
Yet not every system composed of the elements above would give desired performance in engineered consortia. In order to achieve  relatively apparent outcome, proper cell sensitivity is required. Also, because long-term monitoring of population behavior remains a challenge, responding time of the signalling system should be kept in a short period. We set our third criterion on the ability to coordinate population members so as to diminish fluctuations in the system.
</P><P>According to such criteria , we selected two signal generator-receiver systems as the positive regulating members of our 'chemical wire' toolbox. One employs auto-inducer N-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecenoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OH-C14:1-HSL), as the signal molecule (Figure 1). The other system rewired the  heterogeneous producing and receiving systems of Salicylate into a synthetic signaling system(molecule illustrated in Figure 2). 
</P><P>Correspondingly we designed experiment verifying the performance of our devices from three aspects, namely dose response, time dependence and coordination.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Cin_system"> Cin system </SPAN></H4><P>This system was derived from  Gram-negative soil bacteria <I>Rhizobium leguminosarum</I> living in symbiotic association with legumes by forming nodules. In this system, cinI, pcin, cinR are core elements. CinI is a LuxI-family synthase, producing 3OH-C14:1-HSL and cinR is a LuxR-type transcriptional regulator responding to the molecules. Pcin will be activated by the binding of CinR -3OH-C14:1-HSL complex.
</P><P>As one of the widely-used AHL autoinducing luxI/luxR family members, cinI/cinR system meets the four elements quite well.
</P><CENTER><I>Figure 1. N-(3-hydroxy-7-cis-tetradecenoyl)-L-homoserine lactone chemical structure</I></CENTER><P>In order to verify our three criteria, we constructed 3OH-C14:1-HSL generator and receiver devices (shown in Figure 2) and experiments detecting dose response, time dependence and coordination of the device were performed.

Interestingly, there is a bacterium species named Pseudomonas aeruginosa which can synthesize salicylate. These two bacteria strains provide the possibility of constructing an artificial quorum sensing system.

Salicylate operon has a broad concentration response curve </SPAN></H5><P>We found that salicylate sensor NahR is able to response to salicylate among a wide concentration range. When induced with high concentration of salicylate, for instance, 10^-3M, the gene of interest regulated by pSal promoter will be dramatically expressed, while NahR could still sense salicylate even as low as 10^-6M.
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="2._Salicylate_would_not_cause_huge_burden_on_the_cell_metabolism"> 2. Salicylate would not cause huge burden on the cell metabolism </SPAN></H5><P>As a chemical wire, salicylate has small molar mass and simple chemical structure. The synthesis pathway of salicylate only involves two genes. As a result, metabolic burden will not be a hurdle when using salicylate as artificial quorum sensing molecules.

</P><P>
In order to characterize the system, generator device and receiver device were transformed into different strains. 
</P><P>
PchBA which locates at generator plasmid encodes an isochorismate pyruvate-lyase and an isochorismate synthase derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PchA, an isochorismate synthase, catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate. The enzyme PchB, catalyzes the conversion of isochorismate to salicylate. 
</P><P>
NahR is a polypeptide which plays an important role in salicylate operon. The polypeptide can exerts its salicylate-dependent activation sal operon by interacting with the promoter sequence in the region of -83 to -45 base pairs before the transcription start site. Binding of the inducer to the central domain of NahR is thought to cause additional interactions of NahR with sequences near the -35 and DNA bending, both of which promote transcriptional activation, therefore, so if there are no salicylate in the liquid nutrient medium, NahR will not binding on the promoter and lead to RNA ploymerase can not work normally, otherwise, transcription will be actived and downstream of the promoter will be transcripted, in our case, GFP will be expressed.
