Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:</B></P><PRE> •researcher safety, 
 •public safety, or 
 •environment safety?
</PRE><DIV style="float:right; padding-left:30px; width:300px; padding-bottom:50px;"><DIV style="margin-top:5px; font-size:12px; color:#6e6e6e; line-height:15px; text-align:center">safety measures taken during experiment</DIV></DIV><P>Since our project concentrates on developing a versatile and unique platform for bacterial cell-cell communication, there may beseveral safety issues relating to researchers, the public and the environment regarding the parts from pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, a laboratory regulation had been established according to national biosafety standards as well as with requirements from experienced supervisors. It is required that researchers follow strict guidelines during experiments to minimize their possible exposure to potential risks. Parts from pathogenic strains are also carefully dealt with to prevent any possible horizontal gene transfer to the environment outside. Specifically, bacterial cells are preserved in certain conditions and all the materials and instruments, wastes included, are sterilized with alcohol or bleach after experiments. In addition, our protocols are carefully designed to eliminate potential hazards to the public or to the environment.
</P><P><B>2.    Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,</B></P><PRE> •did you document these issues in the Registry? 
 •how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
 •how could other teams learn from your experience?
</PRE><P>No, none of our newly-made BioBrick parts would bring about any safety issues according to current professional information.  Although our system includes several genes from Vibrio cholera, Streptomyces griseus and S. coelicolor, respectively, these genes are not directly involved with virulence or antibiotic resistance in any case.
</P><P><B>3.    Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?</B></P><PRE> •if yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
 •if no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
</PRE><P>Yes. The project is supervised by several professors and managers in laboratory. The proposals, guidelines and protocols have been carefully revised regularly to ensure biosafety control.<A href="http://www.lab.pku.edu.cn/gzzdu.asp" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><B>The Office of Laboratory and Equipment of Peking University</B></A> is responsible for any of our relevant safety issues.

</A></P><P><B>4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?</B></P><DIV style="float:right; padding-left:30px; width:300px; padding-bottom:50px;"><DIV style="margin-top:5px; font-size:12px; color:#6e6e6e; line-height:15px; text-align:center">safety measures taken during experiment</DIV></DIV><P>Biosafety issues are not only academic topics but also ethic and public affairs. Thus, public engagement is of necessity and significance. Here we are proposing the idea of an online safety workshop in both academic and plain styles. With the workshop pages teams or any other visitors may have an easy excess toward the most essential knowledge regarding researcher safety, public safety and environment safety as well as participate in the assessment of projects.  Also, more new ideas about safety control might be collected through online forums. In addition, it is also a good idea to encourage safety issues to be discussed in human practice.
In order to minimize potential hazards through engineering, special attention should be placed on horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Engineered lab strains are less likely to compete with wild type strains in field niche and consequently HGT is the more possible occurrence for public or environmental safety issues.
Since safety characteristics of a system may vary with its component gene parts, orthogonality and distribution of the system and self-destruction devices within single plasmids should be encouraged. By developing biologically orthogonal platform and distributing whole system into different membrane-insulated cells, HGT of any single gene would probably not give rise to negative effects of the system working together. As for the single gene case, a suicide system integrated in the standardized backbones may help. E.g. the plasmids could encode endogenous toxins, while engineered lab strains chromosomally bear anti-toxin gene. Toxin will work once the plasmid accidentally transformed, so that the hazards of HGT would be further reduced.
