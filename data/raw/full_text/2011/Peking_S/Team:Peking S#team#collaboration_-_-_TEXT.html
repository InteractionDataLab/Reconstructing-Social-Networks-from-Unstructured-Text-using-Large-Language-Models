At the Center for Theoretical Biology, He gave a talk on the introduction to Slovenia and University of Ljubljana, the experience of previous iGEM Slovenia teams, and modeling and bifurcation analysis of biological systems. Prof. Miha Mraz’s visit has surely promoted the link and communication between Slovenia team and Peking University team.
