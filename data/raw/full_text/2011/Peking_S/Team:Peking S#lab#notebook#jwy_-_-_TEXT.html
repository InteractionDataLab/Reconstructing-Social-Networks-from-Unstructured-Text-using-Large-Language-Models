7.1
Miniprep of the plasmids which contain pqrr, J23106+B0034+luxU, padpA gene respectively and send for sequencing.
7.3
Get the result of sequencing and the sequence of J23106+B0034+luxU has a mutation which need to be corrected. Design primers for J23106+B0034+luxU mutation.
7.5
Get mutation primers and mutate the plasmid using TaKaRa MutanBEST Kit.
7.6
Pick six clones each plate and shave at 37℃ to amplify the bacteria. Miniprep of the plasmids.
7.7
Send the plasmid of J23106+B0034+luxU mutants for sequencing.
7.8 - 7.15
As for the initial results of DNAWorks assembly for cqsS, cqsA, luxO were not good, we changed the reaction conditions and tried many other alternative method. However, the consequence still remain disappointing. So we decide to get the strain of Vibrio cholerae and use the method of PCR:
cqsS, cqsA, luxO PCR using different annealing temperature, with gradient 4 ℃.
Identify them by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Excise the gel slice of cqsS, cqsA, luxO and extract the fragments.
ligase the products of gel extraction to the vector pEASY-Blunt.
Transformation.
7.16
Send the plasmid of  cqsS, cqsA, luxO for sequencing.
Since there are some EcoR1, Pst1, Xba1 restriction sites in the original sequence of cqsS, cqsA, luxO, We design primers for point mutatiion to eliminate the restriction sites.
7.18
Get mutation primers and mutate the plasmid using TaKaRa MutanBEST Kit.
7.19
Pick five clones each plate and shave at 37℃ to amplify the bacteria.
Miniprep of the plasmids.
7.20
Send the plasmid of cqsS, cqsA, luxO mutants for sequencing.
7.22
Get the result of sequencing.
Make the second point mutation in cqsS.
7.23
Pick five clones in cqsS mutants plate and shave at 37℃ to amplify the bacteria.
Miniprep of the plasmids.
7.24
Send the plasmid of cqsS mutants for sequencing.

7.25 - 8.12
1.Put the double digested fragments of J23106+B0034+luxU, cqsS, luxO in the ligation reaction system in 16℃ for 2-4 hours, then add the EcoR1 and Pst1 double-digested vector pSB1C3 for 4 hours.
Transform the ligation reaction system.
16-18 hours later, pick six to ten clones in the plate and shave at 37℃ to amplify the bacteria. Miniprep of the plasmids.
