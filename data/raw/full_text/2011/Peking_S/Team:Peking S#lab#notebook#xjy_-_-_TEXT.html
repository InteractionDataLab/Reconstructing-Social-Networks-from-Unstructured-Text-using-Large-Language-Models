Jingyi Xi's Notebook
Summary
Mainly in charge of microfluidic device, I created a bilayer microfluidic system for our project, which provides a suitable space for different cells to be spatially separated apart and population controlled, as well as allowing chemical wires to transfer freely from each side to the other. What’s more, I also take part in molecular cloning of TPP regulator, characterization of chemical wire toolbox, and modeling work of XOR gate.
