Yanrong Ma's Notebook
summary
In our project I cloned genes of A-factor synthase afsA and A-factor receptor arpA,and I also standardized these two genes .Besides, I also constructed and characterized quorum sensing genes named cinI and cinR. I further characterized its feasibilities in constructing synthetic microbial consortia.
Contents
6.24-7.5
Molecular cloning training . such as transformation and DNA ligation and Enzyme digestion.
7.6-7.7
Obtaining Streptomyces strain from professor Honglong and acquired some skills in Streptomyces culturing.
7.8-7.12
Usinig PCR strategy to get a-factor generator gene afsA and a-factor receptor gene arpa from Streptomyces genome.
7.13-7.23
Using different polymerases(prime star、esay pfu、TAG ) in PCR to gain afsa and arpa genes from the Streptomyces strain. And we finally got those two genes by changing many PCR parameters.
7.24-8.13
Constructing the A-factor receive system including constitutively expressed arpA and a gfp whose expression is controlled by arpA and afsA synthesized molecules.
8.14-9.5
Testing performance of afsA/arpA system.
9.6-9.18
Constructing cinI/cinR system which mainly contains constitutively expressed cinR and a gfp controlled by cinR and cinI synthesized chemical molecules.
9.19-10.1
Characterizing of cinI/cinR system.
