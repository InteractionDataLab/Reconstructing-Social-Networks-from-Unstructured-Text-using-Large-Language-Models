-Speeding Up-
-Treat restriction enzyme
HNS(wt) -> X,S
I120260 -> Bln I
for two hours.
-DNA refining
Phenol/Chloroform preparation and ethanol precipitation
-Measurement of DNA concentration
0.04 ug/ml
-Ligation
HNS(wt):I20260 (expect GFP) = 3:1
-Transformation Transformed DAN solution.
-Visualization-
-Plasmid extraction
-Treat restriction enzyme (only S)
-Electrophoresis
Results
Cleared plasmid extraction but retest to check for the protocol.
Checked plates
Checked plates transformed after ligate one day ago. Checked colony on all plates J23100:K317037 = 1:4,1:8 and 1:0.
Treated restriction enzyme
Treated P0440 restriction enzyme with xba and pst and incubated at 37 deg C for 6 hours.
Colony PCR
Did colony PCR for 32 colony (16 colony for J23100:K317037=1:4, 14 colony for J23100:K317037=1:8 and 2 colony for only J23100).
Master plates have been incubating.
Electrophoresis
Checked results for colony PCR and treated restriction enzyme by electrophoresis. Showed two bands with colony PCR. Did not show bands with P0440 treated restriction enzyme.
Pre-cluture
Pre-clutured six tubes : three P0440 (named Mr.P, P-chan and P-ko) and colony of master plates (10,16 and 26). Liquid midum contained ampicillin. Colony of master plates used showing a band by electrophoresis. Incubated at 37 deg C after pre-cluture.
-Electrophoresis
-Gel refining
-Electrophoresis
-Digestion
Details
-Electrophoresis
Checking for OriTr + GFP (1,2) and OriTr (3,4)
Marker was 5 ul Gene ladder wide.
Chceked four binds.
-Gel refining
c.f. 4th Aug.
Refined with 1 and 2, 3 and 4 in tubes.
-Electrophoresis
Checked for complete to gel refine.
Run 3 ul + 3 ul Loading buffer.
Marker was 5 ul Gen ladder wide.
Did not show bands.
Used sample without ethanol when gel refining.
-Digestion
Did redoing because could not gel refinging.
-Targeting-

Digestion
Digested P0440 with xba and pst and incubated at 37 deg C for 6 hours.
Colony PCR
Did colony PCR for 32 colony (16 colony for J23100:K317037=1:4, 14 colony for J23100:K317037=1:8 and 2 colony for only J23100).
