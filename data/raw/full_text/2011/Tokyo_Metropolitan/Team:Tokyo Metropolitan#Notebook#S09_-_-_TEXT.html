-Targeting-
-Plasmid extraction and DNA refining
Extracted plasmid and refined DNA used Cell Biochemical Lab's kits for No. 29 of J23100-K317037 and No. 19 of J23100-P0440.
Results measured concentration
No. 29 of J23100-K317037 was 150.
No. 19 of J23100-P0440 was 138.
J22005
I. 105
II. 155
III. 62
concentration was ng/ul
-Treat restriction enzyme
J23100-K317037 -> S and P
J23100-P0440 -> E and P
