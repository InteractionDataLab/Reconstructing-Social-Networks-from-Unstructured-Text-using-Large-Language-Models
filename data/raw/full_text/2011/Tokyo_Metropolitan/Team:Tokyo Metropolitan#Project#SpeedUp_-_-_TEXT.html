Speeding Up Device
Speeding Up Device makes E.coli to move in higher speed than usual. E.coli have HNS protein gene in their genome. HNS is an Escherichia coli nucleoid protein known only to function as a modulator of gene expression. Gina M. Donato said that specific single amino acid substitutions in H-NS caused an approximately 50% increase in flagellum rotational speed (*1).  So we have E.coli to express HNS mutant T108I gene with plasmid.
Parts Design
We designed the part BBa_K543003 HNS mutant T108I protein generator. With this part, chassis would produce HNS mutant T108I protein and get hight speed move.
BBa_K543003
Assay
Swarm plate assay*1
Fresh colonies from strains carrying the indicated alleles were inoculated onto semi-solid agar plates and grown at 30 °C. Growth is measured as the diameter of the bacterial swarm over several time points. Bacteria with swarm diameters under 10 mm at the end of 17 h incubation were considered non-motile.

Result
Succeeded in clonning of HNS wild type protein and registried it for BBa_K543000 .
402 guanine is mutated into cytosine in this part to prevent XbaⅠ digesting it.
And more...please visit our presentation.
