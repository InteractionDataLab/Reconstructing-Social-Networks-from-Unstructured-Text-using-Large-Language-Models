-Targeting-
-Experiment no.01:transformation for J23100 and P0440
-Methods-
Added 10μl distilled water to wells of J23100 and P0440;distribution kit of iGEM. Then pipetted a couple of times, left it for 5min. After, all collected. NovaBlue T1R used as copetentcell, not ECOS-competent cell.
-Protocol-
1. Melt NovaBlue T1R on the ice.
2. Add 2μl plasumid to NovaBlue T1R, and incubate on the ice for 30 min.
3. Heatshock at 42℃, 30 sec.
4. Incubate on the ice for 2 min.
5. Spread 20-250μl on the plate.
6. Incubate at 37℃ for 12-14 hours.
-Results-
E.coli transformed for J23100 and P0440 have been incubating.
-Next experiment-
Check the growth of E.coli transformed for J23100 and P0440.(Shimada 1000-) Make LB medium for preculture.(Shimada & Ichikawa 1500-) Preculture E.coli transformed for J23100 and P0440.(Shimada & Ichikawa 2100-)
Plasmid solution of J23100 and P0440 are keeping in microfuge tubes and in freezer in Cell-biochemistory lab.
Seven plates of LB medium (Amp 50μg/ml)(didn't use) are keeping in cooling room in Biological macinery room.
-Visualization-
1. Electrophoresis
Run ori/GFP/RFP digested yesterday.
ori/GFP/RFP
×10buffer：about 3μl
marker: 5μl
Run for about 25min. ori/GFP were cheked bands thus cut gel and refining.
2. Refining
ori: gel 0.093g, QB 279μl
GFP: gel 0.104g, QB 312μl
Left them at 50 deg C for 10 min.
Centrifuged at room tempurature, 13000prm 1 min.
Add 500μl QB.
Centrifuged at room tempurature, 13000prm 1 min.
Add 750μl PE buffer.
Centrifuged at room tempurature, 13000prm 1 min.
Centrifuged at room tempurature, 13000prm 1 min.
Moved calumm to 1.5ml tube.
Add 30μl EB buffer and left it for 1 min.
Centrifuged at room tempurature, 13000prm 1 min.
3. Measurement of concentration of DNA
oriT:10.7 ng/μl
GFP:10.3 ng/μl
Check again to electrophorese because result of absorbance was not good.
4. Electrophoresis
Electrophoresed each 3μl ori/GFP at ×10buffer.
ori made clearly bands and GFP made dimly bands. Thus ligate at ori:GFP = 1:2.
5. Ligation
ori:3μl
GFP:6μl
T4：1μl
×10：2μl
BW:8μl
ori:3μl
T4：1μl
×10：2μl
BW:14μl
Make these two types.
Leave them at 16 deg C for a day. Transform on 5th Aug.
