-Speeding Up-
Colony PCR of HNS(wt)+I20260. Confirmed amplifing DNA but length of fragment was incorrect.
Electrophoresis of digested HNS(wt)(XbaI+SpeI),I20260(BlnⅠ).Concentration of both HNS(wt)(XbaI+SpeI) and I20260(BlnⅠ) was low.
Preculture(pSB1C3)
-Targeting-
-Colony PCR
Did colony PCR for J23100-P0440.
Did not show bands.
-Ligation
Ligated for J23100-K317037 and J23100-P0440.
