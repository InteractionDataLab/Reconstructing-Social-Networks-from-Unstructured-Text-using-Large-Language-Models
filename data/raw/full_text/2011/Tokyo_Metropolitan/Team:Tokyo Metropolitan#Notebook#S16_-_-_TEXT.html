@Killer＋Target
no.1J23100-K317037-K283030 / VF
could read 500 base which contain vector and the first half of J23100 and K317037, but not bond to no.2
no.2 J23100-K317037-K283030 / VR
could read 500 base which contain vector and the latter half of K283030,
but could not bond to no.1, deficiene 50 base from terminator codon of CheZ in K283030 (also terminator codon).
no.3 P0140 / VF
no.4 P0140 / VR
could not find both of the sequence
@Visual
no.5 OriT_GFP_OriT_1 / VF
could read about 350 base and confirmate vector and part of OriT for 60 base
no.6 OriT_GFP_OriT_1 / GFP
no.7 OriT_GFP_OriT_1 / VR
could read about 650 base from no.6 and about 350 base from no.7,
and bond each sequence to one
no.8 OriT_GFP_OriT_2 / VF
could read about 350 base and confirmate vector and part of OriT for 60 base
no.9 OriT_GFP_OriT_2 / GFP
could read about 600 base, but that is just sequence of GFP
no.10 OriT_GFP_OriT_2 / VR
could read 300 base, but not agree with OriT_GFP_OriT
no.11 OriT_GFP_OriT_3 / VF
could read 250 base which contain OriT for 60 base and vector for other sequence
no.12 OriT_GFP_OriT_3 / GFP
could not read sequence
no.13 OriT_GFP_OriT_3 / VR
could read about 300 base and find sequence of OriT
no.14 OriT_GFP_OriT_4 / VF
could read 200 base and confirmated vector and the first half of OriT
no.15 OriT_GFP_OriT_4 / GFP
could read about 600 base, but that is just sequence of GFP
no.16 OriT_GFP_OriT_4 / VR
could read about 300 base and confirmated the latter half of OriT
@summary
Targeting
succeed in ligation, but deficiene 50 base from terminator codon of CheZ in K28303.
I guessed there is not His-tag.
could not read sequence of P0140.
decrease tenpate concentration and sequencing again
Visual
4 sumples of OriT-GFP-OriT was turned out wrong.
1 and 4 were OriT-GFP.
2 was unknown.
3 was OriT only, which is self ligation.
