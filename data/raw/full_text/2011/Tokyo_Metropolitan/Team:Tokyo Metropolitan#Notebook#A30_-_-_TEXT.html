-Speeding Up-
Amplified HNS(wt),I20260 with PCR and purified these PCR products.
-Visualization-
Plasmid extraction and purification to get J23100・I714051,but there was enough plasmid.
@plasmid extraction OriTr
@DNA refine OriTr
@DNA densitometry
@restriction emzyme(EcoRⅠ and SpeⅠ, ScoRⅠ and XbaⅠ) OriTr，OriTr+GFP
-Targeting-
-DNA refining
P0440
no.1 + no.3 143

K317037xba+pst
after digested, incubated for 5 hours at 37 deg C.
-Electrophoresis
Results
Only had cut K317037
-Gel extraction
Gel extracted for K317037, then DNA refined
-Mesurement of concentration
J23100 -> 90
