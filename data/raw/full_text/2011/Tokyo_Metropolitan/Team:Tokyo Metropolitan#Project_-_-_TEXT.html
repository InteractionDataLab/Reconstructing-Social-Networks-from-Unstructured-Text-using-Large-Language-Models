Project "BeE.coli"
We propose the project "BeE.coli" as a micro injection system.BeE.coli has the abilities to move fast and target pathogens concentrated area.Getting close to pathogens, it sends the killer gene to them with conjugation. Then pathogens will be killed.
Speeding Up Device makes E.coli to move in higher speed than usual. E.coli have HNS protein gene in their genome. HNS is an Escherichia coli nucleoid protein known only to function as a modulator of gene expression. Gina M. Donato said that specific single amino acid substitutions in H-NS caused an approximately 50% increase in flagellum rotational speed. So we have E.coli to express HNS mutant T108I gene with plasmid.
⇒Click to see more description. Targeting Device gives new chemotaxis to E.coli. With this device, BeE.coli go for the target bacteria concentrated area. It is constructed to make chassis move in straight line when it receives a kind of chemicals. If the target bacteria produces a specific chemical substance, you can make chassis to swim for target bacteria by putting a appropriate promoter into this device.

When bee attack enemy, they sting needle and inject toxin. In Japan, the most cause of death from animal is attacted from bee (especially wasp).Bee is awful animal but taking a hint from it, we propose new system for killing bacteria using conjugation.

In addition, we propose a new assay of killing with conjugation.
