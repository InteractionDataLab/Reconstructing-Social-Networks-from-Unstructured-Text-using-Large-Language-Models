Digestion,electrophoresis and gel extraction J23100,I714051.
Confirm plasmid extraction was succeeded
Concentration of DNA solution(J23100,I714051) will measure tomorrow.
@DNA refine(OriTr+GFP,OriT)
electrophoresis and gel extract restriction enzymed sample(8/31).
@ligation
considering a small quantity of refined DNA, change reagent composition.
