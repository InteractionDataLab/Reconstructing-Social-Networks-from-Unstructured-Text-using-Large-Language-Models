BBa_K543002 / HNS mutant T108I
Specific single amino acid substitutions in HNS protein caused an approximately 50% increase in flagellum rotational speed.
BBa_K543012 / plux-GFP (AHL inducible)
This device is useful for detective of AHL(3OC6HSL). Under existence of AHL, GFP is expressed.
BBa_K543015 / TetR generator (J23100-B0031-R0040-B0015)
TetR generator (J23100-B0031-R0040-B0015).
Repress expression of GFP by Anti-killing device
We confirmed whether Anti-killing Device is working or not. We transform Anti-killing Device into E.coli which have GFP generator(I13522) and observed its florescence. Figure is a result of this experiment. Left is E.coli transformed Anti-killing Device, right is control. we confirmed Anti-killing Device represseｓ GFP expression weakly.
Need more experience to get quantitative date.
BBa_K543000 / HNS protein (wild type)
This is a wild type HNS protein coding part from E.coli K12 genome. HNS is an Escherichia coli nucleoid protein known only to function as a modulator of gene expression.
BBa_K543001 / HNS wild-type protein generator
This is HNS wild-type protein generator part. Use for assay of HNS mutant T108I protein generator part.
BBa_K543003 / HNS mutant T108I protein generator
HNS mutant T108I protein generator
BBa_K543010 / AHL inducible CheZ generator
This device expresses LuxR constitutively and cheZ is expressed under existence of AHL.
BBa_K543011 / plux with LuxR generator
Expression of devices under plux is induced by AHL-LuxR complex.
BBa_K543013 / cheZ generator (AHL inducible) without promoter
cheZ generator (AHL inducible) without promoter.
BBa_K543016 / Bacteriophage Lysis Cassette S105, R, and Rz under Tet promoter (conjugative)
Bacteriophage Lysis Cassette S105（Holin), R(Endolysin), and Rz under pTet.
Using this device with tetR generator, cell lysis is repressed. But adding aTc, cell lysis is induced.
BBa_K543020 / OriTr-GFP
OriTr(BBa_J01003)+GFP(BBa_I13504).
BBa_K543030 / [I714030][J23066][I714030] (Constitutive expression)
This parts is [I714030][J23066][I714030] under Constitutive promoter J23100.
BBa_K543032 / assay system of killing by conjugation
This part assays conjugation to second round of conjugation. Especially, it is useful to assay killing device by conjugation.
