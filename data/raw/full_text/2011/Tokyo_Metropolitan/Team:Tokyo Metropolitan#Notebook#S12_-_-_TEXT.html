-Targeting-
-Electrophoresis Checked to treat restriction enzyme for J04450 and J23100-P0440. Cut only J23100-P0440.
-Plasmid extraction and DNA refining
Extracted plasmids and refined DNA for J23100-K317037, J23100-P0440, K283030 and J22005.
Results (concentration = ng/ul)
J2310-K317037 (Jack) was 60
J23100-P0440 (Jamper) was 120
K283030 (Kasuga) was 155
J22005 (Jin) was 183
-Treat restriction enzyme
Treated restriction enzyme with E and P for J04450. After, incubated at 37 deg C for 5 hours.
-Electrophoresis
Checked to treat restriction enzyme for J04450. Results was a failure.
-Treat restriction enzyme
Jack -> S and P
Jamper -> E and P
Kasuga -> X and P
Jin -> Nhe
had been incubated at 37 deg C after treat restriction enzyme with preceding enzymes.
