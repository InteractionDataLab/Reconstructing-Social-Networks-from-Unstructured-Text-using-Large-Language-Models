-Targeting-
-Plasmid extraction and DNA refining
Extracted plasmid and reined DNA of J23100, P0140 and John-K-Kennedy precultured one day ago.
Results (ng/ul)
J21300 54
P0140 55
John-K-Kennedy
I. 47
II. 46
-Digestion
Digested with P and S for J23100 and John-F-Kennedy, X and P for P0140. Then incubated at 37 deg C.
-Electrophoresis
Checked for treat restriction enzyme
Results
Succeeded to cut J23100, John-F-Kennedy and P0140.
-Gel extraction
Extracted from gel for J23100 and P0140.
Results (ng/ul)
J23100 5
P0140 4
-Ligation and Transformation
Ligated J23100 and P0140 then transformed. Incubated at 37 deg C.
-Visualization-
-Colony PCR for pSB1C3+oriTr-GFP
Did colony PCR for five colony transformed on 20th Sep.
-Electrophoresis for oriTr4,oriTr-GFP 0A,oriTr-GFP 0B
Used plasmid solution, but bands showed thin. Thus restarted from plasmid extraction.
-Pre-culture for oriTr,oriTr-GFP
-Pre-culture for oriTr-GFP-oriTr
-Colony PCR
Samples which transformed one day ago
-Digestion
Promoter: Spe and Pst
Suppressed expression system: Xba and Pst
Over night
