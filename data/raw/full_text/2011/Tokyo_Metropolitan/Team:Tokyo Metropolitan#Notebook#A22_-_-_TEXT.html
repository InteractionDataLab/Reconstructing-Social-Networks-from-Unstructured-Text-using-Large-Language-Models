to oriTr-GFP connected parts refined on 17 Aug.
Details
<Digestion>
Refered to DNA concentration mesured on 17 Aug and bands checked on 18 Aug, mixed reagents as follows. And EcoR I or pst I might were inactivation, thus made only EcoR I and pst I.
oriTr-GFP１-E
EcoR  1µl
plasmid 4µl
DW  10.75µl
10×H  1.75µl
total  17.5µl
oriTr-GFP１-P
Pst I  1µl
plasmid 4µl
DW  10.75µl
10×H  1.75µl
total  12.5µl
oriTr-GFP１-EP
EcoR I 1µl
PstⅠ  1µl
plasmid 4µl
DW  9.75µl
10×H  1.75µl
total  17.5µl
Also made same three types solution for oriTr-GFP 2.
<Electrophoresis>
According to protocol.(cf. lab notebook on 3 Aug)
Marker was 5 µl : Gene Ladder Wide 1 (borrowed from Plant hormone lab)
Results
This time made good results.
Checked a band same position (3 kb) on 18 Aug for treated with only EcoR I and only pst I, two bands (2.2 kb and 1.3 kb) for treated with EcoR I + pst I.
Therefore it was successful to ligate for oriTr-GFP. And the restriction enzyme was not inactivation.
