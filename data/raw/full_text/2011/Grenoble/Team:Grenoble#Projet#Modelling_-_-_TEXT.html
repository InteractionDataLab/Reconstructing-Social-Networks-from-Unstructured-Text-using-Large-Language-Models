Modelling
The modelling team is responsible for:
Verifying that the designed genetic circuit elicits the desired behavior in E coli. A deterministic model of the circuit has been developed in order to predict the dynamical      behavior of the circuit in the presence of a concentration gradient of IPTG and various      concentrations of Mercury or aTc (anhydrotetracycline).
Providing specifications for the quantification device (size, number of bacteria, IPTG gradient). The apparition of the red line indicating the presence and quantity of Mercury or aTc is sensitive to      fluctuations in the concentration of these molecules and IPTG. We took into account these fluctuations      in a stochastic version of the circuit model, which we have used to determine the specifications of      our device.
Table of content
In the following pages, we detail the development of the deterministic and stochastic models,       together with their dynamical analysis. Solving numerically these systems required tricky calculations,      since they evolve both in time and space. To help future teams with similar calculations, we explain      in details the algorithms that were used and provide the scripts here .      The modelling results are described in the last section.
