Overview
We created educational flyers in order to improve the acquisition of pluridisciplinary knowledge and enhance the ability to communicate between team members with different university background. Thanks to this action, we also promoted the educational character of synthetic biology and showed its interdisciplinary nature by giving a talk to a large audience at the Minatec Campus of Grenoble.
