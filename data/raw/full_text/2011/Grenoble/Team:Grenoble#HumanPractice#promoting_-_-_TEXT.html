Promoting Synthetic Biology
To promote synthetic biology and its interdisciplinary approach, our team has given a conference at the scientific polygon of Grenoble "Minatec/CEA" that was attended by more than 200 researchers and students from different specialties working in Grenoble laboratories.
During our presentation:
1. We gave general information about synthetic biology, its origin, development and about the founders of this emerging field.
2. We presented our project, highlighting its environmental aspects.
3. We spoke about our Human Practice Project focused on the communication difficulties experimented by scientists working in different fields.
4. We presented our flyers and invited people to comment it.
Then we answered questions from the audience, and finished with a discussion about the interest and contribution of our Human Practice Project for the iGEM community and for the society in general.
We had a positive feedback from the audience concerning our Human Practices project. Teachers from high school and university even proposed to use our flyers in their courses in order to explain the synthetic biology and its interdisciplinary approach.
