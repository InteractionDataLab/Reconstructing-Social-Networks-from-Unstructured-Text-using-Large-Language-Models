They support us
Here you will find a brief description of institute, laboratory or company that supports us during our iGEM adventure.
Université Joseph Fourier
Université Joseph Fourier (UJF) is one of Europe's leading universities. It offers its students high-quality education, providing them with a passport to the professional world. UJF has acquired this international status through the quality of its teaching and the excellence of its research, much of which takes place in collaboration with major international and national organisations.
Grenoble INP
The Grenoble Institute of Technology is one of Europe's leading technology universities, at the heart of innovation from more than a century. It is involved in major development projects such as Minatec, or the Minalogic (micro and nanotechnology and embedded software) and EnRRDIS (renewable energy) industrial clusters. With its solid combination of teaching, research and business promotion, Grenoble Institute of Technology plays a key role in making Grenoble one of the most attractive scientific and industrial locations worldwide.
Fondation partenaire de Grenoble INP
The Grenoble Institute of Technology's partner foundation was created to develop the international competitivity of GIT. For that purpose, the foundation collect money with his partners and support industrial projects and start up creation. With his industrial contacts, the foundation gives us a hand to contact enterprises for sponsoring.
Dominique Dutscher
Dominique Dutscher distributes laboratories products of the well known brands of Sorenson BioScience, BD-Falcon, Grant and   Microflex to name just a few. They are much better known throughout Europe as Dutscher scientific
Grenoble
Grenoble is the capital of the French Alps. Grenoble is famous for its great ski resorts: Alpes d'Huez, Les Deux Alpes, but also for its ice hockey team: "Les Brûleurs de Loups" . Grenoble is also one of the largest French university towns. The city of Grenoble encourages and supports all the projects of his students and follows us in our iGEM adventure.
La Métro
The urban community "Grenoble Alpes Métropole", commonly called "La Métro", is located in the center of an half million inhabitants urban area. Second metropolis of the Rhône-Alpes region after Lyon, "La Métro" combines 27 communes around a single objective: to improve the daily lives of its 400,000 inhabitants. "La Métro" brings together the energies of its member municipalities to develop major projects, conduct political activities and develop the territory.
Minatec
MINATEC has created a powerful collaborative work environment that attracts leading international-caliber scientists in the fields of optronics, biotechnologies, components, circuit design, and motion sensing by bringing professionals together to work shoulder to shoulder in project mode, pooling know-how, and providing shared resources like open technology platforms
CIME Nanotech
The CIME Nanotech facility is a university training and research center in Grenoble, devoted to all aspects of micro- and nanotechnologies and their applications in microelectronics, energy production and biotechnologies. Organized by Grenoble Universities, the CIME is located in MINATEC. During the summer, the team used the biotechnology facility for meetings, numerical simulations and biological experiments.
Fondation Nanoscience
MINATEC has created a powerful collaborative work environment that attracts leading international-caliber scientists in the fields of optronics, biotechnologies, components, circuit design, and motion sensing by bringing professionals together to work shoulder to shoulder in project mode, pooling know-how, and providing shared resources like open technology platforms
CEA
The CEA is the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives). It is a public body established in October 1945 by General de Gaulle. A leader in research, development and innovation, the CEA mission statement has two main objectives : To become the leading technological research organization in Europe and to ensure that the nuclear deterrent remains effective in the future.
CEA organizations which support our project are:
- « CEA- Direction des Sciences du vivant »
- « CEA- Direction des Sciences de la Matière »
- « CEA-Direction de la Recherche Technologique »
- Programme Transversal Nanotoxicologie
- Programme Transversal Technologies pour la Santé
- Programme transversal Nanosciences
CNRS
The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (National Center for Scientific Research) is a government-funded research organization, under the administrative authority of France's Ministry of Research. CNRS encourages collaboration between specialists from different disciplines in particular with the university thus opening up new fields of enquiry to meet social and economic needs. CNRS has developed interdisciplinary programs which bring together various CNRS departments as well as other research institutions and industry.
IXXI
What is IXXI?
IXXI is not a lab, but a light structure that favors interdisciplinary research to model complex sytems such as biological or social systems, technological networks…
IXXI uses four steps to help creating interdisciplinary teams :
Animation of the community through workshops, seminar, IXXI-days to promote discussions between disciplines
Support emergent projects : two calls per year (spring – falls). This is an easy (but small) financing to support emergent projects/events without disciplinary barriers
Hosting researchers that are at the heart of the community through their scientific fields. Presently, we host D-NET team from Computer Science Lab at ENS de Lyon, who focuses on the dynamics of social and medical networks, members of the European project DYNANETS and the COSMO start-up (links to be added).
Teaching : IXXI has created a Master (2nd year) on “modeling of complex systems”, which is a common option for students in Masters of mathematics, computer science, physics and biology.
INRIA
The Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique (The National Institute for Research in Computer and Control) is a public organization, which is focusing on communication and information sciences and technologies.
ARKEMA
Arkema is the first French chemist and is established in about 30 industrial sites and research and development centres. Its activity domain is based on three segments:
Industrial Chemicals
Vinyl Products
Performance Products
Agence de l'eau
Created in 1964, this agence has for missions to contribute to improve water control, to fight pollution and to protect aqueous environments.
Embassy of France
Actually, the Embassy of France in the USA is headed by François Delattre. It is based at Washington DC. and is the largest French diplomatic mission in the world.
