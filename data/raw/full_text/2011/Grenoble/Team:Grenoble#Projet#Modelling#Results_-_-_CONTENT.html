						At early stage, the goal of the modelling team was to confirm the behaviour of the whole circuit.
						We divided the the network into two main models, Toggle switch and Quorum Sensing. Very early
						the modelling results seemed promising and we could rapidly infer that our Toggle Switch design 
						would be effective. Indeed, with the models described in chapter 3, we can see the behaviour of 
						our bacteria on the plate. On the plate, one whole region features bacteria in the LacI way and
						the rest of the plate features bacteria in the TetR way.
			    </P><P>
						The following simulation was realized for an IPTG gradient of $1x10^{-6} M$ to $1x10^{-2} M$ and
						an aTc concentration of $5x10^{-6} M$. The first graph present the logarithmic IPTG gradient in 
						green and the homogeneous concentration of aTc in red. The second represent the concentration 
						of both repressor on the plate.
			    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> Observation of the switch on the plate for an aTc concentration of $5x10^{-6}$</DIV></CENTER><P>
						The first thing we could observe on this figure is that the switch doesn't appears at the equality
						of the concentration of aTc and IPTG but for an IPTG concentration of $1.5x10^{-4} M$. This is due
						to the value of the parameters in the ODE system presented previously. In fact, the dissociation
						constant of respective repressor and their inhibitor are not the same.
			    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 2:</STRONG> Observation of the switch on the plate for a higher aTc concentration of $5x10{-5}$</DIV></CENTER><P>
						On the previous two figures, X axis represents physical points on the plate, form left to right of the plate.
						In each of these points the only difference is the IPTG concentration, as we will apply on our plate an IPTG 
						gradient. The interface between the two regions depends on [aTc]. Higher aTc concentration will move the 
						interface to the right edge of the plate as in figure. We therefore demonstrated that the Toggle switch
						behaviour was the one we wanted for our application.
			    </P><P>
						With this model, we also demonstrated that the presence of degradation tags were necessary to get the appropriate 
						behaviour. If the degradation rate of the LacI and TetR proteins were too long (typical half-time of 10 hours) 
						the concentrations in each protein would be too high and the switching in one way or another would be way too 
						long for our application. As a result we decided to use only LVA tagged LacI and TetR genes which impose their
						half-life time of 10 minutes.

					Our models for Quorum Sensing allowed us to simulate the behaviour of our whole system,
					confirm our expectations and finally have a visual representation of our entire device.
				</P><P>
					In a first step, we observed the distribution of the protein acting in the quorum sensing system
					and the concentration of internal and external quorum sensing. The objective is to show that coupling
					toggle switch and quorum sensing modelling works.
				</P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 3:</STRONG> Observation of the Quorum sensing molecule distribution on the plate</DIV></CENTER><P>
					On the first graph of this figure we see(in green) the cinI concentration (which follows the same equation as lacI)
					and (in red) the cinR concentration (which follows approximately the same equation as tetR). If cinR concentration is
					not as high as cinI concentration, it's because in cinR equation we needed to take into account the complexation of
					cinR with the quorum sensing molecule as a disparition term.
			    </P><P>
					Moreover, the two other curve in the first figure show the concentration of the quorum sensing molecule inside
					and outside the cells. And we see that, because of the diffusion of the quorum sensing molecule in the medium
					(third graph), the internal concentration of quorum sensing is not equal to zero where cinI is absent. Which
					indicate that quorum sensing well diffused in the medium and was caught by receiving bacterias.</P><P>
					In the following graphs we show the complexation of cinR with the quorum sensing molecule.
			    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 4:</STRONG> Observation of the Quorum sensing complexation with cinR receptor</DIV></CENTER><P>
					On the first graph of this figure, intern quorum sensing concentration (in green) and cinR concentration (in red) are
					plotted. We can well see that there is an area on the plate where cinR concentration and intern quorum sensing concentration
					are both not equal to zero. This is predicting that a complexation between both of them could happen.
					That's what it's shown is the second graph of this figure, the concentration of the cinR/Quorum Sensing complex in the
					bacterias.
			    </P><P>
					With the two previous figures, we can confirm that the quorum sensing is diffusing on the right side of the plate.
					This quorum sensing	should be caught by the receiving bacteria. This would produce lycopene and activate a diffused
					coloration on the plate.
			    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 5:</STRONG> Observation of the red stripe on the plate</DIV></CENTER><P><STRONG>
						With modelling we show that the system should work as expected. But we also hightlighted a problem: the diffusion
						of the quorum sensing which is decreasing the accuracy of the measure. To fixe this problem, we needed to
						<A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Grenoble/Projet/Results/Quorum#Simulation">optimize our device</A></STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class="blocbackground" id="Stability"><H2>Stability Studies of the Toggle Switch</H2><H3>Nullclines studies</H3><P>

					Isocline study is a classical study which implies a research of stationnary point in a system. These stationnary

					After manipulation with these reduced parameters, we get this following equations:

				$[TetR]_{r} = \frac{K}{1 +  ([LacI]_{r})^\beta}$     (1)
				$[LacI]_{r} = \frac{K_{prime}}{1 +  ([TetR]_{r})^\gamma}$      (2)</CENTER><P>
					From this equation we could see that, if $[LacI]_r$ &gt;&gt; 1, $[TetR]_r = 0$  and $[LacI]_r \approx K_{prime}$. 
					In the other case if $[TetR]_r$ &gt;&gt; 1, $[LacI]_r = 0$  and $[TetR]_r \approx K$

				    On this figure, the red lines represent the solution of the equation (1) and the green line the solution of (2).
				    This figure was realized with $[aTc] = 5x10^{-6} M$ and $[IPTG] = 1.55x10^{-4} M$. These parameters reflect the

				    Three stationary points emerge from this graph. These are the three points of intersection of two curves and represent
				    the steady state of the system.
				    However, there is one of the three points which is an unstable steady state: the point 2. It represents the point when
				    both relative concentration are equal. In a Toggle Switch, it's impossible to have concentration of both repressors
				    equal because one repressed the other. So one of these should take the avantage on the other.

					  The goal of the hysteresis study is to examine the switch conditions when the toggle switch is already locked
					  in a predefined pathway. In our mathematical study, we blocked the system in the lacI pathway with different
					  preliminary aTc concentrations. Then the amount of IPTG was increased until the system switched. Then, we 
					  decreased IPTG concentration to see when the system switched back to the initial state. The blue curve shows
					  the evolution of TetR concentration when IPTG concentration grows. The red curve shows the evolution of TetR
					  concentration when IPTG concentration decreases.
				  </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 12:</STRONG> Hysteresis curve for $[aTc] = 1x10^{-6} M$</DIV></CENTER><P>
					  To quantitatively exploit these curves we determined at which IPTG concentration the system switched.
					  On this curve, we can get the switch up concentration: ~ $1x10^{-2} M$ of IPTG and the switch back concentration
					  ~ $3x10^{-5} M$.
				  </P><P>
					  The switch back concentration is very similar to the dissociation constant between lacI and IPTG 
					  (which is $2.96x10^{-5} M$). It means that, when there is not enough IPTG in the bacteria, the IPTG-lacI 
					  complexe is faster degraded than produced. So the repression is no longer effective.
				  </P><P>
					  The following curves show different hysteresis for growing aTc concentrations:
				  </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 13:</STRONG>
							Hysteresis for $[aTc] = 1x10^{-9} M$

							</DIV></CENTER><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 15:</STRONG>
				  Hysteresis curve for $[aTc] = 1x10^{-7} M$
				  </DIV></CENTER><P>
					  The two first curves (for $[aTc] = 1x10^{-9} M$ and $[aTc] = 1x10^{-8} M$) show that the switch up and switch 
					  back concentrations are the same. This concentration is ~ $3x10^{-5} M$, the dissociation constant between lacI and IPTG.
					  The last curve (for $[aTc] = 1x10^{-7} M$) shows that the switch back concentration stay the same. But the switch up
					  concentration is higher. In fact, for aTc concentration superior to  $1x10^{-7} M$, the switch up concentration 
					  is growing with aTc concentration.
				  </P><P>
					  The concentration of aTc $1x10^{-7} M$ appears to be the limit of sensibility to the toggle switch. 
					  This concentration represents the dissociation constant of aTc to TetR repressor.
				  </P><P><STRONG>
					  Hysteresis permits to determined the inferior limit of quantification of our device: $1x10^{-7} M$ of aTc, 
					  which is the dissociation constant between aTc and TetR.
				  </STRONG></P><H3>Mathematical calibration of the system</H3><P>
					With the model we developed, you have to run a simulation if you want to know for a certain IPTG concentration
					what is the aTc concentration making the system switched. Simulation could take a lot of time and it's not the best way
					to calculate the aTc concentration.
					So, we tried to developed an equation capable of giving the same result as the simulation but much faster.					
				</P><P>
					The best solution would have been used the ODE system of the toggle switch and apply limited development on this system
					to get the equation we were looking for. But when the 2 equations are coupled it's more difficult. So we tried an other way
					to get this equation.
				</P><P>
					We also used the ODE system of the toggle system. From this system, we made the following hypothesis:
					<OL><LI>We are in a steady state: both of the equation are equal to zero</LI><LI>The synthesis rate of both promoters and the degradation terms of both repressors are the same</LI><LI>The cooperativity of repression number ($\beta$ and $\gamma$) are approximately equal and in 
						the steady state [lacI] and [tetR] are the same</LI></OL>
					Using these hypothesis we get the following development:
				</P><CENTER>
					$		      
					\frac{d[TetR]}{dt} = \frac{k_{pLac}.[pLac]_{tot}}{1 +  (\frac{[lacI]}{K_{pLac} + \frac{K_{pLac}.[IPTG]}{K_{lacI-IPTG}}.})^\beta} - \delta_{TetR}.[TetR] = 0$
					
					$\frac{d[lacI]}{dt} = \frac{k_{pTet}.[pTet]_{tot}}{1 +  (\frac{[tetR]}{K_{pTet} + \frac{K_{pTet}.[aTc]}{K_{TetR-aTc}}.})^\gamma} - \delta_{lacI}.[lacI] = 0$
				</CENTER><P>
					By applying the first hypothesis we get:
				</P><CENTER>
					$		      
					\frac{k_{pTet}.[pTet]_{tot}}{1 +  (\frac{[tetR]}{K_{pTet} + \frac{K_{pTet}.[aTc]}{K_{TetR-aTc}}.})^\gamma} - \delta_{lacI}.[lacI] = \frac{k_{pLac}.[pLac]_{tot}}{1 +  (\frac{[lacI]}{K_{pLac} + \frac{K_{pLac}.[IPTG]}{K_{lacI-IPTG}}.})^\beta} - \delta_{TetR}.[TetR]$
				</CENTER><P>
					By applying the second hypothesis we get:
				</P><CENTER>
					$		      
					\frac{1}{1 +  (\frac{[tetR]}{K_{pTet} + \frac{K_{pTet}.[aTc]}{K_{TetR-aTc}}.})^\gamma} = \frac{1}{1 +  (\frac{[lacI]}{K_{pLac} + \frac{K_{pLac}.[IPTG]}{K_{lacI-IPTG}}.})^\beta}$
				</CENTER><P>
					Which become:
				</P><CENTER>
					$		      
					(\frac{[tetR]}{K_{pTet} + \frac{K_{pTet}.[aTc]}{K_{TetR-aTc}}.})^\gamma =(\frac{[lacI]}{K_{pLac} + \frac{K_{pLac}.[IPTG]}{K_{lacI-IPTG}}.})^\beta$
				</CENTER><P>
					And finally by applying the third hypothesis, we get the following equation
				</P><CENTER>
					$		      
					[aTc] = K_{tetR-aTc}(\frac{K_{pLac}}{K_{pTet}} (1 + \frac{[IPTG]}{K_{lacI-IPTG}})$
				</CENTER><P>
					We finally get an equation depending on parameters of the system and the IPTG concentration.
					To test this equation, we compare aTc concentration obtained with simulation and with the equation.

				  Curves of the means of TetR (red) and LacI (blue) variables over a normalised IPTG gradient

					  We can see on this figure that the interface between the LacI area of the plate and the TetR area is important.
					  Its width will of course depend on the setting of the IPTG gradient ($\Delta IPTG$) between the channels 
					  on the plate. We draw the curve corresponding to $E(LacI \times TetR)$ :
				  </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 17:</STRONG>
				  Curve of the mean of $LacI \times TetR$(green)
				  </DIV></CENTER><P>
					  The width of the bell-shaped green curve will set the $\Delta IPTG$ between each well. One would understand 
					  that a proper IPTG step will be smaller than the width of this curve. If it were bigger than this width 
					  there would be a chance that no channel turns red.
				  </P><P>
					  On the other hand, if the IPTG step between channel was too small, there would be too many channels 
					  turning red without any way to know which one is the actual center of the interface.
				  </P><P>
					  Here we decided to set the smallest $\Delta IPTG$ so that a maximum of 3 channels could possibly be in the top
					  $10\%$ of the bell-shaped $E(LacI \times TetR)$ curve. We get the IPTG resolution range for this particular point:
					  between $6x10^{-3} M$ and $3.4x10^{-6} M$. These results are of course simple estimations and need more experimental validations
					  in order to get a precise knowledge of the levels of coloration, for example.
				  </P><P>
					  Another important aspect of the sensor was its Standard Error of Measure. We needed to know the variance of 
					  $LacI \times TetR$.
				  </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 18:</STRONG>
				  Estimated standard deviation of the $LacI \times TetR$ variable
				  </DIV></CENTER><P>
					  $Var(LacI \times TetR) $ was computed on all different points on the plate and final result
					  was not surprisingly higher at the interface. The maximal estimated value of standard deviation in the interface 
					  is here $1.9x10^{4}$ $(proteins^{2}/cell)^{2}$.
				  </P><P>
					  Knowing the number of bacteria we will put in the channels of the plate, we will then know the precision
					  of the sensor. The $LacI \times TetR$ variable is a sum of all cells' proteins over the channel. Which
					  makes it a sum of independant random variables ( $LacI_i \times TetR_i $ and $LacI_j \times TetR_j $ 
					  independant for $i \neq j$).
				  </P><P>
					  The precision can therefore be calculated with the Central Limit theorem :
				  </P><CENTER>
					$precision_{68\%} = \frac{\sigma_{LacI \times TetR_{cell}}}{\mu_{LacI \times TetR_{cell}}\sqrt{n_{cells}}}$</CENTER><P>
					  For example, if we want to be sure that $68\%$ of the bacteria will be within +/- $10\%$ around the mean of 
					  the channel, we can therefore state that 9025 bacteria are needed in the channels at least. Knowing that
					  the number of bacteria per channel will be about millions, we can be sure that the precision will be much higher.

				  In our project, we developed a translation regulation system in order to keep the system OFF until the pollutant is added.
				  With modelling, we show that this system is really important and without it, the measure is really disturbed.
			  </P><P>
				  In all of our simulation, we considered the initial concentrations of both repressors equal to zero. This will be the case
				  with the regulation system. Without this system, the initial concentrations of the repressors are higher. In the following
				  figure, we performed a simulation for an aTc concentration of $1.10^{-6}$ with initial concentrations equal to zero and
				  one with initial concentrations equal to $5\%$ of the concentrations in the steady state of the previous simulation.
			  </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 19:</STRONG>
			  Observation of the interface when the regulation system works and when it doesn't for an aTc concentration of $1x10^{-6}$.
			  </DIV></CENTER><P><STRONG>
				  When the regulation system doesn't work, the interface is not at the place it supposed to be. Because we can't have
				  measures of the initial concentration of both repressors, to well predict where the interface will appear, we need to control
				  these concentrations. That's why we developed the translation regulation system.
