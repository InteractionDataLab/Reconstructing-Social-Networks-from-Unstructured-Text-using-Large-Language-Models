Overview
We created educational flyers in order to highlight the complementarity between experimental and theorical approaches in synthetic biology. Our overall aim therefore is to improve the acquisition of pluridisciplinary knowledge and enhance the ability to communicate between team members. We also promote synthetic biology and its interdisciplinary nature by giving a conference at the Scientific Polygon of Grenoble.
