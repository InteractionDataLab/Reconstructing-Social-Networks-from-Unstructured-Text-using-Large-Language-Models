Genetic Network
we design the following circuit, based on Gardner and al. Gardner's [1] work and balagadd and al. on Predator–Prey ecosystem [2] .
It can be divided into four parts: the Toggle Switch, the Quorum Sensing, the Coloration and the post-transcriptional regulation. (Coloration is included in Quorum Sensing page)
Table of content
In the following pages, you can find the explanation about the differents sub-parts of our genetic network. Moreover we explane to you the importance of both to our project.
For an introduction to the genetic circuit, see our tutorials in the human practice      section or download them here :
