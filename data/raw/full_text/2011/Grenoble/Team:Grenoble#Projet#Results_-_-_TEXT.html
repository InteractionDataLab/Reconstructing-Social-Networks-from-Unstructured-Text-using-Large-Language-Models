We describe here the modeling and experimental results obtained for each network module,       in order to validate our model and optimize the device: the toggle switch, the quorum sensing       and the translational regulation system RsmA.
Validation of the genetic network
The essential role of rmsA regulation system
Device optimization and specifications
In each part, we tried to speak about both experiment and modelling, in order to validate our model and optimized       by simulation the device.
Validation of the network
Toggle Switch and Quorum sensing behavior
Validation of the model
Dynamic study of the stability
The essential role of rsmA regulation system
Why do we need this system ?
