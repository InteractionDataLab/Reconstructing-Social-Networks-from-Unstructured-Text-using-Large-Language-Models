		First  of our modelling and experiments was to validate the work of our genetic network. Primary validate by
		modelling, the genetic network was validate with the construction of a toggle switch test.
	</P></DIV><DIV class="blocbackground" id="TS_QS"><H2>Toggle switch and quorum sensing behavior</H2><H3>The toggle switch behavior</H3><P>
							The first goal of the modelling team was to verify that the genetic circuit as conceived had the desired dynamical behavior. We divided the network into two modules, the Toggle switch and the Quorum Sensing modules, which we modeled separately to facilitate their modeling and dynamical analysis. 

Very early, the modelling of these modules gave promising results and we could rapidly conclude that our Toggle Switch system would be functional. Hence, with the models described in the <A href="http://2011..org/Team:Grenoble/Projet/Modelling/Deterministic">deterministic modelling approach</A>, we predicted the behaviour of our bacteria on the plate. Two regions could be distinguished on the plate: one region with bacteria in a state characterized by a high LacI concentration, while bacteria in the other region contain high TetR levels.
				    </P><P>
We show below a typical simulation result obtained with an IPTG gradient of $1.10^{−6} M$ to $1.10^{−2} M$ and an aTc concentration of $5.10{−6} M$. The X axis represents physical points on the plate, from the right side to the left side of the plate. Each point differs by the IPTG concentration.
							The second represent the concentration 
							of both repressor on the plate.
				    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 1:</STRONG> Prediction of the switch on the plate for an aTc concentration of $5.10^{−6} M$. Upper panel:
the logarithmic IPTG gradient is shown in green, the homogeneous aTc concentration, in red. Lower
panel: LacI and TetR repressor concentrations are shown in blue and red, respectively.</DIV></CENTER><P>
As can be seen in Figure 1, the switch is not observed in the area where the aTc and IPTG
concentrations are equal, but for an IPTG concentration of $1,5.10^{−4} M$. This result is due to the
values chosen for the parameters in the ODE system: the dissociation
constants of the repressors and their respective inhibitors are not the same. This is not affect how the system works.
It just means that the aTc concentration can't be deduced directly from the IPTG concentration. We need to construct a law
which gives us the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Grenoble/Projet/Results/Device#Calibration">aTc concentration depending on IPTG concentration</A>.	
				    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 2:</STRONG> Observation of the switch on the plate for a higher aTc concentration  ($5.10^{-5} M$)</DIV></CENTER><P>
The results shown in Figure 1 and 2 show that, as expected, the boundary between the two different
regions on the plate is shifted depending on the aTc concentration. For instance, a higher aTc
concentration moves the interface to the right side of the plate as in Figure 2. We have therefore
demonstrated that the Toggle switch behaviour is the one expected for our application.					
				    </P><P>
In addition, the modelling results show that the presence of degradation tags is necessary to get the
appropriate behaviour. If the degradation rates of LacI and TetR repressors were too long (even for
the typical half life of about 10 hours), the concentration of each of these proteins would be too high
and the switching between states would be way too long for our application. As a result we decided
to only use LVA-tagged lacI and tetR genes, which reduce their half-life time to 10 minutes.
				    </P><P><STRONG>
In summary:

Demonstration that the Toggle Switch has the expected behaviour

Use only unstable (LVA-tagged) lacI and tetR genes
							
				    </STRONG></P><DIV id="QS"><H3>Quorum Sensing</H3></DIV><P>
Our models for the Quorum Sensing module were used to simulate the whole system functioning.
This allowed us to verify the system has the expected behavior and to eventually obtain a visual
representation of the entire device.
					</P><P>
In a first , we observed the distribution of the protein involved in the quorum sensing system and the concentration of internal and external quorum sensing molecule (figure 3). The objective is to show that coupling toggle switch and quorum sensing modelling works well.
					</P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 3:</STRONG> Predicted distribution of the Quorum sensing molecules on the plate. CinI and CinR concentrations are shown in green and red, respectively.</DIV></CENTER><P>
The upper panel in Fig. 3 shows the predicted CinI and CinR concentrations (the evolution of the
latter follows approximately the same equation as the TetR concentration). The fact that CinR
concentration is not as high as CinI concentration is due to the modelling: in the CinR equation,
we needed to take into account the complexation of CinR with the quorum sensing molecule as a
consumption term.
                                    </P><P>
The other curves in the two lower panels show the intra- and extracellular concentrations of the
quorum sensing molecules. We see that, due to the diffusion of quorum sensing molecules in the
medium (third panel), the internal concentration of quorum sensing is not equal to zero when CinI is
absent. This indicates that the quorum sensing molecules diffused correctly in the medium and were
imported by receiving bacteria.
				    
				    </P><P>
The following graphs show the complexation of CinR with the quorum sensing molecule.
				    </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 4:</STRONG> Predicted complexation of the Quorum sensing molecule with the CinR receptor. The concentrations of the quorum sensing molecule and its receptor are shown in green and red, respectively.</DIV></CENTER><P>
The concentrations of internal quorum sensing molecules and their receptors are plotted in the
upper panel. The complexation occurs in the area of the plate where the concentrations of the two
differ from zero. The resulting complex concentration is given in the lower panel.
				    </P><P>
From the two previous figures, we confirm that quorum sensing molecules diffuse on the right side of
the plate. They should be caught by receiving bacteria, resulting in the lycopene production and the
appearance of a diffused coloration on the plate.
			           </P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 5:</STRONG> Predicted observation of the red line on the plate</DIV></CENTER><P><STRONG>
With this modelling part, we have shown that the system should work as expected. However
we have also discovered a potential problem, that the diffusion of the quorum sensing molecule
decreases the accuracy of the measure. Fixing this problem required to <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Grenoble/Projet/Results/Quorum#Simulation">optimize our device</A></STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class="blocbackground" id="Validation"><H2>Experimental validation of the model</H2><H3>Construction of the toggle switch test</H3><P>
						In order to test if our system could work experimentally, we constructed a toggle switch test based on Gardner's work <A href="#1">[1]</A>.

We first cloned RBS-GFP downstream of RBS-TetR, and Q04121 downstream of pTet. The following
gel shows that both constructions have the expected size (1 500 bp). The constructions were
confirmed by DNA sequencing.

In the last step of cloning, we cloned RBS-tetR-RBS-GFP downstream of pTet-Q04121. The size is around 3 000 bp. The following gel shows that constructions was at the expected size. In addition to this test, transformation of bacteria have grown on plate with IPTG to block them in the fluorescence way. And some of the bacteria were fluorescent. Construction was also confirmed by sequencing.

The expression of the fluorescent gene, put after the repressor TetR to measure its expression level,
could be experimentally monitored. The presence of fluorescence will indicate that the system is
in the state with a high TetR concentration while its absence of fluorescence will indicate that the
system is in the LacI state.

					   </P><P>

							We decided to compare the model with the experiments as follows:
							<UL><LI>The bacteria are first blocked in the non-fluorescent pathway (LacI).</LI><LI>Then placed in a 96-well plate with at different aTc and IPTG concentration.</LI><LI>Measure of the fluorescence during 10 hours.</LI></UL></P><P>
							The experimental and modelling results are shown in Figure. 4 and 5,respectively.
						</P><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 4:</STRONG> The bacteria were first blocked in the non-fluorescent pathway (LacI) , before they were spread
on a 96-well plate with different aTc concentrations and 1 mM of IPTG. The fluorescence signal
was measured during 10 hours. The experimental and modelling results are shown in Figure. 4 and 5,
respectively.
						</DIV></CENTER><CENTER><DIV class="legend"><STRONG>Figure 5:</STRONG>Modelling of tetR expression for two aTc concentrations: 50 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL
						</DIV></CENTER><P>

We conclude from the experimental graph that the switch occurs after 3 hours of experiment, at
an aTc concentration between 50 and 150 ng/ml: fluorescence is obtained with 50ng/mL of aTc
but not with 150ng/mL of aTc. From the modelling graph, we can see as well that TetR is produced
at 50ng/mL of aTc, but not 150ng/mL. Therefore, we predict the same switch between these two
concentrations, as in the experiment. However, we experimentally observe more fluorescence than
expected: no fluorescence should be observed for the red curve at steady state. This is due to the
high stability of the GFP protein (half life of 10 hours), which made it impossible to suppress the
fluorescence signal in a ten-hour experiment.
						</P><P>
We also did an experiment on bacteria grown in an IPTG preculture. But we did not see a switch
because IPTG blocks bacteria in the fluorescent state. Because of the half life of GFP, it was only
possible to detect a switch with bacteria grown with aTc.
						</P><P><STRONG>
To go further, it will be very interesting to put an LVA tag on GFP in order to control its degradation.
In this case we will be abble to see the switch in both case and with higher magnitude. 
We also construct this toggle with the quorum sensing gene to get the proof of concept. 
In addition to the experimental results shown above, we also constructed this Toggle Switch together
with the quorum sensing gene to get the proof of concept of our system functionality. The same
construction has also been performed with the mercury repressor in place of TetR.					</STRONG></P></DIV><DIV class="blocbackground" id="Dynamic"><H2>Stability Studies of the Toggle Switch</H2><H3>Nullclines studies</H3><P>

						    Three stationary points emerge from this graph. These are the three points of intersection of two curves and represent
