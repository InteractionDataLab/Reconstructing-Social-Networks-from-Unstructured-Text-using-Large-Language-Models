Our Project
We will work on a way to make some of the previous iGEM systems work together. We aim to build a complex logical system by assembling the basics component (already working logical gates) provided by other teams' work.   We will have to work on compatibility. And to do so, we need to design output signals that can be used as input signals. We also need to prevent the components to interfere with each other.
