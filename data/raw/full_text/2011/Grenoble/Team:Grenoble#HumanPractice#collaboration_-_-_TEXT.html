Collaboration
We have collaborated with iGEM Paris Bettencourt 2011 by sending them videos of the debate that we have organised with the participants of our test, made to evaluate the impact of our educational flyers.
During this debate our participants explained and gave their point of view about: What the synthetic biology evokes for them?
In return, their collaboration is to repeat the same test of our evaluation flyers with a large number of students in Paris.
The Quiz conditions were similar to those of the Quiz in Grenoble except that for practical reasons, we prepared a numerical answer grid that we sent to Paris team.
