Quorum Sensing Achievements
Optimization of the device
As the modelling part shows our models for Quorum Sensing allowed us to have a visual representation of        our entire device. This modelling highlighted the diffusion of the quorum sensing molecule.

Decreasing the accuracy of the measure, quorum sensing diffusion is a problem for our system. To fixe this problem,       we decided to developed a device with channel containing each of them a different IPTG concentration but        the same aTc concentration.
Figure 5: First prototype of the device
This kind of device allows us to limit the diffusion of quorum sensing at one channel. Of course the measure won't be a unique concentration, but a range of concentration.       However, the problem posed by quorum sensing diffusion would disrupt the measure more than the channel device (if there are       a sufficent number of channel and a small enough IPTG step).
