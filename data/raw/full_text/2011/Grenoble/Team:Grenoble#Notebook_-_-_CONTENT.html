	  Colonies grown only on the Petri dish containing the construction of CinI inserted into RBS plasmid.

	  1 plasmid was considered for each toggle switch way (MerR or LacI), so 2 final plasmids.
	  But those 2 plasmids will include the 2 different couples cinI/cinR and luxI/luxR. The most efficient construction will be used.

	  Coloration Generator: (4 plasmids)
	  Coloration is induced by the activation of the promoter pLux or pCin depending on which couple cinI/cinR or luxI/luxR picked. As previously, the best coloring agent hasn't been decided yet. So, 4 plasmids will be produced: 1 for pCin, 1 for pLux and both followed either by GFP or Lycopène.

	  Tests: (6 plasmids)
	  The test of the two ways (MerR and LacI) of our toggle will be achieved by replacing pLac or pMerT by a constitutive promoter. So, 4 plasmids: 2 ways of the toggle switch, 2 different couples (luxI/luxR, cinI/cinR).
	  Efficiency of both promoters will be tested separately by associating them to GFP.
	  </P><LI>Biobrick Listing</LI><P>21 Biobricks will be necessary to achieve only the toggle switch and the coloration generator:
	  - 14 Biobricks
	  - 7 plasmid backbones
	  This includes biobricks which will be used for the tests (for example for the promoters) and as intermediate constructions.
	  </P><LI>Manipulation schedule</LI><P>Steps were defined for each construction depending on the level of assembly required. For example the assembly of two existing biobricks corresponds to a first level. Whereas the assembly of two newly obtained corresponds to a 2nd our 3rd level. 
	  Each level should be achieve at the time.</P></UL><H2>Team Godlike</H2><P>Essentially worked on the models to use and how to simulate them</P><UL><LI>Models</LI><P>Toggle Switch : Worked on the equations that would modelize our system the best.
	  We now have the equations for the toggle switch and a first Matlab script that we can base our work on.

	  ODE solvers for now. Our plan for the final device is a plate with our bacteria. We will have to adapt our code for
	  this particular device</P></UL><DIV class="printfooter">
