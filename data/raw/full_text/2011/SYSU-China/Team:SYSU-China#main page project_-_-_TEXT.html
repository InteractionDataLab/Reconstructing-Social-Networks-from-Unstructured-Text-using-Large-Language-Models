Special Thanks
Visual Identity
Thanks to the promoter recAp and recNp from SOS system, our E.coli is able to sense the radiation of Cs-137 and move toward the radiant.
 
After our E.coli have reached the radiant, they will express protein TrkD, an ion channel with high affinity to Cs, to take in Cs-137.aggregation.
 
Our E.coli will express ag43 to aggregate after the absorption process. By applying antigen-antibody principle our E.coli will attach to plates we provide, which can be took out of water at last.
Our experimental diary.
See out BioBricks.
We asure that our experiments are safe.
