    We ran a workshop in our school with junior students. For more effective group discussion, we limit the participants to no more than 15 students.
    Firstly, we introduced the concept and achievements of synthetic biology. Then we talked about the Biobrick and iGEM. As we think, the workshop is not only for iGEM or synthetic biology, we also spend much time talking about problems they may meet in their future study.
