We inoculated the cheZ-GFP-pUC18 and trkD-GFP-pUC18 with 5mL LB. We use IPTG to trigger the lac promoter before both the cheZ-GFP-pUC18 and trkD-GFP-pUC18, then use fluorescence microscope to exam whether the two genes have successfully expressed.
Aug.22, 2011 Monday
Xu Yitian, Sun Weiwen, Zhao Zhilun:
We intermediatecultured 1ml strains with 100mL LB. After two hours shaking and measured the OD value of the two strains of 0.45, we separated the 100ml inocula into 4 conical flasks and induced with 3 different concentrations of IPTG(one leaved is control). After 4 hours induction, we used fluorescence microscope to exam the inocula and find out that the control group, which should not be of a dark view, have fluorescence too. That means the lac promoter can trigger the expression of its downstream genes without induction. Then we want to transfer our genes onto another plasmid, pET28a, whose promoter lied between the restriction sites of BamHI and BglII. The two enzymes are isocaudamers and the gap cut by them can be linked without inserting any sequence.
