Data For Our Favorite New Parts
1. Main Page - acid induced promoter rcfB + repressor lacR of lac operon, BBa_K609001: When the external pH value declines to 5.5, rcfB promoter will be highly upregulated. Along with that, the lacR gene, which is downstream of rcfB, will be highly transcribed. The large translation of LacR, the repressor of lac operon in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, will inhibit the use of lactose in the bacteria.
2. Main Page - human collagen type Ⅲ, BBa_K609002: The gene contains a coding region encoding 101 amino acids, a signal peptide called blpC and a His tag.
3. Main Page - A Nisin resistance gene nisI for Lactobacillus bulgaricus, BBa_K609003: This is a Nisin resistance gene nisI and the coding area has been optimized for a better function in Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
Data For Other New Parts
1. Main Page - human collagen type Ⅲ+ nisI (without promoter), BBa_K609005: It is the combination of a section of human collagen gene with the Nisin resistance gene nisI.
2. Main Page - A Nisin resistance gene nisI for Streptococcus thermophilus, BBa_K609004:  This is a Nisin resistance gene nisI and the coding area has been optimized for a better function in Streptococcus thermophilus.
3. Main Page - nisI+pH induced promoter rcfB+ repressor LacR of lac operon, BBa_K609000: The combination of BBa_K6090001 and a Nisin resistance gene nisI which could be used in food.
