Electrophoresis Gel 1, 23/08/2011.
Gel 1::  Ladder / HlyD digested (three joint wells) / HlyD non-digested / HlyA digested (three joint wells) / HlyA non-digested .
23 August 2011
Purification of digested HlyA and RBS+HlyD - secretion system
Objective: Electrophoresis for the purification of digested HlyA and RBS+HlyD.
Ladder: Bio-Rad 100bp – 10.000bp
Agarose concentration: 1%
Samples:
Ladder / HlyD digested (three joint wells) / HlyD non-digested / HlyA digested (three joint wells) / HlyA non-digested
Results:

-All the genes were purified using Fermentas kit.
Transformation
The plasmids purified yesterday were transformed using the Chemically Competent E. coli and the protocol of Chemo-transformation .
Three plates for each Construct were used, inoculated with different volumes of the transformation:
100 uL, 200 uL and the remaining volume after centrifugation and concentration of bacteria for the plasmid containing:
RBS+QseB+QseC+Terminator
RBS+TolC+Terminator
RBS+SoxR+Terminator
New digestion for our synthetic promoters and Electrophoresis in a more concentrated gel
Electrophoresis Gel 2, 23/08/2011.
Objective: Check for problems with our synthesized promoters
Agarose concentration: 1.5% stained with ethidium bromide
Samples:
L = 1Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Invitrogen)
1 = vector containing the SoxS promoter digested with EcoRI
2 = vector containing the SoxS promoter digested with PstI
3 = vector containing the SoxS promoter digested with EcoRI and PstI
Explanation of results:
Both photos are from the same gel, but the right one is in grey scale. The single digestions (conducted with only one enzyme - lanes 1 and 2) showed that we have both restriction sites in the vector, which is actually present in our synthesized insert because the vector does not have any restriction site. So, there is no mutations here. Lane three shows our released promoter (black arrow), although it is not easy to see.
So, our promoters are probably correctly inserted in the vectors, with the problem being that they are too short to be visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Since we do not need to take them off the vector to work with them (we can put our larger fragments in the vector with the promoters), as soon as we have the gene(s)+terminator constructions done we can start putting them in the linearized vectors.
Digestions recipe
HlyA:
50ul - HlyA miniprep
8ul   - milli-Q water
7ul   - 10X Buffer R
1ul   - EcoRI
4ul   - SpeI
Total = 70ul
RBS+HlyD:
32ul   - RBS+HlyD miniprep
4ul     - 10X Buffer R
0.8ul  - EcoRI
3.2ul  - SpeI
Total = 40ul
Ligations recipe
RBS+TolC - vector+terminator
9ul milli-Q water
5ul - RBS+TolC (~300ng)
3ul - vector+terminator (~100ng)
2ul  - 10X T4 Buffer
1ul  - T4 DNA Ligase
Total = 20ul
vector+terminator - RBS+SoxR
3ul     -  milli-Q water
20ul   - RBS+SoxR (~80ng)
2.5ul  - vector+terminator (~80ng)
3ul     - 10X T4 Buffer
1.5ul  - T4 DNA Ligase
TOTAL = 30ul
RBS+QseB+RBS+QseC - vector+terminator
4ul   - milli-Q water
10ul - RBS+QseB+RBS+QseC (~200ng)
3ul - vector+terminator (~100ng)
2ul  - 10X T4 Buffer
1ul  - T4 DNA Ligase
TOTAL = 20ul
Incubate all ligation reactions for 1hour at 22°C. Use 1-2ul of these ligations to do the transformation in the afternoon.
Next Tasks:
Incubate both reactions at 37°C for 3-4hours.
Electrophoresis (loading the whole digestions volume)
Purify the bands
Electrophoresis to confirm
