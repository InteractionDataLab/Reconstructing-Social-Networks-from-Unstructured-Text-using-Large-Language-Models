Electrophoresis Gel 1, 22/08/2011.
Gel 1:Terminator/Terminator/RBS+GFP/RBS+GFP/RBS+HlyD/RBS+HlyB/RBS+TolC/HlyA/RBS+SoxR/RBS+QseB+RBS+QseC .

Digestion of our synthetic genes
Objective: Cut the band of the opened vector (terminator) or cut gene (all the rest);
Ladder: 100 bp Bio-Rad
Samples:
(all digested, forgot to apply the closed vector sample in the gel) Terminator/ Terminator/ RBS+GFP/ RBS+GFP/ RBS+HlyD/ RBS+HlyB/ RBS+TolC/ HlyA/ RBS+SoxR/ RBS+QseB+RBS+QseC

All the genes were purified using Fermentas kit (25 uL elution) and quantified through electrophoresis:
Second Electrophoresis Gel, 22/08/2011.
Gel 2: Terminator/ Terminator / RBS+GFP/ RBS+GFP / RBS+HlyD/ RBS+HlyB/ RBS+TolC/ HlyA /RBS+SoxR /RBS+QseB+RBS+QseC .
Ladder: 100 bp Bio-Rad
Objective:
Quantification (volume of ladder applied 6 uL; sample: 5 uL DNA +1 uL buffer )
Samples: Terminator/ Terminator / RBS+GFP/ RBS+GFP / RBS+HlyD/ RBS+HlyB/ RBS+TolC/ HlyA /RBS+SoxR /RBS+QseB+RBS+QseC
HlyA did not appear in the gel!! Digest and purify again !!!
Nd: non digested
D: digested
Promoter testings
Third Electrophoresis Gel, 22/08/2011.
Gel 2: L = 1Kb Plus DNA Ladder Invitrogen
1 = SoxS promoter - 100ng of the synthesized construction
2 = flhDC promoter - 100ng of the synthesized construction
3 and 4 = SoxS promoter - 2ul of the miniprep
5 and 6 = Constitutive promoter - 2ul of the miniprep
7 = flhDC promoter - 2ul of the miniprep.
Objective:
Check the inserted promoters in our vectors
Agarose gel: 1.5% stained with ethidium bromide
Samples:
L = 1Kb Plus DNA Ladder Invitrogen
1 = SoxS promoter - 100ng of the synthesized construction
2 = flhDC promoter - 100ng of the synthesized construction
3 and 4 = SoxS promoter - 2ul of the miniprep
5 and 6 = Constitutive promoter - 2ul of the miniprep
7 = flhDC promoter - 2ul of the miniprep
Results and explanation
Again, we did not observe any band corresponding to the excised insert. Since the vectors in which the synthesized promoters are cloned have no restriction sites for the enzymes we used (EcoRI and PstI), and given that we are observing linearized vectors after the digestions, we can conclude that there is at least something (an insert) in the vector that is being cut. So, we have two possibilities:
(1) the amount of DNA in the excised insert is too low for visualizing in the agarose gel (which is possible in the case of very short DNA fragments);
or (2) there is a mutation in the sequence recognized by one of the restriction enzymes, possibly inserted during the synthesis process (which is very unlikely to be occurring solely in the promoter sequences).
