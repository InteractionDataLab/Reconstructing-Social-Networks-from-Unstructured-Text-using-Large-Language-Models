We aimed to stimulate students to think about being scientists, understanding how important are these themes and that they are not so far from the students! We call the DNA Workshop a &quot;self-propagating&quot; didactical method since a school teacher can easily present our Video-class to their students and after that, promote the &quot;workshop&quot;, which consists on a very small version of iGEM, where the students are stimulated to solve a problem by terms of creating a genetic system. The DNA workshop kit is very easy to build, you can see the step-by-step assembly of the kit by clicking here. 
</LI></UL></DD></DL><DL><DD><UL><LI>We applied this method in &quot;UFMG e escolas&quot; ('UFMG and Schools' in portuguese), a traditional course promoted each semester at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), in Belo Horizonte city, Brazil. In this course, sixty (60) high school students stay for one week working in Biology Institute laboratories, by creating questions and trying to answer through experiments. Then, we participated in one afternoon performing the presentation of our videoclass and promoting the DNA Workshop! The results were AMAZING! We were able to STIMULATE the students and to ATTRACT their interest for Science and Genetic Engineering. Also, they could LEARN about this field and sure, they will never forget this experience, where they created many solutions for important problems and awarded great knowledge.

The DNA Workshop was performed in a traditional high school vacation course which occurs at <A href="http://www.ufmg.br/english/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">UFMG</A> (Federal University of Minas Gerais), called UFMG and Schools (&quot;UFMG e Escolas - Educando para a Ciência&quot;). In this course, the high-school students stay in the laboratory developing their own ideas and trying to answer their own scientific questions. We had one afternoon (the &quot;DNA day&quot;) to develop with the students our method and it was completely AWESOME! You can find out the enthusiasm and interest that workshop was able to create on the students in our <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UNICAMP-EMSE_Brazil/Human_Practices/DNA_workshop#Video_Documentary_about_DNA_Workshop_application" class="external text" rel="nofollow">second video</A>, a <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UNICAMP-EMSE_Brazil/Human_Practices/DNA_workshop#Video_Documentary_about_DNA_Workshop_application" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Documentary about our results</A>!
Additionally, we used questionnaries in order to obtain general information about knowledge in genetic engineering among the high-school students from Belo Horizonte city.

The questions and results are the following:
</P><DIV align="center"><DIV align="left"><P align="justify">By analyzing these graphics we can conclude that most of the high-school students in fact have never heard about synthetic biology and genetic engineering. Additionally, the majority of students think that Educational Programs (such as our proposal) should be focused in order to increase and spread the knowledge about this field. This is a very interesting fact, Brazilian school system seems to not prioritize the contact of students with this kind of science. This is not a good point, since the contact with science early in school is very important to show to the person a possible way which he/she can choose. Many people here in Brazil will die without even hearing about genetics, and maybe if they have heard about and if someone could awake in this person the passion for science, maybe we would have more scientists. In our survey, most children which studies in schools have never heard about Genetic Engineering. We can imagine that if we get a sample of more students, this pattern would continue being observed. Nowadays these students who answered those questionnaries know what is Genetic Engineering, and maybe tomorrow they will be more well-informed and conscious citizens or great scientists, and will contribute to live better in this world. 

Then we may ask you something:
What about millions of Brazilian children in schools which have never heard about this scientific fields? And What about if some of then, when in contact with science, could become great scientists? But this will only occur if they have contact with science, if someone can show to them how beautiful is understanding nature. This is our proposal: make them know what they are able to do. They are able to do everything, whatever problem they want to solve, they can solve by means of science. 

There is an evidence in the graphics above which support the hypothesis that there are lots of students which could be (in the future) interested in synthetic biology. The majority of students said that had never heard about iGEM, and most of them, after the presentation, answered that they would be interested in participating in iGEM. We believe that this can show that the students must have a primary contact with a field to awake their interest. By disseminating this field, we could find future scientists.

This little contact with science changed her life. She discovered that she loves science and fell very good in trying to understand the nature. Then, after this contact with laboratories, scientific projects and talks, she decided to start her undergraduate studies in Biological Sciences. If she had not participated on UFMG and Schools, she probably would not participating today in iGEM.
