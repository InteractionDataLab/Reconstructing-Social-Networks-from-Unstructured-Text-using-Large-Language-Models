Louise and Nani:
Miniprep with RBS-GFP. Two good samples.
Digestion with XbaI and PstI of the two good samples.
Claire, Thibault and Juliana:
Digestion of Strong Promoter with PstI and SpeI.
Electrophoresis of digestion. We were surprised to obtain two bands, but then we realized that one was the linearized plasmid and that the other was RFP. It means we already had a marker, so we didn't need to insert GFP.
Cutting digestion band.
Nani:
Transformation of bacteria with Biofusion vector J04450.
Growth on plates.
