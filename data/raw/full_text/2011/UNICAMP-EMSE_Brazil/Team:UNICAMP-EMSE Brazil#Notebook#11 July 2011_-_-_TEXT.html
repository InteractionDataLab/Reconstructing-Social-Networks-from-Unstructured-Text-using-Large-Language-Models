11 July 2011
Louise and Marc:
Ligation RBS + GFP.
Transformation of bacteria by chemical shock.
Growth on plates.
Thibault and Claire:
Miniprep quantification - Low concentrations.
Digestion- As there was not enough sample volume, we had to join different samples.
Electrophoresis - It seemed to work! But we obtained a second weak band that we don't know how to interpret.
