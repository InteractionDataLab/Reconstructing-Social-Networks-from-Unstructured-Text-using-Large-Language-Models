Ligation:
Quantificate the plasmid using absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm.
Concentration of plasmid (μg/mL) = A260*50*dilution
Ratio 260/280 nm should be between 1,8-2,0.
Use this online tool to calculate how much insert to calculate how much insert we will need to use in the reaction ( http://www.promega.com/techserv/tools/biomath/calc06.htm ).
Or
[length of insert (kb)/ length of vector (kb)]* ng of vector  =  ng of insert for a 1:1 ratio
It´s better to use at least 100 ng of vector and a reaction ratio of 3:1 (insert:vector)
Example:
Length of insert (in kb) = 0.7
Amount of vector (in ng) = 100
Length of vector (in kb) = 5
You need 14 ng de insert for a 1:1 molar ratio
For the 3:1= 42 ng de inserto.
Ligation (protocol adapted from Fermentas)
Plasmid (~50-60ng)
Insert DNA purified (the ratio was determined according to the fragment and plasmid sizes, ranging from 1:1 to 1:4)
2μl of T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
1μl of T4 DNA Ligase
Sterile water
Final volume = 20μl
Add the reaction components to a sterile 0,2 sterile tube. Mix gently.
Keep the tubes at 22˚C for 1 hour or overnight at 4˚C.
