Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues  in terms of:
1. researcher safety,
2. public safety, or
3. environmental safety?
We use K12 strain of E.coli, and DNA  using in our laboratory is safety gene, moreover, our experiment was controlled  under P2 level room.
Therefore, we think our project is safe.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that  you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
1. did you document these issues in the Registry?
2. how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
3. How could other teams learn from your experience?
There is not BioBrick which starts a  problem for the moment.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or  review board at your institution?
1. If yes, what does your local biosafety group think   about your project?
2. If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do   you have to consider in your contry?
Yes, we have Institutional Biosafety Committee in our  university.   
We already discussed our Committe about our project. No problem
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety  issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts,  devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Since it can be experimenting safely,  for the moment, the proposal does not have.
