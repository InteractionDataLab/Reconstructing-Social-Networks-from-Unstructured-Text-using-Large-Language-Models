Welcome to KAIT Japan Wiki
We tried to overlap colony on  colony. Generally, colony and colony don’t overlap and approach each other,  because of the cell-cell communications. Bacterias also have a system, so called  quorum sensing, to control of production of signal chemicals depend on the  bacteria’s density.
We pay attention quorum sensing  system. Bacterias produce and secret autoinducer against other bacterias by  quorum sensing system, as a result of the system, bacteria senses other  bacterias. Most of Gram-negative bacterias make use of autoinducer named AHL. We  applied E. coli to our experiment and we use aiia which is catabolic enzyme to  inhibit AHL. We tried to make a recombinant bacteria to cancelled sensing of  other bacterias and expected to form the colony of bacterias on the other  bacterias.
