Back Ground
Bacteria detect the concentration of its friends,  called Quorum Sensing, and the sensing system is one of the communication tools  between microbes. It is related also to formation of biofilm and to  pathogenicity.
As the Quorum Sensing of Gram-negative bacterias,  Acyl-Homoserine Lactone
(AHL ) is released to recognize each other. 2007,  the team of Chiba University made the vacteria production of aiia to decrease  the AHL.
We considered application of the system to make a colony layer on a  colony layer by
depressing of Quorum Sensing.
Purpose
We make bacteria that have transgene of AiiA, and get  the bacteria to produce abundance of AiiA.The abundance of AiiA inhibit AHL,and  General, colony and colony don’t approach by AHL.
Our projects were done to  approach and overlap.
 
 
Word
Quorum Sensing
Quorum sensing is a system of stimulus and response  correlated to population density.
Many species of bacteria use quorum  sensing to coordinate gene expression according to the density of their local  population. In similar fashion, some social insects use quorum sensing to  determine where to nest.
AHL and AiiA
AHL is [N-] acyl-homoserine lactones.
AHL is a  small transmitter that is used in quorum sensing system autoinducer (AI) is  known as. AHL is present in many gram-negative bacteria
In low cell density,  AHL becomes low concentration, and AHL becomes high concentration in high cell  density.
At high cell densities, the AIs can accumulate to a concentration  sufficient for activation of related regulatory genes. Because the concentration  of AHL's is a key factor in determining virulence gene expression in several  pathogenic bacteria, it is possible to develop a strategy for disease control by  controlling production of AIs or eliminating AIs produced by pathogenic  bacteria.
AiiA, an enzyme that inactivates the acylhomoserine lactone  quorum-sensing signal.
Autoinducer
Autoinducers are chemical signaling molecules that are  produced and used by bacteria participating in quorum sensing.
