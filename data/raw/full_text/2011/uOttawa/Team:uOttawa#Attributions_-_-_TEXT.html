Wet lab work
The undergraduates Matt Orton, Ian Roney, Wilson Lam and Zuhair Syed constructed and submitted all BioBrick parts created by the uOttawa Team. The two graduate students on the team, Alex Power and Dan Jedrysiak, assisted with project design, integration of BioBricks into S. cerevisiae and characterization of BioBricks by flow cytometry.
Dan Jedrysiak and Alex Power also developed and tested the new BioBrick assembly protocol. All parts submitted by the uOttawa Team were constructed using this method by the undergraduates mentioned above.
Our lab technician Mila Tepliakova assisted with day to day lab work and advice.
Our instructor Dr. Mads Kaern supplied the team with all lab related resources and assisted with project design.
Design
All aspects of the project related to artistic design including poster, wiki, presentation, brochure, and logo were created by many of the undergraduate students on the team without the use of third party designers.
Fundraising
All fundraising activities were performed exclusively by members of the team.
Financial and Administrative
The financial and administrative aspects of the project were carried out mainly by the undergraduates Afnan Azizi, Matt Orton and Jaclynn Smith.
Human Practices
The undergraduates Richard Robbins and Daniel St. Jules designed and programmed the game, "Gears of Evolution" for the human practices aspect of the project with science and art direction from Matt Orton, Afnan Azizi, Zuhair Syed and Ian Roney.
The undergraduate Bushra Khan wrote the essay entitled "Why Society Worries - The Social Apprehension of Synthetic Biology" for the human practices aspect of the project.
Wiki
The undergraduate Kyle Hinskens was in charge of web design for the wiki.
