"I don't always clone (that's actually not true) but when I do, I prefer BrickMason!"  Dan Jedrysiak
uOttawa 2011 iGEM Team
Instructors
Dan Jedrysiak
I am in the second year of my Master's program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine. I have been involved in iGEM as an undergraduate since 2008 and this year I am participating as an instructor. I don't always clone (that's actually not true) but when I do, I prefer BrickMason!
Alex Power
I am currently doing my Master's in Cellular and Molecular Medicine, and have been a member of the University of Ottawa iGEM team since 2009. I may not be as handsome as Dan Jedrysiak but I've still tried to be as valuable to the team as possible. We have a great project this year and I am impressed with the effort that all the team members put forth. I considered writting something about myself, like my hobbies, then I realized that I don't have any hobbies. I do, however, love synthetic biology and look forward to leveraging this love to build a billion-dollar biotech empire, or at least find interesting employment as a scientist.
Undergrads
Afnan Azizi
I'm entering my last year of studies in Honours BSc with Specialization in Biochemistry. I've had the privilege of being a part of the iGEM team for three years now, although due to some technical issues this is the first time I actually get to go to a Jamboree. As someone who's done both wet lab research last year and administrative tasks, as the co-president, this year, I can tell for a fact that the lab work is a lot more fun. At any rate, iGEM is fun in all its aspect and I am very pleased to be a part of this great community.
Kyle Hinskens
I am currently entering my second year in Software Engineering and I felt I needed to get involved with something. Participating in iGEM for the first time this summer has been an interesting experience. I may not know too much about synthetic biology, but I did learn quite a bit about designing a website inside a MediaWiki template. Just because the members of this team are epic cool, this country geek is looking forward to working alongside them next year as well!
Bushra Khan
This fall, I’ll be starting my 3rd year of an Honours BSc. in Biomedical Science with a Minor in English Literature. I’m incredibly excited to be a part of the uOttawa iGEM team as it amalgamates my love for biology and the real-world applications of science. With a few years of research experience under my belt and a past history as a competitive public speaker, iGEM and I are a great fit as it caters to my need to learn new things and to be heard! This year, I will be assisting the team by writing the human practices essay and getting some awesome t-shirts for us to showcase at the jamborees!
Wilson Lam
In the fall of 2011, I will be going into my second year of undergraduate studies of Honours Specialization in Biochemistry. This past summer has been my first year as a member of the uOttawa iGEM team, as a wet lab worker. iGEM has proven simply to be an amazing experience, by being a method of learning outside of the normal textbook or lecture-based education that we are all so familiar with. Aside from science, I spend my time making music, breakdancing, and enjoying a night out every so often...Oh, and you can catch me on Youtube at 1MaginAZN!
Simon Laplante
Student at uOttawa going to 3rd year Biochemistry.
Simon is the French guy in the team. He collaborates and collaborated with sponsors to help find sponsorship such as reagents to minimize the costs and to help the project move forward. He is also helping the team to find new ideas such as website design and look. He enjoys cycling hundreds of kilometers a week and he has a lot of laboratory experience already having begun doing research before entering university.
Fangshi Lu
3rd Year Biomedical Sciences
I helped in fundraising as well as logistics, and will be back in the fall to help out with posters and other various things.
I'm fairly new to the team, but I have confidence that this year's turnout will keep up the tremendous work that has preceeded us. So excited for this year's competition! :)
Matthew Orton
I am currently entering my fifth year of Biopharmaceutical Science with an option in Genomics. This is my fourth summer as a member of the uOttawa iGEM Team and since I am now a Co-President, my role on the team is wide ranging, from fundraising to wet lab work to administrative duties. I think what keeps me so engaged in iGEM is its interdisciplinary nature and the opportunity to be creative and innovative in a research environment. Other interests include running, reading and gaming. I really think the uOttawa Team has something truly exceptional and awesome to contribute to the competition this year and I can’t wait for the jamboree(s)!
Richard Robbins
This semester I'll be entering my 3rd year of a B.Sc Honours in Computer Science, with a minor in physics.
This is my first year contributing to the uOttawa iGem team, which has given me an excellent opportunity to gain some interdisciplinary experience. Looking forward to the jamboree and coming back next year!
Kuba Rogowski
3rd year Honours BSc with Specialization in Biology
Graphic design and logistical support
This is my second year contributing to the uOttawa iGEM team and I'm looking forward to my first Jamboree!
Ian Roney
Ian is currently entering his 3rd year of biomedical sciences. His ability to understand obscure references is simply amazing. But do not let that innocent face fool you: underneath lies a relentless wit of sarcasm. Although this is only his first year as a part of iGEM, Ian has made a significant contribution to the team from wet lab work to fundraising to providing great ideas and being hilarious. Ian is quite ecstatic to go to the jamborees.
Jaclynn D. Smith
Currently heading into my 3rd year of a B.Sc. with specialization in Psychology
Role: Part of the administrative team!
I'm super excited to be attending my first Jamboree this year as I have been admiring the uOttawa iGEM team from afar for a few years and have finally gotten involved with the team this year!
Daniel St. Jules
20 year old programmer and designer. Going into 3rd year Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Computer Science.
Though it's my first year participating in iGem, I'm hoping it won't be my last. Can't wait for the jamboree too!
Zuhair Syed
Zuhair is entering his third year of biomedical sciences with a  minor in math.
Zuhair's role on the team is to supply us with an endless amount of family guy references, super hero movie reviews and bash apple for everything they have ever made. This is Zuhair's first year on the iGEM team and he has worked tremendously hard in the lab this summer. He will be one of our presenters at the Jamboree(s).
Naveen Venayak
5th year Biotechnology (B.Sc. Honours Biochemistry and B.A.Sc. Chemical Engineering)
I've always been interested in biochemistry and engineering and systems biology allows me to apply my two interests simultaneously. iGEM is a great way for me explore systems biology with my peers.
