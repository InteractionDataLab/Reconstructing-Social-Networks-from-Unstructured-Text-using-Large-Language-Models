With a few years of research experience under my belt and a past history as a competitive public speaker, iGEM and I are a great fit as it caters to my need to learn new things and to be heard! This year, I will be assisting the team by writing the human practices essay and getting some awesome t-shirts for us to showcase at the jamborees!</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="collapse" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><TBODY><TR><TD class="center top" style="width:210px;"><B>Wilson Lam</B></TD><TD class="top">In the fall of 2011, I will be going into my second year of undergraduate studies of Honours Specialization in Biochemistry. This past summer has been my first year as a member of the uOttawa iGEM team, as a wet lab worker. iGEM has proven simply to be an amazing experience, by being a method of learning outside of the normal textbook or lecture-based education that we are all so familiar with. Aside from science, I spend my time making music, breakdancing, and enjoying a night out every so often...Oh, and you can catch me on Youtube at 1MaginAZN!</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE class="collapse" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><TBODY><TR><TD class="center top" style="width:210px;"><B>Simon Laplante</B></TD><TD class="top">Student at uOttawa going to 3rd year Biochemistry.
Simon is the French guy in the team. He collaborates and collaborated with sponsors to help find sponsorship such as reagents to minimize the costs and to help the project move forward.

I think what keeps me so engaged in iGEM is its interdisciplinary nature and the opportunity to be creative and innovative in a research environment. Other interests include running, reading and gaming.
