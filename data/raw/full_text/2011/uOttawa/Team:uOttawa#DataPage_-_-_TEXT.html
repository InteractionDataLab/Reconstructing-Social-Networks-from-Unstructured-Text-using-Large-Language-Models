Figure 1: Two variants of a dual color inducible gene network integrated into the Ade2 and Ade4 loci of S. cerevisiae.  A – BBa_K642000 (which is tagged with BFP) binds to its GFP tagged trans-regulated promoter blocking transcription. B – BBa_K642004 (which is tagged with BFP and a VP16 activation domain) binds to its GFP tagged trans-regulated promoter activating transcription.
Data for our new favorite characterized parts:
http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K642000 – BBa_K642000, TetR repressor tagged with yeast codon optimized BFP: when placed downstream of the Gal1/10 promoter, can be induced using galactose to produce BFP expression. Our goal is to eventually have this tagged repressor act on the TX proximal promoter fused to GFP but we have not completed this.

Our goal is to eventually have this tagged repressor act on a tet responsive element upstream of the transcription start site of GFP but we have not completed this.
We also characterized the following part:
http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K642007 - BBa_K642007, Constitutive Adh1 distal-Gal1 proximal promoter tagged with yeGFP: this is the distal region of the mid length Adh1 promoter (BBa_K319005) submitted last year by the uOttawa team fused to the proximal region of the Gal1 promoter. We have demonstrated that it is a functional chimeric promoter and is inducible in the presence of galactose. The promoter is also tagged with the reporter yeGFP (BBa_K319039) which was submitted by the uOttawa team last year.
