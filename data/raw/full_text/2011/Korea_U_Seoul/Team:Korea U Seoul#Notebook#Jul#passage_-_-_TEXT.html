7/8 - Advisor's presentation
Plans for July~September
Advisor’s presentation
Mechanisms
Plans
Things needed to be ordered
-Vibrio harveyi; media check; KACC number check
Things needed to be done by individual members
-Analyze trends of supporting data
-Detection methods by TLC, GC, HPLC, and understand the mechanism
-Understand reasons for codon optimization
Things needed to be done as a group
-Group 1: Search for promoter and vector type
-Group 2: Search for C14’s usage; cost, etc.
-Group 3: Search for medium conditions
7/22 - Presentation on experiment
Group 1
Presented about
1. Plasmid in which the gene will be incorporated
2. Promoter Tac = hybrid of E.coli's trp and lac operon
- Strong promoter of gene expression
3. Induction can be done by the addition of IPTG(isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiolgalactopyranoside)
- IPTG is a derivative of lactose and is used as an inducer to operate the promoter.
4. Repression can be done by the expression of lac1 protein, which is a type of repressor
- lac1 protein is a DNA-binding protein involved in the metabolism of lactose.
- Promoter mutation: intracellular concentration of lac1 repressor is increased, leading to stronger repression.
