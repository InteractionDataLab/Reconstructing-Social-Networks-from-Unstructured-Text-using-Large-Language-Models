2/16 - The basics
Presentation at 2nd meeting
We had a second meeting to study about iGEM registry.
We learned about:
A reason for using low # in plasmid backbone's operation, and its merits and demerits.
How to express parts of plasmid such as RBS, promoter, ...etc.
Types of restriction enzymes
Why a scar occurs and how to prevent it (Silver's method, application of Berkley's method, Lim standard)
How to construct a backbone having desired origins and antibiotic resistance based on Reshma method.
Practical usage in companies.
Both parts and plasmids can be archived (recording, saving, storing)
What we didn't understand were:
Why scars occur, and preventing shift caused from it, and a relationship between mixed and scar.
What the meaning of 'shuffling protein domain' and 'overhanging of 4 base pair' in Lims standard are.
Relationship between restriction sites E, S, N.
2/18 - Parts registry
We continued studying about parts registry.
http://partsregistry.org/Part_Names
http://partsregistry.org/Help:BioBrick_Prefix_and_Suffix
http://partsregistry.org/Assembly:Composable
http://partsregistry.org/Help:BioBrick_Assembly
http://partsregistry.org/Assembly:Standard_assembly
http://openwetware.org/wiki/Synthetic_Biology:BioBricks/3A_assembly
http://partsregistry.org/Assembly:Rolling_assembly
http://partsregistry.org/Assembly:RBS-CDS_issues
http://partsregistry.org/Help:Ribosome_Binding_Sites
http://partsregistry.org/Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Catalog
http://partsregistry.org/Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Further_Reading
http://partsregistry.org/Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Glossary
http://partsregistry.org/Help:Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Mechanism
http://partsregistry.org/Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Design
http://partsregistry.org/Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Construction
http://partsregistry.org/Help:Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Standard_Assembly
http://partsregistry.org/Help:Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Mechanism#The_Shine-Dalgarno_Sequence
We studied about part's prefix and suffix and how to assemble it. We went further to find out what an RBS is, and studied glossaries and composition of them. Then we asked concepts we didn't understand to advisors.
2/21 - Q & A session
Today’s meeting was canceled due to an unexpected problem with school’s Wi-Fi. We therefore had a question-and-answer session.
The questions were:
Aligned space.
Orthogonal RBS
Meaning of 'various purposes of origin of replication'.
2/23 - Groups formed
We finished studying the 'Help' section of registry.
What we learned and did:
Termination, rho-dependent/independent pathway, types of RNA polymerase.
Design, components, construction, efficiency of terminator.
There are forward, reverse, and bidirectional terminators.
How to differentiate between natural parts and synthesized parts using barcode.
Parts symbols.
Read dissertations related to the above topics.
Questions
The relationship between poly (A) tract, poly (T) tract and bidirectional terminator
( http://partsregistry.org/Help:Terminators/Design )
What is a reverse primer and why we need to design it in oligo terminator construction
( http://partsregistry.org/Help:Terminators/Construction )
The meaning of forward/bidirectional/reverse terminator
The Existence of forward/bidirectional/reverse terminator in eukaryotic cell
The meaning of barcode in forward/bidirectional/reverse terminator
The meaning of stop/start/binding symbols
Conference
- We decided to see previous years’ finalists' research for brain-storming.
- Kyengwoo Jang will be editor-in-chief of wiki, and Min-jeong Lee will manage tweeter. Other members will also play a part in managing them.
- We divided the team into three groups for effective drawing of ideas.
Group 1 : MinGyu Kim, Seungwan Chae, Haerim Song, YunHyung Choi, Sooyoung Yoon, JinSick Choi.
Group 2 : JeongWan Chae, Kyengwoo Jang, Ji-hyong Nam, Jong woo Hong, Min-jeong Lee, Songa Jung, Areum Go.
Group 3 : Seong Min Pak, Yeji Chae, Seungbo Ryu, Hanon Lee, Beomgyo O, Heuiseop Jung.
- Once first semester begins in March, we will have meetings once a week.
- Until the end of March, we need to gather/organize our ideas and make overall outline of our research procedure.
2/25 - 2010 iGEM posters (Slovenia, Peking, Bristol)
We studied using 2010 iGEM teams’ posters. We focused on coming up with ideas and observing how the posters were made, rather than trying to understand the overall mechanism.
Slovenia
Zinc finger; viewing it methodologically: SPR, EMSA, beta-galactosidase activity
Explanation of oscillators based on ZNFs
Peking
Heavy metal decontamination kit; detection of mercury and its coagulation.
BCCS-Bristol
Measuring of nitrogen concentration using microorganism to measure soil fertility level.
Conference
- We decided to receive additional applications to join the KU-iGEM team until 28/2/2011.
- After first semester begins, meetings will be held every Friday at 7PM
- Leader of each group
Group 1 : MinGyu Kim
Group 2 : JeongWan Chae
Group 3 : Seong Min Pak
