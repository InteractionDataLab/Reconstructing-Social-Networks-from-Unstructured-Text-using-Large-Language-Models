Description
For alkane biosynthesis, we designed a synthetic circuit using bacterial bioluminescence system and aldehyde decarbonylase from Vibrio harveyi and cyanobacteria, respectively. Free fatty acids in the cells firstly are reduced and converted to fatty aldehydes by Lux C, Lux D and Lux E and then fatty aldehydes finally are decarbonylated and turned into alkanes.
