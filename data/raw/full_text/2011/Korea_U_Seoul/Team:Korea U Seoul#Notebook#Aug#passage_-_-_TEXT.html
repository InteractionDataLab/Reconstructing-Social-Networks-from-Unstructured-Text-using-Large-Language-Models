8/2 - Wiki team meeting
Discussing wiki and logo design
Meeting
- Discussed ideas for design.
- Basic design for the Wiki page is decided. We are planning on using Flash to design our page.
- Each member is responsible for coming up with a logo for our team.
- Logo designed by each member must be posted on Korea Univ. iGEM facebook page.
- All members will vote for the logo they think is the best, and the logo with the most votes will be chosen and posted on the main page of our Wiki.
8/5 - Presentation on experiment cont.
Group 3 Beomgyo's presentation
Group 3
Presented about:
- Methods that can be used to detect the synthesized compounds, which are fatty aldehydes, fatty acids, and hydrocarbons
1. Immediate detection
- Fatty acid detection by measuring changes in pH
- Fatty aldehyde detection by silver mirror detection
2. Qualitative analysis
- Infrared spectroscopy (thin-layer chromatography or high-performance-liquid chromatography will be used prior to using infrared spectroscopy)
- Mass spectrometry
By using infrared spectroscopy, the functional groups of the unknown compound can be identified. By using mass spectrometry, molecular weight and chemical formula can be found. We are planning on combining the results we obtain from both to deduce the identity of the compound.
8/19 - Advisor's return
Upon the advisor's return, we had a brief meeting to inform him about the progress we've made.
- List of members going to Asia jamboree at Hong Kong this October.
- Brief review of presentation session we had on July 22nd and August 5th.
