Bio fuel
The goal of our project is to produce alkane chains from glucose molecules. In nature, numerous biochemical pathways and enzymes exist, making life adoptable to even extreme conditions such as volcanic regions. We focused on biochemical pathways, enzymes of glucose metabolism and luminescene luciferase from Vibrio harveyi to achieve our goal. Based on glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, enzymes coded in luciferase genes (lux operon) and FAD from cyanobacteria, glucose is turned into alkane chain of about 13 carbon atoms in length. Synthesized fuel is functionally identical to natural petroleum and can be used as bioenergy. Produced alkane chain is part of a carbon circulation cycle as it is synthesized from glucose, in vivo. The fuel is relatively environment-friendly, unlike ordinary petroleum which increases CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Though the production of alkanes using bioblock could be not satisfied commercially, succeeding in the synthesis of alkane chains from glucose nevertheless will show another method of producing alternative energy source. Therefore, the success of this research will contribute to global effort in reducing atmospheric CO2 levels.
Project Abstract
Synthesis of Synthetic Micro-Alkanes
Our team concentrated on finding the solution to the world’s diminishing natural oil and gas resources and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of our project is the production of biofuels, alkanes, using bacterial cells as factories. Alkanes, so called “Green” hydrocarbon fuels, are chemically energetically the same as petroleum-based fuels, thus no penalty for use of conventional engines is encountered from their use. For alkane biosynthesis, we designed a synthetic circuit using bacterial bioluminescence system and aldehyde decarbonylase from Vibrio harveyi and cyanobacteria, respectively. Free fatty acids in the cells firstly are reduced and converted to fatty aldehydes by Lux C, Lux D and Lux E and then fatty aldehydes finally are decarbonylated and turned into alkanes.
