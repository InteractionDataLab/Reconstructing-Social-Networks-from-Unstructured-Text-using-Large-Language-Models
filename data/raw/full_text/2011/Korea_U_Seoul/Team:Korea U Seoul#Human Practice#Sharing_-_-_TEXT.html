CCP
CCP(Creative Challenger Program) is a Korea University program that is dedicated to promoting creativity in undergraduates by letting them form groups and engage in self-designed projects, while providing them with a suitable environment. It is sponsored by Center for Teaching and Learning, and they carefully observe, judge teams and their projects, while providing support. Topics for projects include natural sciences, liberal arts/society, culture/art/sports, economics/management, and engineering/information technology. Despite the wide range of topics, teams are encouraged to associate, making this program a center for idea sharing.
Korea_U_Seoul has participated in CCP since 2010, and through this program, we have been able to spread information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology. In January and September of every year, all the teams and each teams' advisors gather together and have a question and answer session. Doing so, we could share our topics and advance it further. Job-Ara team which participates in CCP has asked us if we could provide an orientation about our project and a lab tour for their student(for primary, middle, highschool students) job search program. We are reviewing the offer currently.
What we have now to look forward to is the January final presentation and poster presentation. Korea_U_Seoul team will continue to perform research for better results even after iGEM is over.
