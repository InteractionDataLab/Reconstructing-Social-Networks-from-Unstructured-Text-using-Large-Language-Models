9/2 - Plans for Asia Jamboree
14 members have decided to participate in the upcoming Asia Jamboree held in Hong Kong.
We decided that each member should book an airline ticket separately, because of the difficulty in booking seats for 14 people.
We have reserved rooms for 14 people at Regal Riverside Hotel.
9/18 - Briefing on experiment results
Overall result is as described below.
- It did not turn out very well as detection of hydrocarbon failed.
- We are not certain of the reason for the failure, but it must be either the compound's concentration was too minute to be detected or it was simply not produced.
- If detection failure is due to low concentration of the compound, we will have to concentrate the culture medium to increase the amount of hydrocarbon.
- TLC will not be useful for this task, so we will have to use GC to detect.
- The reason for using E.coli BW25113 is because of their promoter, Pbad. Bacteria that utilize Pbad utilizes arabinose as an inducer, and is not able to metabolize it.
To Hong Kong, one of our advisors, Han-Sung Roh will accompany us.
We formed teams for poster and powerpoint design, and organization of experimental results.
9/30 - Almost finished..
Current situation
- Codon optimization failed, resulting in low fluorescence
- We thought about using triton x-100(a type of detergent) on E.coli, which theoretically will weaken its membrane, letting hydrocarbon diffuse more easily. Our advisor however did not approve of the option.
- Other options available are
Extraction from the media
Extraction through cell lysis
