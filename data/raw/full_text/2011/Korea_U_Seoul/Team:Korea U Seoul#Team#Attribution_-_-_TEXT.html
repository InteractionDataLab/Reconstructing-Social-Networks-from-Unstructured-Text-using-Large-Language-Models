This page describes attribution of each member. Attribution was mainly based on the effort and result that a member made during iGEM activities and also considered how regularly a member worked on the part.
Although a lot of members spent effort on not only his/her charge but contributed to other parts as well, in attribution section, only main compartments that a member took charge on were considered.
So, there are limitations exist between actual activities that one made and one uploaded on this page, and therefore we now notice that describing all the detailed contributions that each team member made were difficult job.
