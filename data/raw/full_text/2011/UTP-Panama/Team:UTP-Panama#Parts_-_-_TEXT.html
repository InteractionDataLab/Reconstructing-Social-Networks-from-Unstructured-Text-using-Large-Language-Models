Favorite Part
The BBa_K672000, is our Favorite device, and was submited to the registry.
Our future developments
We also included in the parts registry our future mid-long term goal:
BBa_K672001 - Designed to improve the expression of the AOX1A protein in response to a cold shock by combining a CsPA promoter with the OmpA + AOX1.
BBa_K672002 - Similar to the nitrate sensor at low temperatures, but designed with a CsPA promoter instead of the HybB.
