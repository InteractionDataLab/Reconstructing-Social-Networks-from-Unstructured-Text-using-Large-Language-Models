Human Practices
We had a conversatory about models and methods that we could use to introduce the SynBio in Panama.We decided that we should begin this labor in our own university firs. We also decided to make a “SynBio” tour on the lobby of the main building of the Campus, with simple speech about the concept of SynBio in easy words. We had a wide mindstorm about the pros and cons and the impact of Synbio introduction in our country.
