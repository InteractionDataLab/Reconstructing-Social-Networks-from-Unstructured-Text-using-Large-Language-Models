I. OUTREACH
Our first challenge was to train traditional engineers (not trained in life-science) in the field of synthetic biology, especially in traditional engineering applications.
Here are some pictures of our SynBio Tour in our university:
I.I SURVEY
Here is the survey:
Here are the results:
I.II COMMUNITY BRICKS
CommunityBricks is an attempt to change the way that we do outreach and address human practices at iGEM. By creating an open source community of lesson plans and activity protocols, we hope to stimulate deeper, more engaging experiences for both sides of the exchange.
I.III ALUMNI iGEM
AlumniGEM is a new platform for connecting past, present and future members of iGEM. It will unite the iGEM community, resurrect old ties, and bring forward inspiring stories from past alumni. It has a forum where users can connect with each other and share every kind of information, especially about SynBio.
I.IV COLLABORATION WITH OTHER TEAMS
We collaborated with Brown-Stanford, Arizona State, Cornell, Panama and UQ-Australia in the development of Community Bricks.
I.V TV INTERVIEW
We were invited to the most popular TV Enterview morning show called "Tu Mañana", we had the chance to communicate on national television what is SynBiio and what we did on the iGEM Americas Regional Jamboree.
Here are some photos:
I.VI SURVEY FOR SB UTP 1.0
We made  a virtual survey to know if our program called SB UTP 1.0 (you can find more about it on our page, and you can also try it) really helps the user.
Here are the questions of the survey:
