Minipred of our Transformed Cells.
(Objetives or Title):
OBJECTIVE: Dirty Mini Prep 1. We 50mL Buffer P1 50mL (100μg/mL) (1mg/1000 g) = 5mg 5mg (ul / 5 g) (1000 ug / mg) = 1000 uL = 1mL 2. We falcom centrifuge tubes which contained approximately 500 L of our growing bacteria and Lb. Centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. The nomenclature for these tubes was RFP (Red Fluorescent Protein). 3. While centrifuged prepare 50mL of P1 and RNAse (5μg/μL) (1mL) both were held in cold, then mix that were labeled and kept in cold.
Note1: there was not enough RNAse (RNAse needed to 1mL of 5μg/μL) 100l use only which means that our P1 will 10μg/mL RNase concentration.
Note2: Falcom tubes containing bacteria that were not centrifuged, first we had to divide 1500 uL to each tube and then these épendor épendor if they are spinning.
4. The supernatant from the previous centrifugation was recovered and divided into tubes épendor. 5. They took these épendor centrifuge to 13000Rpm per minute. 6. Recover the supernatant and place it in épendor new tubes, add 300 L of each épendor P1 (in total 6 épendor). 7. We added 300 L of P2. 8. Tubes kept on ice for 5 minutes. 9. We added 300 L of P3 (the buffer had to be cold). 10. Tubes kept on ice for 5 minutes.
Note3: the above is worked out of the extraction chamber.
11. Centrifuged for 10 minutes to 13000Rpm. 12. Transfer supernatant to new tubes. 13. Add 1000 uL of phenol (working within the extraction chamber) Note 4: The phenol used was more dilute than that recommended protocol. 14. The tubes were shaken by inversion. 15. Centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 5 minutes. 16. We poured tubes and place upside down. 17. Were allowed to dry about 10 to 15 minutes, then re suspended in 30 ul and were maintained at 65.5 ° C.

Work Session
OBJECTIVE: Preparation of Competent Cells. 1. 250ml 100l take an aliquot of frozen cells at -80 º C. 2. Grow cells in a shaker at 37 °C
OBJECTIVE: Transforming Competent Cells using the BB of Bristol (BBa_K381001) 1. Antibiotic resistance of this BB is C11H12Cl2N2O5 Cloramphenicol Molar mass = 323.1g/mol.
Note = this resistance is given by the plasmid backbone that uses (pSB1C3). This backbone is the same project GaTech-UNAM and CINVESTAV. The final concentration in the dish of this antibiotic is 33 mg / mL.
2. To prepare 10 mL of stock: • We weighed powder 340mg Cloramphenicol • We add the above to 10 mL of ET-OH • Vortexiamos until completely dissolved • Filters with 0.2 mm filter • The final concentration is 34 mg STOCK / mL • We prepare 15 dishes with 10 ml of solid LB each
3. Concentration of antibiotic in each plate 33 mcg / mL For a plate: 10mL of LB (33 mg antibiotic / mL of LB) (mL/34mg antibiotic) = 0.0097 = 9.7 uL / ​​plate
4. Transformation Protocol, • Prepare 3 tubes of 50 ml falcon to make the total of 150 mL to fill the dishes. • To prevent the LB solidify place it in a water bath at 50 ° C. • We added 48.5 L of antibiotic to each tube to achieve falcon concentration of 33 mg / mL • The vertieron10 mL of LB plus antibiotic to each petri dish • Place the BB BBA-K381001 Bristol, was on the plate 4, position 1A. • Click on the plate and add 10 mL of purified water and then resuspended. • We stand for 5 min. • Remove everything that was in the booth 1 and place it in a épendorf tube, labeled with the name of Bio Brick. • In a épendorf control, Brick Bio 2μL added plus 50 uL of competent cells. • Leaving the tube in ice for 30 minutes. • The negative control hiso in an Eppendorf tube that contained only 50 uL of competent cells and also kept on ice for 30 minutes. • Heat shock was performed in a water bath at 42.5 º C for 1 minute and allowed 5 minutes on ice. • Add 200 L of SOC to each eppendorf tube (negative and positive control) and resuspended. • Incubate at 37 ° C with vigorous stirring (200rpm) for two hours. • Add 200 L of LB solid positive control and the same for the negative control. Labeled.
Note: SOC medium was cold, it is important to have fully resuspended proper concentration when you add it. When placed in eppendorf incubator should be sealed with a piece of parafilm.
Human Practice
Preparation of brochures for Outreach. Preparation of the slides regarding to the presentation for Outreach. Mindstorm about SynBio definitions & implications.
August 12
Human Practices
We were studying about the pros and cons of the SynBio and the safety regulations (for example the Synthetic Biology Report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues) for explain the risks and the safety to the people.
August 13
OBJECTIVE: Verify the results of past experience.
The results were not expected, perhaps due to the quality of cloranphenicol, for this reason we decided to prepare this antibiotic again.
