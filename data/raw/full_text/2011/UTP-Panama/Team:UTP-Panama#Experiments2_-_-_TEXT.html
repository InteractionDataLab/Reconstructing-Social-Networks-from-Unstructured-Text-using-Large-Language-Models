GaTech 2010 Biobrick BBa_k41000
GaTech 2010 Biobrick BBa_K410000
Objectives:
1. Test the BioBrick operation to different substrates and temperatures:
a. Substrates:
LB
Minimal essential medium
Saline solution
Lunar land
b. Temperatures:
8°C
23°C
37°C
2. Improve the characterization of the BioBrick tested in other substrates to study the performance of the promoter.
3. Define the Biobrick promoter strength at the temperatures and selected substrates.
Methodology
We chose 4 temperatures:
• 5-10°C
• 10-20°C
• 20-30°C
• 37°C
These temperatures were selected so we could evaluate the response to cold shock in various ranges of our BioBrick. Since the lab equipments we had available couldn’t reach temperatures between 10-20°C this temperature was not used during the experience. Finally, the lab equipment allowed us to make the experiments in: 37°C, 23°C and 8°C.
We also chose 3 different Growth Media:
• Saline Solution
• Liquid LB
• Minimal Media
These growth medias where selected to evaluate the response of our BioBricks in different metabolic pathways.  We prepared 9 15mL Falcon Tubes, these tubes contained:
• First 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Saline Solution + a colony of the BioBrick.
• Second 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Minimal Media + a colony of the BioBrick.
• Last 3 (one for each temperature): 10mL of Liquid Luria Broth + a colony of the BioBrick.
