II. WHAT IS SB UTP 1.0?
The UTP-Panama team developed a plan for introducing of the concepts of synthetic biology to the people who are not acquainted with the field of synthetic biology to the theoretical foundations, applications, and finally the social implications of this science. The program also introduces the iGEM competition. The great contribution of the program is to introduce  users to the recommendations and ethical principles discussed in the PCSBI (Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues), Human Practice Trust, and other reports as a reference to the ethical, legal and social issues.
Flowchart1: It shows the three parts the SB UTP 1.0 is composed: about synthetic biology, about iGEM and a multiple selection quiz about general knowledges on.
