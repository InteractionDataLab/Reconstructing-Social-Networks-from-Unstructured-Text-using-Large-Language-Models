Spectrophotometry Results
Experiments with BBa_K381001
From these data we could conclude that:
• The BB grows best in LB.
• It grows less in Minimal Media.
• It shows almost no growth in Saline Solution.
• Il grows best @37°C
• It grows good @23°C
• It shows almost no growth @8°C
Experiments with BBa_K410000
From these data we could conclude that:
• The BB grows best in LB.
• It grows well in Minimal Media.
• It shows almost no growth in Saline Solution.
• Il grows best @37°C
• It grows well @23°C (best in Minimal Media than LB)
• It shows almost no growth @8°C
Experiments with BBa_K672000
From these data we could conclude that:
• The BB grows best in LB.
• It shows almost no growth in Minimal Media.
• It shows almost no growth in Saline Solution.
• Il grows best @37°C
• It shows almost no growth @23°C, just in LB.
• It shows almost no growth @8°C
We also studied the behavior of BBa_K381001 @23°C and @37°C in LB and Minimal Media; we detected the GFP expression using the spectophotometer, the graphs are shown below.

Discussion of Results
As we expected, our Renbo grew well at 37°C, grew regular under cold shock stress in LB (23°C) and did not grow at 8°C.
The BBa_381001 grew well alone at 23°C, better than the BBa_410000 and our device (expected to work better).
Looking at the results for BBa_410000, it decreases the capability of BBa_381001, under a cold shock.
From these results we could determine sources of errors during the experiments and learn from these for our further investigations.
The next step in our project:
Continuing with our original design, we are are planning to use another promoter as the CspA in stead of HybB, that improve the gene expression under cold shock. We will keep experimenting with our device.
It´s ok for our first year, with students without Life Sciences background!
VIVA iGEM! We learned a lot.... see you in Indiana and MIT
