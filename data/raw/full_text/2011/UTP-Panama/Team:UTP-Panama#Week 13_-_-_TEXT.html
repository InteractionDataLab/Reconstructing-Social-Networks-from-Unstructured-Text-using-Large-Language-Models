Week 13: August 29 to September 3
This week at same time of the Lab activities we had a lot of informal work session about our safety, track and abstract, for the September 2 Deadline. Of course our Instructor had a lot of bureocratic paperwork to paid the inscription and hotel reservation.

WET LAB
Proposal for Experiments with BBa_K381001
1- Proposal # 3 was done
The 3 tubes contained:
10mL of LB
20µL KNO3 1M solution
9,7µL chloramphenicol 34mg/mL
A tube as negative control was prepared, without  KNO3
Inoculated tubes with e. coli transformed with BBa_381001
Tubes were set with different temperatures:
Negative control at 37°C
37°C
15-20°C
20-30°C
2- Calculations for the preparations of the solutions utilized during the experience:
Preparation of 10mL of KNO3 1M stock solution:
MMKNO_3=101,1g/mol
<center>(1mol KNO_3)/1L×(101,1gKNO_3  )/(1molKNO_3 )×1L/1000mL×10mL=1,011gKNO_3
Expected Results
The functionality of the Biobrick is to detect presence/absence of nitrates, in this case was KNO3 0.20% in LB, in the tubes set at the indicated temperatures.
It’s expected that all tubes, except in the negative control, was observed a green fluorescence under UV light. And in the negative control, red coloration
SEPTEMBER 2, FINAL ABSTRACT DUE
The Born of "THE RENBO"
Between 11:00 pm to 11:59 pm (deadline of abstract due), Salomon used the mains letters of the "THERMOGENIC RESPONSE NUTRIENT BIOSENSOR" (our project title), to create "the RENBO", the official name of our project. This name is related with the capability of rise temperature and survive stress of our device.
