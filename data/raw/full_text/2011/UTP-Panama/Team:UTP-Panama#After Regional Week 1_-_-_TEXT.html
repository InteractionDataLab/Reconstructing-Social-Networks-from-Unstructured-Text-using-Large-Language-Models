35
falcon tubes of 15 mL
Missing:
- large gloves

October 19th
Ricardo reviewed  the inventory and provided us:
- 1 box of large gloves
- 1 bag with falcons 50 mL
- 1 bag with eppendorf of 2 mL
Also:
- solid LB works
- not necessary to do liquid LB (there is)
- we have to transform competent cells with:
- Bristol (the plate isn't so good)
- RENBO (the product was ligated in the ampicillin plasmid) --> to do minipreparation and electrophoresis
- Colonies only without plasmids.
Plates with RFP and GaTech are fine!
We had to:
- prepare new antibiotics
- autoclave the eppendorfs of 2 mL, they were ready to autoclave.
- prepare the Minimal Media for the experiments.
For the new experiments:
- we will use 5 mL of sustrates (liquid LB and MME)
- We did controls with and wothout antibiotics
- We used the following colonies:
- JM109 (just the strain without plasmids)
- with RFP
- Bristol
- GaTech
- Renbo
- We did controls using the two methods:
- Direct, studying the temperature
- passing through the thermal shock, first.
- Thermic shock was:
- @10ºC per 1 hour
-  Temperatures we used are:
- 37ºC
- between 15ºC and 20ºC  (18ºC)
- We needed 5 days of experimentation.
for each temperature and BioBrick we wanted to get (en each experiment):
- growing curve
- measurement of GFP expression
- measurement of RFP expression, as control
- measurement of heat production (thermometer)
Experiments:
#1: 5 colonies in LB and MM in blank, for references without antibiotics and without nitrate, @37ºC and @18ºC.
#2: 5 colonies in LB and MM with nitrate @37ºC and @18ºC.
#3: 5 colonies in LB and MM with antibiotics @37ºC and @18ºC.
#4: 5 colonies in LB and MM with antibiotics and nitrate @18ºC, first passing through thermal shock and @18ºC without thermal shock, direct growing.
#5: 5 colonies in LB and MM with antibiotics and nitrate @37ºC, first passing through thermal shock and @37ºC without thermal shock, direct growing.
Things we have to do for tomorrow, Thursday, October 20th,  2011:
- Transforms competent cells with:
- Bristol
- Renbo, ligated with ampicillin
Things we have to do for Friday, October 21st, 2011:
- take the plates out from the incubator
- grow a Renbo colony, in liquid LB @37ºC with shaker.
Things we have to do for Saturday, October 22nd, 2011:
- miniprep. of Renbo
- electrophoresis of Renbo.
Octuber 20
Bristol (choromphenicol)
Rembo (Ampycillin)
We used 4 plates for each ,renbo and Bristol:
First plate( LB ,antibiotic ,renbo)
Second plate(LB, antibiotic, competent cells without plates)
Third plate( LB,  competent cells)
Forth plate(Thermal  shock at 45°C for 1 minute)
4 parts of 500µl of competent cells
Using the protocol of page 40 but instead using 20ml of solid LB.
RENBO=  30 µl of ampycillin
BRISTOL=14.6 µL of cloromphenicol
Observations
1) We make calculations for 15 ml of lb .
2) For  the negative control ( LB + Competent cells ) we just use 1 plate,  so in the incubator we had 7 plates. 3 for Renbo
1(LB+ ampicillin+ competent cells)(control)
2(LB+ampicillin+renbo)
3(LB+ampicillin+renbo)
3 for Bristol
1(LB+ clorophenicol+ competent cells)(control)
2(LB+clorophenicol+bristol)
3(LB+clorophenicol+bristol)
1 plate generally negative
(LB + Competent cells)
