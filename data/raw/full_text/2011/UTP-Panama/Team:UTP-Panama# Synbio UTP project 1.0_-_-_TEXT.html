III.  WHAT IS SB UTP PROJECT 1.0?
Some of the main questions that arise when teams are developing a synthetic biology project are: where to go (institutions)?; under what legal framework for both scientific research and commercial projects do we proceed?; what kind of ethical challenges can we find, and how to introduce these issues into the education system?.The UTP SB PROJECT 1.0 is aiming to set these  questions to be asked and answered when developing a project related to synthetic biology. Our program also seeks to link the sources of information to help address these questions.
UTP-Panama The team encourages other teams and other players in the field of synthetic biology to collaborate with the growth and improvement of our program to include other aspects and problems that we havent developed in this first initiative.
Flowchart2: It shows how do you implement the synthetic biology on your community, institution or country. It is to do some reflections about repercussions of our projects in synthetic biology on the human practices.
This software is available,please click on the following link to download it. Please follow the instructions carefully.
1.Instructions:
Plese download it here: Media:Programs.zip‎
2.Then you must install winzip ( which is a compression software needed to decompress the files that have extension .zip.) , you can find it on the following link www.winzip.com and download it for free version,( only evaluation version). then follow the instructions to install it and use the evaluation version option when that windows is  prompted.
3. After downloading the SBUTPProject1.0.zip file,you must decompress or unzip the package in a new folder using Winzip(R).
4.To do that, you must remember the folder where you put your download SBUTPProject1.0.zip,please click on the file with the right button of the mouse, then click extract here, then there is just 1 step before entering to the application : step number 5
