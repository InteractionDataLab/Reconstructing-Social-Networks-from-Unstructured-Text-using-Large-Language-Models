 is a sophomore studying biology at MIT. Charles decided to participate in iGEM because he felt it would be an excellent 
opportunity to explore the manipulation of fundamental 
principles of life to engineer innovative solutions to challenging problems. He hopes to use the 
leadership and technical skills he gains from iGEM to help him in his aspiration of becoming a 
clinical physician. Charles has previous lab experience from working at the 
National Yang-Ming Medical University Department of 
Physiology Clinical Medicine Core Lab. While there, he 
researched the effect of anti- inflammatory chemicals on 
the recovery rate of wounded alveolar epithelial cells and 
designed a new error-minimizing measurement technique utilizing 
basic geometry software. 
Outside the lab, Charles spends his free time leading the 
MIT Freshman Heavyweight Crew as a 
coxswain. Charles is also an Eagle Scout and current Emerson scholar studying the 
viola with Professor Marcus Thompson.
</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="jzbio"><H1>Jenny Cheng</H1>
 is a recent graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology receiving her 
Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in June of 2011. Jenny decided to 
join the iGEM team to gain further experience in synthetic biology after becoming interested in the 
subject while working as an undergraduate researcher in the Lab of 
Molecular Self-Assembly with Peter Carr. During her time working in 
this lab, she created the TraceData application, which generates a 
Microsoft Excel document from DNA sequencing files and analyzes 
the DNA sequence. She looks forward to being able to continue to 
combine her solid computer science skills, which include the ability 
to code in more than 5 languages, with her lab experience to solve 
biological problems through iGEM. In her free time, Jenny enjoys 
video game design and animation and has worked in the Singapore- 
MIT GAMBIT Game Lab where she was part of a team that created 
the game Phorm. She also likes to travel and is fluent in both English 
and Mandarin Chinese. Last summer, she taught computer science 
to students at Hebrew University in Israel as part of the Middle East 
Education through Technology (MEET) Program. 
</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="mdbio"><H1>Michelle Dion</H1> is a rising junior pursuing a degree in chemical-biological engineering with a minor in 
literature. Michelle decided to participate in iGEM because she felt it was an ideal opportunity to utilize 
her knowledge of engineering and of biology to design and implement an innovative synthetic biology 
project in a team environment. Her interest in iGEM and synthetic 
biology stems from her belief that, as an athlete and MIT student, 
no one should be kept from pursuing their passions by physical 
limitations, such as disease or disability. She hopes in the future to 
be able to pursue a career in either medicine or biological 
engineering in which she is able to use synthetic biology to 
improve the lives of people suffering from chronic diseases.  
Michelle also looks forward to gaining extensive experience in a 
lab environment through iGEM as well. When not in lab, Michelle 
is a starter for both the MIT Varsity Field Hockey and the MIT 
Varsity Softball teams, where she has been a two-time NEWMAC 
Academic All Conference selection. She also spends time 
volunteering in the greater Boston area as a tutor for Tutors for All, 
a program dedicated to providing one-on-one instruction to 
students in underserved urban schools. 
</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="dabio"><H1>Divya Arcot</H1>
 is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biological Engineering as a member of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Class of 2014. Divya decided to participate in iGEM because she 
believed it would give her an unparalleled insight into the field of 
synthetic biology and the ways in which she could apply it to use in 
solving problems in immunology, an area in which she is extremely 
passionate about. Outside of biology, Divya’s interests include 
aerospace and space exploration. She is a member of the executive 
board of MIT Students for the Exploration and Development of Space 
where she serves as publicity chair. Divya also interned at the NASA 
Johnson Space Center where she created the infrastructure for an 
Asbestos Exposure Assessment Database, which compiles hazardous 
material exposure data into a well-organized format for NASA, OSHA, 
and the EPA. Divya was the 2010 National Winner of the National 
Center for Women and Information Technology Award for Aspirations 
in Computing and the Colorado State Winner and National Finalist for 
the Daughters of the American Revolution Good Citizen Award.  
</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="cpbio"><H1>Clara Park</H1> is a rising sophomore pursuing a degree in Biological Engineering. Clara became 
interested in iGEM because she enjoys the way in which synthetic biology is a dynamic, interactive field 
with infinite potential to be able to solve global issues. She was also excited to join iGEM because she 
felt it was one of the very rare opportunities that she would get to build something out of her 
imagination with minimal restrictions. Clara hopes to use iGEM to gain 
skills to build a foundation for her future career in synthetic biology. 
Outside of iGEM, Clara’s research experience includes being a research 
assistant in OLED Research at Hongik University in Korea where she 
developed a theoretical model for view angle dependent emission 
pattern of OLEDs and was a second author of a thesis published in 
Journal of Korean Institute of Electrical and Electronic Materials 
Engineers (KIEEME). Clara also has a patent under examination in Korea 
for a travel carrier that resembles a drawer to facilitate the process of 
packing. Clara won the Kyungki State government Global Leadership 
Award and the Taiwan Ministry of Education International Intelligent 
Creativity Contest, both in 2009.

synthetic and systems biology uses the elegant fundamentals of physics 
to solve the interesting problems of biology. He has extensive 
biochemical laboratory experience through working with Toxoplasma 
gondii, and has gained valuable experience in analyzing gene sequencing 
data, designing gene constructs for transgenic research, and 
fluorescence microscopy. Other skills include tissue hood protocol, RNA 
extraction, and microarray analysis. He has a paper published, titled “σE 
Stress Response in Mutagenesis.” During the semester, he is also a 
teaching assistant for MIT’s introductory biology course, teaching bi-
weekly recitations and preparing course materials for around 20 hours 
of work per week. In addition to his research experience, he ranked top 
in the nation as a finalist for the three separate competitions National 
Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Olympiad. Upon graduation, he hopes to continue his research in

</DIV><DIV class="bio" id="thbio"><H1>Tiffany Huang</H1>
 is pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as a member of 
MIT’s class of 2013.  From the cutting edge research and technology, to the infinite possibilities of 
working with the fabric of evolution, it was hard for Tiffany not to find synthetic biology interesting. She 
wanted to return to the lab to gain an appreciation for research and help pioneer an emerging field 
through this unique opportunity, although she anticipates devoting her future to programming and 
computer science.  She has a strong command over Java and Python through years of experience in 
using the two languages, and has worked with front-end web design as well as back-end programming. 
Tiffany exercises her artistic side through web design, photography, drawing, and violin. She also enjoys
