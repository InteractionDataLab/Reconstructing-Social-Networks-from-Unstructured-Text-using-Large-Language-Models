Current medical practices are only able to scratch the surface of tissue engineering or organ development. Fortunately, nature has provided us with robust, cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems, we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Both signaling systems were modified to feed into introduced orthogonal molecular circuits. This allows a number of signals to be processed logically. Finally, in order to hold our cells together to maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SMOL) and CompuCell 3D modelling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-assembly of ever more complex patterns and tissues.
A hallmark of higher order organisms is the development of multi-cellular structures such as tissues and organs from individual single-cell level interactions. A heart starts as a collection of generic cells but eventually these cells decide to become muscle, nerves, and blood cells that allow the heart to acquire the correct higher order structure and become functional. The fate of these undifferentiated cells is determined by intricate cell communication.
</P><P>Currently, naturally occurring receptor-ligand interactions and sensing mechanisms are just becoming characterized. However, most existing multi-cellular self-assembly systems have utilized cues provided by an external source. This year, the MIT iGEM team is creating an autonomous system capable of self-assembly of multi-cellular structures. These systems will examine the environment using receptor-mediated communication, make a decision to choose a certain cell-state, and create a variety of patterned structures.
</P><P>Specifically, we aim to construct a modular system involving juxtacrine cell signaling and G-protein coupled receptors. This will allow us to engineer interchangeable circuit responses using Mammalian BioBricks to inflammatory, cancerous, or infectious cues, leading to applications in tissue engineering, immunology responses, and cell patterning. Our efforts thus far are focused on demonstrating complex cell patterning and signal propagation through a population of cells, and we hope that our work will unlock a new realm of possibilities for the synthetic biology community and future iGEM teams.  The ability to program cells to self-organize through inter-cell communication would be a groundbreaking advancement for synthetic biology. We would create an autonomous system, independent of artificial scaffolding or guidance, a true mimicry of natural organogenesis.

This inhibition itself is inhibited by doxycycline binding to TetR. In this way, we can turn on expression of Delta-mCherry with dox in a modulated fashion
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Elowitz_Receivers">Elowitz Receivers</SPAN></H3><P>These genetic constructs have been stably integrated into our &quot;receiver&quot; type Elowtiz CHO cells. CMV (from the cytomegalovirus) is a strong constitutive promoter that will express Cerulean (a cyan fluorescent protein) and Notch. When Notch is bound by Delta, the Gal4esn is cleaved off and can activate expression of genes downstream of UAS.

Hef1a is a constitutive promoter that will express Gal4-VP16 that can later bind to a UAS promoter, leading to the expression of downstream reporter genes.

When bound by doxycycline, rtTA3 is capable of inducing expression at the TRE promoter.
