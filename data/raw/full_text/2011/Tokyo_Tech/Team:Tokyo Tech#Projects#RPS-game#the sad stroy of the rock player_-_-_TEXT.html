The Sad Story of the Rock Player
“I thought we E. coli could use all three signaling molecules for the RPS game, but every time I chose to play with a molecule different from that corresponding to Rock, I was ignored by the corresponding Judge. Because of this, I became frustrated and began to play only with Rock. I did not want to be ignored anymore.” (Player E. coli, 2011)
Thanks to our new parts, E. coli can now choose to play with either of Rock, Paper and Scissors again!
