Attributions and Contributions
1. Attributions
We are proud to say that all of the ideas we worked on this summer were proposed by undergraduate members of our own team.    We also want to thank all those advisors and instructors who help us discuss these ideas and guided us in doing the experiments.    All experimental data reported by the Tokyo Tech 2011 team comes from experiments done all by undergraduates.
The idea of a human-bacteria Rock-Paper-Scissors game (Tomoyuki Ohno),    the idea of bacteria that could make it rain (Hiroki Yoshise),    and the idea of bacteria that could help us make coolers (Natsuki Kubo)    were all proposed by undergraduate members of our team. Modeling related to our    Rock-Paper-Scissors game was also done by undergraduate students (Alejandro Tsai, Takashi Kitashima)    with the support and guide of our advisor (Hata).
