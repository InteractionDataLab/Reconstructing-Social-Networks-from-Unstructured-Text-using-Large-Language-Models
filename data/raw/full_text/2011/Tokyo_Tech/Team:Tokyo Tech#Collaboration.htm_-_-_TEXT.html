On June 26th, nine Japanese iGEM teams held another friendly meeting in Tokyo Metropolitan University in spirit of    exchanging ideas and opinions. In this meeting, each team introduced their project to other teams, and afterwards    further discussion of the projects took place between members of different teams.
