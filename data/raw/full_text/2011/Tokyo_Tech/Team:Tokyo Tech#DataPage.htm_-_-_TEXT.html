Data page
This page shows a list of all the parts that    we have made or used in the project.    Click on the link for each part to see    more details about that part on the    Registry of Standard Biological Parts.    For a brief overview of our main results,    please have a look at our Main Results page.
1. How our system Works
2. Data For Our Favorite New Parts
BBa_K649001 -- GFP regulated by 3OC12-HSL and LasR
in the presence of 3OC12-HSL, lasI promoter can be induced to express a marker gene(gfp).
BBa_K649202 -- PlacIQ-lox71-rbs-rfp-lox66-rbs-gfp
in the presence of Cre, a marker gene (rfp) between lox71 and lox66 is knockout, and a marker gene (gfp) is expressed.
BBa_K649301 -- Ptrc-rbs-rocF
because arginase is constitutively expressed, the expression level of urea in E. coli transformed with BBa_K649301 was higher than geneless E. coli.
3. Data For Pre-existing Parts
BBa_J64010:Experience -- lasI promoter, BBa_J64010 (Voigt Lab, 2007)
fluorescence intensity of PlasI (BBa_J64010) -gfp did not change before and after 3OC12-HSL induction.
BBa_I751101:Experience -- J540140 dPr + hybrid promoter (Plux-lac), BBa_I751101 (Tokyo Tech, 2007)
fluorescence intensity of BBa_I751101 was increased by both 3OC6-HSL induction and IPTG induction.
BBa_K117002:Experience -- LsrA promoter (indirectly activated by AI-2), BBa_K117002 (NTU-Singapore, 2008)
in the absence of LsrR, fluorescence intensity of PlsrA (BBa_K117002) -gfp was lower than that of promoterless negative control.
4. We’ve Also Characterized the Following Parts
BBa_K649104 -- PlsrA-rbs-gfp
in the absence of LsrR, fluorescence intensity of BBa_K649104 was much higher than promoterless-gfp (negative control).
BBa_K649105 -- PlsrA-rbs-gfp-TT-PlsrR-rbs-lsrR
PlsrA (BBa_K649100) was repressed by LsrR and fluorescence intensity of BBa-K649105 decreased 3-fold.
BBa_K649200 -- PlacIQ-lox2272-rbs-gfp-lox2272
in the presence of Cre, the sequence between two lox2272 is knockout.
BBa_K649201 -- PlacIQ-lox2272-rbs-rfp-lox2272-rbs-gfp
in the presence of Cre, a marker gene (rfp) between two lox2272 is knockout, and a marker gene (gfp) is expressed.
BBa_K649303 -- PlacIQ-rbs-ispS
we confirmed that E. coli introduced ispS produced isoprene, by means of using electron-ionization Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry equipment.
BBa_K649401 -- Arg box
because Arg Box is the arginine operator which the arginine repressor can bind to, the expression level of urea in E. coli transformed with BBa_K649401 was higher than mock E. coli.
BBa_K649402 -- Ptrc-rbs-rocF-Arg box
because we transformed E. coli with BBa_K649402 on low copy plasmid, Arg box did not replicated adequately and we could not confirm whether Arg box was working or not.
