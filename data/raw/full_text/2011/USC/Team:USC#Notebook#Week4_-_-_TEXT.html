Week 4:
06/27/2011
1. Lab meeting
06/28/2011
1. Observation from yesterday:
Only transformation of OLE1grow on plates, others don’t
2. PCR MSN ligation products in Cyle #1, pick E, F, G , H colony
3. Ligate OLE1, MSN2, TSP1, ELO1 with pRS vectors 423-426
4. Transform the ligation samples
5. Plasmid DNA purification for:
BBa-K191005
BBa-K191004
BBa-K426020
BBa-I15010
06/30/2011
1. Digest MET25 and pRS vectors
Notes: for pRS vectors, add 1 µL of phosphatase, incubate for 30min and spin column purify
For MET25 promoter, run reaction on a1% agarose gel, then cut out the agarose and purify with column
2. Transform and inoculate tetR, tetO, CASO and CRISPR
07/01/2011
1. Mini-prep
tetR, MET25, CRISPR and tetO
2. Gel verification for
TPS1, MSN2, ELO1, OLE1, tetO, MET25, CRISPR, tetR
Observation: tetO didn’t work, OLE1 and MSN2 worked
