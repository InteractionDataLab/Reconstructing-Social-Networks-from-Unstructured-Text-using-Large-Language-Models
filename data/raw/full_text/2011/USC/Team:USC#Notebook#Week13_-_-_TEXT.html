Week 13:
09/06/2011
1. Digest/ ligate casO+PCDF
2. Transform ligated products into BL21 with tetO::GFP
3. Transform CRISPR GFP#7 into BL21 with tetO::GFP
4. Inoculate HT5 with/without IPTG
5. Inoculate HT115+tetO::GFP
6. Purify casO (PCR products)
7. Measure the DNA of casO::PCDF
09/07/2011
1. Make competent cells as follows:
BL21 (tetO::GFP, CRISPR::GFP)
HT115(tetO::GFP, CRISPR::GFP)
HT115(tetO::GFP)
2. Take OD reading of HT115 with/ without IPTG
3. Digest/ligate casO+PCDF
4. Transform CRISPR#7 into tetO cells(BL21)
5. Take equal amount of E.Coli, miniprep, transform into new DH5α, select on amp.
09/19/2011
1. Growth test, grow all the bacteria overnight
2. PCR cas3+casO from gDNA
09/08/2011
