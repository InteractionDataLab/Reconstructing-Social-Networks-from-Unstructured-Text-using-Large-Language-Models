Attributions and Contributions
An iGEM project needs a great team to accomplish and it can not be done by one day. Our team is built up of 1 instructor and 7 students (1 student advisor, 1 graduate student, and 5 undergraduate students). During the whole summer of 2011, our team members were working on CRISPR or "E. Curi"  cooperatively with our instructor. We would like to thank the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, the David and Dana Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, and the Viterbi School of Engineering for their help and support.  We also appreciate the help of all the sponsors and Dr. Brouns from Wageningen University.
Details about our members' work are listed:
Alexa brainstormed with the team and cooperated with other members to do research involving the CRISPR system.
Kevin brainstormed with the team, cooperated with other team members, spearheaded scholarly research, and designed the human practices event. His background in physics and mathematics provided useful counterpoints and insights to other aspects of early stage projects and then eventually the CRISPR system.  Led the T-Shirt designing process.
Dongzhu's chemical engineering knowledge was applied to an earlier idea of enhancing yeast ethanol tolerance.  As the team decided to move forward with the CRISPR system, he brought his insight and knowledge into that project.  Dongzhu designed the hardcopy survey for the human practices event and was one of the main contributors/editors to the wiki page.
Ellen brainstormed with the team, cooperated with other team members, and was engaged in an early stage idea of rust detection and elimination. Her background in biology and years of experience in wetlab techniques were very valuable during research and implementation of the CRISPR system.  Ellen led the implementation of the social media aspect of the human practices event.
Indi brainstormed with the team and cooperated with other members to do research involving the CRISPR system. She was also heavily involved in the T-shirt design process and helped launch the wiki page.
Percy was involved in the initial brainstorming and early project investigations.  He led and contributed to the development of implementing the CRISPR system.  He was the led on the CRISPR project and ran the project implementation from day to day, including, but not limited to wetlab research, team networking, fund acquisition, and non-standard part acquisition. He helped design both the panel discussion and social media aspects of the human practices event.  Percy was also one of the main contributors/editors to the wiki page.
Nolan was involved in the initial brainstorming and early project investigations.  He acted as team manager, university liaison, fundraiser, scientific/engineering adviser and all around good guy. Design and wrote simple matlab code to analyze growth testing data and determine OD Levels based on the data.  Nolan was also one of the main contributors/editors to the wiki page.
Dr. Sean Curran graciously provided the team with lab space, equipment, reagents and supplies.  As the advisor he organized the iGEM effort at USC, recruited an outstanding team, organized and led the early training of non-experienced iGEM members, and led all brainstorming and wetlab efforts.  An invaluable resource, USC iGEM would not have gotten off the ground without him, thank you Dr. Sean Curran.
