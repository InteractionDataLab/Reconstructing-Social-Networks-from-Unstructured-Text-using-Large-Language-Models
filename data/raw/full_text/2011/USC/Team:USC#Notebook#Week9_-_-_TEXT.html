Week 9:
08/01/2011
1. Lab meeting: set up all the work for the week
2. PCR CAS3
3. Make competent cells of tetR+tetO, grow overnight
4. Run digestion for PCOLA::CASO (7 samples)
08/02/2011
1. Mini prep DNA isolation of 23 plasmid
2. Digestion by BamHI and NcoI
3. Run a gel to verify
4. Prepared samples for DNA sequencing, including old ones from 07/28/2011
5. Mini-prep 48 colonies from PCOLA with CASO+4 colonies from PCDF with CASO
6. Digest 10 µL of miniprep for verification by gel
08/03/2011
1. Repeat 8 mini-prep from PCOLA with CASO
2. Digest samples from 6-8
3. PCR PCDF+CASO#4 to check if this plasmid has CASO or not
Have a positive control using 1mL of DH5α gDNA
08/04/2011
1. Make competent cells for tetR and tetO
2. Digest POCLA by NcoI-HF
3.  PCR PCDF+CASO#4
Observation: gel didn’t show anything, maybe due to evaporation of PCR product, we would repeat gel later
