Our Biobrick 1: BBa_K512000
We've focussed on building one key new BioBrick; BBa_K512000; encoding cas3 genes which can improve CRIPSR. During the project we both made and well characterised this part, details of which can be found in our Notebook section, whilst information on its sequence and how to get hold of it can be found at the [1] page on the parts registry website.
Our Biobrick 2: BBa_K512001
We also builded another key new BioBrick; BBa_K512001; encoding casABCDE12 genes which is a series of cas genes responsible for CRISPR interference to work in E. coli. During the project we both made and well characterised this part, details of which can be found in our Notebook section, whilst information on its sequence and how to get hold of it can be found at the [2] page on the parts registry website.
Our Biobrick 2: BBa_K512002
This is our most important BioBrick; BBa_K512002; which is the CRISPR system with GFP target spacer we use during our research.  It can target GFP plasmid in E. Coli cells and degrade it. Again, during the project we both made and well characterised this part, details of which can be found in our Notebook section, whilst information on its sequence and how to get hold of it can be found at the [3] page on the parts registry website.
