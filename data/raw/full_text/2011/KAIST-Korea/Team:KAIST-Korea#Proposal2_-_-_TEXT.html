Proposal 2
Necessity
Even in the absence of an inducer, genes introduced via a vector are translated into proteins. This is termed leaky expression.
These proteins draw energy reserved for cell's metabolism.
Hence, life times of cells decrease.
Approach
Attach a sigma factor to a zinc finger and anchor the fusion protein in the T7 promoter region.
RNA polymerase bound for the promoter are coaxed to bound to the fusion protein.
Less RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, therefore, and hence leaky expression decreases.
Thank you!
