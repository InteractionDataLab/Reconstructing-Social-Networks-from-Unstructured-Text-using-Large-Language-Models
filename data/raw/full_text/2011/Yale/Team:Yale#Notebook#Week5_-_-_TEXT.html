Week 5: June 12-June 19
Monday:
Ran another SDS-PAGE gel to verify expression, but unable to find protein (see Figure)
Tuesday:
Tried UV-vis 280 absorbance on Tokyo Tech eGFP-TmAFP fusion proteins; too messy (see lab notebook, Nanodrop pictures)
Fluorescence via fluorimetry of Tokyo Tech protein indicates GFP is found in supernatant, but not in pellet from lysate
Ran Western blots on ZeAFP and TmAFP from Tokyo Tech (see Figure)
Started planning Ice survival assays (need to do serial dilutions instead of changing the volume. After speaking to Fikrig lab, they told us this is better. If OD600 = 1, this is approximately 1e9 CFU/ml. If you do a dilution to 10^-5 and plate 100ul, you get 1000 colonies. 10^-6 you get 100 colonies, 10^-7 you get 10 colonies. You plate all these dilutions. No IPTG is needed on plates because after freezing you are done with the experiment. Media should be left overnight but better 2 days to cool at room temperature. Then store in fridge upside down. No fractures or moisture. Do to serial dilution use large volume,s 900ul diluant and 100ul of stuff. Can resuspend in media, or water, or PBS, or 0.9% NaCl solution, dpenending on how much want to stress. Repeat dilution series 2-3 times. Use new dilution series after frozen to replate dilution series).
Wednesday:
Received Israel plasmids for variants of TmAFP
Transformed all Israel plasmids into DH5alpha
Prepared sequencing samples to be sent to Keck Biotechnology Center
Started growing Israel plasmid transformed samples to OD 0.6, add 0.5mM IPTG, induce for 48 hours at 15C. After shaking centrifuge 30 min 2700g, 4C. Flash freeze store -20oC. Same with Canada GFP.
Thursday:
Received IDT Synthetic RiAFP gene: Took tube that we got from IDT, centrifuged to get DNA at bottom, resuspended in 20uL of 10mM Tris, 0.1mM EDTA buffer PH 7.5-8.0, to get 0.1ug/ul. Incubated rt 30 mins, vortexed 20s. Then centrifuged 1 min. Added 1ul of stock to 999ul water. Then used 2ul of this to xform bacteria.
