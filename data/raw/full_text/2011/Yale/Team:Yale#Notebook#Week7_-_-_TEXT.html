More cloning struggles...
Run colony PCR on ZeAFP = successful; miniprepped from successful colonies and sent in to Keck for sequencing verification, which is successful
Cloning attempts of RiAFP: successful digestion + ligation => successful colony PCR and sequencing samples
More detailed descriptions of failed cloning experiments in physical lab notebooks
