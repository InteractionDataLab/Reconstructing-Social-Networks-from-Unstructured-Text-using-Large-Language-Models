Cloning struggles:
Multiple attempts to PCR amplify ZeAFP with Taq and Phusion polymerase failed
Eventually succeed with Taq, digest with XbaI and SpeI
Ligate with T4 DNA ligase
Survival assays:
Completed survival assays on induced and uninduced MBP-TmAFP, eGFP-TmAFP, eGFP-TEV-TmAFP samples to determine greatest freeze-thaw viability (see assays page)
