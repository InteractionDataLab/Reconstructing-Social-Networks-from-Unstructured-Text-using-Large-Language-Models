Designed and ordered primers with BioBrick prefix and suffix overhangs to PCR amplify following constructs
RiAFP-His
eGFP-TEV-RiAFP-His
eGFP-TmAFP-His
eGFP-TEV-TmAFP-His
TmAFP-His
Set up PCR amplification with Phusion polymerase of aforementioned constructs, verified successful amplification: (show figure)
Digest PCR fragments using XbaI and PstI, digest BioBrick BBa_I712074 (contains T7 polymerase) with SpeI and PstI
Ligate using T4 ligase, transform cells and plate on Amp plates (backbone of plasmid is AmpR and KanR)
Verification of successful ligation using colony PCR
