Week 11: July 24-31, 2011
Monday:
Regenerate Nickel columns
Incubate sample with beads
Survival assay
Tuesday:
Survival Assay again
Elution from loose beads + SDS
Wednesday:
Run flow-through through beads again
Thursday:
Researched ice-affinity purification
Dialyzed sample
Friday:
Planned/mapped out next 4 weeks
Took dialyzed bag with purified eGFP-RiAFP and divided it into 12 eppendorfs, containing 1 mL each.  Flash-froze tubes in liquid nitrogen, then quickly used a hot edge to poke holes into top of eppendorfs to allow sublimation.  Tubes then placed in lyophilizer for 3 nights.
Saturday:
Began cloning all pSB1AK8 constructs into pSB1C3 for parts submission (G3, H1, RiA, RiG, T2, Z2?) by digesting those 6 constructs and linearized pSB1C3 with EcoRI, PstI
Also, PCR amplified eGFP segment from original eGFP-RiAFP plasmid to use as a control for survival assays
Digested PCR fragment with eGFP with XbaI, PstI, and digested BBa_I712074 (strong T7 promoter) with SpeI and PstI
Gel extracted all digested pSB1AK8 constructs using kit, gel visualized with SYBRSafe (digestion seemed successful)
Sunday:
Ligated gel-extracted pSB1AK8 fragments with pSB1C3; ligated eGFP PCR fragment with BBa_I712074
Transformed ligations into DH5alpha cells, plated them
