tRNA Modulator System
System Analysis
tRNA Modulator + Reporter for Qualitative Analysis
Action: when rare tRNAArg is over expressed, the amount of tRNAArg in the tRNA pool is largely increased, which facilitates ribosome to get through the tandem of AGG codons in the RFP's mRNA.
tRNA Modulator + Reporter for Quantitative Analysis
Action: when rare tRNAArg is over expressed, the amount of tRNAArg in the tRNA pool is largely increased, which facilitates ribosome to get through the tandem of AGG codons in the modified luciferase's mRNA.
Conclusion
We have analyzed the three potential factors influencing Rare-Codon Switch and have fully characterized our device through working curves, demonstrating the function of this device as a regulating tool for protein biosynthesis. We have also identified influential factors other than the three proposed above.
aaRS Modulator System
System Analysis
aaRS Modulator + Reporter for Qualitative Analysis
Action: When TDRS is expressed under IPTG induction, it can charge tRNAAsp-AGG with Asp. tRNAAsp-AGG then recognizes the rare codon AGG on RFP's mRNA and add Asp to the polypeptide chain. RFP is expressed.
aaRS Modulator + Reporter for Quantitative analysis
Action: When TDRS is expressed under IPTG induction, it can charge tRNAAsp-AGG with Asp. tRNAAsp-AGG then recognizes the rare codon AGG on the modified luciferase's mRNA and add Asp to the polypeptide chain. Modified luciferase is expressed.
Conclusion
We have designed modified AspRS and tested its aminoacylation ability, ensuring the function of our Rare-Codon Switch.
