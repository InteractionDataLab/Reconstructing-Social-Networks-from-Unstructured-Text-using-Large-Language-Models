The most brilliant character of tRNA is <B>“transfer”</B>, which can be interpreted as <B>COMMUNICATIONS</B> and <B>CONNECTIONS</B>. Thus, we'd like to realize these two words in our human practice. Let’s <B>COMMUNICATE</B> and <B>CONNECT</B>!
</P><P>
To put this idea into practice, we have designed a set of CUTE postcards to <B>COMMUNICATE</B> with schoolmates and <B>CONNECT</B> other iGEMers! <B>Check It Out!!!</B></P><P>To <B>COMMUNICATE</B> our thoughts about synthetic biology with students in school, we decided to distribute the postcards. 
</P><P>Team members preparing to go out to distribute tPostCards.
</P><P>Firstly , we have communicated with the professors of the school of life science, listening to their attitude and idea on the synthetic biology and their suggestion on our team. After the pleased talk with them, we came to understand their attitude and their idea toward new growing field  that the synthetic biology has been developing rapidly in the academic field which provide a new idea for the scientific research in life science. Furthermore, in their opinion, by integrating and utilizing parts, a great amount of the idea has been created and finally been realized which can shorten the distance of the basic research and the application in the academic field. Through these talks, we have obtained not only the precious suggestions and ideas toward our project and synthetic biology, but gained their encouragement and bless as well. 
</P><P>Secondly, we have invited the previous team member of the SJTU IGEM team of 2009 and 2010 to the lab, listening to the introduction and team situation of our 2011 IGEM team project and the team situation all over the world. Most of them were suprised with the rapid development of the IGEM competition and shared the details on how they thought how they covered the difficulties and what they did in the IGEM competition. By this pleased communication with them, we found out that the experience pass on through generation to generation of a IGEM team--just like the registry to the IGEM -- is very important to share and to heritage for the development of no matter the team itself, but the IGEM competition as well.
</P><P>Furthermore, we has shared these information about the IGEM and synthetic biology with more students and obtained their attitude and thought toward the synthetic biology and our team patiently. Only by these communication, could we understand the growing influence of the IGEM competition and the current situation of the IGEM competition. To the normal students of a university, only by the report of the good achievement of their team in the competition, can they obtained the information of the IGEM, caused by the high fee on attending the competition and the inefficient promote of the IGEM competition. Compared with the IGEM, they knew more on the synthetic biology from the teach and their own after class reading in the academic field. Through the communication with them, the emphasis from the leader of the university and the establishment of the class on the synthetic biology is far more important for the development on the synthetic biology and IGEM deeply. 
</P><P>Moreover, we have sent our postcards to and made communication with no only the Chinese students, but also the international students, by which we are willing to create more opportunities for more international students to get involve in the IGEM competition. Attracted by our lovely postcards, they have showed a great interest on what we were doing in the competition and listened to our introduction and promotion patiently. Compared with the local students, the international students in our school knew less of IGEM competition, but with the same passion after our introduction. 
</P><P>At last, we are also thrilled at the idea to CONNECT other iGEM teams with our postcards. Writing our best wishes, sticking stamps and putting the postcards into the mailbox, every step contains our full-hearted wish to develop and improve our friendship with iGEMers all over the world. Have you received our postcards? If not, come to us at the Jamboree to get one!
