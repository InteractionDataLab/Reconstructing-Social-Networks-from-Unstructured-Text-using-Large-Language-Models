Attributions, Contributions and Acknowledgement
Our team has accomplished all the project design, experiments and modeling by ourselves.
Advisors Lin HE and Gang MA offered us valuable advice and information.
Professor Peter G. Schultz from the Scripps Research Institute, Professor Andrew D. Ellington from the University of Texas at Austin and Professor David A. Tirrell from Caltech are so kind to send us the plasmids that we once needed. Though later we adopted our own design and didn't use the plasmids, we still thank these professors for their kind and timely help.
Professor Jianhua LIU from Shanghai Jiao Tong University offered us a lot of useful advice and technical support, we owe our thankfulness to him.
We also would like to thank our host lab for offering us the equipment and consumptive materials needed to perform experiments.
At last, we would like to thank Merck Millipore for their sponsorship. Besides, the advice from Dr. Volker Hilarius and Dr. Shou Wong have inspired us a lot.
We also would like to thank our second sponsor GenScript.
