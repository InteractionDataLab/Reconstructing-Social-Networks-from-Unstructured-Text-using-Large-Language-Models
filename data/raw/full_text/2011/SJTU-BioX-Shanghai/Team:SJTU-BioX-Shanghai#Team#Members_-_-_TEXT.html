From left to right: Xiaopan MA , Kaisi ZHANG , Yixuan ZHAO , Yunfeng RUAN , Chunying LI , Guanhao YE , Bo ZHANG , Bin ZHAO , You WANG .
The nine of us work together to make our project wonderful.  There have never been lack of laughter, cheerful discussions and diversity of ideas.
Here we are:
Chunying LI, or Chunchun(means spring), our capital
You WANG, or Super-You, our idea-high-yield-strain
Kaisi ZHANG, or Cathy, perfect English, good researcher and as lovely as a cat
Xiaopan MA, or Pony, creative artist who design our wiki
Yunfeng RUAN, or Fengfeng(means phoenix), interested in both biology and mathematical modeling
Bo ZHANG, our first ZB, nice guy and famous for his girlfriend in Fudan University
Bin ZHAO, our second ZB, nice guy, and good at literature search and an expert on express delivery
Xiwen ZHAO, or Bear, energetic and imaginative Kendo enthusiast
Guanhao YE, mathematical modeling expert, major in machinery
Chunying LI
I am Li Chunying, and my friends prefer to call me Chunchun, a lovely name,though I look like a little serious~~
Being the  team leader is not an easy task, but I feel very lucky to have such great team members, or I can call them 'battle compaions', helping me, teaching me, and sometime tolerating me~~
The whole progress preparing for the iGEM competation will certainly become one of the most presious and unforgettable experiences in my life and may change my way of life as well~
Thank iGEM for what it has given to me and I will contribute what I have and enjoy every minute when I am here.
You WANG
Live my life as an E.coli. I LOVE MICROORGANISM!
Kaisi ZHANG
I never forget to follow my heart in everything I do and every decision I make. Being an iGEMer is just one such decision. I love life science and I am always thrilled at how biotechnology can advance people's lives, iGEM is such a platform for us to discover and create. Being with my best friends and fighting for a goal with them has been a real enjoyment. I LOVE YOU GUYS！
Xiaopan MA
I am a senior student from Life Science & Technology School, SJTU. My friends call me Pony, as a nick name.
I love life science. The diversity of species, the circle of life and the balance of nature, all gives me the passion to explore the marvelous world.
Moreover, I love all the things of beauty and love to create beautiful things. I love painting, designing and creating.  Sometimes, it seems that I am an artist. The wiki of our team is one of my artistic works.
Together with the teammates, we spent a hole summer doing experiments and fighting for our dream. The days in iGEM are the most wonderful time I've never experienced.
Guanhao YE
Guanhao Ye is one electrical-engineer from SJTU 2011 iGEM team. He involves in computing to provide proper designation for the project and specify the mathematical model to reveal the quantity-changing properties of the substance during the process.
Two heads are always better than one. Working with students and instructors from different areas makes me learn much useful knowledge and lets me realize how interesting science really is.

Bo ZHANG
I am Zhang Bo from SJTU IGEM TEAM.
Major: Biotech
Hobby: Computer games, Hiking in the Nature, Basketball, Comics.
Dream: Smile and happiness around the world of mine
Statement:No matter the work is probably hard and full of the failure, a nunknown confidence of completing the work and solving the difficulties is always in my minds supporting me in the days passing away.
Yunfeng RUAN
My name is Yun-feng Ruan. ‘Feng’ means ‘phoenix’ in Chinese, so, if you like, just call me ‘Phoenie.’
I am fascinated by the beauty of living things and driven by my curiosity to it, I began to take part in laboratory research almost at the same time I entered the university. And now I am a senior student. Recently I gradually become fond of mathematics. Therefore modeling part of our project is of great pleasure to me.
In my spare time, I like reading, listening to music and practicing piano. I am also responsible for raising the mascot rabbit ‘Barnaby’.
Bin ZHAO
My name is Zhao Bin, or Alfred for English name from my favorite teleplay: Heart of Greed (HK). I am a undergraduate student majoring biotech in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and plan to go to PKU for PhD of genetics in next year.
In my spare time, I prefer to listen to some folk music, especially from deserts(Taiwan) and Emmy the Great(UK). Try to google them, and I trust you will like them. Another crazy hobby is postcard, collecting postcard and exchanging them. I swap postcards with friends all over the world at the website of postcrossing. I enjoy the feeling of sending and receiving these cards, and like to share my stories with stranger on the other side of earth.
I’m glad to make friends with all of you. Come and talk to me.
My E-mail is alfred_zh@yahoo.com.
Yixuan ZHAO
Hi guys ,I'm a member of the team from SJTU Bio-X center Shanghai,and you can call me Julian if you found the Chinese name Zhao Yixuan is awkward.
It's fantastic for us bioaholic to join such a creativity competition,as iGEM make 10 outstanding young researchers together to fight against all kinds of obstacles, across from PCR driving people mad to typhoon and awful takeaway food.
Out of lab, my identity is a trainee of Samurai,which means that every weekend is spend in the Kendo court with my Sensei and seniors.Despite the training of physique and skill,something even more important is strengthen my spirit and building up the tough consciousness,and that is through studing Zen and morality of ancient Samurai.
My major is biotech,while I am willing to do work in Brain Science in my Ph.D time,but I'd like to meet you who is interested in whichever field of biology.
