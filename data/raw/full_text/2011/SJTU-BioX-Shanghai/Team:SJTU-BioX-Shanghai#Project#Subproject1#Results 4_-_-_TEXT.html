aaRS Modulator + Reporter for Quantitative analysis
Results
After the qualitative analysis of aaRS Modulator, we stepped further to analyze aaRS Modulator with quantitative test. We have used PT7-Luc-4AGG ( BBa_K567009 ) as our Reporter to test the function of PT7-TDRS ( BBa_K567011 ) and tRNAAsp-AGG ( BBa_K567012 ). Results are shown below.
Fig 1. Functional Analysis of aaRS Modulator + Reporter for Quantitative Analysis. ER2566 cannot produce luciferase with PT7-Luc-4AGG ( BBa_K567009 ) only. When tRNAAsp-AGG ( BBa_K567012 ) and PT7-TDRS ( BBa_K567011 ) are co-transformed into the cell, luciferase is produced. The results proved that aaRS Modulator can regulate protein biosynthesis along with consecutive AGG codons.
From data however, we noticed that though aaRS Modulator can act as a regulating tool, it is not as effective as tRNA Modulator. We need to further optimize this Modulator in the future.
