The Project: Codon Switch Controlling Protein Biosynthesis
SJTU-BioX-Shanghai iGEM team is designing a set of Codon-Switches that regulate target protein biosynthesis (translation).
In our Rare-Codon Switch , the translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of rare tRNA amount , aaRS that charges the rare tRNA and rare codons .
Besides, our device can be made into switches that can be turned on/off without background noise in two ways. One is to use stop codon as the controlling element, the Stop-Codon Switch . The other is to use any codon but the original start codon to initiate translation, the Initial-Codon Switch .
Our design has expanded the regulating tools for synthetic biology and introduced brand-new methods for protein function analysis. See more about project applications, click here .
Achievements
Gold Medal and Best New BioBrick Part or Device, Engineered: BBa_K567011 & BBa_K567012 at Asia Jamboree. Advancing to World Champion!
Constructed three Codon Switches that controls protein biosynthesis, Rare-Codon Switch , Stop-Codon Switch and Initial-Codon Switch .
Used Rare-Codon Switch to turn up/down protein biosynthesis by controlling rare tRNA amount , aaRS and the number of rare codons.
Built our Rare-Codon Switch in silic and demonstrated the reliability of the model through our experiment results.
Constructed two strict switches, Stop-Codon Switch and Initial-Codon Switch , that can turn on/off protein biosynthesis.
Demonstrated device application by constructing and successfully testing positive feedback with our device in metabolic pathway.
Constructed 27 biobricks in our 3 sub-projects.
Analysed the structures of 18 aaRS with structural biological methods . Designed structures of 14 modified aaRS deprived of their anticodon recognition ability.
Expanded the regulating tools for synthetic biology and developed two brand-new ways that facilitate the study of protein function.
Designed our Human Practice Project: T-PostCards to promote our views on synthetic biology through communications and connections.
Promoted synthetic biology in high school class . Designed a questionnaire and did a survey on high school students' understandings and attitudes towards synthetic biology.
Attended the 2011 China Meet Up and presented our project idea to other iGEMer and advisors.
