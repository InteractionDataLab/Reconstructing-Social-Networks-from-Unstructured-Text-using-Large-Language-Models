Rare-Codon Switch
Rare-Codon Switch: control with rare tRNA amount
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - BBa_K567001 lacI -Ptrc-tRNAArg: The tRNAArg(drived from E.coli ArgW operon) is under the control of trc promoter, induced by IPTG.
Data for Pre-existing Parts
Experience -  BBa_I712019 Firefly luciferase (Anja Korenčič 2007)
We've Also Characterized the Following Part
Main Page - BBa_K567002 sulA promoter-tRNAArg :The tRNAArg is under the control of sulA promoter induced by UV.
See Project Design and Result
Rare-Codon Switch: control with aaRS
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - BBa_K567011 PT7-TDRS :Aspartyl aminoacyl tRNA synthetase without anticodon recognition domain under the control of T7 promoter and lac operator.
Main Page - BBa_K567012 tRNAAsp-AGG : The tRNAAsp-AGG with its anticodon mutated to CCU(base pairing rare codon AGG) and under the control of aspV promoter.
Data for Pre-existing Parts
Experience - BBa_I13521 Ptet mRFP (Endy Lab 2005)
We've Also Characterized the Following Part

Stop-Codon Switch
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - BBa_K567011   PT7-TDRS :Aspartyl aminoacyl tRNA synthetase without anticodon recognition domain under the control of T7 promoter and lac operator.
Main Page - BBa_K567013   tRNAAsp-TAG : The tRNAAsp-TAG with its anticodon mutated to CUA (base pairing stop codon UAG) and under the control of aspV promoter.
We've Also Characterized the Following Part
Main Page - BBa_K567003   Pbla-Luc-TAG
We've Also Made the Following Part
Main Page - BBa_K567018   PT7-GFP-TAG-RFP

Initial-Codon Switch
Data for our favorite new parts
Main Page - BBa_K567014   PT7-metGM : T7 promoter-metG(mutated). This biobrick is constructed by putting the mutated metG (Met-RS) under the control of T7 promoter and lac operator.
Main Page - BBa_K567015   PT7-metGN :T7 promoter-metG(truncated). This biobrick is constructed by putting the truncated metG (Met-RS) under the control of T7 promoter and lac operator.
Main Page - BBa_K567016 metY-CGA :This biobrick is constructed by mutating the anticodon of tRNAmet to TCG (base pairing codon CGA).
We've Also Characterized the Following Part
Main Page - BBa_K567020   KanR-CGA
See Project Design and Result
Positive FeedBack
Data for our new parts
Main Page - PT7-Luc-nAGG-tRNA(Arg). This biobrick is under the control of T7 promoter and lac operator.
