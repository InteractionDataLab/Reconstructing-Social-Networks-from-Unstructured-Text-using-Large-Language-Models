Rare-Codon Switch
tRNA Modulator + Reporter for Quantitative Analysis
tRNA Modulator and Reporter for Quantitative Analysis work together to regulate protein biosynthesis.
tRNA Modulator controls rare tRNA amount. In our project, we use sulA promoter ( BBa_K567002 sulA promoter-tRNAArg-AGG) or  trc  promoter( BBa_K567001 lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg) to control rare tRNA amount.
tRNA Modulator:
sulA promoter-tRNAArg-AGG( BBa_K567002 )
lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg-AGG ( BBa_K567001 )
Reporter can control two elements: the number of rare codons inserted into luciferase after start codon ATG and the strength of target protein promoter. In our project, 2, 4, 6, 8 rare codon AGGs are inserted into the Reporter gene. T7 promoter or bla promoter[1] are used to control target protein mRNA amount.
Reporter:
Pbla-Luc-2AGG( BBa_K567004 )
Pbla-Luc-4AGG( BBa_K567005 )
Pbla-Luc-6AGG( BBa_K567006 )
Pbla-Luc-8AGG( BBa_K567007 )
PT7-Luc-2AGG( BBa_K567008 )
PT7-Luc-4AGG( BBa_K567009 )
PT7-Luc-6AGG( BBa_K567019 )
PT7-Luc-8AGG( BBa_K567010 )
Note:Luc for luciferase
We have tested different combination of tRNA Modulators and Reporters and analyzed the influence of promoter strength for rare tRNA, number of rare codons in target protein mRNA and promoter strength for target protein gene respectively.
1.The Working Curve of tRNA Modulator
We have tested luciferin reaction in cells with different combinations of tRNA Modulators and Reporters. We examined the changes in luciferase enzyme activity over time after rare tRNA expression is induced. The amount of luciferase is reflected indirectly by the bioluminescence emitted from the luciferin reaction. Results are shown below:
Fig.1 (A)Enzyme activity of luciferase shown by bioluminescence emitted from the luciferin reaction reflecting the working curve of tRNA Modulator lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg ( BBa_K567001 ) under Reporter Pbla-Luc-4AGG（ BBa_K567006 ). (B)Enzyme activity of luciferase shown by bioluminescence emitted from the luciferin reaction reflecting the working curve of tRNA Modulator lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg ( BBa_K567001 ) under Reporter PT7-Luc-4AGG ( BBa_K567009 ). The working curve of tRNA Modulator lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg fits typical titration curve.
Here we use the above two curves as examples to characterize the working curve of tRNA Modulator. Both curves fits typical titration curve, indicating that tRNA Modulator can function as a regulating tool.
The rest of the working curves are shown here:

From this experiment, we noticed that the typical working curve of tRNA Modulator can be better observed with IPTG induced tRNA Modulator lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg ( BBa_K567001 ) compared with UV excitation induced tRNA Modulator sulA promoter-tRNAArg( BBa_K567002 ) , though sulA promoter-tRNAArg responded quicker to signals. We step further to test the influence of different Reporters with tRNA Modulator lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg.
2.Target Protein mRNA Amount: regulated by different strength of target protein promoters, T7 promoter and bla promoter
We examined the influence of different Reporter promoters on the working curve of tRNA Modulator, which is reflected by luciferase activity. Results showed that all the tRNA Modulator working curves fit titration curve, indicating that tRNA Modulator can act as a satisfying regulating tool.

However, the working range of tRNA Modulator is pre-defined by the strength of target protein promoter, T7 promoter and bla promoter in our project.

(B) Working curve of tRNA Modulator under Reporter PT7-Luc-8AGG. Here we analyze the influences of strong/weak promoter in the working curve of tRNA Modulator.  Moreover, strong promoter (T7) of target gene can improve the titration curve of tRNA Modulator, indicating that tRNA Modulator works better under strong target protein promoters.
3.Influence of different numbers of AGG codons put after start codon ATG in tRNA Modulator Working Curve.
The working curve of tRNA Modulator still fit titration curve under Reporters with different number of AGG insertions, indicating that the number of rare codons in the Reporter will not affect the stability and function of the Modulator. The influence of different number of rare codons in regulating protein biosynthesis is shown below:
Fig.9 (A) Comparing the influence of different number of rare codon insertions in tRNA Modulator working curve. Two Reporters are compared, Pbla-Luc-4AGG ( BBa_K567005 ) and Pbla-Luc-8AGG ( BBa_K567007 ). (B) Comparing the influence of different number of rare codon insertions in tRNA Modulator working curve. Four Reporters are examined, including PT7-Luc-2AGG( BBa_K567008 ), PT7-Luc-4AGG( BBa_K567009 ), PT7-Luc-8AGG ( BBa_K567010 ) and PT7-Luc-6AGG ( BBa_K567019 ).
Results show that the more rare codons are inserted, the lower the background expression and the narrower the range of tRNA Modulator can regulate. Besides, since the number of rare codons will not affect system stability, it can be an excellent independent regulating factor.
This picture reflects more clearly that the more rare codons are inserted, the lower the background expression and the narrower the range of tRNA Modulator regulation. We are able to predict the outcome of influence of different number of rare codons in protein biosynthesis, offering valuable information for device usage.
Future work:
We have obtained PT7-Luc-2x4AGG ( BBa_K567021 ) unexpectedly during our experiment. We have tested the enzyme activity of this part under tRNA Modulator control and have compared the curve with PT7-Luc-4AGG ( BBa_K567009 ) with the same tRNA Modulator. The result is shown below:
Fig.10 the comparison of enzyme activity between PT7-Luc-4AG and PT7-Luc-2x4AGG under tRNA Modulator lacI-Ptrc-tRNAArg.
The result reflects the outstanding performance of the newly gained part. Two 4AGGs occurred in the beginning of the gene can bring lower background expression and much higher induced expression compared with luciferase with singe 4AGG insertion. The additional 4AGG does not affect the titration feature of the curve.
Though we may not able to explain this phenomenon now, we have realized that exploring the potential regulating modes in our system is promising and significant. We will spare no effort in exploring and perfecting our system in our future work.
