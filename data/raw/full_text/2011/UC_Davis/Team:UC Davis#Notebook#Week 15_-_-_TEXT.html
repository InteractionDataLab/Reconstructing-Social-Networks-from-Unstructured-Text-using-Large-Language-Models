We've started to characterize our R0040 and R0051 mutants this week, and it can be easily said that these runs go much quicker than the R0010 ones. There is a lot more characterization that we would like to do, but our main focus has shifted to getting everything ready for the first jamboree in a couple of weeks. The wiki is massively improving every day and just about all of our parts are ready for shipping!
--Monday 9/19/11--  After the calibration run that we did late last week, we think we know what the actual values for our old arabinose stock were. Unfortunately, where our data started to line up was at the very end of the serial dilution, so we think our new stocks need to be diluted more. We're going to do one more calibration run just to make sure that we really have calibrated our data. We can't afford to make assumptions that aren't true at this point! Until we confirm this, we'll keep characterizing LacI mutants with the old uncalibrated stock.
Good news at the end of the day, we've finally figured out what our old arabinose concentration really was!

--Tuesday 9/20/11--
Now that we have the the real values for our range of arabinose, we can continue to screen our promoter mutants with our new stocks. Today we're going to do a characterization run for LacI mutant #6 (K611026) and start actually characterizing our R0051 and R0040 mutants. We'll start off with R0040 #1, #8, and #9 at the same arabinose levels with which we've been characterizing LacI.
--Wednesday 9/21/11--
We're continuing with our characterization today by doing a run with some of our R0051 mutants (#1, #4, and #5). It looks like the rest of the Tecan runs up to the deadline on the 28th will be characterization runs. We still need to characterize LacI mutant #7 (K611027), pTet #2-#7, and cI lambda #2, #3, and #6-9.
--Thursday 9/22/11--
Characterization is continuing as planned. Today we'll characterize R0051 #2, #6, #7, and #8, and R0040 #2, #5, #6, and #7.
--Friday 9/23/11--
The deadline is approaching quickly! We're putting characterization on hold momentarily to focus on getting parts ready for submission to the registry and to improve our wiki.
--Saturday 9/24/11--
Today was one of the most productive days we've had all year. We all came into lab around 10:00 AM and all stayed until about 11:00 PM. The wiki looks much better than it did at the start of the day, and we almost have all of our parts in pSB1C3.
