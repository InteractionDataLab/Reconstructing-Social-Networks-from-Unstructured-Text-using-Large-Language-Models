iGEM
The iGEM team at UC Davis is rapidly growing and becoming more widely known.  We believe that the iGEM competition is one of the best undergraduate research opportunities around.
On top of providing valuable laboratory experience and showing how cutting edge science is done, iGEM promotes the field of synthetic biology to the public in a positive and exciting way.
