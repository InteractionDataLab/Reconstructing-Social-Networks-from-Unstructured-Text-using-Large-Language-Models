We put a ton of work into this website, and we would like to point out our favorite features to you.
Most notable is our<A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Data_LacI"> LacI Data section.</A> There, you can find our characterization data presented in an interactive widget which allows you to view any combination of mutants against one another and against wild-type. Without our <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/KO3D">KO3D javascript plotting library</A>, the interactive 3D graphing elements of the widget would not be possible.


Another area that we would like to highlight is our<A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Attributions"> attributions</A> page. This page details how we performed all of the work on our project including the wetwork, wiki construction, data analysis, and graphic design. 


We honed our <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project"> Project</A> page to outline the motivation for our project and the way we carried out experiments this summer. 

Lastly, we would like to point out our <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Notebook">Notebook</A> page. It contains accounts of our daily actions as well as a <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Gallery">gallery</A> of photos we took ourselves and step-by-step <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Protocols">protocols</A> for laboratory tasks.

While working on this year's iGEM project, we made sure to fulfill all of the bronze, silver and gold medal requirements. Below you will find the the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Judging" target="_blank">iGEM judging criteria</A> that we have completed over the course of this summer.
</DIV><DIV class="floatbox2"><H2><FONT color="DB9359">Bronze Medal Requirements</FONT></H2><P><B><FONT color="DB9359">Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.</FONT></B></P><DIV class="item">We had our team registered by the start of summer, had a blast working on the project, and can't wait to go to Indianapolis!</DIV><P><B><FONT color="DB9359">Successfully complete and submit the iGEM 2011 Judging form.</FONT></B></P><DIV class="item">We were sure to complete this form on the iGEM website. Additionally, we added this page to our wiki to elaborate on the judging criteria that we believe we have fulfilled.</DIV><P><B><FONT color="DB9359">Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.</FONT></B></P><DIV class="item">Since the first day of summer, we have been working hard to make our wiki as easy to use and as informative as possible. For detailed information about our project, please visit the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Project">project page</A>. Our team has also constructed many useful and unique parts over the summer. A complete <A href="http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2011&amp;group=UC_Davis" target="_blank"> list of new parts </A> from this year is available.</DIV><P><B><FONT color="DB9359">Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.</FONT></B></P><DIV class="item">Just now, as we're finishing up the wiki, we are working on our poster and presentation.

Including: primary nucleaic acid sequence , description of function , authorship, safety notes, acknowledgment of sources and references.</FONT></B></P><DIV class="item">We have constructed many new standard BioBrick parts this summer, all of which have a detailed description on their pages on the parts registry. Here is a link to all of the  <A href="http://partsregistry.org/cgi/partsdb/pgroup.cgi?pgroup=iGEM2011&amp;group=UC_Davis" target="_blank">parts currently on the registry</A>. Some of our favorite parts include our LacI mutants (K611021 through K611027) and our promoter/repressor pair characterization construct (K611018).</DIV><B><FONT color="DB9359">Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.</FONT></B><DIV class="item">The majority of our parts for this year are constructed and are in the proper backbone (pSB1C3). DNA for our characterization plasmids (K611009-K611018), as well as three isolated LacI promoter mutants (K611023, K611025, and K611026), and all of our LacI promoter mutants in their characterization constructs (K611031-K611037) has been shipped to the Registry. We still need to order special primers to PCR out many of our mutants from the characterization plasmids before we can ship the rest of them to the Registry. We plan to have all mutants isolated and sent to the Registry as soon as possible.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="floatbox2"><H2><FONT color="silver">Silver Medal Requirements</FONT></H2><B><FONT color="silver">Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device. Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry</FONT></B><DIV class="item">Our project was centered around the generation and characterization of mutant promoters and repressors. All of the characterization plasmids (K611009-K611014 and K611018) work as designed. These parts allow any user to insert their own promoter or repressor mutants, screen them for mutant activity, and characterize their behavior for various levels of induction. For more detailed descriptions of how the characterization constructs work, see the <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:UC_Davis/Process#construct">process page</A> or the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K611018" target="_blank">part pages</A> on the Registry. With these characterization plasmids, we were able to characterize the mutants generated for our project.</DIV><DIV class="item">The characterization of our mutant promoters is what we view to be the most significant part of our project. We feel that it is very important for parts in the registry to be characterized so that any user could take the parts and confidently use them as desired. Our LacI mutants, K611021-K611027, have been tested at multiple concentrations of LacI repressor and at various levels of IPTG, which derepresses the repressor. Additionally, we have derived relative values for each of our mutants through comparison with the LacI wildtype, R0010. We believe that with the information and characterization available on their registry pages, any user could put our mutants in various circuits with a high level of certainty in the outcome.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="floatbox2"><H2><FONT color="gold">Gold Medal Requirements</FONT></H2><B><FONT color="gold">Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.</FONT></B><DIV class="item">One of our biggest contributions to the synthetic biology community this year is our improvement of the LacI promoter, R0010. We have significantly widened the functionality of this part by adding 7 new and well characterized mutants to the registry (K611021-K611027). Each variant is different and useful in its own way, with altered characteristics such as promoter strength or repressor binding affinity. The LacI promoter and it's corresponding repressor (C0012) are two of the most commonly used parts in all of synthetic biology and having many variants of the same repressible promoter opens up a range of circuits that would be have been more difficult to create before. Additionally, these parts enable any user that wants to use a LacI repressible promoter to choose from a wide range of expression levels, rather than being limited to the wild type. To read more about how our team used and improved R0010, please take a look at the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0010:Experience">experience page</A>.</DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
