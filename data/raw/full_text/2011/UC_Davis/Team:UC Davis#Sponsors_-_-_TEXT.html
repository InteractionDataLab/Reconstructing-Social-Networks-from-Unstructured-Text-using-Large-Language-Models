Sponsors
We would like to thank our sponsors for making this project possible. We started off the year barely enough enough funding to afford reagents, and it is only through the generosity of our supporters that we finished our project at all (let alone on time!) and are able to fly the team to compete this Fall. We couldn't have done it without you!
Novozymes provided generous monetary support both for our project and for the DTU Denmark team.
The UC Davis College of Biological Sciences provided us with a generous monetary donation.
The UC Davis College of Engineering provided us with monetary support on behalf of the Student Project Funding Committee.
The UC Davis Genome Center provided monetary backing for our project.
Fisher Scientific donated reagents, plasticware and other laboratory supplies to our project.
The UC Davis Department of Biomedical Engineering provided us with departmental funding.
