After the Jamboree
The UC Davis team is proud to have come back from the iGEM Americas Jamboree with a gold medal and an invitation to the world championships! We have a lot of work that we would like to before the next jamboree. Our main focus has been to polish our part family expansion protocol so that other groups can utilize it to create their own part families and help expand the registry. We're currently constructing part families for the TetR and cI lambda promoters and hope to get them on the registry soon. We have also been working hard to improve KO3D, our interactive, cross-platform javascript plotting library. We hope to package KO3D so that it can be easily used by any team to plot their data. In the near future, we would like to see KO3D being used to plot part data on the registry itself.
