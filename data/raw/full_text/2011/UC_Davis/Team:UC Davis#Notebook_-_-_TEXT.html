Notebook
Welcome to our notebook. Here, you may will find summaries of our progress, pictures from throughout the summer, and information on the protocols we use in our lab.
You may select a week above to travel directly to it, or begin at Week 1 here .
If you're interested in what we've been up to since the first jamboree, you can see our progress here .
Gallery
We have a ton of photos in our gallery that didn't end up being used elsewhere on the website, including a few that were too silly to post anywhere else. Check them out here .
Protocols
Looking for the mix for our mutagenic PCR protocol? Performing a ligation and you're not sure how much vector to use? Check out our Protocols page for step-by-step instructions on how to replicate our experiments.
