Welcome
Welcome to iGEM 2011 at UC Davis!
The four of us have been hard at work on this year's project. We've fine tuned a powerful (and simple) part family generation process, and used it to expand the functionality of the LacI promoter, R0010. We also mutated GFP!
In addition, we developed KO3D , an interactive, cross-platform javascript plotting library for displaying scientific data on the web in 3D.
We had a great time at the regional competition in Indianapolis and look forward to seeing all of the other teams at the World Championship at MIT!
Our Project
This is the third time a team at UC Davis has competed in the iGEM Jamboree. This year, we are focusing on foundational advances for BioBrick circuit synthesis. Part families, groups of parts with a unified function and differeing characteristics, are some of the most useful parts of the registry. Our project aims to streamline the process of expanding basic parts into part families, from promoters to protein-coding genes.
We set out to create useful mutant libraries of commonly used parts, starting with the repressible LacI promoter. You can read more about our project here.
We think that thorough characterization should be a priority for all parts submitted to the registry . You can view information about our project here . You can also review our characterization process and characterization data for LacI on our data page.
Make Your Own Part Family
Our part family expansion process turns basic parts into part families. Check out how easy it is to improve your favorite BioBricks! You can also listen to Nick and Aaron discuss the process on our Soundcloud page.
Team
The team page has information on the four undergrads that make up this year's team, their advisors, as well as contact information for getting in touch with us.
Safety
Our safety page discusses the potential impact of our project on environmental, public, and researcher safety. It also contains our answers to the iGEM 2011 safety questionnaire.
Notebook
The notebook page contains daily updates about our progress in lab, and also has a gallery where you can view pictures that we've taken in our lab.
