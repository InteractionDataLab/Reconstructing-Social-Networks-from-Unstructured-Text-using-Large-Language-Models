Error-Prone PCR
This PCR protocol generally introduces between one and seven mutations (i.e. single base substitutions) per 1000 bases of template DNA. This is due to an increase in the magnesium chloride concentration, the addition of manganese chloride, the low template concentration, an unbalanced solution of dNTPS (that is, A,G,C, and T are not all present at the same concentration) and the use of Taq polyermase without an error-checking enzyme.
Prepare Unbalanced DNTP Mix:
20uL dATP
20uL dGTP
100uL dCTP
100uL dTTP
260uL H2O
(Store at -20 C)
Create a Mutant PCR Mix using:
5ul 10x buffer
2.5ul Unbalanced DNTPs
1ul Forward primer
1ul Reverse primer
10uL 25 mM MgCl2
7.5uL 1 mM MnCl2
22.4ul dH2O
These values can be multiplied by 5x, 10x or however much you like, so long as the mixture is stored at -20C. Aliquot 49.4 uL of this solution into a PCR tube per each reaction and add:
0.1ul Template
.5ul Taq
Mix the reaction thoroughly and place it in a thermal cycler. You can use the same program that you would for a conventional PCR reaction, with run times appropriate for the length of your template. We used around twenty cycles and an elongation time of 30 seconds for our promoter mutants, which took only a few hours to complete per cycle.
To increase the mutation rate, dilute the results of one error-prone PCR reaction by roughly 100x and repeat the process, using the new product as template. This will increase the number of mutations per 1000 base pairs accordingly -- after three rounds, our LacI promoter mutants showed between 1 and 7 mutations per 300 bases.
Nanodrop
Log in to nanodrop program.
Moisten a Kim wipe and clean the pedestal.
Apply 2ul H2O to pedestal and click 'OK'.
Press 'Blank' button.
Wipe blank from pedestal using Kim wipe.
Apply 2ul of desired sample to pedestal.
Click 'measure'.
Print results.
Glycerol Stock
Make liquid culture of desired cell strain. Grow for 12-16hrs if using Dh5a.
Mix 800ul of grown liquid culture with 800ul of 80% glycerol. Shake with vigor.
Flash freeze using liquid nitrogen.
Keep at -80C
Note: When streaking plates from glycerol stock, it is important to leave glycerol stock tube on dry ice.
PCR Purification
For every volume of PCR product, add 2 volumes Binding Buffer.  (ex. add 100ul Binding Buffer to 50ul PCR reaction)
Transfer to spin column and spin for 1 minute.
Discard flowthrough.
Add 500ul Wash Buffer and spin for 1 minute.
Discard flowthrough.
Spin for 2 minutes.
Put spin column in clean 1.5ml tube and elute with desired volume.
Registry Part Distribution Rehydration
Procedure
Add 20ul sterile H2O to desired well in distribution plate.
Incubate at room temperature for ~10 minutes.
Transfer resuspension to microcentrifuge tube.
Making Competent Cells
Materials
0.5M PIPES buffer (piperazine-1,2-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid])(pH 6.7)
Dissolve 15.1g of PIPES in 80ml of pure H2O.  Adjust to pH 6.7 with 5M KOH and bring volume to 100ml with pure H2O.  Filter sterilize and store at -20C
Inoue transformation buffer
Dissolve 10.88g McCl2.4H2O, 2.20g CaCl2.2H2O, 18.65g KCl, and 20ml PIPES in 800ml pure H2O and fill to 1L
Filter sterilize and store at -20C
DMSO
Procedure
Starting around noon, pick a single bacterial colony (2-3mm in diameter) from a plate that has incubated for 16-20hrs at 37C.  Transfer colony into 25ml of LB medium in a 250ml flask.  Incubate for 6-8hrs at 37C with vigorous shaking.
At about 6:00pm, use the starter culture to inoculate three 1L flasks each containing 250ml LB.  The first flask receives 6ml of starter culture, the second receives 4ml, and the third receives 2ml.  Incubate all three flasks at 18-22C overnight with moderate shaking.
The following morning, read the OD600 of all three cultures monitoring every 45 minutes.
When one of the cultures reaches an OD600 of 0.55, transfer the culture vessel to an ice-water bath for 10 minutes.  Discard the other cultures unless you desire to do multiple batches at once.
Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2500g (3900rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor) for 10 minutes at 4C.
Pour off the medium and store the open centrifuge bottle on a stack of paper towels for 2 minutes.  Use a vacuum aspirator to remove any drops of remaining medium adhering to walls of the centrifuge bottle or trapped in its neck.
Resuspend the cells gently in 80ml of ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer.
Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 2500g for 10 minutes at 4C
Pour off the medium and store the open centrifuge tube on a stack of paper towels for 2 minutes.  Again, use the vacuum aspirator to remove any drops.
Resuspend the cells gently in 20ml of ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer.
Add 1.5ml of DMSO.  Mix the bacterial suspension by swirling and then store it in ice for 10 minutes.
Working quickly, dispense aliquots of the suspensions into chilled, sterile microcentrifuge tubes.  Immediately snap-freeze the competent cells by immersing the tightly closed tubes in a bath of liquid nitrogen.  Store the tubes at -80C until needed for transformation.
