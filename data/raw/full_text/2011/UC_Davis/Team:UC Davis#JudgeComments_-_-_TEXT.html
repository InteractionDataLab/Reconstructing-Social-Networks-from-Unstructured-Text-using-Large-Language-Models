Comments for the iGEM Judges
Thank you for taking the time to explore our wiki.
We put a ton of work into this website, and we would like to point out our favorite features to you.
Most notable is our LacI Data section. In here you can find our hard data presented in an original widget that allows you to view any combination. The real-time graphing in 2D and 3D is something that you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. We're particularly proud of this.
Another area that we would like to highlight is our Attributions page. This page details how we performed all of the work on our project including the wetwork, coding of our wiki and data analysis, and graphic design.
