Title: De Novo Adaptation of Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1 Defense in E. coli
Abstract:
The ultimate goal of our project was to utilize this system as a mobile gene targeting system capable of eliminating antibiotic resistance. The protoype construct, pSTINGER, was designed for quantitative modeling, proof of concept, and vaccination on a single plasmid. As a result of experimental error, intellectual property agreements, material availability, our biobrick constructs remain experimentally theoretical, though we have rigorously modeled our system in various scenarios.
