Joaquin Ariño and Asier Gonzalez ( Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Celular ), Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona. These project wouldn't have been possible without the continuos help and support of the group of Joaquin Ariño in UAB (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona). The paper 'Characterization of the Calcium-mediated Response to Alkaline Stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae' by Viladevall, et al, has been our bible during these months. Asier and Joaquin have been extremely kind and have always helped us with the protocol, our results or even emotinal support when things didn't go as expected. Again, without them this project wouldn't have been possible.

Sergi Morais Ezquerro, Ángel Maquieira Català and Miguel Ángel González Martínez. Mesuring luminiscense was hard and nearly impossible without the help of the Instituto de química molecular aplicada (Applied Molecular Chemistry Institute). They let us use their two luminometers and for the first time we saw the light. We have been more than a month in their laboratory, using their equipment and tools, and they have been always there to help us when we had problems.
Raquel Galian. Back when we didn't have our amazing results, we had to look for a suitable mesuring device. Raquel let us the spectoflurimeter, helped us with its function and maintenance and cheer us up when we were down.
Irene Murillo helped us with our coelenterazine dissolutions and always welcomed us with a huge smile.
