Synthetic Biology is a revolutionary scientific discipline. The ability to design and construct new biological systems with useful properties opens up a challenging scenario for the technological development of humanity. However, new science needs new regulation, and Human Practices dealing with Synthetic Biology are needed in order to have an ethical, legal and regulatory framework allowing the development of this novel scientific area.
Sins, Ethics and Biology, a Comprehensive Approach is more than a review on Human Practices and Synthetic Biology: it emcompasses a classical review of scientific reports on Human Practices; the first comparative analysis of previous iGEM HP projects; interviews with well known experts; and the largest survey on ethics and synthetic biology ever made.
Sins, Ethics And Biology - A Comprehensive Approach
The complete report will be edited as a book and you will be able to get it at bubok.com (more information coming soon) oras a free pdf file and its goal is to help researchers and people interested in SB to assess the new risks, possibilities, and ethical issues of this discipline.
