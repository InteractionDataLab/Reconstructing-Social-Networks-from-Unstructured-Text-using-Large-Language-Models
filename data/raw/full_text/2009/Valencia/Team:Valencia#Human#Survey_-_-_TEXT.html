The Survey: With more than 1200 answers we have made the largest survey on Synthetic Biology of the history. It was adressed to a very different public including scientific and no scientific people, people from inside and outside the iGEM, and Students and Teachers from all over the world. To encourage iGEM participants to fill our survey we prepared medals that teams can show in their wiki according to their degree of participation. This Survey has also helped us to get the largest collection of Synthetic Biology's definitions.
