Simulations
Here you have a "demo" where you can see our system's response with differents parameters (a further explanation is available below):

Our Simulations
Before simulating how intracellular calcium concentration changes in time, we have approximated the excitatory post-synaptic potential function (our "input" in neurons) as follows:
Then, taking into account all the factors listed in Our Model (Calcium current through VDCCs, Calcium Buffering and Calcium pumps), the result of simulating free intracellular calcium concentration after the electrical stimulation in neurons is this:
On the other hand, cardiomyocytes have a different response to an electrical stimulus, as now our “input” voltage function is different: unlike neurons, its plasma membrane is held at a high voltage for a few hundred milliseconds.
The numeric values for the simulation parameters are shown in the following table:
