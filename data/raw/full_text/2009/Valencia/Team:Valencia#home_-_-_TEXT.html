Project description
Engineered yeasts able to sense and respond to electrical signals are build (what we call LEC). Thanks to a homemade device these LECs work cooperatively  in such a way that they are able to reproduce images in movement, building up a "bio-screen" for the first time in history.
"As Lumières revolutioned the photography world, Valencia Team revolutions the bacterial photography world"
Human Practices Report
Sins, Ethics and Biology, a Comprehensive Approach is more than a review on Human Practices and Synthetic Biology it emcompasses:
Classical review revising more than 50 scientific reports on Human Practices.
The first comparative analysis of previous iGEM HP projects.
Interviews with well known experts.
The largest survey on ethics and synthetic biology ever made.
Valencia Team
Integrated by students from the two main Valencia Universities ( UPV and UV ).
We gathered an eminent multidisciplinary group:
4 Biologist, 3 Mechanical Engineers and 2 Biotech
With a great repercusion in the national media !
Acknowledgements
This work has not been possible without the help of several Institutions and Research groups.
From Valencia Team, we would like to thank to all that people that allow us to pass this summer working on this mind-blowing project
