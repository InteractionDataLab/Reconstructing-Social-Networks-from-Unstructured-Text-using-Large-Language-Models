Project description
Engineered yeasts able to sense and respond to electrical signals are build (what we call LEC). Thanks to a homemade device These LECs work cooperatively in such a way that they are able to reproduce images in movement, building up a "bio-screen" for the first time in history.
LEC construction.
LEC characterization.
LEC Integration in the first iLCD.
Human Practices report
Sins, Ethics and Biology, a Comprehensive Approach is more than a review on Human Practices and Synthetic Biology: it emcompasses a classical review of scientific reports on Human Practices; the first comparative analysis of previous iGEM HP projects; interviews with well known experts; and the largest survey on ethics and synthetic biology ever made.
Our Team
Integrated by students from the two main Valencia Universities (UPV and UV). Emiment multidisciplinary group:
4 Biologist
3 Mechanical Engineers
2 Biotech
With a great repercusion in the national media!
