it is the combination of biology and engineering which synthesis some biological products or systems  Changing or creating new biological systems or processes
To be able to create smaller component parts of the genomic world that can radically alter the abilities of a cell to accomplish specified tasks.
Synthetic Biology, an intertwining of principles from Biology and Engineering Constructing new biological parts from existing ones Design. construction and standardization of biological parts. Biological Engineering "the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. " The reduction of an array of molecular biology techniques into a standardized set of common practices designed to streamline modern molecular biology.
Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems which are either novel to the natural world or are modifications based on existing biological systems. The goal is to program organisms to perform specific functions.
applying engineering principles to solving biological problems
field involved in the engineering of biological parts, devices and systems by standardizing DNA sequence information for reuse in designs
a way to build new biological systems
Engineering biology from the ground up.
The use biotechnology in a consistent and systematic way to engineer modified organisms with relative ease (as compared to traditional biotechnological methods).
It involves designing and modeling biological systems
It is a magic field of study where we can design an artificial genetic network to endow novel biological and non-biological functions to microbes!
synthbio can be boiled down to the creation of biological parts and systems.
design and build novel biological functions and systems
design of novel and new biological parts or devices
using advanced genetic components and technologies to create new parts or functions in a creature
design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems
design and creation of new biological parts
It is the emerging discipline which seeks to standardize biology and unlock the potential of new technologies which allow the de novo synthesis of biological components.
Engineering approach to biology
genetically modify a bacteria, virus or other organisms to create a something new with a specialized function, which can help our life in some way.
a method that allows for better engineering of biology/life
Synthetic Biology is
A) the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and
B) the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes, According to http://syntheticbiology.org/ and I agree with this definition.
Adding new genes or circuits to cells to achieve new behaviors and properties from those organisms.
A nes research field where it is combine the biological and engineering knowledge
Engineering biology
The design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes
The essay to create a functional biological system, starting with the smallest parts
Synthetic Biology is
A) the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and
B) the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.
How to apply engineering in cells
Studying Protein design and trying to optimize it by genetical means. Also designing new functions for organisms is called synthetic biology
Synthetic biology is genetic engineering on a larger scale, involving editing of genes, building entire systems, synthesis of dna, and application of engineering methods to genetic modification.
designing biological systems that are not already in nature.
standarized parts,  new functions, quatative analysis, model
transfer of gens from cell 1 into cell 2, the trying to creat new products any kind (enzyms, cells, pathways) build new biological systems
Engineering genes of biological systems to add to their way of everyday living.
engineering / programming life
The synthetic biology aims to build new biological parts for the creation of new genes and in the future whole genoms.
This will provide new opportunities in medicin, biochemics and engineering.
Creating artificial biological systems
Hm, I would say sort of designing new molecules, new biochemical pathways or even organisms ('minimal cells') etc. which don´t exist in nature.
the redesign of natural biological parts to perform a new useful task
