Project description
The iGEM Valencia Lighting Cell Display (iLCD) is our project for the present iGEM competition. We are developing a “bio-screen” of voltage-activated cells, where every “cellular pixel” produces light.
It is known that for instance neurons, cardiomyocites or muscle cells are able to sense and respond to electrical signals. These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several disadvantadges in order to make use of them from the technological point of view:
- Get easily contaminated.
- Genetic manipulation is complicated and expensive.
- To be very sensible to external conditions.
Valencia team uses this sensibility of calcium channel to  electricity to produce yeast luminiscence as a response to electrical estimulous. This project constitutes the FIRST TIME in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested building the first LEC (Light Emitting Cell). The obtained device will be used to build the first iLCD in history.
Therefore, the project is divided in several stages from the fabrication of the first LEC up to the cooperative integration of various LECs in the first iLCD. The global scheme of the project is summarized in the scheme of the figure:

LEC Characterization
LEC Integration Device
The main advantages of using electrical signals instead of chemical stimulation, as in the Coliroid project (Levskaya et al, Synthetic biology: Engineering Escherichia coli to see light. Nature 438, 441-442),  are reversibility and high frequency: the system can go back to the resting state and it will take milliseconds to refresh an image, actually showing animated pictures!.
iLCD will be a major advance in Synthetic Biology, opening the field of Green Electronics, integrating electrical signals with cell behaviours. This will reduce the response time of the cells to the activation signal by up to two orders of magnitude, as well as foster the combination of Electronics and Biology.
See the Notebook and News and stay tuned for news and progresses!!!
