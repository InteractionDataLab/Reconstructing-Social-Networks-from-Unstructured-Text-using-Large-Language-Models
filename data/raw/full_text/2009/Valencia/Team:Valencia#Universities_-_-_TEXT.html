Two leading groups form different areas have gathered together in this current iGEM competition.
Evolutionary genetics' group at Cavanilles Institute for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology from the Universidad de Valencia aims at studying biology at its furthermost frontier: from evolutuionary genetics of endosimbiotic bacteria to bioinformatics and theoretical biology, the group's interest spans many different biological areas. Leaded by Andres Moya, they already have an experience combining reasearch from genetics, biochemistry, evolutionary biology, molecular biology and informatics. Few members of this group participating at TARPOL Consortium .
Intertech is a mixed scientific group form the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and the Universidad de Valencia . Intertech is headed by three professors that have interests in Mathematics (Pedro Fernández de Córdoba), Engineering (Javier Urchueguía) and Photonics (Albert Ferrando). More interestingly, they have a common aim at finding scientific spaces where those three areas overlap, using 'interdisciplinarity' not just as a word, but as a proper scientific area. Few members of this group participating at TARPOL Consortium .
