UVic
This is the first year that the University of Victoria has entered the iGEM competition. Our core team this year is a group of five students who are enrolled in a directed studies course under the supervision of Dr. Nano and Dr. Upton. There are also a number of other students involved, but who are not taking the directed studies course. Our lab notebook, ideas brainstorming, and progress can currently be found at igem-victoria.pbworks.com
Our Project
We are designing a NAND logic gate using the ribokey/ribolock system designed by the 2006 Berkeley team. This system should constitutively produce RFP except when the cells are grown in the presence of both arabinose and IPTG.
We are also coupling flourescent outputs with the ribothermometers made by the 2008 TUDelft team.
