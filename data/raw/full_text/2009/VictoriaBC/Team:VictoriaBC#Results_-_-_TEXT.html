RESULTS
Disappointing results from the fluorescence microscope: none of the temperature sensitive parts were working. However, the lac regulated GFP (K235032) did have some fluorescence. An interesting outcome is that the trials with IPTG seemed to have slightly less fluorescence than those without, which was the reverse of our expectations.

Negative control to account for microscope artifacts - there is no colour producing part at all.

This is as expected.
