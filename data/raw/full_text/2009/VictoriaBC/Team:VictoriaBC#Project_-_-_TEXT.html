Signal Integration: Applications of RNA Riboregulator Capabilities
Abstract:
This project explores some of the ways that the secondary structure of messenger RNA can be used to control the rate of protein expression. The 32oC ribothermometer made by the 2008 TUDelft team will be coupled to fluorescent proteins to visually confirm temperature-dependent translation. The "ribolock" made by the 2006 Berkeley team will be tested at various temperatures to determine if it could double for use as a ribothermometer. Finally, a proof-of-concept NAND logic gate will be constructed: a ribolock will be used to interpret two concurrent environmental signals into an on/off control for mCherry output.
Safety Considerations
   1. None of our project ideas raise any safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety.
   2. There is a Biosafety Commitee at the University of Victoria, which can be found at http://ohs.uvic.ca/biosafety/index.html .
   3. Our project raised no issues as it did not involve any dangerous organisms, genes, or materials.
   4. None of the new biobrick parts we made this year raise any safety issues.
