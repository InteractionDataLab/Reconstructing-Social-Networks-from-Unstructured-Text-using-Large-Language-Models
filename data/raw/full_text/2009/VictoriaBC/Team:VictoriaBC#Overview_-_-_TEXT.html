OVERVIEW
Our project has gone through different stages as we found out what actually worked and what didn't.  We started with our NAND gate project but were stalled when we failed to get a lambda cI promoter working.  We then focused on a limited version of the bio-thermometer project .  Unfortunately this ran out of time before it could be completed.
In the end, two basic thermometer parts (K235034 and K235035) were assembled and tested, however they did not display any fluorescence at all.  There was not time before the competition to make another attempt, nor to analyse what may have gone wrong.
The most successful part was K235032, a lactose promoter regulated GFP part, which did display green fluorescence when tested.
