CONCLUSIONS
Although there was not time to conclusively test the ribothermometer parts, both green and red fluorescence were produced.  Additionally, green fluorescence was produced under the control of a lactose promoter (K235032).
FUTURE WORK
Our suggestions for future iGEM teams include the completion of the NAND gate, and further attempts to digest and ligate component parts for K235036 and K235037 and then K235034 and K235035.  While we had developed regular RBS controls for parts K235034-37, we did not have time to assemble them and these would be necessary for testing once the parts were properly assembled.
