Still not seeing visible BFP
Today
Ordered Arsenic binding peptide (ABP) as pair of oligos
BB prefix & suffix
Two repeats of CCGCG (Cys-Cys-Gly-Cys-Gly) with Lys-Gly-His linkers after each
Complete AA sequence: CCGCGKGHCCGCGKGH
Complete DNA sequence: gaattcgcggccgcttctagATGTGTTGTGGTTGCGGTAAAGGTCATTGTTGTGGTTGTGGTAAAGGTCATtactagtagcggccgctgcag
Getting quote for PCS in DNA 2.0's pJ express in-house expression vector.
with BB suffix, no BB prefix
Can add the prefix later with PCR, but its stop codon would interfere with expression
