Helping other Teams
We helped the Brown University team by supplying them with BBa_K156010 as the version supplied by the registry did not seem functional.
The VCU team visited us here in Charlottesville, Va. on Oct 18, 2009 for a joint practice presentation session. Both teams received invaluable feedback on their projects and improved inter-university relations!
