Welcome
  In this sub-project, we are constructing a chimeric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) to be functionally expressed in the heterologous yeast system. The yeast pheromone sensing pathway is used and adapted to express our odorant receptor. We have demonstrated that this engineered receptor could response to a volatile molecule, and in principle showed that this method could potentially be applied to other insect odorant receptors.
