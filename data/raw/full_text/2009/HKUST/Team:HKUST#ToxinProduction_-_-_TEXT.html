In this sub-project, we are going to engineer a yeast strain which can produce a certain toxin. We have planned to clone the mosquito-larvicidal binary toxin genes in the expression vector pESC-Leu into S. cerevisiae. In that case, the binary toxin proteins can be continuously expresses in yeast under the promoters GAL10 and GAL1. Later we could potentially use this strain to kill agricultural pests or disease vectors.
