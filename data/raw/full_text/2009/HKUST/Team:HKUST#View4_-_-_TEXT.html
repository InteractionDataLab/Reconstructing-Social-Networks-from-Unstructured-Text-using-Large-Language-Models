Welcome
In this sub-project, we are going to engineer a yeast strain able to produce a kind of toxin. We have designed to clone the mosquito-larvicidal binary toxin genes in the expression vector pESC-Leu into the yeast. In that case, it can continuously express binary toxin proteins under the promoter GAL10 and GAL1. Later we could potentially use this strain to kill some disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and fleas, or as a pesticide in agriculture.
