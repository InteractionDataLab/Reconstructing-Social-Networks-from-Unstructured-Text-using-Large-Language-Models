Constructs
We have successfully cloned the FUS1t gene into the multiple cloning site of the vector pRS426. Agarose gel electrophoresis shows correct sizes after enzyme digestion of pRS426-tFUS1. The other parts, the FUS1 promoter and the EGFP gene are still under construction.  Also, the ARO9 gene has been amplified from the yeast genome.
