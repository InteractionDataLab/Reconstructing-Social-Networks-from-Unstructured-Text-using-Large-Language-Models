In this sub-project, we are constructing a chimeric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) to be functionally expressed in the heterologous yeast system. The yeast pheromone sensing pathway is used and adapted to couple to our odorant receptor. We have demonstrated that this engineered receptor could respond to a volatile molecule, and in principle showed that this method could potentially be applied to other insect odorant receptors.
