Welcome
Hi folks!
Welcome to our team wiki!
We are the 2009 iGEM team from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) .This is our 2nd year to join the competition. Following last year's experience of producing meaningful biological products - creating real and controllable randomness from our nature, we are now presenting how we can improve our environment by making a new type of bio-pesticide, yet this time it is totally environmental friendly!
The logo below shows our idea: No more drosophilae! Let's enjoy our wikipage and see how we achieve it!
