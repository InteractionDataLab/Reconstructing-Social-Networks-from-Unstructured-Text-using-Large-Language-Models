Cutting bands on the gel
Purpose: To extract specific DNA fragment.
Procedure:
a.Visualize the bands under UV light. Use long-wavelength UV to minimize damage to the DNA.
b.Cut the band with a clean razor blade.
c.Turn the gel slice on its side to trim off extra agarose. Place the gel in a microcentrifuge tube.
Tips:
EB staining is needed for higher resolution under UV light.
Safety tips:
1. ermission is needed from technician before doing this! Follow the safety instruction in the room.
2.When using UV light, protect your skin by wearing safety goggles or a face shield, gloves, and a lab coat.
