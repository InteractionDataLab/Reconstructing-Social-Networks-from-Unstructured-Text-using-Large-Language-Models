Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:  researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
A.              All of our bacterial strains are designated at Biosafety Level 1, however P. aeurginosa is an opportunistic contaminant in immunocompromised individuals.  Luckily for CCSF, no one working in our lab was immunocompromised.  We do not foresee any threat posed to the public or to the environment by our project.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
A.              Yes, in a sense.  We have two lab managers who have both reviewed our project.  They have made recommendations to us in the past on safety issues and required a safety training session be attended before lab work begun.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
A.              See #2.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
A.              No.
