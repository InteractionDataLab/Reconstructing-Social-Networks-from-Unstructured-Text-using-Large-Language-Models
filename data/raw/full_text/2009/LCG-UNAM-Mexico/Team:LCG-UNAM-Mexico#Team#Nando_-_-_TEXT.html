Nando
Hi there!! I am Luis Fernando, one of the wetlabbers for LCG UNAM. About me? I can say that I’ve got a disease called “chronic insatisfaction”, what makes me start doing crazy stuff as it makes me change and upgrade myself. I hope it will be useful for the team!! Music is part of my mind and body, so I love living it at its best and eating nice food of any kind!!Long Live iGEM and the LCG UNAM Team!!!
