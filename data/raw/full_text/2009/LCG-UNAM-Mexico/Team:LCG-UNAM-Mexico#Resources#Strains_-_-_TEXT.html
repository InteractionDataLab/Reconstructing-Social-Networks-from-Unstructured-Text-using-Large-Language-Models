E. coli Strains
Strains handed by Giuseppe Bertani
C-1a.- Main strain for working with phage P2 and P4. This is also the mother strain for all the  modified phage-containing derivatives. Its genetic map is really close to E. coli K12 "pop" strain. Its genome is being sequenced.
C-117.- Lysogenic for P2
C-1906.- Lysogenic for P4.
Strains handed by Richard Calendar
C-331 /arg/-am/1/ /tonA-trp/D, str-r (P2) (P4 /imp/). The abbreviation "imp" means "improved plaques."
C-520 F^+ /supD60/, used for growth and plaque assay of P2.
C-1895 F^+ /supD60/ (P2 /lg/), which we use to grow and sometimes assay for P4. The symbol "lg" denotes large plaques.
C-2423 /trp/-am /arg/-am/1/ str-r (P2 /lg/ del/1/). This strain is used to get the best P4 plaques. The symbol del1 denotes a
deletion of the /old /gene, which interferes with the growth of phage lambda and kills /recB-/ bacteria.
Strain variants obtained in our lab
C-1895 sp+.- this slow-growing strain can be used for obtaining an excelent stock of P4 sid1
Expression Strains
BL21(DE3)pLysS from novagen: widely used for protein expression deficient in lon and ompT proteases. It has a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase and T7 lysozyme for suppression o basal expression of T7 RNA polymerase and avoid as much as possible cell growth and viability affection.
Yeast strains
TERRIBLY, UNCOUNTABLE, PERSISTENT and ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT!!!
