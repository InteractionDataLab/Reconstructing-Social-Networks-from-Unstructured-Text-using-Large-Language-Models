The Project
Bacteriophage infection represents an interesting process in science and industry. The idea of being able to contend at a population level with such infections is the main motivation of the development of our project.
We plan to modify an Escherichia coli phage in order to deliver genetic material codifying for a construction against other phages, taking advantage of some of their own properties!!! The purpose of this construction is to make a bacterial to fight back against the spreading of some phage by triggering on a cellular death response when a cell encounters a specific component of the phage. Such response will be faster than the formation process of viral particles preventing the death of the bacterial population.
This population resistance can be seen as a sort of "vaccine" that will hold back the process of infection. The design of the delivery system includes the use the P4 phage and its auxiliary genes present in the P2 helper phage. In the case of the "vaccine" construct, the cellular death response will be induced by the presence of T3 or T7 RNA polymerases which will also turn on the transcription of toxines used for the degradation of DNA and RNA to stop the phage´s genetic material from assembling and scattering in the environment.
Furthermore, we will implement a stochastic population model based on the basic properties of the bacterial cells and the phages such as movement, reproduction, etc., this will allow us to simulate the infection processes and quantify the efficiency of our system. A possible extention of the system includes the expansion of an AHL signal through the quorum sensing system of Vibrio fischeri in which the population will be "warned" to prepare against the viral infection in the presence of T3 or T7.
About us
Hi, welcome to our site! We are students from the undergraduate program in Genomic Sciences which is part of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. We are working on the official version of the wiki. Here you will find advances and general information about our project.
