BBa_K242000
Part name:
Colicin E3 rRNAse domain
Description:
Colicin E3 is a bacteriocin targeting 16S rRNA in the 30S subunit at a single and specific site near to the 3' terminus. We extracted the ribonuclease domain which is enough for degrading RNA. Inhibited when Im3 is present.
Length:
343 bp
Designed by:
Jesus Abraham Avelar Rivas, Willebaldo Garcia Muñoz
BBa_K242001
Part name:
Phage P2 cox transcriptional activator
Description:
Cox (Control of excision) is a coliphage P2 key regulator in charge of activating P4 Pll promoter, which leads transcription of the P4 replication operon. Another function for cox, hence its name, is to repress the activation of the inmunity repressor, which participates in P2 late gene induction, necessary for complete assembly of P4 viral particles.
Length:
294 bp
Designed by:
Luis Fernando Montaño Gutierrez
BBa_K242006
Part name:
P4 and P2 transactivators (cox & ogr)
Description:
Length:
677bp
Designed by:
Jose Maria Uriel Urquiza Garcia
BBa_K242052
Part name:
RFP+Kanamycin+Ter
Description:
One marker for negative selection and one funny reporter of expression RFP.
Length:
2181 bp
Designed by:
Enrique Paz
BBa_K242101
Part name:
GFP induced by T7/T3 RNA polymerases
Description:
The detection of the RNA polymerases from both T3 or T7 bacteriophages will make the cells containing this biobrick to express GFP.
Length:
841 bp
Designed by:
Laura Gomez/Uriel Urquiza
BBa_K242200
Part name:
Colicin E3 rRNAse domain
Description:
Colicin E3 is a bacteriocin targeting 16S rRNA in the 30S subunit at a single and specific site near to the 3' terminus. We extracted the ribonuclease domain which is enough for degrading RNA. Inhibited when Im3 is present.
Length:
343 bp
Designed by:

BBa_K242201
Part name:
Colicin E9 DNAse domain
Description:
Colicin E9 is able to degrade DNA. This DNase domain extracted by us is enough to get this function. It is inhibited in the presence of its immunity protein 9.
Length:
431 bp
Designed by:
Jesus Abraham Avelar Rivas
BBa_K242250
Part name:
antisense RNA targeting replication machineries of T3 and T7 bacteriophages
Description:
It contains two antisense RNAs targeting 5' region of genes involved in DNA replication in bacteriophages T3 and T7. The first part is targeting T3 DNA polymerase, the second is to traductionaly regulate the production of the protein Gp2.5 which is a ssDNA binding protein essential for replication.
Length:
153 bp
Designed by:
Promoters and regulatory parts
BBa_K242003
Part name:
POgr. Promoter induced by Ogr.
Description:
Promoter with Binding site for the Ogr gene product. Ogr binding to Po Promotes the transcription of the downstream gene.
Length:
71 bp
Designed by:
Jesus Abraham Avelar Rivas
BBa_K242004
Part name:
Operator binding site for Cox
Description:
This is the operator that enhances the transcription of those transcripts with the promoter PLL downstream when the Cox protein is in its binding site.It should be placed 55bp upstream of the transcription iniciation.
Length:
91 bp
Designed by:
Jesus Abraham Avelar Rivas
BBa_K242100
Part name:
T3 and T7 RNA polymerase promoter. (multipromoter sequence)
Description:
T7 early promoters are strongly recognized by the phage’s polymerases and are weakly recognized by the Escherichia’s coli polymerase.
Length:
76 bp
Designed by:
Jesus Abraham Avelar Rivas
Primers
Composite
BBa_K242150
Part name:
(no promoter - AHL) + (ptet - luxR) + (quorum sensing inducible RFP)
Description:
The idea for this part is the chance to ligate any promoter before the AHL making enzyme to activate the quorum sensing device. Then we have constitutive transcription of LuxR and RFP activated by AHL-LuxR as a reporter.
Length:
2738 bp
Designed by:
Enrique Paz
BBa_K242151
Part name:
lacI promoter + lux I + TER + ptet-luxR-TER + lux pR - RFP
Description:
Quorum sensing device under lacI promoter. The sistem will induce RFP transcription under IPTG.
Length:
2946 bp
Designed by:
Enrique Paz
Others
BBa_K242050
Part name:
cos-containing P4 DNA fragment
Description:
This DNA fragment contains the cos region of bacteriophage P4. This region consist in the cohesive ends and the region flanking these ends that is involved in DNA packaging inside the capsid.
Having a plasmid inside E. Coli with this cos site while a coinfection of the cell with P2 and P4 will result in packaging of those plasmids inside a capsid and production of P2 and P4 phages.
Length:
320 bp
Designed by:
Enrique Paz
BBa_K242051
Part name:
Essential region of P4 bacteriophage genome
Description:
Bacteriophage P4 genome without the non-essential region nor the integrase gene. The use of this part is similar to a plasmid. You can clone standard parts in this viral vector. You can use this vector with a system for P4 production to encapsidate your constructions and transduce them.
Length:
7653 bp
Designed by:
Enrique Paz
