Construction of the phage production control system.       In order to produce a grate amount of P4 phage particles that has our death system, we want to avoid the natural    early lysis that occur when WT P4 and P2 interact. This avoidance will be achieved by taking the control of the     two major regulators of P2 morphopoietic genes. The control systems that is going to be implemented is constituted     by a promoter inducible by IPTG in conjunction with transactivators cox and ogr from phage P2 . All this will     allow us to grow bacteria in grate quantities and induce lysis when ever we want and as a consequence the     production of grate amounts of P4 phage.
Qualitative characterization of the multipromoter .     The multipromoter that we have designed has the capacity to respond specifically to T3/T7 RNA polymerases    so if one or both polymarease are presente in the cell the genes downstream of this promoter will be active.     A first characterization approach is the introduction of a plasmid carring our promoter in the E. coli strain    BL21(DE3)pLysS that has a T7 RNA polymerase inducible by IPTG
July 30, 2009
Primers for P2 cox and ogr genes arrived so we can start to construct the phage production system control.
To attain control of phage production we are going to put under  an IPTG inducible promoter the genes that codify for the  principal regulators of the morphopoietic genes and delete genes that doesn't belongs to the morphopoietic group this part will be done by Laura Gomez .
The genes that codify for this regulators are going to be amplified via colony PCR from the E. coli C-177 strain, which  has a lysogenic form of phage P2 . The primers that we are using amplify the genes with its WT RBS's and also introduce an extra stop codon as required by the standardization  protocol and also de suffix and prefix iGEM sequences.
It is known that C-1a strain neither has a cox gene nor an ogr gene while C-1a K-12 strain contain a copy of ogr in its genome. We have performed a colony PCR over the  next strains, looking for ogr and cox .
Genes: ogr cox
Strains: C-1a C-117 DH5alpha
July 31, 2009
Colony PCR is going to be done with strain C-1a and C-117 as a control DH5alpha which has 17, we are going  to confirm that C-1a doesn't has a P2 by means of PCR for P2 cox and ogr genes.

Strains were platted on June 19, 2009 and were maintained at 4ºC and also a glycerol stock was created for C-1a and C-117 . With a wood stick bacteria was taken and inoculated in LB without any selection.
The inoculated medium was incubated at 37ºC 250 rpm. for 1 hr. and then centrifuged at maximum speed with  a tabletop centrifuge, supernatant was discarded and 200 µL of Tris-EDTA 10/1-NaCl 10mM added. The samples were heated over 10 min at 95ºC and then centrifuged again 2 min. 10µL of supernatant were taken for the PCR.
PCR Reaction:     Water         24µL    Buffer 10x    5µL    MgCl2 50mM    2.5µL    dNTP's 0.4mM  3.5µL    Taq           1µL    primer up     2.5µL    primer low    2.5µL    DNA           10µL    Total         50µL
PCR results:    Control  - C-117 / ogr + C-1a / ogr - DH5alpha / ogr + C-117 / cox + C-1a / cox - DH5alpha / cox -
The PCR's were consistent with previous results in literature. For example ogr was positive for DH5alpha which is a derivative from K-12 and we could  not obtain PCR products from C-1a . C-117 which has P2 in lysogenic state gave use positive PCR products for ogr and cox .
August 3, 2009
We prepared overnights of DH5alpha which contain the BioBricks pSB1AK3 and pSB1T3 the selective medium was 50µL/mL Kanamycin and 20µL/mL Tetracycline respectively
August 4, 2009
We redo the colony PCR for ogr and cox only using the C-117 strain. The PCR products were purified using the High Pure PCR Product Roche's Purification Kit and also plasmidic DNA was  purified from the last overnights using the High Pure Plasmid Roche's Isolation Kit. The plasmids that were purified  are going to used to add a double terminator sequence to ogr and clone cox for future manipulations.
1) ogr EcoRI/SpeI        2) cox EcoRI/PstI        3) BBa_B0015 EcoRI/XbaI (plasmid pSB1AK3 )        4) BBa_J04450 EcoRI/PstI (plasmid pSB1T3 )
Restriction Reactions:   DNA 10µL  Ezimas .5µL each one    Buffer 2µL  Water 7µL  Total 20µL
Vectors that will be use for cloning were dephosphorylated with Antarctic Phosphatase to avoid as much as possible false positives and also screening to many colonies.
Dephosphorylation Reaction:   Plasmid  20µL  Buffer  3µL  Enzyme  1µL  Water  6µL  Total  30µL       Incubation conditions:   1) 15 min --> 37ºC  2) 5 min  --> 65ºC
Parts were ligated in the following way:
1) ogr + BBa_B0015 + pSB1T3 2) cox + pSB1T3
Ligation Reactions:   1)   Buffer 4µL  Ligase 1µL pSB1T3 2µL ogr 6µL BBa_B0015 7µL  Weter 0µL  Total 20µL   2)   Buffer 4µL  Ligase 1µL pSB1T3 3µL cox 6µL  Weter 6µL  Total 20µL
The las reaction gave as a result the next parts:
1) ogr + BBa_B0015 + pSB1T3 2) cox + pSB1T3
DH5alpha competent cells were transformed and platted on LB Agar with appropriate selection, for both constructions this selection was Tetracycline.
August 6, 2009
The ogr PCR product was cut with EbaI/PstI and cloned in pSB1T3 that was digested with the same enzymes and dephosphorylated as mentioned earlier. And then we performed a ligation reaction. The resulting BioBrick was named I-09#021.
1) ogr EcoRI/PstI
Restriction Reaction:   DNA 10µL  Ezimas .5µL   Buffer 2µL  Water 7µL  Total 20µL
A 1% agarose gel was prepared and run 1 hr. 85 V. to see the  insert and plasmid concentration. Unfortunately we loose our ogr's PCR product so we performed a new PCR only for this gene.
August 7, 2009
The PCR for ogr was done using the DNA from strain C-117 .
PCR Reaction:   Water  23µL  Buffer 5µL  MgCl2 2.5µL  dNTPs  .5 each  Taq/pol 1µL  Oligo 2.5 each  DNA 10µL  Total 50µL
PCR:    1) Control +  2) C-117/ ogr +  3) C-117/ ogr +  4) C-117/ ogr +  5) C-117/ ogr +
An Agarose gel was run and we find that one of our reactants was contaminated because our negative control was positive that PCR is going to be repeated but with different reactants
August 10, 2009
We are going to change the PCR reagents because we don't know if they are contaminated and perform the next PCR reaction.
Reagents to be changed:   1)primers for cox and ogr 2)buffer 10X  3)MgCl2
I'm going to do again the PCR for ogr and cox only from C-117 and as a control C-1a and DH5alpha the former control neither has a cox gene nor an ogr gene.
PCR Reactions:          1)     2)     3)     4)      5)      6)     7)      8)      9)     10)   Water            23µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  Buffer 10X        5µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  MgCl2           2.5µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  dNTP's          3.5µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  Taq               1µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  primer fw       2.5µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  primer rev      2.5µL   +      +      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  DNA tamplate     10µL   -      -      +      +       +       +      +       +       +       +  1)control for cox only primers 2)control for ogr only primers 3)control for DH5alpha ogr it must be positive 4)control for ogr & cox with strain C-1a it must be negative 5-7)PCR of interest positive for C-117 ogr gene 8-10)PCR of interest positive for C-117 cox gene
August 11, 2009
The PCR for ogr was done again and everything looked OK so we purified the PCR  products with the High Pure PCR Product Roche's Purification Kit. An Agarose gel was run to see how much DNA was lost during the purification procedure and  the using this information to add the right amount of restriction enzymes.
The first three lanes are cox , ogr and ogr + BBa_B0015 amplified using the prefix and suffix primer for these genes
Agust 13, 2009
Plasmid 18 was dephosphorylated because we are going to insert in it the ogr product that was amplified yesterday.
Dephosphorylation Reaction:    Plasmid    20µL   Buffer     3µL   Enzyme     1µL   Water      6µL          Incubation:      1)15 min --> 37ºC     2)5 min  --> 65ºC
This plasmid that is going to be ligated with ogr is digested EcoRI/PstI.
cox was cut with EcoRI/SpeI and the plasmid that contain ogr + BBa_B0015 with EcoRI/XbaI because we are going to insert cox into this plasmid in order to concatenate cox + ogr +BBa_B0015.
August 14, 2009
Vector pSB1T3 was dephosphorylated and again a 1% Agarose gel was run with the vector and  the ogr PCR product to check concentrations and posterior to this a ligation reaction was performed.
The Ligase enzyme that we are using is T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs which has the following reaction conditions
10 min at 23ºC and for inactivation incubate 20 min at 70ºC
Ligation Reaction:   T4 Ligase 1µL  Buffer  2µL ogr 2µL pSB1T3 5µL  Water  10µL  Total  20µL
Once the ligation reaction finished we transformed DH5alpha competent cells and platted them on selective medium.
August 18, 2009
We started to prepare glycerol for the BrioBricks and Strains that we have finished to store them at -70ºC.
The BBa_R0010 / pSB1A2 which has an IPTG inducible promoter is going to be purified and digested to put under the control of this promoter the construction cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 .
The plasmid was digested with SpeI/PstI and the insert with XbaI/PstI.
To construct cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 we took cox that was in pSB1T3 and ogr + BBa_B0015 also in pSB1T3 and perform the following reactions:
Restriction Reaction:             Resistance pSB1T3 + ogr + BBa_B0015 XbaI/PstI   Tet pSB1T3 + cox EcoRI/SpeI   Tet pSB1C3 EcoRI/PstI   Cm
We expect white colonies and resistant to Cm because pSB1C3 has cloned an RFP protein that  is expressed constitutively.
August 20, 2009
We performed restriction reactions with different colonies that carry the same plasmid to perform parallel constructions to avoid the case where a mutation could arise over one of the constructions leading this to the need of doing again the whole construction from a previous step.
DH5alpha strains that contain the listed plasmids below were grown in selective media and plasmid  purification was performed and afterwards it was digested.
Plasmids:    1) ogr XbaI/PstI  2) ogr+pSB1CB XbaI/PstI  3) ogr+pSB1CB EcoRI/PstI  4) ogr+pSB1CB EcoRI/PstI  5) ogr+pSB1CB EcoRI/PstI  6) BBa_J04450 EcoRI/PstI  7) ogr+BBa_PB1005 EcoRI/PstI  8) BBa_J04450 EcoRI/PstI        9) cox
Restriction Reactions:    Buffer  4µL   BSA  .4µL  DNA  25µL   Enzyme  2µL each  Water  6.6µL  Total  40µL
August 21, 2009
An 1% Agarose gel was run for 1hr. at 85 V.
With this gel was confirmed that ogr is cloned in pSB1T3 and now we can make a glycerol for this strain.
First nine lanes interest.
24 Ago 2009
The pSB1C3 was dephosphorylated with antarctic phosphate
Dephospohrialtion Reaction:   Plasmid  20µL  Buffer  3µL  Enzyme  1µL  Water  6µL  Total  30µL   Incubation:     1) 15 min ––> 37ºC   2) 5 min --> 65ºC
After plasmid dephosphorialtion we are going to perform a ligation reaction between cox and ogr+BBa_0015
August 25, 2009
Again an Agarose was run 1hr. at 85 V. to se the relative concentration of each sample that is going to be use  for the ligation reaction.
Ligation Reaction:   T4-ligase  1µL  Buffer  2µL  #023.1  3µL  #022.1  3µL  #017.1  2µL  Water  9µL  Total  20µL   Incubation:    1) 10 min. --> 20ºC-25ºC   2) 20 min. --> 65ºC   Controls:    1) Vector without dephosphorylation    2) Dephosphorilated vector without insert
We platted DH5alpha transformed cells over selective medium and incubate the plates overnight at 37ºC.
August 27, 2009
Plasmid extraction
August 29, 2009
From ligation and transformation on Ago 25 a restriction analysis form tree selected proteins.
We are going to cut the purified plasmid from transformed cells in the following way:
1) I-09#012 SpeI/PstI  2) I-09#24.1 XbaI/PstI  3) I-09#24.2 XbaI/PstI  4) I-09#24.3 XbaI/PstI
Restriction Reaction:   Buffer   4µL  BSA  0.4µL  Enzyme  2µL each   DNA  25µL  Total  40µL
We run a 1% Agarose gel at 85 V. 1hr
Unfortunately cox + ogr +BBa_B0015 cloning by fusing cox and ogr +BBa_B0015 in another plasmid  didn't work out. We will try to repeat the procedure to see if we are luckier.
September 7, 2009
Again we dephophorylated vector I-09#017 to ligate it with cox and ogr +BBa_B0015 and then perform a transformation
Dephosphorylation Reaction:   Plasmid  20µL  Buffer  3µL  Enzyme  1µL  Water  6µL  Total  30µL       Incubation conditions:   1) 15 min --> 37ºC  2) 5 min  --> 65ºC
Ligation Reaction:         T4-ligase  1µL        Buffer  2µL        #023.1  3µL        #022.1  3µL        #017.1  2µL        Water  9µL        Total  20µL      Incubation conditions:         1) 10 min. --> 20ºC-25ºC        2) 20 min. --> 65ºC      Controls:         1) Vector without dephosphorylation         2) Dephosphorilated vector
We platted DH5alpha transformed cells over selective medium and incubated overnight at 37ºC.
September 11, 2009
Colony PCR reactions were done with selected colonies that resulted from the last transformation the resulting and tow of the twenty-one looked like they contained cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 verification  with a restriction assay was done and also ogr +BBa_B0015+18 was purified and opened digested with EcoRI/PstI to be prepared  in case last ligation don't work.
September 15, 2009
The ligation didn't work, I planned to follow a different strategy first purify the cox fragment using Low melt point Agarose, we are using this procedure because the plasmido that contain cox is the samen as the one that has ogr +BBa_B0015 and as a consequence the same antibiotic resistance gene, so by separating the DNA by electrophoresis we can take apart cox gene and the ligated in to the dephoshorylated plasmid ogr +BBa_B0015 that was digested EcoRI/XbaI, the resultin plasmid will be cox + ogr +BBa_B0015.
September 22, 2009
Band purification:
Quiagen gel exration kit was used for this.
An 1% Low melt point agarose gel was loaded with the sample that contained cox +18, the gel was stained with ethdium bromaid and saw with a transluminator. Once we saw our band it was cut from the gel and transferred to an 1.5 mL tube and weighted (0.13g) in the kit protocol they propose an equivalences of buffer  100mg~100µL so we have to add 3 volumes of each 130µL of buffer and follow the kit protocol.
September 23, 2009
A ligation is going to be done with cox and ogr +BBa_B0015, ogr +BBa_B0015+18 was dephosphorylated and cox was purified via gel. As a control we will try to religate the dephosphorylated plasmid, the same plasmid not dephosphorylated and a uncut plasmid  which must transform because was not digested.
Ligation Reaction:   T4 ligase   1µL  Buffer      2µL ogr +BBa_B0015     2µL cox 5µL  Water       10µL  Total       20µL     Controls:      1)dephosphorylated plasmid         2)non-dephosphorylated          T4 ligase   1µL                    T4 ligase     1µL     Buffer      2µL                    Buffer        2µL     Plasmid     2µL                    Plasmid       2µL     Water      15µL                    Water        15µL     Total      20µL                    Total        20µL
Incubation:      1)10 min --> 25ºC     2)20 min --> 65ºC
DH5alpha competent cells were transformed and platted over selective media in this case Tet.
September 24, 2009
All controls resulted as expected so the must probable is that we achieved to ligate cox with ogr +BBa_B0015+18  I prepared overnights to extract plasmid tomorrow and perform a restriction assay to see if we have the fragment of interest.
September 25, 2009
To check last ligations a restriction assay is going to be done in a way that allows us to do the next ligation and finish the phage production control system.
Restriction Reactions:    1)XbaI/PstI cox +18              2)XbaI/PstI cox + ogr +BBa_B0015 colonies[1-6]   Buffer 2       2µL              Buffer2           2µL   BSA          0.2µL              BSA             0.2µL   Water        6.8µL              Water           6.8µL   DNA           10µL              DNA              10µL   Enzyme       0.5µL each(X/P)    Enzyme          0.5µL each(X/P)   Total         20µl              Total            20µL
As the image show on the first 7 lanes we were able to ligate cox with ogr +BBa_B0015+18 every of the  selected clones has the cox insert so this procedure was faster than the fisr that we tried to use the only thing is that you need to purify the insert via an Agarose gel and the ligate it to the plasmid of interest.
We are ready for the last step, we are going to add the IPTG inducible promoter to get the following structure.
iptg+cox+ogr+ter
The second lane sample was selected for ligation with IPTG
Ligation Reaction:    T4 ligase        1µL   Buffer           2µL cox + ogr +BBa_B0015      5µL   iptg             5µL   Water           10µL   Total           20µL
DH5alpha competent cells were transformed and platted over LB Amp100 and incubate at 37ºC
September 28, 2009
Controls were inconsistent in particular the re-ligation of dephosphorylated plasmid which gave  the same amount of colonies compared with ligation of cox + ogr +BBa_B0015 and 12 so we are going to  re-dephosphorylate the vector 12 and perform a new ligation reaction.
Dephosphorylation Reaction:    Plasmid     10µL   Buffer       3µL   Enzyme       1µL   Water       16µL   Total       30µL      Incubation      1)10 min --> 25ºC     2)20 min --> 65ºC
A 1% agarose gel was run to see the concetration of the plasmid and the insert, this to put  the right amounts of insert and plasmid.
The samples that we are looking on the gel correspon to cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 +18 digested with XbaI/SpeI and 12
Once we checked concetrations we can do the ligation reaction.
Ligation Reaction:      T4 ligase     1µL    Buffer        2µL cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 12µL    12            4µL    Water         1µL    Total        30µL
DH5alpha competent cells were transformed on LB agar Amp100 and incubated overnight 37ºC
September 29, 2009
Four colonies were selected an re-platted and also liquid 5 mL of LB was inoculated to prepare cultures for plasmid extraction.
September 30, 2009
An 1% Agarose gel was run to check concentrations for restriction assays and by this be able to know if we have  the fragment we are interested.
The four plasmids were digested EcoRI/PstI
Restriction Reactions:   Buffer     2µL  BSA 0.2µL  DNA       10µL  Enzyme     1µL each  EcoRI/PstI  Water    5.8µL
The insert looks shifted upwards but a little amount so we didn't achieve to ligate the iptg to cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 this is strange because the plasmid maintained its size so the promoter is not there.I've checked the plasmid size an it is 2079 bp so the plasmid doesn't has the promoter.
Going back further when I digested for the first time plasmid pSB1A2 I did it with SpeI/PstI to allow  promoter to be at the beginning of the construction.The insert cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 was digested XbaI/PstI so I think the unique alternative is that promoter ipteg wasn't  in the plasmid.
In this circumstance we can only say that we changed cox + ogr + BBa_B0015 from plasmid pSB1T3 to pSB1A212 that is resitantant to  Amp.
October 5, 2009
To test for the activity of the multipromoter that we designed and synthesized, we are going to  transform E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS from novagen. This strain uses a T7 phage polymerase that is controlled thorough Lac promoter. The multipromoter is composed of T7 & T3 promoters, we expect that our construction will respond to IPTG.
The IPTG preparation protocol we used is discribed HERE!!!
Transformed cells were platted on LB medium with Kn and IPTG .5 mM and expect that the colonies will fluoresce  and could be seeing with a transluminator.
Octuber 6, 2009
We took a look to the LB Agar plates with a transluminator at a wavelength of 395nm but because we didn't have a  filter for GFP emitting wavelength we couldn't discriminate for our wavelength of interest.
We are going to try other approach this time with a microscope more suitable to see GFP.

Cultures were prepared as follows:
BL21/m+         BL21/m+       BL21/m-    100 mL LB                    +               +             +    100 µL Kan 30 µg/µL          +               +             -     100 µL Cam 20 µg/µL          +               +             +     10 µL IPTG 1M               +               -             +
For the induction of protein production we started our culture at .1 abs 620nm in 100mL LB and waited until it reached 0.35 abs 620 nm then we added IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1mM and then we leave the culture media for four  hours.
5mL of each culture were centrifuged at max speed and the supernatant was discarded. We prepared our samples to see them. Using a microscope with suitable filters and light to see GFP we compared the cultures between them
Results:                 Bl21/m+     Bl21/m+    Bl21/m-       IPTG        +            -         +                  ++++         ++         -          Fluorescence
In frame is BL21/multipromoter with IPTG inducer at 100X. Unfortunately the microscope and camera were not suitable to check in full detail BL21/m- IPTG+, which gave no fluorescence, and Bl21/multipromoter IPTG-, which presented a diminished fluorescence.
This results support the functioning of multipromoter for T7 polymerase.
Great NEWS!!! our promoter worked for T7 RNA polymerase
For future experiments to get a better characterization look result site.

I prepared cultures to purify plasmid that contains the parts that we are planning to send to the registry.
Part List: cox ogr ogr + cox + BBa_B0015 multipromoter
Three overnights for multipromoter testing were prepared, one would be induced by IPTG, other not and the latter is a BL21 strain that doesn't have the construction but will be grown with IPTG.
