Biobricks used from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts
BBa_R1062
Promoter, Standard (luxR and HSL regulated -- lux pR)
Designed by Vinay S Mahajan, Voichita D. Marinescu, Brian Chow, Alexander D Wissner-Gross and Peter Carr Drew Endy
Group: Registry
[Note: This is the same part as R0062 except that the -10 and -35 sites and spacing have been changed to comply with BBa_S0001]. Promoter activated by LuxR in concert with HSL The lux cassette of V. fischeri contains a left and a right promoter. The right promoter gives weak constitutive expression of downstream genes.This expression is up-regulated by the action of the LuxR activator protein complexed with the autoinducer, 3-oxo-hexanoyl-HSL. Two molecules of LuxR protein form a complex with two molecules of the signalling compound homoserine lactone (HSL). This complex binds to a palindromic site on the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription.
BBa_C0261
AHL-making Enzyme, luxI (+RBS)
BBa_B0015
Double terminator
Designed by Reshma Shetty   Group: Registry   (2003-07-17)
BBa_P1003
Kanamycin resistance cassette
Designed by Reshma Shetty   Group: Knight Lab, MIT   (2006-01-23)
Kanamycin resistance cassette including promoter and coding sequence. It lacks a terminator.
Usage and Biology
Used for modular BioBrick vector construction using BioBrick base vector BBa_I51020.

BBa_J04450
RFP Coding Device
Designed by Tamar Odle   Group: iGEM_Davidson   (2005-06-09)
The colonies are clearly red in color under natural light after about 18 hours. Smaller colonies are visibly red under UV. The RFP part does not contain a degradation tag and the RBS is strong.
LacI sensitive
CAP sensitive
This part is commonly used, but can fail if the system contains LacI or CAP protein.
BBa_R0010
Promoter (lacI regulated)
This part is an inverting regulator sensitive to LacI and CAP.
It contains two protein binding sites. The first binds the CAP protein, which is generally present in E.coli and is asocciated with cell health and availability of glucose. The second binds LacI protein.
In the absence of LacI protein and CAP protein, this part promotes transcription.
In the presence of LacI protein and CAP protein, this part inhibits transcription.
LacI can be inhibited by IPTG.
LacI is coded by BBa_C0010
Usage and Biology
This is a direct copy of bases 0365739 through 0365540 of the E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome, Genbank NC_000913 in reverse complement form. It is the natural promoter for the LacZYA operon. It includes the tail end of the LacI gene coding region, but no promoter region for that partial gene.
BBa_K116640
pTet + RBS + LuxR + T
Designed by Jesse Wu   Group: iGEM08_NYMU-Taipei   (2008-10-30)
LuxR regulated by the pTet promoter. Used to constitutively express LuxR.
K094130
Rbs-mRFP1-terminator
Designed by Shi Lei   Group: iGEM08_iHKU   (2008-10-13)
This part is adapted from part BBa_J04450, with the pLacI promoter deleted. This part can serve as promoter efficiency test kit.
pSB1C3
Plasmid used as a control with Cloranphenicol resistance.
pSB1T3
Plasmid used as a backbone.
