Wet lab's work
Objectives:
The final aim is to get and test the following device.
After the arival of Mr. Gene's shipment, we have some more partial goals, the work to achieve them will be performed by Abraham
Ensamble and prove the functionality of the kamikaze device.
Get the time in wich a colicin, preferentially E3, kills E. coli c1-alpha.
Clone the bioparts received from Gene Art into any iGEM plasmid vector. Send them to the Registry of standard biological parts.
Partial goals:
Get the time in wich a colicin, preferentially E3, kills Escherichia coli c1-alpha
Clone both colicines into any iGEM vector.
Clone both colicines at the suffix of the biobrick BBa_R0010 in order to get an IPTG inducible device.
Measure the time of death after the induction with IPTG.
Clone the MultiPromoter_GFP with all the death device
Insert the MP_GFP biobrick into any iGEM vector.
Insert the 2 colicines after the MP_GFP.
Join this product with all the other biobricks.
