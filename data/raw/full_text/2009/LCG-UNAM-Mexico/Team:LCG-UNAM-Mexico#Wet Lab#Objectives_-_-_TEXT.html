Construction of the phage production control system.
In order to produce a grate amount of P4 phage particles that have our death system, we want to avoid the natural   early lysis that occur when WT P4 and P2 interact. This avoidance will be achieved by taking the control of the    two major regulators of P2 morphopoietic genes and deleting them form lysogenic P2; this will yield a P2 phage    which only has capsid and tail genes.  The control system that is going to be implemented is constituted by a    promoter inducible by IPTG in conjunction with transactivators cox and ogr from phage P2. All this will    allow us to grow bacteria in great quantities, induce lysis whenever we want and consequently a stock amount   of modified P2.
Qualitative characterization of T7/T3 multipromoter.
The multi-promoter that we have designed has the capacity to respond specifically to T7/T3 RNA polymerases   so if one or both polymerases are present in the cell the genes downstream of this promoter will be active.    A first characterization approach is the introduction of a plasmid carrying our promoter in the E. coli strain   BL21(DE3)pLysS that has a T7 RNA polymerase inducible by IPTG and then perform assays with and without this    inductor, finally microscope visualization with suitable filter and light will be performed to see a GFP that    is under control of the multipromoter.

To obtain all the relevant experimental information about T7 and T3.
Model validation needs some critical parameters like strain(C1a) growth rate and the T3 and T7 burst sizes. The   parameters found in the literature correspond to k12 strain however we used a k12 derivative strain, C1a, for this   reason it was indispensable to obtain experimentally a C1a growth plot. In the same way, simulations  showed us that the burst size is a critical parameter to determine the efficiency of our system.
Generation of data to feedback the infection model.
Our Model Simulates both Molecular and Population Dynamics for the Defense System. Important  parameters must be estimated  experimentally. The most important parameter in the defense system is the Burst Size . Experimental measures  of the Burst Size are of vital importance. The Molecular Model will simulate the intracellular  dynamics and will generate a Burst Size Distribution. With my experimental results we will validate and improve the model.   At the population scale the Cellular Automaton will simulate the interaction between populations of     bacteria and phages, T7 infection experiments will provide valuable information to the Population model.

Ensamble the kamikaze construction
Clone the colicines with the multipromoter, design and Clone the asRNA and help in the ensamble of all the device.
Test the construction
Obtain the time that E3 takes to kill E. coli, this parameter will be provided to the model. The preference
for E3 above E9 is due to a modeling suggestion that shows the effectivity of our system when the translation
machinery is disrupted, test the efficience of plaquing with the asRNA by itself and the efficience of all the
device.

Assembly of the P4 vector
We want P4 to work as a transduction vector for biobricks . Several things need to be done, which include
individual  amplification of P4 sid1 essential region, which we expect to be sufficient for a stable permanence
of the biobrick inside the cell. To test this, the first biobrick added will be a reporter gene, which is intended
to permanently stay with our P4 version. This is enough to further produce our P4 viral particles and assess
functionality of the delivery by transduction into several wild-type bacterial strains as reported in literature.
Checking functionality for the Kamikaze system
Now we will be ready to ligate the entire device. Many things have to be assessed, as the complete packaging and
delivery of the vector into the host cells, and of course, the functionality of the system. This involves
checking for presence and reaction to AHL, production of antisense RNAs and many parameter calculations.
P2 control system functionality
The cox/ogr control system in which Uriel is working needs experimental validation of functionality.
I intend to transform P2 lysogenic strains and expect lysis through activation of such genes.
This will prove the construction works.
P4 as an iGEM Plasmid
P4 will have to suffer many more modifications in order that it functions as an iGEM standard vector. The design
automatically eliminated forbidden restriction sites, but we also need transcription terminators and universal
primers. After addition of such sequences, functionality has to be assessed again.

Design of our modified version of bacteriophage P4
We pretend to modify P4 to use it as an standard vehicle for synthetic constructions. My mission: Define what we need to do over P4 genome and how to do it in order to construct a bacteriophage compatible with standards in  synthetic biology.
Construction and test of the gossip device (quorum sensing)
Some -a lot- of restrictions, ligations, transformations, tests, etc. to assemble this device. The idea of this device is that infected bacteria will send and alarm to the surrounding bacteria. The alarm consist in a molecule  of quorum sensing. Until the alarm will not save any bacteria, this molecule will activate transcription of an antisense to delay the cycle of the virus.
Test the host range of our modified P4
According to litterature bacteriophage P4 has an unusual host-range. We would like to test it so we can transport easily synthetic construction to another interesting bacteria species! Some of this bacteria reported as hosts for P4 are: E.Coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Rhizobium.
Test the biobrick of P4 cos-site
P4 cos-site is a DNA fragmen of P4 genome that serves as a signal for packaging its DNA into the capsid. The idea is that with our sistem for P4 production and this biobrick you can encapsidate any!! DNA sequence and transduce it.
