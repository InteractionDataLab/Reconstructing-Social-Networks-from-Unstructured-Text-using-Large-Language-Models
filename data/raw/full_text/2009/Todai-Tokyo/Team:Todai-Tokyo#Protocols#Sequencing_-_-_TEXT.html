Sequencing Protocol
We use the Big Dye Sequencing system with using the following conditions.
Prepare the following solution:
1.8ul 5 ｘ B.D.3.1 buffer
0.4ul B.D.3.1.
6.3ul MilliQ
1ul 0.15ug/ul DNA
0.5ul 3.2pmol/ul primer
Amplify using the following PCR program
96ºC 2min
96ºC 10sec
55ºC 5sec
60ºC 3min
Repeat 2-4 29times
25ºC pause
Add 0.5ul Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase
Incubate at 37ºC for 1h
Add 1ul of 3M KOAc or NaOAc
Mix and transfer to 1.5ml eppendorf
Add 25ul of 100% EtOH and mix well
Spin for 10min at 20,000g, 4ºC
Discard supernatant and dry pellet
Add 15ul of HiDi Buffer
Transfer to PCR tubes to sequence (use the sequencer in the lab)
