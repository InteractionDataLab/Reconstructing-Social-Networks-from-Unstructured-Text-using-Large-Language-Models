Plan
Aim: Create yeast cells that express LDLR on their cell membrane
Methods:
Clone the LDLR gene.
Create biobrick of LDLR.
July
We got LDLR cDNA and tried cloning.
Both ends of LDLR contains a lot of GC,so we had hard time...
7/6
Overview:
1. PCR LDLR gene from plasmid containing LDLR cDNA
2.gel-purify DNA from the PCR product
3.insert the DNA to vector (iGEM parts)
4. Transform into E. coli and select for ampicillin resistance
5.check for Transformation success using colony PCR by LDLR primers
Constructs to be created:
pGal1-Kozak-LDLR-terminator
Obtaining DNA:
Resuspended DNA in the following wells with 10ul water:
plate 1 7D
pGal1(including Kozak sequence)
Gal1 promoter
Transformed 1ul of each of the above into DH5a competent cells:
Transformation
Mix 1ul of DNA with 100ul of competent cells on ice.
Leave on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at 42ºC for 45 seconds.
Leave on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 500ul of LB and incubate at 37ºC for 1 hour.
Plate on LB-ampicillin plates.
