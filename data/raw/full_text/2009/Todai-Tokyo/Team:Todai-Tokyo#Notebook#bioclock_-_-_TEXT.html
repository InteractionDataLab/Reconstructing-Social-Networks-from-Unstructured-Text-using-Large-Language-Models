Our Records
Although we are very interested in "bioclock", what to do in this iGEM project was really difficult to decide. After discussing and searching paper for few months, we finally decided to make "UV induced oscillator", as described on the Project page. The oscillator was based on the previous work, the switching device was added to control the oscillator as we want. As we were not quite sure whether this circuit really work, so we decided to analyze it in silico, by modeling.
Detailed experimental plan was settled near the end of July. Since the promoter of the oscillatory device was synthesized products and unavailable from any oforganism, we had it synthesized. It took almost a month until we receive the DNA!!
When making the oscillator, we needed the plasmid vector of p15A origin which has low copy numbers and ColE1 origin of high copy numbers in E.coli cells, as strict control of the total protein amount was required. Among iGEM parts, pSB3K3 plasmid vector had the p15A origin and BBa_J63010 had ColE1 origin.
ColE1 origin plasmid were successfully cloned from 2009 Spring Kit Plate1, 7D. Meanwhile, the cloning of p15A ori plasmid was somehow of extreme difficulty. The first parts we choose to clone was 2009 Spring Kit Plate1, 7M and start to clone it from August 6, but never had it been available. After numerous unfruitful trials, we gave up and decided to get it from 2009 Spring Kit Plate3, 21D on September 24, but this parts neither couldn't be cloned. Finally, Chiba team gave us the BBa_I7100 parts, and now we were able to use it. Come to think of it, it took so long to change our plan of what part to be cloned. It was perhaps due to the difficulty of sharing information. Since we are on four project at the same time, it was very hard for each member to fully catch up with all the experiments ongoing.
Other genes are also cloned after numerous failures. Although wiki freezes on 21 October, we are still trying to complete our experiments. You will see whether we can succeed or not at the Jamboree!!
