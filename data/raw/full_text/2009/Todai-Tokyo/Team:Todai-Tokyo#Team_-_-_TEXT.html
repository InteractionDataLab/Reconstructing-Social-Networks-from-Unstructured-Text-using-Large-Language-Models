CONTRIBUTIONS
We started our project last October. It started from learning what is synthetic biology visiting laboratories of our interests during the first few months. Each member had his/her own interests, and we decided to work on four projects (It turned out to be very tough, as we had too much to do and it was almost impossible for each member to fully catch up with the all projects).
The rough plan was settled on July and we started our experiments. The laboratory was a little far from our home, we had a trip of one hour and a half before getting there.
The school was over at the beginning of August, the longed summer vacation started. At first, it was numerous mistakes and failures. Since most of the team members were beginners, we didn't know how to do PCR! Also, it was very difficult to communicate since we worked in shifts. Although we shared notebook, at first we didn't know what information is important. The most difficult thing for us was sequencing and we made mistake again and again, the experiment didn't proceed due to the lack of the sequencing data. Through series of trial and error, we learned what to write on the notebook, how to do our experiment most effectively, how to use the laboratory machines. We gradually learned to succeed in each experiments.
But alas! The summer vacation was now over, and school started once again in October. Our projects had still long way to go. Members went to the lab after the classes over, and worked through night.
DAITI TAMARU was our excellent adviser of all the projects. Our plan would not ever have been settled without his advices.
CRAIG HAMILTON advised us how to present our projects on wiki. He helped us to submit the forms in English.
YUTARO KII found sponsors of our projects.
LDLR
Our best of the best of the best leader CHIE UMATANI was rich in experience in biological experiment, and make protocols of iGEM experiments, told us experimental tips in order not to make mistakes and to successfully complete the experiments. She also understood well about each projects and made overall plan.
HIROKI KAWAI stayed in the lab for many days, and did the experiments though night. As we were running short of time, it was of great help.
YUSHI SUZUKI wrote our project abstract without sleeping for two days.
HIROYUKI YAMAZAKI's careful experiments was our breakthrough to PCR LDLR gene.
TAKAKI YAMAMOTO's success in the DNA sequencing of many parts promoted us to go on to the next experimental steps.
TABACCO
KOJI TANAKA, the director of tobacco projects, also worked on ethical problems.
BREAD
AKIKO NISHIMURA and TAKUYA KOMURA planed the bread projects .
BIOCLOCK
MASASHI SALVADOR made our wiki format.
XIN YIN wrote a complicated program for Bioclock project modeling.
XIASONG SUN came to the lab when others couldn't during the examination.
MARINA KOMATSU made a presentation at a meeting of synthetic biology.
AND ALL THE MEMBERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXPERIMENTS AND MAKING WIKI. OUR PROJECT WOULD NEVER BE LIKE IT IS WITHOUT ANY OF YOU. WE HAD A GREAT IGEM YEAR TOGETHER! THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!

And YOKO TOMIZAWA planned the Bioclock project, who we all appreciate very much.
