Intermediates and proposed constructs for the the 2 plasmid locking system
Original design
In this design, each of the construct has its own antibiotic resistance marker (independent of the plasmid backbone marker).
Plasmid 1
Plasmid 2
Final design
We decided to remove the extra antibiotic markers from the inserts. Then it looks like this
Plasmid 1
We had more than one way to build plasmid 1
Path 1
Path 1
Plasmid 2
Intermediates and proposed constructs for the the 3 plasmid locking system
We have designed the constructs for the 3 plasmid system, but we haven't planned to build it yet. Some of the parts built for the 2 plasmid system could be reused for the 3 plasmid system too.
Intermediates planned through PCR protocol
These parts are essentially same as the those that occur in the construction strategies that are shown above.
