Biosafety
Biosafety issues with project, reagents or parts:
UBC iGEM's 2009 project did not raise any biosafety issues as it did not involve work with any pathogenic parts or organisms. The vector recipients used are all non-pathogenic E.coli (DH5a, DB3, BW). We conducted the majority of our work with promoters and reporters. The parts we made are modifications of previously confirmed non-pathogenic molecules (Cre recombinase with LVA tag, anti-sense jammer, modified promoter). These parts alone should not pose any harm regardless of the host organism it has. Most reagents we worked with have little to no toxic effect. Any reagents with potential safety concerns like the DNA stains and flammable reagents were used with appropriate care as mandated and taught by our local biosafety group.
The laboratory space we used are certified for Biosafety Level 2 and all works were performed well within the constraints of the certification.
Safety protocol and precautions followed:
All members of our team have taken the required Laboratory health safety course from our local biosafety group. We ensured that our members were consistent with wearing protective gears (lab coat, nitrile or latex gloves,etc). We were aware of any allergies to reagents used and appropriate precautions were taken to minimize any risk.
Local biosafety group and their view of our project:
The local biosafety group for our project is the Department of Health Safety and Environment( HSE ) of UBC. Our laboratory space and equipment meets all safety requirements as per Canadian regulations and the regulations of the HSE. Furthermore, the laboratory space and necessary equipment have passed recent inspection.
