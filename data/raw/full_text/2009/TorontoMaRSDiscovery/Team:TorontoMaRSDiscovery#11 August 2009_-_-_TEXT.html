Digested 4, 5, Enc, C(E+P), C(X+S)
BB4 did not digest
5, C is stored in fridge
Calvin suggested increasing the concentration of enzyme and increase time of digestion due to thawing enzymes over weekend in fridge
Miniprepped 1+2(1) with new kit, got great yield ~100ng/ul
Gel extracted C (X+S) after it was CIPed
Overnight ligation of Enc+C in PCR machine
Calvin gave us 2 vials of RbCl cells in -80C
one time use only
thaw and add DNA
