Received from Rosa (SPiT):
TM0785
Plasmid containing encapsulin
Recommend transfect into bacteria and re-sequence
See email note regarding sequence error
0.5 microliters TMG DNA 100 microgram/microliter
Use 0.4 microliter for 50 microliter PCR reaction =August 1, 2009=
Overnight encapsulin cultures 1 and 6 (randomly selected) and the negative control were miniprepped
The rest of the encapsulin cultures were stocked with 20% glycerol
6 digestions were done: Enc1, Enc6, Enc -ve, BB5, BB7, and C
16ul of BB5 plasmid was used
500ng of plasmid were used for the others
The digestions were run on a 1.3% agarose gel in TAE (from here on, unless otherwise specified, all gels were 1.3% agarose)
BB5 was confirmed and all other parts were correct as well
Overnight ligation of 7+Enc in the PCR machine
