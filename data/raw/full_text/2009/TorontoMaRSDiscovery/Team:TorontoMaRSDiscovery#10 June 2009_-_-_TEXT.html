Poured 10 Tet plates following procedure on June 5, 2009
Due to problems with DNA ladder and restriction enzyme digest yesterday, procedures were followed again today with the following adjustments
DNA was diluted and run on lanes 1-5 of gel:
Lane 1 - 1X
Lane 2 - 1/6X
Lane 3 - 1/36X
Lane 4 - 1/10X
Lane 5 - 1/100X
Restriction enzyme digest was repeated with an incubation time of 4 h at 37 degrees Celsius and heat shock at 80 degrees Celsius was done in hot water bath
Results: Dilution did not work well (ladder could not be visualized). Digest appeared to work as 3 bands could be seen in last 2 lanes
Adjustments for tomorrow:
Spin down enzymes before using
Overnight digest
