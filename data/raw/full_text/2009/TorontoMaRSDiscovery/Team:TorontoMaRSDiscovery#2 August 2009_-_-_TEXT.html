August 2, 2009
Miniprepped overnight cultures of 1+2 (Sample 3 and 5) and 3+2 (Sample 1 and 2)
Digested these plasmid samples and ran on gel with negative control (straight from fridge)
The 3kbp in the digest of 1+2 Sample 5 was not expected
Comparing the 2 samples of 3+2, the digest of sample 1 did not have a 700bp band, and the undigested sample 1 was about 500bp shorter than the undigested sample 2. We suspect the plasmid in sample 1 did not take up the 3+2 part and somehow recircularized.
Transfected overnight ligations of 7+Enc into DH-5alpha cells and plated onto C plates
