4+5 plates showed 2 big colonies and 1 small colony
Started log phase for 4+5 (1), (2) (did not stock)
3+2 overnights did not grow
They are not C-resistant?
We have to redo the 3+2 ligations
Miniprepped Enc A, B, C, BB3 and BB4
Digested miniprepped samples and also BB2, 1+2 plasmid for 2 hours
Ran digests on a gel
1ug of plasmid was digested for Enc A, B, C, BB2, BB3, BB4; and 1/5 was loaded on to gel (10ul of digest)
30x37.4=1122ng of plasmid was digested for 1+2; and 16.5ul was loaded (1122x16.5/50=370.26ng)
Miniprepped log phase of 4+5 (1), (2)
