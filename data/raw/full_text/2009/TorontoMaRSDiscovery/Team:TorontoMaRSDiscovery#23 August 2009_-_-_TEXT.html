Transfected 4+5, Enc+C (x2) ligations into 1 tube of Calvin's cells (aliquots of 33ul of cells)
plated Enc transformants onto C plates
Since there were no Tet plates, 400ul of tetracyclin was spread onto a plain LB plate and dried, before plating 4+5 transformants
Started overnight cultures of 1+2 and 3+2 in 5ml of LB
