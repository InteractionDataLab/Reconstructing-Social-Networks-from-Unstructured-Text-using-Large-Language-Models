</LI><LI>BB2, 3, 4 appeared to be contaminated as there was no significant increase in absorbency. We suspect the source of contamination was from the pipette tip when adding the ampicillin to the LB. The tip had been used repeatedly.
</LI><LI>Due to the contamination observed, the ampicillin may also have been contaminated. If the same situation occurs again, it may be due to this.
</LI><LI>Miniprepped BB5 ([] = 3.54.4 ng/ul) and froze 2 cryotubes for long term stock

</LI><LI>Gel image (~1hr @ 120 V)
</LI><LI>L1: Ladder - too concentrated (not well resolved) probably because gel was made with 0.5X TBE while loading buffer for gel was 1X TBE - next time use 0.5X 
</LI><LI>L2: BB1 - not resolved, appears to not be fully digested, too much DNA? Appears to be proper plasmid, but a part ran off. Next time run gel for less time (~30 min) 
</LI><LI>L3: BB5 - nothing appeared
</LI><LI>L4: C - looks very faint, add more next time (30 ul instead of 20 ul)
</LI><LI>K - same as C
</LI><LI>Redigested BB5 - followed digestion protocol suggested in BioBrick Assembly Manual
</LI><LI>Digestion mixture: 500 ng plasmid ([BB5] = 328.0 ng/ul, used 1.5 ul), 1 ul EcoRI-HF, Spel each, 10X NE Buffer 2 5 ul, 100X BSA 0.5 ul, made up to 50 ul
</LI><LI>After nearly 4 hours in the incubator, the tet plasmid culture had an absorbency of 0.011. We decided to leave it overnight and to miniprep tomorrow.
</LI></OL><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_7.2C_2009">July 7, 2009</SPAN></H1><OL><LI>Absorbency of tet plasmid this morning = 0.62

</LI><LI>After 30 minutes of running the gel at 97 mV, the bands could be seen but there was not enough separation. We continued to run it. 
</LI><LI>Started overnight culture for BB2, 3, 4 in 100 ul, 130 ul, and 100 ul of LB 
</LI><LI>After 1h 45min, gel was examined: 
</LI><LI>Comparing lanes 2 and 3 (BB1 digested vs. undigested), we conclude that BB1 is the correct size and results of digested are as expected
</LI><LI>Lanes 4, 5 had very faint bands. Since they were digests of BB5 done on Sunday and repeated Monday, we conclude the digestion time may be too long such that most DNA had been degraded
</LI><LI>Lane 6 was undigested BB5; the band shows the DNA sample was not degraded
</LI><LI>Lane 7 and 8 were reruns of C and K plasmids. Although bands were faint, they were the size expected 
</LI><LI>Future adjustments:
</LI><LI>2% agarose was too thick because after running for nearly 2 hr, the separation did not happen. Will try 1.5% agarose next time 
</LI><LI>Digestion time for BB5 should be shortened

</LI></OL><UL><LI>Gel turned out well though there are still problems with the ladder - suggest loading small amount of DNA ladder in a small well
</LI><LI>There is a minimal difference between 1h and 3h digests - suggest we stick with 1h digest in the same conditions. Also, future - if there is a free well, try 30 min digest

</LI><LI> One problem with our elute was greater than the volume of TE we put in for elution. Either there was still wash buffer in the spin column or there was something wrong with the pipetting.
</LI><LI>We redid the mini prep with 50 ul of TE for elution for BB7, Yield was 16.3 ng/ul. Since the yield was so low, we decided to regrow an overnight culture in 5ml of LB and miniprep those tomorrow.
