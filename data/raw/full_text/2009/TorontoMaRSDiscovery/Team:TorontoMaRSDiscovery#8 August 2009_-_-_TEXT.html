BB1 transformants showed many colonies
plates (a plate full of colonies)
-> increasing heat shock to 90s increased efficiency (Note: 3x DNA used in this transformation)
Calvin mentioned he does heat shock for 120s
Calvin also suggested to increase tranformation time, ie. after adding DNA, hold on ice for an hour
DH-5alpha replates all grew on the plates, demonstrating LB can be re-autoclaved and poured as plates
there was no difference between transformants directly plated after adding LB+glucose or incubating for an hour
Miniprepped overnights (1+2) samle 1,2,4, and K
