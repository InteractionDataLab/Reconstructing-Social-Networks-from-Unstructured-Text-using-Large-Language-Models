Tet plates made
Recipe for 200 ml (approx. 10 plates):
2.2 g agar in 200 ml fresh LB
Note: do not re-autoclave LB, it will caramelize!
Recipe for 200 ml LB:
a) 1 g yeast extract
b) 2 g peptotryptone
c) 2 g NaCl
d) 200 ml water
Autoclaved at 11:20 a.m., picked up at 1:15 p.m. and cooled in water bath at 37 degrees Celsius
Added 200 microlitres tetracycline stock (from -20 freezer) to final concentration of 20 microgram/ml
Swirl and poured into prepared, labeled plates
Note: label on plates reads June 3, 2009 but should be June 5, 2009 (8 plates in total - either I overpoured or these plates are a bit larger than I was used to)
Inverted and put in 37 degree incubator to dry
