Miniprepped overnights:
Tet1: Did 2 minipreps, one with normal protocol, one with low copy plasmid protocol
Normal protocol gave a higher yield
Tet with ampicillin: used low copy plasmid protocol, but cell pellet was much bigger therefore got the same yield as Tet1 normal protocol
Digested the 2 samples with higher yields (500ng)
Ran digests on gel, but still couldn't see ccdb gene
Started to doubt restriction enzyme function, therefore redigested Tet H (1ug) and C plasmid (500ng)
(1.5h digests for all digests today)
Ran Tet H and C digests on a gel
A faint ~700bp band was observed in the Tet lane
More plasmid should be used for plasmid digests
Started overnight ligation of 4+5 in Tet backbone
