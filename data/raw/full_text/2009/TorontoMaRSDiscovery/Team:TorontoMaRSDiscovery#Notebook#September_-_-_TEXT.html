September 1, 2009
only 3+2a overnight showed growth
Miniprepped 3+2a
digested 3+2a, 4+5R, 3, 4, 5 with E,P
Transfected EncC+5 and negative control into DH-5 cells, plated on Tet plates
mistakenly tranfected T, K plasmid into DH-5 cells (ccdb gene)
Ran digests on a gel
3+2 still not confirmed, but all 4+5 samples showed expected band
September 2, 2009
Transfected Tet, K (RFP) backbone plasmids and Amp, C (ccdb) plasmids into DH-5alpha cells and DB3.1 cells respectively and plated on appropriate antibiotic plates
Enc+5 showed larger colony -> started overnight
September 3, 2009
only 1+2 (1), (4) showed growth in C
Miniprepped Enc+5, 1+2 (1), (4)
Digested Enc+5 with E,P, 1+2 (1), (4) with E,S, 3+2a with X,P for 1.5h
Ran digests and old Tet digest from Monday on a gel
Forgot to add plasmid to controls
Tet digest still good
Enc+5 digest doesn't have ~900bp band -> not confirmed
Started overnight ligation of 1+2+3+2/Tet
Started overnight cultures: Ampx1, Kx2 Enc+5 x3, Tet, BB7
September 4, 2009
Miniprepped overnight cultures
stocked Amp, K1, K2, and Enc+5 (2), (3), (4)
Digested Enc+5 (1)-(4), K1,2, BB7
Transfected 1+2+3+2 into DH-5 cells (50ul)
left on ice for 2.5h after adding ligation product
incubated on shaker for about 2h
Started overnight of C plasmid (ccdb)
September 5, 2009
Ran a gel of digests from yesterday with controls
Miniprepped C overnight culture
Tet plate (Tet with RFP) showed 2 red colonies
September 7, 2009
Digested C plasmid and redigested Enc+5 (1), (3), K1, K2
Started Tet1, Tet2 overnight culture
September 8, 2009
Ran a gel of the digests
Enc+5 band still not showing may have to religate
K and C plasmids digests showed inserts
Started log phase culture for Tet1, Tet2
1+2+3+2 plate still hasn't shown any colonies
Digested 1+2, 3+2, Enc for assembly
Ran digests on a gel
Started overnight ligation of 1+2+Enc, 1+2+3+2 in K1
September 9, 2009
Transfected cells with overnight ligations
2 samples per ligation
Plated and grew overnight at 37C
September 10, 2009
Saw lots of growth on plates (no red colonies yet)
Prepared 10 overnight growth placed in incubator at 30C in K antibiotics
put plates back in incubator at 37C
September 11, 2009
Overnight cultures (x5) were miniprepped
September 12, 2009
Started 20h digest of miniprepped samples
September 13, 2009
Ran digests and negative controls on gel, but no bands at all were seen.
September 14, 2009
Started overnight cultures of same 5 samples
September 15, 2009
only 1232 (3) showed growth, miniprepped
started overnight cultures of for 1232 (2), (4), 12E (2) and EncY
September 16, 2009
Only EncY showed growth, miniprepped
picked streaks of cells from 12E plates and 1232 plates (2 streaks per plate) and started overnights along with controls
Target cells: 1232 mix1, 1232 mix2, 12E mix1, 12E mix2
Controls:
positive control: no antibiotics
negative control: Kanamycin and LB
control control: LB only
September 17, 2009
1232 mix1, 2 and 12E mix2 showed growth
PCRed EncY plasmid and ran on gel
a huge ~700bp band was seen
Prepared EncY for sequencing
September 18, 2009
Digested 1232 (3), 1+2, 7, EncY, K
Ran digests on gel
7 did not show up on gel
Enc band was faint/did not show up
September 19, 2009
12E replates showed some colonies -> started overnights: 12E a,b,c,d,e
started overnight culture for EncY
1232 replates showed many colonies:
1232 (1) had all pink colonies (does NOT contain insert)
1232 (2) had no pink colonies (contains insert)
These plates were stored in the fridge
September 20, 2009
Miniprepped overnights except 12E (which did not show any growth in LB with antibiotics)
Digested 7,K, EncY, 12E a,b,d,e
Ran digests on gel
only Enc was confirmed on this gel
Started K1 overnight
September 24, 2009
Made a new batch of chemically competent cells
poured cells into 50ml falcon tubes
350ul aliquots + 350ul 40% glycerol
Started 12E overnights from transfections done yesterday
Named: 1-5, a-e, but these have been used already, hence 1-5 were renamed 6-10, a-e renamed f-j
Transformed ligation from Monday and negative control into new cells and plated on new K plates
September 25, 2009
Miniprepped 12E 6-10, f-j
overnights from 9,10,g,i had almost no growth (confirmed after 1st centriugation step: did not miniprep)
Digested miniprepes and ran on gel -> no bands
Started overnights again
September 26, 2009
Only 12E (6),f,j,h
Digested minipreps
Ran a gel
September 28, 2009
Started 5ml overnight cultures of 6,f,j,h with kanamycin
added 5ul in 25ml LB then separated into 4 aliquots (1 aliquot left over)
September 29, 2009
took 400ul aliquots of the 4 samples for storage as stocks
Miniprepped the rest of the samples
Ran gel saw no colonies
Rechecked plates: lack of red colonies is suspicious
DH5 may be somewhat resistant to K (suggested by Calvin)
May need to gel extract backbone and parts before ligation
We are out of K plates; need to make more
