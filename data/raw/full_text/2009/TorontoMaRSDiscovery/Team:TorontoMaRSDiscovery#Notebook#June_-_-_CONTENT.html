</LI><LI>to use 25 ul of plasmid miniprep
</LI><LI> we think it is bizarre that a plasmid that is supposed to be et resistant up to 150 ug/ml will not grow in culture at 10ug/ml of et. Since we are selecting this plasmid particularly for its et resistance for use in assembly we feel it would be best to discard this culture and pick another well from the item library perhaps 8A or 15 A. Decided not to proceed with enzyme digest.
