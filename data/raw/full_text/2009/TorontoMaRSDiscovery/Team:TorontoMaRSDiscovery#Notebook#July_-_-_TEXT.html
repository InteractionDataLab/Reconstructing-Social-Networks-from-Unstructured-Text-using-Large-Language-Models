July 1st, 2009
Started overnight culture of BB1 in 25 ml of LB
July 2nd, 2009
Made fresh litre of LB
started log growth of BB1
1ml of overnight in 100 ml of Autoclaved LB with 100ul of stock amp solution
incubating at 37C
started overnight culture of BB2, 3, 4, 5, and pSB1AT3 in 25 ml of LB per colony /  plate
miniprepped BB1 -=> 64.8ng/ul. Stored in the -20 fridge
made 2 tubes of BB1 stock w/ glycerol, stored in -80 freezer
July 3, 2009
Started log phase growth for BB2, 3, 4, 5 in 100 ml of LB with Amp (100 ul)
BB2, 3, 4 appeared to be contaminated as there was no significant increase in absorbency. We suspect the source of contamination was from the pipette tip when adding the ampicillin to the LB. The tip had been used repeatedly.
Due to the contamination observed, the ampicillin may also have been contaminated. If the same situation occurs again, it may be due to this.
Miniprepped BB5 ([] = 3.54.4 ng/ul) and froze 2 cryotubes for long term stock
July 5, 2009
C plasmid mislabelled
Overnight of 2, 3, 4 tet started
1, 5, C, Kan were digested - 250 ng of DNA
overnight @ 37 degrees celcius
July 6, 2009
2, 3, 4 overnight cultures did not grow well - replated 2, 3, 4 on new Amp plates
Gel image (~1hr @ 120 V)
L1: Ladder - too concentrated (not well resolved) probably because gel was made with 0.5X TBE while loading buffer for gel was 1X TBE - next time use 0.5X
L2: BB1 - not resolved, appears to not be fully digested, too much DNA? Appears to be proper plasmid, but a part ran off. Next time run gel for less time (~30 min)
L3: BB5 - nothing appeared
L4: C - looks very faint, add more next time (30 ul instead of 20 ul)
K - same as C
Redigested BB5 - followed digestion protocol suggested in BioBrick Assembly Manual
Digestion mixture: 500 ng plasmid ([BB5] = 328.0 ng/ul, used 1.5 ul), 1 ul EcoRI-HF, Spel each, 10X NE Buffer 2 5 ul, 100X BSA 0.5 ul, made up to 50 ul
After nearly 4 hours in the incubator, the tet plasmid culture had an absorbency of 0.011. We decided to leave it overnight and to miniprep tomorrow.
July 7, 2009
Absorbency of tet plasmid this morning = 0.62
Made 2 cryotubes of stock (put in -80 freezer), miniprepped [] = 56.4 ng/ul
After 30 minutes of running the gel at 97 mV, the bands could be seen but there was not enough separation. We continued to run it.
Started overnight culture for BB2, 3, 4 in 100 ul, 130 ul, and 100 ul of LB
After 1h 45min, gel was examined:
Comparing lanes 2 and 3 (BB1 digested vs. undigested), we conclude that BB1 is the correct size and results of digested are as expected
Lanes 4, 5 had very faint bands. Since they were digests of BB5 done on Sunday and repeated Monday, we conclude the digestion time may be too long such that most DNA had been degraded
Lane 6 was undigested BB5; the band shows the DNA sample was not degraded
Lane 7 and 8 were reruns of C and K plasmids. Although bands were faint, they were the size expected
Future adjustments:
2% agarose was too thick because after running for nearly 2 hr, the separation did not happen. Will try 1.5% agarose next time
Digestion time for BB5 should be shortened
July 8, 2009
Started log phase growth for BB2, 3, 4
Transfected DB3.1 cells with BB6 (R0040) and the operation vector (pSB3C5) and plated them on appropriate antibiotic plates
Miniprepped BB2, 3, 4 from overnight culture
BB2, 3, 4 stocked in cryotubes with glycerol from log phase culture
Poured 8 Amp plates
July 9, 2009
Digested BB2, 3, 4, tet, and 5 for 1h and 3h
Plated BB1, 5, C, K from stock tubes
Transfected cell plates from yesterday did not show any colonies. We therefore plated the remaining liquid culture (stored at 4 degrees Celsius) onto appropriate antibiotic plkates
Ran a gel of the digests
Loaded 20 ul of sample in each well
Used all of 50 ml agarose + TBE to make gel to make deep wells
1h digests were kept on ice while waiting for 3h digests
DNA ladder was heat shocked at 60 degrees Celsius for 3 min before mixing with dye and TBE
Gel turned out well though there are still problems with the ladder - suggest loading small amount of DNA ladder in a small well
There is a minimal difference between 1h and 3h digests - suggest we stick with 1h digest in the same conditions. Also, future - if there is a free well, try 30 min digest
July 10, 2009
All 4 replates from yesterday grew colonies (1, 5, C, K), indicating our stock tubes do indeed contain the plasmids
Replated BB2, 3, 4, Tet from stock tubes
Digested BB1, 2, 5 and ran on 1.3% TAE gel with 100 bp DNA ladder
10 min and 1h digests don't show a big difference and we should try a 10 min digest in future
BB1 appears to have contaminations as the top band was not at expected location
BB5 did not appear on the gel again. We suspect the plasmids are contaminated with DNase or other proteins. We will run another gel with undigested BB5 after incubating @ 37 C on Monday
The small fragments of the biobricks were not seen on the gel. Austin said this was expected.
July 13, 2009
Replates of BB2, 3, 4, Tet are growing well
Started overnight culture of BB6 and 0 with antibiotics
Transfected DH5-a cells with BB7, BB1, 5 and TM0785 and plated on Amp plates (2 plates for each BB)
July 14, 2009
Ran a gel for PCR products & undigested BB5
started overnight for TM0785, BB1, 6,5, and replated BB7
July 15, 2009
started overnight for 5
started log phase growth for 5
miniprepped log phase culture
stocked 2 cryotubes of 1
made a mix of 100 bp ladder and buffer
Ran a PCR reaction for sample showed non-specific band and run on a gel
Digested Mini-prepped TM0285 and ran on gel
pour digest will redo tomorrow
July 16, 2009
ran 1st PCR according to protocol, increased MgCl2 by 0.5mmol
ran a TD-PCR reaction
Ran a 2nd PCR, with more primer (used 0.5)
Ran another TD PCR in same conditions as befoe
Ran a negative control for PCR, which included everything except template.
July 17, 2009
Ran a gel for PCR P5 + N6
ran a gel for BB1 BB5 and TM0785
miniprepped BB7 from log phase
Made stock of BB7 as well
July 20, 2009
Overnight PCR in PCR machine --> gDNA --> TD
Completed Day 1 assemblies for the control module 1+2, 3+2, and 4+5
2+3 and 4+5 ligations, we change the
we also transfected DN5 cells with all of the ligate instead of 2ul suggested by the NEB protocol
July 21, 2009
PCR of gDNA was successful 800bp band was observed on the 1.3% TAE agarose gel with the 100 bp ladder
A second gel was run with the rest of the product
however the well  loaded into was broken and some of the sample was lost/ spread into 2 adjacent wells (see pic)
and excised sample was taken and purified. It was nanodropped at 11.1ng/ul
BB7 was digested an run in lane 3 however no bands were visible
K and C plates were poured and are drying in the incubator
assembly plates were checked, however no growth was visible (there were weird bumps on the plate that maybe colonies but they looked weird will review tomorrow)
July 22, 2009
digested + ligated encapsulin into a C backbone and transformed DH5 stocks
re-plated left over 1+2 and 3+2 and 4+5
July 23, 2009
observed july 22 plates --> no growth
suggest redoing digest
digesting Encapsulin
run gel to observe
Due to lack of band in the C plasmid digest a libation was not preformed. The encapsulin digest will be stored in a 4C fridge for the next day
Lack of a band in both C plasmid lanes
Contamination
Lack of DNA
small volume loaded = no DNA?
July 24, 2009
Digested C and K plasmids with EcoRI and PstI in the PCR machine
Also prepared negative controls
Ran Digest and controls on gel / 100bp lader and HindIII digest
C plasmid could be observed with a expected 3k band
K plasmid digest did not yield a band
Started overnight for encapsulin transfected cells
July 27, 2009
Digested encapsulin plasmid and BB7 plasmid with -ve controls and straight from fridge control
imaged gel showed nothing in the digest lane and a weak signal from the bands in the control lanes
Also through discussion with calvin it was discovered that our mini preps are producing really low yields of plasmid
Also through discussion with Calving we have determined that we should do future ligations in smaller volumes, Ligation reactions do NOT scale up well as our plates showed no colonies.
Started overnights of BB1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Tet, C
July 28, 2009
miniprepped BB1, 5, 7, C and Tet but yield was very low ~20ng/ul
Calvin also miniprepped one sample for us to see if our miniprep kit was the problem. His miniprep idled 45 ng/ml
One problem with our elute was greater than the volume of TE we put in for elution. Either there was still wash buffer in the spin column or there was something wrong with the pipetting.
We redid the mini prep with 50 ul of TE for elution for BB7, Yield was 16.3 ng/ul. Since the yield was so low, we decided to regrow an overnight culture in 5ml of LB and miniprep those tomorrow.
July 29, 2009
Ran gel with PCR encapsulin and gel extract [] of 11.0 ng/ul was obtained
Ran gel with K plasmid from storage found a sufficient [] however there was no ladder and the length is questionable.
Ran minipreps on 1, 3, 4, 5, Tet and C.
changed protocol to use 5mL of overnight culture
great yield eluted w/ 50 ul of TE
digested BB 4+5 and doing overnight ligations in the PCR machine at 16C
ran gel of 4+5 digests
July 30, 2009
at the end of the day a gel was run and all bands were consistent and a great improvement to our initial gels i.e. May/June. Ladders did not show due to Kenny forgetting to add the ladder to the stock.
earlier in the day we took the ligation of 4+5 and encapsulin and transformed the DH5 with them. The encapsulin transformants were done in a pBSK plasmid and plated on a gal + IPTG + LB + amp plate. 30 ul of IPTG and 50 ul of gal and 50ul of LB were mixed and spread on an Amp plate. The transformants were then plated onto.
4+5 transformants were plated on OLD (Jul. 3) tet plates.
A ligation of 1+2 and 3+2 was performed and is in Rommens PCR machine 3 for tomorrow.
July 31, 2009
Transfected 2ul of 1+2 and 3+2 ligation prduct into 25 ul of competent cells each. Plated on Amp plates
ran a gel with the ligation products (10ul)
