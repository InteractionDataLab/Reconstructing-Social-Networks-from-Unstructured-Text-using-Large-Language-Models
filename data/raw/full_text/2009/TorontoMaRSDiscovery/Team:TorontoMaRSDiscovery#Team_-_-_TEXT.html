Dr. John Parkinson
Dr. John Parkinson aka The Dragon in the Dragon's Den
Graduated from the University of Bath with a bachelor of science in Applied Biology in 1990. After receiving a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Manchester in 1995, I completed a NATO fellowship at the University of Manitoba. From 1997 to 2000, I was awarded a fellowship at the Edinburgh Centre for Protein Technology, University of Edinburgh and from 2000 to 2003 completed another fellowship at the University of Edinburgh on Nematode genomics. I am currently a scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute.  The research in our laboratory is aimed at understanding how molecular information can give rise to complex biological behaviour. Using computational methods, we study the organization and dynamics of cellular components within the context of integrated biological systems. Comparative genomics methods are also being applied to provide insights into how these systems may have evolved from the remote origins of life.
Graham Cromar
Graham Cromar aka The Wizard of Id
I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Molecular Structure and Function at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.  At various times in the past I have studied cell and molecular biology (B.Sc. Toronto), molecular biology and genetics (M.Sc. Guelph), computer programming and systems analysis (dip. Inst. Computer Studies, Toronto), bioinformatics (cert. Canadian Genetic Disease Network) and, systems and matrix biology (present).  I have worked as a lab technician, teaching assistant, computer programmer/systems analyst and IS manager.  But, what I would most like to do is what I wrote in my high school yearbook about 20 years ago... Design organisms for export to far away galaxies.  Thanks to iGEM I'm 1/4 of the way there...
Stacy Hung
Stacy Hung aka Mini Wheats
With a B.Sc. Honours Biology and Bioinformatics from the University of Waterloo, Stacy is currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto.  Her main focus is to identify novel enzyme drug targets against malaria by studying the metabolic networks of these parasites.  She is inspired by anything that is new, exciting, and can have a long-term impact for making the world a better place -- besides her research, iGEM is certainly one of these things!
Daniel Wong
Daniel Wong aka The Architect
Daniel Wong received his BASc in Engineering Science biomedical option at the University of Toronto.  He is currently with the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, working toward his PhD.  He works in the Cochlear Implant Laboratory at the Hospital for Sick Children, developing neuroimaging algorithms for the analysis of multichannel EEG data.  As design team lead for this year's iGEM team, he guided the design team in developing the protocols for creating the team's biobrick parts.  His academic interests include neuroimaging and systems modelling.  To relax, he enjoys a good round of golf or social salsa dancing.
Natalie Yeung
Natalie Yeung aka The Strategist
I'm a graduate student at the University of Toronto's iSchool (sometimes known as the Faculty of Information). Having been involved in iGEM previously, it's been my privilege to see other people catch the synthetic biology bug each year. This team is a great example of the creativity of multidisciplinary groups, as well as iGEM's potential to be a catalyst for innovation (and some great stories!).
Conrad Lochovsky
Conrad Lochovsky aka The Invisible Man
Conrad Lochovsky completed his BASc in Biomedical Engineering in Toronto and is currently pursuing his MASc in the exciting area of microfluidics.  With a minor in Economics, Conrad played a very important role as our treasurer.  He has also been involved with past Toronto iGEM teams: 2006(design/lab), 2007(design/lab/finance) and is active on the executive of several other campus clubs.
Students
Yen Leung
Yen Leung aka Elastigirl
Yen Leung has been an invaluable member of the iGem Wet lab team. She has always been around the lab helping out, doing experiments and keeping my (Kenny) craziness (when I come up with crazy ideas) and messiness in check. Currently Yen is pursuing a specialist degree in Nutrition and Neuroscience at the University of Toronto and in September '09 she will be entering her third year.
Kenny Zhan
Kenny Zhan aka Mad Scientist
Hi everyone my name is Kenny Zhan and I am a third year undergraduate student. I am currently pursuing a specialization in biochemistry at the University of Toronto. This year I have been part of the iGEM design team at UofT and during the summer I have been fortunate enough to be part of the roster team  that works in the lab to bring the design into reality. I find synthetic biology fascinating as I have an interest in developing new techniques and procedures to support the rapidly expanding field of biological sciences. In my free time I enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, ultimate and geocaching. Also you will see me from time to time updating our lab wiki. Hope to see you all down at the jamboree in Boston come October.
Meah Gao
Meah Gao aka The Bionic Woman
Hi everyone! I am currently a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto specializing in Pathobiology and majoring in Cell and Systems biology. This year as part of the Toronto Mars Discovery iGEM team, my job is to apply bioinformatics methods to identify potential protein candidates for enzymatic channeling and explore alternative microcompartment platforms. Previously, I have also been involved in projects in Neurophysiology and Cellular & Molecular Biology. My current research interest lies in genomics studies using bioinformatics tools.
James Juras
James Juras aka The Sporatic Action Man
Hey there, I'm a virgo and enjoy long snowboarding adventures in the mountains. Also in my spare time I'm a 4th year undergraduate specializing in Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. This summer I've been doing lots of work all over the place, but mainly my job has been to design the wiki you're presently navigating.
