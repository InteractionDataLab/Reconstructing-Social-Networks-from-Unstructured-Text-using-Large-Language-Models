August 1, 2009
Overnight encapsulin cultures 1 and 6 (randomly selected) and the negative control were miniprepped
The rest of the encapsulin cultures were stocked with 20% glycerol
6 digestions were done: Enc1, Enc6, Enc -ve, BB5, BB7, and C
16ul of BB5 plasmid was used
500ng of plasmid were used for the others
The digestions were run on a 1.3% agarose gel in TAE
BB5 was confirmed and all other parts were correct as well
Overnight ligation of 7+Enc in the PCR machine
August 2, 2009
Miniprepped overnight cultures of 1+2 (Sample 3 and 5) and 3+2 (Sample 1 and 2)
Digested these plasmid samples and ran on gel with negative control (straight from fridge)
The 3kbp in the digest of 1+2 Sample 5 was not expected
Comparing the 2 samples of 3+2, the digest of sample 1 did not have a 700bp band, and the undigested sample 1 was about 500bp shorter than the undigested sample 2. We suspect the plasmid in sample 1 did not take up the 3+2 part and somehow recircularized.
Transfected overnight ligations of 7+Enc into DH-5alpha cells and plated onto C plates
August 3, 2009
No colonies were found on 7+Enc plates
August 4, 2009
Started overnight cultures of BB1+2 sample 1,2, 4 and K stocks
Digested BB4, BB5 and C plasmid, and ran them on a gel
All bands were of expected sizes.
Started overnight ligation of 4+5 into C plasmid
August 5, 2009
Transfected overnight ligation and plated them on C plates
Plated new C plates (probably meant poured)
Miniprepped overnight cultures of BB1+2 and K plasmid
August 6, 2009
Digested BB1+2 Samples 1,2,4 and K plasmid with restriction enzymes EcoR1 and Pst1
The digests along with negative controls were ran on a gel
The 1+2 insert was not seen on the gel, probably because it is too small
The ccdb gene (~600bp) was not seen on the gel
August 7, 2009
Started overnight cultures of 1+2 sample 1,2,4
Retransformed BB1 using the iGEM 2007 Toronto team's protocol (heat shock for 90s) and plated on Amp plates
Plated DH5alpha cells as a control on plain LB plates
This is thumotoga maritime genomic DNA for purpose of re-cloning
Microcentrifuge tubes 1 and 2 placed in -20 freezer
August 8, 2009
BB1 transformants showed many colonies
plates (a plate full of colonies)
-> increasing heat shock to 90s increased efficiency (Note: 3x DNA used in this transformation)
Calvin mentioned he does heat shock for 120s
Calvin also suggested to increase tranformation time, ie. after adding DNA, hold on ice for an hour
DH-5alpha replates all grew on the plates, demonstrating LB can be re-autoclaved and poured as plates
there was no difference between transformants directly plated after adding LB+glucose or incubating for an hour
Miniprepped overnights (1+2) samle 1,2,4, and K
August 10, 2009
Digested plasmid samples miniprepped on Sat (1,2,4,K) and Enc, C plasmid with EcoR1 and Pst1
Ran a gel for the digests
(1+2) Sample 1 appeared to have a ~100bp band
K plasmid digest did not show the ccdb gene (~700bp) - will start another culture with antibiotics
Started overnight cultures of (1+2) Sample 1
August 11, 2009
Digested 4, 5, Enc, C(E+P), C(X+S)
BB4 did not digest
5, C is stored in fridge
Calvin suggested increasing the concentration of enzyme and increase time of digestion due to thawing enzymes over weekend in fridge
Miniprepped 1+2(1) with new kit, got great yield ~100ng/ul
Gel extracted C (X+S) after it was CIPed
Overnight ligation of Enc+C in PCR machine
Calvin gave us 2 vials of RbCl cells in -80C
one time use only
thaw and add DNA
August 12, 2009
Transformed Enc+C ligations
Digested BB4 again
Started overnight ligation of 4+5
started overnight culture of BB7
Problem was found in C plates: too soft
not enough agar?
August 14, 2009
Miniprepped 5, 7, C with normal protocol of BioBasics Kit
Results were low ~30ng/ul
Digested C and CIPed it
Ran 4 digest and plasmid samples of 5, 7, C and the CIPed C plasmid samples of 5, 7, C and the CIPed C plasmid
Gel extracted CIPed C plasmid
Ligated 4+5 and Enc into C plasmid and plated
August 16, 2009
Started overnight culture for BB5, 7, C
August 17, 2009
Miniprepped overnight cultures of 5, 7, C
7 sample had a very low yield
started another overnight for & and will miniprep again tomorrow

Ran gel of C, K, Tet digests
Miniprepped 4+5 overnight cultures -> 4+5?
Started overnight cultures of Tet and a negative control
August 21, 2009
No growth of negative Tet overnight culture
Tet overnights were miniprepped
Digested 4+5?, Tet, and TetX with (EcoR1 and Pst1)
The digests were run on a gel with negative controls
None of the samples were confirmed
Started overnights for Tet plasmid, 2 with tetracyclin and 1 with ampicillin
August 22, 2009
Miniprepped overnights:
Tet1: Did 2 minipreps, one with normal protocol, one with low copy plasmid protocol
Normal protocol gave a higher yield
Tet with ampicillin: used low copy plasmid protocol, but cell pellet was much bigger therefore got the same yield as Tet1 normal protocol
Digested the 2 samples with higher yields (500ng)
Ran digests on gel, but still couldn't see ccdb gene
Started to doubt restriction enzyme function, therefore redigested Tet H (1ug) and C plasmid (500ng)
(1.5h digests for all digests today)
Ran Tet H and C digests on a gel
A faint ~700bp band was observed in the Tet lane
More plasmid should be used for plasmid digests
Started overnight ligation of 4+5 in Tet backbone
August 23, 2009
Transfected 4+5, Enc+C (x2) ligations into 1 tube of Calvin's cells (aliquots of 33ul of cells)
plated Enc transformants onto C plates
Since there were no Tet plates, 400ul of tetracyclin was spread onto a plain LB plate and dried, before plating 4+5 transformants
Started overnight cultures of 1+2 and 3+2 in 5ml of LB
August 24, 2009
Replated left over cells
Miniprepped 1+2 overnights, yielded ~40ng/ul

August 26, 2009
4+5 plates showed 2 big colonies and 1 small colony

3+2 overnights did not grow
They are not C-resistant?
We have to redo the 3+2 ligations
