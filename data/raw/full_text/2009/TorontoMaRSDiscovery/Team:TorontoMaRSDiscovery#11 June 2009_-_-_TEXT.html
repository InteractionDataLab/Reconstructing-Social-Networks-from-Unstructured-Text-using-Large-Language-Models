We did not have enough isolated plasmid DNA to justify doing another gel so we decided to perform another gel so we decided to perform another miniprep to get some more
Used DB3.1 transformed bacteria from shaker(measured spec 0.794)
Miniprep
potential issue our microcentrifuge only spins @ 10,000 not required 12,000
Binding DNA
did both optional steps preheated TE + washed w/ W10
measured UV absorbance = 4.2ng/ul
in all there is ~ 74 ul of TE should indicated ~370 ng of plasmid.
Digest
NOTE: plasmid length w/e biobric is 3189 bp biobrick length is 3255bp this can explain lack of 2 clear bands on gel after ligation.
nevertheless, we will perform another Gel to make sure we can properly run ladder to determine fragment sizes
digest measurements: 250ng plasmid all else half except BSA
