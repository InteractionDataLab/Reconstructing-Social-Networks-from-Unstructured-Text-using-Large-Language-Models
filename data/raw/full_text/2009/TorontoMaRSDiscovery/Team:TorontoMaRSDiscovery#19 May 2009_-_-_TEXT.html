2L of TE buffer made (10X TE)
Recipe for 2L from stock solution (10X TE)
a) 10 ml 1M Tris-HCl pH 7.5-80.0 x 2 = 20 ml
b) 2 ml 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0 x 2 = 4 ml
c) 988 ml ddH20 x 2 = 1976 ml
To make Tris-HCl, Tris base is used and adjusted to desired pH using HCl
1 M Tris base is required of which 20 ml is required – thereby 2.4228 g Tris base (due to scale limitations, 2.42g of Tris Base was used
500 ml of 1 M Tris Base made
mass of Tris used = 1M/1000 ml x 500 ml x 121.14 g/mol = 60.57 g
volume of water used = 500 ml
250 ml of 0.5 M EDTA solution was made
mass of EDTA used = 36.53 g
observations: EDTA did not dissolve in ddH2O on heat and being stirred
