October 1, 2009
Miniprepped Tet, 5, EncY, C
Ran minipreps and K plasmid on a gel
Besides Tet, all samples looked fine
Poured K plates
October 2, 2009
Digested K, EncY and ran on gel
October 3, 2009
Digested EncY and old Tet plasmid -> ran on gel
EncY looked fine, but Tet did not show up on gel
Started overnight culture of Tet
October 4, 2009
Miniprepped, digested Tet and ran on gel
Tet was confirmed
gel extracted EncY, Tet and got low yields
Started overnight ligations
1: Digested Tet + EncY + 5
2: Gel extraced Tet + Digested EncY + 5
negative controls were Tet plasmid alone
October 8, 2009
October 9, 2009
Miniprepped EncY overnight and digested with E,P
Ran digest on a gel
Enc part confirmed
Transfected Enc+5 ligations from Sunday/Monday into competent cells from Invitrogen
Used NEB Hight Efficiency Transformation Protocol C2987
did one 10-fold dilution
transformed 5ul of DNA
spread 100ul of cells on plate
shaker/incubator speed 232rpm
October 11, 2009
Checked plates, no colonies yet
Picked colonies and started overnights from an old 12E plate that wasn't checked: 12E i,ii,iii
October 13, 2009
12E i and iii showed growth -> miniprepped
Digested and ran on 1% agarose gel
Stained gel for 1 hour in EtBr+buffer
A faint ~700 band was observed! This could possibly be the 1+2+Enc insert that we want.
To confirm the insert, we decided to sequence it
October 15, 2009
Primers for sequencing 12E insert was designed and ordered
October 16, 2009
EncY prepped and ready to ship down to MIT to submit part to registry
