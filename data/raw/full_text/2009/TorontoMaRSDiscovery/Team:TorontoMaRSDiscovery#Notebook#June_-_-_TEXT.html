Plasmid transformed = pSB1AC3 (TEST)
Note: team members were of mixed opinion as to whether the transform was likely due to low availability of DNA - DNA was split between a number of transformation reactions for at least 2 different DB3.1 strains. Plates incubated at 30 degrees Celsius overnight, temp. raised to 37 degrees approx. 10:30 a.m.
June 5, 2009
Tet plates made
Recipe for 200 ml (approx. 10 plates):
2.2 g agar in 200 ml fresh LB
Note: do not re-autoclave LB, it will caramelize!
Recipe for 200 ml LB:
a) 1 g yeast extract
b) 2 g peptotryptone
c) 2 g NaCl
d) 200 ml water
Autoclaved at 11:20 a.m., picked up at 1:15 p.m. and cooled in water bath at 37 degrees Celsius
Added 200 microlitres tetracycline stock (from -20 freezer) to final concentration of 20 microgram/ml
Swirl and poured into prepared, labeled plates
Note: label on plates reads June 3, 2009 but should be June 5, 2009 (8 plates in total - either I overpoured or these plates are a bit larger than I was used to)
Inverted and put in 37 degree incubator to dry
June 8, 2009
Bacteria grown to log phase using sterile inoculating loop to inoculate approx. 200 ml of LB media with bacteria from 2 plates (approx. 3 colonies)
Bacterial liquid culture placed in shaker at 10:51 a.m.
June 9, 2009
Digested miniprepped gel with EcoRI and SpeI
Running gel to see if correct plasmid was purified - should expect to see bands at ~3200 bp
DNA Ladder made - 6 microlitres of stock used
June 10, 2009
Poured 10 Tet plates following procedure on June 5, 2009
Due to problems with DNA ladder and restriction enzyme digest yesterday, procedures were followed again today with the following adjustments
DNA was diluted and run on lanes 1-5 of gel:
Lane 1 - 1X
Lane 2 - 1/6X
Lane 3 - 1/36X
Lane 4 - 1/10X
Lane 5 - 1/100X
Restriction enzyme digest was repeated with an incubation time of 4 h at 37 degrees Celsius and heat shock at 80 degrees Celsius was done in hot water bath
Results: Dilution did not work well (ladder could not be visualized). Digest appeared to work as 3 bands could be seen in last 2 lanes
Adjustments for tomorrow:
Spin down enzymes before using
Overnight digest
June 11, 2009
We did not have enough isolated plasmid DNA to justify doing another gel so we decided to perform another gel so we decided to perform another miniprep to get some more
Used DB3.1 transformed bacteria from shaker(measured spec 0.794)
Miniprep
potential issue our microcentrifuge only spins @ 10,000 not required 12,000
Binding DNA
did both optional steps preheated TE + washed w/ W10
measured UV absorbance = 4.2ng/ul
in all there is ~ 74 ul of TE should indicated ~370 ng of plasmid.
Digest
NOTE: plasmid length w/e biobric is 3189 bp biobrick length is 3255bp this can explain lack of 2 clear bands on gel after ligation.
nevertheless, we will perform another Gel to make sure we can properly run ladder to determine fragment sizes
digest measurements: 250ng plasmid all else half except BSA
June 12, 2009
Ran Gel
Ladder and other bands were able to be visualized however were still a little wonky
Suggests for improvement
increase the glycerol [] in loading dye as there have been problems with diffusion when loading samples as the solution is not falling into the wells
June 15, 2009
made 1ml and 200ul aliquotes of Kanamycin 10mg/ml stock and stored at -20C
Recipe: 250ug Kanamycin + 25ml sterile water
USE : 2x200ul for final working concentration of 20ug/ml
Trouble shooting ladder
it was noted that the 1x TBE buffer recipe was off. The recipe that we were using called for too much Boric acid. After reviewing the literature a new recipe which contained:
54g of Tris base
27.5g of Boric Acid
20ml of 0.5 M EDTA (ph 8.0)
800ml ddH2O
It is also recommended that we discard our 1x TBE and 10x TBE stocks.
=June 16, 2009+
poured 8 K plates and 8 C plates. Followed protocol of "pouring agar plates with antibiotics"
Antibiotic amounts ere calculated:
Kanamycin
working concentration = 20ug/ul
amount required = 20 ug/ml X 200ul = 4000 ug = 4mg
stock [] = 10 mg/ml
volume of stock required = (4mg/10mg)*1ml = 0.4ml = 400ul
400ul/200ul = 2 aliquots of 200 ul required
Chloramphnicol
working concentration = 25ug/ul
amount required = 25 ug/ml X 200ul = 5000 ug = 4mg
stock [] = 25 mg/ml
volume of stock required = (5mg/25mg)*1ml = 0.2ml = 200ul
200ul/200ul = 1 aliquot of 200 ul required
June 17,2009
Due to mix up of # of aliquots yesterday, we poured 8 more plates of K and 8 more plates of C this time at the correct concentrations.
received the new DNA ladder, and we ran it on a gel to compare with the old ladder.
June 18, 2009
Transformed first 2 plasmid backbones in the biobrick assembly procedure pSB1AC3 and pSB1AT3
Note;
We used sorval tubes when adding LV and Glucose and incubating on the shaker
We flamed the spreader to sterilize it before spreading the cells on the agar + antibiotic plate.
Made up 50 ml of LV + 20mM glucose for future use and will place in fridge tomorrow if there is no bacterial growth after storing at room temperature for a day.
will grow cells up to log phase tomorrow for miniprep and freezing
left over cells from incubation on shaker were stored in the 4 degree fridge over night
June 21, 2009
Inoculated 1 colony from each plate of transformed DB3.1 cells into 50 ml of LB
Placed the flasks in the shaker to grow an overnight culture
THere were no obvious colonies on the Tet. plate. Instead the cells seemed to be spread out over a large area, this maybe due to the low temperature when the plates were poured=== the agar was already polymerizing resulting in an uneven surface.
A small area of cells in the Tet plates were inoculated.
June 22, 2009
inoculated the overnight culture into antibiotic-containing LB medium and grew to log phase
Cells incubated at 40 celcius grew considerably quicker than cells incubated at 37 celcius:
After a growing time of 5.5 hours  the absorbance of Tet and Camp were doubled.
the Tet cells did not grow well in antibiotics ths they were left in the incubator and not frozen or refrigerated.
C cells were frozen down in 2 cryotubes in a final glycerol concentration of 20%
June 23, 2009
DB 3.1 was transformed with backbone plasmid pSB1AK3 and plated on premade K plates
Tet plates were remade as well
K and Tet plates were placed in the incubator
Mini-preped 40 C Chloroamphenicol observed a result of 72.7ng/ul in a total of 75 ul
plates were placed in the incubator
June 24, 2009
Amp plates were poured 500 ul of Amp stock / 500 ul
K plates doing well colonies observed
Tet plates not so good spotted maybe 1 colony
transformed DB3.1 with BB1 ad BB2
plated them on amp plates.
June 25, 2009
Oberseved plates in incubator
K plates:  ready for overnight
et plates: shows 1 or 2 colonies
Amp 1 + Amp 2 plate: Very few colonies
Transformation efficiency of flash frozen EtOH cells seems to be low (rom obs only)
June 26, 2009
Transformed BB5 to DB 3.1 Cells and plated on 2 K plates
Overnight cutter of pSB1AK3 plasmid was inoculated to a liquid LB medium and grown to log phase for Mini-prep and freezing down.
Miniprepped pSB1AK3 stored in -20 fridge
stocked cells stored in the -80 freezer
June 29, 2009
All plates were looked at and were all growing okay
all plates were moved to the lab bench to sow down bacterial growth
An overnight growth of all the et resistant plasmid was started
this needs to be minipreped and frozen down after log growth
The rest of the plates should be left on the bench till thursday
miniprep kits labelled with simple / basic instructions
full instructions were left in the protocol binder.
log growth requires antibiotics at a same concentration as the agar
If no growth in log phase culture there is a replete in the incubator on the mid-shelf
June 30, 2009
removed overnights of et resistant plasmids from the incubator
placed autoclaved LB from 4 degree fridge at 37C water bath to warm for 30 min
inoculated 2x100 ml LB each with 2ml of overnight culture
incubate with shaking at 40C
if they grow then stock cells in the freezer
plasmid mini-prep
decided to do minipres of both tubes in case either of the corresponding flasks don't grow
per protocol on invitrogen kit
placed at 4c for 1.5 - 2.0 hours
Attempt to quantify using nanodrop reader.
Sample 1 contained 16.4 ng/ul
Sample 2 contained 18.4 ng/ul
Restriction Enzyme Digest
to use 25 ul of plasmid miniprep
we think it is bizarre that a plasmid that is supposed to be et resistant up to 150 ug/ml will not grow in culture at 10ug/ml of et. Since we are selecting this plasmid particularly for its et resistance for use in assembly we feel it would be best to discard this culture and pick another well from the item library perhaps 8A or 15 A. Decided not to proceed with enzyme digest.
