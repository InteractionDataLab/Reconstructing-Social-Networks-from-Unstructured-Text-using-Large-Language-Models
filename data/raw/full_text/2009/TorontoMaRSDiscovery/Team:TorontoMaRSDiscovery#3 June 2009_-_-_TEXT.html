Plasmid transformed = pSB1AC3 (TEST)
Note: team members were of mixed opinion as to whether the transform was likely due to low availability of DNA - DNA was split between a number of transformation reactions for at least 2 different DB3.1 strains. Plates incubated at 30 degrees Celsius overnight, temp. raised to 37 degrees approx. 10:30 a.m.
