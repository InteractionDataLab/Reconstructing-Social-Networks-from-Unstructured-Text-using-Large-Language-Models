September 29, 2009
took 400ul aliquots of the 4 samples for storage as stocks
Miniprepped the rest of the samples
Ran gel saw no colonies
Rechecked plates: lack of red colonies is suspicious
DH5 may be somewhat resistant to K (suggested by Calvin)
May need to gel extract backbone and parts before ligation
We are out of K plates; need to make more
