Digested plasmid samples miniprepped on Sat (1,2,4,K) and Enc, C plasmid with EcoR1 and Pst1
Ran a gel for the digests
(1+2) Sample 1 appeared to have a ~100bp band
K plasmid digest did not show the ccdb gene (~700bp) - will start another culture with antibiotics
Started overnight cultures of (1+2) Sample 1
