Ottawa
Ottawa is Canada’s capital and the  country’s fourth largest city with a population of approximately 865 000  people. It sits in eastern Ontario on the Ottawa River which divides the  provinces of Ontario and Quebec. This makes it one of the most bilingual cities  in Canada! Ottawa is not only Canada’s political center, but also a cultural  center as it boasts many museums, galleries and festivals. Ottawa is also home  to the Rideau Canal – the world’s longest skating rink!
