April
April 22 Broke off into different planning groups.
We split into three groups in order to focus and organize our planning stages. The groups are:

Business Planning Jeffrey Fischer, Roxanne Shank, Ashley Duncan, HJ Wieden
Research and Development Jeffrey Fischer, Lisza Bruder, Nathan Puhl, Fan Mo, Kirsten Rosler, Mackenzie Coatham, HJ Wieden
April 29 Starting to solidify our goals.
Fundraising group has come up with 4 levels of donations.
Research and Development have possibly found our model organism.
May 4th is our kickoff event with AIF.
We discussed setting up lab tutorials for those of us that are new team members, the dates and times TBD.

September 2nd
aGEM
judging criteria: wiki, poster and presentation
figures: gel showing over expression of proteins, one of the fluorescent proteins into a compartment, nanoparticle
VIPs: Tony Russel, Daniel Weeks
Parts registry page: keep the s codes separate, need code & info(detailed info to be added later), sequences?
Make a "Criteria met for judging page"
We need some canvassing done for fund raising
Synsystems as a business? Roxanne is looking into this
Modeling: everything is ready to go, making the U of A teams stuff priority
nanoparticle by end of the week?!
September 9th
We have 8 people going to the jamboree. Need to book flights and hotel.
Plan to come in on the Friday and leave on the Monday, which will do the least damage to class, lab and work schedules.
Alix is looking into samples for T-shirts for the jamboree, this needs to be done soon!
Poster (and presentation) for aGEM:
Figures: microcompartment with YFP and CFP inside, FRET diagram (Fan is doing both of these), nanoparticle diagram (Megan) and the biobattery (using Jeff's from the Dragon's Den, Ashley will send to Lisza)
September 16th
Lisza is getting knee surgery! Oh no!
So we need a different presenter for Saturday, Roxanne is picking it up as she is most familiar with inner workings of project.
Microcompartment update, interior of microcompartment is also negative.
Leaving for Banff, one car at 4:00 on Friday, one a little later.  We need to know what HJ wants.
Shirts were ordered today, navy blue.
Flights: out of calgary at 7AM, get into Boston at 5/6.  Changeover in Toronto. Flights back at 5:30 from Boston, and changeover in Montreal, arrive back in Calgary at 11.

Picking Local Potatoes
Picking potatoes was fun and a good workout.
This is the first step.  The tractor digs up the potatoes
Many potatoes we found were shaped like hearts!
I was surprised they allowed me on the tractor!
Here is one of the many big piles!
Later we put piles in buckets to be weighed.
Some delicious greenhouse tomatoes
