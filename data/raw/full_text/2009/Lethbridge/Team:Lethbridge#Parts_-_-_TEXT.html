BBa_K249002: Lumazine Synthase - Lumazine Synthase is an enzyme which creates Lumazine, a product which aggregates forming a hollow spheroid which can act as a mirocompartment, or artificial organelle. The Lumazine forms negatively charged pores, which can be used to introduce proteins. The proteins which are being introduced into the microcompartment must be equipped with an Arginine Tag. This is a protein coding part. Submitted.
BBa_K249004: N-terminal Arginine Fusion vector - pSB1A3 with an N-terminal Arginine tag. This particular plasmid utilizes the BioFusion (aka Silver Lab) Standard for BioBrick assembly at the suffix, and the regular BioBrick standard at the prefix. Adds 10 Arginine residues to the N-terminus of a Protein (includes Start Codon AUG).  This part is meant to work in conjunction with the Lumazine synthase microcompartment. Protein with the N-terminal Arginine fusion will be localized into the negative core of the Lumazine microcompartments. Submitted.
BBa_K249005: C-terminal Arginine fusion vector - pSB1A3 with a C-terminal Arginine tag. This particular plasmid utilizes the BioFusion (aka Silver Lab) Standard for BioBrick assembly at the prefix and the regular Biobrick standard at the suffix. Adds 10 Arginine residues to the C-terminus of a Protein (Includes Stop Codon)  this part is meant to work in conjunction with the Lumazine synthase microcompartment. Protein with the N-terminal Arginine fusion will be localized into the negative core of the Lumazine microcompartments. Submitted.
