Taken from an email received on September 21, 2009:
"As of now, the survey is closed and we will analyze the results. I am happy to say that also thanks to you we have achieved to collect 240 responses from all over the world. If you or your team mates are interested in the results or the general research you can visit our wiki. Also, feel free to contact me at any time via e-mail or ask questions in person at the Jamboree in Boston.
All the best with your research,
With grateful regards,
On behalf of the iGEM team TUDelft,
Tim Vos"
