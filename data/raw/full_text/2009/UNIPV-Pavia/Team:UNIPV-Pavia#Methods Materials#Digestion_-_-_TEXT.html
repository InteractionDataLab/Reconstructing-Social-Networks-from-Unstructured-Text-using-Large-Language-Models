BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
(estimated time: 3 hours)
To open vectors:
a volume containing 1 µg of purified plasmid
2 µl of buffer H
1 µl of first enzyme
1 µl of second enzyme
20 µl final volume
incubate at 37°C for 3 hours
To excide fragments:
20 µl of purified plasmid when <7 µg have been extracted. A volume containing 7 µg otherwise.
2.5 µl of buffer H
1 µl of first enzyme
1 µl of second enzyme
25 µl final volume
incubate at 37°C for 2 hours and 30 minutes
INGREDIENTS:
Roche restriction enzymes
Roche buffer H
Pre-warmed at 37°C bath
Cut and gel-extracted vector
ddH2O
