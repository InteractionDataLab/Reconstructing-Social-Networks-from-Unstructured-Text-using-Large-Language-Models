TECAN Infinite F200
TECAN Infinite F200
Tecan Infinite F200 is a multifunctional microplate filter-based reader with injector option, that provides high perfomarnce for the vast majority of microplate applications and research.  It has been designed as a general purpose laboratory instrument for professional use, supporting common 6 to 384-well microplates.
This instrument allows long incubation of the microplate, the chance to set the shaking movements, the duration of all operations, including cycles, and the dispensation of liquid material in the wells.  These actions are managed by a user interface operated by i-Control software, ranging from scheduling experiments to the cleaning of injectors.
We used this instrument for the following measurement techniques:
fluorescence intensity
Absorbance
