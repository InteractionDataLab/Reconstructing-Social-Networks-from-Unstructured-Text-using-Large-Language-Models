Week from August 31st, to September 6th, 2009

August, 31st
We inoculated:
10 colonies from B5new2 plate in 4 ml of LB + Kan for screening;
B8-5 (8 ul from glycerol stock) in 4 ml of LB + Kan (for purification process);
We sent A15-2 purified DNA (stored at -20°C) to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
Top
September, 1st
We received sequencing results for:
A16-4: sequence ok!
A14-3: sequence had a deletion in C0012, as we expected because of A11-2 sequencing results, previously received;
B8-5: sequence wrong in VF2 and good in VR;
A17: chromatogram was good, but ligation failed (R0011 was not in the insert).
COMMENTS after sequencing results:
now we have a new aTc sensor (A16) to test together with A9;
B8 has to be repeated or purified, we will try both the approaches;
A14 has to be repeated using A11-3, which has a consistent sequencing result;
A17 is going to be ligated today (this time using gel extraction).
Glycerol stocks for the 10 B5new2 grown cultures.
Miniprep for B5new2 (10 samples) and for B8-5.
Digestion for:
B5new2 (10 samples) for screening (E-P cut);
B8-5 for purification from gel (E-P cut);
R0011 (stored at -20°C) for A17new ligation (S-P cut)
E0240 (stored at -20°C) for A17new ligation (X-P cut)
Medium-size gel for B5new2(E-P); small-size gel for B8-5(E-P), R0011(S-P) and E0240(X-P).
File:Pv B5new2 digestion screening.jpg
Digestion screening for B5new2.
Medium gel results: B5new2 clones all showed the correct length for ligated plasmid! we decided to keep B5new2-3 to continue the assemblies and B5new2-9 as a backup copy. Both plasmids were sent to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
File:Pv B8 5 actual.jpg
B8-5 construct was actually a wrong plasmid: the 4Kbp fragment was non digested DNA. Sequencing results will tell us what there is inside the cloning site.
Small gel results: R0011(S-P) and E0240(X-P) were cut and purified through gel-extraction, while B8-5 could not be cut because the bands were not correct: maybe the heaviest band noticed on August 24th was a non-completely digested fragment, not a correct-size insert. We decided to throw B8-5 glycerol stock away.
Ligation: A17new = R0011(S-P) + E0240(X-P) in pSB1A2
We incubated ligation reaction at 16°C overnight.
We inoculated:
B5new2-3
B6-3
A4
F2620MIT1
A11-3
pH sensor
We streaked a single colony LB + Amp agar plate using (the right) K116002 glycerol stock. We incubated the plate at 37°C overnight.
Preparation of LBK (LB with potassium instead of sodium) at pH 5,5 - 6,6 - 7,5 - 8,5 for the first experiment we would have performed in the following days.

September, 2nd
Miniprep for:
B5new2-3
B6-3
A11-3
A4
F2620MIT1
E0240 pellet (stored at -20°C)
Digestions:
B5new2-3(E-X)
B6-3(E-X)
A11-3(S-P)
A4(E-S)
F2620MIT1(E-S)
E0240(X-P)
Gel run, cut and band purification for all the samples.
Ligations:
B7new = A4(E-S) + B5new2-3(E-X) in pSB1AK3
B8new = A4(E-S) + B6-3(E-X) in pSB1AK3
B9 = F2620MIT1(E-S) + B5new2-3(E-X) in pSB1AK3
B10 = F2620MIT1(E-S) + B6-3(E-X) in pSB1AK3
A14L = A11-3(S-P) + E0240(X-P) in pSB1A2
We incubated the five reactions at 16°C overnight.
Transformation/plating for A17new ligation.
pH sensor
We inoculated a single colony from K116002 streaked plate in 5 ml of LB + Amp.
Overnight incubation at 37°C, 220 rpm.

September, 3rd
A17new overnight plate showed only one colony...easy screening for this plate! Colony PCR/electrophoresis for this sample. We stored this colony in 100ul of LB + Amp and incubated it at 37°C waiting for the end of the reaction.
File:Pv pcr A17new.jpg
Colony PCR results for the only A17new colony on its plate.
Gel results: the blank was not so clean, but the only colony was positive:) We inoculated the colony in 5 ml of LB + Amp to grow an overnight culture (37°C, 220 rpm).
We transformed these ligations:
B7new 1:40 on Kan
B8new 1:40 on Kan
B9 1:40 on Kan
B10 1:40 on Kan
A14L 1:20 on Amp
We incubated B7new, B8new, B9 and B10 at 37°C in the morning. Then, five colonies for each plate were picked after about 11 hours. We inoculated these colonies in 5 ml of LB + Kan and incubated them overnight (37°C, 220 rpm). NOTE: B7new and B8new had smaller colonies than B9 and B10.
We incubated A14L plate overnight at 37°C.
pH sensor
Miniprep for K116002 overnight culture. We incubated the plate (LB + Amp) with transformed bacteria overnight at 37°C.
We used 1 ul of this sample to transform TOP10 in order to have the pH sensor in the same strain as the reference promoter (i.e. A2).
We plated transformed bacteria and incubated overnight at 37°C.
We also sent purified DNA to BMR Genomics for sequencing.

September, 4th
A14L plate showed colonies.
Colony PCR/electrophoresis for 6 colonies from A14L plate. Colonies were saved inoculating them in 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubating them at 37°C, 220 rpm waiting for the end of the reaction.
Gel results: all the colonies showed the amplicon with the right size, but even some extra band...we decided to stock all the colonies in glycerol. We also decided to keep A14L-1: we inoculated it in 5 ml of LB + Amp to grow an overnight culture to check the sequence.
We received sequencing results for B8-5again(VF2) and it was not correct.
Glycerol stock/miniprep for 21 cultures:
B7new X5 colonies
B8new X5 colonies
B9 X5 colonies
B10 X5 colonies
A17new
We sent A17new purified DNA to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
Screening (E-P digestion cut) for B7new, B8new, B9 and B10 samples.
pH sensor
K116002(TOP10) plate showed a bacterial carpet (with some single colony).
We inoculated a single colony from K116002 (TOP10) plate in 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubated this inoculum for about 6 hours (37°C, 220 rpm).
Glycerol stock.
