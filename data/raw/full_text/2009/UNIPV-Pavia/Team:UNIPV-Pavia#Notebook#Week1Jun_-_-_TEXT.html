Week from June 1st, to June 7th, 2009
Previous Week
Next Week
June, 3rd
We received lactose monohydrate, M9 minimal salts and Thiamine Hydrochloride from Sigma.
DNA resuspension from iGEM 2009 plates. We resuspended the two parts we needed to re-built the inconsistent BioBrick Q04400, the five commonly used RBSs and a 3OC6-HSL inducible measurement system for GFP test at Tecan F200:
B0030
B0031
P0440 (tetR protein generator)
B0032
B0033
T9002 (AHL-inducible GFP)
B0034
R0040 (Ptet)
Matteo and Lorenzo resuspending BioBricks from iGEM 2009 plates
Transformation of resuspended DNA (2 ul) in TOP10 E. coli, plated transformed bacteria and incubated the plates overnight at 37°C.
We streaked a plate with a 2008 glycerol stock containing E0240 under the control of a constitutive promoter (we call this construct "01") in order to use it in the fluorescence test at Tecan F200 on June 5th.

June, 4th
All the overnight plates showed colonies. 01 plate showed green fluorescence under UV rays, as we expected because GFP was expressed constitutively!
Unfortunately, B0034 and B0032 plates also showed a very small amount of unexpected red colonies...(@_@!?) These two parts had been resuspended from iGEM 2009 plate 1, just like Berkeley constitutive promoters, but it is not clear how they could be contaminated...
Anyway, we decided to continue our work and we picked one colony from the following plates:
B0030
B0031
P0440 (tetR protein generator)
B0032
B0033
T9002 (AHL-inducible GFP)
B0034
R0040 (Ptet)
01
J23100 (from +4°C plate)
J23101 (from +4°C plate)
J23118 (from +4°C plate)
and infected 1 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated the inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm for 5 and 1/2 hours. Of course, we carefully avoided to pick red colonies from B0034 and B0032 plates:) Sequencing checks will tell us if our parts are correct.
Glycerol stocks for all the grown cultures (except for 01, because we already had it).
NOTE: we re-picked colonies from J23100, J23101 and J23118 plates because data analysis of experiment 1 at Tecan F200 showed that J23101 promoter seemed stronger than J23100. This is not in accordance to the ranking of the promoters ( http://partsregistry.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson ), so we decided to repeat the test at Tecan F200 with brand new colonies and to store these new glycerol stocks at -80°C.
We prepared 5 ml cultures (re-filling the remaining 250 ul of the grown bacteria) for:
B0030-seq (for sequencing because it is the first RBS we wanted to use)
J23100-seq (for sequencing because we wanted to check the integrity of the downstream RFP)
J23100 (for tomorrow's test - RFP assay)
J23101 (for tomorrow's test - RFP assay)
J23118 (for tomorrow's test - RFP assay)
E0240 (for tomorrow's test - negative control, picked from the plate stored at +4°C)
T9002 (NOT INDUCED for tomorrow's test - GFP assay to detect leaky activity caused by Plux - we will call it T9002-)
T9002 (TO INDUCE TOMORROW for the test - GFP assay - we will call it T9002+)
01 (for tomorrow's test - positive control)
and incubated them overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.
Colony PCR for P0440(3 colonies) and R0040(3 colonies) plates to check for contaminations.
Gel run for the resulting reactions.
Susanna preparing samples for colony PCR
Colony PCR: P0040 insert was amplified correctly, while R0040 showed contaminants or unexpected bands
Gel results: the 3 colonies of P0440 all have the plasmid with the correct length of the insert (1078 bp), while there have been problems with R0040 colonies. R0040-1 and R0040-2 show the correct length of the insert (292 bp) with a high weight contaminant and R0040-3 show an unexpected wrong length. Next week we are going to digest P0440 and R0040 to perform their assembly, so we will check the actual plasmid and insert length again.

June, 5th
All the overnight cultures were grown. RFP-expressing cultures were red-coloured, as usual!
Miniprep for B0030-seq and J23100-seq.
We sent B0030 and J23100 to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
Preparation of the second experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:10 these overnight cultures:
J23100
J23101
J23118
E0240
T9002-
T9002+
01
We induced the diluted and non-diluted cultures of T9002+ with 3OC6-HSL 200 nM.
We incubated all the diluted and non-diluted cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm for 4 and 1/2 hours.
