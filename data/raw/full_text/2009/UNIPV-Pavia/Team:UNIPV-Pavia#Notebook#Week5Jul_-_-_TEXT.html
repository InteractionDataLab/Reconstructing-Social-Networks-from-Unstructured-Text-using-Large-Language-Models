Week from July 27th, to August 2nd, 2009

July, 27th
Screening for the 11 miniprepped DNA samples for B1: digestion S-P for all.
Insert here
Gel results:
Samples 1, 4, 10, 11, 14, 19 and 20 showed an extra band for the non ligated plasmid;
Samples 2, 9, 13 and 18 were pure! we decided to keep B1-13 (lane 8) to perform future ligations.
NOTE: we had a pure sample for B1 (i.e. B1-13)and three almost-pure sample for B2. Anyway, we decided to perform ligation reactions for these samples and the extra band of B2 will be eliminated during gel cut/purification. WE DECIDED TO KEEP B2-5. Next weeks we will think about purifying B2-5 itself.
We transformed 20 pg of B1-13 purified DNA (stored at -20°C) in TOP10 in order to prepare a glycerol stock for this construct. We incubated the plate at 37°C overnight.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of A14pg, A8pg and A9pg glycerol stocks.
We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with a single colony taken from B0030 native plate (stored at +4°C).
We incubated the inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.

July, 28th
We streaked LB agar plates + suitable antibiotic with iGEM stabs:
K116001
K116002
K112405
P0412
I746902
I746903
K101017
F2620MIT1
F2620MIT2
We incubated these "single colonies" plates at 37°C overnight.
We picked a single colony from B1-13 plate to infect 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubated this inoculum for 5 hours and 1/2.
We prepared a glycerol stock for B1-13.
We aliquoted the remaining 250 ul of B1-13 bacterial culture in two different falcon tubes and re-filled them with 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of B0015(X2) and B2-5(X2) glycerol stocks.
We incubated these six cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.
We received sequencing results for:
A12-2: sequence ok!
A12-3: sequence ok!
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:1000 the overnight cultures of A14pg, A8pg, A9pg and B0030.
We incubated the diluted cultures for 5 hours (37°C, 220 rpm).
After 5 hours, we adjusted the OD600 at 0.025.

July, 29th
Miniprep for:
B1-13
B1-13bis
B2-5
B2-5bis
B0015
B0015bis
Digestion:
B1-13(E-S)
B1-13bis(E-S)
B2-5(E-S)
B2-5bis(E-S)
B0015(E-X)
B0015bis(E-X) - 500ng
Gel run/cul/purification for:
B1-13(E-S) - ONLY FOR CHECK, NOT PURIFIED
B1-13bis(E-S) - ONLY FOR CHECK, NOT PURIFIED
B2-5(E-S)
B2-5bis(E-S)
B0015(E-X)
B0015bis(E-X)
Precipitation with sodium acetate for:
B1-13(E-S)
B1-13bis(E-S)
All the bands were in the right place!
We had good yields for all, except from B0015bis(E-X). We will use the other vector (i.e. B0015(E-X)) for ligation.
Ligation:
B3 = B1(E-S) + B0015(E-X) in pSB1AK3 (50 ng of vector)
B4 = B2(E-S) + B0015(E-X) in pSB1AK3 (26 ng of vector)
keeping the sample that gave the higher yield.
We incubated the ligations at 16°C overnight.
All the streaked plates showed single colonies! we prepared an inoculum for all of them picking a single colony and infecting 1 ml of LB + suitable antibiotic. We incubated these inocula for 5 hours and 1/2.
Then, we prepared a glycerol stock for each of them and re-filled the remaining 250 ul of bacterial culture with 3 ml of LB + suitable antibiotic.
We incubated the cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.

July, 30th
We transformed B3 (50 pg) and B4 (20 pg) ligations. We incubated the plates at 37°C overnight.
Miniprep for the overnight cultures of:
K116001
K116002
K112405
P0412
I746902
I746903
K101017
F2620MIT1
F2620MIT2
We sent purified DNA to BMR Genomics for sequencing (VF2 and VR for all of them, except from K112405, whose plasmid does not have VF2 annealing site).
We also sent purified DNA of B1-13 and B2-5 (stored at -20°C) to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
We received sequencing results for A11: lacI sequence showed a deletion...we will repeat A11 ligation from BOL1 and R0011 parts.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200 (for the following day!)
We inoculated 10 ul of J23100 and J23100-E0240 parts form UNIPV iGEM 2008 stocks.
We incubated these two inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.

July, 31st
B3 and B4 plates showed colonies! We picked 7 colonies for each plate and infected 1 ml of LB + Kan. We incubated these 14 inocula for 5 hours and 1/2. Then we prepared glycerol stocks and re-filled the remaining 250 ul of bacterial culture with 5 ml of LB + Kan.
We incubated these cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:100 J23100 and J23100-E0240 parts form UNIPV iGEM 2008 stocks overnight cultures.
We incubated these two cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm for about 3 hours.

August, 1st
Miniprep for the 7 colonies of B3 and for the 7 colonies of B4. We stored purified DNA at -20°C and next Monday we will perform screening for these 14 samples.
