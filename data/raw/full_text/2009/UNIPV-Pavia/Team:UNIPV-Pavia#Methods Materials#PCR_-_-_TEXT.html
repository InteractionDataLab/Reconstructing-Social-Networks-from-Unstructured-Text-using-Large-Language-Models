PCR
(estimated time: 3 hours and 30 min)
For every DNA sample you want to amplify, put:
2 µl buffer
0.6 µl MgCl2
0.4 µl dNTPs
1 µl DNA (or ddH2O for blank sample). If you are performing a colony PCR, pick up the desired colony from a plate with a tip and dip it in the solution.
0.2 µl Taq Polymerase
250 nM VF2 primer
250 nM VR primer
A proper amount of ddH2O to have 20 µl of total reaction volume
into an eppendorf tube.
Put the eppendorf tube in the thermal cycler and set this program:
95°C 10 min
CYCLE:
95°C 30 sec
60°C 1 min
72°C 1-3 min
for 35 cycles
72°C 7 min
16°C forever.
Now you can add a loading buffer to the solution and perform electrophoresis to check the amplified sequence length.
INGREDIENTS:
MgCl2
Buffer
dNTPs
ddH2O
Taq Polymerase
VF2 primer
