Electrophoresis
(estimated time: 2 hours)
Prepare agarose gel in 1x TBE buffer
Add ethidium bromide (using gloves and face mask for your safety):
1 µl in the small size agarose gel (70 ml)
2 µl in the middle size agarose gel (150 ml)
4 µl in the big size agarose gel (250 ml)
Cast the gel, insert the well-forming comb and let it polymerize
Add the loading buffer to each sample
Load the samples and 8 µl of marker
Set to 70-100 volts and electrophorese for the required amount of time
Use UV-light to look at the bands
Take a picture of the gel, if needed (not when bands have to be cut!!!)
INGREDIENTS:
DNA samples
Ethidium bromide
Loading buffer 10x Blue Juice, Invitrogen
TBE (Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer) 5x (final volume 1 liter)
54 gr Tris
27.5 gr Borate
20 ml EDTA 0.5 M (pH 8)
Marker (1 kb DNA Ladder, Promega)
Face mask and gloves
Electrophoresis apparatus
Transilluminator
NOTE: when not specified, the marker has the following pattern:
