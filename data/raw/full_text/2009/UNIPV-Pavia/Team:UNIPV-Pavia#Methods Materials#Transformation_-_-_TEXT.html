Transformation
(estimated time: 3 hours and 30 min + 12-16 hours overnight incubation)
Put 1-2 µl of DNA resuspension or ligation into thaw TOP10 cells tube (every tube contains approximately 60 µl of competent cells).
Incubate on ice for 30 min.
Heat shock: 42°C for 1 min.
Put transformed TOP10 tube on ice and then add 250 µl SOC medium.
Incubate 1 hour at 37°C, 220 rpm.
Plate 200 µl of the solution on a proper agar plate.
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
INGREDIENTS:
LB agar plates with proper antibiotic
Invitrogen TOP10 cells
Resuspended DNA
SOC medium
