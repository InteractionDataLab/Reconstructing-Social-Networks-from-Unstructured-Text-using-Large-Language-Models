Sensing ethanol concentration: our do-it-yourself kit
LB medium
(Estimated time: 10 min + 4 hours of autoclavation and cooling)
For a final volume of 1 l, put:
10 g NaCl
10 g BactoTryptone
5 g Yeast extract
15 g Agar (only for LB plates)
into 1 l of ddH2O.
Autoclave the solution.
Let it cool to ~40-45°C
Add the proper antibiotic if needed.
ONLY FOR PLATES:
Pour an homogenous layer of agar LB into Petri plates under the hood.
Let agar LB polymerase.
Cover and store at +4°C.
Always check for contaminations before using!
INGREDIENTS:
Clean bottle or flask
NaCl
BactoTryptone
Yeast extract
ddH2O
Agar
