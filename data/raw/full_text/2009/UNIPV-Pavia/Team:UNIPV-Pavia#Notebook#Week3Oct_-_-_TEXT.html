Week from October 12th, to October 18th, 2009

October, 12th
We repeated the digestion for F2620TOP10(S-P) and B5new2-3(X-P-ClaI).
Gel run/cut for the two plasmids: bands were good.
Gel extraction for:
F2620TOP10(S-P)
B5new2-3(X-P-ClaI)
B3(X-P)
B4(X-P)
A19-1(S-P)
Unfortunately we had a very low DNA yield for almost all of them: A19-1(S-P) and F2620(S-P) could not be used :'(
We decided not to repeat A19-1 extraction (and then the A21 re-cloning) and to assay our A21 construct for ethanol production.
F2620 DNA was over, so we inoculated 8 ul of F2620MIT1 glycerol stock in 7 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated this inoculum overnight (37°C, 220 rpm).
We inoculated 12 of our assemblies in 3 ml of LB + Amp in order to prepare the DNA to send to iGEM HQ:
A1
A2
A3
A4
A5
A6
A7
A8pg
A9pg
A11-3
A12-2
A15-3
We ordered a gas chromatography for a sample of the supernatants (taken the previous day).

October, 13th
Miniprep for the 12 inocula to be sent.
Miniprep, cut S-P, gel run/cut/purification for F2620MIT1. This time we had a good yield;)
Ligations:
B14 = F2620(S-P) + B3(X-P) in pSB1A2
B15 = F2620(S-P) + B4(X-P) in pSB1A2
We incubated them at 16°C overnight.
Top
October, 14th
We transformed the two ligations (after 1:20 dilution) and incubated the plated bacteria overnight (37°C).
We inoculated all the remaining assemblies (12) in order to send purified DNA to iGEM HQ (3 ml of LB + Amp).
We inoculated 8 ul of B5new2-3, F2620TOP10 and B0015 glycerol stocks in 8 ml of LB + Amp + 2% glucose. We incubated them at 37°C, 220 rpm in the morning.
Team meeting

October, 15th
We diluted 25 ul of A14S-3 in 3 ml of LB + Amp and in 3 ml of LB + Amp + 1mM IPTG. We incubated the two cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm for 6 hours. Then we measured OD600 and fluorescence, but unfortunately their GFP levels were the same.
Miniprep for the remaining BioBricks.
pH measurement for B5new2-3, F2620TOP10 and B0015 24 hour cultures. We diluted 1:100 these three cultures in LB + Amp + 10% glucose and aliquoted them in the microplate reader (anaerobic).
We inoculated 4 colonies of B14 plate and 3 colonies of B15 plate in 5 ml of LB + Amp and incubated them at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight. Tomorrow they will be screened!
We received gas chromatography results.
