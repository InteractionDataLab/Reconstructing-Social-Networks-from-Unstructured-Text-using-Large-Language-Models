Week from August 17th, to August 23rd, 2009
Previous Week
Next Week
August, 17th
This week we planned to perform a gel run for all the constructs of the ethanol producing operon in order to check for contaminant bands. Then, we planned to ligate a promoter upstream of the ethanol producing operon and to build up measurement systems for A11 (lactose sensor) and A12 (aTc sensor).
We inoculated 8 ul of:
B1-13
B2-5
B3-5
B4-2
B5-3
B6-3
E0240
A11-2
glycerol stocks in 5 ml of LB + suitable antibiotic.
We incubated these cultures overnight (37°C, 220 rpm).
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We dissolved 22 mg of lactose in 5 ml of LB + Kan in order to have 4.5% lactose.
We prepared lactose assay kit for testing.

B2-5
B3-5
B4-2
B5-3
B6-3
E0240
A11-2
Digestion with EcoRI for:
B1-13
B2-5
B3-5
B4-2
B5-3
B6-3
Digestion with EcoRI-PstI for:
B1-13

B5-3
B6-3
Digestion with PstI for:
B1-13
B2-5
B3-5
B4-2

B6-3
Electrophoresis for the digested plasmids.
Digestion check on fermentation parts (1st gel).
Digestion check on fermentation parts (2nd gel).
Gel results:
B1 - ok
B2 - ok
B3 - two extra-bands (consistent with previous gels)
B4 - ok
B5 - two extra bands (consistent with previous gels)
B6 - two extra bands (consistent with previous gels)
We decided to try to ligate a promoter upstream of B5 and B6 anyway.
We inoculated 8 ul of:
A4(X2)
A12
glycerol stocks.
We incubated these inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.

A12
Digestion for:
A4(E-S)(X2)
A12(S-P)
Precipitation with sodium acetate for:
A11-2(S-P)
B5(E-X)
B6(E-X)
A4(E-S)(X2)
A12(S-P)
Gel run/cut/purification for E0240.
Ligations:
B7 = A4(E-S) + B5(E-X) in pSB1AK3
B8 = A4(E-S) + B6(E-X) in pSB1AK3
A14 = A11(S-P) + E0240(X-P) in pSB1A2
A16 = A12(S-P) + E0240(X-P) in pSB1A2

August, 20th
We resuspended pSB3K3 from 2009 Registry Distribution. The plasmid with ccdB was not consistent, so we resuspended a consistent brick (of ~700bp length, suggested in the Registry "Help" page: Kit Plate 2, well 15L, I714891 brick) contained in pSB3K3.
We transformed the overnight ligations and I714891 in TOP10 and plated transformed bacteria on LB agar plates + Amp (A14 and A16) or + Kan (pSB3K3, B7 and B8). We incubated the plates at 37°C overnight.
We sent these samples (stored at -20°C) to BMR Genomics for sequencing:
A15-1
A15-3
A11-2
A11-3
B5-3
B6-3
B3-5 (again, because we wanted to check for contaminants in our native stock)

August, 21st
Colony PCR for A14 (5 colonies) and A16 (5 colonies) plates. Colonies were inoculated in 1 ml of LB + Amp and let grow waiting for the end of the reaction.
Electrophoresis for PCR results.
Gel results (picture not taken, sorry...):
A14 - 3rd colony seems the most pure and it had the expected length for ligated plasmid.
A16 - reaction worked only on A16-1, but it was negative.
We decided to keep A14-3 (positive at PCR) and A16-4 (randomly chosen) for digestion screening: we prepared a glycerol stock for them and re-filled the remaining 250 ul of bacteria with 4 ml of LB + Amp.
We incubated these cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.
We picked 2 colonies from B7, 5 colonies from B8 and 1 colony from I714891 plates. We inoculated them in 1 ml of LB + Kan and incubated them at 37°C, 220 rpm for 5 hours and 1/2. Then we prepared glycerol stocks and re-filled the remaining 250 ul with 4 ml of LB + Kan.
NOTE: we decided not to perform PCR on B7 and B8 plates because of the large size of positive inserts.
We incubated the re-filled cultures at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.
