Week from June 22nd, to June 28th, 2009
Previous Week
Next Week
June, 22nd
This week we planned to ligate the GFP protein generator under the control of Ptet in A4 and A6 constructs, in order to have:
an aTc->GFP measurement system (A6-E0240 = J23100-RBS-tetR-TT-Ptet-RBS-GFP-TT) and
a control construct that should always express GFP(A4-E0240 = RBS-tetR-TT-Ptet-RBS-GFP-TT)
Moreover, we planned to begin the construction of a lysis actuator with K117000 (=celB) BioBrick and also a test construct with J23118 to assay GFP expression.
We infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of these glycerol stocks (to prepare samples for this week's ligations):
K117000
E0240 (X5)
J23118
A4
A6
B0015
We incubated the 5 ml cultures overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.
We transformed BOL1 plasmid in TOP10 and plated transformed bacteria in a LB + Amp agar plate. We incubated the plate overnight at 37°C.
Wiki updating.
We ordered pdc and adhB coding sequences from Zymomonas mobilis to Mr Gene. They had the following specifications:
the sequences were taken from the online data banks, considering the most recent entries;
the organism of interest was Z. mobilis CP4 (ATCC 31821);
the sequences were codon-optimized for E. coli;
prefix and suffix sequences were added, considering that both genes start with ATG;
an additional stop codon (TAA) was addad at the end of the coding sequence, just before the suffix, in order to have a double stop codon;
restriction sites EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI and NotI had to be avoided during codon optimization (while the original coding sequences didn't have any of them).

June, 23rd
BOL1 plate showed colonies! We picked a colony from BOL1 plate and infected 1 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated the inoculum at 37°C, 220 rpm for 5 and 1/2 hours.
Glycerol stock for the grown culture of BOL1.
We re-filled the remaining 250 ul of BOL1 culture with 5 ml of LB + Amp and incubated the culture overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm. The next day it will be miniprepped and sent to BMR for sequencing!
Miniprep for: E0240 (5 samples), A4, A6, B0015, J23118 and K117000
Digestions:
E0240(X-P) (5 samples)
J23101(E-S)
K117000(E-S)
A4(S-P)
A6(S-P)
B0015(E-X)
The bands were cut from the gel and the following ligations were performed:
A7 = J23118(S-P) + E0240(X-P)
A8 = A4(S-P) + E0240(X-P)
A9 = A6(S-P) + E0240(X-P)
A10 = K117000(E-S) + TT(E-X)
The ligation reactions were incubated overnight at 16°C.
Elisa and Letizia working on our wiki.
June, 24th
Miniprep for BOL1. We also sent the purified plasmid to BMR Genomics for sequencing.
We resuspended R0011 (=Plac) and K112808 (=lysis actuator from T4 phage) from the iGEM plates with 15 ul of RNAse free water.
Trasformations in TOP10 bacteria were done for: A7, A8, A9, A10, K112808 and R0011. We plated the transformed bacteria and incubated the plates overnight at 37°C.
Team meeting
We received sequencing results for:
K131009 - MIT sequencing was confirmed: celB had a point mutation which changes 1 amino acid L->M, while both prefix and suffix had a nucleotide deletion (anyway, the restriction sites were not corrupted). We will document it on K131009 page, but by now we don't know if it is a good idea to use this BioBrick...
A3 - correct! (long part, but lacZ had already been successfully tested)
A4 - correct!
A5? - correct! (long part, but lacZ had already been successfully tested), we were very lucky: the colony had been chosen randomly from the A5 plate:):) Now "A5?" will be called "A5"!
A6 - correct!
June, 25th
All the overnight plates showed colonies!
We picked a colony from R0011 and K112808 plates to infect 1 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated the two inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm for 5 and 1/2 hours.
Glycerol stocks for R0011 and K112808. The remaining 250 ul of R0011 grown culture had been re-filled with 5 ml of LB + Amp to grow an overnight culture (37°C, 220 rpm).
We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of BOL1 glycerol stock to grow an overnight culture (37°C, 220 rpm).
Colony PCR for:
A7 - 3 colonies (few colonies because we picked non red coloured colonies)
A8 - 8 colonies (important ligation!)
A9 - 12 colonies (important ligation!)
A10 - 3 colonies (it's quite unuseful to screen this ligation, because probably we are not able to discriminate the positive and the negative transformants)
The picked colonies used in the PCR were inoculated in 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubated at 37°C, 220 rpm, waiting for the gel results.
We performed two different PCR programs:
one for A7 (expected size of positive plasmid: ~1 Kb) and A10 (expected size of positive plasmid: ~600 bp), with 3 min elongation time
and a different one for A8 and A9 (expected size of positive plasmids: ~2 Kb for both).
Electrophoresis for the resulting reactions.
Colony PCR on A7, A8, A9, A10: we chose the 1st screened colony for A7 (A7-1), while we did not choose any colony for the other ligations because they did not look correct.
Gel results:
A7 - all colonies were good, we kept A7-1 to store a glycerol stock.
A8, A9 and A10 unfortunately showed extra bands. So, we didn't keep any colony for them.
Blank reaction also showed a contaminant band.
We planned:
not to care about A10 at the moment because the priority was to test aTc sensing device with A8 and A9;
to re-examinate the gel results to explain the lengths of the extra bands (on Monday);
to re-transform the ligations (stored at -20°C) because probably more than one plasmid had been incorporated in the screened colonies...
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of:
T9002 (the following day it will be diluted and induced with different concentrations of 3OC6-HSL)
E0240 (negative control)
A1 (positive control)
glycerol stocks. We incubated the inocula overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.

Susanna resuspending pellets during miniprep.
Miniprep for R0011 and BOL1. The purified plasmids were stored at -20°C ready to be cut!
We diluted 1:20 the A8 and A9 ligations, which were stored at -20°C, and transformed 1 ul of the dilution in TOP10 E. coli. We plated the transformed bacteria on LB + Amp agar plates and incubated the two plates at 37°C overnight.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:1000 the overnight cultures of:
T9002 (24 different 5 ml cultures)
E0240 (one 5 ml culture)
A1 (one 5 ml culture)
We induced the 24 cultures of T9002 with eigth different concentrations of 3OC6-HSL (three 5 ml cultures for each concentration): 0 nM, 0.1 nM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 uM, 10 uM, 100 uM.
We incubated the cultures overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm for 3 hours.

June, 27th
The two overnight plates showed colonies. We put the two grown plates at +4°C: next week they will be screened!
