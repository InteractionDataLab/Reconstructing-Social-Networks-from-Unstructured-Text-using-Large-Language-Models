Week from July 6th, to July 12nd, 2009
Previous Week
Next Week
July, 6th
We planned to dedicate this week to the assembly of an IPTG/lactose->PoPS device in order to have a lactose sensor for our project, but also a useful inducible system for general purpose applications.
We already had R0011 and BOL1 purified plasmids stored at -20°C. Digestion for:
R0011(E-X)
BOL1(E-S)
Gel run/cut and band purification.
The purified DNA gave a good result at Nanodrop, but we decided to perform the entire work on BOL1 again because we were not sure that we had extracted a pure band.
We stored R0011(E-X) DNA at -20°C.
We infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 8 ul of BOL1 glycerol stock to grow two identical overnight cultures (37°C, 220 rpm).
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We picked a colony of B0030 plate (stored at +4°C) and infected 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 10 ul of A1 and J23100 glycerol stocks.
We incubated the inocula overnight at 37°C, 220 rpm.

July, 7th
Miniprep for BOL1 (X2).
Digestion for BOL1(E-S)(X2).
Gel run/cut/purification: none of the two BOL1 samples gave a good results in DNA quantification...we decided to cut the miniprepped plasmids again, but this time through an overnight digestion (both plasmids E-S).
In case of failure, we also infected 5 ml of LB + Amp with 8 ul of BOL1 glycerol stock to grow an overnight culture at 37°C, 220 rpm.
We prepared 0.5 l of LB + Amp.
We received sequencing results for:
T9002 - long part, but SEQUENCE CONFIRMED! while MIT results were "INCONSISTENT".
A10 - results showed a good chromatogram, but K117000 had not been correctly ligated. We will repeat this ligation one of the next weeks.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:100 the overnight cultures of A1, B0030 and J23100.
We incubated the diluted cultures for 5 hours (37°C, 220 rpm).
Experiment with Tecan F200
Download Protocol
Preparation of tomorrow's experiment with Tecan F200
We picked a colony from B0030 native plate (stored ad +4°C) and infected 5 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated the inoculum at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight.

July, 8th
Gel run/cut/band purification for BOL1(E-S) overnight digestion. Results: gel showed that the enzymes had cut very well and this time also the purification gave a good quantification at Nanodrop.
We took R0011(E-X) stored ad -20°C and we were ready to ligate;)
Ligation:
A11: BOL1(E-S) + R0011(E-X) in pSB1A2
We incubated the ligation overnight at 16°C.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:100 the overnight culture of B0030.

July, 9th
We resuspended F2620 BioBrick from iGEM 2009 plates.
We transformed about 40 pg of the overnight ligation and 1 ul of the resuspended F2620 BioBrick. We plated transformed bacteria and incubated the two plates overnight at 37°C.

July, 10th
A11 and F2620 overnight plates showed colonies!
Colony PCR for 6 colonies of A11 plate: the picked colonies were inoculated in 1 ml of LB + Amp and incubated at 37°C, 220 rpm waiting for PCR results.
We also picked a colony from F2620 to infect 1 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated this inoculum with the others.
Colony PCR for A11 plate: all the colonies showed the correct plasmid. We kept the 1st, 3rd and 6th colonies.
Gel results: all the picked colonies showed the expected amplicon of a correctly ligated plasmid! We decided to prepare a glycerol stock for:
A11-1
A11-3
A11-6
Next week, only A11-1 will be used, but the other colonies will be used in case of failure.
We also prepared a glycerol stock for F2620 culture.
We contacted iGEM HQ to request these BioBricks:
K116001
K116002
K112405
P0412
I746902
I746903
K101017
F2620
