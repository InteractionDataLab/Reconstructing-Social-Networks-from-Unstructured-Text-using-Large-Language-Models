SequenceAlignment
We developed this tool to speed up the quality control of the assembled BioBricks.  It’s a Matlab graphics interface that allows you to align the results of the sequencing procedures with expected sequences, built up assembling simple parts (BioBricks) according to the rules of Standard Assembly (modality of use Compare Sequence/BioBrick). It offers also the possibility of simply align two sequences (modality of use Compare two Sequences).
SequenceAlignment executable files for Windows platforms and the relative User's Guide can be downloaded free of charge for non-profit institutions from the following web site: Download SequenceAlignment .
