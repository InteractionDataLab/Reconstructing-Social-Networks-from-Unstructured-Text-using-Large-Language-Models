Hello, iGEM! I’m Giulio, a 23-year-old biologist/biotechnologist.  I come from Pavia, where I’ve always been studying until now, and where I live, but I have in program to continue my studies abroad. In my free time I enjoy reading, writing short stories - and novels, too - and playing electric guitar. Travel is another of my passions and take a plane whenever possible!
The iGEM experience thrills me very much, for I’ve always been fond of crossover approach to issues (that’s why I chose Biotechnology as Bachelor Degree) and applying molecular biology in some more analytic and quantitative ways is definitely uncommon as well as exciting. What’s more, it is a chance for having contact with people with different personal formation, and culture, too!

Hi guys! My name is Elisa, I’m 22 and I come from a small town in the North-Est of Italy.
I’ve been fascinated by the iGEM experience since the first time I got in contact with it, looking at the previous UNIPV-team’s wiki.
I think it’s a unique opportunity for us, engineering students, to experience laboratory-life, learn a lot of new things and meet other people, different in approaching the problems, and so interesting!
It offers also another important chance: the opportunity to have OUR project, and see it growing up from the idea to the end. And this is very motivating for me!
About me…I like travelling, photographing and going out with friends! Don’t mind sports (skiing, running, playing football) and reading as well.

Hi! I'm Rita and I'm 21 years old. I come from Alberobello, a small town in southern Italy and UNESCO World Heritage. I moved to Pavia to pursue my studies and I attend the third year of biomedical engineering. My participation in the iGEM competition is motivated by the fact that I think it is an experience that allows us to enrich our theoretical and practical knowledge due to heterogeneity of the topics that are addressed. In my free time I like to read and relax with my friends.

Hello iGEM! My name is Andrea, I’m 23 and I come from a tiny enchanted town in the middle of the countryside.
I'm looking forward to joining iGEM meeting in Boston since I'm very interested in such projects that ask you to melt knowledge, to learn from your mates and to work as a team :)
If you want to know my hobbies, I'm fond of scouting , playing several sports and... beer brewing (have a taste of Beeromeo!).

Master Student in Molecular Biology, Università degli Studi di Pavia

Hi there! I'm a Biotechnology/Molecular Biology student here in Pavia, but i was born in Piacenza, a nice city along the Po River. I was interested in synthetic biology since my freshman year here in Pavia, and now the iGEM competition allows me to deal with the subject directly on the bench and to observe biological problems from an engineeristic point of view.
My hobbies are books, watching and playing every sport known to men and movies (David Lynch's fan please stand up!)

In September 2007 I took my  Bachelor Degree in Biomedical Engineering and now I'm Master Student in Biomedical Engineering. Where? But always here, at Università degli Studi di Pavia!
Personal
Hi everybody, I'm Giacomo, 24 years old, and live in Montebello della Battaglia (Don't you remember it? Then go here and here ), a small village near Pavia.
I immediately interested in iGEM because it's a true opportunity to implement our different skills and learn from other scientific fields.
I like sports, movies and so on...
What else?
See you at the competition.

Paolo Magni
Academic
I am a Professor of Bioengineering. My teaching and research interests ranging from mathematical model of biological systems to bioinformatics and synthetic biology, from statistics and probability models to medical informatics.
Personal
I am 40 years old. I am the promoter of the iGEM competition in Pavia. I am an enthusiastic fan of this competition! I think that it represents a big opportunity for a student. I have selected our best students from Biology, Biotechnology and Bioengineering programs and I tried to build a team. Even if I have spent a lot of time in this initiative, I am very happy to partecipate to iGEM 2009 and to have worked with all of them. All members of the team are fantastic! Thanks!
For 20 years, I was a national referee of Handball. I like skiing and ... teaching to those students that want to learn :-)

What we did
Giulio Chiesa worked on: the final steps of ethanol-producing operon assembly (August-September), medium design (M9 supplemented, LB supplemented and fermentation broth), and the design of all the fermentation tests. He also worked on potassium dichromate measurement system and he is now working on the presentation.
Elisa Del Fabbro performed the complete experimental setup of the microplate reader. She also worked on experimental data analysis and the related Matlab tools, SequenceAlignment software development and sponsor searching. Responsible of sequencing results analysis and wiki design coordinator.
Rita De Molfetta worked on wiki periodic updating (August-September-October) and helped the team in experiment design (promoters section), growth curves protocol optimization and in some routinary wetlab activities (July). She introduced biologists to the basic concepts of Matlab.
Letizia Diamante worked on DNA resuspension and long term stocks storing for all the BioBrick parts used from 2009 DNA Distribution (May-June). She performed the first cloning steps of the project (beta-gal generator and constitutive promoters measurement systems). She also worked on wiki design.
Manuel Lupotto cloned the IPTG and aTc sensors and the lysis inducible actuator. He also performed biochemical studies in literature about ethanol fermentation and quantitative predictions about theoretical yield from cheese whey fermentation. He performed the tests of the lysis actuator.
Matteo Meroso worked on pH sensor (literature study, DNA cloning and tests with the microplate reader). Registry update with UNIPV-Pavia 2009 team parts.
Susanna Schiavi worked on cloning and debugging of the regulated ethanol-producing operon. She performed all fermentation experiments. She also prepared all the competent cells and managed gas chromatography samples and results. Finally, she prepared the BioBrick parts to send to the Registry.
Andrea Turcato proposed the project and worked on literature about cheese whey. He is now working on poster design.
Valerio Vitelli performed the initial steps of ethanol-producing operon assembly (July-August). He proposed the potassium dichromate methodology and he also worked on ethanol production debugging. At the beginning of iGEM, he performed all the Genomic databank searches for pdc and adhB coding sequences.
Giacomo Zambianchi worked on pH sensor (medium and test design, tests with the microplate reader). He designed the team logos, T-shirts and gadgets. He contributes to the Wiki design and implementation.
Susanna Zucca performed all the promoter characterizations with the microplate reader and protocol optimization. She contributes to the Wiki implementation. Poster and presentation coordinator.
Lorenzo Pasotti trained and supervised the team about both drylab and wetlab activities. Instructor for the rest of the team about physical and functional standardization in Synthetic Biology. Registry, wiki, poster and presentation supervisor (with Paolo Magni). He also participated (with Paolo Magni) to all the discussions about project problems and issues.
Daniela Galli helped the rest of the team in solving microbiological problems, debugging and protocols for the wetlab.
Gabriella Cusella is the leader of the wetlab in which the students worked during the summer. She organized the spaces, the instruments and the lab funds dedicated to the iGEM project.
Paolo Magni coordinated all the project activities: meetings, project timeline, fundraising, contacts with media and institutions. Registry, wiki, poster and presentation supervisor (with Lorenzo Pasotti). He also performed the selection of the team students and he participated (with Lorenzo Pasotti) to all the discussions about project problems and issues.
All team members contributed equally to brainstorming sessions, BioBrick parts selection and project documentation.
