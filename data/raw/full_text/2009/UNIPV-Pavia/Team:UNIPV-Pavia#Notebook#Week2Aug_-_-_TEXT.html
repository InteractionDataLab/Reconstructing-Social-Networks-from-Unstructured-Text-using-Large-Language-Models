Week from August 10th, to August 16th, 2009
Previous Week
Next Week
August, 10th
Digestion for:
B1-13(E-S)(X2)
B2-5(E-S)(X2)
B3-5(E-X)(X2)
B4-2(E-X)(X2)
Gel run for all of them (only 1 ul for B1-13(E-S)(X2) in order to check the length)
Gel run for B1, B2, B3 and B4.
We saw a couple of spurious bands in B3...but we ignored them and cut the single band with expected length.
Band cut/purification for:
B2-5(E-S)(X2)
B3-5(E-X)(X2)
B4-2(E-X)(X2)
Ethanol precipitation with sodium acetate for B1-13(E-S)(X2).
Ligation:
B5 = B1(E-S) + B4(E-X) in pSB1AK3
B6 = B2(E-S) + B3(E-X) in pSB1AK3
We incubated the ligation reactions at 16°C overnight.
Top
August, 11th
We transformed the overnight ligations of B5 and B6 (20 pg). We plated the transformed bacteria on LB agar plates + Kan and incubated the plates at 37°C overnight.
Digestion for:
BOL1(E-S)
R0010(E-X)
F2620MIT1(E-S)
K112808(E-X)
Gel run/cut/purification for all of them. All the bands were present at the right size!
Ligation (20 ul final volume) for:
A11 = BOL1(E-S) + R0011(E-X) in pSB1A2 (we call it A11 again, because the previous A11 had a deletion ad we threw it away)
A15 = F2620MIT1(E-S) + K112808(E-X) in pSB1A2
We incubated the ligations at 16°C overnight.
M9 supplemented medium preparation (with glycerol). This first attempt showed precipitations...we will try tomorrow to dissolve MgSO4 and CaCl2 in ddH2O very slowly.
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We inoculated 10 ul of A2 glycerol stock and a single colony of B0033 from its native plate in 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We incubated the cultures overnight (37°C, 220 rpm).
Top
August, 12th
We transformed 1 ul of A11 and A15 ligations in TOP10. We plated on LB + Amp agar plates and incubated them in the morning.
After about 9 hours the plates showed many colonies! we picked three single colonies from each plate and infected 5 ml of LB + Amp. We incubated these inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm overnight to grow up cultures to screen.
We picked 7 colonies from B5 and B6 overnight plates and infected 1 ml of LB + Kan. We incubated these 14 inocula at 37°C, 220 rpm for 6 hours and then we prepared glycerol stocks.
We re-filled the remaining 250 ul with 5 ml of LB + Kan to grow overnight cultures to screen.
We repeated M9 supplemented medium preparation and we finally had it without precipitations!
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:100 the overnight cultures of A2 and B0033.
We incubated the diluted cultures for 5 hours (37°C, 220 rpm).
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200 (for the following day!)
We inoculated 10 ul of A2 glycerol stock in 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We incubated the culture overnight (37°C, 220 rpm).
Top
August, 13th
Glycerol stocks for:
A11 (3 samples)
A15 (3 samples)
Miniprep for:
B5 (7 samples)
B6 (7 samples)
A11 (3 samples)
A15 (3 samples)
Digestion screening for all the samples:
B5(E-P)
B6(E-P)
A11(S-P)
A15(E-P)
Medium-size gel for B5 and B6; small-size gel for A11 and A15.
Screening digestion for B5 and B6 (both cut E-P).
Screening digestion for A11 (S-P) and A15 (E-P).
Gel results:
B5 - the first colony was surely wrong, while the others showed the right size for ligated plasmid, but also two smaller unexpected bands...
B6 - all the colonies showed the right size for ligated plasmid, but also two smaller unexpected bands...
A11 - the first colony was a false positive, while A11-2 and A11-3 showed the expected length for ligated plasmid.
A15 - all the 3 samples had the expected length for a correct insert and vector.
We will repeat the screening for B5 and B6 changing the enzymes to understand something more.
Overnight digestion for the 14 miniprepped samples of B5 and B6 (HindIII-EcoRI).
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200 (for tomorrow!)
We inoculated 10 ul of A11-2, A11-3, A15-1, A15-2 and A15-3 in 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We incubated the inocula overnight (37°C, 220 rpm).
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:100 the overnight culture of A2.
We incubated the diluted culture for 5 hours (37°C, 220 rpm).
Top
August, 14th
Miniprep for:
A11-2
A11-3 - low yield, to do again.
A15-1
A15-2 - low yield, to do again.
A15-3
Electrophoresis for the overnight digestion (B5 and B6 cut HindIII-EcoRI).
Debugging digestion for B5 and B6 (HindIII-EcoRI).
Gel results: all the samples showed the expected bands for ligated plasmids, but also MANY other unwanted bands...
Preparation of experiment with Tecan F200
We diluted 1:100 the overnight cultures of A11-2, A11-3, A15-1, A15-2 and A15-3 in 5 ml of LB + Amp.
We incubated these dilutions for 5 hours (37°C, 220 rpm).
