DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
(estimated time: 1 hour)
Add 1/10 DNA solution volume of sodium acetate 3 M
Add 2.5 DNA solution volume of absolute ethanol
Freeze at -80°C for 30 min
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm, 4°C for 20 min
Decant supernatant
Add 50 µl of 70% ethanol
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm, 4°C for 20 min
Remove all supernatant with a pipette
Air dry pellet until ethanol is totally removed
Elute with 5-10 µl of ddH2O
INGREDIENTS:
Sodium acetate
Absolute ethanol
Ethanol 70%
ddH2O
DNA sample
