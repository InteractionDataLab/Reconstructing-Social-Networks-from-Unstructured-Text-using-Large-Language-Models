</P><P>In the case of multiple growth curves for a strain, the mean value of the processed curves was computed for each time sample before applying the above described procedure.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Relative_Promoter_Units_.28RPUs.29">Relative Promoter Units (RPUs)</SPAN></H3><P>The RPUs are standard units proposed by <A href="/Team:UNIPV-Pavia/Project/References#18" title="Team:UNIPV-Pavia/Project/References"> Kelly J. et al., 2008</A>, in which the transcriptional strength of a promoter can be measured using a reference standard, just like the ground in electric circuits.
</P><P>RPUs have been computed as:
</P><P>in which:
</P><UL><LI>phi is the considered promoter and J23101 is the reference standard promoter (taken from Anderson Promoter Collection);
</LI><LI>F is the blanked fluorescence of the culture, computed subtracting for each time sample fluorescence measure for negative control from that of culture, where the negative control is a non-fluorescent strain (in our experiment it is usually used TOP10 strain bearing  or , which are symmply RBSs do not have expression systems for reporter genes);
</LI><LI>ABS is the blanked absorbance (O.D.600) of the culture, computed as described in &quot;Growth curves&quot; section.
</LI></UL><P>RPU measurement has the following advantages (under suitable conditions)
</P><UL><LI>it is proportional to PoPS (Polymerase Per Second), a very important parameter that expresses the transcription rate of a promoter;
</LI><LI>it uses a reference standard and so measurements can be compared between different laboratories.
</LI></UL><P>The hypotheses on which RPU theory is based can be found in <A href="/Team:UNIPV-Pavia/Project/References#18" title="Team:UNIPV-Pavia/Project/References"> Kelly J. et al., 2008</A>, as well as all the mathematical steps. From our point of view, the main hypotheses that have to be satisfied are the following:
</P><UL><LI>the reporter protein must have a half life higher than the experiment duration (we use GFPmut3, , which has an estimated half life of at least 24 hours, and the experiments duration is always less than 7 hours);
</LI><LI>strain, plasmid copy number, antibiotic, growth medium, growth conditions, protein generator assembled downstream of the promoter must be the same in the promoter of interest and in J23101 reference standard.
</LI><LI>steady state must be valid, so (dF/dt)/ABS (proportional to the GFP synthesis rate per cell) must be constant.
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Inducible_systems">Inducible systems</SPAN></H2><P>Every experiment is performed on the following cultures:
</P><UL><LI>the culture of interest (system studied expressing GFP)
</LI><LI>the benchmarck used to evaluate R.P.U. ( measurement part, that is  with  downstream)
</LI><LI>a negative control (generally,  RBS)
</LI></UL><P>For inducible systems several plots are reported. The first plot is a panel containing 4 subplots, numerated this way:
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD>(1)
</TD><TD>(2)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>(3)
</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Plot (1) contains growth curves of the cultures, after blank value has been removed. Every curve is calculated averaging on three replicates of the same culture and subtracting the blank for each time sample. Blank is calculated averaging the replicates of blank wells. 
</P><P>Plot (2) shows the logarithm of absorbance in exponential phase of bacterial growth, determined by a visual inspection of log-plots. These values are used to evaluate doubling time and R.P.U..
</P><P>Plot (3) contains (dGFP/dt)/O.D., the value named S_cell in Kelly J. et al., 2008 procedure for RPU evaluation. 
</P><P>In these plots are reported black veritcal lines that define the range of values used to evaluate RPU. It is important to underline, as explained in next paragraph, that RPU are calculated on cultures at the same O.D. level, not at the same time.
</P><P>The second graphic shows S_cell VS O.D.. This plot allows the conparison of S_cell values between different cultures, that are supposed to reach the same level of growth not at the same time, but at the same O.D. value. 
</P><P>The third graphic shows the induction curve. The RPU value is calculated on S_cell values corresponding to O.D. values in exponential phase (typically, from 0.05 to 0.16). 
The curve is obtained averaging in time S_cell values corresponding to exponential phase. 
</P><P>Error bars rapresent the minimum and maximum value of R.P.U. belonging to the range of O.D. in exponential phase. 
</P><P>In RPU evaluation the hypothesis of steady state has to be validated. This hypothesis corresponds to a constant behavior of S_cell in time. In exponential phase in several cases it is possible to observe that this variable isn't constant, but grows after exponential phase is over. This behaviour is totally unexpected and can't be justifyed by any biological argument.
</P><P>It is also important to underline that the reported methodology has shown how variable R.P.U. value can be. This parameter, in fact, is very sensitive to the respondind O.D. value, as shown from induction curves, where error bars are sometimes wide among the curve. So it is foundamental to define a standardized methodology for RPU evaluation, not sensitive to O.D. or time choose.
