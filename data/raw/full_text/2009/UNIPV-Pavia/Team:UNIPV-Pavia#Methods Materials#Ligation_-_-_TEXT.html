Protocols
LB medium
DNA resuspension from iGEM 2009 plates
Transformation
X-Gal staining protocol for beta galactosidase (blue/white screening)
Glycerol stocks
Plasmid extraction
BioBrick digestion with restriction enzymes
Electrophoresis
DNA gel extraction
DNA precipitation with sodium acetate
Ligation
PCR
Sensing ethanol concentration: our do-it-yourself kit
Ligation
(estimated time: 20 min + 12-16 hours overnight incubation)
(For every ligation)
Add 50 ng of vector
Add      
Heat DNA mix at 65°C for 5 min for DNA denaturation
Add 1 µl of T4 Ligase buffer
Add 1 µl of T4 Ligase
10 µl final volume
Incubate at 16°C overnight
Then, ligation can be conserved at 4°C or can be transformed
Before transformation you have to inactivate T4 Ligase:
Heat ligation at 65°C for 10 min.
INGREDIENTS:
Roche T4 Ligase
10X Roche T4 Ligase Buffer
