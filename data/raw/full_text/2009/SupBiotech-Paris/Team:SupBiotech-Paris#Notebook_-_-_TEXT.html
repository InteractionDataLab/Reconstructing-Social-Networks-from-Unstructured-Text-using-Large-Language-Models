Project Management
To organize our project as efficiently as possible was our first objective. Defining the schedule of the tasks to accomplish was necessary to elaborate efficiently our project in the shortest time span and at the best cost whilst bearing in mind the constraints imposed by the competition.
This is why we had to:
Plan: to determine the different operations to be done, the corresponding dates, and the material and human needs that have to be appointed.
Execute: by implementing the different operations defined in the planned phase.
Control: by carrying out a comparison between dates and accomplishments on the level of planning and execution.
In order to do this, each manager has warranted and controlled the coordination of the actors and tasks in a concern of efficiency and yield according to the time limits, thanks to the elaboration of Gantt plannings (that you can find below).
Planning of experiments:
You can find here the notebook that we filled with our experimentations and other events!
It starts on the 17th of August.
