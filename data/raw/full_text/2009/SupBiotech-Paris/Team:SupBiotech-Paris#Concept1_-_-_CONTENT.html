It should contain three essential characteristics. As a bacterial vector, it should not be pathogen for the patient, or at least not much harmful. It should have an interesting tropism, which means to be able to attain the target tissue. And finally, the most important characteristic, it must be able to foil the immune system, in order not to be destructed or eliminated before reach its objectives. 
During this chapter you will discover on which characteristics we based our reasoning to choose the best bacterium in term of efficiency. 
Then, you will discover in more details its properties through different constraint imposed by <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#DVS" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">DVS</A> concerning its 
<B>pathogenicity</B>, its <B>resistivity</B> and its <B>tropism</B>. 
Finally, we will present you <B>an improvement</B> brought to the bacterium in order to make an optimal tissue vector. </P><P><SPAN style="float: right"><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1">Back to top</A></SPAN></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_tissue_vector:_Mycobacterium_avium_.5B1.2C2.5D"> The tissue vector: <I>Mycobacterium avium</I> [1,2] </SPAN></H2><P>We studied several bacterial types to determine the best ratio between a low pathogenicity, an interesting tropism and a good resistance to the immune system, to choose the best tissue vector.
A hard task, cause in general rules, a microorganism which resists to the immune system is potentially dangerous for its host. We had to find a resistant microorganism but which does not have a high pathogenicity for humans. Indeed it is easier to reduce the pathogenicity than improve the resistance, we have chosen this last factor for the selection. 
At first, we list bacteria presenting a resistance to the immune system. The four most known are:
</P><DIV style="margin-left: 100px;"><P>- Mycobacterium tuberculosis, responsible agent for tuberculosis; 
- Legionella pneumophila, responsible agent for Legionnaire's disease; 
- Listeria monocytogenes, responsible agent for meningitis; 
- Coxiella burnetii, responsible agent for Q fever. </P></DIV><P>These four are of course highly pathogen, we looked then at their homologous or under-species less pathogen for humans. <I>Mycobacterium avium</I> (<I>M.avium</I>) is the bacterium which retains the most our attention. This last one belongs to Mycobacterium specie, and more precisely to the Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC). <I>M. avium</I> is less pathogen than its homologous <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I>. The only clinical manifestations it can induce are: productive cough, tiredness, fever, loss of weight and night sweat. These symptoms result from the colonization of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tractus and the possible diffusion in other parts of the body. Immunocompetent subjects having not a subjacent disease have a low risk to present infection symptoms by <I>M. avium</I>. Epidemiologic reports recently show that we find more and more the presence of <I>M. avium</I> in subjects, notably women who seem to have no pulmonary or immune predisposing trouble. Most of healthy subjects infected by <I>M. avium</I> have a <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#TC" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1">localized infection</A>; in contrast, we notice infection by <I>M. avium</I> disseminated in an important percentage of patients infected by AIDS (80% of colonized patients), as in other population of which the immune system is deficient, like subjects having a severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome or which received a transplantation and in patients treated by corticosteroids or cytotoxic medicines. <I>M. avium</I> seems to be one of the most interesting candidates to be the tissue vector. This bacterium resists to immune system and is few pathogen for Man. </P><P><SPAN style="float: right"><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1">Back to top</A></SPAN></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Immune_system_resistance_of_the_tissue_vector_.5B3.2C4.2C5.5D"> Immune system resistance of the tissue vector [3,4,5] </SPAN></H2><P><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#SI" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">Immune system</A> can be a terrible enemy, detecting and eliminating any element considered as foreign for the organism. Impossible to be stealth to it, it must be “hardened”. 
For that the tissue vector has two assets, a system to divert the immune system and a robust wall. </P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Immune_system_resistance_mechanism"> Immune system resistance mechanism </SPAN></H3><P>Bacteria like Mycobacterium <I>avium</I> developed resistance strategies highly specific to foil the <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#SI" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">Immune system</A>. 
So, M. <I>avium</I>, facultative intracellular microorganism, has the capacity to infect some cells of the immune system like macrophages or dendritic cells, responsible for phagocytosis. 
Infection generates phagocytosis death, and then we observe in the host a decrease of its non specific immunity, which permits to M. <I>avium</I> to persist in its host. </P><P>To fight against macrophages, M. <I>avium</I> inhibits phagolysosomes maturation, initially responsible of bacteria lysis. This mechanism paradigm is not already determined, but the principal hypothesis involves a cell wall glycolipid, the <B>lipoarabinomannan</B>.</P><P>To fight against dendritic cells, M. <I>avium</I> upsets cellular transduction signals by releasing some enzymes regulating the second messenger’s rate. 
</P><P>Indeed, M. <I>avium</I> has, in its genome, 12 genes containing classes III cyclase adenylate domains, the most important is Rv0386. This one facilitates the AMPc formation in macrophages. AMPc is a second messenger leading to the pro-inflammatory TNF-α cytokines synthesis.
But, at high concentration, TNF-α stops dendritic cells maturation and then the immune response sets off.</P><P>M. <I>avium</I> does not “fear anything” in front of the immune system, its elimination is low. It has the capacity to persist in the organism and therefore has more chance to attempt its target and to establish itself.</P><P><SPAN style="float: right"><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1">Back to top</A></SPAN></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Cell_wall_and_tissue_vector_envelope"> Cell wall and tissue vector envelope </SPAN></H3><P>Mycobacterium capacity to resist to the <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#SI" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">immune system</A> is essentially due to its wall and cellular envelope. These both present a complex structure and is specific to Mycobacterium.</P><P>Real breastplate, M. <I>avium</I> envelope is composed by several elements. Some, like soluble proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids are common to all bacteria. 
On the other hand others, specific to M. <I>avium</I>, are the most interesting, like these three insoluble macromolecules:
</P><DIV style="margin-left: 70px;"><P>- arabinogalactan,
- peptidoglycan, 
- mycolic acid. </P></DIV><P>
Together, these 3 constituents form the mycoylarabinogalactanpeptidoglycane (MAGP) heart of the cellular membrane. MAGP represents one of the two lipopolysaccharides (LPS) common to all mycobacteria, but M. <I>avium</I> possesses a second LPS: the lipoarabinomannan.
We observe as well, in M. <I>avium</I>, a glycopeptidolipids (GPL) lay as specific.
All this structure (MAGP, GPL and lipoarabinomannan) is highly immunogen like LPS is in others bacteria. Unlike to other bacteria, this complex structure gives a special resistance to M. <I>avium</I>. The network formed by the membrane, based on parallel hydrocarbonates, permits to the bacterium to be impermeable to several agent like ethanol, detergent or classical antibiotics.</P><P>
Tissue vector wall and its faculty to synthesize <B>cellular transduction hecklers</B> permit itself to be one of the only vector <B>to be resistant to the <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">immune system</A></B>. This is probably one of the major asset of the <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#DVS" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">DVS</A>.</P><P><SPAN style="float: right"><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1">Back to top</A></SPAN></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Targeted_tissu_of_the_DVS_.5B6.2C7.5D"> Targeted tissu of the DVS [6,7]</SPAN></H2><P><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#DVS" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">DVS</A> can be adapted to several pathologies in function of its tissue vector tropism. These last are linked to the tropism of M. <I>avium</I> “Wild type”, but it is possible to transform M. <I>avium</I> to make it sensible to some organic chemotactisms. Now, let’s discover what possibilities offer M. <I>avium</I> “Wild type”. 
M. <I>avium</I> can infect an organism by oral and intravenous way. If its homologous M. tuberculosis is often seen like a pulmonary pathogen agent, M. <I>avium</I> can eventually infect all organs. This affirmation is verified in immunodepressed patients in which the decreased immunity permits to the bacterium to propage in the entire organism. 
Deeper researches on tropism revealed some targeted organs. It is shown that weeks after infection, bacterium concentration reaches a plate in two organs: spleen and liver and later in a third one: lungs. </P><P><SPAN><I>Figure 2: Lung, spleen, liver and thymus invasion by M. </I>avium<I> from 0 to 52 weeks in log 10 (6 to 10 mice)</I></SPAN></P><P>
We observe as well that during several weeks post-infection, the bacterial amount still increases. Although, this increase in targeted tissues is not correlated with a Mycobacterium increase in blood. So, the increase is due to targeted tissues invasion and not to the entire body invasion. 
So, there is a tropism as well as an implantation of the vector in targeted tissues. This characteristic is really interesting because the vector is not circulating but resident. </P><P>The tissue vector first function is to deliver the <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2">cell vector</A> in the targeted organ. If the liberation is too early, the cellular vector has less chance to reach the interested cell. Alone, the <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2">cell vector</A> is eliminated by the organism, but in the tissue vector, it is safe.</P><P>The tissue vector possesses three interesting and identified tropisms. The <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept#DVS" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept">DVS</A> offers a therapeutic application for lungs, spleen and liver pathophysiologies.
The tissue vector can target these organs, implant them, and develop inside of these tissues, until receving the <B>delivery signal</B> of <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2">cell vector</A>.</P><P><SPAN style="float: right"><A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept1">Back to top</A></SPAN></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Delivery_system_of_the_cell_vector"> Delivery system of the cell vector</SPAN></H2><P>An implanted system in bacterium permits to control expression and then <A href="/Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2#drapeau" title="Team:SupBiotech-Paris/Concept2">cell vector</A> liberation.
