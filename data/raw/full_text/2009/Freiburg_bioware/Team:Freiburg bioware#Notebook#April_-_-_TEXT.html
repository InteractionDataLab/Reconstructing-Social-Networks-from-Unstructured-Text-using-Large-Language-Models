April
24th April 12:30 - 18:00 o'clock Manuel
Literaturrecherche zu FokI.
Entstandene Ideen:
three oligo's: two for binding the monomers and one to create a dsDNA where FokI can bind.
two oligo's: one for binding one monomer, the second for binding the second monomer and to create dsDNA (one monomer has to be inactivated).
one oligo: both binding sites of the monomers on one oligo (also one monomer has to be inactivated).
The 196 C-terminale aminoacids of FokI were used from other groups (see reference 1). Primersequences are also provided in the publication.
