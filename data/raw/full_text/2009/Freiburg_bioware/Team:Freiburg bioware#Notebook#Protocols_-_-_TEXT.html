Cast plates in the castingroom, its enough to cover just the bottom of the plates Sign the plates with date, iGEM and a green stripe on the lid when you added Ampicillin Close them and stack them in the castingroom, let them solidify under UV-light When they are soldified put them into the cooling room
Nano drop
start the PC, then start NP-1000 (Photometer) V3.7.1 username: FreiGEM, password: FreiGem1! choose type of measurement nucleic acid or protein put 1.5 µl water on the measure spot and click "OK" choose for nucleic acid if you want to measure DNA or RNA clean the spot and put again 1.5 µl water on it; click "Blank" measure your samples 1.5 µl each, clean between measurements after the measurement, clean with water use "Print Report" to get a printout for the labjournal

25µl dest H2O
- - -
50µl
put the eppi into the pcr machine, use the program Origami1 this will take about 2h. Heating and cooling steps are required for propper annealing of Oligo and ssDNA
digestion:
2µl FokI
3µl buffer 4(required for FokI, if you use a differennt enzyme look on NEB table)
25µl of the DNA solution(see above)
37°C room, shake for 2h
Agarosegel:use 50ml TAE-buffer, 0,5g Agarose, 500µl Cybergreen II(this stains ssDNA) look up dilution
Ligation
Combine 50 ng of vector with a 3-fold molar excess of insert. Adjust volume to 10 μl with dH2O.
Add 10 μl of 2X Quick Ligation Buffer and mix.
Add 1μl of Quick T4 DNA Ligase and mix thoroughly.
Centrifuge briefly and incubate at room temperature (25°C) for 5 minutes.
Chill on ice, then transform or store at -20°C.
Do not heat inactivate. Heat inactivation dramatically reduces transformation efficiency.
Strep-Tag Manual
After protein extract has entered the strep tactin matrix, wash column 5x with 1 CV (column volume) buffer W
Elute recombinant protein by the addition of 6 times 0.5 CV buffer E

Agarose-Formaldehyde Electrophoresis
10 x MOPS buffer:

The buffer is adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1M NaOH and sterilised by autoclaving.
RNA denaturing buffer:
10ml 100% deionized formamide
3.5ml 40% Formaldehyde (Take care: Formaldehyde is extremely toxic)
1.5ml 10 x MOPS buffer
Formamide is deionized by stirring 100ml with approximately 20g of Amberlite MB3 (or MB1) ion exchange resin for 15 minutes.
Agarose is prepared by melting the required amount of agarose in distilled water, cooling to approximately 60°C (hand hot) and adding 40% formaldehyde and 10 x MOPS to give 2.2M formaldehyde and 1 x MOPS, respectively. Example: For 50ml of a 1% agarose gel, melt 0.5g agarose in 37ml H2O, cool to hand hot, add 5ml 10 x MOPS buffer and 8.75ml 40% formaldehyde
