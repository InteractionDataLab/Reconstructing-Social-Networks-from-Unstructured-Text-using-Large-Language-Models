Collaboration
   
We helped the Freiburg_software team in designing and developing their Wiki-Page
For the modeling we worked closely together with the Freiburg_software Team. It would have been much more complicated for us without their mathematical knowledge. Thank you very much
Furthermore we helped team Valencia with 100% participation by filling out their survey for which we recieved a gold medal.
