I’m a happy and dreamy person who always fight for my dreams and my ideals. I feel I have a lot of love to give. I´m a lover of comunications: I´m addicted to facebook and twitter. I love biology because it makes me feel better, regardless of what happens in the world, biology is what makes my body move!

I have a colorful personality. When I have to work in the laboratory, I can be nagging ... but in moments of relaxation, everything’s different. I am a lover of music, dance. I am also a diehard and dedicated student. Additionally, I fully believe that laughter is the best medicine.

I like to learn from observing as well as by doing, listening to music and, reading, among other things. I always try to cease the moment. In the lab I am good at working with DNA, running gels; in general, I like to do anything that is so interesting.

Everything that I am and construct in my life day after day are my dreams, the happiness and hope with which I see what I do; this makes science and biology an integral part of who I am, eventhough I study with numbers, the passion to learn, the moments I share with my fellow teammates and my counselors make working in the lab a much more pleasurable and exciting experience. None of these experiences would be this wonderful if they hadn’t been with the International Park of Creativity.

My greatest passion is biomedical science, since it integrates the research with solving relevant health problemas; adittionally  it hypnotizes the philosophical feminine thought, especially that of Hipatia for her scientific approach.

I love listening to music, dance, and working in the laboratory, as well as   sharing with others and learning as much as I can from them. I like experiencing   new things and getting the best out of them. The International Park of   Creativity has been a wonderful experience for me to grow as a person and it has   also taught me to never give up and to do everything the best way I can. Through   this experience I've learned that everyone can find happiness by enjoying the   simple things in life.
