Working in the  lab has had its great moments as well as its difficult times that through  creativity and perseverance, we were capable of overcoming them. At the  beginning of the summer we started experiencing difficulties with the plasmid  DNA extractions. Since we were working with low-copy plasmids, we had to  increase the pellet size we were using by more than what we could’ve predicted.  Once we finally obtained the plasmid DNA, we began trying to carry out the  enzyme restriction digests. We faced a great amount of difficulty carrying them  out because of the required amounts of DNA and enzymes weren’t matching. 
Later on, we had  the bacterial sequences synthesized and we began thinking about how to build  our device. At first we tried setting it up and after several failed attempts  we decided to regroup and analyze all of our steps in order to identify our  error. We had brainstorming meetings, we looked up outside information, and we  worked as a team to fully understand the biological processes at hand.
Once we were  sure we understood what our mistakes were and why our device wasn’t being built  correctly, we could start anew. For this, we decided to designing artificial  restriction sites with the use of oligonucleotides that we, as a group, designed.   
Throughout the  summer we were constantly in contact with our mentor, Dr. Cuero, who was  guiding us through this experience. We frequently engaged in brainstorming  sessions in which we discussed the different steps of our project and proposed  new ideas. Additionally, he would always let us express our ideas and thoughts,  listening attentively and encouraging us to follow through with our ideas,  which in the end resulted in the overcoming of our obstacles.
We have also had the support of former IGEM competitor Silvana Saieh throughout   this experience. Having attended the IGEM in 2007, she has been able to guide us   through this experience making sure we are taking the right steps. She has also   played an important role in helping us prepare for the Jamboree.
Being this the  first time we’ve all worked in a lab and encountered these biological processes  and laboratory techniques, it was an incredible experience. Throughout the  summer we managed to get some things right the first time we tried, and other  times we made mistakes that in the end, only allowed us to learn even more. Our  mentor, Dr. Cuero, was always there making sure we were on the right path.  Whenever we encountered an obstacle, he’d give us the opportunity of finding  our own solution, in our own creative way, rather than just pointing it out.  For us, this lab experience wasn’t just about performing lab techniques; it was  more about learning, by doing.
