Mission
Our mission is to develop and enrich   creativity in teenagers to the service of the scientist and technologic   production, through an inductive research process in the areas of sciences, arts   and humanities.
  Vision
Our vision is to develop inventions,   products and innovative concepts of global impact, through applied sciences and   technology, generating social – economic Growth and development, promoting the   insertion to global markets.
 Dr. Raul Cuero (PhD / scientist / inventor,   USA) proposes as an economic development strategy for developing countries from   the International Park Of Creativity; to focus on making science and technology   where our products are globally competitive and transacted in hard currency.   These processes are already successfully underway in Colombia, United States and   Israel making progress in Africa, Mexico and Dominican Republic.
To achieve this purpose, we have outlined   are two main objectives:   
 1. To promote a culture of creativity to   productivity, thus creating a critical mass, based on the young resources of our   countries, these young scientists who will be trained to create and / or develop   products of global competition.
 2. To have the industry to channel efforts   in two ways: first by funding the process and second, by enjoying first hand   results.
