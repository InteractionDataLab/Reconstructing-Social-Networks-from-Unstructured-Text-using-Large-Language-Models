Why?
Some pesticides are very stable in their chemical structures and take years to  decompose to less toxic forms. In areas where these substances are  poured insecticide concentrations are increasing and although time has  passed since the last pesticide application will present permeating  everything.
In many cases they are also difficult to remove  biologically. When some organisms are being eaten by  other pesticide accumulates in greater proportions in the final stages  of the food chain. In this way a pesticide that is found in very low  concentrations, nothing dangerous, in a forest or a lake, turning out  to be in concentrations tens or hundreds of times higher even in some cases reaching us as  part of the food chain.
Pesticides in humans can cause death and in some cases long-term cancers,  the project plans to develop is a bacterium that is capable of  decomposing these pesticides, mineralizing these, for absorption  without further consequences.
 
 
How?
Different gene parts are being assembled, in order to construct a device          that is able to mineralize and biodegrade recalcitrant pesticides. The          device will be tested against different concentrations of different recalcitrant          pesticides. Specific chassis will be assembled with gene parts from different          metabolic pathways in order to finally reach mineralization of the pesticide.          Different parameters, such as DNA concentration, ATP concetration, fluorescence          of reporters, growth of bacterial device, and reduction of pesticide concentration,          will be used to assess the efficacy of the device. Computational modeling          will be used in order to complement the laboratory work.
