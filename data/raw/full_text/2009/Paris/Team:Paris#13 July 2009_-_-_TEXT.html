July 13th
Summary
here we are, this is the very beginning of our Notebook. At this point, we already decided what we gonna do during the next 3 months (that's a good think isn't it ? ). The past 3 week, we worked on the research bibliography part and on primers design.
Befor the 13th
what a mess for making our primers !!! But we found a lots of nice things :
TAT signal information (use for periplasm adressing).
ClyA: protein with exportable mutants.
Tol/pal system: use in outer membrane integrity.
PBP new : transduction signal system
FecABCD : another transduction system.
nice things but no so nice ('cause we're reaaaaly note sure):
Snares: target bacteria fusion system.
Adhésine: another target bacteria fusion system.
TCS: another another target bacteria fusion system...
Monday 13th
Finaly the manipulation step arrived, in fact, we need more tables !!
We juste have a presentation of a meeting about science for little kids we'll gonna participate. "Welcome Noobs we are scientists !!!"
Discovery of a new approach on OMV fusion with Jun and Fos, but Jun seems to make homodimers (that seems tricky here... but we'll think about it)
