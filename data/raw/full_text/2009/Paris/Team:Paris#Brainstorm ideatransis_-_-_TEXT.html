Bactotransistor
1. The idea
In this trend to create replica of electronical component we discussed the concept of a bacteria who could have two entry, one exit plus a logical gate.
2. How to
Two vesicles containing two different chemical compounds fuse with the same bacteria then it actives a network of genes that leads to  a unique specific response.
3. Approval
We discuss a lot about this idea, and we thought that it would be difficult to do this in so few time, but (because we like this 'but'), we discuss aroud this idea and come up with the final project : the Bacterial Protocol which is a part of this project.
result : OK
