Bactowifi
1. The idea
In the fun application part of our brainstorming, we thought that if we could have bacteria that could be responsive to radio wave such as the wifi frequencies, we could build a device to give the strength of the signal.
2. How to
Is there any protein or ARN that could change its conformation under a radio wave signal ? If yes, with a touch of fluorescent protein we could give a graduate response to the signal.
3. Approval
We have quickly found evidence that it would be very difficult to detect wifi wave : firstly because the frequency is in a band called ISM containing every kind of signal, so our bacteria will light up even if there is no Wifi, and secondly, because the strength of the signal is very weak and to sensitive.
