Lab work
Microscope
FM4-64 dying MG4 and Kayo delete Tol R
protocol n°2 (05/08/09) but using PBS
->nearly the same as MgSO4
protocol n°2 (05/08/09)but 1ml of cells and 1µl of dye, one with MgSO4 and one with PBS
->not enough  dye
Molecular Biology
Gel Migration
[Ladder 1kb| A1 |nothing| A2 |nothing| A3 ]using 1% agarose during 30min
A1 = Tg3p = 274bp (utiliser le ladder 100bp)
A2 = TE3 = 1036bp
A3 = ClyA (with RBS and poly G linker = 987bp
A1 and A2 didn't work we don't see it on the gel because it's not in E.Coli.
A3 didn't migrate very well
[Ladder 1kb|nothing| A5 |nothing| A5 |nothing] using 1% agarose during 30min
A5 = TolRII = 279bp
Purification and Digestion
Purification of A3 , A4 directly in micro-column, A5 , A6 using gel then micro-column
Digestion with XbaI and PSTI
New Miniprep
New Miniprep for P1 : pSB2K3, P13 : pSB1A3, P14 : BBa_K136050 (RBS tetR)
Result: Just good for trash. Make new ON culture.
Digestion by XbaI/PstI (XP) or XbaI/SpeI (XS)
P1 : pSB2K3 by XP
P2 : BBa_J61002 (plasmid backbone with RFP) by XS
P7 : Bba_R0040 (ptet) by XP
Digestion during 2h at 37°C.
Gel migration
Gel migration for P1 : pSB2K3, P2 : BBa_J61002 (plasmid backbone with RFP), P7 : BBa_R0040 (ptet)
[1kb|P1|P2|P7|100bp|/]
Result:
pSB2K3: wrong bande. Try again...
plasmid backbone with RFP: Wrong enzymes?!
ptet: good but the 1500bp band must not be there!
ON culture
ON culture for S8 : pSB2K3, S29 : pSB1A3, S30 : BBa_K136050 (RBS tetR) in order to done new miniprep
Transformation
Resuspention of biobrick BBa_J2479 (1L7)
Transformation in competent DH5α
