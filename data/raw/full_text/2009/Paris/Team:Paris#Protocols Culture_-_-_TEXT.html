Competent bacteria
Glycerol stock
Ferric citrate growth medium
Bacterial transformation
250µl of DH5α competent bacteria (by RbCl)
Add 2µl of DNA (ex Biobrick)
Incubation during 20min on ice
Heat choc 45second at 42°C
Leave on ice 2min
Add 1ml of LB preheated at 42°C
Incubation 1 hour at 37°C under agitation
Put 100µl of culture under plate
Centrifuge 2min at 6rpm MAX for 2 min
Put 100µl of concentrated culture
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Competent bacteria
CaCl2 (iGEM Paris2007)
CaCl2 (2nd Protocol)
RbCl
CaCl2 (iGEM Paris2007)
Prepare CaCl2 0.1M
Add 7,351g of CaCl2.2 H2O (FM 147,02) in 500 mL H2O
dissolve the CaCl2 by mixing the suspension with the help of a magnetic stirrer
Filter the solution with a cell-culture unit of filtration
Aliquotes the filtered solution: 25mL in a 50 mL Falcon. Storage at +4°C
Steps
Use non competent bacteria (ex: MG1655) stocked in 1.5 mL LB (20% Glycerol): put a sterile tip in the 1.5 mL stock tube and then place it in a 50 mL Falcon with 5 ml LB medium.
Over Night culture at 37°C / 200 rpm
1/100 dilution in LB medium QSP 50 mL in an erlenmeyer of 250 mL
Culture at 37°C / 200 rpm untill OD600 reach 0.6
Fast cooling at +4°C by gently shaking the erlen in ice
Use pre-cooled centrifuge at +4°C. Centrifuge 50 mL of the culture in 50 mL falcon: +4°C / 5 min / 4000 rpm
Discard supernatant by inverting the tube, and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold CaCl2 and mix gently the suspension by up and down
Add cold CaCl2 QSP 20 mL and incubate 30 min / +4°C
Centrifuge the suspension : +4°C / 5 min / 4000 rpm
Discard supernatant by inverting the tube, and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold CaCl2 and mix gently the suspension by up and down
Transform or freeze the competent cells. Freeze the competent cells in 50 µL aliquots in the 0.1M CaCl2 medium with 15% glycerol.
After transformation, prepare a Glycerol stock
CaCl2 (2nd Protocol)
Inoculate 50/5 ml of LB with fresh colony or dilution of an overnight culture
Grow up to OD600 0.5-0.8
Leave on ice 10min
Spin 40/2 ml of cell suspension, 5min at 4000rpm, 4°C/minispin 2min at 5000rpm, 4°C
Resuspend the pellet in 20/1 ml CaCl2 50mM (1/2 of initial Vol)
Leave on ice 10min
Spin 40/2 ml of resuspension, 5min at 4000rpm, 4°C/minispin 2min at 5000rpm, 4°C
Resuspend the pellet in 2ml/100µl CaCl2 50mM (1/20 of initial Vol)
Leave on ice overnight before stock at -80°C
