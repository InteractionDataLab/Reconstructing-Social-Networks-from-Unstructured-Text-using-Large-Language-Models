3.2Steps
Protocol to make competent bacteria (iGEM2007)
Prepare CaCl2 0.1M
Add 7,351g of CaCl2.2 H2O (FM 147,02) in 500 mL H2O
dissolve the CaCl2 by mixing the suspension with the help of a magnetic stirrer
Filter the solution with a cell-culture unit of filtration
Aliquotes the filtered solution: 25mL in a 50 mL Falcon. Storage at +4°C
Steps
Use non competent bacteria (ex: MG1655) stocked in 1.5 mL LB (20% Glycerol): put a sterile tip in the 1.5 mL stock tube and then place it in a 50 mL Falcon with 5 ml LB medium.
Over Night culture at 37°C / 200 rpm
1/100 dilution in LB medium QSP 50 mL in an erlenmeyer of 250 mL
Culture at 37°C / 200 rpm untill OD600 reach 0.6
Fast cooling at +4°C by gently shaking the erlen in ice
Use pre-cooled centrifuge at +4°C. Centrifuge 50 mL of the culture in 50 mL falcon: +4°C / 5 min / 4000 rpm
Discard supernatant by inverting the tube, and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold CaCl2 and mix gently the suspension by up and down
Add cold CaCl2 QSP 20 mL and incubate 30 min / +4°C
Centrifuge the suspension : +4°C / 5 min / 4000 rpm
Discard supernatant by inverting the tube, and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of cold CaCl2 and mix gently the suspension by up and down
Transform or freeze the competent cells. Freeze the competent cells in 50 µL aliquots in the 0.1M CaCl2 medium with 15% glycerol.
After transformation, prepare a Glycerol Stock
2nd Protocol for competent bacteria
Inoculate 50/5 ml of LB with fresh colony or dilution of an overnight culture
Grow up to OD600 0.5-0.8
Leave on ice 10min
Spin 40/2 ml of cell suspension, 5min at 4000rpm, 4°C/minispin 2min at 5000rpm, 4°C
Resuspend the pellet in 20/1 ml CaCl2 50mM (1/2 of initial Vol)
Leave on ice 10min
Spin 40/2 ml of resuspension, 5min at 4000rpm, 4°C/minispin 2min at 5000rpm, 4°C
Resuspend the pellet in 2ml/100µl CaCl2 50mM (1/20 of initial Vol)
Leave on ice overnight before stock at -80°C
Protocol for competent bacteria by RbCl
Solution for competent bacteria (by RbCl)
Tampon I (250ml)
Potassium acetate (C2H3KO2 30mM pH 5,8 0,733g
RbCl 100mM    3,02g
CaCl2 10mM   0,3741g
MnCl250mM   2,5g
Glycerol 15%    ~37,5ml
QS 250ml H2O  ~218,5ml
Adjust with Acetic acid (CH3COOH 100%)to pH 5,8. (Remake the solution if pH beneath 5.8
Sterilization (filtration).
Tampon II (125ml)
MOPS 10mM pH 6.5   0,2382g
RbCl 10mM    0,150g
CaCl2 10mM   1,37gg
Glycerol 15%    ~18,75ml
QS 1250ml H2O  ~106.25ml
Adjust pH to 6.5 with KOH 1M
Sterilization (filtration)
Steps
Over night culture (O.N.C)
Competent
50mL of LB with 0.5mL O.N.C
Wait for 5.6 OD600
10mn on ice
centrifuge 10mn at 4000 RPM
resuspend the bacteria pellet in 18mL Tampon I
10mn on ice
centrifuge 10mn at 4000 RPM
resuspend the bacteria pellet in 8mL Tampon II
Alicot 250µL/tube at -80°C
Transformation plasmid (10pg/µl)
250µl of RbCl competent DH5α
12,5µl plasmid
Leave 20 min in ice
45s at 42°C
Leave 2 min in ice
Add 1ml of hot LB (42°C)
1h at 37 under agitation
Put on plate (LB agar + Antibiotic)
culture
take 100µL and spread it on the plate (LB + Antibiotic)
centrifuge 2mn the left
take 100µL and spread it on the plate (LB + Antiobotic)
