Results and Discussion
Main | Delay model | Vesicle model | Fec simulation
Introduction | Fec Operon | Deterministic and stochastic simulations | Results and conclusion
The results obtained both for deterministic and and stochastic simulations are different. Of course, running deterministic simulations, one always gets the same result and behaviour; nevertheless, while running stochastic simulations, the results are different.
