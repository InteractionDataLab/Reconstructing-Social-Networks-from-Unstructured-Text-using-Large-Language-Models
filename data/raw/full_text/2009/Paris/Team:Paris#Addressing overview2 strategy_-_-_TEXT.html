Addressing the message in the membrane : Our strategy
Main | ClyA | OmpA | Our strategy | Construction
Our strategy is to use clyA to export a protein to the outer-membrane of the cell. The protein fused to clyA will be incorporated into the vesicle during the vesiculation process and it's also express on the surface. ClyA contain the signal peptide required for the exportation process from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The overall idea is to fused the protein of interest to clyA.
So in a first time in order to see if our ClyA are localize in OMVs, we fused it we a RFP. For that we add a poly glycine linker to ClyA biobrick to improve ClyA-RFP fusion. Moreover if we put RFP before ClyA, it seem that there is more fluorescence than ClyA before RFP under [1] . You can see the contruction here
Then if this test work, we could replace the RFP by the protein of interest for signal transduction, moreover this system couple to fec system can transduct a signal from outer membran to the cytoplasm.
