Lab work
Yesterday transformations results
g3p ON ligation at 16°C
Negative control concentrated = 0 bacteria
1:1 concentrated = 1 bacteria
1:7 concentrated = 1 bacteria
ClyA ON ligation at 16°C
Negative control concentrated = 0 bacteria
1:1 rapport = 0 bacteria
1:7 rapport = 0 bacteria
1:1 concentrated = 10 bacteria
1:7 concentrated = 0 bacteria
Miniprep
For the 6 positives clone of pFecA
Glycerol Stock
For clone n°1 and n°2
333ul of Glycerol 60%
666ul of ON culture
Mix and store at -80°C
Digestion
Digestion for the 6 clones of pFecA ligation, by XbaI and PstI
Mix
DNA (Miniprep) : 5ul
XbaI : 1ul (I think it's too much...but I think to this after doing it)
PstI : 1ul
BSA 100x : 0,2ul
Buffer NEB2 10x : 2ul
H2O : 9ul
2h at 37°C
Gel migration
1,5% agarose gel
5ul drop
Good profil, expected band at 130bp. Maybe not enough digest bu we clearly see the 130bp band corresponding to the insert (pFecA). The 2000bp band correspond to pSB1A3
ON culture
DH5α in order to done more competent bacteria (the stock is shrinking)
4 g3p clones (7ml + 7ul Amp)
PCR screening
Same protocol as yesterday
Screening of 4 clones (maybe I invert the n°2 and the n°4)
Gel migration
g3p is around 1450bp... Second confirmation tomorrow but it seems very good!
