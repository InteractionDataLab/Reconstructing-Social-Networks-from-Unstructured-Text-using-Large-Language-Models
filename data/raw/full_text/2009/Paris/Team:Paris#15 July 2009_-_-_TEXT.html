Summary
The big boss is here.
10 AM :  meeting time first episode.
After a little cheers on the fact that our project seems not to be so bad but the Pekin team will run over us (they seems to work until 11PM O_o), we had a little overview on our diffrents parts (Yea right ! We need a supervisor for each part on wich we can yell at if it doesn't work !)
We cut our project in 5 parts:
OMV Production
Signal Transduction
Periplasm signal
Fusion vesicle
Control mecanism on targeting protein in vesicle
5PM: Meeting strick back !
We did our powerpoint, 3 hours of works on 5 differents teams for a 31 pages presentation... what a mess !
2 idears of Mr When-i'm-here-we-don't-laught:
why not sending an enzyme into the periplasm which finaly creat a signal in it (eg, cutable signalisation protein witch becam activated)
why don't we send a working PBP ?
thaaaaat's a realy good proposition ! realy not those we'll gonna trough away in the garbage...
