Fusion
Fusion : the construction required for the fusion of the vesicles that contain the message.

G3P
Even though it has not been realized, we planned to do these experiments to verify that G3P is expressed into the bacterial surface and induces the membranal fusion.
Surface expression of G3P
Surface expression of G3P could be seen with antibodies.
Culture of bacteria expressing OmpA-linker-G3P construction on a membrane. Adding antibodies anti-G3P. Revelation should shows whether G3P is expressed at the surface of bacteria.
Floculation test
"Fusion" could be approached by a flocculation test.
Two separate bacterial population growth on media. A population (F-) expressing the OmpA-linker_G3P construction and a population (F +) which express sexual pilus (by expression of the episome F).
Then we growth bacteria without agitation and we look (compared to culture controls) the speed of sedimentation. Faster sedimentation is due to an interaction between bacterial populations showing an increase of contact time. At vesicle level, it induce membrane fusion.
