Bactocolored vegetable
1. The idea
Never dream of tree with a green trunk, cyan leaves, and red roots and twinkling ? We do !
2. How to
We need to design biosensors that could be able to sense a specific binding to a characteristic region of a vegetables  consequently we need to find  way to bind specifically with those regions,  then  to be able to produce vesicles that would signal to other bacteria their presence and to incorporate a oscillator to regulate the production of luminescent protein.
3. Approval
Totally useless and with too much challenge , even just docking would be a miracle !
result : rerefused because we refused not to refused it.
