Brain work
We encountered difficulty to begin the experiments in the morning , because we still lack lab furniture.
Real work  started in the afternoon, while two of us participated to the "festival des sciences" event.
Unluckily no one comes and we started the conference  just between the present scientists and us. The debate tackle a lot of ethic problem, like what are the responsability of he scientists involved in a work that is an extension of previous one ? Is it because we can that we should ?
Lab work
