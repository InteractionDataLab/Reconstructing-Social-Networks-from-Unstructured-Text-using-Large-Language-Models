Membran Fusion : Our Strategy
Main | Fusion | Our strategy | Construction
Jun/Fos strategy
Our strategy is to fuse the mutated Jun (the one unable to form homodimer) to AIDA, the autotransporter (for the donnor cell). By this way, Jun will be export to the outer membrane and should be on vesicles. The second step is to make a fusion between Fos and AIDA (for the receiver bacteria). In this direction Fos will be trasport to the outer membrane .
g3p strategy
g3p is naturally exposed at the surface of the filamentous bacteriophage. The M13 phage has a high affinity for E.coli, and if we could place its g3p on the surface of the vesicles it could activate the fusion with the Outer membrane of the targeted bacteria.
Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is a major structural protein of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.
To conclude, our strategy is to fuse OmpA-Linker to g3p to export the g3p protein to the outer membrane in order to find them on the vesicles surface.
