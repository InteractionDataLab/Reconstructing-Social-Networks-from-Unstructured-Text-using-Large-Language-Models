Addressing parts
Main | Production | Addressing | Reception | RBS
For this part we are going to use the plasmid backbone pSB2K3 .
The promoter pBAd used was found in the parts registry BBa_K11309 as well as the double terminator : BBa_B0014 .
The RBS were designed by Guillaume Cambray and integrated directly inside the primers.
