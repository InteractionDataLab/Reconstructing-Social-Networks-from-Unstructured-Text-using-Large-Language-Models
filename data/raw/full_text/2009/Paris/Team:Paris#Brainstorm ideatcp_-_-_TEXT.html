Bacterial Protocol
This is it !!! finally we did it :) this is our idea, the last one, the very last on lost in the huge group of 'ideas' (obviously a lot of them mustn't have the idea label...).
Why, why this one ? In fact here isn't the place for discuss that, but to be quick we came up with this idea just after the Bactotransistor . We thought, how can we make 2 vesicles and targeting a unique bacteria. At this point, we search a lots of papers dealing with OMV, and understand that this technique isn't really known. so before trying to make a transistor we agreed of trying to master the OMV production and adressing ; welcome to the Message in a bubble a way to a new bacterial language :D
