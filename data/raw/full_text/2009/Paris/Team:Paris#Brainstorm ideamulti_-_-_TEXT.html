Multigenomic microorganism
1. The idea
We would like to create an organism able to have specific abilities depending on the external conditions, for example in a reactor, the bacteria could catalyze a reaction that requires high temperature and catalyze the rest of the reaction at low temperature.
2. How to
We need to implant the genome of an extremophile in another bacteria, and to have a plasmid that would serve as a switch between the expression of the two genomes.
3. Approval
Very interesting but it required 5 years for a team to successfully implant the genome from a bacteria to another.
