The
Schueller Bettencourt Fondation
was created by Mrs Liliane Schueller Bettencourt and her family, in the memory of her father Eugene Schueller, founder of L’Oréal. It helps to initiate, support and develop projects in the medical, cultural and humanitarian fields.
The foundation is active in the following areas:
• Medical research : The foundation supports the research through two types of actions : the assistance to the researchers and the support for the education (as example the foundation generously supports the FdV-Liliane Bettencourt PhD program).
• Culture : The foundation supports talented artists or craftsmen and attempts to make known or to acknowledge works of great quality, whether from the past or present.
• Social/humanitarian relief : It really important for the Foundation to provide help for associations that are  engaged in social and humanitarian actions. Through these, it contributes to relieve particularly difficult situations and to give new opportunities to children and adults in adversity.
Embassy of France in Washington
Since the begining of the parisian iGEM adventure, embassy of France in Washington supports our team. Through this action, the ambassy would like to promote the "french science" out of France and wants to improve the mobility/the intelectual development of young (and motivated) researchers .
In 1778, Louis XVI decided to create at the Hôtel des Monnaies (the Mint) "a Chair of mineralogy and metallurgical docimasy, in which the professor appointed by the King will give free public lessons in this science".     Since 1946 a foundation was created, the FI3M foundation of the
Mines Paristech
school supported by the graduate students of this school was created.    This association has to promote the high quality of the school all around the world, and to maintain the school at its bests level. To perform these mission, FI3M play an important role in different domains such as:
• Social and administrative support for the students
• Support for the foreign students and for the international policy of the school
• Support for fundamental research
• Support for real-estate projects or projects connected to the heritage of the School
INRIA, the French national institute for research in computer science and control, operating under the dual authority of the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Industry, is dedicated to fundamental and applied research in information and communication science and technology (ICST). The Institute also plays a major role in technology transfer by fostering training through research, diffusion of scientific and technical information, development, as well as providing expert advice and participating in international programs.     By playing a leading role in the scientific community in the field and being in close contact with industry, INRIA is a major participant in the development of ICST in France.   The Institute's strategy closely combines scientific excellence with technology transfer. INRIA's major goal for 2008-2012 is to achieve scientific and technological breakthroughs in seven priority domains:
•Modelling, simulation and optimisation of complex dynamic systems
•Programming: security and reliability of computing systems
•Communication, information, and ubiquitous computing
•Interaction with real and virtual worlds
•Computational engineering
•Computational sciences
•Computational medicine
In close collaboration with the world of health since its creation in 2002, the mission of
EchoSens
is to provide the medical field with new global diagnostic solutions.    The mission of EchoSens is to offer hepatologists an ergonomic environment that generates and organises the clinical data necessary for the physician to make diagnoses and provide therapeutic treatment to patients.    EchoSens is currently a world leader in the field of transient elastography, after the success of a first in vivo device sold worldwide, the FibroScan® and its dedicated probes.
Thirty-five people contribute by their knowledge and expertise in an organisation centred around three main areas of activity:
• Health This area is focused on providing physicians with a panel of tools and services in order to facilitate their daily work.
• System This area is focused on fully managing the development of product, the integration of the technology as recycling and after-sales service.
• Laboratory It is in the laboratory that the most innovative ideas for developing new device with the most advanced technology are developed.
New England Biolabs
is dedicated to providing research products of the highest purity to the worldwide scientific community and supports this dedication with extensive quality control testing, a commitment to customer service and an intensive research and development program.    At NEB, basic research is a priority. Well established in their respective fields, including Molecular Biology and Parasitology, NEB scientists routinely publish their work in the leading journals, present research at scientific conferences, host visiting scholars from around the world, and supervise post-doctoral fellows. To date, over 630 papers have been published by NEB scientists, in addition to many patents that have been received.     NEB also offer a number of summer internships to undergraduate students as well as year round internships to local high school students.
Scientific contributors
We are particularily grateful to Dr. Roland Lloubes (CNRS - Institut de Microbiologie de la Méditerranée). He kindly provided us with his genetic constructs to destabilize the E. coli's outer-membrane (even twice, due to a poor mail reception service at the Cochin Institute where we are based). He was also very helpful in answering our questions regarding membrane stability and its links with the Tol/Pal system.
We would also like to thanks Pr. Volkmar Braun and Dr. Silke Patzer for providing some plasmids and advices on the Fec transduction system
We deeply regret that we do not had the chance to thanks Dr. Matthew DeLisa because he DID NOT WANT TO SHARE his published plasmids containing clyA-GFP fusion. We don't think this to be a good scientific endeavor...
People at the Interdisciplinary Research Center (CRI)
The Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity provides us with a scientific atmosphere and physical location to brainstorm, define and concretize our project as well as lab facilities within the Evolutionary Systems Biology team of the U571 INSERM Unit.  Special thanks a lot to
Ariel Lindner
