Protocols suggested
Main | Microscope Protocols | Adapted Protocols | Culture Protocols | Molecular biology
Bacteria culture
Chose different colors beware incompatibility with GFP+YFP (green and yellow to close)
Membrane bacteria coloraiton with DID
Blade preparation
(do this step a few hours before; the blade need to be dry)
Clean the glass blade
Put the small blade on it (the blue square)
Prepare the 1,5% Agarose + LB, boil it (microwave), let it cooling down
take 50 µL agarose, put it in the middle of the blue square on the blade.
put on it another blade, beware do not make bubbles, press it until 30sec
10min at 4°C
Cells preparation
Resuspend bactéria in 1mL LB in an ependorff tube
Quick centrifugation (low RPM)
Blade
Take back the blade from the fridge
Pull off the upper blade (slide it)
Cut exceeded Agarose (if we want multiple observation, cut few Agarose)
Put cells on the agarose gel (1µL)
dry it with air agitation
put a little blade on the bigger one, beware of bubbles
Microscopy observation
power on the computer (what a nice idear)
light up the 4 switch starting from the right one
light up the green one
stay at 37°C
use MetaMorph sotware
put the blade
adjuste (use oil if you use x100)
choose "Trans No Filter" (white light)
use Acquire->Acquire->More
take care of camera temperature (need to stay at -30°C
Show live (if no image verify the display position)
Setting Modified (exposition settings)
if " Trans No Filter" (at the begining): put "100 ms trans on"
if filter (CFP, GFP, etc...): put "1s fluo at"
if it's not lean yet: put "4s fluo at"
Beware we didn't have all the filter (GFP for example). If we want the RFP filter, we need to take the last one...
>Acquire for picture or >Show live
When it's done
Slide up the camera
Use the joystick to take out the blade
Clean the camera with kodak paper
wait 30min for the 1st switch starting from the left
Time laps variant
>Journal/edit journal
>igem/journal/TLPS_phase.JNL
Choose in the TEST file, edit filter, positions, time etc....
Run journal on TEST, >stop
