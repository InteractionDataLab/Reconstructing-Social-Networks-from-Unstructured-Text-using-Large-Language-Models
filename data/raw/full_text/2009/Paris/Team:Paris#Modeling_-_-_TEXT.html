Vesicles Maturation Modeling
This part of the modelling works was dedicated to the vesicles creation understanding. Indeed if we want to control the emission of vesicles we need to discuss phenomenon which lead it. We decided to attach ourselves to the biophysics of the problem and especially on the biophysics of membranes. We finally linked the creation of vesicles to the free diffusion of PAL and TOL proteins in the membranes depending of the lipidic bilayer shapes.
The conformation of the lippopolysaccharides and the normal phospholipids J'ai suggéré quelque part de faire des rappels de la biologie des membranes des gram-negatifs et E. coli en particulier.

Osmotic pressure increase due to the Cell Wall turnover  and the Tol/Pal distinct location can explain the formation of blebbing
the hypothesis made in Reference about a link between vesicles creation and the turnover of the peptidoglycan act as  a physical motor for our model : Indeed during the division of the cell, the peptidoglycan is degraded and reconstructed to be given a new shape. This turnover isn’t perfect: a part of the murrains components are released in the periplasm which make locally increased the pressure and so cause the local deformation of the outer membrane.  Defects in the TOL-PAL system leads to vesicles maturation reference. We can consider that TOL-PAL is acting as mooring ropes. So the distribution of TOL-PAL in the lipidic bilayer would be vital for the integrity of the outer membrane of the bacteria and any defect in those distributions can lead to vesicle maturation if there is any increase of the periplasm pressure. During vesicle creation Tol-Pal system act as counter forces to the osmotic pressure increase unabling a global swelling of the outer membrane. Using those types of information we create a 2 dimension model to explain the formation of blebbing
Brownian diffusion in the membranes can explains the affinity for concave region of outer membrane in bacteria and local clustering on the border of blebbing.
Our hypothesis to this model is that simple Brownian diffusion on the surface can explain stable accumulation of TOL and PAL in the border of the blebbing ( Link toward Details). Indeed physically it appears that Brownian motion model on a non-plane surface doesn’t predict a non uniform concentration of particles. They will aggregate themselves in the highly concave areas of membranes. This prediction is in agreement with some observation about Tol/Pal Reference and some experiments were done which confirm a phenomena in Reference which is the accumulation of proteins in the septa region during E.coli division but not explained efficiently by simple biology mechanism.
Brownian Diffusion predict disparition of the borders of vesicles in creation phases.
The direct area caught inside the border of the blebbing is highly and negatively curved , so we can predict a migration of Tol-Pal complexes and Pal proteins toward this area : the Tol/Pal complexes are zippering back the membrane to the peptidoglycan but not efficiently enough to ensure the whole contrition of the blebbing: two different areas are separated.
