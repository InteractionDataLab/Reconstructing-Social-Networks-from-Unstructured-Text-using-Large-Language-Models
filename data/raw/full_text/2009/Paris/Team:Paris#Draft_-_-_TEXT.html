iGEM Paris Team
Hello everyone! welcome to our wiki. It's the 3rd year for the Paris Team and we're still motivated to do our best. This year we have a team of 13 students (what a luck). We are 6 biologists, 2 mathematicians, 1 computer scientist, 1 sociologist, 1 infectiologist, 1 geneticist, and 1 chemist. We've got the best of the best of the best supervisors like Ariel Lindner, Guillaume Cambray and Samuel Bottani. So... let's the contest begin! (See our team here ). Draft Page de presentation à revoir: plus positive et pas nécessairement liée aux années précédentes. Plus positive : nous sommes encore motivées... Encore heureux! Soyez factuels sur cette année.
