The garland
1. The idea
Boost your Xmas garland with our super bacteria ! In each section a colony of bacteria receiving vesicles from the previous one will emit colored light and vesicles that will activate the next colony of bacteria. Moreover, we could create funny patterns by incorporating  oscillators.
2. How to
We need to design biosensors to incorporate a oscillators and which be able to produce vesicles, but also, which can avoid the bacteria to freely move in the garland and in the meantime to enabled vesicles to travel.
3. Approval
At first sight , it could be funny , but in the end it is too useless...
result : refused
