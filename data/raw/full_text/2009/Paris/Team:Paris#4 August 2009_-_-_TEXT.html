Brain work
A lot of meeting today: First on for the modeling explication and application of stochastic model ? The second one on every parts and each member's work explanation. We still arguing about the travel agency for the Jamboree...Waaaaaaaaa
Lab work

Biobrick resuspention
1/1K named 1K1 (pSB1A3). Resistant to Ampicilin.
Transformation of precited Biobrick
1K1 (pSB1A3) in competent DH5α by RbCl
Purification
Purification of P3,P4,P5,P7 with  XbaI PstI (using 1,5% agarose because pb is inferior to 100pb during 25 min)And P8 with (1%Agarose during 25 min because pb is superior to 1kpb).
D1= P3 Digested=66pb, D2= P4 Digested=95pb, D3= P5 Digested=37pb, D4= P7 Digested=54pb, D5= P8 Digested=1210pb, (D4 seems to be bad because we don't see his specific band during a gel after is purification)
P1 didn't work (we don't have the specific band after the digestion so we can't putificate it), P2 purification, for tomorrow
Gel for check the purification[Ladder 100bp|P3|P4|P5|P7|nothing|ladder 1kb|P8]
D1=Works, D2=Works, D3=Doesn't work(his band not correspond at 37pb), D4=Doesn't work(no band), D5=Work not well (2 bands)
