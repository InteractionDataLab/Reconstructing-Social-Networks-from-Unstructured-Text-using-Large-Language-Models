BactoTV
1. The idea
Every pixel of our screen will be composed of 3 colonies of bacteria sensitive to different compounds and able to emit fluorescence respectively green, red, yellow and with a microfluidic system we could deliver precisely the compound the create bioimage.
2. How to
We need to design biosensors , to find transduction pathway and to make sure the bacteria keep surviving.
3. Approval
It Could be fun, but it also lacks of utility when we need a "Save the world" project.
