Addressing the message in the membrane : Construction
Main | ClyA | OmpA | Our strategy | Construction
Here the activation of our construction by arabinose, in order to test the construction.
Here the inhibition of our construction by glucose, in order to test the construction.
Here the activation of our construction by arabinose.
It is quite the same as the first construction, but in [1 ] the RFP-Cter link to Nter-ClyA seems to have a better fluorescence. Because of our late about receiving the oligo for its synthesis in biobrick format, we used the first construction (ClyA-Cter link to Nter-RFP).
