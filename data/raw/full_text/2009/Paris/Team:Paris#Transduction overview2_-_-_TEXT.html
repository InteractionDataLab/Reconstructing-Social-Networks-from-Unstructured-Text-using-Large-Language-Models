Signal transduction: Main
Main | Transduction | Our strategy | Construction
This part of the project was focus on the following point:
The activation of the transcription of a genetic construction after fusionning the OMVs with the outer membrane of the receiving bacterium.
The sinequanone conditions : we tried to achieve this aim without sacrifying important proprieties of our message : specific, repeatable , multidirectional.
It seems that we have two possible ways : the ABC transporters or the two component systems.
ABC transporters and two component systems are natural transport systems (export or import) of nutriments or toxines, and even information but the mecanism is mostly unknown so the DNA-containing OMVs  would have been a useful mean of information transport if it would not be so unknown.  Here for information about ABC transporter and Two Component System .
Our strategy and Construction part explains our aim in this OMV production system.
