1.1.1A.1. Before
1.1.2A.2. The transition
1.2B. External meeting and participation to  scientific non-iGEM linked events
Brainstorming
In this section, every single thought and train of thoughts will be unveiled !
We offer you the opportunity to find the answer you are looking for, or to discover new questions and reflexions. In order to satisfy your demand we choose to proceed by ideas. Furthermore  you will follow the team step by step in his reflexion, we would also be very grateful if you wanted to share some thoughts with us.

A. Internal meeting
We start the weekly meetings at the end of April,  we quickly  agreed to meet once a week, and Thursday seems to match with our respective timetables. Since we have found our subject of study, we can separate those before and those after the choice.
A.1. Before
at the very begin was chaos ! follow the descent to hell :
And the light embraced our universe ! In other word, an abundance of project. Some of them are not listed below otherwise it would have been a disgrace to this competition.
chronological order:
eucaryotic plasmid
multigenomic microorganism
bactowifi
bacterioclock: how to know what time is it on a petri dishes
bactocompass
bactoTV
bacteriopatch : patch to monitorize disease
A.2. The transition
The iGEM WEEKEND !!!!!!
and the application for the project that followed :
bactotransistor
The TCP/Bacterial Protocol.
bact-arkanoïd.
christmas garland.
bactocolored vegetal.
B. External meeting and participation to  scientific non-iGEM linked events
Some of us have assisted to specific conference.
05/04/2009: "From Synthetic Chemistry to Synthetic Biology" , amphithéâtre Maurice Halbwachs, Collège de France
05/28/2009: "Will we be able to create a synthetic bacterium ?" with Antoine Danchin Professor from the Pasteur institute SYLVAIN
06/04/2009: "Engineering the living 2.0 , the synthetic biology in questions."   Centre Pompidou find here the conference and debate to come
06/09/2009: "Learning from bacteria about information processing" Prof E. Ben -Jacob at the CRI   SYLVAIN
We have participated in a event that aims to popularize science for all kind of public.
07 / 22 & 23 & 24 / 2009 "Festival des sciences" organized by Paris montagne at the ENS ULM
