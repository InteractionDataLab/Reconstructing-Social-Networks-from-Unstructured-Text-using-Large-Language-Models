Adressing the message to the cytoplasm : Our strategy
Export system | Our Strategy | Construction
We thought of overexpressing the important proteins in the Tat pathway (that is to say TatABCE) in order to avoid the early saturation phenomenon that is likely to occur when we will overexpress proteins that will be targeted to the outer membrane or to the periplasm.
However, in our strategy, the only protein that needs to use the TAT pathway to translocate from the cytoplasm to the periplasm is clyA. Finally, we decided that the overexpression won't be necessary neither for the TAT pathway, nor for the SEC pathway, both of them constitutively expressed in E Coli K12.
