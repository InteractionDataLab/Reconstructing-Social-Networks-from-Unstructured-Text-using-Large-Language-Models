Bacterioclock
1. The idea
For scientist in a lab that don't possess a clock, we propose a petri dish on which the bacteria move on 2 concentric circles at different speed ( a circle for the minutes , one for the hours ) in addition to an easy detectable signal of presence. (yes we know ... we're a little bit crazy...)
2. How to
We could trace a path, avoid the phosphorilated form of cheY and add a tunable and robust oscillator to control the timing of the movements.
3. Approval
Useless and unreliable what else ?
result : Deep into the trash, very deep :D
