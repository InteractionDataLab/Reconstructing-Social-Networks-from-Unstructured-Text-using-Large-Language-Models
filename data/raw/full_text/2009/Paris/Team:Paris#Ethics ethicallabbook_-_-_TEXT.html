Main - Methodology : Real time ethical reflexion
Main | Introduction | Practices | Implications in our project
As other iGEM 09 teams, we plan to have a significant ethical reflection component as part of our « message in a bubble » project in particular and synthetic biology in general.
Thus, we launched an anthropological study of the Paris team in parallel with the iGEM 09 competition preparation, coupled with ethical reflection, and it lead us to perform it in a special way. We decided to have an everyday thematic one hour talk about ethics and social practices in science and biology. We decided to make these talks reachable for everyone, even if something more constructed will be, at least, produce. You'll find on this wiki page the talk reports, with questions asked to the team and the main argument of the discussions. It should also be considered as an exercise and a report of experimental and anthropological thought. This should be regarded as an ethical and anthropological « lab book », as an everyday, real time look on the reflection of the Paris' team about these kind of questions.
Enjoy our daily mileage in ethics, sociology, life science and synthetic biology !
