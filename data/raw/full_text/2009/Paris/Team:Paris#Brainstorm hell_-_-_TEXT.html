From Hell
the very beginning:
Everything began in a small room overcrowded by aliens that seems to come from very different universes.  It was an awkward meeting where everyone was wondering if he didn't just get lost, until the curtain came down and Ariel gathered us all around a slide where the basic concepts of the synthetic biology stood.
Brilliant ! In a few second the perspective of an thrilling project overwhelmed us with motivation. Nevertheless a small one-to-one interview was necessary just to confirm that every team member could fulfill his duty as a servant of the iGEM project.
It was the 29th of April ! The beginning of a great series of brainstorming. Various kind of brainstorming process were performed.
