Lab work
Transformation check
Transformation of yesterday (12/08) doesn't work, we have colonies in all the 3 box (2 with inserts and vector and 1 negative control with only vector which normaly should don't have bacteria)
maybe it's the ligation which has bad done, we maybe have to increase incubation time.
All Manip
