Press Coverage
Instructor Meeting 22 April 2009
Action Points of the Meeting
Assign a student for each task. Review structure of meetings (Agenda/Action Points/Minutes) (Arun)
Start on modelling to decide on the construction of our genetic parts
Model the metal intake (James)
Model comK system (Jane)
Model sin operon (Goksel
Investigate if sigmaA is turned off during sporulation (Jess)
Calculate the cost of synthesizing a promoter library. This library will be constricted by changing the sequences between the consensus sequences and after them. By measuring the expression of fluorescent proteins we can characterize their PoPS generation (Arun)
Contact to Leendert Hamoel to register to the iGEM wiki (Mat)
Contact Nigel Robinson about metalisation (Mat)
Take pictures in the meetings (Hanny)
Minutes of the Meeting
Use sigmaA to express mntH.
We can characterize existing promoters
