Formal Lab Session - 9th October 2009
Introduction
Prepared our biobricks to send for sequencing. Measured the concentration of the midipreps for our work.
Diluted the primers for pSB1AT3
Digest yesterday's Mini prep results
Gel extraction for cotC PCR fragment after digestion, 4 sample's from Jen's promoter library experiment.
Conclusion
We checked the colonies on starch plate with iodine. We had successful transformation of pGFP-rrnB into B. subtilis however after the microscopy we realized that we did not have pMUTIN4 integrated into B. subtilis and we had to transform the colonies with pMUTIN4 for IPTG to work. So that LacI would be expressed in the cells.
We picked some colonies for kinA transformation growed on LB+Amp plate, after mini prep and digestion, the result of digestion told us that the colonies growed on LB+Amp plate are right colonies. Even they should not grow on LB+Amp plates.
