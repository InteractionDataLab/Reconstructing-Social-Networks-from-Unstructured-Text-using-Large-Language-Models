Minutes of the Meeting
Meeting started at 4.30pm
Discussed action points from last week- all were carried out with the exception of registration and design of wiki front page as registration does not seem to be open. These points are carried forward to next week
Went through each date on the timeline in detail
There will be 2 more students, which gives the opportunity of funding- Neil and Jen have been looking at funding and this is on track, any extra would be beneficial but not essential.
Discussed reuirements for Gold- Helping another team- this could be a new team or one we've helped before- Edinburgh
Improving a biobrick part- this requires labwork- look at which previous parts have not been characterised and try to fit them in to our project if possible this will save time and money. We could break down separate bits of funding, T-shirts, poster etc.
Discussed ideas and scored them for feasibility- Green /Amber/ Red...
