1.1 Agenda of the Meeting
1.2 Team Members in Meeting
1.3 Minutes of the Meeting
1.4 NEW Action Points For Next Meeting
11/03/2009 - iGEM Meeting
Agenda of the Meeting
Discuss previous meeting’s action points
Storyboard explaination of 3 ideas.
Generate the vote result, make the final project.
Ask about tutorial time.
Wiki presentation
Team Members in Meeting
Chair - Hanny
Minutes - Mathew R
Present - Neil, Craig, Mathew R, Arun, Jane, Jan-Willem Veening, Leendert Hamoen, James, Morgan, Goksel and Hanny
Apologies - Jen, Matthew, Jessica, Dan
Minutes of the Meeting
Brought new recruits and 2 new advisors up to date on the project details to date, i.e. introduced team members, talked about the shortlisted ideas, the competition itself, etc.
Reviewed last meeting’s action points
Correct the address details at IGEM web site – Done
Jess apply for funding – Application forms handed in
Arun apply for funding – Currently in Progress
Setup file upload permissions to the internal wiki – E-mail sent out round to iGem team members with username and password
Setup security to access to the internal wiki - E-mail sent out round to iGem team members with username and password
Populate internal wiki – Ongoing
iGem projects finalised next week – Currently in progress
Specify a date for tutorial – Must negotiate a date sometime next week
Every student should pick a simple BioBrick from the repository and try to understand what it does, which genes it uses etc - Ongoing
Add references to Wiki – Not fulfilled as yet but as we read papers, we need to place references on wiki
Setup laboratory notebook – Must prepare a laboratory notebook
Populate main wiki – Some work done; more work needed
Give some history to the new team members about ideas – E-mails sent to new iGem team members with summaries of ideas however the presentation of ideas today shall provide more information
Aim for awards – Ongoing
Watch top six presentations from last year’s iGem competition – Ongoing
Investigate previous iGem projects for similarities – Currently in progress but some team members have already found things
For each shortlisted idea, create 15 min storyboards – Done; presenting the storyboards in today’s meeting
Invite new team members – Done! They are present in today’s meeting
Bio Memory - Do a research on how to get the data into the bacteria and out again - Will be discussed today
Bio Memory - Is it possible to make coloured spores? – Will be discussed today
Sequester metals - Do a research on if it is ok to leave the spores in the environment after all - Will be discussed today
Sequester metals - Can termites be used to eat spores? – Will be discussed today
Storyboards explaining for ideas – Questions/challenges raised for each
1st Idea – Trapping Metals by Mathew R and Craig
Does Bacillus subtilis have a lot of space in periplasm?
Why 90% and 10%?
We don’t need to make a Biobrick for sporulation. B.subtilis already have sporulation mutants, therefore those mutants could be used for population growth.
How do we get the metal into the spore?
Where is the opportunity for modelling?
2nd Idea – Skin Repairer by Hanny and Jessica
Why do you need a GFP reporter? (Answer – to make itself known)
Does the production of these compounds (hyaluron synthase) require a cascade of enzymes?
Is there any data collected/research done on collagen and HS levels in Bacillus subtilis?
Do you know the threshold level of collagen for wound healing?
Are there any antibiotics involved here? What about Quorum Sensing Molecules?
Why don’t you just put a plaster in hyaluronic acid and stick it on the patient? (I.e. what advantages does this idea have?)
Don’t see many advantages here
3rd Idea – Bio Memory by Arun and Goksel
Has somebody already a similar idea to this one?
How much information can you store with a simple on/off signal in spores?
How are you going to store the bacteria in serial fashion?
This idea is very simple – where is the novelty?
Could you do something with concentrations of protein within a cell?
Can you integrate some of the first idea with this one, especially the sporulation signal idea?
The main issue is sequence! How do we get sequential order in bacteria?
Could we use the biosensor application featured here for detection purposes in the heavy metal idea?
These questions were posed by the presenters:
Can we have biostability inside spores without any DNA rearrangements?
Can we store colour-giving properties inside the outer layer of the spores?
Is it possible to control DNA rearrangement?
Vote Result
Not everybody has voted yet
However today’s meeting has showed that the first and third ideas can be amalgamated – everyone present was in favour of this suggestion. The idea – maybe use Bacillus subtilis to detect heavy metals in soil and then give a signal for them!
Wiki Tutorial/Presentation
Yet to arrange meeting with Morgan sometime next week however James has already done a short tutorial online which gets people familiar with the internal wiki. MediaWiki tutorial to come…
NEW Action Points For Next Meeting
Review the questions and challenges put forward for each idea
Do additional reading/research into ideas but more of an emphasis on the first and third ideas
Finalise an idea and write a paragraph on the idea to be posted in the main wiki
Reschedule wiki tutorial with Morgan.
