Reviewing last meeting's Action Points
Design biobricks and primers in Sequencher
Sequencha had been ordered and has arrived - BioBricks have been designed as have the primers needed to make them

Students to prepare primers and cloning strategy documents by tuesday
Done!
NEW ACTION POINT - Tidy up some of the cloning strategies
Make virtual construct of our manually constructed BioBricks on Clone Manager
Done
NEW ACTION POINT - Either put the constructs on the hard drive of the computer in Phil's office OR place them onto a shared network
Look at which enzymes we need in the lab and order them
Enzymes all ordered and present
Review the timeline and change it according to cloning strategy
