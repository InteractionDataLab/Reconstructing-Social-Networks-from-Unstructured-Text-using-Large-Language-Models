Internal Meeting 29 June 2009
Chair: Hanny
Students: James, Jane, Mathew, Goksel
Action Points of the Meeting
Assess action points from the last meetings and comment on progress
Discuss ideas and thoughts on the Edinburgh UK get-together
Raise any issues or questions.
Minutes of the Meeting
Assessment of Action Points
Model of Metal Intake
James has done some of the work but needs more help from biologists!
It was discussed that we first of all need to model cadmium only and THEN we can consider other metals - start from the basics.
Need to find out how much cadmium binds to the promoter/protein per second
Need to measure how much protein is expressed by promoter activation
Using this data, work out how much cadmium is taken in by the metallothionein
It was decided that the whole team (students) should meet up after lab sessions to work together on getting relevant data and get this model working.
We need TWO models - 1) A model for Bacillus subtilis response to cadmium in different scenarios and 2) A model for cadmium influx in B. subtilis
Model sinI operon
Goksel has made model based on a paper on stochastic switches without changing parameters.
Question: Should we leave the model sequence as it is?
Model comK sequence
Jane has done model based on given equations on paper
Not quite sure on the layout of the model (in diagram structure)
Can now study CellML
Promoter Library
Program and task carried out by Jen
Prioritise BioBricks
Ongoing process
Meeting up outside of lab hours to 'map' out project, decide on the BioBricks and design them (along with DNA sequences)
Need tutorial on Sequentia
Coding in J-Sim
Ongoing
Write up about Cadmium and the Environment
Information has been researched and written into paragraphs
Information could be re-written and tidied
Decide on Awards
Gold Award!
Our project fits into the Environmental project strand
Wiki, Presentation, Poster
Lab Space (Rotas)
Decided in meeting that because there is currently six of us, 2 groups of three will start off
These groups of three consist of one biologist and two non-biologists
Once others come back, may go into pairs
External Wiki photos to be uploaded
Goksel has uploaded some photographs of Newcastle onto internal wiki
CCS template issues on Firefox/Safari/Some versions of IE, etc
James has sorted the problem - it turned out to be more than a CSS issue. James changed the links from 'Wiki' links to HTML links and that has resolved the issue.
Jen to email the team photos
This has already been done - this photo was used in the presentation shown in Edinburgh
Do a new version of the timetable
Has been updated
Plan for a week off before coming back for next teaching year (September-ish), to relax before even more work
Didn't discuss
Edinburgh itinerary to be emailed to group
Completed
Create an informal talk/presentation for the Edinburgh trip, we will run through this either on the Thursday meeting, or on an extra Friday meeting - this should contain some, but not too much technical detail, eg genes.
Completed - presentation was given to participants of the iGem 2009 UK team get-together
Phil to be added to the mailing list
An administrator of the mailing list needs to do this if not done already
Thoughts and ideas from iGem UK get-together
Need to write up about ethics and social implications of project and synthetic biology
Awaiting e-mail from Edinburgh University regarding ideas and thoughts generated from the discussion activity
Need to write up a report of the Edinburgh trip
James has written a few paragraphs which has been posted onto the internal wiki
Add photos and presentation to the wiki
Ongoing
Any questions or concerns
Ask about MatLab
Ask about Sequentia tutorial
Ask about uploading information onto external wiki
