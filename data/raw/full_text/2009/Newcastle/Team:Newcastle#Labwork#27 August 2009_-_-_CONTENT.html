It was our first attempt in using this brand of enzymes, which should have only taken 5 minutes to digest. However the digests didn't work and this was done to a couple of reasons: a) there was too much DNA to digest and b) even the 10 minute digestion period was not long enough.
</P><P>In today's lab session the team will conduct a second attempt of the digests and hopefully analyse them by DNA gel electrophoresis today also. As well as this the team needs to begin acting on the cloning strategy for the cadmium-sensing AND gate (i.e. placing the <I>cadA</I> promoter region next to the <I>arsR</I> binding site) by excising the <I>BBa_J33206</I> + <I>pSB1A2</I> backbone (which will have it's original promoter removed) out of gel and purifying the fragment.

However this time round, the team took the decision to digest less DNA and to also allow the digests to run for about 1 hour under 37C incubation.

The digests were then left for an hour to ensure complete digestion. After this they were loaded in agarose gel and placed under DNA gel electrophoresis. The gel was analysed using the GelDoc system and the photograph produced can be seen under the <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Labwork/27_August_2009#Results" class="external text" rel="nofollow">'Results'</A> section.

This digest would then be run on gel with the backbone fragment excised and eventually cleaned up.
</P><P>The digest itself involved 10ul of <I>BBa_J33206</I> (in plasmid <I>pSB1A2</I>) DNA being cut with enzymes '<B> and '</B>. The total volume of the mixture was 40ul:

</LI><LI> 2ul of '
</LI><LI> 2ul of '
</LI><LI> 4 ul of Buffer solution
</LI><LI> 12ul of sterile distilled water
</LI></UL><P>1 hour was given for the digest to take place under 37C incubation in the water bath. After this period was over the 40ul of digest solution was then placed in 0.8% agarose gel and run for only 20 minutes under 60 volts - this is to ensure that the band doesn't run too far.
</P><P>When we took the gel to the dark room, the gel was exposed to UV light - this made the backbone fragment glow enabling us to cut it out correctly. The gel slice was then placed in an Eppendorf tube for gel extraction tomorrow.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Results">Results</SPAN></H3><P>
The image above immediately shows the digests have been successful this time - clear bands are present. When the plasmid is linearised twice (once by <I>EcoRI</I> and once by <I>PstI</I>) it can be seen that the bands produced are larger than the size anticipated for the linearised plasmids - the expected size is 3035bp and the band lies just below the 4361bp band produced by the <I>HindIII</I> ladder. This seems to be an erroneous result.
</P><P>However when both <I>EcoRI</I> and <I>PstI</I> are applied to the DNA the small fragment seems to be a lot shorter than the expected size - the team expects a 936bp fragment whereas the fragment produced rather resembles the 564bp fragment of the <I>HindIII</I> ladder. This is also erroneous!
</P><P>The reason for the DNA looking like this will be investigated further.

The gel was then taken to the dark room (where the gel analysis equipment is kept) and under UV light, the fluorescing band found at the top of the well was cut out of the gel. The fragment was then placed in an Eppendorf tube for the gel extraction process. Although the heavier band was taken for processing, it has to be said that we were unconvinced that the digestions had worked properly; the bands we had expected to see did not emerge and the probable reason for this the time these enzymes had to operate. The FastDigest enzymes had been used and despite the protocol suggesting these enzymes take 5 minutes to digest, the bands seemed to show otherwise.
</P><P>Meanwhile, the 8kb fragment of DNA was prepped using the gel extraction kit; the end solution was 50ul eluted plasmid DNA which is now stored in the -20C freezer.
