From 2009.igem.org
Internal Meeting 11 May 2009
Action Points of the Meeting
Set a date for Modelling Tutorial with Goksel.
Model of Metal Intake
Model of sinI Operon
Model of comK system -> someone to write a brief summary on the model(Hanny?)
Promotor library -> Write a program (Java)
Email N.J Robinson regarding building of model (??) (Mathew?)
Email GeneArt directly, asking for discounts (Arun?)
Email Dr. Aldridge regarding DNA shipment (?)
Germination (?)
Prioritise which bricks to synthesize, pull out individual bits (major, exciting parts that will earn medals) due to limited funds. Example: germination stochastic switch, metal sponge, etc.
Mathew to forward the email from N.J Robinson.
Reason why gene is selected
Hybrid promoter for sigma A
Coding (JSim) -> Generate CellML Model on a frontline (James?)
Write up on Cadmium and the environment
Decide which awards to aim for, using Matlab would not get a prize, need to use/rewrite models.
Lab space -> Need to take turns, therefore need to come up with a proper schedule
Minutes of the Meeting
iGEM get-together in Edinburgh 23-24th June (Monday-Tuesday) -> May need to postpone labwork as a result.
sin I operon -> do we really need it? sporulation..?
need pretty pictures of things changing -> criteria for prize.
sigmaA - want to express mnth all the time with sigma A
have 2 promoters infront of smta
make hyprid promotor -> try to model, can do a write up as an idea and put it up on the wiki
Promoter library - Want to build a promoter library with different strands and strengths, not single strands.
Need to alter some of the consensus
Write a program using Java
By looking at the levels derived from ... radiator, find the strength, rank cross no. experiments. Cannot compare the absolute no. microrate -> level of expression for each gene (amount of mRNA of each gene, measure intensity via a software).
