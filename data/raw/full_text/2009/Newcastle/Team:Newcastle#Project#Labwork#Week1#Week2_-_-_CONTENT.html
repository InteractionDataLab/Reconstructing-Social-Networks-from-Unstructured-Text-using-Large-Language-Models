We inserted the three BioBricks into competent <I>E.coli</I> cells grown in the previous lab session (via plasmids) and grew them overnight. The cells were spread on plates in both undiluted and diluted forms. The diluted solution of competent <I>E.coli</I> cells were spread onto three different plates - a negative control plate, a positive control plate and a plasmid plate (see table above). Today we reviewed the cultures which grew on the plates and prepared them for plasmid extraction and purification - this will form tomorrow's experiment.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Observations">Observations</SPAN></H4><P>Firstly, none of the <I>E.coli</I> cells mixed with BioBrick 1 (in the presence of competence inducers) took up the DNA - they didn't appear on the diluted or undiluted plates, which were lined with ampicillin. However the <I>E.coli</I> cells which had been mixed with BioBricks 2 and 3 did take up the DNA as they were present in colonies on ampicillin-covered plates. There were two colonies of bacteria which had been transformed by BioBrick 2, and eight colonies transformed by BioBrick 3. These 10 cultures became the focus of the subsequent experiments.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Preparation_of_Solutions">Preparation of Solutions</SPAN></H4><P>To prove that the DNA the <I>E.coli</I> cells had taken up really was the BioBrick added to the solution, we need to carry out the procedure of DNA electrophoresis with the aid of restriction enzymes. In order to carry out this step, we need to extract and purify the plasmids first (to be done tomorrow) via alkaline lysis - this requires three solutions, two of which were made today.
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Solution_1">Solution 1</SPAN></H5><P>According to Dr. Aldridge's protocol named &quot;Philâs mini method for Alkaline Lysis for Mini Prep&quot;, we need to add 'solution 1' (along with an RNAse) to resuspended transformed <I>E.coli</I> cells, tomorrow. Solution 1 requires the following ingredients at the following concentrations:
</P><PRE>   * 50 mM Glucose
   * 25 mM Tris.Hcl (pH 8.0)
   * 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) 
</PRE><P><B>This solution was made today in preparation for tomorrow's exercise.</B> We were told that the total volume should be 250ml. We were presented with pre-made solutions - 1M Tris HCl and 0.5M EDTA - and were told we needed to calculate the correct volumes of each of these solutions to be added to the beaker to give the desired molarity. 
</P><P>We were presented with glucose in it's solid form and asked to make a stock solution of 1M glucose; after which we were asked to calculate the amount to glucose solution to add to the beaker to make a molarity of 0.5M! The following equation helped:
</P><P>Molecular Weight    x    Desired Volume (Litres)   x   Molarity   =   Weight (grams)
</P><UL><LI><B>Making the glucose stock solution</B></LI><LI> molecular weight of glucose = 180.2
</LI><LI> desired volume of stock solution = 500ml
</LI><LI> desired molarity of stock = 1M
</LI></UL><P>Put these values into the equation above gives the amount of glucose solid needed for 500ml of water...
</P><P>180.2   x   0.5l   x   1M   =   90.1g
</P><P>We added to 90.1 grams of glucose to 0.5 litres to get a 1M stock solution.
</P><UL><LI><B>Adding the solutions to the beaker</B></LI><LI> 25ml of 1M glucose stock solution was transferred to beaker (to make 50mM)
</LI><LI> 6.25ml of 1M Tris.HCl was transferred to the same beaker (to make 25mM)
</LI><LI> 5ml of 0.5M EDTA also added (to make 10mM)
</LI><LI> H2O made the rest of the solution
</LI></UL><P><B> These values are derived from the above equation</B></P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Solution_3">Solution 3</SPAN></H5><P>We also needed to make solution 3 for tomorrow's practical. This involved the following ingredients:
</P><PRE>* 5M Potassium acetate: 60ml
   * glacial acetic acid: 11.5 ml
   * H2O: 28.5 ml 
</PRE><P>The glacial acetic acid and the water could be added to the 'Solution 3' beaker immediately, but calculations had to be carried out for the 5M potassium acetate to determine the mass of the solid. We decided to make a 200ml stock of 5M solution.
</P><UL><LI> The molecular weight of potassium acetate = 98.15
</LI><LI> The desired volume of this solution = 0.2 litres
</LI><LI> The desired molarity = 5M
</LI></UL><P>
Put this into the equation:

Molecular Weight x Desired Volume (Litres) x Molarity = Weight (grams)
</P><PRE>    98.15       x        0.2l      x   5M    = 98.15 grams
</PRE><P>
We then made up the solution and added it to the other ingredients, according to the protocol.

However the Eppendorf tubes that are placed into the centrifuge dont't have that capacity. So we pipetted 1.5ml of the 10 cultures into 10 Eppendorf tubes, spun them, removed the supernatant and added a further 1.5ml of the cultures to the 10 tubes. This was spun and the supernatant removed.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> The 10 pellets were then each resuspended in 300 microlitres of Solution I. Prior to this, we added 150 microlitres of RNAse A to the bottle containing our premade Solution I.

The tubes containing the pellets were then discarded.

With these micro-organisms, we were able to induce competence and had the opportunity to transform them with the following BioBricks:
</P><UL><LI><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J04450" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J04450</A> with plasmid pSB1AK3

</LI></UL><P>
So far, we are convinced that 2 colonies of our cultured <I>E.coli</I> cells have become transformed by BioBrick BBa_I13522 (with plasmid pSB1AK3) which encodes GFP and that 10 colonies of our cultured <I>E.coli</I> cells have been transformed by BioBrick BBa_J04450 (with plasmid pSB1AT3), which leads to the production of RFP. This can be seen visually in the tubes; see image in the previous experiment under the heading '<A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Project/Labwork/Week1#Observations_2" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Observations</A>'. 
</P><P>However visual representations may not always available and in these scenarios, it is difficult to tell whether the <I>E.coli</I> have become transformed by the given BioBrick unless DNA analysis is conducted. Even though the cells have survived the negative selection process (i.e. antibiotic exposure), it doesn't mean that they all possess the BioBrick - they could have received that resistance through other means.

Thus we won't be proving that it is the BioBrick which is causing the bacteria to display the properties seen so far. We will be proving that the bacteria have taken up plasmids.

</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Observations_and_Results">Observations and Results</SPAN></H4><UL><LI> Once 40 minutes had expired, electrodes were switched off and lid removed. In the gel it could be seen that the DNA had streaked from the wells to the positive electrode. Three marker bands were visible, in order from nearest wells to nearest positive electrode - a cyan band, a dark blue band and a yellow band.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> Gel removed from gel tray and taken to UV scanner. The following photograph was produced:
</LI></UL><P>
From this photograph it can be seen that apart from the <I>E.coli</I> cells located in colony 9, all the colonies that had survived the negative selection and displayed either a red or a green colour in solution contained plasmid DNA. This proves that most of the colonies had been transformed with a plasmid at least. The possibilities for colony 9 not revealing a plasmid DNA readout are as follows:
</P><UL><LI> Colony 9 <I>E.coli</I> cells did not receive the plasmid DNA and acquired it's ampicillin resistance and colour properties elsewhere
</LI><LI> The plasmid DNA (which appears as a transparent pellet in the previous experiment) was lost when the supernatant was tipped out.
</LI></UL><P>
Now that Team:Newcastle has proved that the competent <I>E.coli</I> cells have taken up the plasmids, the next step will be to prove that the 'E.coli' have taken up the specific BioBricks that we attempted to transform them with. This will involve restriction enzymes and another DNA gel electrophoresis.

</P><P>The next step is to show that these plasmids contain the BioBricks we intended to transform the bacteria with. This can be done by using restriction enzymes followed by DNA gel electrophoresis. Each standard BioBrick is flanked with restriction sites, which are the target of restriction enzymes.
