Introductory Lab Session: 15th July 2009
Experiment Recap
Two agar plates containing the 10 original cultures of transformed E.coli. Today's procedure will see the cultures in divisions labelled '2' and '3' cultured for a large plasmid prep
In the previous experiment, we had carried out DNA gel electrophoresis on six plasmids from our transformed E.coli cells - the six plasmids were each divided into two sets with the first set of six being treated with EcoRI alone and the second set being treated with EcoRI and PstI:
First set - treated with EcoRI
Culture 2 (GFP) - Lane 3
Culture 3 (RFP) - Lane 4
Culture 4 (RFP) - Lane 5
Culture 5 (RFP) - Lane 6
Culture 6 (RFP) - Lane 7
Culture 7 (RFP) - Lane 8
Second set - treated with EcoRI and PstI
Culture 2 (GFP) - Lane 9
Culture 3 (RFP) - Lane 10
Culture 4 (RFP) - Lane 11
Culture 5 (RFP) - Lane 12
Culture 6 (RFP) - Lane 13
Culture 7 (RFP) - Lane 14
After analysis of the gel photographs and comparison with the expected band sizes for the plasmids, plasmid backbones and BioBricks, we decided that cultures 2(GFP) and 3(RFP) were to be used for a larger scale plasmid prep.
To 2 tubes of sterile LB nutrient broth, a sample of cultures 2 and 3 were introduced. They were then placed into the shaking incubator overnight.
Introduction
Today's procedure is straightforward. Using aseptic technique, we are to innoculate 2 flasks containing LB nutrient broth with the 2 cultures grown overnight. Once carried out, these flasks will be incubated overnight and used in tomorrow's larger scale plasmid prep.
Procedure
Mathew pipetting 50ml LB into a flask
Prepare 2 sterile flasks and to each of them, add 50ml of sterile LB.
Remember to use aseptic technique throughout, i.e. flame the lids of the flask and the LB bottle with a Bunsen burner before and after transferring liquids
Label the flasks appropriately. To one flask, pipette 100 microlitres of the first culture and to the second flask, pipette 100 microlitres of the second culture. (In this case, they are cultures 2 and 3 - GFP and RFP transformed E.coli respectively)
Place flasks in shaking incubator. To ensure that the right amount of cells grow in the media for the plasmid prep, the incubation period should be limited to 16 hours.
