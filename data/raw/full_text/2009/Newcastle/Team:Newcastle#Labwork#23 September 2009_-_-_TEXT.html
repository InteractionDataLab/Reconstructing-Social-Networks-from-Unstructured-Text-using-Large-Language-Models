Formal Lab Session - 23rd September 2009
Overview
Stochastic Switch Team -
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team -
Stochastic Switch Team
Today we discovered that the transfrormations seemed sucessful, and the control plates had no growth at all which is what was hoped for. Hopefuly this means that we have a transformed ara-sspb-pSB1AT3 ligation product.
We set up miniprep cultures for 12 colonies using LB + amp + tet
We also set up 12 more miniprep cultures for the Sac transformed cells in hope that the precious minipreps had been carried out incorrectly.
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
Introduction
Today's main work is to ligate kinA with pGFP-rrnB vector and transform ligated vector into E.coli.
Experiment procedure
ligate kinA and pGFP-rrnB
ligate reaction
dd H2O                                 14.5ul  Fast ligation buffer                      4ul  pGFP-rrnB backbone(180ng/ul)            0.5ul  kinA fragment(6.1ng/ul)                  15ul  T4 ligase                                 1ul  ---------------------------------------------                                           35ul
Votex for few seconds.
22C 10min and 1 hour in RT.
Digest pMK-RQ:kinA and pGFP-rrnB
pMK-RQ digest reaction.
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     7ul  Fast EcoRI                 3ul  Fast NheI                  3ul  pMK-RQ vector             50ul  ------------------------------                            70ul
pGFP-rrnB digest reaction.
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     7ul  Fast EcoRI                 3ul  Fast NheI                  3ul  pGFP-rrnB vector          50ul  ------------------------------                            70ul
Incubate 1 hour at 37 degree.
Purify the digest fragment and backbone
Run the digested DNA on big well agarose gel.
cut the right bands.
Use gel extraction kit to purify the DNA fragments.
Transformation
Followed the Phil's transformation protocal.
Make LB+Spectinomycin plates
The spectinomycin solution in frige is 20mg/ml
The concentration needed in plate is 50ug/ml
Add 2.5ml spectinomycin solution into 1 liter LB agar medium and pour the plate

Further plan
If th transformation was success, we need to prepare the Mini and Midi culture.
Collect the plasmid with kinA and do transformation for B.subtilis.
