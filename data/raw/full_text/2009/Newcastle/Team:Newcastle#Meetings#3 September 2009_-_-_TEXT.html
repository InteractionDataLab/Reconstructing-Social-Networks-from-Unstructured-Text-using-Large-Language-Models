Agenda
Review last week's action points
Lab summary
Questions
Next week's lab plan
Action Points during last meeting
Need some sequencing primers for each BioBrick
Tidy up some of the cloning strategies
Either put the virtual constructs on the hard drive of the computer in Phil's office OR place them onto a shared network
Need to review timeline
Each team needs to come up with a five minute summary of their sub-project
Ask Nigel Robinson's advice on how to help Cornell
E-mail UQ University and enquire about helping them with modelling
Negotiate swap with Cornell and enquire about modelling
Follow up Groningen's e-mail
T-shirts designs
Integration Vector?
Promoter library?
Minutes
Reviewing last meeting's Action Points
Need some sequencing primers for each BioBrick
Tidy up some of the cloning strategies
Put current versions on the wiki, even if they are not finished; just to have them in one place.
Either put the virtual constructs on the hard drive of the computer in Phil's office OR place them onto a shared network
use Dropbox (getdropbox.com)
Need to review timeline
Students to ammend timeline.
Team members
Hanny has returned, after handing in her work.
Jane has left for a period of one month.
Jen has returned.
Each team came up with a five minute summary of their sub-project, James, Mat and Jess
5 Minute kit has arrived.
Some of the PCRs are not working.
Use a different Taq.
Redesign primers, maybe bigger and without cut sites (2 days).
Use less genomic DNA.
More ethanol is needed (Chris is to be reminded next wednesday).
Only small gloves are currently available in the lab - we are to order some.
Ask Nigel Robinson about working with Cadmium, and an electromicroscope.
Ask Nigel Robinson's advice on how to help Cornell
Mat emailing him; he has indirectly assisted Groningen.
E-mail UQ University and enquire about helping them with modelling
Mat to email.
Modellers are to meet to discuss and work.
Negotiate swap with Cornell and enquire about modelling
Mat to email?

Follow up Groningen's e-mail
Mat to email?
T-shirts designs
Numbers of shits - 11 are going to Jamboree, plus other members, backups, etc.
Personalise some of the shirts - make name or initials look like plasmid ID.
Purple is a possible colour.
Design needed soon.
Poster
Can be no larger than A0 (1.2m2)
Look at possible design layouts.
Must be sent for printing 2 weeks before Jamboree.
Presentation
Mock presentations are to be given to:
The Bioinformatics research group on a Friday morning in late October.
Noel's student group in Sunderland.
Prestenation should be around 20 mins; in a 30 min time slot.
10-20 slides.
Come up with our content, before designing slides
Use Camtasia to record models, etc.
Some parts are to be simplified (eg. gene names), more tech parts to be kept (eg. equations).
Try to focus on the Biology, not the 'experience'.
Integration Vector?
Promoter library?
Mat is working under Neil and Jen's supervision on this in the lab; cloning into pgfp, etc.
Sequence the AND gate?
Needed for Tuesday.
Boston
Research ESTA for USA trip.
Neil to send out full details of flights and hotels.
Noel's microscope in Sunderland.
Goksel to be trained.
Lab rota
New rota to be devised.
Current 'free-for-all' cannot continue.
Teams are to take time out of lab to work on t-shirts, posters, modelling, etc.
Labwork
Lab work is to continue at fast pace.
Shared labbooks are to remain in the lab.
Gel UV images are to be placed in Dropbox.
Print out photos of gels, etc, and stick into lab books.
Use the lab scanner for copying lab book content for wiki.
Neil to send off Plasmids.
Various PCR primers and enzymes have arrived.
