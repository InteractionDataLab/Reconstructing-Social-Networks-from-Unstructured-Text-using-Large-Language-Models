Formal Lab Session - 14th October 2009
This morning we check yesterday's transformation result, it turned out we got transformed cell for all three strains.
we patched the colonies on LB+EM+CHL+Starch plate to check whether the pGFP-rrnB:kinA part were integrated in amyE part or not.
After 6 hours grow on antibiotic and starch plate, we got some right colonies.
Microscopy Test to characterize KinA
We inoculated 6 cultures for the microscopy test from haloless colonies since tehy were transformed with our biobrick. We inoculated them into MM competence medium overnight
Colony 1 from BFS2426 transformation
Colony 18 from BFS2426 transformation
Colony 13 from BFS40 transformation
Colony 18 from BFS240 transformation
Colony 19 from BFS867 transformation
Colony 22 from BFS867 transformation
Colony 5 from BFS2426 with halo. (As a negative control)
No cell (Control)
Transformations
We did transformations from midipreps to have stock for our biobricks. We will freeze them later. We transformed ara, sac, ara+sspB Biobricks.
