IGEM Meeting 14 May 2009
Attendees: Neil Wipat, Hennifer Hallinan, Goksel Misirli, Hang Zhao, Daniel Swan
Action Points
Build a promoter library, use ClustalW for the alignment
Use microaray data to rank teh promoters based on their strenghths
Check if sigmaA is turned off during sporulation
Another approach for the stochastic swicth is using DNA flipping. Based on random DNA flipping we will have RFP wexpression or activated gerM expression. The promoter between the flipping region is turned to activate the right or the left side
[rfp RBS&CDS] - [lac promoter] - [invertase protein RBS&CDS] - [lac RBS&CDS] - [flipping region] - [promoter] - [flipping region] - [gerM RBS&CDS] - [gfp RBS&CDS]
stochastic switch gere would be :
[lac promoter] - [invertase protein RBS&CDS] - [lac RBS&CDS] - [flipping region] - [promoter] - [flipping region]
