23/03/2009 - iGEM Meeting
Agenda of the Meeting
Review our project in mind (on the 18/03/09 meeting, question was posted on the objective of 3rd idea to be used together with the 1st idea).
Decide on our project's title.
Post our idea on the external wiki.
Need to list all the BioBricks needed for modelling.
Develop software systems which stimulates the system.
Minutes of the Meeting
Discussed names, began thinking of 'sponges', but then decided on a parody of the Atari videogame character "Pac Mac", "Bac Man", as suggested by Goksel initially and extended by Craig, to an Eco-warrior called Sir Bac-man..
We reviewed the opening paragraph, and welcome blurb for the iGem wiki; Craig volenteered to write a draft.
Discussed various scenerios for Biobrick design, splitting the project into its parts.
Sense metals for Memory.
Getting Cd into cell.
Keep it in the cell.
Pump it into the spore (while forming).
Sense environment and sporulate.
Stochastic switch.
Created various diagrams for these ideas.
From these scenerios, we decided to assign each person some reading:
Matt - sensing cadmium (CzrA, CueR, ArsR).
Craig - cadA efflux system.
Hanny -  smta.
Jane - how to trigger sporulation.
Goksel - stochastic switches.
Arun - DNA re-arrangement.
James - how to keep Cd in the cell.
Jess -  how to pump Cd to spore.
All - how to use Zinc as a backup.
Wednesday 25 March 13:00 CLT601 - Discussed research and decided to email questions.
Next iGem formal meeting - Thursday 26 March 16:00 CLT922.
Agenda of the Meeting (26/03/09)
present the paragraph summary for the external wiki
students to present parts they researched on
overview of the process
present Biobricks and development
Action Points of the Meeting (26/03/09)
10% sporulate or 10% continue as vegetative cells
set a date for BioBrick tutorial
Minutes of the Meeting (26/03/09)
Advisors present: Neil, Dan, Morgan, Nigel
Students absent: Arun
Jane was chairing the meeting, and discussed the Action Points from the last meeting.
We reviewed Craig’s introduction for the iGem website. There is only one minor correction to be made; software modeller to software engineer. Advisors liked the Bac-Man idea.
90/10% is for modelling to decide. Second Stochastic switch is to be used during pre-spore.
Individual research
Jess
Cerevicie (sp?), Crs5 – zinc, cadmium.
How they are regulated CupA/smtA (preferred).
How much metal? (Dan) - 7 (4/3) human (Nigel), 4 on smtA, 54 amino acids.
Spore wall – advisors have same concern.
Timing may be a solution, using an early sigma factor, metallothiane linked to early sf.
Yugx/yugw operon not cadA (Nigel’s 2006 paper).
Look for y knocked out mutations.
Health and Safety concerns of using Cadmium, ask University’s permission.
Goskel
How to tune balance of SinI – different strength promoters – weak before P3
Could use Jen’s model for this, or use Equations to create a model.
DNA Salmonella phase
Drain/thrive population – model
Enhance population where there is Cadmium?
Hanny
SmtA instead of CupA
(Nigel) BNA has made cd for SmtA/B
12 m molar to 2 m molar
Microbe TB hidden in genome
Not in Database yet - MyaT
Matt – Sensing
Metallothianine production after first stochastic switch.
Fur targets just (cobalt?)
Ditch cueR, just use two.
Use Zinc as backup?
AND gate may be in repository
Cadmium specific Zur
DNA rearrange – biobrick? - smtA, ArsR, CzrA
sigA promote 2 binding sites, neuclotide
AP swich off CadA intro into prowel trigger sporlation.
Replace CadA?
7 Cd, 64 amino acids
CzcD not for Bacillus Subtillus (CadA)
How does Cd get into the cell?
No normal Cd uptake
mntH manages unspc
Sneaks through
Mutate?
Cry - Bacillus Thongenese - Spore crystal protein - Insects do not eat
Action Points of the Meeting
Create a Flowchart (big with genes)
Develop software systems which stimulates the system
10% sporulate or 10% continue as vegetative cells - Modelling
Familiarise self with BioBricks, website to go: www.partsregistry.org - ALL
List all the BioBricks needed
Organise a Biobrick tutorial with Anil for a week on Thursday?
Use software such as X-Mind for collaborative ideas
Post paragraph, and maybe wiki-design on main wiki
