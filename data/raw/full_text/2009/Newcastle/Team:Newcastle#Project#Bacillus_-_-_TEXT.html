Press Coverage
Bacillus subtilis
Bacillus subtilis strain 168 is the bacterial species of choice for the 2009 Newcastle team. It is a Gram-positive, catalase-positive bacterium commonly found in soil. Some of our instructors and advisers, including Anil Wipat, know a great deal about B. subtilis and have worked with it in the past.
The 2008 iGEM Newcastle team and a number of other 2008 also used B. subtilis and provide a nice overview of its advantages in their wiki . Thanks to the efforts of these teams the number of B. subtilis parts in the registry is increasing. This year we have added many more.
