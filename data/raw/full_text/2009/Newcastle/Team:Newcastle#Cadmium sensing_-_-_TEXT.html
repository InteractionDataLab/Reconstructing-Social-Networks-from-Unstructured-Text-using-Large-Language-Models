Press Coverage
Cadmium Sensing
The metal sensing proteins we intend to use are yozA (czrA) and arsR which both bind cadmium as well as zinc cobalt and nickle, and arsenic, silver and copper respectively.These proteins are repressor proteins which also bind DNA preventing transcription of downstream CDS. The repressor proteins however release the DNA to preferentially bind cadmium allowing transcription to occur. These proteins therefore allow selective sensing of cadmium in the form of an AND gate, a model for which can be seen in our modelling section.
