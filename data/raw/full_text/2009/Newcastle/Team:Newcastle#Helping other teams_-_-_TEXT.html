Helping Another iGEM Team
Team:Newcastle have helped other iGEM teams. The first completed instance of assisting another team was with Team:UQ-Australia .
UQ-Australia
Team:Newcastle helped UQ-Australia with their modelling. UQ-Australia had previously been focusing on the Wet Lab Biology of their project, which is Bioprecipitation and Biofiltration. The model files which were written in the Matlab software environment are based on their Mercury Vacuum Project.
We prepared the model to sense Mercury and run the simulations with a quick tutorial on modelling.
Files
We sent UQ-Australia the following files.
