Questions
Last Week's Action Points
Ask to Collin Hardwood's lab for pMutin4 primers
Design sequencing primers for gfp-rrnb
Contact to Nigel Robinson to use his lab and the electromicroscope
Citate the papers in the wiki for metal sensing. Quote short sentences where necessary.
Write an email to Pete Lee at the end of our presentation
Design the tshirts and send the designs to the printing company.
Integration vector needs to be finished
Register to ESTA
Make a request for variance for gfp-rrnb and Genarts' plasmid. Send their genbank files to iGEM and ask if we can use them. GenArt is already an iGEM sponsor and it should be reasonable to accept it. When asking about this permission make sure we say we have biobrick prefixes and suffixes anyway. Ask for the list of approved vectors. Done.
Copy the genbank files of the plasmids to Dropbox. Done?
Send an email for Track selection selecting three of them in order of preference. So the list will be Environment, Information Processing,... Done.
Write the abstract and send it to instructors before next Tuesday. Do not use more than what is asked(150 words?) State the problem we are tackling and our approach. Done.
Team roster is due on 18th Sep. Done.
Remind to Neil and Jen to finalize the team rosters. Done.
Finish everything until October 15th, send the biobricks, enter all the information
Learn who can enter the parts on the registry. Does it have to be instructors? (Goksel)
