Formal Lab Session - 29th September 2009
Today we did miniprep for the ten ON cultures. Run them on thel gel.
After the results we did a restriction digest with HindIII and BamHI to find out the right colony.
However we did not get good results and we could not find the right colony we were looking for.

Introduction
Two transformations need to be done today, one for psc-pMutin4 and another for kinA-pGFP-rrnB
Experiment procedure

Digest the Mini Prep result for smtA:pMutin4 transformation
This transformation was carried out by Matt and Arun.
HindIII and BamHI were used for digestion.
