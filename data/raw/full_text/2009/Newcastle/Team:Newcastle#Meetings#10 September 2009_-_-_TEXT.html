Questions
Action Points during last meeting
Need some sequencing primers for each BioBrick
Tidy up some of the cloning strategies
P place them onto a shared network
Need to review timeline
Ask Nigel Robinson's advice on how to help Cornell
Send UQ University a model
Negotiate swap with Cornell and enquire about modelling
Follow up Groningen's e-mail
T-shirts designs, get quotes
Numbers and Sizes!
Integration Vector?
Promoter library?
Neil to send off Plasmids.
Use a different Taq.
Redesign primers, maybe bigger and without cut sites (2 days).
More ethanol is needed (Chris is to be reminded ON wednesday).
Only small gloves are currently available in the lab - we are to order some.
Ask Nigel Robinson about working with Cadmium, and an electromicroscope.
Research ESTA for USA trip.
Neil to send out full details of flights and hotels.
Noel's microscope in Sunderland - Goksel to be trained.
Create new lab rotas and schedule lab work, so that we finish on time
Septemer  18/ October
Minutes
11 people will be going to MIT
New TAQ worked
New gloves, heating blocks and trays are ordered
New Action Points
Ask to Collin Hardwood's lab for pMutin4 primers
Design sequencing primers for gfp-rrnb
Contact to Nigel Robinson to use his lab and the electromicroscope
Citate the papers in the wiki for metal sensing. Quote short sentences where necessary.
Write an email to Pete Lee at the end of our presentation
Design the tshirts and send the designs to teh printing company. Do we personalize them?
Integration vector needs to be finished
Register to ESTA
Send the flight information (Neil)
Send an email to Noel to use microscope.
Make a request for variance for gfp-rrnb and Genarts' plasmid. Send their genbank files to iGEM and ask if we can use them. GenArt is already an iGEM sponsor and it should be reasonable to accept it. When asking about this permission make sure we say we have biobrick prefixes and suffixes anyway. Ask for the list of approved vectors.
Copy the genbank files of the plasmids to Dropbox
Send an email for Track selection selecting three of them in order of preference. So the list will be Environment, Information Processing,... (It is due on 18th Sep) (What was the 3rd one? Is Information Processing second or third?)
Write the abstract and send it to instructors before next Tuesday. Do not use more than what is asked(150 words?) State the problem we are tackling and our approach.
Team roster is due on 18th Sep
Remind to Neil and Jen to finalize the team rosters
Finish everything until October 15th, send the biobricks, enter all the information
Learn who can enter the parts on the registry. Does it have to be instructors? (Goksel)
Minutes
11 people will be going to MIT
New TAQ worked
New gloves, heating blocks and trays are ordered
