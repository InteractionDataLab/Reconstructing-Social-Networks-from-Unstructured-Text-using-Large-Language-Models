Instructor Meeting 16 April 2009
Students: Jess, James, Hanny, Goksel Instructors:
Apologies: Craig, Matt, Jane, Arun
Agenda of the Meeting
More about flowchart/table/modelling
iGEM wiki changes
Europe Workshop: Most likely May 30/31 in London, UK at Imperial College.
Lethbridge - Bacteria over Batteries - bacterial battery that uses photosynthesis to generate electricity.
EPF-Lausanne - Brainstorm of 10 ideas.
Action Points of the Meeting
Need to show normal growth on diagram
Model population dynamics
Ask Nigel Robinson about Metallisation
Make powerpoint more detailed (biobrick slides)
Name promoters that we are going to use
Put them in the right order
Finding a homologue comK
Minutes of the Meeting
Knock out comK, and replace with one from another organism
Sigma D Motility, provides bi-stability
Work in a mutant background for biofilm formation, if we use sinI/sinR stochastic switch. Knocking out biofilm 'genes'
Use KinA
Methylase, no GFP. Instead of DNA rearrangement?
RNAs Restriction enzyme, instead of DNAase to prevent germination, but don't know how it will work
recA mutants, can repair themselves
Metallothiene incorporate with whole set of coat proteins of the spore
GFP and RFP with smtA to see where it binds on the coat of the spore
Knock out phosphotases rap. spo0E sporelation
Natural switches instead of synthetic ones
Streptococci Stochastisity Competence
Sigma F (spore specific) to control DNA rearrangement
Negative feedback to control smtA expression
Control mntH using mntR, also controls mntABCD, lets in Fe
Strong promoters - Sigma K, cotC, cotA - can be used for smtA expression
Sigma D is expressed all the time, provides bi-stability
May be able to use E-Coli biobricks for DNA rearrangement
