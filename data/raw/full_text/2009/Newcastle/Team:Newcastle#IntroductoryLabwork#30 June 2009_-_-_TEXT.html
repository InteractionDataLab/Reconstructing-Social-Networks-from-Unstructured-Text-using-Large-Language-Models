Press Coverage
Introductory Lab Session: 30th June 2009
Our first introductory lab session saw members of the team make preparations to produce some competent DH5-alpha E. coli cells, which will be needed for the numerous transformations that will take place in the near future. The team started by following the first 'Pre-Culture' step in the protocol given to us by Dr. Phil Aldridge and then proceded to make up solutions needed for future steps in this procedure.
Carrying out the first 'Pre-culture' Step
We got samples of E.coli DH5-alpha strains and plated them into three agar plates. They were placed for incubation at 37°C
Preparing other solutions
Change to protocol - we have made up Glycerol solution with a concentration of 50% instead of 100%
We have created 0.1M of CaCl2 using 5.5 gram of CaCl2. The final solution is 0.5 litres. We placed them into 4 bottles (three 100ml and one 200ml). They have blue covers. We have left them for autoclaving.
We prepared LB solution using 20 grams of LB and water making up a final volume of 1 litre. We put them into bottles and left them for autoclaving.
