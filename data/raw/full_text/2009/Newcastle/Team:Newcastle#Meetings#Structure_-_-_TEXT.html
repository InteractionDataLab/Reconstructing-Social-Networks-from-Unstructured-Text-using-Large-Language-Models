1.2 General Meetings
1.3 Order for the meeting CHAIR and MINUTE TAKERS
Struture of Internal and General Meetings
Internal Meetings
Chair : The person who took minutes at the previous General meeting is the chair of the internal meeting. After the internal meeting, the chair sets the Agenda for the next General Meeting.
Minutes : The person who is going to be the minutes taker at the next General meeting takes the minutes. Minutes are added to the wiki as soon as possible after the meeting and an e-mail is sent to inform everyone of the update.
Date and time: The date and time of the internal meeting is decided after the previous General meeting. The chair then sends an e-mail with the date and time details as soon as possible so those who couldn't make it to the meeting are informed.
Venue: The venue is then sent by e-mail by the person who books the room.
Absence : Please send an e-mail to igem2009@ncl.ac.uk if you can't make it to the meeting.
Absence of the chair or minute taker: If the chair or minute taker is absent, the person who is next in the order list replace that person's position.
General Meetings
Chair : The person who chaired that week's internal meeting is the chair.
Minutes : The person who took the minutes at the internal meeting is the minute taker. Minutes are added to the wiki as soon as possible after the meeting and an e-mail is sent to inform everyone of the update.
Date and time: The date and time of the General meeting is decided at the end or during the General meeting. The chair then sends an e-mail with the date and time details as soon as possible so those who couldn't make it to the meeting are informed.

Absence : Please send an e-mail to igem2009@ncl.ac.uk if you can't make it to the meeting
