Formal Lab Session - 24th September 2009

Metal Sensor Team
To Do list
PCR clean up of cotC PCR done on the 23/09/09
Digest PCR clean up and also digest pMUTIN4 with BamHI and HindIII
PCR clean up both of these products
Run all of both sample on gel and excise bands
Extract bands from gel using GenElute's Gel Extraction kit
Set up overnight ligations of pMUTIN4 and cotC-GFP-smtA BioBrick
Stochastic Switch Team
Today we did minipreps of the ara/sspb/pSB1AT3 cultures which were then digested with EcoRI and SpeI. These were run on an 0.8% gel. We expected to see a ~600bp band as well as the plasmid backbone and the gel photograph seemed fairly convincing:
We set up a 50ml midiprep culture from the culture corresponding to lane 9 which seemed to have the clearest band.
Sporulation Tuning/Chassis Team
Introduction
We prepared kinA and pGFP-rrnB digested fragments yesterday, we'll carry on the next step as gel extraction and ligation and transformation.
For the double clone part, we need to ligate it to pMutin4 vector.
Experiment procedure
Gel extraction
Follow the standard procedure of Gel Extraction Kit(Sigma).
Ligation
Ligate kinA to pGFP-rrnB
Ligate digested PCR clean-up psc fragment to pMutin4
this psc fragment refer to the cwlJ:sleB fragment with HindIII and BamHI restriction sites at the end of each side.

-4C frige overnight.
Prepare the culture for Mini Prep
Since we got colonies from yesterday's transformation, we need to culture the colonies for mini prep.
Prepare smm medium
The protocal of making smm medium is come from our lab's B.subtilis 168 transformation protocal.
Conclusion
After the autoclave of smm medium, the medium got cloudy. It may has something wrong with the ingredients.
