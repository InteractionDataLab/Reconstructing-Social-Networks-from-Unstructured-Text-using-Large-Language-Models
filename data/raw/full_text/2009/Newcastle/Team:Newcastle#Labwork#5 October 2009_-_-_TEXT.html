Formal Lab Session - 5th October 2009
Transformations for the ligated product of cotC + pmutin4 and psc +pmutin 4 did not work. Propably pmutin4 was not cut properly with BamhI and HindIII.
We planned the transformation for B. subtilis for tomorrow.
We ordered T4 DNA ligase and NheI fast digest enzymes.
