Action Points
We want to find an answer to whether SigmaA is expressedin late sporulation stages. To find the answer we need to use microarray datasets specific for sporulation.
Assign PoPS for different SigmaA promoter using the microarray data. Hence we will have different sigmaA promoterw with different strength. It is difficult to say the promoter strength from a DNA sequence  but microarray data can be used to assign relative PoPS then this criteria can be used to rank the promoters based on their strenghts.
Build a promoter libray by changing the flanking sites, by changing the consensus sequences
Add a column to the microarray data and display which sequences of sigmaA is being used.
Take the alignment and order from the strongest to the weakest
Use microarray data to define the consensus sequence for sigmaA
Survey of DNA synthesis.
