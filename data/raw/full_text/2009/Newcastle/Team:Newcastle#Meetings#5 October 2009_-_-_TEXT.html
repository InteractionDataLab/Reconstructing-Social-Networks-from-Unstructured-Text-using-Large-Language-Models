T-shirts
Perfect Printware think that our design (the draft that they have) is virtually impossible to print.
We could get them to do a simpler version for more money (£20+ on white shirts).
The purple is causing problems.
We could change supplier.
Spectrum Imaging have said that they cannot do it for us.
We need to prepare to do it ourselves (print+iron).
A late design decision to go from '09 to just 09.
Poster
Jess has created a draft poster design which uses Mat's diagram as a central focus to split the poster into sections about each sub-project.
Could do a 'stochastic wheel' game.
By Friday, each group is to answer:
What the sub-project is.
Where it fits into the project.
Novelty factor.
Project modelling.
Labwork
Hanny has been working on transforming kinA, right size, but can't get into pgfp-rrnb.
The kinA biobrick as arrived in pgfp-rrnb.
CotC ligated into pMutin4 - Goksel will screen colonies and midi-prep.
Presentation
Put credits at the end.
1. Title.
2. Overview, aim, design - introduce project.
3. onwards Sub-proejct overviews, etc.
All sections more detail.
Popmod pages - introduce Grid and reasons.
Modelling
SBML and CellML models which are not finished, are to be finished!
Population model to be finished.
Need to find how to integrate as many of the models into the population simulation as possible
Could use/affect amounts of nutrients/cadmium, change the rates of import and export, change the chance of sequestering, sporulating and germinating.
