SBML
SBML is a language which stores and exchanges computer-based mathematical models. It is an open standard based on the XML markup language. For writing the models in SBML we used the COPASI program.
JSim
To bridge the gap between agent based models (Java) and cellular models (SBML), the Newcastle team are using a software product called JSim, developed by the University of Washington.
Models developed
The following are models which we have developed using SBML:
