Formal Lab Session - 1st October 2009
Restriction digest tests
Our previous transformations did not work well. We tested if we had the right pmutin4 and cotC biobricks.
We run them on the gel.
pmutin4:
4ul DNA 5ul Water 1ul loading buffer
CotC:
3ul of DNA 6ul DNA 1ul loading buffer
The bands were right. However some BamHI and HindIII sites on pMUTIN4 are too close, the backbone may not have been cut properly.
Preparation of competent cells
We prepared fresh DH5 alpha cells by plating them into two new LB plates
We also prepared a set of new E.coli DH5 alpha competent cells. we measured the ODs of E. coli cells during transformation. We waited 2 hours before measrung the ODs and we get the absorbance result as 0.146.  To measure the ODs
Set the device to 600nM Place a tube with LB only and take a reference measurement Place the culture and press the green box.
We then tested our competent cells for transformation. We used 40ul of cells + 3ul DNA for the tests. We used pmutin4 and pSB1AT3 for the tests
Ligations
We prepared ligations for Cot +  pmutin4. Used two different versions of pMUTIN4 and prepared the ligations below
cotC + pMUTIN4 cut1
cotC + pPMUTIN4 cut2
psc + pMUTIN4 cut 2
We also prepared controls as below
backbone + ligase + no insert
backbone + no liase + no insert

Introduction
Digest pMK-RQ:kinA and pGFP-rrnB:kinA with same enzyme and run DNA on agarose to check whether our Midi prep is the right one.
Experiment procedure
Digest pMK-RQ:kinA and pGFP-rrnB:kinA
EcoRI and NheI  were used for digestion.
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     2ul  Fast EcoRI               0.5ul  Fast NheI                0.5ul  pMK-RQ:kinA               10ul  ------------------------------                            20ul
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     2ul  Fast EcoRI               0.5ul  Fast NheI                0.5ul  pGFP-rrnB:kinA            10ul  ------------------------------                            20ul
37C 1 hour.
Run the sample on 0.8% agarose gel.
Conclusion
The gel picture showed that our kinA clone was not right.
lane 1: lamda ladder  lane 2: 1kb ladder  lane 3: pMK-RQ:kinA  lane 4: pGFP-rrnB:kinA (our NO.6 in transformation)
