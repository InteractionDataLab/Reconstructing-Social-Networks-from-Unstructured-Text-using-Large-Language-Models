Press Coverage
05/02/2009 - iGEM Meeting
Action Points of the Meeting
Read about Bacillus subtilis. Recommended book: Bacillus subtilis and its closest relatives.
Go through all the dates and deadlines including tshirts, logos, project name
Decide on the speakers for the presentation in Boston ->Everyone gives a speech for a couple of minutes
Create a wiki and put everything inside including all the meeting notes, agreed decisions, actions etc.
After finishing the project, Biobrick sequences will be defined in the required format
Presentations will be done internally before we go to Boston
EMBL files will be created to describe the sequence information of Biobrick parts
Synthesis takes 6 weeks and we should have our sequence synthesized no late than the exam finish dates. So that we can start working at the lab after the exams. We should send the sequence to the design company around mid May which means we should finish our design and modelling before May including any software tool.
Identify required skills and put deadlines against them ->Postponed until we have the idea
Learn about the submission deadline for software tools -> Unknown at the moment
Investigate the checklist required to get a gold medal and put a deadline for each of the items in the checklist. -> OK
Investigate the award types and aim to get some of them.->Postponed until we have the idea
Read about quorum sensing in B. subtilis
Pull out some themes from the past projects - OK
Read about germination of spors in B. subtilis
Put names against each deadline. Make someone responsible for each task.
