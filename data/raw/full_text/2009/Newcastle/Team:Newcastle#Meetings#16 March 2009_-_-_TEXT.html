Present our ideas in the form of a flowchart/movie clip
Feedback and discussion
Questions
Show paragraph summarising our idea
Review additional things
NEW Action Points From Last Meeting
Review the questions and challenges put forward for each idea
Do additional reading/research into ideas but more of an emphasis on the first and third ideas
Finalise an idea and write a paragraph on the idea to be posted in the main wiki
Reschedule wiki tutorial with Morgan.
Minutes of the Meeting (16/03/09)
Start: 5p.m at Claremont Tower Room 601, End: 7p.m
Reviewed previous actions points
Funding - Done (Jessica)
Briefly discussed about BioBricks
Discussed about the awarding of the medals
Our project would probably be based on the environmental side
Some of the "easier" awards which can be more "easily" obtained are: Best Wiki, Best Poster, Best Environmental Project, Best Presentations, etc.
One of the criteria for the medal is to help a team, helping a new team would probably be easier.
To make our wiki more attractive, a banner using flash, javascript would be desired, referred to iGEM2008 Heidelberg's wiki as a good reference of a nice wiki.
Brainstormed on the paragraph on our idea to be put on the external wiki.
Brainstormed for our title, coming up with keywords such as
Heavy metals
Stochastic switch
Soil/mud
Tunable
Sporulation
Sequester
Spores
Thousand years memory
Scavenge
Hunter
Seeker
Basillus Subtillis
Kamikaze/Suicde
The Quest to Sequester
Discussed that, perhaps, with the combination of the two ideas, could just use UV light to shine to "test" the sample, instead of having to take a sample and bringing it back to the lab for testing.
Discussed that antibodies could be used in identifying the spores.
Questions
How to extract the metals from the cell?
How can we get metalloproteins into the cells?
Sporulation is induced due to stress, how much metal can we get into the cell?
Action Points of the Meeting (16/03/09)
Familiarise self with BioBricks, website to go: www.partsregistry.org - ALL
Craig, Matthew, Arun to come up with the presentation slides, with the addition of pictures, flow diagrams, instead of just words to present the idea.
Read Nigel Robinson's paper (11 pages) in preparation for Wednesday's (18/03/09) meeting - ALL
Think of questions to ask regarding Nigel Robinson's paper - ALL
Minutes of the Meeting (18/03/09)
Craig, Matthew and Arun presented our project idea to the team and guest advisor Nigel Robinson
Nigel Robinson posted some questions
What metals are we interested in?
Cadmium, Mercury, Arsenic >> Red List metals
Will be difficult to import the red list metals, normally imports Mg, Zn, etc instead and not the red list metals >> Switch the exporter switch for Cd efflux
E.Coli has a mercury importer on ...
Silver will go in through copper??
Importer for Zn in Bacillus, express a protein ...
Put Gsh A, Gsh B into ... (from E.Coli)
Knock out Cad A, then find the maximum Cad A that survived.
Action Points of the Meeting (16/03/09)
List all the BioBricks needed
Develop software systems which stimulates the system
X-Mind (?)
