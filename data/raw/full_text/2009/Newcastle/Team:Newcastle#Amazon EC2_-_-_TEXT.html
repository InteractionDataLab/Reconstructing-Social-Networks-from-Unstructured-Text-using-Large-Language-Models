Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is web service that provides an expandable distributed computing system, created and maintained by the e-commerce company Amazon.com. The Amazon EC2 allows users to purchase time and bandwidth on a flexible number of high powered machines. In this iGEM project the cloud has been used to run our bacterial population simulation.
