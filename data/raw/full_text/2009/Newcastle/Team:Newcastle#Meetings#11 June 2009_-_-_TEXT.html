Review of timetable
Other teams
Action Points
Model of Metal Intake (Ongoing)
Model of sinI Operon (Ongoing, part complete)
Model of comK system -> someone to write a brief summary on the model(Hanny?) (Ongoing, part complete)
Promotor library -> Write a program (Java) (Ongoing, part complete)
Prioritise which bricks to synthesize, pull out individual bits (major, exciting parts that will earn medals) due to limited funds. Example: germination stochastic switch, metal sponge, etc.
Coding (JSim) (James) (Ongoing)
Write up on Cadmium and the environment (Ongoing, part complete)
Decide which awards to aim for, using Matlab would not get a prize, need to use/rewrite models.
Lab space -> Need to take turns, therefore need to come up with a proper schedule
External wiki photos are to be uploaded instead of placeholder images (James) - Done, but may improve.
Jen to email the team photos.
Do a new version of the timetable.
Plan for a week off before coming back for next teaching year (September-ish), to relax before even more work.
Edinburgh itinerary to be emailed to group (Jen).
Create an informal talk/presentation for the Edinburgh trip, we will run through this either on the Thursday meeting, or on an extra Friday meeting - this should contain some, but not too much technical detail, eg genes.
Phil to be added to the mailing list.
Mintes of the meeting
Students present: Goksel, James, Jane, Jess, Matt
Students absent: Hanny, Arun, Craig
Instructors present: Jen, Phil Aldridge, Dan
Chair: Goksel
Minute taker: James
The group introduced themselves to Phil Aldridge, whose lab we will be working in.
The group gave a brief overview of the project, up to the exam period, ran through action points.
Promoter library - Hanny in Matlab - prices and problems.
Sigma (70) - Phil asked what we were looking for a change of response to, but we clarified that it was the 'strength' of the promoters.
Clarified the use of JSim, as a tool for running CellML models, then parsing the output data.
Why do we want to clean up Cadmium from the environment? Showed the prepared draft document - "All" wording to be changed to "many" - airborne distribution - batteries in rubbish dumps - what industries use Cd - how big of a problem is it? - university staff located in the Devonshire building may be able to help.
Need DNA design before Neil gets back.
Push back lab work, due to trip, holidays and exams.
Edinburgh - tickets are booked for those who have confirmed that they are going - staying in student accommodation.
Lab introduction/tutorial set for Wednesday 17 June 2pm in the Leech building - Students are to meet outside of Medical Building at 1:45pm - L2.4, Offices - Dan M2046, Phil M2107.
Ran though what some of the other teams were doing, and had a small discussion about some of them.
Lab work to start on Monday 29 June, as there will be free space, as 2 people who normally work there are off. During the 1st week we should not expect to get much work done, as we will be learning - there will be plenty of help if needed, eg 2 PHD students are available until the end of July.
Lab refresher (Neil?) - Making media, plasmids, streak strains, ect.
We may get together with other teams later on and work with them.
Hanny, Goksel and Jen are to work on the promoter library, rest are to work on BioBricks, could use Sequentia.
Next meetings:
Tuesday 12pm
Wednesday 1:45pm
Thursday 16:00
Friday TBC
