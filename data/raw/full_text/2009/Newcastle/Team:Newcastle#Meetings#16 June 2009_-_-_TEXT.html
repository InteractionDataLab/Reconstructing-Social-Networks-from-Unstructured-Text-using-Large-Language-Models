Press Coverage
IGEM Meeting 11 June 2009
Chair: None
Students present: James, Matt
Meeting abandoned
Action points from last meeting
Model of Metal Intake (Ongoing)
Model of sinI Operon (Ongoing, part complete)
Model of comK system -> someone to write a brief summary on the model(Hanny?) (Ongoing, part complete)
Promotor library -> Write a program (Java) (Ongoing, part complete)
Prioritise which bricks to synthesize, pull out individual bits (major, exciting parts that will earn medals) due to limited funds. Example: germination stochastic switch, metal sponge, etc.
Coding (JSim) (James) (Ongoing)
Write up on Cadmium and the environment (Ongoing, part complete)
Decide which awards to aim for, using Matlab would not get a prize, need to use/rewrite models.
Lab space -> Need to take turns, therefore need to come up with a proper schedule
External wiki photos are to be uploaded instead of placeholder images (James) - Done, but may improve.
Migrate pages to external wiki.
CCS template issues on Firefox/Safari, ect
Jen to email the team photos.
Do a new version of the timetable.
Plan for a week off before coming back for next teaching year (September-ish), to relax before even more work.
Edinburgh itinerary to be emailed to group (Jen).
Create an informal talk/presentation for the Edinburgh trip, we will run through this either on the Thursday meeting, or on an extra Friday meeting - this should contain some, but not too much technical detail, eg genes.
Phil to be added to the mailing list.
