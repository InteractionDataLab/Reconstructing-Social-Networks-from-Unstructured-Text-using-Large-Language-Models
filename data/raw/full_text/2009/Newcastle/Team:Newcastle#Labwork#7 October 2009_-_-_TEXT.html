Formal Lab Session - 7th October 2009
We succeed in cotC transformation, lots of colonies grow on LB+Amp plates. We will culture the colonies for Mini prep and Midi Prep.
Even we got few colonies on LB+Amp plate for kinA transformation, we need to repeat transformation today and use LB + spectinomycin as antibiotic selection.
Experiment procedure
CotC PCR
We wanted to start from scracth for CotC biobrick. We will also PCR it. CotC
1ul of CotC biobrick synthesised in PMK  39ul of PCR water
GoTaq
2ul GoTaq 18ul H2O
PCR Mix:
per tube: 10ul 5xGoTaq buffer prepared above + 5uk DNTP
Tubes(Prepared 6 tubes):
26ul H2O 15ul PCR mx 2.5 ul forward primer (It was diluted before) 2.5 ul reverse primer 2ul template prepared above (For the 6. tube, control tube, used water instead)
We setup 6 PCR reactions in two groups. Group 1 (3 tubes)
50C annealing temperature 90seconds extesnion time 31 cycles
Group 1 (2 tubes + control)
52C annealing temperature 90seconds extesnion time 31 cycles
we run the PCR products on the gel . run 8uk os PCR product from 6 tubes. The results were good for all tubes. We then cleaned the PCR products using the  PCR clean-up kit.
Restriction Digest for pmutin4
We did restriction digest with two controls to see is the enzymes were working well. If they work we will clean the gel for pmutin4.
pmutin4 Digest with HindIII and BamHI
H20 26ul 10x Buffer E 5ul DNA 15ul HindIII 2ul BamHI 2ul
pmutin4 Digest with HindIII only
H20 15.5ul 10x Buffer E 2ul DNA 2ul HindIII 0.5ul
pmutin4 Digest with BamHI only
H20 15.5ul 10x Buffer E 2ul DNA 2ul BamHIIII 0.5ul
Mixed the tubes well and incubated for three hours at 37C
In the meantime prepared 1xTAE buffer and 0.8% agarose gel.
Run the digests on the gel
Digest1:50ul from the digest + 10ul 10X loading buffer Digest2:9ul from the digest + 1ul 10X loading buffer Digest3:9ul from the digest + 1ul 10X loading buffer
pmutin 4 digest results were not very clear!
E.coli Transformation
Since we used wrong medium for yesterdays E.coli transformation, there was no colony grow for kinA transformation, so we redo E.coli transformation today.
1ul pGFP-rrnB:kinA vector was used for E.coli transformation.
All transformation cells were sprayed on LB+Spec plates
B.subtilis transformation
To save our kinA DNA and to make sure that our B.subtilis transformation work, we did a B.subtilis transformation with pure pGFP-rrnB plasmid.
1. 0.4ml B.subtilis cell   +  pGFP-rrnB      5ul  2. 0.4ml B.subtilis cell   +  pGFP-rrnB      5ul  3. 0.4ml no cell control   +  water          5ul  4. 0.4ml B.subtilis cell   +  water          5ul
All transformed cells were sprayed on LB+CHL plates (CHL concentration 5ug/ml)
Yesterday's transformation cells left were sprayed on  LB+CHL plates (CHL concentration 5ug/ml)
Culture cells for mini and midi prep
Picked up colonies for cotC transformation.
Picked up colonies growed on LB+Amp for kinA transformation.
5ml LB+Amp/ LB+Spec liquid medium were used for culture.
50ml liquid LB+Amp medium for cotC midi prep culture.
