Using the Speed Vac Machine
Setting up the Speed Vac and Inserting the Samples
Make sure the valve of the Speed Vac machine is set to the closed position; if in the closed position, switch on the pump.
Switch on the cooler/vapour trap.
Set 'Drying Rate' to "HIGH"
It is important that the pump and the cooler have been running for at least 10 minutes prior to carrying out aspirations - this gives the machine time to reach the correct temperature.
Open the Speed Vac Machine lid and insert the Eppendorf tubes making sure that the lids are open. Also ensure that the Eppendorf tubes are placed in a symmetrical fashion so that a balance is maintained.
Set the 'Concentrator' to "ON"
Slowly set the valve to the open position.
Leave samples in the Soeed Vac Machine for 5 minutes initially, checking on it's progress afterwards.
Removing the Samples and Turning off the Speed Vac Machine
Slowly set the valve to the closed position
Open the lid and check on the tubes; if they are dry remove them from the Speed vac Machine. If you are not satisfied with the progress, leave the tubes in the Speed Vac Machine for an additional minute (by closing the lid and re-opening the valve).
Once the Eppendorf tubes have been removed, close the lid and re-open the valve slowly.
Set the 'Concentrator' to "OFF"
Switch off the cooler/vapour trap
Switch off the pump
Slowly return the valve to the closed position.
