Funny Photos
Below are humourous photos of members of Team Newcastle - many of them taken when they least expected it!
James and Mathew's reaction once they had discovered there was still ethanol left in the Midi-prepped DNA samples, leading to DNA gel electrophoresis failure
James goes a little crazy in the lab but soon makes a new friend...
...who, armed with the latest BlackBerry phone and laptop, proved to be a key member of the team!!!
Mathew finally realises where he is...
...whilst Jess has problems of her own
It's amazing what desperate measures Mathew will take to rescue Jess' pen from the jaws of the orbital incubator
It's important to take breaks when it comes to lab work as this photograph shows...
