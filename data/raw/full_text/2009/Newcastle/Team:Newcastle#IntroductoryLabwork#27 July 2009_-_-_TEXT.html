Introductory Lab Session - 27th July 2009
Introduction
Last week the team had completed the ethanol precipitation of the GFP and RFP (in plasmids pSB1A2 and pSB1AT3 respectively) DNA samples. They are midi-prepped plasmid DNA samples extracted using Sigma-Aldrich's GenElute Midi-prep kit , however the ethanol present in Wash Solution 2 hadn't been completely removed so ethanol precipitation was necessary. With the ethanol removed, it should be analyse the samples through DNA gel electrophoresis.
Practical Outline
Run the GFP and RFP plasmid DNA samples on gel through DNA gel electrophoresis and analyse.
