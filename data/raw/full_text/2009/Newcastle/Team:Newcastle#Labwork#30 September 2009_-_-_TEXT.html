Formal Lab Session - 30th September 2009
Chassis team
Introduction
Since we got the Midi Prep of kinA transformation, we have enough plasmid which are enought for digestion test. We take Chris's advice to use new ladder which would be more accurate in measuring DNA's size.
Experiment procedure
Digestion
Digestion reaction
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     2ul  Fast BamHI               0.5ul  Fast HindIII             0.5ul  Mini Prep DNA             10ul  ------------------------------                            20ul
K1: kinA midi result digested by EcoRI and NheI
K1: kinA midi result digested by HindIII
Other three digest sample came from Jess's mini prep for sac transformation.
Conclusion
Lane 3,4 were K1, K2 digested result. The kinA fragment is 2048bp, so the kinA band should be at the same position with the 6th band of lamda ladder or the 8th band of 1kb ladder. But the gel picture showed that those three bands were not at the same level. Even the ladder are not consist with each other. To confirm our kinA clone result, we need digested pMK-RQ as a standard control.
