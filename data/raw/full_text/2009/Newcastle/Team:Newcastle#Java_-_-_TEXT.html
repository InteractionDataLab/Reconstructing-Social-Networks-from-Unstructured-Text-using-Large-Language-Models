Java
Java is a general purpose programming language. Developed by Sun Microsystems.
The Newcastle team used Java for their Gold award winning project last year, so we have decided to once again use this technology. Java is the main programming language taught at Newcastle University.
Development of the population model took place in various IDEs including IntelliJ, Eclipse and NetBeans. For managing databases we also used PostgreSQL.

JSim
To bridge the gap between agent based models (Java) and cellular models (CellML), the Newcastle team are using a software product called JSim, developed by the University of Washington.
Graphics
For the graphical output of the population model, we have also used the Java3D technology and the Autodesk 3ds Max application to produce 3D animated graphics.
Models developed
The following are models which we have developed using Java:
