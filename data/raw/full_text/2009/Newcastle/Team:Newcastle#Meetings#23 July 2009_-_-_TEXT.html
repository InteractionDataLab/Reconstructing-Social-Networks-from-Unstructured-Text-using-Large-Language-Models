The program "Sequentia" is actually spelt as "Sequencher"
Mathew will be assisting with the PL
No lab sessions on Mondays until further notice
Minutes
Lab Rota
We will be able to get 2 teams at once
Chrissie will be cleaning up her bench for us
Need to put more photos on the external wikis, especially instructors' pictures
Shuttle vector (E.Coli to B.subtilis): Neil couldn't find one of those, maybe dead end? Have asked Cambridge about it, they said that they submitted a vector last year but it's doesn't work well. Maybe could we improve it?
Think about helping another team: look at Groningen's BioBricks, and think about swapping bricks.
Revise the advisor list on the wiki
Does Pr.Nigel Robinson want to be on the mailing list and an advicer?
Try and learn how to use Sequencher and Clone Manager
Marketing team ( Mat and Arun ) to get the money. We have raised 12,000pounds, need an extra 5,000 pounds. Neil gave a list of companies we can talk to.
Presentations
Sporulation/Population Modelling team
Stochastic switch team
Metal intake team
Action Points for the next meeting
Ask about project description (Jess)
Send BioBrick design to Neil (Arun)
Ask Pr.Nigel Robinson if he wants to be an advisor (Mat)
Think about the project title; BacMan,the Quest to Sequester?
Need to put more pictures on the wiki (Mat)
Collect pictures of the team from those who took pictures (Arun)
Write personal descriptions on the wiki and ask the instructors and advisor to do so (Arun)
Have a look at the shuttle vector that Cambridge submitted last year (Leave for later)
Look at Groningen's BioBrick design (leave for later)
Need to set up a meeting with Noel from Sunderland (Goksel)
Put modelling stuff and presentations on the wiki (Mat)
Need to calculate how much the stochastic BioBrick will cost (Jess)
