Matt Pocock needs to fill in ESTA form
Create a page on the wiki about ethics (Mathew)
Fill Valencia's questionnaire (everyone)
Get Hanny guest student card
Search for other websites for those green "bugs" (Jess)
Contact Nigel Robinson to use his lab and the electronmicroscope
Citate the papers in the wiki for metal sensing. Quote short sentences where necessary.
Goksel to send DNA off to Parts Registry.
Last Week's Specialist Action Points
Lab
Hanny to sequence BioBricks
Wiki
Need to update lab work section
Need to study Imperial 2008 iGEM wiki's video for ideas.
Redraw and add colour to diagram on front page currently (the process chart) - possibly using Omnigraffle for Mac
The "Eco Warrior" story, which is currently on the front page of the wiki, needs to go in the 'Fun and Games' section.
Put a diagram of a Bacillus subtilis' cell on the front page of the wiki with elements of the project e.g. Cadmium sensing, stochastic switch, etc included
Make a date for Sunday 11th October for students meetup to take photos around the university/city.
Presentation
Sub-project teams need to send at least two slides with some information on them.
Presentation practice to be held on 23rd October - times to be decided
Poster
Jess needs to update team by next week
Each team to create document for the poster creation.
Modelling
Make a date for a Modelling meeting to work out parameter values, and how to integrate into population model.
T-shirt/Marketing
Get t-shirt designs to printing company
Minutes
Introduced the team to Zoltan
Labwork
Hanny - kinA worked, now in E.coli, transforming into B.subtilis - need to make sure it has gone into amyE - plating out onto starch and IPGT plates looking for spores and halos - if done, characterised!
Goksel - cotC, re-PCRed, re-cut into pMutin4 - should work now.
Stocastic Switch still stuck at 85% complete.
Metal Sensor also stuck at 85% complete.
Safety Officer visted the lab - Arun, Mat and Hanny were not wearing lab coats - Mat and Arun should not have been there.
Goksel is to go on some safety courses, if he is to be in the lab in the future.
Sequence Biobricks - not done yet - tell Phil that we will pay.
Request for variance still pending.
May need to clone kinA into Biobrick compatible vector.
On last weeks APs
For pMutin4 sequencing primers, just use pMutin2 sequence.
Dan emailed Matt Pocock to check if he has done the ESTA.
Mat still needs to do the ethics page.
Goksel and Jess still need to do Valencia's questionairre.
Hanny still needs a guest card.
Could make our own green bugs
Nigel Robinson replied - need to ask him about other metals.
Need to cite papers.
Prepare DNA for submission - watch for postal strike.
Wiki
Lab Rota to be removed. (James - done)
Duplicate project overview to be removed. (James - done)
Header photo to be changed.
Add images/text for Next and Previous.
Reviewed animations - liked, and using.
Need to change format of Matt's video, and upload. (James)
All teams need to update lab book.
Photo date set for Saturday 10th at 10:00am.
Presentation
Practice Presentation with the Bioinformatics group is set for Friday 23rd October at 1-2pm.
Still doing a presentation in Sunderland?
Use Sir Bac Man as first slide.
Explain the life cycle and how we are changing it.
Arun has prepared a document.
Jen and Neil are away in Spain 17-21 October.
Each team is to send Arun more detail.
Poster
Jen in to send links to designs.
Jess' draft has too much small text - more images and talking!
Need to get back to sponsors to show them what we have achieved.
Could use a complex wheel to point to various points of the poster.
Each team is to send Jess more detail.
Modelling
Send a list of parameters for the population model (James - done)
Inspect G.g.n's code for online model (James)
Arrange a modelling meeting - Monday (internal) (James)
T-shirts
Due to the situation - reduce the number to about 15, and increase the price £20-30
Could get it partially done by professionals, then iron on bits - small logos.
Could use white shirts.
Could use other companies.
