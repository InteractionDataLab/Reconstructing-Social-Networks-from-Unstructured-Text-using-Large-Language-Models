Introductory Lab Session: 1st July 2009
Today's introductory lab session saw the team progress with the next steps in the making competent cells procedure (i.e. steps 2 and 3 in the 'Pre-culture section). The team also looked at the future steps involved in the protocol and prepared solutions and equipment accordingly. This lab session (as well as the previous one) taught the team the importance of planning, organisation and time management.
Things needed for today's session
Jess streaking some agar plates
Jane applying aseptic technique
Things we need for today include:
LB
Containers
Sterile tubes
Space in orbital shaking incubator for tonight
Progressing with making competent cells
We plated out single cultures from yesterday's plates for a practice.
We inoculated 2ml of LB with single cultures from yesterday's plates and put them in the shaking incubator.
We made up some 50% glycerol and it was sent to be autoclaved.
Preparations for next lab session
Considerations
How much equipment (e.g. tubes) and solutions have we used today? Is there enough for Thursday's lab session?
Things we need for tomorrow (Thursday):
General
Sterile tubes
Pipette tips
Solutions
'Culture' Step (from making competent cells protocol )
Sterile flasks for culture (500ml)
Spectrophotometer and cuvettes (where)
Arrange space in shaking incubator
'Harvest cells' Step (from making competent cells protocol )
Centrifuge/ centrifuge vial (200ml?)
Ice bucket and ice
Glycerol
Sterile microfuge tubes
