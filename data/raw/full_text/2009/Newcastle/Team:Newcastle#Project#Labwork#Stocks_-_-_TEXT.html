Introductory Lab Sessions (30th June - 27th July)
To train up the members of our team who hadn't experienced lab work before, and to sharpen the skills of the team members who had, our advisers planned a period of introductory lab sessions. These experiments were based around growing cell cultures and making E.coli cells competent whilst making us aware of important lab principles such as handling of equipment, aseptic technique, lab etiquette, etc. Please see calendar below:
