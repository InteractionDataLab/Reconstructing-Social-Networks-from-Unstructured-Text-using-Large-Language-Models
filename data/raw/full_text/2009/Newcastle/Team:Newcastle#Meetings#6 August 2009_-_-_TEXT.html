The need for more money (Sponsors) - Arun and Mat emailed.

New action points
Design biobricks and primers in Sequencher.
Submit Preliminary Project Track details to iGEM HQ by 7 August (TOMORROW!).
Change NheI cutsite with another cutsite in teh designs since it is used in the integration vectors
Find the integration vector to use at the lab
Find out for which nongerminating strains is the protocol
Use pmutin4's promoter for the pspac promoter in the designs
Do not knock out the original cotC in Bacillus subtilis strain
Write to the Cornell team for collaboration.
Contact to Groningen team (Neil)
Minutes
We have been sent two strains in spore forms and they cannot germinate. In one of them, the spore coat is engineered and in the other one enzymes requierd the break the spore wall are not produced to prevent germination.
We can run teh primers on 2% ararose gel.
Primer synthesis is a quick and cheap process
We may use lacZ for the promoter library
