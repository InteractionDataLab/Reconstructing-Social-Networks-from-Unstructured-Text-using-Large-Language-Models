Formal Lab Session - 25th September 2009
Chassis team
Introduction
To obtain pspac part from pMutin4, we digested psc fragment with HindIII and BamHI
We need Mini prep kinA transformation and check the result.
Experiment procedure
Digestion
Digest psc clean-up DNA
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     7ul  Fast HindIII               3ul  Fast BamHI                 3ul  psc clean-up DNA          50ul  ------------------------------                            70ul
Incubate 1 hour at 37 degree
Gel Extraction
After the digestion of psc fragment we run the digested DNA on big well gel and cut the right band and purified the DNA by gel extraction kit.
Mini prep
Followed the Phil's protocal.
Since we cultured 24 colonies yesterday, we performed Mini Prep for all those 24 strains.
Test the Mini Prep result
Digested the Mini Prep DNA with EcoRI and NheI
dd H2O                     7ul  10X fast digest buffer     2ul  Fast EcoRI               0.5ul  Fast NheI                0.5ul  Mini Prep DNA             10ul  ------------------------------                            20ul
37C incubated for 1 hour
Add 2ul stop buffer and run the sample on agarose gel.
Ligation
Ligate psc fragment with pMutin4 backbone
ddH2O                             10ul  ligation buffer                    4ul  psc fragments                     10ul  pMutin4 backbone (24.9ng/ul)       5ul  T4 ligase                          1ul  --------------------------------------                                    30ul
conclusion
After the digestion of kinA transformation Mini Prep result, it seems No.4,5,6,10 could be the right clone. So, we prepare Midi culture for all 4 strains.
Futher plan
Use HindIII enzyme digest Mini prep result of those 4 strains to double check the result.
