Press Coverage
Microbase
The Microbase is a system for managing distributed computing applications. It has been developed by a team in the School of Computing Science at Newcastle University. For this iGEM project it has been used to manage the running of the population simulation program. For help using the Microbase system we must give special thanks to Keith Flanagan, one of the researchers at Newcastle, who is involved in the Microbase project.
Models developed
The following are models which we have developed using Microbase:
