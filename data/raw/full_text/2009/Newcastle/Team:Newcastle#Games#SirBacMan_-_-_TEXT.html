The Sir BacMan Story
Thy Quest to Sequester
We see our bacteria as tiny eco-warriors, brave and selfless in their actions.
The Bacillus Battle Cry.
2009, this is our year! So now, let us survey the land. We learn of injustice, imbalance and destruction, with forces from our past, which hold us hostage to our future.
Poison is the ancient currency – not ours. Let us expunge these vile deeds and make a better world.
Rise up Sir Bac-Man and devour this toxic injustice. Let us follow your banner, and let our voices raise  your motto, your challenge, your sacrifice....it is yours and mine...
"Thy Quest to Sequester!" Unwind your flag, and rouse you in your ancient inheritance. For now, by our design, you will condemn this villainy to jail a thousand years.
So to battle my microscopic friends ... and you so small... so few... you tiny band of genetically engineered siblings, in our debt may you always be re-mem-ber-ed.
Sir Bac-Man, to victory!
