1 Steps to use the PCR products
1.1 PCR Clean-up
1.2 Digest the PCR product
1.3 Extract the DNA from the gel
1.4 Ligate the PCR product with the plasmid backbone
1.5 Transform E.coli
Steps to use the PCR products
PCR Clean-up
Use PCR Clean-up kit to extract the DNA. This should result in 50ul of final product
Digest the PCR product
Check the restriction sites and replace EcoRI and SpeI as you need)
Prepare a final volume of 70ul using
- 50ul of the PCR product - 3ul of fast digest EcoRI - 3ul of fast digest SpeI - 7ul of 10X buffer - Use water to make the final volume 70ul
Mix everything well and incubate at 37C for an hour
Run the total 70ul on the gel using large wells
Extract the DNA from the gel
Cut the gel fragment containing the DNA and extract the DNA. The final volume of the DNA will be 50ul.
Run 5ul of extracted DNA on the gel to make sure it is right
Measure the concentration of the DNA
Ligate the PCR product with the plasmid backbone
Ligate the extracted DNA with the plasmid backbone(e.g pSC1AT3) cut with the appropriate sites(E.g EcoRI and SpeI)
Prepare a final volume of 30ul using
- 3ul of ligation buffer(it is in the freezer) - 1ul of ligase - x (To be decided) ul of the backbone - y (To be decided) ul of the insert (PCR product) - Water totalling to 30ul
Leave the mix on the bench for three hours. To leave overnight suspend the eppendorf tube in a water box and place it in the fridge overnight
Transform E.coli
Transform E.coli with the plasmid containing the insert
Use the total 30ul for the transformation
For (+) control, use the plasmid without any insert
For (-) control, use water to transform
