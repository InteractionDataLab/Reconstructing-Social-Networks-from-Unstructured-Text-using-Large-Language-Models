Our City
Newcastle upon Tyne
We are the team from Newcastle University, which is one of two universities in the North East city of Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom.
The city is famed for its rich history, and its numerous bridges that span the River Tyne, crossing to the town of Gateshead. The city is full of diverse culture, with this partly being shown by short-listed bids to gain the European Capital of Culture title. One of the cities leading museums, the Great North Museum: Hancock, is supported by the university.
Newcastle had large coal mining and manufacturing industries through the 19th and 20th centuries, and has since gained a reputation as a shopping haven and a party-city. It is also the home of a world famous soccer club, Newcastle United , and the beer Newcastle Brown Ale .
Newcastle has recently been famous for being the home, Northern Rock, of the first bank that fell during the 2007 financial crisis.
Past students
Newcastle has had a large number of famous people as past students of the Universities including actor Rowan Atkinson, and singer Bryan Ferry. Newcastle's neighbour Northumbria University was home to Jonathan Ive, the designer of Apple computers recent products including the iPod, iMac and iPhone. Even this year at Newcastle University a member of the royal family is among our freshers students; Princess Eugenie of York, sixth in line to the British throne.

Whether you want to have a cultured experience in our galleries and museums, party in our amazing selection of bars and clubs, eat stunning food, meet friendly people, or just have the time of your life Newcastle is the place to be!
By Air, Sea, Rail or Road
By Rail Newcastle is accessible via the Newcastle Railway Station, which lies on the main East coast line of Britian. The station was opened in 1850, designed by John Dobson, a famed designer in the North East, and built in collaboration with Northern engineer Robert Stephenson. Robert Stephenson's father, George Stephenson was a pioneer of steam powered railways. The station is located in the city centre near the River Tyne.
By Road Newcastle lies on the A1 road which follows the route of one of the historic roads of Britian, the Great North Road. The Great North Road was used for some of the first national mail delivery coaches from London to Edinburgh. Some of the University's main buildings including King's Gate are on the roads around the Great North Road.
By Air Newcastle can by reached by catching one of the many flights to Newcastle International Airport. The airport was opened in 1935 and is located just outside the city in Woolsington. The two most popular flights from Newcastle are to London Heathrow and Amsterdam in the Netherlands.
By Sea the city of Newcastle lies on the River Tyne. Ferries run to various destinations in Europe from North Shields - the mouth of the Tyne on the east coast. Why not come and see our vast array of Bridges.
