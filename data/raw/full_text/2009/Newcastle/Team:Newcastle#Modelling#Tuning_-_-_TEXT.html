Press Coverage
One of the modelling areas in this metal sequestering project is to model the behaviour of our kinA sporulation system. This is a system which we hope to use to tune the frequency of sporulation.
This is a model which is being developed in CellML, via COR, and SBML, via COPASI.
This model has also been integrated into the population model, via JSim.
