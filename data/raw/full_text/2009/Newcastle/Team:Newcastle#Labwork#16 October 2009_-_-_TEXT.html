2.3 KinA
Microscopy Test to characterize KinA
We labelled the five overnight cultures with 10ml of LB+ B. subtilis as below
Wild type B. subtilis (- Control)
B. subtilis transformed with pgdp-rrnb+KinA biobrick (+ Control)
BFS867, transformed with pgdp-rrnb+KinA biobrick
BFS840, transformed with pgdp-rrnb+KinA biobrick
BFS82426, transformed with pgdp-rrnb+KinA biobrick
We prepared the flasks as below
Flask1(-):5ml overnight culture 1 + 60ml LB
Flask1(+):5ml overnight culture 1 + 60ml LB
Flask2(-):5ml overnight culture 2 + 60ml LB + CHL
Flask2(+):5ml overnight culture 2 + 60ml LB + CHL
Flask3(-):5ml overnight culture 3 + 60ml LB + CHL + Em
Flask3(+):5ml overnight culture 3 + 60ml LB + CHL + Em
Flask4(-):5ml overnight culture 4 + 60ml LB + CHL + Em
Flask2(+):5ml overnight culture 4 + 60ml LB + CHL + Em
Flask5(-):5ml overnight culture 5 + 60ml LB + CHL + Em
Flask5(+):5ml overnight culture 6 + 60ml LB + CHL + Em
Placed the flasks in shaking inwater bath at 37C. After an hour later we added IPTG to the relevant flasks. Every half an hour we took samples from each flask.
We used the samples from time point 1 and 5 for the microscopy.
We spinned the tubes for 2 min at 13000rpm
Discarded the LB
Resuspended in 500ul of SMM
Spinned again and discarded SMM
Resuspended in 50ul of SMM
Prepared the samples for microscopy

Pictures below display the results from the 5th and 6th cultures. The 5th and 6th samples were taken from BFS667 transformed with pgfp-rrnb. The 5th one does noo have any IPTG hence no GFP whereas the 6th one has lots of GFP with sporulation. Hence we can conlude that sporulation was triggered by our biobrick. :) We managed to get the results we expected. Congrulations to everyone in the team!

Sending parts to the registry
Today, we prepared the synthesised bricks and placed them to the box ready to send to the parts registry.
Stochastic Switch
Suspended 5ug of the DNA in PMK backbone with 30ul of PCR water. (Final concentration:166ng/ul)
To send to the parts registry (final concentration:6.7 ng/ul in 20 ul)
0.8ul of DNA 19ul of water
AND Gate
Suspended 5ug of the DNA in pSB1AT3 backbone with 30ul of PCR water. (Final concentration:166ng/ul) To send to the parts registry (final concentration:6.7 ng/ul in 20 ul)
0.8ul of DNA 19ul of water
KinA
Measured the concentration of KinA as 64ng/ul Prepared the tube to send to the registry (6.4ng/ul)
2ul Kina in PMK  18ul of PCR water
