Press Coverage
11/02/2009 - Internal iGEM Student Meeting
Discussed in the meeting:
Updated the timeline for the meeting on 12/02/09:
Set deadlines discussed in previous meetings by working back from the due date given by iGEM in the e-mails
Discussed the different aspects required for gold, silver and bronze trophies and added deadlines to the timetable.
Briefly discussed which special prizes we could go for but decided it will be easier when we have a project to set deadlines for this.
Thought about when the masters students are doing their writing up and discussed how we could utilise this time.
Discussed some papers on B. subtilis
Discussed some more ideas for the project and their feasibility
