Formal Lab Session - 6th October 2009
Today we did B. subtilis transformations using our ptotocol. We prepared the LB+ CHL(Chloramphenicol) plates since we will transform the cells with pGFP-rrnB.  We used 5ml 2.5 mg/ml stock of CHL, however it should have been 2 ml since the final concentration should have been 5ug/ml CHL.
We did miniprep to look for CotC+ pmutin4 colonies. We used 12 ON cultures. Finally we did a restriction digest with HindIII and BamHI. But we could not find a right colony again. Although the transformations seemed worked we had colonies on both "backbone+ no ligase + no insert" and "backbone+ ligase + no insert". Our transformations dd not have the ligated product! Digest:
H20 11ul Buffer 2ul DNa 5ul HindIII 1ul BamHI 1ul
Control Digest:
H20 13ul Buffer 2ul uncut pmutin4 2ul HindIII 1ul BamHI 1ul
The bands were pmutin4 were not very clear and we decided to do a midiprep for pmutin4 again.
Experiment procedure
B.subtilis transformation
1. kinA+pGFP-rrnB from geneArt           10ul    LB+CHL 100ul  2. pGFP-rrnB plasmid                      5ul  3. pSB1AT3                                5ul    LB+CHL 200ul  4. water                                 10ul
The concentration of CHL was too high for transformed cells to grow.
E.coli transformation
1. kinA + pGFP-rrnB backbone             20ul    LB+CHL plate  2. psc fragment + pMutin4 backbone       20ul    LB+Amp plate  3. kinA+pGFP-rrnB from geneArt            2ul    LB+Amp plate and LB+CHL plate  4. cotC+pSB1AT3 from geneArt              2ul    LB+Amp plate  5. pSB1AT3                               10ul    LB+Amp plate  6. water                                 10ul    LB+Amp plate
