1.2.1 GENERAL SAFETY RULES
1.2.2 GENERAL LABORATORY RULES
Laboratory Rules
During the project the team made sure that the laboratory rules were adhered to, enabling us to all work in a safe environment. As well as the official rules, there were rules which we created based on things we had learned in the lab.
Rules/notes made by Team Newcastle
Always use the distilled water from the green tap
Always label things at the lab with the red tape. Put the initials, the lab name (PA), date and its contents
For anything which needs to be autoclaved, label, stick the autoclave tape, and send for autoclaving
Clean the bench before and after the work with ethanol
Dry the cases before using them
Keep a bottle/beaker of distilled water to use on the table
No actual work is allowed after 5 or 6 pm - if the autoclaver is needed, the experiments requiring it should be presented to the operator by 4pm
Official Rules
Below is a summary list of the official laboratory rules devised by the Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences, Newcastle University:
GENERAL SAFETY RULES
The following general rules shall be obeyed:
It is a requirement for insurance purposes that nobody works in the Institute/School without the Director of Institute’s/Head of School’s agreement before work starts.
Visitors who are not working in the Institute/School should not be allowed to work in laboratories.
Doors marked FIRE DOOR must not be wedged or otherwise fastened in the open position.
In case of emergency evacuation (when the fire alarm sounds continuously) leave the building via the posted fire exits.  Walk briskly and assemble at Fire Assembly Point without blocking the path of emergency vehicles or personnel.  The building may be re-entered again when told it is safe to do so by a Fire Marshall. See Institute/School Safety Policy for Plan of Assembly Points.
Familiarise yourself with emergency numbers e.g. FIRE, POLICE, AMBULANCE 6666 or 9-999, Cardiac Arrest: 21-353, University Police: 6345.
Any accidents which result in injury or damage must be reported to the Institute/School Safety Officer and reported to the Safety Office using the online form .
First Aid kits are located in most labs.
No person must work alone if involved or likely to be involved in operations that are potentially dangerous. The absolute minimum is that the person is within easy hailing distance of a colleague.
All Students, Postgraduates, Postdocs, Research Associates and Technicians wishing to work outside of normal hours (8am – 6pm) may only do so if authorised by their Supervisor.
Anyone who has a suspicion they may be pregnant should seek advice from Occupational Health.
Smoking is not permitted anywhere in the University.
Care must be taken not to transfer hazardous materials from gloves to surfaces such as door handles; one hand must be ungloved to open doors etc.
New equipment delivered to the Institute/School or brought from home (e.g. lamps, fans) must be checked by the Workshop (1st floor,  Cookson ) before use. Electrical plugs must only be fitted by the workshop.
Display Screen Equipment & Laser
UV Radiation
GENERAL LABORATORY RULES
Members of academic staff are responsible for the safety of all laboratories they supervise and for all personnel working in these laboratories.  Academic staff are particularly responsible for safety monitoring and tuition of postgraduates they supervise and for undergraduate practical classes assigned to them.
Protective clothing must be worn during operations with hazardous materials. Absolutely no food or drink should be consumed in the laboratory.
Before starting work, all persons must satisfy themselves that they are aware of any likely potential hazards and of the safety precautions, which are appropriate to each specific area. COSHH and BIOCOSHH risk assessment forms must be completed. See web-sites:
Chemicals
Biological Hazards
Radioactivity
There are strict guidelines on the disposal of all types of waste. For details, please visit the Institute/School Safety Policy
Immunisation and Health Surveillance  : Those who work with animals must have a health surveillance check and it is recommended they are immunised against tetanus. It is strongly recommended that those who work with human material or fluids containing human products be immunised against Hepatitis B and in certain cases Hepatitis A.
