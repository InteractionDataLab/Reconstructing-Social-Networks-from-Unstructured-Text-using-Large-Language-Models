Formal Lab Session - 24th August 2009
Overview
Stochastic Switch Team - prepared overnight cultures from transformant E. coli cells containing BioBricks from last week, i.e. BBa_R0062, BBa_R0079, BBa_C0161, BBa_C0179, and BBa_J44000

Summary
Today was dedicated to finishing our cloning strategies and primer designs, and so lab was called off. However the stochastic switch team had time to set up some overnight cultures to redo the minipreps and restriction digests for the biobricks from last week. These will be carried out tomorrow. We mixed the colonies in 3 ml of LB+Amp and left them overnight in shaking incubator. To prepare LB + Amp solution we used 5ml of LB + 250ul of Amp. 12 cultures were left overnight.
