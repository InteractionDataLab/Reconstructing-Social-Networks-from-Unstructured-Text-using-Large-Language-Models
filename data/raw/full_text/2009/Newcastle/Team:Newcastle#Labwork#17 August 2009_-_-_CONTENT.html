This was done by firstly drawing a grid of 46 squares on the base of the agar plate and then marking each square with the bacteria. Into square 1, untransformed wild type <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> was added and into squares 2-46, <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> transformed with <I>gfp-rrnb</I> was added. These plates were then grown overnight. 
</P><P>The reason for this exercise is to see whether the bacteria that have survived the chloramphenicol treatment really have been given this property by taking up <I>gfp-rrnb</I>. If the bacteria can't break down the starch which surrounds them on these plates then they have surely taken up the plasmid vector; if they can break down the starch then they might have received the resistance by other means. It may also mean that the vector may have integrated into another area in the <I>Bacillus'</I>s chromosome. <B>Today we shall be adding iodine to the plates so that we can assess whether the transformed <I>B. subtilis</I> can break down starch.</B></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="What_we_did">What we did</SPAN></H3><P>The overnight plate with the <I>B. subtilis</I> growing on it was removed from the fridge (where it had been stored) and taken to the fume cupboard. This agar plate (with the lid removed) was then placed directly over another plate containing iodine crystals (the lid of this plate was also removed). The surface of the agar plate (containing <I>B. subtilis</I> cultures) was directly facing the iodine crystals so that any iodine vapour would hit the colonies of bacteria and the starch surrounding them.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Observations_and_Results">Observations and Results</SPAN></H3><UL><LI> Before the iodine process was carried out it was noted that no colonies grew in square 1. In this square wild type <I>B. subtilis</I> (which has the<I>amyE</I> gene intact) was plated. The reason for no growth was due to it's lack of resistance to chloramphenicol (an antibiotic added to the starch plate). However in the other squares, which contained 'transformed' <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>, there were colonies present as resistance had been inherited.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> After a few seconds of exposure the starch present in the agar plate began to darken and eventually turn black in the presence of iodine vapour. After a minute or so, the whole plate was blackened with iodine vapour.
</LI></UL><UL><LI> When looking at the colonies in squares 2-46 there were no clear halos surrounding them. They were all surrounded by the blackened starch with no clear areas. This meant that the starch had not been broken down around them and therefore the bacteria had lost their ability to break down starch.

It had been previously shown that the transformants were resistant to chloramphenicol, a property inherited from <I>gfp-rrnb</I>, and today it has been shown that the transformants have lost their ability to break down starch with amylase (a characteristic inherited when the <I>gfp-rrnb</I> plasmid integrates into the <I>B. subtilis'</I>s chromosome at the <I>amyE</I> gene).

Which code for:

</P><P>We rehydrated the bricks and transformed E.coli (DH5alpha) cells however we used the wrong protocol and therefore needed to repeat the transformations on Tuesday 18th. We also tested our <I>Bacillus</I> integrations from last week. In a fume cupboard we exposed our starch plates to iodine vapour. No halos could be seen around the colonies, so it was confirmed that the GFP-rrnb had integrated into the <I>bacillus</I> chromosome at the amyE locus.

</P><P>We plan to follow the protocol for <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Project/Labwork/MoreProtocols#Recovery_of_cwlD_spores" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Method A</A> again, however, this time, keeping in mind to add 40ul of our stock lysozyme instead of just 4ul.
</P><P>We will carry out the usual treatment of the spores with lysozyme, buffer solution and L-alanine. However, we will also attempt one extra &quot;treatment&quot;, which is carrying out the same &quot;treatment&quot;, but without the addition of lysozyme. What we are trying to achieve here, is how great an effect lysozyme has on the spores as can been seen in the results section below.
</P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:182px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">The drawn-on sections for the single colonies of the transformations.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Also, we intend to plate out our transformed <A href="https://2009.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Newcastle/Labwork/13_August_2009" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>Bacillus subtilis</I></A> onto starch plates so that we can carry out the iodine test on it to see if it has truly transformed. The rational and steps to carrying out the iodine test has been explained above by the Metal Sensor Team.
The only difference is that our team only plated out 21 colonies; Square 1 contained the wild type <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>, which Square 2 to 21 contained the <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> transformed with <I>gfp-rrnb</I> as can be seen in the results section below.

</P><P>This time round, the results observed seem to be more reasonable as compared to <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:Newcastle/Labwork/12_August_2009" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Wednesday, 12th August</A>, as the control plate was not overgrown with colonies. This is probably due to the fact that the spores were &quot;treated&quot; as per normal, just without the addition of lysozyme. When lysozyme is added, it would disrupt the cell wall, thus it was thought that it would be a critical factor, which has been proved via this experiment.

Observing the colonies growing on the plates, the experiment seems to be a success as the plate with a concentration of 1 has the most number of colonies, and the plate with a concentration of 10<SUP>-1</SUP> has less colonies than the plate with a concentration of 1.
</P><P>The same pattern is observed for the other plates. The lower concentration plates have less colonies growing on it, which can be seen in the following pictures.
