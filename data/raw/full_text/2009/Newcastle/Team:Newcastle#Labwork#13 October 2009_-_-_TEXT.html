Formal Lab Session - 13th October 2009
Today we decided not to characterize cotC+smtA biobricks since we won't have time to finish and we want to finish the lab work this week.
We will do B.subtilis transformation using 3 strains (BFS867, BFS40, BFS2426) cultured yesterday.
Experiment procedure
Preparation of parts to send to the registry
Measured the concentrations of the midipreps and prepared them to send to the parst registry sspB:64 ng/ul
To parts registry: 6.4 ng/ul in 20ul
ara:34 ng/ul
To parts registry: 3.4 ng/ul in 20ul
ara+sspB:87.5 ng/ul
To parts registry: 8.75 ng/ul in 20ul
cotC+smtA:355.9 ng/ul
To parts registry: 9 ng/ul in 20ul
cwlJ:76.9 ng/ul
To parts registry: 7.69 ng/ul in 20ul
sleB:98.3 ng/ul
To parts registry: 5 ng/ul in 20ul
swlJ + sleB:55 ng/ul
To parts registry: 5.5 ng/ul in 20ul
Preparation of parts for sequencing
Prepared the primers for psB1AT3 (x2, prepared two sets)
Forward primer preparation: Total 30ul, 10pmol/ul
Forward primer : 10ul (30pmol/ul) PCR water: 20ul
Reverse primer preparation: Total 30ul, 10pmol/ul
Forward primer : 7.5ul (40pmol/ul) PCR water: 22.5ul
Placed into the box for sequencing parts
B.subtilis transformation
Followed the standard protocol form our lab's B.subltilis 168 transformation protocal.
Added 5ul pGFP-rrnB:kinA vector to all three strains.
Plated the transformed cell on LB+Em+CHL plate
