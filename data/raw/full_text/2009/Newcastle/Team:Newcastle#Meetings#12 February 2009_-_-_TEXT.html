Minutes of the Meeting
The meeting started at around 4.30pm.
Were present: Anil Wipat, Arunkumar Krisnakumar, Dan Swan, Goksel Misirli , Jessica Tarn, Jen Hallinan, Morgan Taschuk, Mathew Robinson.
We discussed about the timeline and our instructors and advisor suggested some points to change or to clarify.
We discussed about the action points of the previous meeting and our instructors suggested that we should assign each task to every member of the team so that on the formal meeting, they could ask the person concerned about the action point.
Our instructors told us how those meetings have to be organised, and gave us information about the organisation of the meetings and agenda/minutes/action points structure.
Our instructors told us about the application for funds and gave a deadline for three members of the team to complete their form and return it to them.
We decided to discuss the ideas for the iGEM project in priority at the next meeting.
We dismissed at 6pm.
