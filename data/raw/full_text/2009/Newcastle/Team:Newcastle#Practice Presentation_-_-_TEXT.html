Press Coverage
At Newcastle University we like to be prepared - so we have arranged to have one or more rehearsals of our presentations with audiences.
The first scheduled presentation is to be held on Friday 23 October 2009 in Newcastle University, and is for the University's Bioinformatics group. Our instructors and advisors are members of this research group.
We are currently negotiating a time and date to hold a second rehearsal of our presentation. This second practice will be at Sunderland University, for the students of Noel Carter; one of our advisors. The city of Sunderland is just a short trip away from Newcastle, by Metro, Rail or Road.
All of this will lead up to the presentation that we hope that you will come to see at the Jamboree in Boston. We hope you enjoy learning about what we have been up to this Summer.
