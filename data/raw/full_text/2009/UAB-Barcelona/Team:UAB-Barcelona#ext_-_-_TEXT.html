We used in both cases Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (PROTOCOL) .
Extraction of N. europaea DNA
To verify that we had enough concentration of DNA to makethe PCR (approximately 100 ng of DNA) we measured the concentration and purity of the DNA (there is recommended that the ratio 260/280 should be major that 1.8) with the Nanodrop. Furthermore, we verified the integritied of the DNA by electrophoresis.
