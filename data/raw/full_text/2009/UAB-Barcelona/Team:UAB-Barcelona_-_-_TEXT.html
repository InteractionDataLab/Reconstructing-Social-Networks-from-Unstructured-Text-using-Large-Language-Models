BACKGROUND
The Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (UAB) is one of the most prestigious universities of Spain, pioneer in investigation and innovation. Our project will be developed in the Chemical Engineering School laboratories, under supervision of the professors Juan Antonio Baeza Labat, Joan Albiol Sala and Pau Ferrer Alegre.  The team will be formed by eight students: three biotechnologists and two chemical engineers from the UAB, and three Pharmacy students, two from the University of Granada and one from the University of Santiago.
Our project will consist of developing an Escherichia coli biosensor that could detect trihalomethanes in water. The idea is to use a protein called GFP, which expression can be induced by these pollutants. This protein produces, after being excited, green fluorescence, which constitutes the signal that reveals those substances. Using E. coli brings some advantages:  it’s easy to manipulate and its genome and cultivation are well-known and deeply studied.
But after long days of testing and trying we realized it was impossible to obtain interesting results and send useful new parts.
So in the middle of September we headed to a new project. In a month we would try to design and build a nitrite, nitrate and phosphate biosensor.
And at the same time, we wanted to add a new regulating pathway based on Nitrosomonas Europaea nirK (a nitrite reductase) promoter and nsr protein. With this system, people will be able to begin the synthesis of a protein with the addition of NO2- to the medium.
