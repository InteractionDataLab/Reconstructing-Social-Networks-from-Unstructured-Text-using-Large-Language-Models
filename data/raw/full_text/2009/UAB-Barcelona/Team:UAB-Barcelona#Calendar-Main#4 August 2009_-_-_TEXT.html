We saw that in absence of chloroform the GFP were induced when it was not supposed do it. That makes us think that maybe the remaining concentration of chloroform in distilled water produces the induction of the green fluorescence protein. To prove that two parallel experiments, one with distilled water and other with milliQ water, are done. The option that GFP could be aggregated forming inclusion bodies appeared. A solution to stop the production of that kind of aggregates is adding chloramphenicol, a bactericide that in low doses inhibits the protein synthesis. To check if that works an experiment with and without chloramphenicol is done.
