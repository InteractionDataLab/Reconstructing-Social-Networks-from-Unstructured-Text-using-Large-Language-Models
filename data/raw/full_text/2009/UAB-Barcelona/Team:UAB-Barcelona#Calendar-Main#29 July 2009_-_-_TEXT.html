We realize that the interesting variable is the ratio between fluorescence and DO, because the greater OD is, the greater GFP is synthesized.
Finding if the relationship between F/DO (fluorescence/DO) and concentration of chloroform exists.
The concentrations studied are 0 μM, 7 μM, 33.5 μM and 65 μM.
