Cuts were done thinking on the standard assembling 10  with the 2-way-ligation.
 
Procedement:
- Take the purified DNA stocks  from the previous Biobricks
- Take the enzimes and add 100 μl of Buffer
2 μl of each sample were  analized on a Spectrophotometer to determine the concentration of DNA on each Biopart.
