About Us
Our group is formed by students and instructors from The National Laboratory for Biodiversity (LANGEBIO in spanish) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The team is formed by undergraduate students in diverse disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biomedical sciences, biothecnology and biology. We believe these diversity is essential for the enrichment of our project. The instructors and advisors are also from different knowledge fields such as mathematics, biology, systems biology and computer science.  The work method of the team was as a workshop and we held reunions three times a week in the first months and then we entered an intensive laboratory work period in an all day basis. The project was mainly coordinated and done by the students. Is only with team work that we were able accomplish what we have done in the project. As an original student initiative we have done the first fieldwork in molecular biology from our university, in order to collect species with unusual molecular mechanisms. This with the purpose of isolating them, characterize them, and try to use them in future synthetic constructions (you could see some photos in the future part of the wiki).
About the project
The project was born at Facultad de Ciencias synthetic biologic group as a theoretical approach of morphogenesis. Some ideas were proposed and developed theoretically on previous igem competitions since 2006 (e.g. oscillators )
For this year students designed a device based on a gene synthetic network based on the lux and las quorum sensing genes and IPTG and ATC quemicals The team develop a modeling and simulation in silico which gave crucial dates about the experimental viability. With people of the Langebio IPN- Cinvestav Irapuato lab we was able to complete the theoretic design an tune up the experimental job.
The assembly of regulation network started at Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM. Later we moved to Langebio IPN-Cinvestav lab to work together.
To now the experimental advance has given us some ideas of how we must corroborate the Turing's proposal of morphogenesis from 1952
We can say that given the nature our team so multidisciplinary that include students, advisors from Facultad de Ciencias, IIMAS and CINVESTAV Irapuato the first synthetic biology Mexican project proposed since 2006 produced great results in the experimental and theoretical field.
On this date the proyect is 95% advance.

Students
Luis de Jesús Martínez Lomeli
Mathematics - Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM. As an undergraduate math student my main interest in synthetic biology is develop biological systems that could give a new perspective about mathematical models (e.g. our project). My main role in the team was design the synthetic genetic network of biobricks that fulfill Turing hypothesis to generate spatiotemporal patterns. Besides, coordinate the whole project, work in the implementation of the system at lab, assist in the development of the model and stablish the colaboration with the LCG-UNAM mexican team. Lot of work! =)
Jesús Pérez Juárez
Biology - Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM. I’m Jesús I study fourth year biology I'm so intersting in live sciences I think is a great oportunity to interdisciplinary collaborations and new aplications, I've realy enjoied the work with pysics and mathematics this summer.
Daniel Isui Aguilar Salvador
Biomedical Research, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Proudly UNAM. I'm an undergrad student on Biomedical Research (whatever that is), and I'm interested in original ways to apply biology. Since I was absent during part of the development of the project my work consisted in some lab work, but mainly I focused on the development of the single cell model and the kinetics implied on it. As well as in synthesizing the project to upload it to the wiki.
Gilberto Gomez Correa
Physics, Facultad de ciencias, UNAM. My interest in synthetic biology is in the posible applications and the extent of them to every area of human action in particular its integration with biodegradation research and with neuroscience. My role in the team was as a multitask member mainly doing laboratory work, modeling in paper and in the computer and helping with the coordination of the project.
José Martínez Lomeli
Physics - Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM. I joined te team because I can see that the synthetic biology is a wonderful place where physics theories can interact with biology perfectly and both can get enrich. My role in the team was assist in the modeling part and help in the lab doing some experiments.
Cristian J. Delgado G.
Undergraduate Biology Student Faculty of Sciences UNAM. work in rare and strange fields for biology, bionanotecnology, biomimetics, biorobotics, biological based devices, bio art, and anything that can be with "BIO",i believe that we dont have to close our view just on one side and turn back again to nature.On night i turn into dj and producer and i enjoy city night life. I love gadgets :D and computers, what else could make weird sounds and music?

Ileana de la Fuente Colmenares
Biology - Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM. I'm interested in designing biofuel cells from modificated microorganisms  with rare metabolisms in relation with biorremediaton procesess  and their implementation in Mexico. My roll in the Turing proyect was as a helper. I reviewed references and bibliography for the bioparts design and their characterization.
