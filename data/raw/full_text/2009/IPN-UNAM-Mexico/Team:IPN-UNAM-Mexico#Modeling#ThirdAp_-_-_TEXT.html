Third approach: Spatial model
Afterward we described as ordinary differential equations the time change of the concentrations of PAI and AI based on the kinetic law equations, being x PAI and y AI
Here all the constants are sums or products of kinetic constants.
With this system of differential equations describing the kinetic basis of the reaction and diffusion we proceeded to make a qualitative analysis of its behavior by creating its vectorial field as the following 2x2 system of equations using Grapher .
From this analysis we can see simply by looking at its vectorial field that it behaves as the system:
We wanted to check if this equations as chemical kinetics into a system of the reaction-diffusion dynamics can produce spatiotemporal patterns; to do this we made a simulation using ComsolMultipysics as previously described
