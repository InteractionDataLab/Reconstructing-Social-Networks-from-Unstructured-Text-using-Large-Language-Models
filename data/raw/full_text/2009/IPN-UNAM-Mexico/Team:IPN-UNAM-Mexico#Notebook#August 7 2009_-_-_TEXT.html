Digestion Digestion using EcoRI :
plasmidicDNA..........3μl
Buffer 2....................1μl     x30
BSA..........................0.5μl  x30
EcoRI enzyme......... 0.5μl   x30
H2O..........................5μl
 
An electrophoresis gel was ran with the following quantities:
3μl marker 1kb
Buffer 2 ................ 1μl.
3μl DNA+ 3μl of colorant
All samples were digested with EcoRI in order to linearized them.
Line 1 1kb | 3.1 ....* 3.4|9.1....* 9.9|9.8..  1|1kb|*18.2....18.4|19.1*....19.4|1kb
line  2 1kb|22.1.......*22.4|24.2”   16.2” 14.1 9.4|1kb
the ones marked with * are plasmids extracted today.
