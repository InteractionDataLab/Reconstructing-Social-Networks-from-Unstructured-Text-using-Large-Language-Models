6 Biobricks were ligated (see 06/08/09) and they grew in the following  plates:
15: 3 lig2 Amp/Kan
2:3 lig1 Amp
2:3 lig2
 
Falcon tubes were inoculated with colonies picked up from the ones that  grew in the plates. We took 2 from 15:13 and 2 from 2:3 with a total of 4 Falcon  tubes with their respective antibiotic resistances.
