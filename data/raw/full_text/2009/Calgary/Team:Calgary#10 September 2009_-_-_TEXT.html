Handout Fun and Lab Meeting
Today Prima and I did yet another draft of our handout as we're still not completely satisfied with the layout.  The lab members of our team also met today to discuss what needs to be accomplished in the lab over the next couple of weeks and who will be in charge of what.  For my part, I am working with Kevin on finishing up the testing of the Mutants/ Reporter Curcuits.  I will also be constructing a reporter circuit with GFP with an LVA Tag as well as a circuit with LuxOD47E controlling expression of the Pqrr4 promoter to add to the registry.  This is important becauae LuxOD47E is one of the few proteins in the Registry that acts directly on a promter, controlling activation.
FAHD
Ethics Paper
Today I continued working on the paper.

Lab meeting
Today, all members of iGEM Calgary who are continuing to work on the project throughout the school year met. We discussed who will be doing what in the lab with respect to the overall project. I will now be working on the promoter library alongside Carol so that this can be done in time for the iGEM Jamboree.

aGEM  Preparations
Emily and I continued to work on the Human Practices poster, powerpoint and hand-outs. We have to briefly discuss the goals, procedures, achievements and future plans of the three components of Human Practices: marketing, outreach and ethics.  Today, we changed the formatting on our handout quite a bit after discussing with the other team members. We added figure legends on the handout and played around with animations on the powerpoint.

ACTION!
Worked on the Second Life movie for the aGEM presentation. It was done using iMovie for mac and I learned to cut, rearrange and use various effects for a more professional look. It's 90% done but adjustments will be needed since presentation structure and content might change.
