MDSC 507 meeting:
Today we had our first MDSC (medical science) 507 meeting. This course is designed for iGEM students and provides an opportunity for them to accomplish the final stages of their summer projects. It also continues after iGEM competition, for analyzing other projects participated in Jamboree.
Completing the paper for the modeling component of the project and finishing up the code will be the most important tasks that I need to do for this course.

Continuation and completion of Lab Poster
Today, Emily and I continued making the lab poster (See September 5). We finished the large depiction of our entire system, building on the response of the system by addressing the application of our project with biolfilm prevention. We finished writing all the text for the poster: introduction, methods and supporting text for all the circuits. The entire poster was properly formatted and was then sent to our supervisor Sonja for her to look over it

Second Life Poster
Revisions for a Second Life poster was completed this week based on the revisions suggested by other team members in order for it to be submitted to the O'Brien Center. I may take some time this weekend in order to look over the poster a few more times, but I am satified with it currently although it will continue to change and be modified since it is far from perfect. Something I am having trouble with is converting to pdf format, which I will continue to try over the weekend.
