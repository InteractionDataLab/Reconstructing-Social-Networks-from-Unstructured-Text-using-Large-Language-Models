DESCRIPTION
NAVIGATIONAL TOOLS
NAVIGATIONAL BUTTONS
The iGEM Calgary project is split into multiple sub-teams. To help keep track of each sub-team's contributions to our project, we've marked sections of this wiki using the following buttons:
In the lab, we've been working to implement our signalling pathway in E. coli. This is our 'genetically engineered machine', hence the use of gears as representation for the wetlab. This green button indicates all contribution and work done by our wetlab team.
This orange button (with a computer) indicates the work done by the modelling team, both for MatLab based modelling and membrane computing.
Through iGEM, we've had the opportunity to explore educational outreach in synthetic biology, and ethical practices within this field. This blue button highlights are work in human practices.
Second Life is a virtual environment in which we've been creating educational tools to teach the basics of synthetic biology. This purple button with the 'internet globe' indicates the SL team's work in this online community.
Our marketing team has been working to raise the profile of synthetic biology in our community, as well as generate funds for our project. Their achievements are highlighted by this red button.
Throughout this summer, we have been fortunate enough to collaborate with many other teams. This yellow button highlights team cooperation, an important aspect within the iGEM competition.
