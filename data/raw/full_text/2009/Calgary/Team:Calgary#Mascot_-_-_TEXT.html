Mr. Super D-Lux
Mr. SUPER D-lux, the University of Calgary's iGEM team mascot, is an interactive bacteria who demonstrates the processes involved in phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the lux proteins in the AI-2 signalling circuit. He is a green figure, quite flexible, energetic and very friendly. He will help you to grasp the concepts in a fun, friendly and simple manner. We invite all iGEM-ers to come check out our proejct and help Mr. SUPER D-lux activate and inactivate his signalling circuit. He is SUPER excited about the Jamboree and can't wait to teach you the biology behind the University of Calgary's iGEM project!
