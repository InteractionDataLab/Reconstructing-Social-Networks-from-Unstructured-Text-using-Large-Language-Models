PRIMA
Sequencing of aiiA-B0015 construct
I sent the aiiA-B0015 construct for sequencing with BBK-CP-F and BBK-CP-R primers (thus 2 samples)from colony 2. Please refer to the restriction digest verification from August 19 to see the cut and uncut band sizes. The size of the psB1AK3 vector (containing the construct) is 4022bp and the Tm is 60 degrees Celsius.
Next steps: If the sequencing results turn out positive, i'll proceed to the second construction (B0034 in front of aiiA-BOO15 in psB1AK3 plasmid). I will get my sequencing results back on Thursday.
Today, I worked on making the marketing and media powerpoints for aGEM and doing write ups for the Human Practices handout. Emily and I designed and made a general outline of the brochure and we'll hopefully finish it up tomorrow.
I also re-edited my Utoday article. I hope to finish that tonight and send it to my supervisors for a final check before publishing the article.
