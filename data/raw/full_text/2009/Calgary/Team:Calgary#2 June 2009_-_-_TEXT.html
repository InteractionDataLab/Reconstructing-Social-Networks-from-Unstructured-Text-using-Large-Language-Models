Marketing and Media for June 2nd 2009
Today, I started filling out funding applications for some pharmaceutical companies. Some of these companies include Pfizer Canada, Merck Frosst Canada and Glaxosmithkline Canada. I did not get a chance to complete them but I am still working on it.
I also set up a TV media appointment with the NUTV news for June the 16th 2009.
JAMIE
Biobrick Vector Isolation and Verification + Sponsorship Package work
Today the iGEM Lab team worked on isolating psB1AC3 and psB1AK3.  Digestion with all enzymes in the prefix and suffix was used to confirm the presence of the restriction sites.
I also spent some time drafting up the sponsorship package for companies.
JEREMY
Isolation and verification of pSB1AC3 and pSB1AK3
The iGEM lab team members worked together today to help each other perfect the method of plasmid isolation. Plasmids psB1AC3 and psB1AK3 were isolated using Sigma GenElute Plasmid Mini-prep kit, and the concentration and purity of plasmid was measured using the NanoDrop Spectrophotometer. See Emily’s notebook for today (above) for results.
In order to verify that these vectors only had the death gene ccdB (675bp) in them, RD was set up with combinations of the following restriction enzymes: EcoRI, XbaI, PstI, NotI and SpeI. A gel was run with these products, as well as products from a RD set up with various genes of interest in their respective TOPO vectors (all cut with EcoRI).
KATIE
Genome Island
I got a chance to finally explore Genome Island properly and went through some of the activities on the island, which contains informative areas on Mendelian genetics and includes quizzes, slide shows etc. There was a tour of the island, a scavenger hunt, a garden containing plasmids as well as a tower with a variety of lab equipment where Mandy was able to talk to the owner of the island.
I am hoping we will be able to make our island more interactive than this, but it will depend on how difficult I find the scripting language.
KEVIN
Plasmid Purification/isolation and verification of pSB1AC3
Plasmid Isolation To isoloate pSB1AC3 plasmid from TOP10 cells, a miniprep on them was done using Sigma's GenElute plasmid Miniprep Kit (sigma). pSB1AC3 plasmids are needed for potential plasmid switches.

Restriction Digest To verify if the biobrick restriction sites are present in pSB1AC3, restrition digest was done using all the different combinations of enzymes:
NotI, EcorI+SpeI, XbaI+PstI, EcorI+PstI and XbaI+SpeI
MANDY
Second Life Teleporter
The teleportation grid now has buttons that turn black, indicating that the corresponding biobrick sphere is in use, and they remain that way for half an hour. Unfortunately, now that we look back on the spheres, it is dificult to have enough room to get all the parts for biobricking into them, as they can only be 10x10x10 in size as a maximum. Today was also our shopping day in preparation for activity materials for the University Campus Fair.
PRIMA
Biotech companies
Today I made an general email which I could sent to all Biotech companies. I had it checked by the rest of the marketing team. I had tailored some of the emails to target companies who had sponsored the building of the O'Brian labs and donated/offered quotes in the past. Since we had established a friendly long-term relationship with some of these companies, I wrote an email specifically to them regarding sponsoring this year's iGEM project.
VICKI
Verification of vectors
Purpose: Check the BBk and TOPO vector tubes and confirm that they actually contain what the labels claim they do.
Materials and methods: 1. The plasmids (BBk and ccdB) came in E. coli. We performed a mini-prep to isolate them from the bacteria, in accordance with our plasmid isolation procedure. We were dealing with both psB1AC3 and psB1AK3 plasmids.
2. We evaluated the DNA concentrations with the Nanodrop spectrophotometer
3. We confirmed the contents with a restriction digest.
Restriction digest volumes
For TOPO plasmids: take 10 uL LuxPQ, 7 uL ddHOH
For restriction digest: 1 uL of each restriction enzyme, 2 uL of the relevant buffer, 8 uL of the plasmid and 9 uL of ddHOH – for a total volume of 20 uL
Reactions (enzymes that were used in cutting and relevant buffers):
Tube 1 – NotI (REact 3)
Tube 2 – EcoRI and SpeI (REact 4)
Tube 3 – XbaI and PstI (REact 2)
Tube 4 – EcoRI and PstI (REact 2)
Tube 5 – XbaI and SpeI (REact 4)
Tube 6 – TOPO with EcoRI (REact 3)
Results:
The restriction digest products were visualised on an agarose gel the following day.
