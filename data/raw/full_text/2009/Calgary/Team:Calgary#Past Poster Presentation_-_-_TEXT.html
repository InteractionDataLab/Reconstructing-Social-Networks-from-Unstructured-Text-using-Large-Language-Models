THE SECOND LIFE PROJECT
Second Life: Past Poster Presentation
The past poster presentation is just that, a virtual space to exibit your team's iGEM poster. All past and present iGEM teams are invited to participate!
If you are interested in seeing your work exhibited in Second Life, please submit:
* Your poster as an image file ( .tga, .bmp, .jpg or .png), up to 1024x1024 in resolution.
* Contact information for your team
* The text of your poster
* URLs for your wiki page of that year
to igem.calgary@gmail.com
The contact info, poster text and wiki URL will be made available to visitors as a text file, to help them follow along the poster and seek more information if they desire. The maximum size of image that can be uploaded to Second Life is 1024x1024, larger images will be shrunk down. I highly recommend that you submit the highest resolution image that you can, take it to the limit if possible.
Please note, we are not asking anyone to submit the posters they intend to present at the 2009 Jamboree! Obviously, teams will want to save their surprises for the big weekend. I would be more than happy to expand the exhibit with your 2009 posters after the Jamboree, however.
Our project, Synthetic Biology Interactive, encompasses the past poster presentation and much more. We will notify all participants when SBI is made available to the public!
