Preparing for Bake Sale and Restriction Digest verification
I helped to do some last minute advertising for tomorrow Bake Sale. I also made some samosas. Tomorrow's bake sale will be held in front of the Hippocrates statue from 11:00 am to 2:30pm.
In the lab, I also performed a restriction digest verification for B0034-aiiA-B0015. NotI was used for this digest. I ran the gel at 90V on a 1% agarose gel.
