SPONSORSHIP
The marketing team has immediately delved into researching and contacting pharmaceutical and biotech companies and research organizations from early May. But to begin marketing, we needed some sort of a document to describe the purpose and goal of our marketing initiatives. Therefore, the marketing team devised a Sponsorship package. This package introduces the iGEM competition, our project, past successes of the team, areas of sponsorship and a breakdown of the different levels of sponsorship. Starting from Community sponsors, the level of contribution from each organization is recognized under the bronze, silver, gold and platinum banners. The iGEM team will give back to corporates in the form of advertisements at the local, national and international levels based on the level of sponsorship provided to the team.
The marketing team has contacted companies such as SNC Lavalin, Nexen and Roche Canada and labs such as Cedarlane Labs and New England Biolabs, only to name a few. Our sponsors were thrilled to hear about this year’s project which could potentially be geared towards the advancement of medicine or assisting industries. This sponsorship package gave them the background information needed to answer their basic questions.
Most companies have responded promptly and informed us that they were unable to sponsor our project this summer. Our sponsorship proposals have been sent to not only the Corporate staff but many Executive committee members. Companies who were unable to support the iGEM team this year will still be updated with our monthly newsletters. A few of our newsletters can be read HERE and HERE . We are hopeful that they will see the value of their investment in the undergraduate science research program, iGEM, next year and support our project.
