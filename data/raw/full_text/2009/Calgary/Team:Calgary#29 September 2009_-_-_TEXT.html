CHINMOYEE
Weekly Modelling Meeting
The nature of the Model was discussed. The attractive diagram view was presented (unfortunately the simulation for this simbiology file was not working.) The rate constants for some reactions were decreased ( GFP production ) and increased for others like ( luxO:P dephosphorylation). A joint membrane computing and differential equations modelling was planned. ( To finally make sure there was cohesion between the two models ; do they respond in the same way ?The rate constants used have to be the same)

Colony PCR of rbs-aiiA-B0015
This image illustrates the results of colony PCR of rbs-aiiA-B0015 The initial denaturation process was set to 94oC for 6 mins, followed by 30 seconds of annealing time at 94oC and 45 seconds extension time for 55oC.
For this PCR, BBK-CP-R and B0034-F primers were used. Wells 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 represent colonies 1,2,3,4,5,and negative control.  The expected size of the construct is ~1.1kb
