TEAM
Today we continued our Biology lectures.  We discussed PCR, Restriction digests and plasmid isolation today...briefly. Again, Sonja used her MDSC 408 notes to help us follow along. We were asked questions and drew diagrams up on the board. We were introduced to Lux PQ, Lux OU and sigma 54. We found out where they exist in cell, how and when each are phosphorylated.  These are all important parts of the system that we'll be building.
Our Second Life team continued to explore the virtual world of Second Life.  They all created avatars (online representations) and learned how truly large Second Life is!  Besides learning how to master all of the basic required skills, such as walking, flying, navigating, teleporting, etc, they also jumped right in to learning how to build things.  They did a building tutorial where they learned how to:
rez (create) different shapes like spheres, cubes and cones
resize, stretch and rotate objects
make textures, colors and objects which give off light
link objects and create bigger things from multiple shapes
Our membrane computing team also had a productive week this week.  They talked about how to start the project. They got their main tool (Mathematica) installed on lab machines and they have managed to gather some great papers on using MC framework and modeling biological systems.  They've started to explore Mathematica and MC in general.
