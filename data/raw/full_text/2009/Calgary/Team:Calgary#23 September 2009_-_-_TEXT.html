USRP Poster Session
Today our team partcipated in the USRP Poster session.  We displayed our Lab/Modelling postera s well as our Secind Life poster.  We also set up a laptop to run Second Life on for people to look around.  We answered questoions and agve people handouts about our project.  We had a lot of fun and people seemed really intereasted about the work we've done over.  This was the first of three research symposiums here at the University of Calgary that we will be participating in over the next couple of monthes.

Lab and presentations
Today we attended the USRP presentations. We advertised our Lab/Modelling posters as well as the Second Life posters. There were approximately 60 students, professors, supervisors and support staff at the event. We answered questions and inquiries about Synthetic biology and the iGEM project.
In the lab, I did a restriction digest today. The purpose of this RD was to clone B0034 (rbs) in front of aiiA in the psB1AK3 plasmid. I digested the insert (rbs) with EcoRI and SpeI and digested the vector (aiiA-B0015) with EcoRI and XbaI. Please refer to the protocol page to view the procedures followed. Following antarctic phosphatase and ligation, I plated  25uL and 50uL of the transformed Top 10 cells on LB agar with Kanamycin resistance.
