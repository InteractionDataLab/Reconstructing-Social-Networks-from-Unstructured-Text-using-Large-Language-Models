iGEM CALGARY ON NUTV'S FULL FRONTAL - JULY 4, 2009
NUTV (New University Television) is a non-profit organization that seeks to provide University of Calgary students with the means to participate in television production. NUTV programs are aired on campus and in Calgary. This year, iGEM Calgary has had the opportunity to appear on NUTV as a part of our 2009 media campaign.  We were part of its monthly show called Full Frontal, a magazine-styled segment showcasing news, art, and human interest stories. The iGEM Calgary segment was aired on July 4th. 2009. This story was covered by the NUTV news Reporter Julie Phillips and edited by the NUTV programme director Justin Hardjowirogo. The news coverage explored the different areas of our 2009 iGEM Team: namely Wetlab, Mathematical Modeling, Second Life (TM) and Ethics.
We also introduced the iGEM competition, synthetic biology, and our quorum sensing project.  Watch the video here, with interviews from Thane Alexander Kubik (iGEM Calgary Team Co-Leader), Carol Chan (Engineering Student) and Patrick King (Second Life Team Leader).
