MAY 8, 2009
TEAM
Today was our official iGEM kickoff with one of our Platinum sponsors, the Alberta Ingenuity Fund (AIF).  This was a great way to meet some of the AIF people that are generously sponsoring our the Alberta iGEM teams this year.  We watched a presentation on iGEM, the experience, the jamboree and competiton in general.  This kind of woke us up to how competitive iGEM is and also gave us some motivation to really get our project in gear!  We talked about the upcoming workshops that AIF will be hosting.
There will be Dragon's Den in May as well as an Ethics Workshop at U Calgary.  In July/ August there will also be a Wiki workshop as well as a presentation skills workshop.  We asked some questions about these workshops and discussed the general timeline of the Summer.  After the meeting, we had lunch and got to informally talk to some of the AIF representatives about our project and iGEM in general and we got to talk to our team mates about the project, starting to come up with some ideas.  The kick-off was overall quite exciting, especially as for many of us, this is the first time we've participated in iGEM.  It looks like we're going to have a great summer of hard, hard work ahead of us!
