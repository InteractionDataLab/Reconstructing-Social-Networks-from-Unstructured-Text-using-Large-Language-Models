VIRTUAL LABS
Introduction
The Virtual Labs will offer learners the full experience of the labs without any safety reagents or safety hazards. It will interactively guide them through many laboratory procedures varying in difficulty, helping students form a thought process about what materials are required, what settings are needed, and what the results should be before users go in actual labs.
VIDEOS
This video shows an example of a laboratory procedure (bacterial transformation) performed by a member of our Second Life team.
In this video, Katie presents some information about scripting in the virtual labs and the lab procedures. Although this video was done early in the iGEM season, many of the scripting methods and procedures are very similar to the final versions.
