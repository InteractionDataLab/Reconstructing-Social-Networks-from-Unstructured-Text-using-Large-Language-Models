Lab Preparation for aGEM
Jamie and I worked on the poster, handouts and presentation slides for aGEM today. We picked out the essential elements of the lab to present through these means, focusing particularly on biofilms and how they fit within quorum sensing. This was good practice for iGEM as we only have 20 minutes as an entire team to present, five or six of which will be devoted to lab.

aGEM presentation preparations
Emily and I worked together to complete the Human Practices handout and powerpoint slides. I've edited the flow charts a bit to make the slides more appealing. I've also written brief marketing summaries and descriptions for some figures on the poster. I'll discuss this with Emily tomorrow.
