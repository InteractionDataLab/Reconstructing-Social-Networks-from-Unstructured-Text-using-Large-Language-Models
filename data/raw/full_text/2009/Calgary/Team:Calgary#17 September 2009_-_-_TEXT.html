SEPTEMBER 17, 2009
TEAM
Final Preparations for aGEM
Today we had a team meeting for final preparations. We ran through the entire presentation a few times, in order to edit for clarity and timing. It was also an opportunity to see how the presentation slides flowed, and if they needed editing as well.
After a couple dry runs, hopefully our presenters will be ready!
