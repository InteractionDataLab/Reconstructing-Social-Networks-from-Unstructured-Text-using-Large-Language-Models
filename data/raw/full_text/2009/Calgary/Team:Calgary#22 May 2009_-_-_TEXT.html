Team Meeting and Dragon's Den Preparations
Today we had a team meeting.  Each subgroup of the project had an hour or so to explain what they've been up to for the last couple of weeks as well as their plan for what they're going to accomplish in the next couple of weeks.  The lab team talked about the PCR and gel electrophoresis we did this week.  We focused on why we did them, how we did them and how we interpret the results (agarose gels and how to read them).
Over the lunch hour we had a chance to watch a few episodes of the Dragon's Den CBC.  This was really good as it gave us a better idea of what our Dragon's Den Team (Jeremy, Vicki and Prima) can expect on Monday.  Selling our ideas with confidence will be very important as well as knowing our stuff inside and out.  The question and answer sessions were very important in determining the fate of the competitors so we need to really stand out during that section of the presentation on Monday.  Hopefully the dragons won't be as intimidating as some of the ones that we saw today!

Presentations and Media Coverage, May 22nd 2009
Today we had our team presentation. Each sub-team of our iGEM Calgary team, had to present what they had so far accomplished. I also got an e-mail form Global TV that they would be happy to do a story on our research project somewhere in September.
IMAN
Visualization of AHL signaling system
In membrane computing, each membrane encloses a region and a set of evolution rules are defined for that region and these rules determine the interaction between objects localized in that region. For visualizing that, we designed boxes that demonstrate membranes. Each box has 3 rows inside. First row indicates the objects inside the membrane. The second row demonstrates the evolution rules for that region, and the third row shows the label of the membrane. The label is used to differentiate between membranes involved in the simulation. The visualization obtains information from the simulation and shows the objects, their transportation and the rules applied to the system in each step. We only need to think of a way to convert this picture wise visualization to a smooth animation.

Presentations & Preparations for Dragon's Den
Friday is team meeting time. This week, each subgroup of the project the opportunity to explain what they've been up to for the last couple of weeks as well as their plan for what they're going to accomplish in the next couple of weeks. We (the lab team) presented what we have learned about PCR and gel electrophoresis, and how we've had a few troubles with them.  The focus for each experiment was definitely the purpose, because we all need to be conscious of the overall goal of the project and where our small projects fit into the big picture. Over the lunch hour we had a chance to watch a few episodes of the Dragon's Den CBC.  I am incredibly excited to be representing iGEM Calgary at the AIF Dragon's Den on Monday. We must sell our project to them in what's called an 'elevator pitch'.  The Q&A sessions will be crucial in securing AIF as one of iGEM Calgary's biggest sponsors.
KATIE
Collision with Objects and Scripting the PCR Machine
Today, I was able to:
Make something that will selectively glow when it hits an object. The object must have a certain name or id. The object can be attached to an avatar, but only to the owner of the object so the only way avatars other than mine can wear it are taking it into their inventory so that they are the owner of it
I began the PCR machine script today (Another group member will make the primitive representation of the machine). I believe it would be useful to see everything in the objects inventory, including the script
For now, if you make a list of things you want you can look for them within inventory by identifying the type of the name in the inventory and if it is returned INVENTORY_NONE it is not in the object’s inventory
Tomorrow I would like to continue with the general version of PCR.
KEVIN
Team meeting
Discussed what each team was up to and what they will be up to next week.
MANDY
Second Life Brainstorming
During the meeting, we got a lot of feedback regarding the types of things we want to show and teach in the different sections of the island. We've been exploring other educational areas alot, especially Genome Island and Sigma Aldrich in order to explore how they go about teaching concepts that are similar to what we'd like to show (lab techniques, molecular genetics, etc.) I played around with some Sigma Aldrich activities in order to brainstorm how to develop activities in the lab.
PATRICK
Early Meeting
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
At an early meeting, got to share some of the ideas I had for the simulator, and get lots of feedback and suggestions from the rest of the team, especially with regard to examples for the Synthetic Kingdom.
An early experiment in binding interactions had produced two objects that would link to each other on collision, becoming one physical object.
PRIMA
Preparing for Dragon's Den
We watched the Dragon's Den TV shows to get an idea of how to present, what to do, what not to do and what we should expect from the Dragons.
We discussed the presentation with Thane and Sonja and they asked us potential questions that we may be asked in Edmonton. I was prepared to talk about the sponsorship package, our plans, successes, goals and budget.
I followed up with a few companies via email and sent out more sponsorship packages.
STEFAN
Continued scripting and experimenting
This week we were at a place on an island called King's Bishop where we could freely build things since we don't have our island. Started just building and experimenting with interactions between objects. I got a whole bunch of freebies by hunting around on other islands and also explored Genome Island. Met some new friends and scientists, most importantly people from Sigma Life.
