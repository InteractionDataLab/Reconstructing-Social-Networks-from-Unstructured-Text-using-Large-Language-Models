CAROL
Financial Plan Completion
Helped team complete the finanical plan for submission
CHINMOYEE
Finish Business Plan
Wrote Summary for Mathematical Modelling and Membrane Computing with Carol for the Business Plan
EMILY
Business Plan Deadline!
Today we divided up the remaining sections of the Business Plan and worked on completing them for the deadline today.  I worked mostly on creating a Gantt chart with Vicki to illustrate the timeline for our project as well as establishing milestones for a few aspects of our project such as the Wiki and Outreach.
FAHD
Business Plan Deadline, May 15th 2009
Today, I worked on the business plan, which our sponsor Alberta Ingenuity Fund wanted as part of their sponsorship deal. The business plan was a tremendous learning experience for our team as it helped us summarize what would be our goals and milestones for the upcoming seven months.
IMAN
Learning about Mathematica and membrane computing
I was busy to learn about Mathematica. Mathematica is a language with powerful built-in functions that could be used for various applications. I watched many online tutorials that are available at Wolfram’s website (the company that developed Mathematica).  Reading papers about membrane computing was another activity that I have done in this week. These papers can be found at ESD.ucalgary.ca.  I also had two meetings this week, one with iGEM members on Friday and the other one with Lindsay members on Thursday.
JEREMY
Team Work
Purpose: Write and edit text part of the Business Plan that iGEM Calgary will submit to AIF. Today was crunch time with everyone from iGEM Calgary working to complete the Business Plan for AIF in order to get one step closer to securing $20 000 to fund our project. Specifically, I help to edit all sections of the business plan and helped to write bios as well. Although most members were quite stressed throughout the day, it was a great team building exercise.
KATIE
More scripting in Second Life and Write-ups
I contributed a bit to writing a description of campus fair with Mandy as well as helping to write up milestones for each month for the second life team. When I had time to work in Second Life I:
Tried to work on getting objects to respond to each other and not just to the user
We will hopefully have a clear idea of what our virtual environment will consist of and will be easily communicated to the rest of the team through a project proposal. We may also show screenshots of what we have done this week.
MANDY
Business Plan Write-ups
For our AiF Business plan, the Second Lifers worked on descriptions of Campus Fair for outreach as well as milestones for the team-wide Gantt chart. In Second Life, I made it through a couple more scripting tutorials in rotating objects and changing their texture/colour when touched.
PRIMA
Business Plan Deadline
Today was the deadline for the University of Calgary’s iGEM Business Plan. Due to some sudden changes in plans and unexpected circumstances, we weren’t even close to being done. I sat down with Sonja to discuss this year’s expenses, sponsors, AIF funding, and plans for carry over money . Jamie and I worked on the iGEM budget, rewrote the marketing introduction and edited the fundraising write ups.  We helped other team members complete their parts of the business plans. The business plan was divided into sections and students from each division of iGEM teamed up to write up each section.
STEFAN
Scripting
Now that we know how to create objects the next part is scripting. Myself and the other Second Lifers have been doing some tutorials on scripting. This involved learning the terminology first: constants, events, flow controls, functions, operators, states, types, and other nerdy words. Progress is slow at the moment as I have had no experience scripting.
VICKI
Business plan mayhem
We did not make it as far on the business plan this week as we had planned to, so today was a massive team effort to prepare this part of the project for Alberta Ingenuity. Emily and I prepared a timeline and worked on a GANTT chart to visually depict our timeline and help assess where stress points might arise in the year. I also helped edit other parts of the business plan.
