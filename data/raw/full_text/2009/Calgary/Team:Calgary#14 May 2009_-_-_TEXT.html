CAROL
Bake Sale Preparation + Modelling Review
prepared bake sale posters
Did further reading in modelling topics
EMILY
Wiki Coding and Bake Sale Posters
Today I spent some time learning how to build tables in Wiki code and I played around with a few.  Jeremy and I also started uploading pictures and the mini-biographies to our Team page.  We spent a long time playing around with formatting, trying to get the pictures all the same size, all the text properly aligned, etc.  We also looked at coding for building a calendar on our Wiki in order to keep track of what various people are doing on any given day.  We decided to make it monthly where you can click on individual dates to get more information on them.
Today I also helped Mandy and Kevin color our bake sale posters for next week.  They look pretty awesome!
JEREMY
The World of Wiki
Today, Emily and I continued our work from May 13 on our wiki page. We decided that this wiki will be the best the iGEM has seen.
KATIE
Getting use to Scripting
Some really basic scripting was accomplished such as learning different methods to get an object to talk and respond to touch. We also read through scripting tutorials from College of Music and learning on the first three levels as well as a scripting display of note cards with sample scripts from Linden Script Tutorial Exhibit, Hyles. Complete objects and scripts for those objects will be shown to the rest of the team next week. I also built a funnel when I had some free time.
We would like to complete the basic scripting tutorials early next week and begin to apply what we have learned using various sandboxes until our island is secured.
We should work on getting objects to respond to some sort of stimulus such as touch (get object to follow avatar if touched
KEVIN
Bake sale poster finished!
Our bake sale poster was finished. Coloring was helped by Prima, Mandy, Emily, Carol and Fahd. Great team work.
MANDY
MORE Building?
While the others began their exploration of scripting tutorials I kept at building for a bit (scripting confuses me). I was able to shape some neat/random looking proteins, some buildings, and some desks. I also helped with the bakesale posters. I started a bit on reading how to script, but haven't gotten much further than changing the colours of floating text and making my object say random things when rezzed.
PRIMA
Fundraising Write-up
Today, I stayed home to write up the fundraising section of the business plan. I discussed our fundraising ideas, plans, and deadlines. I elaborated on what steps need to be taken in order to organize for such events. Do we need to buy anything, make posters, advertise? If so, when should we start? I wrote my final draft, edited it and sent it to Thane and Sonja for a final check.
I began making a calendar to post all the important dates of events, interviews, meetings and deadlines.
VICKI
iGEM team assets
In addition to learning more about the glory of AI-2 signalling, I prepared a document that outlines our team assets. This will be used to strengthen our grant application through our business plan. It was also useful in helping me understand where everyone fits into the project and the very-impressive strengths that we have on this team.
