MAY 13, 2009
CAROL
Continued with Financial Plan
Continued writing of financial plan (specifically the modelling part)
CHINMOYEE
Explored different characteristics of modelling
Looked into definitions for: static performance and dynamic response
EMILY
Wiki Code
Today I spent some time looking at how to upload things on the Wiki.  I explored some help pages about Wiki code and learned how to:
Upload pictures
Add links to other pages
Create new pages
Play around with text alignment
Change test format (size, bold, italics, underlining, striking, etc)
FAHD
Marketing Strategies and Media Coverage, May 13th 2009
Today, I worked on the marketing aspect of our project. I worked on my marketing strategies such as how to approach research & development pharmaceutical companies and oil & gas development companies. I also contacted the Calgary Herald and Global TV with regards to providing news coverage for our research project.
JEREMY
Start of Wiki language
Today, Emily and I jumped into the world of iGEM wikis. We spent some time learning how to build tables in Wiki code and started uploading pictures and the mini-biographies to our Team page. We spent a long time playing around with formatting, trying to get the pictures all the same size, all the text properly aligned, etc. We also looked at coding for building a calendar on our Wiki in order to keep track of what various people are doing on any given day. The main goal of our wiki will be to keep all members and supervisors updated on our work because we are a fairly large group, as well as to inform other iGEM teams and our sponsors about what we are all about.
KATIE
Continuation of May 11th
I built my first chair, learned how I could possibly make a spiral staircase as well as continuing up another level in the tower and learning how to modify an objects transparency, flexibility as well as changing the lighting of an object. A lot of higher levels in the tower are still under construction.
After completing the building tutorials I went to a sandbox in the same area and attempted to perfect building a chair, since the one in the tutorials disappeared after a short amount of time and I never had a chance to complete it. After this I have been spending time:
Modifying the different primitives or objects that come standard with build mode
Building double- stranded DNA with the rest of the group to try and build something useful using our newly acquired skills
KEVIN
Bake sale poster continued
First draft of the idea was drawn on paper. Drawing of the actual poster began.
MANDY
More Building in Second Life
We did some more epic building in Second Life, graduating to higher levels in the tower tutorial to learn how to make chairs and stairs. My orientation of axes is still off, and I'm not quite sure I understand the different world/local rotations, which is something I'm working on. As a group, we collaborated together in building for the first time, working on a primitive DNA molecule.
PATRICK
iGEM in Second Life Begins
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
First gained access to Second Life and began experimenting with what would be possible in it. We would not have access to our island until much later.
I had already seen the usefulness of physical objects, which can be dragged around the world by visitors, and of dynamically linking objects together to represent complexes and polymers. Was also beginning to think about the state feature of SL's linden scripting language, and whether that could be useful to my early ideas for the biobrick simulator.
I had originally thought that the physical objects drifting away would be a problem, and then that the user should do their experiments inside some chamber to keep all the free floating molecules in one place! I later found better ways of controlling object movement.
PRIMA
Opening doors to marketing
Fahd and I began thinking about which types of companies we should contact. We brainstormed what materials we need, how we should present it. Initially we were thinking of setting up one-on-one meetings with companies and presenting a marketing pitch as well as hand delivering the sponsorship packages.
Then our plan was to give them some time to think about our proposal and we will follow up via phone and email after words.
Also we began writing and thinking about the business plan.
VICKI
MatLab acquisition and more biology instruction
Today, we received our MatLab licenses. These include useful tools like optimisation, curve fitting, symbolic math, as well as the SimBiology platform that we can use to model our reaction pathway and run simulations. We also spent some time in biological instruction.
