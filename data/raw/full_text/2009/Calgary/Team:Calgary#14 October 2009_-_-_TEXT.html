OUTREACH at Western Canada High School
Today, Prima and I went to the high school we graduated from to give a presentation about iGEM Calgary. There were about 40 total students there, and they were quite interested in what we presented. We talked about engineering, and what synthetic biology is, as well as the iGEM competition and a general overview of our project. We made sure to emphasize the fact that research does not have to be strictly science; there can be modelling, ethics and marketing also. Overall, we received plenty of questions about our work and our handouts disappeared within seconds. We hope that these students now understand what synthetic biology is, as well as the iGEM competition. Based on the feedback and interest, I have no doubt that we will be having high school students wanting to be part of UofC iGEM 2010.

Western Canada High School Presentation
Today, Jeremy and I delivered a presentation at Western Canada High School. There were 35-40 students in the room and they seem very curious about University research projects. We began by introducing the iGEM competition and this year's project (highlighting the four aspects of the project). Our goal today was mainly to get the word out for iGEM and education high school students about synthetic biology.
We showed them a video of Second Life and explained how this could help them to be more familiar with molecular biology, laboratory environments, the iGEM project and potential applications of synthetic biology. The students enjoyed our presentation and asked questions about how to get involved. We handed out Information brochures to these students. The Information brochure includes a brief description on iGEM, synthetic biology, why they should care, how it may help them and how to get involved.
I am hopeful that we will hear back from a lot of these students as they expressed a lot of interest in the project and the competition.
