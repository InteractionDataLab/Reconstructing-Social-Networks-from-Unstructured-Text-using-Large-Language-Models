CAROL
Modelling Continued
Continued with researching and playing around with functionalities in Matlab and Simbiology.
CHINMOYEE
Exploring Simbiology and Matlab
Discovered that Simbiology is an easy to use interface for modelling systems . Has a number of equations built in that can be used to model the system such as the Chemical kinetic equation , Hill kinetics , Iso-Uni-Uni and the Michealis-Menten equation etc.
There are two ways to simulate : differential and stochastic
There is more than one algorithm for the differential and stochastic simulations.- Implicit/Explict Tau , exact Stochastic , ode15 , ode45 etc .
We will most likely be using Chemical kinetic equations to model our system.
EMILY
Preparation of LB Broth
Protocol: Dissolved 10 g LB broth mixture in 500 mL deionized H20 using a stir stick on a stir plate.  Placed in autoclave when dissolved with autoclave tape over the lid.  Put autoclave on 4-Liquid setting.
FAHD
Marketing and Media for June 1st 2009
Today, I started sending out sponsorship packages to all the companies that had requested our sponsorship. Some of these companies include Boehringer Ingelheim Canada, P&G Canada and Roche Canada.
I also setup a TV media appointment with the CTV news for June the 3rd 2009.
JEREMY
Preparation of LB Broth
Due to the inevitable high demand of LB Broth for the coming months of growing overnight cultures, LB broth was prepared. This was done by dissolving 10g LB broth powder (SIGMA) in 500 mL of deionized H20. This was placed in the autoclave to sterilize.
KEVIN
Preparation of LB Broth for growing overnight cultures
Protocol: Dissolved 10 g LB broth mixture in 500 mL deionized H20 using a stir stick on a stir plate. Placed in autoclave when dissolved with autoclave tape over the lid. Put autoclave on 4-Liquid setting.
No other experiments were done.
MANDY
Teleportation in Second Life
Tried out different scripts to make objects teleport users when touched. The first couple I tried did not teleport people to the right coordinates, but I soon determined that this was because I had entered them in the wrong order (oops). I made a teleportation grid that would correspond to different spheres. I also tried to make it so that people wouldn't have to sit in order to teleport, but I feel like that may be a requirement from what I've seen. I am still trying to figure out a way for the teleporter to remain inactive, or at least show that the location in question is being in use, because we don't want people interrupting others during their biobricking sessions.
PRIMA
Marketing Focus
We began sending out the sponsorship package to companies who expressed interest in our project. We had planned to go visit companies to set up one-on-one meetings to discuss our project. However, most companies wanted to have a look at the sponsorship package prior to meeting us to discuss the project in detail.
I had planned certain days to go meet companies but it didn't quite work out the way I had planned. At this time, I mostly contacted companies via email.
VICKI
Modelling a repressilator
We began to develop basic proficiencies with the SimBiology platform by working on an assignment that Anders prepared. It focused on the Repressilator - a 3-gene system for which transcription of one gene represses transcription of the subsequent gene, and so forth. With this, an oscillitory system of expression has been implemented in E. coli bacteria, as described by Elowitz et al. By implementing a model of this system in SimBiology, we gained a better understanding of the capabilities and computational power of this particular platform.
