Leaving for Banff
Today after classes we left for Banff . We had a poster presentation at the Banff conference center . Our team did well . We had a lot of traffic towards our side of the room. We set up 3 laptops to better show case our project: Second life , membrane computing and the wiki. Handouts were given .
TEAM
On the way to aGEM
After mass printing of handouts and posters, along with some final practice, our team headed over to the aGEM Jamboree held at the Banff Conference Center. The trip was fraught with folding of handouts and final edits to our official abstract, which was submitted to iGEM along with our final track choices.
Poster Session at aGEM
During the evening, we gave poster presentations at aGEM. We gave out handouts, spoke about the four main components of our project, and showed people how to both navigate our wiki and explore in Synthetic Biology Interactive. This was an extremely useful experience in practicing for the poster session at the actual jamboree.

PRIMA
aGEM Conference/competion
After a week of preparation for aGEM, the team was on their way to the Banff Centre. The poster presentation began at 8:00pm  for all three Albertan teams: UofC, UofA and UofL. The University of Calgary students arrived early and set up the iMacs for the Second Life tour, set up the posters and had hand-outs ready to be distributed.  The team members took turns visiting the other teams' poster presentations and made sure that there was always someone by our poster to address any questions or concerns that visitors and/or judges should have.
I also had the opportunity to speak to the analyst from iNOVIA Capital, Laura Montes, who I had met at the Dragon's Den earlier this year. She was interested in the marketing and outreach part of the project and was astonished to find out the progress that the University of Calgary's students have made with marketing, media and outreach this year. I also distributed the Human Practices handouts and addressed the relevance of Human Practices to the iGEM 2009 project.
Later that evening, the team got together and helped the presenters prepare for the powerpoint presentation on Saturday.
