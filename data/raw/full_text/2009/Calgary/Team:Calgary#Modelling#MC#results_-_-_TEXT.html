A TOUR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM
We've reached modelling, the fifth stop on our tour! We've looked in to two different methods of modelling our system: Differential Equation Based Modelling and Membrane Computing. Here, you can explore the similarities and differences, as well as the functions of each method. As well, you can find the results of our characterization of the signalling pathway. Once you're done, we'll move on to the Second Life component of the project HERE .
