Modelling Meeting and Presentation Discussions
For the modelling meeting, we mainly discussed about what both teams need in terms of lab results, so that we can deligate different tasks for different people
In preparations for tomorrow's lab formal meeting, we have prepared and deligated different slides and points that we want to discuss for tomorrow.
CHINMOYEE
The Article / Meeting / Presentation
Today I had to go to a meeting till almost 2'o clock. Then I decided to work on the article . In between there was a mini meeting on Presentation for Friday and making a title for USRP Poster.
EMILY
Meetings and meeting preparation
Lab/ Modeling meeting
We discussed mostly what each group needs from each other as well as getting an overview of Membrane Computing in general from Afshin and how it differs from the other modeling approach we're using.
This afternoon we got together with our different groups to discuss the meeting tomorrow, preparing slides and dividing up who says what.  We also came up with a title for the USRP poster presentation.
FAHD
Another Day in Marketing and Ethics
Today, I worked on the Ethics and Marketing portion of our project.
I started my day of with doing research on some pharmaceutical and oil & gas companies and e-mailing him them our sponsorship package. I also prepared for our tomorrow’s presentation meeting. I also setup a meeting (in-studio interview) with our University Community Radio Station (CJSW 90.9) for next week.
For Ethics, I prepared for our ethics presentation for our tomorrow’s presentations meeting. I also explored Second Life so I can get more ideas of how to hold a conference in the online virtual world.
JAMIE
Verifying pCS26 with Restriction Digest and Preparing for Mock Presentations
0.7% agarose gel of digested pCS26.
The modelling and lab teams also met up to discuss where the two models can supplement each other.  Both the lab and human practices teams (which I am part of) started designing their presentations for Friday's mock aGEM/iGEM presentations.
JEREMY
Moving Signaling Circuit from psB1AC3 into Surette Vector (pCS26)
A restriction digest was set up using NotI for PQ-B-R-OU-B in psB1AC3 and LuxCDABE in pCS26. The goal here is to move the PQ-OU construct into the cloning site of the pCS26 vector, thereby removing LuxCDABE. The vector was then phosphotased, and the solutions were ligated and then transformed into XL Gold and TOP10 competent cells. These cells were then plated on LB+Kanamycin overnight.
KATIE
Continuation of August 5th
DNA replication progress: I need to get the polymerase to move along the strand of DNA, the leading strand is much easier since it actually does not have to detect anything and just rez the nucleotides as it moves down the strand, but the RNA primers will no longer be able to be physical so I will have to use another method.
I made slides and edited video clips and snapshots that were taken yesterday for second life presentation tomorrow for the virtual lab and the synthetic kingdom and the results so far for both domains. There is one video for each as well as some explanatory slides.
Also, some changes were made to note cards and substrings for the construction station since they were initially divided with back slashes and are now divided by spaces, which are not recognized as the note card reader so the substrings had to be changed. Another issue I discovered was that in order to properly secure one section of the DNA extraction activity I will require permission to modify the script in the cartridge since the centrifuge is not unlocked properly otherwise.
KEVIN
1. Sequencing
The construct Pqrr4+B0034+K082003 (GFP:LVA) has been sent to for sequencing with Pqrr4 F/R primers to the University of Calgary DNA Sequencing Facility (University Core DNA Services, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). It has been submitted before 1pm, so we will be able to get the results tomorrow.
2. Overnight cultures
Overnight cultures of Pqrr4+I13500 were grown from the single colonies that were transformed yesterday. These are required for plasmid isolation of the circuit, which will then be verified via Restriction digest.
PRIMA
More sponsor/media/lab
I spent some time looking up and reading out aiiA, B0015 and B0034 and then Jeremy spent some time explaining restriction sites, primers, resistance, steps of construction and where my part fits into the system.
Next, I worked with Fahd to make a list of new companies we could contact for sponsorship but we'll divide them up tomorrow. I have started to research a few that i thought I'd like to contact. I also looked up the contact info for Utoday and I'll be contacting them tomorrow. I sent out the last few newsletters to companies and emailed our Communications/media adviser to discuss few issues about promoting iGEM.
Then the marketing, ethics and outreach team worked together to make the slides for tomorrow's formal presentation! We discussed the important issues, edited, and divided up the different sections among different group members.
STEFAN
Notecards
I started writing the notecards that will be handed out at each station. For example, at the quorum sensing station you meet Squidney Crosby. Once you click on him he will say:
"Help the bacteria glow! Take a bacteria avatar into your inventory. Then right-click, wear the costume and go towards the bacteria."
From this a person should be able to understand the goal of this station, how to carry out the task, and learn something about using Second Life controls (in this case it would be wearing something in your inventory). You also receive a notecard saying:
"Quorum sensing is a way for bacteria to coordinate their actions. When they replicate and reach a certain number of cells they activate a gene all at the same time. For many species of bacteria this is done through a molecule called AI-2, which signals the coordination behaviour when at a specific concentration. Quorum sensing can be very beneficial because instead of a few bacteria trying to tackle a big oil spill, many of them could be doing it at the same time making it more effective!
The 2009 University of Calgary iGEM team is working to build a quorum sensing signaling system."
The notecard's purpose is to give a little more info about the but hopefully still easy to understand. It may build on what someone has done or seen in previous stations.
VICKI
Meetings and preliminary presentation preparation
Our modelling and lab teams met and delegated tasks, so that everyone knows who is responsible for what in terms of coding, data collection and writing procedures. Once that was done, our matlab modelling team went to prepare a presentation (for which I'm responsible for compiling slides and writing the system characterisation section). Our lab team also met to plan a presentation, for which I am responsible for making a flowchart that illustrates the mutant slides.
