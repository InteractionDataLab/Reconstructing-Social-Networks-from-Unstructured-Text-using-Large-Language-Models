Lab Poster for OCSS
Today Jeremy and I spent a large portion of the day working on our Lab poster for our O'Brien Centre Summer Studentship Awards (OCSS).  We created figures of all of our circuits in photoshop and wrote up descriptions of each of these circuits, as well as of Quorum Sensing and our project in general.
Today we also had a meeting to discuss what needs to be accomplished over the next couple monthes and how we're going to split up the work.

Poster for Lab Section
One of the requirements of the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentship (OCSS) funding that Emily and I received over the summer to be part of iGEM Calgary is to create a poster at the end of the summer summarizing the work that was done for the four months. The completion of this poster will be useful for poster presentations at the iGEM, aGEM and USRP Markin Symposium. We began making circuits with photoshop in order to make a simple schematic depiction of our circuits. We also made a few flow charts showing the construction of several circuits including the signaling and mutant circuits. We began writing the introduction and background for our poster, including information about quorum sensing, the iGEM and the objectives of our project.

Beginning the SL Paper
We have continued writing up our paper for Synthetic Biology Interactive, which will guide people through what we have done this summer. So far, we have been working on describing the Synthetic Kingdom and we hope to make videos for the stations shown there as well. We also had our first meeting of fall in order to plan what would be required for aGEM and iGEM, and the posters, handouts, etc. that need to be prepared.
