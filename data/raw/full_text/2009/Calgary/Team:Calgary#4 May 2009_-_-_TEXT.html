CAROL
Molecular Biology Review
Reviewed molecular biology topics
CHINMOYEE
FIRST DAY OF WORK
Looked through the wiki of other team to see what they did for modelling.
EMILY
The Learning Commences
Today we met in our lab for the first time.  We took care of some more logistical questions and started to learn about our project.  We started off with the basics, going back over some powerpoints on transcription, translation, DNA, RNA, etc.  I also started looking at team Wikis from 2007 and 2008 to start getting some ideas for our 2009 Wiki.
FAHD
First day of work, May 4th 2009
Today was my first day of work. Today we learned the basic principles of synthetic biology such was a DNA and RNA. We also did some team bonding stuff such introducing ourselves to other teammates and learning about their backgrounds and interests in synthetic biology and iGEM.
IMAN
Work place assigned in the lab
Great news is that we have our little Membrane Computing Headquarters setup over at main campus on ICT 7th floor. We have the computers setup, on the network, have our account created. Today was also more on getting familiar with the setup and getting know the guys on this side. We also started reading papers provided to us by our mentors on synthetic biology and watched few iGEM youtube videos. Cool beans!
JEREMY
Start of a great group
Today was the first day of work, where I had the opportunity to finally get to know every member of our team. We discussed our team goals and administrative issues. We also started our journey into molecular biology as our supervisors started teaching us some of the basics in the field.
KATIE
Enter Second Life
I was able to set up my Second Life account along with the rest of the Second Life team. I explored Help Island and learned to move my avatar as well as teleport to different places by searching for the specific names of places. I went through an area called Caledon, where I read through all of the posters displayed throughout the island and learned about:
How to manage my inventory
Good areas to start out if you are new to Second Life, which I may have a look at in my free time
How to modify my avatar, although I have not had much success with this so far
KEVIN
Wiki-seeing
Although there were not many teams that have updated their wiki's, including our's, I began looking into some wiki's to see what other teams are upto.
MANDY
Second Life Exploration
Got my Second Life account today :) Ran through a tutorial on a pirate themed island. So far, I learned how to move around, touch things, change my camera angles, and fly. The inventory controls are still confusing to me so I still need to work on that.
