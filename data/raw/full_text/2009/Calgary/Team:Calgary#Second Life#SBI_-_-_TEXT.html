SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY INTERACTIVE
Here is an introduction to Synthetic Biology Interactive, our virtual island within Second Life. SBI is divided into three major components: The Synthetic Kingdom, the Biobrick Simulator, and the Virtual Labs. Below (or at THIS LINK ), you can find our paper outlining the various elements and goals of each region, and the considerations we had when developing each region.
For videos and more information regarding each region, please refer to their respective pages (the links can be seen in the index on the left). Even better, feel free to join us in Second Life and check it out yourself: click HERE to begin.
