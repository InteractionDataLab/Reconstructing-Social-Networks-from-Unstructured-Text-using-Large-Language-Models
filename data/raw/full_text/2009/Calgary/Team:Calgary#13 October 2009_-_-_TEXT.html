Prepping for Outreach presentations
I made the Information brochure for the outreach presentation at Western Canada High School tomorrow. This brochure introduces the iGEM competition, this year's project, applications of Synthetic biology, the goals of iGEM and ways for high school students to get involed. It also highlights some of the benefits of conducting such research projects with other undergraduates (develop leadership skills, become part of a team, building your own project, etc). I am hopeful that we will have a good turn out tomorrow.
