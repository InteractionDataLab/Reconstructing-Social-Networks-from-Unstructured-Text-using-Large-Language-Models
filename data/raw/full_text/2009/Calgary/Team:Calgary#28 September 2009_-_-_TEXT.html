Testing of Model
Ran several simulations with different amount of AI2 added to the system. Saved the images of these graphs in different levels of magnification.  Ran another set of simulations with different amount of LuxPQ.
Results :  The graph changes rapidly in the first few seconds to give equilibrium values .   The behaviour of all the graphs are very similar . Only the level of expression and the rate with which the graph reaches equilibrium changes (but only minutely ).
