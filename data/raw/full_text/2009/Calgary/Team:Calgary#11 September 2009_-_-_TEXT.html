Team Weekly meeting
Disscussed Posters , handouts and presentation . Travel arrangements for Boston and registering/fee payment for igem Jambouree
EMILY
aGEM Preparations Meeting
Today the whole team assembled again to talk about aGEM plans and what still needs to be done in order o prepare for this.  We looked over poster sections, handouts and powerpoint presentatins for each section and came up with suggestions for editing/ improving them.  For our Human Practices handout, we're going to expand on the format slightly with 2 pages instead of 1 so that we can go into more detail and have things look less cluttered.
FAHD
Ethics Paper
I finally finished the ethics paper today.
IMAN
aGEM Preparations Meeting
aGEM competition (Alberta gem) is going to be held next week in Banff. Our team is getting ready to compete with two other teams (U of A and U of L) and we need to work on the ways we want to sell our project to audiences. Today we had a meeting for almost four hours and I believe everyone is now aware what they need to accomplish within this week.
For modeling group, we have to prepare our hands out, as well as materials we need to have on the poster. This part of the project is extremely important, because you want to deliver what you have been doing for almost 6 months in the best possible way. You don't also want to oversell your project. Therefore, the best way will be to choose the most important aspects of your project and highlight them in a way that everyone could understand it.

Preparation and group discussion for aGEM
The aGEM competition is fast approaching (next weekend). All iGEM Calgary members met today for almost four hours to discuss what needs to be done before this conference. Handouts, posters and presentations were discussed/reviewd for all sections of the project. The key suggestion to all three of these things for the lab section is to be more results-based. Theory is important when presenting the circuits, but people want to see what we've actually achieved. We will try and put in data that shows the successful construction of the mutant circuits as well as the isolation of AI-2.

Other than aGEM Preparation: Touch-ups in SL
I was able to start adding to three folders for the virtual lab robots to give to avatars when they are requested, which should contain the materials needed to perform specific activities using the PCR machine as well as restriction digest, phosphatase treatment and construction/ligation of circuits. Most materials are circuit parts represented by objects. The only issue I am facing is locating all of the materials I will need to add to each folder and may have to consult with other team members in order to determine what is necessary for each structured activity in the lab.
I also started looking into a way to complete the second ending for the transcription animation, which I hope to complete by October if the virtual lab does not take up a lot of my time. I am in the process of flipping the DNA replication animation as well so the leading strand travels to the centre and the lagging strand will travel to the outside instead of towards the fork. I only flipped it the other way due to convenience, but in order to be as accurate as I can I am going to be spending a little more time on it.

PRIMA
Team Meeting & aGEM presentation, handouts and posters
Today, we discussed the T-shirt meeting, iGEM registration, fundraising and flights to Boston, and addressed any other upcoming events or issues.
Then we moved on to aGEM discussions: we went through the posters, powerpoint and handouts of each group within iGEM. We discussed the changes that need to be made on posters and handouts and suggested modifications on the slides. All the handouts need to be edited and resubmitted by Monday.
Again, Emily and I will work on the Human Practices handouts. We need to do the following on the handout:
1) Try using a similar format to the lab one with 4 pages, allowing for more content and much more space 2) Fewer jagged lines! 3) Like the sideways titles for sections- maybe use for all of the sections 4) New content ideas: -Wht did we learn from the Campus Fair, what did we learn for the fututre in marketing? What are we going to do in the future for Marketing?, what ethical issues did we examine (just in general) 5) Add the grand total to the marketing Pie Chart! And fix up the text.
We also need to edit the Human Practices poster.
STEFAN
aGEM poster and meeting
Worked on the poster a lot today mostly on the layout, colors and organization. Mandy and Patrick did some writing for it. Then we had a meeting about handouts, presentation and poster and got feedback.
SL Poster:
Bold keywords in the upper right hand purple box
Label T.H.AN.E’s lab (Virtual Lab # 2 ) on the map in the center
Label the ‘Welcome Pad’ on the map in the center
Put the titles and possibly the pictures within the purple bubbles.
Sonja would like copies of the original files used for the Poster.
SL movie:
We might want an extra slide before the movie slide?
Can we take out the appearance of the Notecards?
What about the labels- particularly within the Virtual Lab
Can we hide the Inventory Box?
Cut one example from the Synthetic Kingdom, allowing more time for the other two.
Level-based Biobrick Simulator- we need to show a basic level (1 simple thing) and a more advanced level (something much more complicated) in order to show progression.
Further editing will be needed once presentation is planned out
