First Meeting
Went over expectations and the different teams that are part of our iGEM team
EMILY
First Team Meeting of the Summer!
Today we had our first meeting of the summer.  We finally got to meet the entire team and we talked about everybody's interests, goals for the team as well as initial roles on the team.  We learned a little bit more about the individuial subprojects and talked about logistics for the summer.  It was very exciting to finally get underway on the project!
FAHD
Day One: Duties and Responsibilities of the Marketing Team
Today we had a group meeting where we discussed the different types of approaches that we should take towards marketing our project to pharmaceutical companies and oil & gas companies. We also discussed strategies to gain media and public attention and ways to fundraise for our project.
IMAN
Bridge Between Biologists & Computer Scientists to implement Membrane Computing formalism.
We had our first meeting and we talked about different aspects of a successful modeling team. The fact that if we don't understand the system, we can't build/model it. As computer scientists we need to make a bridge and communicate with Biologist in a common language that both will understand. Also since we are thinking about using Membrane Computing (MC) approach, we have to sit down in near future and define our formalism; how we want to define a cell in terms of symbolic expressions? We have already agreed that our main tool for this modeling will be Wolfram's Mathematica . The main advantage of Wolfram's Mathematica is its ability to work with symbolic expressions and pattern matching. Because we are planning to have an agent based approach with simulating a cell as well as colony of cells, Mathematica seems to be much more suitable over MathLab. However since we have to reinvent the wheel, it is much more work and we really need to think about this and get it right.
PRIMA
iGEM Introduction
Work officially began today. The entire team met in the morning to formally introduce one another and say a little about our hobbies, studies, interests, etc. Our supervisors explained their expectations, introduced the various aspects of iGEM and shared stories about their past iGEM experiences.  We briefly talked about last year's project and saw the posters from previous years. The team was enthusiastic and I knew that this summer was going to be fun, creative, informative and memorable.
VICKI
Welcome to iGEM!
We had our inaugural meeting. Here, we discussed everyone's roles in the project and what the iGEM is all about. It looks like it will be a very interesting summer!
