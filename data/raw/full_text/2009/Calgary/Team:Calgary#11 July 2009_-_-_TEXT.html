CHINMOYEE
Lethbridge Weekend Day 1
Went to a workshop about how to present . Received good advice. When not presenting ( but are part of the presentation ) look at the person who is currently presenting and stand at the side away from the presenter. If power point presentations are used stand to the left of the screen ( because English is read from left to right ) . Preparation is very important. If something in your presentation goes wrong , don't fret over it . Move on to the next topic . It is how you recover from the situation that is more important than the mistake that happened during the  presentation . Connect with you audience. If the audience is already present and your are setting up your presentation during that time , kindly inform your audience of your situation (if appropriate make irrelevant small talk ) .

Lethbridge Workshop Day 1
This morning we arrived in Lethbridge at about noon (after an exciting photo opportunity in Vulcan!).  After lunch, the workshop started with a presentation skills workshop.  We learned a lot of tips such as how to prepare yourself, how to deal with nerves, how to orient yourself to the screen and the audience, etc.  We split up into our teams and created a mini introduction to our project and then we choose one team member (Mandy) to present it.  This presentation was videotaped and then the whole group had a chance to talk about it, give feedback, etc.  After this, we went and refined these presentations and gave someone else on the team a chance to present (Jamie) and we repeated the same process.  This was really helpful as it helped us see some of things that our fellow teammates do well as well as some things that they could improve on.
