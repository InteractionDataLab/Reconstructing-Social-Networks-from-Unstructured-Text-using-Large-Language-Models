TEAM
Today we continued to have our heads filled with knowledge by our wonderful facilitators.  We started to talk about our actual project for this year, talking about all of the various circuits that we will be building.  We looked at some diagrams/ presentations on these circuits and discussed their role in the project (i.e. What each circuit  does/ tests, etc).  Thane showed us a flow chart of the project outlining everything that needs to be accomplished.  Wow, our lab team has a lot of work ahead of them!
Our membrane computing team started on a paper hunting mission.  The went through different databases gathering informatio and finding some great papers to help them out that they've posted on the igem.ucalgary.ca website.
We spent some time writing up mini-biographies about ourselves today, talking about our background, experience, interests and what brought us to iGEM.  Our marketing team (Prima) spent some time editing these and requesting appropriate changes.  These will be going up on the Team section of our Wiki along with pictures when they are all complete.
