Final Labwork, Wiki, High School Presentations, Mutant Paper and Reporter/Mutant Testing!
This past week has been focused on finishing final constructions and testing, adding stuff to the Wiki and getting our DNA ready for shipping.  Earlier this week I finished construction of B0034-LuxOD47E, ran a colony PCR with the B0034 primer and sent this down for sequencing. I also started construction of B0034-LuxOD47E-B0015, however due to a lack of colonies on the plates, it doesn't look like this will be ready in time to send to the registry.
Reporter/ Mutant circuit testing was finished this week.  We did measurements twice on Wednesday as well as on Thursday.
This week I 've also been working on writing more for the Human Practices section of our Wiki.  I've been focusing on some of the research symposiums that we've presented in as well asour collaboration project with UChicago and Illinois.  I've also been finishing up my paper outlining the construction of the Mutant Circuits, which will go under the lab section of our project on our Wiki.
Today I went to William Aberhart High School to give a presentation to a group of Biology 30 students.  I talked about the field of Synthetic Biology, the iGEM competition and the specifics of our 2009 project.  There was also time for the students to ask questions.  For more information on this, please check out our Outreach page!
This evening we had a team meeting where we discussed plans for our oral presentation, finalized our T-Shirt designs and discussed what still needs to be done in terms of the Wiki and assigned tasks to people.  We also made overnight cultures from our restreaks of our glycerol stocks that we will be mini prepping tomorrow in order to send to the Registry early nex week.

Discovery Days
Today, I helped setup our iGEM booth at the Discovery Days event held at the Health Sciences Centre. I also attended the or weekly iGEM meetinga and also edited the program WIKI writeup for the Second Life Ethics Conference.

Movie
Using the new interface many nice results are produced, however as we are running out of time, we might not be able to fit all these results in our paper. Hopefully we will present these results in Jamboree. Currently, we are making a movie which instructs users to how to use this model. We believe that beside the fact that a model should be able to produce accurate and useful outputs, it should  also be user-friendly and informative. This movie will be posted on WIKI under modeling section.
