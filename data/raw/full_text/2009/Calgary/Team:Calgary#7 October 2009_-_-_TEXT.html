Reporter Testing and Bake Sale
This morning I did some plate reading tests of our reporter and mutant circuits.  I measured fluorescence and OD of all 8 overnight cultures, as well as of 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of these cultures after letting them grow four hours after our initial testing (done by Kevin) this morning.
I spent a large portion of the day helping out with our 4th iGEM Bake Sale.  Through the sale of cupcakes, cheesecake, samosas and spring rolls, we we're able to raise another $400.  As a bonus this also gave us a chance to talk to a few people about iGEM and about our project.

Mutant Testing (yet again)
Purpose: To test the mutant and reporter circuits. This is done by (1) verifying that the mutants are functional by testing them with KT1144 cells possessing pqrr4+GFP and by (2) using the functional mutants to test our reporter circuit. Overnights were set up with both mutants (LuxO D47A/E) combined with either our reporter circuit or the KT1144 cells. All the cell lines did grow overnight, however, the results were not as we expected. The cultures that were not supposed to fluoresce (D47A in KT1144) were glowing more than the ones expected to fluoresce (D47E in KT1144). Because we have received this result for a few trials now, we must collectively decide what can be done with the mutant testing to confirm the initial results from August.
