EMILY
Campus Fair
This morning I spent some time at our Campus Fair booth.  I helped set up in the morning and then I was in charge of preparing extra 'Bacteria kits' for our craft as well as helping some of the younger kids with the glue and scissors.  We taught kids a little bit about bacteria, explaining what DNA, genes and flagella were, etc.  I also talked briefly with some of the parents/ older siblings about our project.  It was a lot of fun and it was great to see the kids so engaged!
