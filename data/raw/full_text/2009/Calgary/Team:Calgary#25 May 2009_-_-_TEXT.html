Modelling Readings
continued research in modelling topics
CHINMOYEE
Exploration into Systems biology
Went to papers about systems biology to gain better perspective on methods of how to do  model the system.

Looking at Previous Wikis
Today I spent some time looking at iGEM Wiki's from previous years to see what looked good and what didn't work so well. A portion of our team was in Edmonton today at the Dragon's Den and we were very happy to hear that they had secured $20 000 from the Alberta Ingenuity Fund for our project this year.

Futher Media Coverage: APEGGA May 25th 2009
The Association of Professional Engineers, Geologists, and Geophysicists of Alberta (APEGGA) has regulated the practice of engineering, geology and geophysics in Alberta since 1920. Their Quarterly magazine chief editor was fascinated by our project and he asked me if a couple of engineers from our team would write a news article for the magazine. He wanted a personalized article written by one of our engineers and a couple of testimonials from our other engineers.

Dragon's Den
In the days leading to the event, we prepared a power-point presentation that highlighted our project’s goals and the corresponding implementation plan. After heading up to Edmonton the night before, we rehearsed, rehearsed, rehearsed (and rehearsed a little more) so that we could best impress the Dragons with our eloquent delivery.
We rose fresh the next morning, indulged in the culinary largess of Aramark’s fine cuisine, and ventured downtown to finally face the ferocious Dragons. After witnessing formidable performances from the other Alberta teams, we sauntered up to the front and delivered our presentation. Immediately after the face-off, we incurred their wrath (read: received useful feedback) and were given suggestions on how to improve our marketing approach to potential investors.
At last, it was time to dine on something more than a handful of petrified undergraduates. We meandered to a nearby restaurant and feasted on sumptuous food and beverages scarcely short of ambrosia. We also had the opportunity to feast on something more important: namely, the advice of the business tycoons themselves. We were awestruck by the plethora of wisdom and experiences shared over lunch, not to mention the honour of getting to know the Dragons on a more personal level.
After lunch, the Dragons and students converged in Alberta Ingenuity’s lair to discuss strategies for effective fundraising and networking. It was an open-floor conversation where we had the opportunity to learn from the Dragons and the other teams, free of the reticence that was more pronounced in the morning session. We were also able to address some of the challenges that each of the teams had faced up to that point. The day closed with a feedback session, where the teams discussed the format of the event with the Supreme Commander of the Dragons, Ms Jen Hill.

A Continued Tour of Education in Second Life
Continued visiting other areas in Second Life for inspiration and networking purposes. We've come up with some ideas for things like 'moving tours' of areas on the island, Heads Up Displays to show instructions for activities, and numerous other things. In addition, building has continued in Kings Bishop, and I've made whiteboards and more boxes/misc. for the lab. Sigma Aldrich labs have been an inspiration in how to use textures and prim shapes to build 'modern lab' type pieces.
