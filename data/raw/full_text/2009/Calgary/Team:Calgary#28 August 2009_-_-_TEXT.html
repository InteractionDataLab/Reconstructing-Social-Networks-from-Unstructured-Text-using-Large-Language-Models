Summer Vacation
These days we are getting some days off, but I am pretty sure that everyone keeps thinking about what they want to accomplish when they are back...

Designing an SL Poster and Revision
I spent this week working on a Poster for Second Life and the island that the team worked on in order to satisfy the conditions of the funding I was given to work with the Calgary iGEM team this summer. It includes an introduction I was able to finish two different drafts of the poster with comment from other team members. It will be submitted early next week and also be used as a starting point for the Second Life section of the poster for aGEM.
One of the first tests was performed so I went through the critiques that Jaime made for two of the activities in our virtual lab and started to make some changes to bacterial transformation. Some confusion may have been caused by not having access to the notecards made explaining the processes since some things are specific to 2007 wiki protocols and now I believe it might be more appropriate to change them to how people in the lab are doing things this year. Things like resetting permissions on objects so they stay in your inventory are simple to do and I have done so on all objects that I had permission to.  I was having difficulties initially with the changes I made to the bacterial transformation script and I kept getting a runtime error so I was made to use an older version of the script and begin making changes again that did not contribute to the error.
I believe I will change the textures used on the petri dishes, which were used since they do not show any colonies. Other than that I am relieved that more serious issues with the activities did not arise, which hopefully means less modification to be done. Changing wordings and explanations are easy so it does not trouble me.
