UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY iGEM TEAM'S SECOND LIFE IN UTODAY - SEPTEMBER 18, 2009
"UToday is the University of Calgary’s daily online news source, published by External Relations. Created in September 2008, UToday offers the day’s top news, research discoveries and key events. Every day U of C researchers, staff and students make the news locally, nationally and internationally. It is a connection and engagement tool designed to help readers feel more connected to the university community and provide the information on ways to get involved in campus and activities. It’s our goal to ensure the campus community has the most up-to-date information as possible."[1]
Our work in Second Life has been featured today in our University's online magazine, UToday! To check out the article, click HERE .
