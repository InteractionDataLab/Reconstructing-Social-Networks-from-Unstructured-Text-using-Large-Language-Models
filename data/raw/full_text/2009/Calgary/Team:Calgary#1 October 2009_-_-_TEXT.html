Looked for Species structure images
To produce a visually appealing Reactions diagram( which shows the relationship between the species in the Model) , I searched for structure images of proteins in pdb. I found quite a few of the protein structures but unfortunately couldn't find the picture of protein in their phosphorylated form . Therefore I decided just to place an image of a phosphate beside the protein to signify phosphorylation. I also wondered if credits should be given for the images and how to go about doing it best . I couldn't find a 3D image of AI2 so I decided it was best to use a 2D image.

BHSC Research Symposium
Tonight Mandy and I presented our project at the BHSC Research Symposium.  Mandy presented the Second Life video while I presented Intro, Lab, Modeling and Human Practices.  After the oral presentation, we also participated in the Poster session with two of our posters.  We set up a demo of Second Life on on one of our computers and let people look around at our Synthetic Kingdom.  This symposium was really good because it gave us the chance to show our work to many of our peers in Health Sciences.  This was also more practice presenting, answering questions and explaining about our poster, which is important as the iGEM Jamboree is just around the corner.

BHSC Symposium presentation
Today we were one of the 5 groups to present our summer project at the symposium. Reception was great and everyone seemed to enjoy our presentation! I presented the Second Life portion and also was at the posters that we set up afterward to give further information to people who were interested. It was great practice for the iGEM poster sessions.
