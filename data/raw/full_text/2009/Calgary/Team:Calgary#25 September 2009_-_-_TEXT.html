Post aGEM Team Meeting
Today we had a team meeting to discuss our feedback on the aGEM competition.  In attendance was Jennifer Hill from Albert Ingenuity, one of our platinum sponsors who organized the aGEM.  We talked about the positive aspects of the competiton as well as some suggestions for improvements for next year.  We finished off by taking some team photos with Jenn and our trophy form aGEM.

Reviewing the aGEM competition
Today we had a meeting with Jennifer Hill and she handed back the reviews we have received form the judges at aGEM competition. These reviews are very constrictive and now we know much better how we have to get prepared for the main competition (iGEM).
In regard to the modeling group, we have to focus to emphasizing the qualitative abilities of our model. We need to make sure that our audiences know that this modeling approach can be used to model any biological systems that could be defined by compartments and interactions (it is really hard to find any biological systems that do not have any compartment (such as membranes) and  interactions). We also need to insure that we demonstrate the features available in our framework, such as the nice interface we have which makes it very user-friendly as well as various results that it can produce. The good news is we are the winners of aGEM and we still have time to work on our projects to make them even better.

Review of aGEM
Alberta Ingenuity's very own Jen Hill came to visit today with the entire team, and we discussed the aGEM competition. We talked about things that we had done quite well, and things that we need to improve on for aGEM. The largest improvement can be made with respect to finding a 'link' between the four aspects of our project to make sure this is clear. SecondLife must also be a point of great emphasis when we are at aGEM because of the impact it will surely have in the field of educational technology with respect to Synthetic Biology.

Follow-up of aGEM
This week there was a meeting to review aGEM, which was a successful precursor to the actual iGEM competition in Boston. It was useful to become more comfortable in that sort of environment, but on a small scale before being faced with the stress and the pressure that will most likely be placed on the team at MIT. It was also a good opportunity to learn about the different approaches the other teams in Alberta are taking for their projects, which contrast to ours quite a bit and it serves to provide some focus as to what needs to be improved and completed before the international competition.
During this time, I also discovered that the PCR script in the second lab was an older version that the one in the first lab so I have spent some time looking over it and testing a few parts of the script once it had been altered to mirror the functional PCR machine.
