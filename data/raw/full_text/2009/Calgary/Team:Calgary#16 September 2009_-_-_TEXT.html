Presentation Practice
The presenters for the aGEM jamboree met to go over slides and content. Facilitators were also present to provide feedback. After working through the lab slides, we decided to condense some of the content due to time constraints and because the scientific knowledge of the judges at the aGEM will not be equal to that of the judges at aGEM (The judges are all engineers and business people). I was also able to see how the other aspects of the project fit into the presentation and I'm quite excited to see how the four aspects to our project will be received.
