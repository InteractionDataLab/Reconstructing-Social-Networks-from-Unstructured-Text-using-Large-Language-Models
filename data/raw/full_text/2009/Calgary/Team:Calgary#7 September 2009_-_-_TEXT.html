Preparations for aGEM - Powerpoint, Poster, Presentation, and Handouts
Today, we began preparing materials for aGEM. Stefan began filming the videos for each region to be used in the presentation. We chose what parts what highlight within 5 minutes. Stefan learned how to use the Snapz ProX and iMovie programs to create a movie was visually appealing.
After deciding what critical points would be displayed on the poster and in the presentation, we also decided what supplementary information could be put in the handouts, including a better description of Second Life and virtual education. Mandy started working on this handout, using part of a template designed by Patrick.
