Mutant and Reporter Circuits Testing
Purpose: To test the mutant and reporter circuits. This is done by (1) verifying that the mutants are functional by testing them with KT1144 cells possessing pqrr4+GFP and by (2) using the functional mutants to test our reporter circuit. Overnights were set up with both mutants (LuxO D47A/E) combined with either our reporter circuit or the KT1144 cells. Not all lines grew overnight, but we practiced the protocol of trying to measure Optical Density and Fluorescence. This procedure will prove quite difficult as the serial dilutions (1:10 and 1:100) must all be done and measured for fluorescence in under 20 minutes as these cells will divide again.
We also made more plates for the rest of the lab work prior to iGEM
