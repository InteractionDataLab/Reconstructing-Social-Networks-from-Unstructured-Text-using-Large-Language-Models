OUR BLOG
Synthetic BLOGology was an online blog set up on June 23, 2009. It provided an opportunity for us to share our work with other team members and the rest of the world! We have received some great comments on our actual blog and our youtube videos. This blog is updated daily, in the days leading up to the iGEM competition. Generally, we follow this schedule in our posting topics:
Monday: Modelling
Tuesday: Second Life
Wednesday: Lab
Thursday: Marketing
Friday: Human Practices
All of the blog posts/videos can be found in their respective sections of the wiki, but the most recent posts can also be read here. The blog can also be read at the original blogspot site HERE .
