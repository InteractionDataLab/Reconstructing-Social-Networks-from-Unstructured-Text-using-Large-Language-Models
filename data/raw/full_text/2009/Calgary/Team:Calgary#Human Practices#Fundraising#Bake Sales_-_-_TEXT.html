FUNDRAISING THROUGH BAKESALES
In order to successfully carry out the wetlab experiments and fund other aspects of the iGEM project, nearly $100 000 needed to be raised. Strategic marketing efforts combined with fundraising initiatives.
While most of the funds are expected from corporate sponsors, the marketing team has also organized events such as bake sales to raise additional money. Over the course of the summer, we held four bake sales where the team members baked delicious treats such as samosas, spring rolls, cupcakes, muffins and sold them at the O’Brien Health Science Centre. When our peers, professors and staff of the Health Science Centre came to our sale, we had the opportunity tell them about iGEM and our efforts of building a synthetic biology community in Alberta. We also gave out our monthly newsletters at the event. We raised over $1 500.00 just in bake sales. The team is planning another final sale on Tuesday, October 27th, 2009, the week of the iGEM Jamboree. We are hopeful that we will raise over $500 dollar net profit from it. These fundraising activities and events are being carried out immediately while the team is looking ahead towards more efficient and effective investment plans.
