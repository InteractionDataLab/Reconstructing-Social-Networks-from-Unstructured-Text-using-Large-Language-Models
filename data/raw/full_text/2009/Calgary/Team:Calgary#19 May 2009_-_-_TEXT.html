CAROL
Making LB Plates
LB plates with different types of antibiotics (Ampicillin, Kanamycin, and Chloramphenicol) were made.
EMILY
LB PLates and Our First Bake Sale
Today we learned how to, and prepared and poured A,K,C,AC and AK plates.
Today was alos our first ever bake sale and our whole team took part selling baked goods and samosas downstairs.
FAHD
Cultural Bake Sale, May 19th 2009
Today, I organized our first ever iGEM Cultural Bake Sale. We had baked samosas, spring rolls, muffins, cupcakes, cookies and a lot of other stuff. The event managed to raise 287 dollars in total. The entire marketing and iGEM Calgary team did a fabulous job at organizing the event and contributed whole heartedly to this amazing event.
JEREMY
Bake Sale and Practicing Lab Techiques
Today was iGEM Calgary's first bake sale. We had cinnamon buns, cheesecakes, samosas, cookies and the list goes on. We were in a busy spot in the Research Building and were able to raise $286.21. Not only were we selling food to researchers throughout our facility, we were getting the word out about iGEM and learned a lot about what we should do for the next bake sale, including a hand out about our research.
KATIE
Linden Scripting Language Wiki
Looked at the second life wiki for the first time and first tried out:
Moving something (floating) – changing something’s state, resetting the object (function to stop floating)
Changing colour over time
Notecard giver and avatar name storage/detection
Landmark welcome
The purpose of doing this was to become acquainted with the scripting language and not to test its capabilities since these activities were all pretty simple. Since lab equipment has started to be built, I believe I will begin planning out how to bring functionality to this equipment.
KEVIN
Bake sale!
Although didn't help much, was forced to stay there.
Lab techniques
Ran a trial Plasmid isolation to get some experience in lab.
MANDY
Bake Sale
Our first bakesale was a great success! It was great seeing all the people come buy our food and being able to tell them about our project. In Second Life, we found a lot of freebie in tutorial areas, so that we could take them apart and examine how they were built/scripted in order to get some inspiration and ideas of how we want to structure things for our own island.
PATRICK
Early SL Exploration
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
I spent much of the day trying to understand a free elevator object and its script, that Mandy found.
All of the SL team's work was conducted in public sandbox areas, until we got our own island to play around in.
Also located a compilation of prebuilt Second Life scripts .
PRIMA
First Bake Sale
Today was iGEM Calgary's first bake sale. The team divided up the task of baking goodies. We met up at Emily's house yesterday to bake cupcakes, muffins, cakes and much more. We also had cinnamon buns, cheesecakes, samosas, cookies and the list goes on. I booked the Hippoccrates site the week before. I had to be at the sale all day, heating up food, handing out the goods and keeping track of the float. I also helped to clean up at the end of the event. we successfully raised $286.21.
We also took a lot of group pictures to put up on the wiki.
