ARTICLES
Published articles about our project were one of the ways in which we could establish a campus-wide presence at the University of Calgary. Here are a couple links to some of the articles written about our team:
The UToday article found HERE discusses the multidisciplinary team that comprises this year's iGEM team. Undergraduate students from the faculties of Medicine, Kinesiology, Computer Science and Engineering have worked together to construct the AI-2 signalling circuit to target biofilms.
An article was published on the University of Calgary's Research in Action newspaper after the team successfully won the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (aGEM) competition. The article can be found HERE .
Our University newspaper is known as the Gauntlet, and we had a story published there early on in the summer. To read the Gauntlet article, click HERE .
