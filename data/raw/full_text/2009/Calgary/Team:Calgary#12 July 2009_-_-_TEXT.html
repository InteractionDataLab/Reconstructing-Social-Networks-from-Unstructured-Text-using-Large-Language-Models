Lethbridge Workshop Day 2
Went to the workshop about fundraising. Companies donate money primarily because they are asked to not because of tax breaks . It is important to create a long term relationship with your donors.

Lethbridge Workshop- Day 2
This morning I attended a Wiki workshop.  We got some tips on color choices and organization and looked at some websites that do a good job of this (Facebook for example).  Afer this we had some time to work on our Wikis and get help from the instructor (Jesse Johnstone) as well as from other teams.  For example, we were able to give U of L some help linking their pictures.  We got some contact information from Jesse, which will be very helpful down the road should we run into difficulties.  All in all this was a great weekend put on by AIF.  We got some really good information on presentation skills, marketing and Wiki design and we got another chance to meet some of the members from the other Alberta teams.
