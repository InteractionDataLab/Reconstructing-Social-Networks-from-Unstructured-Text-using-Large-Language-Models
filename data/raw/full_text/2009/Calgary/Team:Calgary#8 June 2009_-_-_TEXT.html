CAROL
Isolation of luxCDABE plasmid via miniprep kit
Attempted to isolate a higher concentration of plasmid via miniprep kit (Both Qiagen and Sigma).
A higher concentration is required for sequencing purposes
No success in isolation, may need to consider other techniques
CHINMOYEE
MatLab's other packages
Explored MatLab's other packages :
Bioinformatics : Sequence Viewer , Phylogenetic tree tool , Molecule viewer , Multiple Sequence alignment Viewer , Protein Plot Tool
Curve Fitting : Surface fitting , curve fitting  Genetic Algorithm and Direct Search Optimization  Statistics Simbolic Math
Molecule Viewer : Very interesting . 3D viewing of molecules from data base . Unfortunately can't create images with tool .The Molecule viewer file (pdb) contain large amounts of information on positioning among other things such as name of elements in molecule.  The viewer allows for viewing in many different formats such as ribbon and rocket etc . Can load pic as pdf.
Curve Fitting : Very helpful .
Went through Three Gene Repressilator example modeling tutorial .
EMILY
Overnight Cultures, Restreaks and Ethics Papers
Prepared overnight cultures of LuxOD47E BBK in order to isolate plasmid tomorrow. Also prepared restreaks. Started to look at an Ethics paper called Synthetic Bioethics and took some notes.
JEREMY
Overnight cultures and restreak of TOP10 cells transformed with pBluescript
Overnights of TOP10 cells with pBluescript were grown in LB broth + Ampicillin in order to increase the number of plasmids for future verifications of competency (after isolation). TOP10 cells transformed with pBluescript were restreaked on LB agar + Ampicillin plates.
KEVIN
Overnight growth and restreak of TOP10 cells with pBluescript plasmids.
Overnight Growth
Overnights of TOP10 cells with pBluescript plasmids were grown in order to perform miniprep on them. More pBluescript are required for later verifications.
Restreak
After performing a transformation, restreaking is always required to ensure that you have more of the colony that you are working with; thus a restreak of TOP10 cells with pBluescript plasmids was done.
MANDY
Second Life - Building the Lab
Started construction of the first virtual lab building on the purple island. After taking numerous photos of the lab, we built more test tubes, racks, pipette holders, etc. The photos from the lab have been resized and reformatted for SL uploading, now we just need more Linden dollars to put them up.
As an aside, worked on the menu for the wiki. We want a drop down menu that has further links than the one currently given to us on the iGEM, as a method of greater organization.
PRIMA
Marketing Coninuation
Fahd and I made up a new list of Biotech companies and labs whom we could contact for sponsorship. We began looking through catalogs in the lab office to see from which companies we buy reagents, equipment, tips, pipettes etc. If we found an unfamiliar name, we wrote it down and researched that company to get a better understanding of their product and/or service. If their goal coincides with this year's project we would contact the company and send them our sponsorship package. This second list of companies included 26 new organizations and companies, which could mean more potential sponsors!
VICKI
Further work on the repressilator
I completed the differential modelling sections of the assignment and wrote code to automate the process by running my script at the command line level. I now have a better understanding of the simulation power of SimBiology.
