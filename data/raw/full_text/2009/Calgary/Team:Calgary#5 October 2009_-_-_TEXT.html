Weekly Modelling Meeting
This meeting was a really long one ( 3 hours ) . A comparison between between Membrane computing values and Matlab interface values were made. The units of the k values was discussed. The size of the Kdegradation of GFP was confirmed through calculation.  There was a question about what infinity meant when placing initial values : Should the Constant value option in Matlab be used or Should the infinity mean a large value in comparison to to the other values ie 100 units etc.
Can Membrane computing interface produce similar results as the Matlab model when only one cell is simulated.
The Model Summary( version 4.0) was presented again so that intial values and parameter values could be passed between the two teams.
A new problem in the Differential equation model was detected. The system doesn't seem to have a saturation point for AI2 . The GFP level in the graph always decreases faster with more AI2 is added to the system .  Possible reasons for this :  A few values of parameters are not in the correct order. That is the nature of the model . It can't doesn't have a saturation point .
A new meeting to resovle the possible faulty value for the parameters was planned for Thursday at 4pm.

Lab Work Continues
This morning I ran gels of my 2 colony PCR's as well as of my verification digest from Saturday.  See gel photos below.
Because of these results, I also started to reconstruct R0040-I13502, doing a constriction digest with XbaI, EcorRI, an SpeI.  I left this to digest overnight.

Mutant Testing (again)
Purpose: To test the mutant and reporter circuits. This is done by (1) verifying that the mutants are functional by testing them with KT1144 cells possessing pqrr4+GFP and by (2) using the functional mutants to test our reporter circuit. Overnights were set up with both mutants (LuxO D47A/E) combined with either our reporter circuit or the KT1144 cells. All the cell lines did grow overnight, however, the results were not as we expected. The cultures that were not supposed to fluoresce (D47A in KT1144) were glowing more than the ones expected to fluoresce (D47E in KT1144). Because of this, we went back to look at all of the plates and identified new cell lines that we should use and ones that we should repeat.
