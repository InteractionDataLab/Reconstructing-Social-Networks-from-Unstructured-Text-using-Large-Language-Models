Handouts Revisited
Today we spent some time making changes to our first handouts as we talked about in our team meeting on Friday.  Prima and I played around a lot with formatting and trying to make things more organized and less cluttered.

MANDY & STEFAN
Editing aGEM Materials
After gaining feedback on Friday, we modified our movie, poster, and handout. Stefan made the movie into three parts, for ease of presentation (timing points). The biobricking part was also made more clear. He also edited our section of the poster (formatting). More information about each region was added to the handout, using Katie's OCSS poster for inspiration. As well, Mandy edited the formatting of this handout.

PRIMA
Editing Handouts
Emily and I edited the content of our handout. Mostly, we played around with the formatting to see whether or not a background picture would look nice, what colors, font and style looked more appealing, size of pictures, borders etc. We met in our breaks and after classes to complete the handout and submit it to our facilitators by 7:30 pm.
With regards to travel, I was facing some last minute flight change requests and problems. However, I worked with Uniglobe to work around the issue and get back on track.
