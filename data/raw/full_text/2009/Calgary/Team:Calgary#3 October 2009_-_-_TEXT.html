Some Weekend Labwork!
This morning Carol and I came in to do some labwork: * Because many of the restreaks necessary for the reporter and mutant testing were unsuccessful, we decided to retransform the necessary circuits into competant cells.  We transformed pBluescript (our negative control) into TOP 10 Cells, J13002-LuxOD47E-B0015 into KT1144 cells and Reporter cells, J13002-LuxOD47A-B0015 into KT1144 cells and Reporter cells, as well as the reporter circuit (Pqrr4+GFP) into TOP10 cells.  We plated these on their respective plates and left in the incubator for overnight growth *We did a miniprep of the overnight cultures from yesterday (B0034-LuxOD47E, B0034-K082003 and R0040-I13502) and set up a verifcarion of these cultures using NotI. *We also set up and ran a colony PCR of B0024-LuxOD47E, B0034-K082003, and R0040-I13502).
