Financial Plan
Helped team write up descriptions for modelling for financial plan.
CHINMOYEE
Robustness
Looked into different ways that Robustness could be represented:  Temporal logic formulas , boolean , baysian , Stochastic
EMILY
Overview of our Project
Today we continued talking about the project this year, starting to go more in depth into some of the procedures that the lab team will be working on this summer (restriction digest, PCR, Gel Electrophoresis, etc).  We focused particularly on Jeremy's circuits (the Mutants) and how they fit into the project
Today we also talked about the kick-off and our impressions of it.  For those of us who have never participated in iGEM before, it was a chance to get a better idea of the scale and atmosphere of the Jamboree.  We all agreed that there is a lot of work to be done, but we are up for the challenge, and it's going to be a challenge.
FAHD
Our iGEM project for 2009, May 11th 2009
Today, I learned information about what our project is this year and how it differs from last year. I learned information about the AI-2 and AHL signaling system. Other than that, I worked on the marketing aspect of our project. I found some media contacts that would give news coverage to our University of Calgary iGEM team and also looked up some pharmaceutical companies that would sponsor our University of Calgary iGEM team.

Building Tutorials
Our group first worked on orienting themselves within the second life interface including starting in-world tutorials for building with primitives. The manipulation of primitives was carried out within Ivory Tower, which was a walk through tutorial that taught us about all the possibilities within the edit option. This includes:
Modifying the different primitives that most items in Second life arise from such as changing their position, size and rotation
Changing a primitive’s colour and texture
So far the tutorials I have gone through on the base floor have just taught me really basic building skills and I have yet to make anything useful and I will continue to the upper floors of the tower for more instruction tomorrow. I would like to begin the basic scripting tutorials sometime this week and begin to apply what we have been learning using various sandboxes until our island is secured.

Bake sale poster
Began drawing some ideas on paper.

Building in Second Life
After learning more about last year's projects (AI-2 and AHL signalling pathways), the Second Life team ventured into a building tutorial that Patrick found, known as the Ivory Tower of Prims. After completing the first two levels, we are able to assemble some basic pieces of furniture, and texture them, etc. Stefan made this great glowing couch.
PRIMA
More Biology
I began looking at different pharmaceutical companies, lab and research and development organizations who may be interested in sponsoring our project. I researched these organizations and began making a list on gmail document to keep track of my work. I organized it by: Name of Company, Contact information, Contact position, form of contact, next steps, and contribution.
When my supervisors came in, we went more in depth with biology (Lux PQ, Lux OU, sigma 54 etc).
VICKI
Outreach initiatives with Western Canada High School
Today, Thane, Sonja and I ventured down to Western Canada High School to meet with the curriculum leader of their science department. We are preparing a week-long summer camp for strong, motivated high school students to try to get them interested in synthetic biology. She is very interested and we will try to work through the CBE red tape to make this initiative happen.
