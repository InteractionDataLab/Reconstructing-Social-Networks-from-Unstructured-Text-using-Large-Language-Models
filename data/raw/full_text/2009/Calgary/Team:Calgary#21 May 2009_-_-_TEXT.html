CAROL
Verification of amplification of luxCDABE from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Prepared 0.7% Agarose gel
Used orange G dye
Ran gel at 90V for 90 minutes
RESULTS:
From the results, there is contamination in the negative control, but it did amplify the 6KB LUXCDABE. The large bands is a result of loading too much DNA.
EMILY
Visualization of PCR Product
This morning we had WHMIS training on Main Campus.
This afternoon our lab team members visualized our PCR from yesterday.  We learned how to prepare agarose gels, load gels and visualize them in the G-Box.  See photo of gel below.  Lanes 1-4 is Kevin's Pqrr4, lane 5 is Kevin's negative control, lanes 6-7 are left blank, lane 8 is a negative control and lanes 9-12 are LuxOD47E colony 2.
File:2009 05 21Pqrr4 LuxOD47E.jpeg
Analysis: It is good that the negative control is clean as this indicates that there is no contamination.  The presence of bands also indicates that we were able to amplify something, also good!  It looks like LuxOD47E is likely there, as we see band around the expected size of 1.4 kb, however the lanes appear to be overloaded with DNA, so it is not conclusive.  The bands are not very clean, so we will try this PCR gain next week.

WHMIS TRAINING and First Sponsorship May 21st 2009
We had our WHMIS training today at the University of Calgary Main Campus. It is a required course to take if we are working in a lab. In the afternoon, I was greeted with some great news: NEB (New England BioLabs) Canada had agreed to sponsor us with lab equipment and reagents. It was our first ever sponsorship. It was also an exciting moment for our entire team as it would save us loads and loads of money because our WetLab team uses a lot of reagents from NEB Canada.
JEREMY
Continuation of Training in the Labs
This afternoon our lab team members ran a gel from yesterday's PCR.  We learned how to prepare agarose gels, load gels and visualize them in the G-Box. The gel that we collectively ran did have a clean negative control; however, we definitely overloaded DNA into the wells of the gel. We learned what to expect when loading gels, and that sometimes you may not even get any bands on the gel. I'm quite excited to break off into our respective mini-projects and start practicing and performing all these lab techniques.
KATIE
Planning PCR Activity
Started to make an outline of what I will be required to do for PCR machine:
Need some way to add items to the machine to make it more interactive then just telling the machine what is required
Looked through the lsl wiki and found llAllowInventoryDrop, which is a function that seems to allow for addition of objects to another as long as it is set to true
If anything can be added then I need to have a way to get rid of everything that is added
I will need some way to incorporate other information besides materials, such as temperatures and times for each cycle
KEVIN
WHMIS traning
The whole morning was spent learning about safety.
Logo
In the afternoon, we brainstormed about our team logo.
MANDY
General Team Affairs
Today, most of the team had WHMIS training on main campus. The afternoon was spent brainstorming potential ideas for an iGEM Calgary team logo (and possibly mascot). Ideas were bounced around in order to prepare some prototypes for a future logo meeting.
PATRICK
Early Development
Retrospective Notebook: This entry was not written on this day, but derived later from working notes I made that day.
First came up with the polymer linking system that I would eventually use without too much modification: each piece of DNA knows the name of the next piece in the polymer. Figuring out what to use as that 'name', and how to store it, would be a much longer process. I noticed very quickly that the internal identifier assigned by SL to each object changed every time the object was copied from the user's inventory, so would not be suitable for tracking polymer structure over time.
Began to notice how important a consistent scheme for inter-object communication would be. Ultimately, the objects that make up the Biobrick simulator would send something like 70 distinct message types, a number which is only set to increase. In the case of the HUD, there would be more than a hundred possible destination objects!
Decided that as a first working goal, I would try to implement the TetR operon, something that as of this writing (August 20 2009) I have not yet fully completed!
PRIMA
Marketing
We had the WHMIS training on main campus all morning (9:00am - 12:00 noon).
In the afternoon, I continued my follow-ups with companies via email. Jeremy, Vicki and I wrote up Thank You letters to the Dragons from Dragon's Den for taking the time out of their busy schedules to watch our marketing pitches, provide feedback, advising us on marketing and business initiatives and way to sell our project.
I researched a few more companies that I had found, wrote up emails and updated the Gmail marketing document.
