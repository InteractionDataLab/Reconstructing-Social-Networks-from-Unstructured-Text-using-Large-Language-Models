TUTORIALS
In this section we provide you with three tutorials. In the first tutorial, we introduce our Membrane Computing (MC) approach and demonstrate how to use our tool. Second tutorial presents the biological aspect of our model using animated visualizations produced by our platform.
Abstract representation of interactions between different chemicals inside a single cell. Note that we have defined the cell as a compartment. Below is rather a cartoonish simulation for random walk of different chemicals inside a cell produced with our model.
