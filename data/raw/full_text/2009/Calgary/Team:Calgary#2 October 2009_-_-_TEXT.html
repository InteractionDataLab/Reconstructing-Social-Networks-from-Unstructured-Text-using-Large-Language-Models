Weekly Team Meeting
The BHsc symposium was discussed .  During the poster presentation they were only a few people attending to the posters .  Next Time: Most of the load for presenting the poster should not be placed on a few people . Organization is key to ensure that there are always enough people at the poster so that others can take a break... Not everyone should stand around the poster . Some people should have the job of bringing other people towards our poster and giving out handout along the way.
Plans for next meeting : Work on the wiki both for Modelling and Notebook

BHSC Symposium and Restreaks for Mutant/Reporter Testing
Today we had our weekly team meeting.  We discussed the BHSC Research symposium and how we can improve on our performance and organization there.  We also talked about T-Shirts, finalizing our design and color choice.  We planned some more fundraising initiatives (read: bake sales!),
After the meeting we did restreaks of all of our plates that we're using for the Mutant/ Reporter testing and I made overnight cultres of B0034-LuxOD47E, B0034-K082003 and R0040-I13502.

Important Meetings
Modelling team had its most important meeting this week. Here is the summary of what we need to work on during the time left:
1. Describe the qualitative model and what it gets at (i.e.,When you change concentrations of LuxPQ, how does expression of Luciferase change? Explain the science behind it.)
2. Explain all the elements of the model. Explain MC approach., formalisms, compartmentalization. Gillespie, why we used Mathematica (and why not Mathlab, etc.), etc.
3. Tutorial of how to use the tool (i.e., what steps do you need to take to find something out). Iman, you were going to make narrated video.
In addition, we need to edit the paper we are working on by the competition time.

Mutant Testing and Discussion
Today we discussed the BHSc research symposium and how we must conserve our team unity throughout the school year even though it may be difficult because we are all in separate courses. In any event, we reflected on how this opportunity acted as one more preparatory step for iGEM.
Mutant testing (See Sept 30) was also performed today, and as not all the cultures grew overnight (including the positive and negative controls) we can't report any conclusive data.
