PROJECT HANDOUTS
The iGEM team made handouts for each sector of the project: Wetlab, Modelling, Second Life and Human Practices. The purpose of handouts were to inform our audience of what the goals are of each sector and how it relates to the overall goal of the iGEM project for the University of Calgary. It also highlights the successes and accomplishments in each of these fields. The handouts were distributed during the aGEM competition as well as other outreach activities the team engaged in. It contains pictures, descriptions, figures and graphs to educate the public of Synthetic biology. The handouts can be viewed below (you can click on the links above the handouts for a fullscreen view with zooming capabilities):
