GVP Cluster
TODO Restrict GVP biobrick with XbaI/PstI and purify both vector and GVP fragment
TODO Restict GVP fragment and pMA-gvpL with MvaI/XhoI and purify 310bp. 2200bp, and 3300bp fragments
TODO Ligate the three fragments into the vector and transform E.coli DB3 cells
TODO Find out wath the problem is with RBS??
Is it one of the restriction enzymes (SpeI/PstI) failing work
Something wrong with biobrick in the sense that there is a red colour where none was expected (where did the RFP come from, and why is it activated so strongly)
340px
→ From left to right: 1kB ladder, Sample Steven, SpeI/PstI control with BBa_K190017, Empty Slot, GVP (6x)
→ For GVP two fragments of ~6000bp and ~3000bp are expected, and for BBa_K190017 fragments of ~900bp and ~2000bp are expected.
The sample of Steven-Jelle did not contain any DNA visible on gel!
The GVP lanes showed the expected fragment sizes, with the addition of single cut vector at ~9000bp. The fragments were cut from the gel for purification.
The restriction test to check SpeI/PstI confirmed the normal funtioning of the enzymes. This makes the RBS plasmid from -80 stock less attractive, because the unwanted RFP is not located behind the RBS to be cut out!
To check another posibility, the stored plasmids from June were cut with SpeI/PstI and the stock plasmid was cut with EcoRI/XbaI to check if the RBS is placed infront of RBS.
