Plan
End date: 2009-06-01
Overall objective: The initial design should be made, the requirements refined. Some initial model prototypes should be made to gain experience in modelling.
Tasks per role:
Analyst
Objective: Project requirements, feasibility and detailed project vision should be finished.
Tasks:
Change Control Manager
Role not used (yet).
Configuration Manager
TODO Configuration Management Plan mostly done.
Designer

Implementer
Objective: Have started with preparation labwork.
Tasks:
What equipment is needed, communicate this with the facility manager.
Order BioBrick restiction enzymes / ligases (fast-digest, Fermentas).
Which chemicals / media are needed and can we use them from the MolGen department. Start ordering chemicals/media.
Work out a cloning strategy, to check feasibility.
Try to make a plan with project parts which can be done simultaneously.
Integrator
Modeller
Project Manager
Public Relations Officer
Objective: Get in contact with other teams and media
Tasks:
Get in contact with iGEM teams from Delft and Amsterdam, and organize a meeting at the end of June for trouble solving and getting to know eachother (Getting There)
Get in contact with the different "studie verenigingen" of the teammembers for publication of a short story about iGEM and the team (TODO)
