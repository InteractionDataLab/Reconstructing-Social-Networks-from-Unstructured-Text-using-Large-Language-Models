GVP Cluster
→ DONE Restriction of GVP and pSB1AC3-Lac/pBAD for assembly
→ DONE Gel purification of wanted fragments and nanodrop
→ DONE Clone GVP cluster behind Lac and Arabinose promoter for expression tests in pSB1AC3 plasmid
→ TODO Test promoter strenght compared to BBa_J23101 promoter (Sven)
→ TODO Enter sequences of constructs to Sandbox
Restriction for Assembly
The vector pSB1AC3 containing the LAC and pBAD inducible promoters were cut with PstI and SpeI to create correct ends for insert of GVP biobrick BBa_I750016 , which was cut with XbaI and PstI.
3 to 16μL plasmid in MQ (1.0μg)
13μL MQ (end volume of 20μL)
2μL  Fast digest buffer
1μL  PstI fast digest enzyme
1μL  SpeI/XbaI fast digest enzyme
Restriction was kept at 37C for 30 min. and put on ice until used for gel purification.
Purification
→ From left to right: 1kB ladder, pSB1AC3-LAC ,Empty Slot, pSB1AC3-pBAD-AraC , Empty Slot, GVP
→ The band for the pSB1AC3-LAC vector was expected to be at ~3700bp (red line), but instead it was at ~2500bp.
→ Comparison with the gel of Frans (constructed pSB1AC3-LAC) explained the band at a lower position (also seen on his gel), but not why it is so small. One option is use of pSB3K3 plasmid instead of pSB1AC3 plasmid, this would still give a band of ~3300bp and not ~2500bp!
A "Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit" Standard Protocol from Roche Applied Science.
→ In step ten, 30μL MQ was added to the dry pellet and incubated at room temperature.
