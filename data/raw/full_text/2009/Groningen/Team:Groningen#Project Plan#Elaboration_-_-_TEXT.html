This is the iteration plan for the Elaboration iteration(s). See the UPEDU artifact description for information on what this is and what it contains (including a template).
Milestone
These are the major milestone objectives for the Elaboration phase:
DONE Final project choice! See our brainstorm page for information on the projects we considered.
TODO Vision , based on the proposal for the chosen project.
TODO Project Plan (all sections)
TODO Risk List , risk assessment should be updated (to reflect our increased understanding of the system).
TODO Iteration Plan , should be finished for Elaboration 2.
TODO Iteration Plan , should be finished for (at least) Construction 1.
TODO Use Cases, how do our bacteria interact with their environment. (Is this useful? Can we define other useful views?)
TODO Requirements, what are the functional and non-functional requirements of our bacteria? Think FURPS for example: Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance and Supportability (although we may want to change this to reflect the differences between software and bacteria).
TODO "Architecture" Document , how do we think our bacteria should be built (structure) and function?
TODO Model(s) of to-be-determined systems, including sensitivity analysis to determine the most important parameters to double-check.
DONE Lab plan / cloning strategy (More or less equivalent to Implementation Model.)
DONE Change Request, determine whether to use them, and if we will, how. (We won't use them. -- Jaspervdg 11:41, 23 June 2009 (UTC))
TODO More?
Resources
Groups working in the lab:
Gvp cluster (1 person)
Metal transporter (2 persons)
Metal accumulation and promoter (if the systems are coupled) (2 persons)
Vectors and promoters (1 person)
In groups with 2 persons there should be one experienced person and one less experienced person.
Note that we're opting to do this for the entire phase instead of each iteration as in UPEDU as this seems more natural (our needs change little over the course of one phase). -- Jaspervdg 11:01, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
[Resources needed for the phase — material, human, financial, and so on.]
Elaboration 1
Plan
End date: 2009-06-01
Overall objective: The initial design should be made, the requirements refined. Some initial model prototypes should be made to gain experience in modelling.
Tasks per role:
Analyst
Objective: Project requirements, feasibility and detailed project vision should be finished.
Tasks:
Change Control Manager
Role not used (yet).
Configuration Manager
TODO Configuration Management Plan mostly done.
Designer
Tasks:
Which bacterial strains, vectors and genes are needed.
Are there multiple BioBricks which can be used in case that one does not work.
Facility Manager
Configuration Management Plan , at least the section "Tools, Environment, and Infrastructure" and "Configuration Identification" where applicable (and anything else needed to establish some basic procedures/conventions for our lab work) In short: Fix a lab, Fix equipment, Fix consumables.
Implementer
Objective: Have started with preparation labwork.
Tasks:
What equipment is needed, communicate this with the facility manager.
Order BioBrick restiction enzymes / ligases (fast-digest, Fermentas).
Which chemicals / media are needed and can we use them from the MolGen department. Start ordering chemicals/media.
Work out a cloning strategy, to check feasibility.
Try to make a plan with project parts which can be done simultaneously.
Integrator
Modeller
Project Manager
Public Relations Officer
Objective: Get in contact with other teams and media
Tasks:
Get in contact with iGEM teams from Delft and Amsterdam, and organize a meeting at the end of June for trouble solving and getting to know eachother (Getting There)
Get in contact with the different "studie verenigingen" of the teammembers for publication of a short story about iGEM and the team (TODO)

Evaluation Criteria
[Functionality, performance, capacity, quality measures, quality goals, and so forth.]
Elaboration 2
Plan
End date: 2009-06-30
Overall objective: The initial design should be made, the requirements refined. Some initial model prototypes should be made to gain experience in modelling.
Tasks per role:
Analyst
Change Control Manager
Role not used (yet).
Configuration Manager
Designer
Facility Manager
Implementer
First parts of the project labwork should be finished successfully.
Which bacterial strains, vectors and genes are needed.
What equipment is needed, communicate this with the facility manager.
Are there multiple BioBricks which can be used in case that one does not work?
Order / ask for genes needed for the project.
Order BioBrick restiction enzymes / ligases (fast-digest, Fermentas).
Which chemicals / media are needed and can we use them from the MolGen department. Start ordering chemicals/media.
Work out a cloning strategy.
Get (everything) in the lab ready for the labwork
Try to make a plan with project parts which can be done simultaneously.

Establish which day the meeting with team TUDelft and Amsterdam can be held
The idea is to have two meetings, one at the beginning of summer and one near the end (possibly in September)
The meetings will take place at the University of one of the teams participating and will possibly move to the city center to end with something to eat at a restaurant
The first meeting is meant to get to know one another, the projects with background information and helping with encountered problems (help in getting DNA, solutions to obstacles, etc.)
The second meeting is more oriented with respect to preparing for the Jamboree, in getting to practice presentations and receive feedback
And last, but not least, to have a great day and get to see the other University from a different angle
Establish contact with Newcastle University for possible collaboration on related project
Keep scanning the iGEM wikis for related projects
Check for correct lab insurance
Make a detailed plan of action on media to contect
