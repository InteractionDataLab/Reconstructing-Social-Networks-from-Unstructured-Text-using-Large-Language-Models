Protocols
Wet
GVP Cluster
→ DONE Isolate plasmids from E.coli Top10 BBa_J23101 cells
→ DONE Plate E.coli Top10 BBa_J23101 cells from o.n. culture
→ TODO Pellet remaining cells for short storage in -20 box (not needed)
→ DONE Place the four test cultures with and without GVP on table at room temperature (make foto)
→ DONE Look at plates stored at 37C with BBa_J61002-pArsR+/pZntR+/pCueO+ and use colonies to grow o.n. cultures for plasmid isolation
Plates
Showed single colony growth on plates with J61002-pMEtal+RBS-RFP plasmids, and were stored in the fridge for future preculture growth.
→ The plates with high and low concentration of transformed cells showed colonies in the expected ratio.
→ On the plates for pZntR+ and pCueO+ no colonies were dark red, indication of ligation of the original high constitutive promoter back into the J61002 vector, or uncut plasmid which was transformed.
→ The plates with pArsR+ plasmid showed only a few non-coloured colonies, mostly medium red colour, andn a few dark red colonies. It was already thought that the pArsR is a bit leaky and causes expression of RFP.
Over Night Cultures
→ Both cultures of BBa_J61002-J23101 showed growth, and can be used for plasmid isolation.

Plasmid Purification
Plasmid isolation was performed on the cultures of E.coli TOP10 containing plasmids BBa_J61002 with BBa_J23101 constitutive promoter with the "Sygma-Aldrich™ GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit".
From each tube 4mL of culture was collected in one 2.0mL cup, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min. at max. speed and the supernatant discarded.
Plasmids were eluted with 40μL MQ and stored in the fridge
New over night cultures (2 days)
The six plates containing colonies of E.coli TOP10 with BBa_J61002-pArsR+/pZntR+/pCueO+ were used to inoculate four tubes with 5 mL LB-amp100 for each promoter.
→ Instead of an over night incubation, the incubation time was increased to two nights, because it was sunday.
Buoyancy Test
Four tubes with 6mL LB-amp100 were inoculated with E.coli TOP10 pNL29, pSB1AC3-M/L-GVP, and pSB1AC3-RFP yesterday afternoon. All tubes had cell growth of comparable size, but no OD600 measurement was made.
→ The tubes were placed in a foam support to let the cells come to rest and placed at room temperature (a picture was taken as time zero, see below).
Transporters
Metal Accumulation
Transform E. coli with pSB1AC3-fMT, MymT, SmtA ligations
Use chemically competent cells and transform using heat shock (37°C)
Transform ligation mixtures of
pSB1AC3 + MymT
pSB1AC3 + SmtA
pSB1AC3 + fMT
pSB1AC3 (self ligation control)
pSB1AC3-H + RFP (31-07-09; positive control)
MQ (negative control)
Plate on LBAmp and put o/n in 37°C
