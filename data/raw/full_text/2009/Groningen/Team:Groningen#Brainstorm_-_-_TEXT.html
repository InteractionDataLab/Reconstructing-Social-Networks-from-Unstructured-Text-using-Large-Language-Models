List of Demands and wishes
In order to be able to make a choice from the, in the beginning, almost endless list of possible project we made a list of demands and wishes. This list allows to choose a project which is not only fun but also realistic and doable in the time we had untill the jamboree. It works as a guide and is used often in design processes.
Demands
Labwork is feasible in 3 month with 8 students.
Modelling feasible in 3 months with 3 students.
Everyone has to agree with the idea
Financially feasible with a budget of 31.170,00 euro of which 8000 euros used for labwork.
A new concept, not yet done before in this way, either the iGEM or in the synthetic biology
Meets the criteria of iGEM
Materials have to be attainable, either via the RuG or able to order in.
Parameters for modelling have to be known, or available or attainable.
Knowledge about the genes that we are using has to be available.
Wishes
Not too complicated, not too many genes or gene clusters
Has to have an application
Using BioBricks that are easy to obtain, preferable available at the RuG.
Preferably knowledge on the host, genes and/or end products has to be available at the RuG
Some students in the team have experience working with the host.
It is possible to find sponsoring for this project.
