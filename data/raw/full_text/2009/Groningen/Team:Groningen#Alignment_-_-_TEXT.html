From 2009.igem.org
The theoretical  modeling data is used from papers is based on plasmids R46 and R773. To see the different between the chromosomal and the plasmids genes, they are aligned with clustalW . The functional binding site from arsenic is on residues Cys32, Cys34, and the nonessential Cys37 ( Rensing2005 ). Plasmids R46, R773, strain K12 and DH10B are aligned, and all have the same functional binding site on the same position. The distance between the genes is not significant. The assumption is that there is no difference in binding of arsenic and function between chromosomal and plasmids genes.
