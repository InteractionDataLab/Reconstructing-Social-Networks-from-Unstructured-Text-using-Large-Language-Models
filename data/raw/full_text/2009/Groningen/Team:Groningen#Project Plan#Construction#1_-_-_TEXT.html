This is the iteration plan for the Construction iteration(s). See the UPEDU artifact description for information on what this is and what it contains (including a template).
Milestone
These are the major milestone objectives for the Construction phase:
TODO Our wonderful buoyant, metal filtering bacteria should be alive and kicking!
TODO (?) The lab/plan cloning strategy should be fully worked out at the end of the phase to reflect our final decisions on which parts/protocols/procedures/? to use. (I think this roughly corresponds to the Implementation Model in UPEDU. -- Jaspervdg 11:09, 23 June 2009 (UTC))
TODO The Iteration plan for the transition phase completed and reviewed.
TODO (?) Design Model (and all constituent artifacts) updated with new design elements identified during the completion of all requirements. (I think this can roughly be seen as fleshing out all the device designs and parts, or in other words: making sure The Project is up-to-date. -- Jaspervdg 11:09, 23 June 2009 (UTC))
TODO More?
Resources
Note that we're opting to do this for the entire phase instead of each iteration as in UPEDU as this seems more natural (our needs change little over the course of one phase). -- Jaspervdg 11:01, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
[Resources needed for the phase — material, human, financial, and so on.]
Construction 1
Overall objective:
The basic model should be ready
The seperate part of the labwork should be known and working or almost working
modellers should know which parameters they need so the labworkers can prepare providing these
The tickets and hostel should be booked
Week 27
June 30 - July 5 :

Have genes as BioBricks in the vector, together with all DNA elements needed for expression (RBS, term etc).
Work on the final parts should have been started.
Try to find protocols for the characterization, to check feasibility.
Keep record of the labwork on the Notebook site
GVP (Michael and Paul)
Test insert length of gvp cluster (E-genR-X-RBS-PART-S-P in vector , Figure 1)
(Needed?) Silence restrictionsites in gvp cluster by PCR (BamHI, XhoI, BglII --> used in other BBa standard assemblies)and remove repeat in gvpL.
Add the terminator to the construct
If needed add promoter (constitutive promoter --> ) to do initial phenotype testing.
Metal transporters (Jolanda, SJ)
Transform E. coli with construct (HmtA first, get GlpF either by ordering or by genome PCR. Then order primers + pre/suffix and RBS in prefix).
Test insert length.
Silence restrictionsites in HtmA by PCR (2x PstI) and add BioBrick pre/suffix.
Clone the terminator in to the construct.
Metal accumulation (Wilfred, Nienke)
Decide which Metallothioneins will be used.
Transform E. coli with construct / synthetic gene.
Test insert length.
(If needed) Silence restrictionsites in gvp cluster by PCR.
Add BioBrick pre/suffix by PCR.
Clone the terminator in to the construct.
Vectors (Sven, Frans (Modelling aswell?)):
Transform E. coli TOP10 with pSB3K3 and E. coli DB3.1 with pSB1AC3.
pSB3K3 contains a p15A ORI and Kan resistance.
pSB1AC3 contains Amp + Cam resistance markers, a ccdB death gene and a pMB1 ORI.
Add different promoters to the vectors:
Inducible are: pBAD-AraC  in pSB2K3 and the Lac promoter  in pSB1A2.
Constitutive are: High expected expression yield,  and Low expected expression yield, Lac promoter with mutated operator . For these promoter sequences are too small, oligo's have to be ordered + BBa pre/suffix !!without RBS!!
Metal sentitive are possibly copA  (order oligo's) and ??
Clone in such a way that they are nicely -10 / -30 in front of the start codon.
Test functionality of the promoters by cloning GFP + RBS + Terminator behind the promoter (BioBrick??).
Integrator
Modeller
Project Manager
Have both modellers and labworkers up and running.
Labworkers have choosen the parts and tested those. The bouyancy, metal intake and accumulation should be tested and working seperatly.
Have a start-up model and make sure the labworkers know which parameters the modellers need and can or already have provided these.
Have choosen a tester, a "testplan" should have been made, the necessary equipment should be at least ordered.
the tickets and hostel should be booked, so plans for jamboree or thereafter should be known roughly.
Public Relations Officer
Get in contact with papers, magazines and other media for possible publications.

DONE Make a detailed list of things that should be measured in relation to buoyancy, indicating how well a guess we already have. For example (pretty much everything we'd love to have as a time series):
Densities (of cells).
Volume fraction of gas vesicles (needs to be determined how best to estimate this), to check the relationship between the density of the rest of the cell and the presence of gas vesicles.
(Relative) promotor strengths? (We should be able to relate this to gvp/transporter expression in some way!)
DONE Reality check for buoyancy with arsenic.
Model accumulation of arsenic in E. coli.
DONE How well does ArsR(+fusion protein) bind to its binding site.
TODO How well does ArsR(+fusion protein) bind to arsenic.
DONE Reaction rate(s) for binding, unbinding, production and degradation of ArsR(+fusion protein)?

GVP (1pers):
Place three different constituive promotors with low, medium, and high activity in front of GVP-cluster
→ DONE cutting the vector with promotor sequence resulted in a fragment of about 50bp and was difficult to locate on 1% agarose gel
→ DONE gel purification of cut vector with GVP resulted in such a low concentration (4.3 ng/μL), it was not usable in the next step (ligation)
→ DONE next option is cutting out GVP-cluster, and ligate it into the promotor vector (other way around).
The cutting and ligation was one of the more serious issues of Melbourne 2007 team, and might give us the same problems to keep in mind
→ DONE check if transformation/ligation has worked (failed)
Isolate new plasmids of GVP and the three promotors to continu work
→ DONE grow new cultures of each from the glycerol stocks

→ DONE storage in -20°C is kept up to data by the persons working in the lab, and excel sheats are made for on the door
Cloning strategy (make a plan up to the final assembly)
→ TODO what are the target vectors going to be, and which genes are going to be grouped together
