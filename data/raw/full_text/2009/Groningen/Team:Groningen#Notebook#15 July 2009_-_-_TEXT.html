GVP Cluster
Restriction for Assembly
The vector ( BBa_J61035 ) containing GVP cluster was cut with PstI and XbaI to create correct ends for insert in promotor vector ( BBa_J61002 ).
10μL  MQ
6μL plasmid in MQ (2μg) (329.7 ng/μL)
2μL  Fast digest buffer
1μL  PstI fast digest enzyme
1μL  XbaI fast digest enzyme
The vector ( BBa_J61002 ) containing promotor BBa_J23100 was cut with SpeI and PstI.
4μL  MQ
12μL plasmid in MQ (155.4 ng/μL)
2μL  Fast digest buffer
1μL  SpeI fast digest enzyme
1μL  PstI fast digest enzyme
The cups were incubated in a heat block at 37°C for 30 min. followed by adding 4μL 6x loading buffer for gel electroforesis.
Gel electroforesis
24μL of each sample was loaded on a 1% agarose gel (devided over two slots) with EtBr and a 1kb ladder was used (see picture).
→ From left to right: Empty slot, 1kb Marker, Empty slot, HmtA PCR reaction, Empty slot, (2x) GVP, Empty slot, (2x) BBa_J23100 , and Empty slot
Gel Purification of GVP
"High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit" from Roche was used for gel purification.
~200mg of gel containing the desired fragment was dissolved in 500μL binding buffer by heating to 60°C for 10 min. and carefully vortexing.
250μL isopropanol was added to the tube and vortexed
dissolved gel was transfered to the column and centrifuged for 1 min.
column was washed with 500μL Wash Solution, centrifuged for 1 min., 200μL Wash solution was added and centrifuged for 1 min.
15μL MQ was applied to the column, incubated for 3 min. at room temperature and centrifuged for 1 min. at full speed.
Concentration of GVP-vector
The concentration of isolated cut vector of GVP with EcoRI and XbaI was determined with the use of a nano-drop.
GVP-cluster eluted in MQ
33.5 ng/μL
1.65 (260/280)
0.77 (260/230)
BBa_J23100 + vector eluted in MQ
14.2 ng/μL
1.78 (260/280)
1.01 (260/230)
→ Concentrations are just high enough for a ligation reaction to be performed, some additional tuning of the procedure is required!!
Ligation of GVP into BBa_J23100 vector
Mix:
1 μL T4 Ligase buffer
1 μL Vector (J23100 restriction fragment, 14.2 ng/μL)
7.6 μL Insert (GVP gene cluster, 33.5 ng/μL)
0.5 μL T4 Ligase
Method:
The mixture is incubated 30 min, 26°C
To inactivate Ligase 10 min 70°C
Transformation of E.coli TOP10 cells with GVP + J23100
2 μL Ligation mix added to cells from -80°C glycerol stock
30 min incubation on ice
5 min heat shock 37°C
5 min on ice
Cells added to 3 ml Ty in a reaction tube
Incubation 1 h in waterbath shaker 37°C
The cells are plated on Ty agar (100 μg/ml)
On one plate 200 μL is streaked out. The rest is concentrated (centrifugation: 1 min, 14600rpm) in 200 μL and also plated.
Incubation o/n 37°C
