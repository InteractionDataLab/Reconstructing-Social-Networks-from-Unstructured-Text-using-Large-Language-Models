Weekend stuff
Culture check
Restriction analysis has raised suspicion on the vector that contains the inducible promotors pLac and pBAD. Cultures were grown to check this.  Although not stated on the culture it is expected to be a LB culture supplemented with Chloramphenicol to discriminate between  and .
AC3? fMT pLAc shows no growth
AC3? pBAD shows no growth
AC3 fMT shows slight growth
AC3? pLAC shows no growth
Also a seemingly unrelated culture was picked out of the incubator
AC3 H1, fully grown and dying for quite a while. Probably old culture
* NOTE: to my fellow lab people, please state medium+antibiotics and date of inoculation.
All floating stuff
The saline solutions don't show any differences between the different samples, only pNL29 seems slightly higher which is more noticeable in the sampled that were spinned down.
(Taken using light coming mainly from above and behind the test tubes (a large fluorescent tube light). Lights in front of the test tubes were switched off and a black folder held on the window side (on the right) to avoid reflections. The background was dark grey.)
The large column was covered with parafilm to prevent air particles to enter and to improve lab hygiene.  Density of culture in the column appears to be higher closer to the bottom, but culture is still separated over the entire height of the column.
Metal accumulation
Pure cultures inoculated 28august2009 on LB+Amp120 of:
pSB1AC3 fMT #6
pSB1AC3 pLac
pSB1AC3 pBAD
pSB1AC3 SmtA #3
pSB1AC3 pLow-fMT #3
pSB1AC3 pLow-fMT #4
pSB1AC3 pLac-fMT #2
All yielded single colonies, which were put to ON cultures for glycerol stocks
Due to the uncertainty of the vectors of inducible promotor mentioned cultures will be grown in Chloramphenicol supplemented LB in addition to a culture in LB+Amp120, this to reduce the necessity of restriction analysis. If it is in pSB1A2, it should not grow on Chloramphenicol.
Transformation
ON ligation of SmtA with pLac or pLow were transformed into TOP10 E. coli, 5 μL in 50 μL aliquots. Cells were incubated on ice for ~30 min. and heat shock was applied 42 °C, 45 sec. Cells were left to recover on ice prior to adding 200 μL LB followed by 1 h of recovery @ 37 °C. Transformations were plated out on LB+Amp100 plates (50 μL & 200 μL) and incubated @ 37 °C ON.
