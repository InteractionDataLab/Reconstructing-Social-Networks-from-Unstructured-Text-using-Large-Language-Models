GVP Cluster
O.n. precultures
→ All tubes for plasmid isolation (pLacI (pSB1A2)(no.1 and no.2), pSB2K3 (12J)(2x) and pSB2K3 (12L)(2x) showed growth. The pSB2K3 had less growth (and smaller pellet) than the other tubes.

Plasmid isolation
Plasmid isolation was performed on the cultures of E.coli TOP10 containing the above mentioned plasmids with the "Sygma-Aldrich™ GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit".
From each tube 4mL of culture was collected in a 2.0mL cup (tubes from pSB2K3 12J and 12L were combined), and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min. at max. speed and the supernatant discarded.
Plasmids were eluted with 30μL MQ and stored in the fridge

Metal Accumulation
Alignment fMT
Alignments of the metallothionein fMT constructs, above is In silico construct, below is sequence determined with VF2 primer. The first is without promotor (), second with constitutive promotor  () and the third with IPTG inducible promotor  (). RBS is . In combining the promotor and the coding sequence the Partregistry seems to add two unexpected additional bases (ag) between the two, missing in sequenced sample. In preparing the In silico construct a different prefix (lacking two bases (ag)), seen in sequenced samples, was used. The n's in the suffix of  were determined to be a g as expected when giving a closer look into the chromatogram.
Alignment MBP-ArsR
Alignments of the metal chelator Maltose Binding Protein (MBP)-ArsR fusion protein (). Above is In silico construct, in the middle is sequence determined with VF2 primer, below the sequence determined with VR primer. A Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site is added between the two proteins.
