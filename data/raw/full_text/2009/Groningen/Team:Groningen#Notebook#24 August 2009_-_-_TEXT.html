Plasmid Purification
Plasmid isolation was performed on the cultures of E.coli TOP10 containing plasmids BBa_J61002 with Zinc+RBS , Copper+RBS and Arsenic+RBS promoters and RFP with the "Sygma-Aldrich™ GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit".
From each tube 4mL of culture was collected in a 2.0mL cup, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min. at max. speed and the supernatant discarded.
Plasmids were eluted with 30μL MQ and stored in the fridge
Restriction Control
Isolated plasmids were cut with fast-digest enzymes EcoRI and PstI to cut out promoter-RFP, and create ~2000bp and ~950bp fragments.
→ From left to right: 1kB ladder, pArsR (4x), pCueO (3x), pZntR (3x)
→ The concentration of plasmids was not determined before restriction was done, and likely the concentration was to high to give a band at ~3000bp of uncut plasmid.
→ From left to right: 1kB ladder, pArsR (2x), pCueO (2x), pZntR (2x), Control BBa_J23101, Empty Slot
→ The 2% Agarose gel was run for 15 min. at 100V to get separation at low bp fragments, larger parts are grouped together at the top
→ The expected sizes are seen in the gel, plasmids can be send for sequencing!
Transporters
Metal Accumulation
Check pSB1AC3-mymT, fmt, smtA
Pick 3 colonies of E. coli TOP10 + pSB1AC3-mymT, fmt, smtA.
Add 1uL MQ and microwave 1min to lyse the cells.
Do colony PCR with VR/VF primers and RBS-fw/gene specific rev primers.
Run PCR products on gel.
From left to right:
Upper: SmtA-1 till 3 (1200bp), fMT 4-6 (500bp), MymT 7-8(500), AC3 (315bp) (using VF2/VR primers)
Lower: SmtA-1 till 3 (900bp), fMT 4-6 (200bp), MymT 7-9(215bp) (using gene specific primers)
Thereby the construct of Mymt-pSB1AC3 nr7-9 do not give correct fragment size, also the constructs pSB1AC3-SmtA nr 1 and pSB1AC3-fMT nr 5 do not give correct fragment size.
Put o/n culture @ warm room of pSB1AC3-SmtA nr2&3 and pSB1AC3-fMT nr 4&6.
Cloning of MymT into pSB1AC3 or other vectors has stopped
It is considered to be to much time consuming to also clone MymT next to the other MTs.
Vectors
Metal promotors
origin of replication determines:
Vector copy number
Plasmid compatibility: its ability to replicate in conjuction with another plasmid.
Plasmids that utilize the same replication system cannot co-exist in the same bacterial cell.
pMB1* and ColE1 are in different compatibility group
pMB1 and ColE1 are too similar and thus not compatible
* pMB1 is the pUC19 derived ori present in pSB1AC3
