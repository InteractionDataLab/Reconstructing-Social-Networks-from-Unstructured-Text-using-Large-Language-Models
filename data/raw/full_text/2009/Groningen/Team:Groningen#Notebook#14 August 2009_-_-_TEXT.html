Protocols
Wet
GVP Cluster
→ DONE make glycerol stocks for pSB1AC3-BBa_J23106-BBa_I750016 and pSB1AC3-BBa_J23109-BBa_I750016 (two o.n. cultures of each are grown)
→ DONE isolate plasmid J61002-BBa_J23100, J61002-BBa_J23106, and J61002-BBa_J23109 from o.n. cultures
→ DONE make a planning for next week
Plates
Showed single colony growth on plates with pSB3K3-H/L-GVP plasmids, and were stored in the fridge for future preculture growth.
→ The plates with pSB1AC3-H-GVP plasmid showed no growth, and were stored at 37°C for an additional 4 hours to be sure. Still no growth after addition incubation at 37°C, can be due to high energy cost of vesicle production resulting in the death of the cells!
Over Night Cultures
→ All cultures showed growth, and can be used for plasmid isolation and glycerol stocks. From each culture 800uL was added to 300uL 87% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Stocks were stored at position 21 to 24 in the -80°C fridge.

Plasmid Purification
Plasmid isolation was performed on the cultures of E.coli TOP10 containing plasmids BBa_J61002 with high , medium and low constitutive promoters with the "Sygma-Aldrich™ GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit".
From each tube 8mL of culture was collected in a 2.0mL cup, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min. at max. speed and the supernatant discarded.
Plasmids were eluted with 50μL MQ and stored in the fridge

Transporters
PCR2, PCR1 Dynazyme XbaI
HmtA
After 2 weeks of PCR-ing plasmid isolations there is a product worth wile to send for sequencing. 4,5,6, and 8
In the first 4 lanes  PCR2 (261bp) is created from HmtA-AC3 plasmid with PstI 's left in place. In lane 5 till 8 PCR1 (1153bp)is made from HmtA-AC3 plasmid with PstI 's left in place to make mega primers to mutate the restriction sites.
In the lower left quarter is a PCR on HmtA-AC3 plasmid with PstI 's left in place with VF2 VR and failed.   The second lower quarter is a XbaI restriction control on plasmids 4,5,6 and 8 not completely digested but indicating the construct is correct in the way that there is a restriction site of the bio brick, meaning the EcoRI mutation got removed.
Metal Accumulation
ligate MymT in pSB1AC3
Purify mymT-RBS-pre/suff from gel using Roche Gel Extraction kit
Elute in 25uL TE buffer (pH8)
Digest mymT-RBS-pre/suff with EcoRI and Spe I
Ligate with pSB1AC3/EcoRI-SpeI
Vectors
Dry
Jasper changed the model to take dimeric binding of ArsR into account and to ignore ArsD, as well as putting an image map on-line as the first step towards a clearer interface. The new model leads to a number of third order equations, which means that it is no longer feasible to give closed-form solutions, but it does seem perfectly feasible to compute the solutions numerically (as demonstrated by the updated calculator on the accumulation page ).
