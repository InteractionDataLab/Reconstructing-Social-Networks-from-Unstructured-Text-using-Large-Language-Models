GVP Cluster
Colonies grown for 30 hours
From the transformed E. coli TOP10 cells with BBa_J23109 , BBa_J23100 and BBa_J23106 three single colonies of each were chosen to plate anew on TY-agar-amp. plates. After hitting the colony, the cells were swiped in a single straight line, the tip heated and a new stripe through the old was made. This was repeated three times in total. The plates were stored at 37C over night.
Transporters
Purification of HmtA (PA Q9I147 6xHis Tag)
Growing cells and purification
Resuspend pellet in 50mM KPi pH7,0 with 1M NaCl
Spin down for 25 min at 80 000 rpm (TLA 100.4)
Add 1 ml solubilazation buffer to the pellet
Solubilzation buffer (for 25ml)
1,25 ml KPi (1M)
2 ml NaCl ( 5M)
6,67 ml Glycerol (75%)
15,08 ml water
30 min on ice
Spin down for 25 min at 80 000 rpm (TLA 100.4)
Wash the Ni-NTA beads;
30 ul Ni-NTA in 1 ml buffer A,
Spin 2 min 3500 rpm, remove supernatant
Add supernatant of protein to epi with the Ni-NTA pellet
Incubate for 2 h, shaking
Spin 4 min at 3500 rpm with table spin
Wash
2x with 1ml buffer B+0,1% triton (20mM imidazole)
store the supernatants for use in SDS-gel electrophoresis
2x with 1ml bufferB+01,% Triton (40 mM imidazole)
store the supernatants for use in SDS-gel electrophoresis
Elute
3x with 30uL BufferC+0,1%Triton (500mM imidazole)
store the supernatants for use in SDS-gel electrophoresis
Vectors
Isolated plasmid using 'Sigma Gen Elute plasmid miniprep kit'
-performed additional wash step in both samples.
-eluted in 50ul dH2O

A start was made with modelling arsenic uptake on the Modelling page. It was mentioned by Martijn (iGEM team member of last year) that there exists software to give an estimate of binding affinities, in case we can't find specific ones (he hasn't been able to find the right link yet though).
Also, a planning for Construction 1 was made, focussing on arsenic for now. During the meeting the lab workers agreed that apart from arsenic the next metals to look at would be Zinc and Copper.
