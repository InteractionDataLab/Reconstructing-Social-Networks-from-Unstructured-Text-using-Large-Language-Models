And of course our sponsors, who made this project possible:
Besides being a student city, Groningen is also ahead in the areas of research, innovation and entrepreneurship: a real city of talent. In order to make this known to the rest of the Netherlands, University of Groningen, Hanze University Groningen, the UMCG University Medical Center Groningen and the Province and municipality of Groningen have joined forces. Under the common denominator of ‘Groningen, City of Talent’, in conjunction with Marketing Groningen, they have started a national campaign under the motto of: ‘Here is space for talent. Space for learning, for working and for growing. For further personal development and making the best of yourself. And there is room for living, sports and entertainment. There’s no place like Groningen.’
The Centre for Synthetic Biology (CSB) is a multi-institution effort of the University of Groningen to forge research expertise in the emerging field of synthetic biology. The aim of the initiative is to integrate advanced knowledge within the disciplines of biomolecular sciences, synthetic chemistry, physics and mathematics to (re)design and build integrated biological and (semi-)artificial systems or materials.
