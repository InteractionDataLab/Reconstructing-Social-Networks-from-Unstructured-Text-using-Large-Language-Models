GVP Cluster
All precultures containing a plasmid with a promoter have grown to the expected density! Time for some plasmid isolation to be carried out...
→ DONE weekly meeting (9 to 12)
→ DONE isolate plasmids from precultures
→ DONE perform a restriction on the medium promoter containing plasmids with SpeI and PstI
→ DONE purify cut vectors with miniprep (11bp fragment should be lost)
→ TODO perform a ligation between cut vector and GVP fragment
→ TODO transform E.coli TOP10 competent cells with ligation product
www.sigmaaldrich.com
Plasmid Purification
Plasmid isolation was performed on the cultures of E.coli TOP10 containing plasmids pSB3K3 and pSB1AC3 with high, medium and low constitutive promoters with the "Sygma-Aldrich™ GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit".
From each tube 3mL of culture was collected in a 1.5mL cup, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 min. at max. speed and the supernatant discarded.
Plasmids were eluted with 50μL MQ and stored in the fridge
Concentration
The concentration of isolated plasmid was determined with the use of a nano-drop.
pSB3K3-highP in MQ
11.3 ng/μL
0.227 (260/280)
0.114 (260/230)

pSB1AC3-lowP in MQ
47.9 ng/μL
0.957 (260/280)
0.512 (260/230)
Restriction for Assembly
The vector pSB1AC3 containing the high , medium and low constitutive promoters were cut with PstI and SpeI to create correct ends for insert of GVP biobrick BBa_I750016 .
16μL plasmid in MQ (0.8-1.6μg)
2μL  Fast digest buffer
1μL  PstI fast digest enzyme
1μL  SpeI fast digest enzyme
Vector Purification
Cut vector purification was performed on the restricted plasmid pSB1AC3 containing the high , medium and low constitutive promoters with the "Sygma-Aldrich™ GenElute™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit". The 11bp fragment between the SpeI and PstI restriction sites should be lost in this way, and gel purification may be omitted.
After adding 200μL of resuspention buffer, 200μL lysis buffer and 350μL neutralization buffer the solution was centrifuged for 10min. and the standard protocol was followed.
Cut vectors were eluted with 20μL MQ and stored in the fridge
Concentration
The concentration of purified cut vector was determined with the use of a nano-drop.
pSB1AC3-highP-res. in MQ
14.9 ng/μL
0.278 (260/280)
0.172 (260/230)

19.7 ng/μL
0.394 (260/280)
0.204 (260/230)
pSB1AC3-lowP-res. in MQ
17.5 ng/μL
0.349 (260/280)
0.210 (260/230)
Over Night Cultures
Over night cultures in 4mL LB-amp100 medium were prepared from the remaining overnight cultures of:
→ E.coli TOP10 pSB3K3-high const. promoter (kan.)
→ E.coli TOP10 pSB3K3-med. const. promoter (kan.)
→ E.coli TOP10 pSB3K3-low const. promoter (kan.)
and put in the 37°C waterbath at 200 rpm. This was done because the low copy plasmid resulted in a to low isolated concentration. Longer growth and elution in less MQ should increase the recovered amount.
Over night culture in 5mL LB-amp100 medium was prepared from the following glycerol stock:
→ E.coli TOP10 GVP1 (amp.)
and put in the 37°C waterbath at 200 rpm.
Transporters
GlpF
Restriction, ligation and transformation. Done as noted at 31 July . only the inactivation step was not done using a agarose gel but by using a PCR clean up kit (Sigma-Aldrich).

Jasper did some "maintenance" on the Wiki and created a diagram of the processes involved in arsenic filtering.
Kb made the final changes to the brochure. This is the final version
The ‘dojo’ graph doesn’t work in Mozzila firefoxs. This problem is fixed trough set both the id and name attributes of the iframe. http://www.dyn-web.com/tutorials/iframes/
