Protocols
Originally the Rainbow bacteria , we now no longer plan to use the Cre/Lox system, but rather focus on glucose sensing. This choice was made because we have no good way to control the cre/lox recombination the way we would need for glucose sensing.
The idea now is to create a bacterium that senses the outside glucose concentration and produces an inversely proportional response.
Requirements
We use the MoSCoW prioritization method :
Must have this:
Response should be inversely proportional to the outside glucose concentration.
It should be measurable on-line (visually for example).
Should have this if at all possible:
Response should be a gradient (not just on/off).
Delay in the response should not exceed roughly 5-10 minutes.
(Model) parameters should be known or obtainable.
Could have this if it does not affect anything else:
Response should reasonably accurately follow the concentration (after a delay).
Won't have this now but would like in the future:
Expand to other metabolisms.
Produce something more useful than a colour.
Design
Our bacterium would have the following components:
The PTS system , which is already present in ... Which organisms?
A promoter that hooks into the PTS system. Can be either:
Constitutively active, but repressed by CcpA.
Activated by CcpA.
Product behind promoter as response.
Degradation-tag attached to the product to increase turnover rate.
Modelling
First of all we are trying to model the PTS system as is. We're looking at the following existing models:
A limited model consisting of only 9 substances and 7 reactions, as described in Neves1999 .
A more complete model by M.H.N. Hoefnagel, J. Hugenholtz and J.L. Snoep (hoefnagel2), discussed in Hoefnagel2002 .
Our attempts at using these models are available in our SVN repository .
Once we have a model of the PTS system we will try adding one or more "reactions" for the HPr phosphorylation/dephosphorylation under the influence of FBP and ATP, as this leads to HPr-ser46, which lets Ccpa bind to a cre site more easily. For the moment it is assumed that HPr and Ccpa are available in abundance.
