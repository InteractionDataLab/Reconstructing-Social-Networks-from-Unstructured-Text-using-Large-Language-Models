(Redirected from Team:Groningen/Roles )
This is still largely in need of more detail.
For an overview of role assignments, see our team page .
Most of these roles are related to the core activity of our team, advancing our project. These are mostly based on the UPEDU roles . However, we also felt the need for some roles that are not directly related to the project, but are useful to keep our team running smoothly. As UPEDU does not concern itself with this aspect of a project these are all necessarily non-UPEDU roles:
Scribe
Treasurer
Public Relations Officer
Facility Manager
