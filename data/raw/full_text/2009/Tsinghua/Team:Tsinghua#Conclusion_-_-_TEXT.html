Degree of Completeness Regarding the Entire Project
Project Completeness Judging Form
In conclusion, we have sucessfully achieved what we have previously planned to do. In order for the readers to better comprehend the achievement of our project, we summarized them on a judging form. Three designed modules have been independently constructed and characterized. Some experiments also suggests the recombination of the modules can also work. The module-based design of our project faciliated our experiment, and the ongoing step is the recombination of all of the three modules to synthesize a syngenome based GenSniper. We have partially completed the last step and the outcome will be promising regarding the development of gene therapy approaches based on BioBricks, especially the well-defined Targeted BioBricks.
Project completeness summary
Future Work
1.Produce the GenSniper with both Therapeutic DNA and Targeted BioBrick modification and generate the electronic microscopy pictures of the purified viroins.
2.Further characterize the requirements for Therapeutic DNA package into the GenSniper viroin (whether a stuffer is needed) and incorporate eukaryotic expression BioBricks for functional identification
3.Construct more Targeted BioBricks with different peptide modification and test their specificity to different cells via the established GFP fusion method.
4.Further modify and standardize the Targeted BioBrick-GFP production system for large-scale Targeted BioBricks identification.
Insight to Further Research and Human Practice
Though we have showed the characterization of our three modules and some of their recombination, a targeted gne therapy vector based on Targeted Biobrick still need a large number of experiment for contruct and characterize before experimental gene delivery and clinical use.
We do hope our project can throw insight on researchers in the area of gene therapy on:
1) Using Targeted BioBricks for cell-specific gene delivery;
2) Using synthetic genome approach to construct gene therapy vector with a prokaryotic production system for mass production;
3) Taking BioBrick-similar standards into consideration for constructing standardized targeted gene therapy vectors with interchangeable on their specificity
4) Engineering a natural mechanism of large segment therapeutic genes package into the synthetic gene therapy vector.
