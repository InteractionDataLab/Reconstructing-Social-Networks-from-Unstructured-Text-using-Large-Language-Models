The Tsinghua iGEM09 team is composed of 10 to 20 elite undergraduate students from several different departments, supported by a well-known Tsinghua society called Tsinghua Student Association of Synthetic Biology. Our society has regular affairs, such as journalc clubs and brainstorms, for transmitting the ideas of synthetic biology.

What We Did
This year Tsinghua iGEM team works on a human practice based approach to contructing a targeted gene therapy vector. In order to synthesize a targeted gene therapy vector with as more advantages as possible, we conducted several brainstorming meetings and finalized our whole project design via synthetic genome approach.
Furthermore, we hope our designed targeted gene therapy vector accords with the standards of BioBricks, so that it can be further explored by future research. Thus, we designed, constructed and characterized a BioBrick composed of cell-specific peptide, adenovirus fiber shaft and RGD domain, which we termed Targeted BioBrick .

About Tsinghua
Tsinghua University was established in 1911, originally under the name “Tsinghua Xuetang”. The school was renamed "Tsinghua School" in 1912. The university section was founded in 1925. The name “National Tsinghua University” was adopted in 1928.
The faculty greatly valued the interaction between Chinese and Western cultures, the sciences and humanities, the ancient and modern. Tsinghua scholars Wang Guowei, Liang Qichao, Chen Yinque and Zhao Yuanren, renowned as the "Four Tutors" in the Institute of Chinese Classics, advocated this belief and had a profound impact on Tsinghua's later development.
Tsinghua University was forced to move to Kunming and join with Peking University and Nankai University to form the Southwest Associated University due to the Resistance War against the Japanese Invasion in 1937. In 1946 The University was moved back to its original location in Beijing after the war.
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the University was molded into a polytechnic institute focusing on engineering in the nationwide restructuring of universities and colleges undertaken in 1952. In November 1952, Mr. Jiang Nanxiang became the President of the University. He made significant contributions in leading Tsinghua to become the national center for training engineers and scientists with both professional proficiency and personal integrity.
Since China opened up to the world in 1978, Tsinghua University has developed at a breathtaking pace into a comprehensive research university. At present, the university has 14 schools and 56 departments with faculties in science, engineering, humanities, law, medicine, history, philosophy, economics, management, education and art. The University has now over 25,900 students, including 13,100 undergraduates and 12,800 graduate students. As one of China’s most renowned universities, Tsinghua has become an important institution for fostering talent and scientific research.
The educational philosophy of Tsinghua is to "train students with integrity." Among over 120,000 students who have graduated from Tsinghua since its founding are many outstanding scholars, eminent entrepreneurs and great statesmen remembered and respected by their fellow Chinese citizens.
With the motto of “Self-Discipline and Social Commitment” and the spirit of “Actions Speak Louder than Words”, Tsinghua University is dedicated to the well-being of Chinese society and to world development.
Inter-Team Activity
Mary Yang, who is also a member of the Stanford iGEM09 team, went to Stanford University for an internship with Stanford iGEM09 working on modeling. Their project is about immuno-balance.
