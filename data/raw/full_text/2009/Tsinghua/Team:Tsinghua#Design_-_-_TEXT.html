Three modules in our project
Based on our basic idea and decoupling principle of synthetic biology, we subdivided our project into three interconnected modules: 1) Synthesis of the GenSniper virion which involves the synthesis of the GenSniper genome and the production of the virion; 2) Constructing the Therapeutic DNA which can be packaged into the GenSniper virion; 3) Construction and characterization of the targeted BioBrick that is responsible for targeted gene delivery. The following wetlab work will demonstrate the synthesis of the GenSniper via the three modules respectively as well as how they work together.
