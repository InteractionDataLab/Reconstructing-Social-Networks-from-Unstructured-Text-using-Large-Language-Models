   Since a significant procedure in gene therapy is to construct vectors to infect target cells and deliver cure gene into them,efficent vectors play a big role. And until now researchers using adenoviruses did a good job, but the production of virus suffers from high cost and low output. This is why we attempt to build a highly productive carrier in the bacteria. We transplanted the structure genes of the phage into the bacteria with specific chimera genes attached to the structural genes. We attempt to engineer lambda phage so that it has similar tranfection function as adenoviruses, taking advantage of their similar structures. We attach the engineered fiber from adenoviruses to phages to achieve better transfection efficiency and specificity. At the same time, we use the cosmid in the phage to carry the cure gene. The engineered phage vectors not only have great capability to carry large and multiple genes, but also can cell specific transfection.
