First, to contruct a standardized Targeted Biobrick for parts registry, where Targeted Biobrick can be served for further use by other teams or researchers. Second, to incorporate Targeted Biobrick into an expression vector pET-28a to test its expression. Targeted Biobrick was contructed via two rounds of PCR.

In conclusion, we have successfully contructed Targeted Biobrick for both part registry and expression (most of the results have not been showed here to make our wiki concise). Of course, the next step should be the characterization of its targeted function.

TB stands for the Targeted Biobrick domain of C-Targeted Biobrick fusion protein. pAC(TB) stands for the agarose gel electrophoresis of pACYCDuet-1+lysis+C-Targeted Biobrick+D+E+FI+FII.

The fusion protein was directly engineered to the synthesized pACYCDuet-1+lysis+C+D+E+FI+FII. Thus, the positive clone, co-tranformed with pET-28a+Nu1+A+W+B, will be able to produce the targeted GenSniper with the desired fiber of defined specificity. However, we chose to characterize the function of Targeted Biobrick firstly according to our synthetic biology background. When we confirm that the GenSniper viroin (encoded by its genome and with the Therapeutic DNA packaged as showed in Module I and II) and Targeted Biobrick (Module III) can work separately. Then the characterization of their co-function (all the three modules) will be more definitive.

Here we chose two production system: the eukaryotic production system of HeLa cells (actually CHO cells might be more appropriate for this production) and the prokaryotic production system of E.coli. The eukaryotic production system has the advantage of a high chance to maintain the cellular and physiological function, while the production procedure might be a little complicated. The prokaryotic production system has the advantage of mass production and easy purification, while the eukaryote-based Targeted Biobrick fusion protein might be vulnerable to denaturation.

The transfection efficiency is quite high.
</P><P>After tranfection and identification of green fluorescence, we purified the total proteins of HeLa cells, because only the desired fusion protein will produce green fluorescence in further characterization.

</P><P>We firstly characterized the Targeted Biobrick generated by the eukaryotic production system. The green fluorescence was not so high as the tranfected vectors encoding the Targeted Biobrick-GFP ORF. Though we slightly prolonged the exposure time of fluorescent microscopy for sensitive detection, the exposure time regarding each group did not change in order to keep the fidelity of the data.

However, the green fluorescence produced by Targeted Biobrick-GFP fusion protein via eukaryotic production system is relatively low. So we recommend researchers to take other eukaryotic production systems, such as a more commonly used CHO cell protein production system, into account.

The result further supports the conclusio made in the previous characterization for the same fusion protein generated by prokaryotic production system. However, the distribution variation of the green fluorescence should be more obvious for observation, which mean the characterization system needs further adjustment.
