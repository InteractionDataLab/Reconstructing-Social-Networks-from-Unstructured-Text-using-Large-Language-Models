Synthesis of Therapeutic DNA
therapeutic DNA construct
Here we introduce another molecular cloning vector to mimic the bacteriophage lambda genome which will be packaged into the virion. What’s more, the synthetic “bacteriophage lambda genome” contains the therapeutic gene(s) needed by the target cells, which will be transported via simulated viral introduction.
We term this molecular cloning vector “Therapeutic DNA”, which consists of a cos site for the package into the virion.The therapeutic gene is for in vivo gene therapy and owns the replication origin of bacteriophage lambda (including O gene and P gene).
