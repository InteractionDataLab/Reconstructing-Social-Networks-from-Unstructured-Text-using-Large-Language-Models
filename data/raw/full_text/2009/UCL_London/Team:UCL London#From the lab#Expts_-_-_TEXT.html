Introduction
After the 4 stress detecting devices been constructed, our team conducted a series of experiments to see how well they could live up to their designed function and also how they react to different stresses that could occur during fermentation. One focus of the experiments was chemicals believed to harm the cell envelope and cause aggregation mis-folded proteins in periplasm.  Another focus of the testing was on responsiveness to very low levels of dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions.
The DegP promoter is activated by the two-component system CpxAR and transcription is initiated by Sigma-E. It was thought to respond to mis-folded protein in the periplasm of E.coli. Various organic and inorganic chemicals which are suggested to cause protein denaturing in bacteria were used to induce protein mis-folding in the experiments. Important chemicals that were involved in our experiments are: Cu2+, Fe3+, NO3-, ethanol (C2H5OH), indole (C8H7N), 1-octanol (C8H18O) and toluene (C6H5CH3).
The Spy promoter is activated by the two-component system CpxAR as well as much the smaller two-component regulon BaeSR. It was thought to respond to similar stress as DegP but be less dependent on the growth phase of the organism. Spy also showed response to some of the chemicals mentioned above. We believe that both DegP and Spy have a high probability of being able to detect mechanical shear stress. But those experiments remain to be conducted.
The NarK promoter is switched on during anaerobic conditions upon binding to the protein Fnr. The sequence also contains binding regions for the protein NarL and should therefore also be weakly activated in the presence of nitrate. The modified NarK promoter (mNarK) was designed to have an optimised higher affinity for Fnr, stronger activity under anaerobic conditions and also to be less influenced by nitrate.
A Series of Growth Curve Experiments (OD&Fluorescent without stress)
Aims
Invesgating the general growth cruve of the host organism (E.coli W3110), with and without iGEM plasmids.
Measuring the fluorescent of the devices under normal condition, i.e. with no stresses at all.
Procedures
Grow –ve control, RPU, degP+GFP device, spy+GFP device, NarK+GFP device and tetR+GFP device in 10ml LB overnight.
Measure the OD of the overnight cultures.
Determine the volume to inoculate in 50ml fresh LB with Kana in a conical flask, in order for all the culture starts to grow at small or similar OD.
Take out samples to measure OD by 1 hour interval, for 6 to 8 hours(various from experiments date).
Measure fluorescent levels after OD measurements.
Take OD and fluorescent measurements after 12 hours of the last measurment mentioned above.
Observation
As shown in the Results.

Immediate result is that RPU loses fluorescent with increasing CuCl2 and loses all florescent for CuCl2 concentrations of 20mM and above and also gain florescent for all Ethanol concentrations with the highest florescent at 600mM (which increases 100%). No other significant result within 1 hour.
Next morning, RPU has lost all florescent for CuCl2 concentrations of 8mM or above.
DegP has increased it’s fluorescent by at most 30% for 4mM CuCl2. Spy is silent without stress and induced for CuCl2 concentrations 2-8mM with highest at 4mM.

Oxygen Level Experiment(Nitrogen and sealed eppendorf tube test)
Aims
Procedures
In the morning inoculate NarK and mNarK from glycerol stock into 2 mL of LB containing 100 µg/L Kanamycin.
OD measurement:
NarK: 0.5, mNarK: 1.3.
Inoculate 100 µL of NarK and 40 µL of mNarK respectively into 3 Falcon 50mL falcon tubes containing 5mL of LB+Kanamycin and 2 eppendorf 1.5mL containing 1.5 mL of LB+Kanamycin (the eppendorf tubes are completely full).
Seal the eppendorfs and apply plastic film around the lids to make sure no gas can go in or out of the tubes. From the Falcon tubes let one have the lid loose and for the other two spurge nitrogen gas into the to get rid of all the oxygen in the tubes.
Spurge nitrogen in a hood to avoid aerosols being released, also contain the tubes in a plastic bag that is also filled with nitrogen.
Spurge nitrogen 3 times 15 seconds into each tube, between each time seal the tube, shake it and let it rest for 30 seconds.
After the tube is sealed the last time apply plastic film to make sure no gas can go in or out of the tube.
Incubate over night at 37°C.
Take Tecan measurements the next morning.
Observation
High fluorescence for the samples with access to oxygen and no fluorescence for all samples without access to oxygen.
Organic Chemicals Experiment(Toluene, 1-octanol, n-octane)

Incubate for 2 hours to 3 hours until they reach mid-log phase, i.e. OD around 1.0 at wavelength 600nm.
Add different amounts of toluene, 1-octanol, and n-octane onto a 96 well plate as stated in the table.1 below.
Add 200µL of E.coli culture into corresponding well.
Measure fluorescent level immediately
