UCL_London iGEM survey
A questionnaire was created in order to get a profound understanding on the opinion of those at UCL as well as the general public's view.
The questionnaire can be seen at the following website:
" http://FreeOnlineSurveys.com/rendersurvey.asp?sid=nnrzscgojwnwv76650008 "
96 completed the questionnaire and the results are shown as follows.
Synthetic Biology unlike Bio-engineering or Biology is a new area in Science and Technology.  Looking at the results from the questionnaire, alot of people do not understand what synthetic biology really is about. The results also convey that people fear that standardised biological parts and devices can be modified and used for the harm of the public.
