The Stress Busters
The Stress Busters were formed in 2009, and consists of the three musketeers. The name the stress busters came under the influence of the film “Ghost busters”. As men on a mission, their role was to seek out the bad ghosts and arrest them. However, the three musketeers at UCL are on a mission to detect any processing related stress levels that the E-coli cells are undergoing. As you can see, our team of 3 is quite small so roles like designing/updating the wikipages,working in the labs and researching are shared between us. The Stress Busters are a tight knit of Biochemical Engineers and Biochemists.
