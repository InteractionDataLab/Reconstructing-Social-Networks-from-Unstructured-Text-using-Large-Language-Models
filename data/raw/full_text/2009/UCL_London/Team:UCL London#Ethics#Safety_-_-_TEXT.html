Safety
This year, all iGEM 2009 teams were asked to state how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Below we have considered the following four safety questions:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
"The Stress Lighter", was designed to detect any stresses that the bacterial cell e-coli was experiencing. The device is not a bio-hazard or a threat to the safety/health of the public. Our idea was based on the vision of visually monitoring the level of stress the cells are subject to.
Moreover, at this present stage in our research, we have not detected any toxic or environmentally harmful chemicals released/produced by our device.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, they are called the "Genetical Modification Safety Committee"
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
They fully approved our project.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No.
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?'
