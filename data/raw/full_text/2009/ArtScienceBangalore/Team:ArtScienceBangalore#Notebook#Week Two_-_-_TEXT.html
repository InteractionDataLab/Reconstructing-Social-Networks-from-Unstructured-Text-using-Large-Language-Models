We still spent the initial part of the week reading up a lot on various topics related to art,science and technology, trying to guage what exactly our project was and could be.
Parallely, we applied our imagination onto various small scale projects such as making our own livin biological sculptures and thinking up ideas of presentation at the jamboree.
However, we were still thinking from the perspective of an art/design student and were applying only our previous background-based understanding.
