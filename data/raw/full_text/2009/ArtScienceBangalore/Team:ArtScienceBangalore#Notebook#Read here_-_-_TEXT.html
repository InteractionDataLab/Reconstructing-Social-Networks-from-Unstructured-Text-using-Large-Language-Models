Extracting DNA from Banana
What you need
3 glass or clear plastic cups
A cup of water
A banana
A spoon
An eyedropper
A strainer
A funnel
A toothpick
A tablespoon of salt
3 Tablespoons of liquid detergent containing Sodium Laurel Sulphate (look at back of the bottle)
A third of a cup of rubbing alcohol
What you need to do
Put the rubbing alcohol in the freezer to chill it.
Mash the banana up with the spoon.
Strain the pulp through the funnel into one of the empty glasses (You might need some water to help it through.)
In another glass stir the detergent and salt together.
Mix the banana pulp and the salty detergent together for about a minute. Try to avoid bubbles.
When it settles, gently pour the alcohol down the side of the cup over the back end of the spoon. The alcohol should form a layer over the mixture.
Soon, you'll see tiny white strands of millions DNA gathering between the two layers.
Pick them out with the toothpick. They should be white, whiter than the rest of the banana pulp. Admire!
