Through the summer, we went around schools and colleges and tried to explain what we were doing. From schools for the urban poor(Drishya) to other design schools(NID). Most of them were intrigued and wanted to participate. We have formed a Facebook group - iGEM India for all Indian iGEM teams to use as a forum and hopefully we'll have more discussions happening there. We also helped create an online resource for artists/designers that want to get involved with biotechnology called Hackteria . Lastly, we are also designing a creative commons/open source Synthetic Biology handbook for Artists and Designers which can be accessed here .
