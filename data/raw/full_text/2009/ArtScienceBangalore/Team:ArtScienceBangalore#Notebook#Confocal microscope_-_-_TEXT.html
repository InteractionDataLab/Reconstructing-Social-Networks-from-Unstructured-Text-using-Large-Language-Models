Confocal Microscope
The Confocal Microscopes are capable of bringing into focus a specific plane of an object, and eliminating all other sources of light. This way the microscope can get cross sectional views of the object without physically cutting the object. The microscope uses a pinhole to eliminate all other light to focus on one plane.But this way the actual light received will be pretty low, so they use heavy duty lasers to beam into the object to excite them and make the produce their own light, or fluorescence. These microscopes can be used to make a 3d reconstruction of the whole object by scanning it plane by plane.
