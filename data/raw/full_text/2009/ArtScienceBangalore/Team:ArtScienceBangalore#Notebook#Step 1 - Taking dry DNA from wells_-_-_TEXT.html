Team:ArtScienceBangalore/Notebook/Step 1 - Taking dry DNA from wells
From 2009.igem.org
What Dry DNA? What Wells?
MIT sends DNA kits with the biological parts needed to construct the required bacteria.
There is a specific procedure for 'taking out' the dry DNA from the kit. The DNA is stored in these pits in the box called 'wells' and below is the standard procedure of extracting the required DNA:
1.Making sure the plates are properly oriented, punch a hole through the foil cover using a pipette - into the well you want the DNA from. Don't remove foil cover since it might pose the threat of cross-contamination between wells.
2. Add 15uL of deionized water - diH2O ( Deionised water is purified water from any source that is physically processed to remove impurities)
