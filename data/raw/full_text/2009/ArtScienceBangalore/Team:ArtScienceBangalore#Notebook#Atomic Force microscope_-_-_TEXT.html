The Atomic Force Microscope
Different from the other microscopes because it doesn't use a lens for imaging. Rather, it uses a cantilever that is can  detect up to a nanometer deflection in the surface texture of the object under scan.
The deflection is measured using a laser spot reflected of the top of the cantilever.
