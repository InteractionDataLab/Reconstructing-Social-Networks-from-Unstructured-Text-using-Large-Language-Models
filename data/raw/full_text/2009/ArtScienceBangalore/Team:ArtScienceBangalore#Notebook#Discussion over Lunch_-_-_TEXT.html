Team:ArtScienceBangalore/Notebook/Discussion over Lunch
From 2009.igem.org
The whole group including Mukund and Yashas sat together at lunch and did a quick recap of the day's activities till then and what we learnt from engaging in each of them. We then discussed our ideas for the iGEM project. While doing this, we also discussed the feasibilty and success rate of each of them. The few major workable ideas that were arrived at were -
- Enabling E.coli to give out the smell of rain  when it secretes dopomine (the enzyme reponsible for the emotion love) - Experimenting with sound and the bacteria's reactions to it in different forms.
The whole idea of using olfactory glands as a sensor for experiments rather than the usual visual or aural glands seems exciting.
