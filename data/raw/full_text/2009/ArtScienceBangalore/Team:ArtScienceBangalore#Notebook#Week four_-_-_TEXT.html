What are we trying to do?
We want the bacteria to lyse, to kill itself from the inside.
Well then, to do that we had to get a lysis gene in it. The thing is, with the lysis gene needs to be turned on by this specific substance called a promoter
There are two kinds of promoters, ones that make the gene they're attached to , be 'on'  all the time.  Then, you have ones that turn on when you want them to, in our case, when you add a mystery enzyme.
Our Step-wise Process:
How we tried to do this:
Step 1 - Taking dry DNA from wells
Step 2 - Transforming competent cells
Step 3 - Picking a single colony.
Step 4 - Inoculating broth with Ampicillin-R (an antibiotic) and letting it grow for 18 hours.
Step 5 - Using the resulting culture for mini-prep. - a process used to purify plasmids and yields clean, usable DNA.
Step 6 - Digesting the DNA
Step 7 - Gel Electrophoresis
Step 8- Ligation
Step 9- Transformation and Inoculation
