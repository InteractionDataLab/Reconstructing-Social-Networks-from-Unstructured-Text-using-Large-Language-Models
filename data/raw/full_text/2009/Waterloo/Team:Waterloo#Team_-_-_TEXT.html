Who we are
The University of Waterloo's 2009 iGEM Team is a dynamic group, consisting of students from the Faculties of Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. We are an undergraduate-run team, with a student Director managing most of our team's affairs and directing our team's ongoing activities. Our enthusiastic Faculty Instructors and Advisors give us the benefit of their experience and, in the case of Dr. Trevor Charles, lab space, and provide us with additional support and guidance in areas related to design, mathematical modeling, lab work and administration.
Because of Waterloo's co-op program, some of our members take courses during the summer, while others work full-time. The majority of our team members participate in the iGEM competition in their spare time, outside of work or school; a few have been involved part-time as part of their research-assistant positions in various labs in the UW Department of Biology. This team structure means that instead of each member taking on one aspect of the project to tackle over the course of the summer, our team collectively works on the project as a whole, each member picking up where the last left off the day before, or even earlier the same day!
UW iGEM Team members are all involved in a unique learning experience: our 2009 team consists largely of students who started with little or no research/laboratory experience and had a range of theoretical knowledge of molecular biology.  A strong desire to learn, combined with proper guidance from more experienced teammates, have aided these students in becoming independent and more comfortable working in a lab environment. Our senior members also have had valuable opportunities to share their experience with others.
