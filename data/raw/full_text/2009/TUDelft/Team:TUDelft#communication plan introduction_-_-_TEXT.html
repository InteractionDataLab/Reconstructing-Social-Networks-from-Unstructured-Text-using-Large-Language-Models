Introduction
iGEM is a multi disciplinary competition and the participants have different scientific backgrounds. The TU Delft iGEM 2009 team has six members, 5 Life Scinece & Technology students and 1 Nanoscience student. During the iGEM competition communication is crucial. Participants have to communicate with different audiences in order to gain sponsorship, media attention, or convince the judges during the iGEM Jamboree etc. Communication with different audiences is crucial in order to complete the competition successfully.
During the recruiting period for TU Delft iGEM 2009, only 10 students were involved. In our opinion the reason for this was that not many students were aware of the iGEM competition. This is an nice example to show why communication is so important.
We set up this communication plan in order to:
Give an overview of the different audiences who we should communicate with.
Give an overview of the inputs we can use in order to address these audiences.
Create a chronological planning of our PR activities during and after the iGEM competition.
Provide the next (TU Delft) iGEM teams an overview and insights about the way we tried to communicate with the outside world.
