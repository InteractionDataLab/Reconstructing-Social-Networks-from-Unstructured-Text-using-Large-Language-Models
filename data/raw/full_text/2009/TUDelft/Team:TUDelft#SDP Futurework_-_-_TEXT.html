Future Work
The most obvious improvement for future work on a self destructive plasmid would be to replace the LVA-tagged I-SceI homing endonuclease in  by a wildtype sequence. I-SceI protein with the wildtype sequence is commercially available and has been shown to work. The restriction site and reporter gene have been shown to work, so these would not require immediate attention. Possibly the restriction site could be integrated into the reporter gene sequence, so that cleavage would immediately block transcription of the reporter gene.
