24 September 2009
We got sequencing results. It was found that the medium control RBS, Normal control RBS, LacI generator sequencing failed. But the locks and keys and negative cascade plasmids were partially confirmed. The Riboregulator plasmids has sequence similarity but not fully correct. Hence we think it is good to drop Riboregulator since we have no time to correct its assembly in which time we can concentrate on characterising the negative cascade plasmids. Today I prepared the culture for miniprep of the LacI generator ligated negative cascade plasmid, riboregulator plasmid and locks and keys. Also I prepared some extra samples for sequencing. Also I prepared cultures for miniprep tomorrow for samples which has to be given for sequencing again (medium control RBS, Normal control RBS, LacI generator) and for reverse primer sequencing.
