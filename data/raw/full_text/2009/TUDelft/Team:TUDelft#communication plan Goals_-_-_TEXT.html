Goals
The goals we defined are differentiated to the specific audiences, as discussed below.
Scientists
We want to inform the scientists who are interested in Synthetic Biology about the iGEM competition, our participation in the iGEM competition, and our project. This is important because we need their knowledge and some of them could be potential sponsors.
In science interested public
We want to inform this audience about Synthetic Biology in general, about the iGEM competition, our participation in the iGEM competition, and our project. We want to have a contribution to the public perception of Synthetic Biology by informing this audience about the possibilities and more importantly the impossibilities of Synthetic biology.
Sponsors and potential sponsors
We want to  inform potential sponsors about our project and inform our sponsors about our progresses. We also want to show them that their contribution to our team, by sponsoring us, is useful and even indispensable. We also would like to interest them for sponsoring next TU Delft iGEM teams.
Students
Life science & Technology students are also able to participate iGEM competition instead of a design course or industrial internship. In order to interest students for the next TU Delft iGEM teams it is important to inform them about the iGEM competition and the possibility of participating iGEM instead of design course or industrial internship. We also want to have a contribution to the next TU Delft iGEM team by recruiting students and promoting iGEM competition among Life science & Technology students. Promoting iGEM competition among students should start earlier and be more intense than past years.
Future students
We want to inform high school students about Syntehtic Biology and our project. We also so want to gain their interest for Life Sciences in general by showing them one of the many possible examples which is our project.
