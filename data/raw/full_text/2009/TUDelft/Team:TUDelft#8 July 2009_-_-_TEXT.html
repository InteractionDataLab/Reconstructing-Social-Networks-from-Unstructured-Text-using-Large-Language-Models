Conjugation
Today, we worked on the entries to the Parts Registry, where we used some parts from the Peking '07 iGEM team and some parts from NCBI. After writing down the sequences for trbC (pilin) of IncP beta R751 plasmid, trbK (entry exclusion) of IncP beta R751 plasmid, I-PpoI homing endonuclease site, I-SceI homing endonuclease site and I-PpoI homing endonuclease into the registry, we used the software Upgene to optimize for the codons, and the optimized sequences were inserted into the Parts Registry.
