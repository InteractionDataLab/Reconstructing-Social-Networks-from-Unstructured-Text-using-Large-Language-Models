</P><UL><LI> Literature research
</LI><LI> Survey 
</LI></UL><P>The ethical research was initially based on the work of the <A href="https://2008.igem.org/Team:TUDelft" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TUDelft iGEM team 2008</A>. The main reason to focus on reductionism and the notions of life was due to its interesting complexity, the lack of literature on this subject linked to synthetic biology, and the <A href="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=166192&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=492968" class="external text" rel="nofollow">talk</A> of Dr. Caplan from the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. The possibility of doing a survey amongst a large group of people involved in synthetic biology seemed a great opportunity to raise the awareness of these complex ethical issues and to gain insight on how the synthetic biology community responds to them.     
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Literature_research">Literature research</SPAN></H2><P>Our approach was to outline the main ethical concerns that appear in scientific literature on synthetic biology. The next step was to investigate these issues and make an overview of the responsibilities of researchers in the field. After categorizing the issues, a choice had to be made on which subject to focus on. Since there are a lot of different issues with distinct implications and consequences, we decided to target the ethical issues concerning life (see <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:TUDelft/Ethics_background" class="external text" rel="nofollow">background information</A>). With both deep philospophical meanings of life but also the science-driven changes of our perception of life, this would be a complex subject to tackle.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Survey">Survey</SPAN></H2><P>The aim of this project was not so much to find solutions to the ethical problems involved in notions of life, but rather to raise awareness on this particular subject, as well as gaining insight in the perception of the iGEM community, a large stakeholder in synthetic biology. For that reason we decided to conduct a survey amongst iGEM participants, supervisors and advisors. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sample">Sample</SPAN></H3><P>Soon after the decision was made, a short e-mail was send to all the primary supervisors of the in iGEM participating teams to see if they would be interested in participating in the survey and whether they (or a different team member) would be willing to distribute the survey amongst the team. Of the 100 teams that were approached, a total of 56 teams replied and were interested in participating. These were I eventually send the survey personally.  With an approximated average of 10 students and 4 supervisors per team, the sample size based on the 56 teams that were willing to participate is roughly 780. After closing the survey, a total number of 242 participants completed the survey, which equals 31% of the sample. After selection based on the outcome, a total of 231 responses were usable for an elaborate analysis.  
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Content">Content</SPAN></H3><P>The survey was constructed with help from Steven Flipse, former iGEM participant and currently a PhD student in the department of Biotechnology and Society at the TUDelft. The questions were mainly based on questions raised in scientific papers, although a few were based on general interest and curiousness. The qualitative nature of the survey gave extra weight to the quality of the questions and answers. The questions needed to be clear, informative, but also short and simple, whereas the multiple-choice answers needed the extra property of fulfilling most of the partiticpants potential answers. The questions and answers were also designed to calculate correlation patterns afterwards. The software tool that was used to create the online-survey is <A href="http://docs.google.com" class="external text" rel="nofollow">googledocs</A>, which automatically saves incoming data in spreadsheet format anonymously. The survey includes multiple-choice questions, scaling questions and one free-to-fill-in open question. The multiple-choice questions all contained the option to choose the <I>other</I>-option, in which the participants can write their own opinion if they feel that the list of given answers is not sufficient. The questionnaire contains 3 optional questions on personal background of the participant, and 20 questions on subjects concerning synthetic biology, ranging from notions of life and the reductionist approach to communication and risk management.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Method_for_analysis">Method for analysis</SPAN></H3><P>Because of the large number of participants in the survey, the analysis of the results was done quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The data was processed using Microsoft Excel, a software tool capable of handling large amounts of data and competent for simple quantitative analysis, such as correlation calculations. 
<B>1.</B> The first step was to filter the results from non-usable data, based on the relevance of open (<I>other</I>) answers. To keep a consistent sample size, contributions containing non-usable answers were completely removed. The answers of 11 survey participants were completely removed, which equals 0.5% of the initial sample. <B>2.</B> With the remaining 231 contributions, the interesting <I>other-</I>answers were identified and labelled for further use. <B>3.</B> Then, the answers were stored in separate spreadsheets for individual assessment of the questions. <B>4.</B> The scaling-questions that were most likely to show correlation were combined and tested for interrelations using equations 1 and 2 (as depicted below). The multiple choice questions were correlated by comparing the abundance of each answer individually.

In general, if there is a series of n  measurements of X  and Y  written as x<SUB>i</SUB>  and y<SUB>i</SUB> (where i = 1, 2, ..., n), then the Pearson correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the correlation of X  and Y.

One of the problems in science in general is the way to communicate research to the public. It gets even more difficult when controversial subjects raise ethical issues that might be hard to understand without any scientific background knowledge. Should the scientific community inform the public about every detail, or is the material to complex to communicate? Should ethical questions be dealt with together, or should the scientific community self-regulate and decide on dilemmas without informing the public?
