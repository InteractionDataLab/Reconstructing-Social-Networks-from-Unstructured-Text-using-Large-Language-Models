New Biobricks Design
We want to test if the algorithm delivers functional locks and keys. In order to do that, we plan to characterize two locks and keys generated by our algorithm. The RBS’s chosen were the weak and medium (biobricks) from the registry. The DNA sequences of these new parts are:

These sequences will be incorporated as new biobricks to the registry and will be used to construct the next assemblies (figures 14 and 15).
CAUTION!!!, the previous sequences are intended to generate a RNA secondary structure after transcription. In DNA synthesis, a similar structure may be formed causing problems. To overcome this problem we, with the recommendations of some members of Berkeley iGEM 2006 , Caltech iGEM 2007 and Peking iGEM 2007 , developed a basic protocol for Lock/key synthesis .
Figure 14. Characterization of lock and key for medium RBS ( B0032 ). Before IPTG induction, GFP will be transcribed but due to the lock the translation will be blocked. After IPTG addition, the production of the key will start and the expression of GFP will lead to fluorescence. The construction was made using the Biobricks R0010 , B0015 , R0040 , J04630 and the new biobricks designed here (LM: lock for medium RBS and KM: key for LM) in a Cloranphenicol biobrick backbone pSB1C3 .
Figure 15. Characterization of lock and key for weak RBS ( B0031 ). Before IPTG induction, GFP will be transcribed but due to the lock the translation will be blocked. After IPTG addition, the production of the key will start and the expression of GFP will lead to fluorescence. The construction was made using the Biobricks R0010 , B0015 , R0040 , J04630 and the new biobricks designed here (LW: lock for medium RBS and KW: key for LW) in a Cloranphenicol biobrick backbone pSB1C3 .
In order to obtain confident data, we also design control biobricks. The construction of these controls is shown in figure 16 and figure 17.
Figure 16. Control for lock/key for “medium” ribosome binding site. The construction was made using the Biobricks R0010 and E0240 in a Cloranphenicol biobrick backbone pSB1C3 .
Figure 17. Control for lock/key for “weak” ribosome binding site. The construction was made using the Biobricks R0010 , B0031 and J04630 in a Cloranphenicol biobrick backbone pSB1C3 .
