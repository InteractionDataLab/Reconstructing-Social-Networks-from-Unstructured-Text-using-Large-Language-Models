Laura said that the RbCl needed for the new protocol for competent cells preparation is out of stock we cant prepare chemically competent cells till we get it (earliest possible on thursday). Also it seems we can get the plasmid backbones amplified and purified only by thursday morning it is fine. But if we dont get the RbCl on thursday we  planned to do electroporation for the assembly done on that day. We made a plan to prepare the electro competent cells tomorrow and perform a test electroporation by tomorrow itself.  Discussed with Laura about the use of the BioTek Synergy instrument which will be used for making measurements of the delay device working and she gave consent to help us by giving a demo of its use in next week by performing a test assay (GFP expression with growth). She too doesn't know too much about the instrument, which is the reason for this test assay.

Performed transformation of the 6x25 µl ccdB resistant competent cells with the 6 plasmid backbones that will be used in the project and plated with corresponding antibiotics.
Calin
Finished gel from yesterday. Looked at protocol for making cells electrocompetent. Miniprep to extract pSB1AK3.

Extracted the plasmid DNA for the cultures incubated yesterday for 3 bio-bricks λp-GFP [R0040], RBS[B0034] and pLacI[R0010].
