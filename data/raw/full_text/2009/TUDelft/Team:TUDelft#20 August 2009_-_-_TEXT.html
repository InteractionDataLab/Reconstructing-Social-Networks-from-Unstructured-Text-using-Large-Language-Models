I planned to do some minipreps of biobricks needed for ribo-regulator tomorrow and hence I cultured them today.
Meeting with Groningen's and Amsterdam's team (see pictures )

We got colonies on yesterdays transformations. RbCl plates had about 20 colonies each, while Electrocompetent cells were hundreds of colonies. Finally an oldfashioned highly efficient transformation. I suspect transformations with larger parts (>1kb) work better.
I inoculated some of the colonies. These are the names of the samples:
R/E stands for RbCl/Electrocompetent (resp) 1C3 stands for the used backbone (pSB1C3) α ß stands for plate numbers 1,2 stands for colony numbers

Growth in assemblies 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A and 5A. 6A failbut we found a biobrick with the same structure and we have it in plates already!!
