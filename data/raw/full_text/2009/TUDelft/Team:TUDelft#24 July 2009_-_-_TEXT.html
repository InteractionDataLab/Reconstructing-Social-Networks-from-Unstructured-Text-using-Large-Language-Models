Sriram
The cultures were grown in all the culture tubes [R0040, J23008, J23031, B0015, K081013, S03335, S03473, I714031, E0840, J23100]incubated yesterday except RBS[B0034] and pLacI[R0010], which may be because the colony we picked for those biobricks were not perfect. The plasmid DNA was extracted from all the grown cultures and stored in -20°C freezer.
The biobricks received from MIT for Delay [S03335, S03473] which were streaked yesterday have the colonies for future.

Glycerol stocks were prepared for the remaining cultures grown in all the culture tubes [R0040, J23008, J23031, B0015, K081013, S03335, S03473, I714031, E0840, J23100]that were incubated yesterday and stored in -80°C freezer.
Daniel
Since the top10 competent cells newly prepared by us using the Openwetware protocol, didn't transform well for Tim Weenink we are in a bit crisis for competent cells. Anyway to make sure whether the cells work or not I did transformation of Biobricks RBS[B0034] and pLacI[R0010] in the newly created top10 competent cells and kept in drawer to grow in the weekend.
Orr
Performed an mfold analysis to find out the secondary structures of the key3c and the lock3c.
Started looking at the COSMIC code that is intended to model conjugation by downloading the source codes.
Calin
Updated Matlab code to fix mRNA / protein confusion. Sent trbK sequence to Tim for Base Clear synthesis. Got growth in all tubes and plates. MIT parts placed in fridge. Tube cultures went to Sriram's miniprep for plasmid extraction. Did some GFP / RFP non-quantitative measurements. These can be done in the gel imaging machine.
The concentrations for the parts which were recultured in the tubes yesterday:
