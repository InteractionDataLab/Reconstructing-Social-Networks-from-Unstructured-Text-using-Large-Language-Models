Lock construction (weak RBS ( B0031 ) example)
1. Choose a RBS and make the complementary RNA strand
5’- UCACACAGGAAACC-3’ RNA
2. Attach the nucleotide sequence UUUGGGUAGAUCAC upstream the RBS. This sequence will be part of the loop and contains a pyrimidine-uracil-nucleotide-purine (YUNR) consensus sequence that shown to be critical for the interaction key-lock.
5’- UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC- 3’
3. (Optional) Attach the scar (UACUAG) and initiation codon (AUG) downstream the RBS
5’- UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UACUAG  AUG -3’
4. Attach the nucleotide sequence GGAC upstream the last construct. This produces two mismatch nucleotides (red section underline).
5’- GGAC UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UACUAG  AUG – 3’
5. Attach the RBS’s* reverse complementary nucleotide sequence upstream the last construct.
5’- GGAUUCCUGUGUGA  GGAC UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UACUAG  AUG – 3’
6. Attach the nucleotide sequence GUA, which is complementary to one part of the scar, upstream the last construct
5’- GUA  GGAUUCCUGUGUGA  GGAC UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UACUAG AUG-3’
To sum-up, a simplified construction protocol is: add the RBS and the RBS’s reverse complementary* in the next sequence inside brackets 1 and 2 respectively.
5’- GUA  [ 2 ]  GGAC UUUGGGUAGAUCAC  [ 1 ]  UACUAG AUG-3’
In this step you have to change (arbitrarily) one nucleotide in the RBS for its complementary before to get the reverse complementary, this will give a mismatch. This mismatch is necessary in order to allow the key to easily open the lock.
Key construction (weak RBS ( B0031 ) example)
1. Choose a RBS and make the complementary RNA strand.
5’- UCACACAGGAAACC-3’ RNA
2. Attach the nucleotide sequence ACCCAAAGUCC upstream the RBS. This sequence is complementary to the loop formed in the lock.
5’- ACCCAAAGUCC UCACACAGGAAACC-3’
3. Attach the sequence UGGUUAAUGAAAAUUAACUUA downstream the RBS. This sequence forms a loop and a helix with one mismatch.
5’- ACCCAAAGUCC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UGGUUAAUGAAAAUUAACUUA -3’
4. Attach the RBS’s* reverse complementary nucleotide sequence downstream the last construct.
5’- ACCCAAAGUCC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UGGUUAAUGAAAAUUAACUUA  GGUUUCCACUGUGA -3’
5. (optional?) Attach the nucleotide sequence AAAAAGCCGAGUUAUUAAUCCGGCUU downstream the last construct. This sequence forms a second loop which may be useful for stability.
5’- ACCCAAAGUCC  UCACACAGGAAACC  UGGUUAAUGAAAAUUAACUUA  GGUUUCCACUGUGA  AAAAAGCCGAGUUAUUAAUCCGGCUU -3’
To sum-up a simplified construction protocol is: add the RBS and the RBS’s reverse complementary* in the next sequence inside brackets 1 and 2 respectively.
5’-ACCCAAAGUCC [ 1 ] UGGUUAAUGAAAAUUAACUUA [ 2 ]AAAAAGCCGAGUUAUUAAUCCGGCUU -3’
In this step you have to change (arbitrarily) two nucleotide in the RBS for its complementary before to get the reverse complementary, this will give a mismatched. This mismatch is necessary in order to allow the key to easily open the lock.
