Sriram
Today is a happy day. I found that the IPTG induced medium RBS control had 4 out of 10 colonies glowing GFP while only 2 out of 9 are glowing GFP in non-Induced. Finally all the positive controls are glowing GFP in uninduced state which proves our theory that high copy number of Chloramphenicol backbone makes the LacI repressor produced less was unable to control large amount of pLacI. Today I did the miniprep of the Normal RBS control and I got a DNA concentration of 262ng/µl. So I electro-transformed the Normal RBS control with the plasmid 1 of negative cascade in a K12 strain and plated it so that I can do the experiment on monday. I also prepared all the samples to conduct a fluorescence experiment tomorrow. I ran a gel with the controls minipreped today. The results are shown below
