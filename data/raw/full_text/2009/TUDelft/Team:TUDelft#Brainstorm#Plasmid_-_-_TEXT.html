Use F plasmid
address problems with AHL signaling
24 hr half-life at 7.5pH means media becomes saturated ( http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1797063 and http://parts2.mit.edu/projects/iap2003/Prakash/index.htm#Challenges )
"important that a degradation mechanism that is faster than the desired period of oscillations be introduced into the system"
solutions previously attempted
aiiA degradation enzyme not secreted
in the paper: S. Basu, R. Mehreja, S. Thiberge, M. T. Chen, and R. Weiss, Spatiotemporal control of gene expression with pulse-generating networks, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 101 (2004), pp. 6355–6360. http://www.pnas.org/content/101/17/6355.full
two relevant experiments from Pulse Regeneration section
first pulse 4hr AHL induction, then cells washed three times with new media, grown 6 hr in fresh media, then second pulse reaches same intensity levels as first
first pulse 6hr AHL induction, then cells washed and resuspended in new media, second pulse can reach same intensity levels as first, after waiting 140 min before addition of second AHL
washing cells not always practical
Implementation
F plasmid modified to have a gene of interest for signal generation and a self destructive endonuclease instead of AHL for cell signaling, F plasmid transmitted by conjugation [15]
Tradeoff (F plasmid vs. AHL): F plasmid has better rate of degradation (tunable) but worse rate of propagation.
From the paper: A comparison of the kinetics of plasmid transfer in the conjugation systems encoded by the F plasmid from Escherichia coli and plasmid pCF10 from Enterococcus faecalis. Andrup L, Andersen K. Microbiology. 1999 Aug;145 ( Pt 8):2001-9. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10463166
"the plasmid's maximal conjugation rate was estimated to be approximately 0.15 transconjugants per donor per minute."
"the donors underwent a 'recovery period' between rounds of conjugative transfer and newly formed transconjugants required a period of about 40-80 min to mature into proficient donors."
F plasmid is very large [16]
oriT sequence in F plasmid initiates rolling circle amplification and transfer of the plasmid to the recipient cell
can knockout oriT from F plasmid (See Berkeley 2006 project https://2006.igem.org/Berkeley2006-ConjugationMain ) and put on smaller plasmid
how to differentiate between donors and recipients, link expression of modified F plasmid to presence of smaller plasmid?
I. Synchronization:
Add F plasmid using electroporation
Allow conjugation to increase F+ population
Induce synchronization and self destruction -> all cells now back to F-
Next pulse, add F+ cells and repeat
modeling paper, Section 4 in particular: Synchrony in a Population of Hysteresis-Based Genetic Oscillators, Alexey Kuznetsov, Mads Kærn, and Nancy Kopell, SIAM J. Appl. Math. Volume 65, Issue 2, pp. 392-425 (2004), http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=SMJMAP000065000002000392000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes
Complex Spatiotemporal Pattern Generation
Instead of signaling molecules use the self destructing F plasmid. Related projects/papers see https://2008.igem.org/Team:EPF-Lausanne/Project
