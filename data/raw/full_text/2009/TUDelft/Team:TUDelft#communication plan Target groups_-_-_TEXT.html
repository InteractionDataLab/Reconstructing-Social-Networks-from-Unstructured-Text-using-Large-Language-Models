Audiences
There are several audiences who we want to approach. We can distinguish the audiences as internal and external audiences. Internal audiences are those who in general have a scientific background in Biotechnology while external audiences are those who in general don't have a scientific background in Biotechnology.
Internal audiences
Scientists
We would like to inform scientists who are interested in Synthetic Biology in general about our project. Therefore we focus on departments in our University like Department of Bionanoscience and Department of Biotechnology. We also focus on Kluyver Centre for Genomics of Industrial Fermentation.
Students
We focus on students of The Delft University of Technology Faculty of Applied Sciences and Leiden University Faculty of Science. Students form these Faculties are potential members for next year's TU Delft iGEM team. We also want to inform students from the other Faculties of these universities about our participation in the iGEM competitions and project.
External audiences
Sponsors and potential sponsors
Sponsors and potential sponsors are an important audience to us, because participation the competition needs to be funded. Potential sponsors are Biotechnology and gene technology companies. Other potential sponsors are the departments of our Faculty (Faculty of Applied Sciences). Our sponsors are mentioned on the Team wiki.
In science interested public
Synthetic Biology is a new field in the Life Sciences and the public isn't really familiar with it. We want to inform part of the public about our participation and project. The public is a very large and complex  audience, therefore we focus on a sub-audience within this audience. We will focus on people who read the science supplement of newspapers.
Becoming students
We also want to inform upcoming students about Synthetic Biology in order to gain there interest in Life Sciences in general.
