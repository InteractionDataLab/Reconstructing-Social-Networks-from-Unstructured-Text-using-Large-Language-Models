Sriram
Today I found that I got 2 different colonies in the plates (LacI generator and Normal RBS Control) left inside desk one very big and clear and others were tiny. I cultured both so that I can do miniprep tomorrow.
Tim Weenink
Did PCR for verificatoin of primer integrity. For this I used last years primers (1 ul of 100mM stock = undiluted), This years primers (1 ul of 100 mM stock = undiluted), 1ul of 25mM of this years primers that were prepared on the 31st of august (= first). 1ul of 25mM of this years primers that were prepared by Sriram and 1ul of 25mM of this years primers that were prepared on the spot.
These reactions were gelled (template DNA was *P, that was shown to give a 1000 bp band before):
Inoculations:
!G2-6 on amp
!H2-6 on amp
!Zg and !Zc on cam and cam&aTc
!G1 in LB, LB&aTc, LB&aTc&amp
!H1 in LB, LB&aTc, LB&aTc&amp
