Analysis
In order to contribute to the public perception of Synthetic Biology, the scientist who are working in this field should communicate to the general public, who is largely not familiar with Synthetic Biology. As young scientists who are contributing to development of Synthetic Biology, we find it important to also contribute to the public perception of this emerging field. We want to inform the public about Synthetic Biology in general, our participation as TU Delft iGEM 2009 team in the iGEM competition, and our project 'Bacterial Relay Race'.
The public is a very broad audience which we can't address directly, therefore we divined the audiences who we can address and we can communicate with, which are mentioned in this communication plan.
We find it very important to inform our audiences objectively and inform them about what is and isn't possible with Synthetic Biology.
