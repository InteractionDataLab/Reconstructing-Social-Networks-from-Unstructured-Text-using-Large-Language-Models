Sriram
I got colonies in all the plates I prepared yesterday (Riboregulator final assembly and Lock and Key 2nd stage assembly). I cultured them today for miniprep tomorrow.

Today I made electrocompetent cells from the E. coli K12 strain. There were four batches, labled A1 through A4, which will be tested for electrocomptence separately.
