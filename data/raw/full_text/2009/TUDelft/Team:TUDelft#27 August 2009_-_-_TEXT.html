Yesterday's gel is shown below. I continued the ligation and electro-transformation of assemblies. I will check the colonies tomorrow and I will be back to lab only on 1st September since tomorrow and 31st August I will be on leave for mentoring job and US visa interview.
Saeed
The overnight colonies were used for miniprep. !Za, !Zb, !Zg and !Zh had the highest DNA concentrations. These were downstream cut and checked on 1% agarose gel for fragment size. Fragment should be 1934 bp.

!Zb and !Zg seems to be ok. !Zh looks a bit bigger, but this also could be because of the gel. !Zb or !Zg should be used for sequencing.
