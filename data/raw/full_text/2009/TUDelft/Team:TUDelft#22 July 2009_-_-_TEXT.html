Sriram
Observed growth in all the 5 culture tubes [BBa_E0040 - GFP, BBa_C0040 - TetR, BBa_C0051 - cl, BBa_I12006 - pLamclin, BBa_E1010 - mRFP1] and at 11 AM the DNA extraction was started and done with miniprep plasmid DNA extraction kit. The DNA concentrations were noted for all the amplified biobrick parts using Nanodrop.

Agarose gel electrophoresis was run for all the 12 amplified biobrick parts with 2µl loading buffer for 20 minutes (17:30 to 17:50) and the gel is stored in fridge to continue with electrophoresis tomorrow.

Prepared the glycerol stocks for the remaining culture of the 9 biobricks [BBa_E0040 - GFP, BBa_C0040 - TetR, BBa_C0051 - cl, BBa_I12006 - λp, BBa_E1010 - mRFP1 of Delay module and BBa_I714031 - OriT-R, BBa_J23100 - strong promoter, BBa_E0840 - GFP generator and BBa_I13522 - pTet GFP of Conjugation module] for future use. The protocol is as follows:
1. Centrifuge 1ml of culture in eppendorf at 8000rpm for 3 minutes at 15°C.
2. Decant the supernatant.
3. Add 1 ml of culture and centrifuge at 8000rpm for 3 minutes at 15°C.
4. Decant the supernatant.
5. Add 1 ml of culture and centrifuge at 8000rpm for 3 minutes at 15°C.
6. Decant the supernatant.
7. Add 1 ml of culture and centrifuge at 8000rpm for 3 minutes at 15°C.
8. Decant 0.5ml of the supernatant.
9. Resuspend the dense pellet throughly, add 0.5 ml of 10% glycerol and store in -80°C freezer.
