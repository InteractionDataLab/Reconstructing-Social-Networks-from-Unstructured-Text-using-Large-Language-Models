Did some minipreps today. Then nanodropped them:

Today I tested the competent cells prepared yesterday. For that I chose a three DNA samples. One is a diluted biobrick λp-rep for testing electro-competent cells, λp-R-GFP-T which had very high DNA concentration and biobrick pSB1K3 containing mRFP which had a normal DNA concentration for the two chemically competent cells prepared by TSS and TMF(RbCl) buffers respectively.
Orr helped me in doing the transformation of chemical competent cells prepared by TSS buffer. I did the transformation of those prepared by TMF buffer and electroporation. I have kept the plates in the draw to check the results on monday.

R751 cells arrived today. Cultures in all pSB4C5 tubes. Did miniprep on all tubes and also made a plate.

Todays gel confirmed that oriT-R digestion failed and pSB4C5 is way too large.
