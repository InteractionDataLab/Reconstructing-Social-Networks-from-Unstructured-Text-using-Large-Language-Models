7 September 2009
I didnt get any colonies in the locks and keys plates. Hence I ran the gel (shown below) to confirm my restricted products. Then I again did ligation and electro transformation of them. Today from weenink I understood that I need to make a positive control. It is very simple. I have to just attach the restricted biobricks pLacI and RBS-GFP-TT. Hence I did it. Sadly all our sequencing samples were failed due to double signal. We have to check the primers.

upstream restircted !P1 was used for assembly with downstream double terminator. After the assembly the plasmide was electro transformed. Cell are plated on medium containing CAM.
Today I also count the colonies of Tim Weeninks tranformation of Friday 04-09-2009.

I made 10 overnight cultures form these plates, I picked one colonie from each plate. From both A4 plates I picked two colonies.
