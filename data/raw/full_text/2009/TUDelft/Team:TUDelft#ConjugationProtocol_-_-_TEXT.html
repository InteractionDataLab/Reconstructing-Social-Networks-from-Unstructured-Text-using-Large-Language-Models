TUDelft Conjugation Protocol
This is the Protocol Used by TUDelft iGEM 2009:
Day 1
Get plates from fridge containing Donor and Recipient.
Make 5 mL cultures with the appropriate antibiotics and leave overnight.
Day 2
Prepare your plates (see tables at the bottom).
Put 1 mL of the overnight cultures into 5 mL tubes. Usually 2 tubes of donors and 2 tubes of recipients.
Test the OD600. You can use the following graph to estimate the time needed for E.coli containing R751 to reach an OD600 value of 0.45 to 0.6.
Place 500 μL of culture into enough 1.5mL Eppendorfs for the conjugation test.
Prepare AB free plates for the conjugation. One plate for each set.
Centrifuge 1 at 3000 rcf for 3 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend in 500 μL LB without AB.
Centrifuge 2 at 3000 rcf for 2 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend in 500 μL LB without AB.
Centrifuge 3 at 3000 rcf for 1 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend in 500 μL LB without AB.
Place cells on ice.
Mix 100 μL of donors and 100 μL recipients in an eppendorf tube and vortex gently.
Centrifuge for 1 min and discard supernatant.
Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 μL of LB.
Put a PALL 0.2 μM filter on top of a AB free plate. Gently pipette the conjugation mix on the filter. Use good sterile technique.
Incubate for 1 h at 37ºC.
Pick the filter from the plate with sterilized tweezers and put it into an 50 mL assay tube with 2 mL of LB broth.
Vortex to re-suspend the cells.
Make serial dilutions in LB broth. Plate in selective antibiotics for donors, recipients and transconjugants.
The following plates are usually made with R = Recipient, D = Donor, and T = Transconjugant. Adjust the Antibiotics to those needed for your particular test.

Day 3
Image your plates in the gel room.
For colonies with GFP use 50 ms exposure with the orange filter.
For colonies without GFP use 15 ms exposure with the upper white light turned on.
