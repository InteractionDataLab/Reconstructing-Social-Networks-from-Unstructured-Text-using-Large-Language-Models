Protocol for Lock/Key synthesis
1) From the Lock/key generator, the RNA and DNA sequences are obtained. Attaching the prefix and suffix to the DNA sequence will deliver the new biobrick sequence as show below (example with weak RBS).

2) Double strand DNA synthesis is more expensive than single strand. Therefore in most of the cases the latest is preferred. However, the new biobricks are intended to generate secondary RNA structures which will also be formed in ssDNA (see scheme 1). Therefore the next steps (see also the scheme 2) might be taken into account.
Scheme 1. ssDNA will for a similar secondary structure than the one pretended in the RNA molecule, which generate problems in DNA synthesis
.
• Attach the prefix (E and X) to the sequence in the position 5’. • Attach only a part of the suffix (only S) to the complementary sequence in the position 5’. • Make small oligonucleotides (half of the original sequence) with overlap regions.

• Order the oligonucleotides. • Use the nucleotides as primers in PCR. One reaction showed to be enough. • Purify the PCR products. • Digest with E and S. Do the same with the favorite plasmid backbone. • Ligate the new biobrick and the backbone.
