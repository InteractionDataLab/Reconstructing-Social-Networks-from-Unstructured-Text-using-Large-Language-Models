Bronze Medal
We registered our team , had a great summer , and will have fun attending the Jamboree.
We successfully completed and submitted our Project Summary form.
We created and shared a description of the Bacterial Relay Race project via our iGEM wiki .
We will present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We entered information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Parts.
We submitted DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry of Parts.
Silver Medal
We demonstrate at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and the construction works as expected , i.e. the delay device integrated by the parts: BBa_K175046 and BBa_K175047
We characterized the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and entered this information on the Parts or Device page via the Registry of Parts. i.e. the characterization of the time-delay device.
Gold Medal
We characterized an existing BioBrick Part and entered this information back on the Registry: Peking 2007's BBa_I714031
We helped another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We developed and documented a new online lock and key (riboregulator) generator that supports the design of new lock and key pairs for different ribosome binding site's
We developed and documented a new tool for modeling conjugation systems . This kind of model had not been created before.
We outlined and detailed a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology focusing on Ethics .
We made a communication plan in order to divine how to inform the public about Synthetic Biology and our achievements and considered contributing to public perception of Synthetic Biology part of our project, which contributes to Human Practices.
