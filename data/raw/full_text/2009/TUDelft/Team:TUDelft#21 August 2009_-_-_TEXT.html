!Fr1n downsteam was cut out agarose gel of 19-08-2009 and extracted by gel extraction kit. After extraction DNA concentration was 3.7 ng/microL. !C was digested by SpeI and PstI and !Fr1n downsteam is ligated into this. This construct is called !Z. After ligation !Z was transformed into electrocompetent cells and grown outside the incubator during weekend.
