Tim Weenink
imaged the gel i ran yesterday:
This is a really ugly gel, because the comb for creating the wells was too long. The bottom of the wells was too thin. Upon removing the comb, some of the bottoms were damaged, making them leak the loaded samples.
The contents of the lanes is as follows:
Sriram
Today I did the miniprep of the assemblies cultured yesterday. The concentrations are given in Calin's section. Also I did restriction of the DNA samples and the gel was run. The image of it is given below with Calin's section.

Growth in all tubes, miniprep was done.
Growth on all plates.

Make R751 wild cells electrocompetent using Knight's procedure.
Did E + P digest on trbK. Did ligation for assembly CB (GFP-gen + oriT-R on pSB1C3) and CE (trbK on pSB1A3).
Made 3 new AMP plates for pKD3, pKD4, and pKD46.
Transformed electrocompetent cells with CB (CAM, timeconstant 4.6) and CE (AMP, timeconstant 4.5) assemblies. Both plates and culture tubes were made. Transformed R751 electrocompetent cells with pKD46, timeconstant 4.2 and left plate in 30C.
Ran a trbK digest with X + P, this was loaded into the last lane in todays 8 well 1% gel and extracted.
Miniprep concentrations were checked by Tim:

First success, got colonies in all the plates which is strange due everybody had difficulties with heat shock method which made us decide to make more electro-competent cells. Me and Sriram prepare these cells today.
From the colonies in the plates I made tube cultures by duplicate, let's wait one night for more growth.
