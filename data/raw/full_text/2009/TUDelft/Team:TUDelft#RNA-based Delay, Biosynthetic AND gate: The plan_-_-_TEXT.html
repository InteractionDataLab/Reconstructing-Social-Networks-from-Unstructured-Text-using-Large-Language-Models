RNA-based Delay, Biosynthetic AND gate: The plan
Figure 12. Biosynthetic AND gate’s Plasmid 1. Upon induction with IPTG, the gene cI is transcribed but the Lock3c (biobrick) traps the RBS avoiding the expression of cI. cI will induce the expression of GFP in the plasmid 2.
Due to the lack of information on siRNA, the enormous advantage and information of riboregulators and the previous works of Isaacs F. 2004 , Berkeley iGEM 2006 , Caltech iGEM 2007 and Peking iGEM 2007 , the riboregulator approach were selected. The construction of the plasmids is shown in figures 12 and 13.
Figure 13. Biosynthetic AND gate’s Plasmid 2. The addition of IPTG will induce the production of the Key3c (biobrick) which will allow the expression of cI and the induction of GFP production.
