Sriram
Today I prepared the samples for fluorescence experiments tomorrow. Due to lack of time I could not wait for sequencing results of LacI generator.
Tim Weenink
Today I did a transformation of gel excised IPTG inducible IsceI generator (!SIII3 and 5) with Srirams Right Flank (E&P) restricted lacI generator.
Saeed Katiraei
