Sriram
Today I did the miniprep of the cultures inoculated yesterday. Also did a restriction to analyse the sizes of the products. It can be seen in the gel image below.
From the gel it is clear that we have all the assemblies of proper sizes. The only troubling thing was the positive control GFP glowing colony gave a correct band while the non-GFP glowing colony is not of proper size. It is possible due to different assemblies that could be got from electroporation of ligated products.
