23 September 2009
Today Esengul helped me in preparing the Basal minimal medium. Finally it will be available tomorrow. I ligated the ribo regulator plasmid and -ve cascade plasmid with lacI generator since I thought it was unnecessary in negative cascade since it was not glowing GFP. Now since controls have LacI generator I must ligate it to the other samples too which I did today and electro transformed.
