Sriram
I got colonies in all plates of heat shock transformation and electro-transformation. All must be checked for their sizes on monday. If it is ok then I can go to the next step of assembly.
Tim Weenink
Did the rest of the assembly transformations. This time TSS and RubidiumCloride chemically competent cells were transformed with all ten constructs. LB medium was used instead of SOC, because all the SOC was used yesterday.
Calin
The long knockout primers and trbK gene arrived. Designed short knockout primers. CA had colonies. But not all expressed GFP:

Made a backup AMP plate for trbK. Rehydrated and electroporated BBa_J13002 (pTet-RBS). Should be able to save some assembly steps by using this part
