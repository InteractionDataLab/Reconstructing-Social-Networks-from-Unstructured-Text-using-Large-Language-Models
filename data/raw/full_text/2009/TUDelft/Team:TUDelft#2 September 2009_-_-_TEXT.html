2 September 2009
Sriram
Today I did miniprep to continue my assembly of riboregulator and locks and keys. I did restriction and ran a gel today to verify it (see below). Then also I continued with ligation and electro transformation of the products.
Tim Weenink
Ligation of !SIII: placI upstream, *T1 (I-SceI) downstream, pSB1C3 backbone. Also did yesterdays ligation (!P) again, because the PCR machine was set to a ligation temp of 37 degrees, where it should be 20.
I inoculated the K12 strain in liquid culture for preparation of competent cells tomorrow.
also did a gel to check all the above.
