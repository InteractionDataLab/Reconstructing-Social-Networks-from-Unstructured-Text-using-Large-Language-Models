We planned to make electro competent cells today but we got the required OD of 0.5 to 1 a bit late. We hoped to make cells if the meeting finishes quicker, but sadly it took longer than expected hence we had to waste the culture that was grown. Laura gave a new protocol for preparing chemically competent cells and also 6 ml of buffer required. We decided to prepare the cells tomorrow, hence I again made some 3 culture tubes of top10 cells.

Got the source code in R for the modelling of conjugation, and already looked at how it works.
