Sriram
I made plates of LacI generator and Positive control. Then also I did a simple experiment by inducing the cultures of the Controls, Negative Cascade and Locks and keys with IPTG. It is found that locks and keys and negative cascade were not glowing GFP both in induced and uninduced state where as Riboregulator and controls were glowing GFP always.

Ligations:
upstream: !SIII5
downstream: !Zg
Backbone: pSB4A5 (tube III)
Upstream: !SIII5
Downstream: !Zg
Backbone: pSB1A3
Analysed rest of !SIII samples on nanodrop: !SIII1: 30.8 ng/ul
!SIII2: 79.5 ng/ul
!SIII8: 55.8 ng/ul
!SIII9: 103.8 ng/ul
!SIII10: 32.5 ng/ul
Did SDS page gel of IPTG induced !SIII3 and !SIII5 strains and non induced controls. !SIII3 showed an extra band between 20 and 30 kDa, which is roughly the expected band length. The lanes of !SIII5 were not very well visible.
Did transformation with the above ligations. These are constructs !G and !H.
