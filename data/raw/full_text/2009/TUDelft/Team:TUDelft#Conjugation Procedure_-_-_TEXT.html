Experimental Procedures
This page contains the step-by-step plan followed by the conjugation team and each steps current status.
Section 1: Helper Plasmid
Section 1: The Plan
Part 1A:
Acquire R751 plasmid ✔
Confirm wild R751 conjugation ✔
Characterize conjugation efficiency ✔
Part 1B: oriTR knockout
Design and order primers needed for λ-red knockout ✔
Acquire knockout plasmids ✔
Knockout oriTR **In Progress**
Verify that conjugation stopped **In Progress**
Characterize conjugation efficiency of Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 with R751 ΔoriTR as helper
Send R751 ΔoriTR plasmid to registry
Part 1C: trbK knockout
Knockout trbK **In Progress**
Verify that conjugation takes place among R751 ΔtrbK cells
Characterize conjugation efficiency
Send R751 ΔoriT + ΔtrbK plasmid to registry
Part 1D: trbC knockout
Knockout trbC
Verify that no conjugation takes place in presence of Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1
Send R751 ΔoriT + ΔtrbK + ΔtrbC plasmid to registry
Knockouts
The λ-red knockout system was selected as the procedure for doing the knockouts. It had previously been used by several people and demonstrated to work ( lambda red , NanoBio , knockout protocol used by Berkeley '06 ). Primers were designed following the standard procedure . The following primers were used (red parts are P1 and P2):
trbK_KO_FWD (70 bp)
CCAGGGCAGCTACCGGGCCAGCCCGGCGCGCACCTGGTAAGGGGGGATTCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC
trbK_KO_REV (70 bp)
GCGGCAGGGCGAGGGTTTTTAGATTGGCTGGCATTCTCATCGTCAGCACCATGGGAATTAGCCATGGTCC
oriTR_KO_FWD (70 bp)
TCGCGCAGATAGCGCGCCACGCTGACGCCCGCCCTCTTGGCGTTCGCCTCGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC
oriTR_KO_REV (70 bp)
TTTCGCTATATCCGTTGCTGCTTTTGCGGCCTGATAGCGCGATAGTTGCGATGGGAATTAGCCATGGTCC
The following verification primers were used (blue portions are on R751 outside the 50 bp upstream region):
trbK_KO_FWD (20 bp)
CACAACTGCGCCAGGGCAGC
trbK_KO_REV (20 bp)
CAGACGAACAGCGGCAGGGC
oriTR_KO_FWD (20 bp)
CTGGCCCACGTCGCGCAGAT
oriTR_KO_REV (20 bp)
TTGTGGCGGGTTTCGCTATA
Linear fragments were created using pKD4 (KAN) as a template using Platinum® Pfx DNA Polymerase. See Results page for more info.
Section 2: Message Plasmid
Part 2A: BioBrick Assembly
Order DNA synthesis for
BBa_K175001 (trbK) ✔
BBa_K175000 (trbC)
Verify that trbK expression blocks conjugation ✔
Place trbK on standard backbone ✔ , sequence ✔ , and send to registry ✔
Amplify and Transform BioBricks needed
BBa_I13522 (pTet-RBS-GFP-term-term) ✔
BBa_I714031 (oriTR) ✔
BBa_J13002 (pTet-RBS) ✔
BBa_E0840 (RBS-GFP-term-term) ✔
Assemble Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1: [promoter][GFP generator][oriT] ✔
Verify Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1 works. ✔
Sequence Conjugation Testing Plasmid 1. **In Progress**
Assemble Conjugation Testing Plasmid 2 [promoter][rbs][trbK][rbs][GFP][oriT] ✔
Verify Conjugation Testing Plasmid 2 works. **In Progress**
Sequence Conjugation Testing Plasmid 2. **In Progress**
Part 2B: Full Communication testing
Electroporate Conjugation Testing Plasmid 2 into some R751 ΔoriT cells creating InitiatorCells (select for presence of both message and helper plasmid)
Add InitiatorCells to a culture of R751 ΔoriT + ΔtrbK and observe signal propagation, characterize rate of signal propagation. Look for lethal zygosis issues.
If signal propagation observed, do victory dance.
