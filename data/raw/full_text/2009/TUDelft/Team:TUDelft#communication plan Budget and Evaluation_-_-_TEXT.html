Introduction Analysis Audiences Goals Key messages Tactics and Inputs Planning Budget and evaluation Recommendations
Budget
There are only two items's for which a budget is needed, the others will be costless.
Second meeting with Groningen iGEM 2009 team. During their visit to Delft we will serve lunch and drinks. Estimated costs are € 100.
To promote iGEM 2010 competitions and participation of Life Science&Technology students in the TU Delft 2010 team, posters and flyers are needed. Also the lunch meeting for Life Science & Technology students will have some costs. Estimated budget is € 75.
Total costs will be € 200, this includes € 25 for contingent expenses.
Evaluation
Unfortunately it is not possible for us to evaluate the effects of our communication strategy for every single audience. In order to evaluate the effects to every single audience much more time, people and resources are needed than are available to us during this project.
We are able to evaluate the effects on two different audiences.
Scientists
We do not have enough time and resources to evaluate this audience. We will only be able to evaluate this audience inside our faculty TNW. Since some groups in this audience are also sponsors it is more efficient to evaluate as sponsors.
In science interested public
This audience is too big and complex for us to evaluate. Evaluating this audience needs much more financial resources than are available to us.
Sponsors and potential sponsors
This audience is easy to approach and to evaluate. After the Jamboree we will present them with a survey about the cooperation and sponsoring of our team. We also would like to know if we came up to their expectations as sponsors.
Furthermore we would like to ask them if they are interested in sponsoring future TU Delft iGEM teams.
Students
This audience is also easy to approach and to evaluate. After promoting iGEM we are able to see how many Life Science & Technology students are familiar with the iGEM competition. Furthermore we are able to evaluate this audience by comparing the number of applications and the teams size of TU Delft 2010 team with previous years.
Future students
This audience is too big and complex for us to evaluate. Evaluating this audience needs much more financial resources than are available to us.
