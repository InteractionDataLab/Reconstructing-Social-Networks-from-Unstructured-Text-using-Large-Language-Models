I helped Daniel making some plates, as well as made some more LB medium.

Today I minipreped the Riboregulator Assemblies 5,6,7, 8 (Check 24th August Lab notebook) along with the BBa_S03335 in Chloramphenicol backbone. Then I restricted the samples and ran a gel. Since the staining needed overnight check the image in tomorrow's notebook.
