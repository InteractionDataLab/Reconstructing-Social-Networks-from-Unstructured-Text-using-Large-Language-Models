Sriram
I did fluorescence experiment as shown here for negative cascade sample, locks and keys and their corresponding controls. Unfortunately the results looked same in both uninduced and induced state. Domenico suggested to ask Emrah to get something from the results. I got nice GFP glowing positive control on plate. So I prepared the overnight cultures for samples to be tested tomorrow.
