Team:UC Davis/pH Sensor/promoters
From 2009.igem.org
Why is There a Need to Test Different Promoters Responsive to the ChvI Gene in Our System?
In response to environmental stimuli, due to the amino acids similarity and common mechanisms of different genes, there is a chance of cross-talk among our pH sensor device’s promoter and the genes already present in the E. coli cells (6). To minimize the effects of cross-talk in E. coli, we need to find a gene that does not have a response to any other environmental changes other than an acidic environment.
