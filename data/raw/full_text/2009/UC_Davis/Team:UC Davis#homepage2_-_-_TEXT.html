It is estimated that about one in every 133 Americans suffer from an autoimmune disorder called Celiac Disease (14, 11). Celiac Disease is a condition where the small intestines of an affected individual cannot digest gliadin, a protein present in gluten. When consumed, gliadin kick starts immune system responses, whose side-effects are, but not limited to abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea and vomiting (14). One of our teammate’s friends is currently suffering from this illness, which interested us to look into Celiac Disease as the focus of our project. Currently, the only accepted treatment for this disorder is adhering to a gluten-free diet (14, 12). This can be very difficult as great varieties of food contain gluten. This inspired us to design a probiotic organism that could survive and take residence in the stomach where it would secrete an enzyme that can degrade gliadin.
           This synthetically engineered bug should be able to satisfy at least two main criteria. First, it should be able to survive ONLY in the stomach and, secondly, secrete an enzyme that can degrade gliadin. 
           We have decided to focus our summer project on building two key elements required for our “dream bug”. Therefore, our project has been split into two tasks:
                1. Produce an inducible secretion system
                2. Construct a biological pH sensor limiting this secretion system to the system
