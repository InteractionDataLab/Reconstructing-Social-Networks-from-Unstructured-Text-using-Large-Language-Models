PhoR to ChvI
 
 
PhoR-->ChvI
            It has been hypothesized that due to the amino acid similarity of ChvI to PhoB, ChvI is able to act as a phosphate regulator in E.coli as a PhoB substitute (3).
            Since ChvI showed no abnormal activity inside Agrobacterium tumefaciens under phosphate limitation, it cannot serve as the primary phosphate regulator in A. tumefaciens (3).
            Note: ChvI was not required for phosphate regulation in A. tumefaciens (3), but it might be involved in phosphate regulation in A. tumefaciens in some way (3). Therefore, the possibility of crosstalk still exists
      Due to the structural similarity of ChvI and PhoB, the possibility of crosstalk exists (3).
    Note: Since we are going to use E. coli as our model chassis for this project; we had to make sure that our proteins will keep their characteristics of our interest after being placed inside the E. coli. For example, VirG gene (promoter 1) after being introduced into E. coli cells, started to behave as if it were a member of phosphate regulon (note: PhoB function was necessary for virG induction by phosphate starvation)(6). Studies have suggested that the reason for this behavior was due to the fact that virG promoter 1 has two hexamer blocks which have the same positions as the pho genes (6).
            Studies have shown that ChvI probably activated Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) activity by activating transcription of PhoA (PhoA also gets activated by PhoB) (3). It was not proven that ChvI activates other PhoB-dependent promoters or recognizes the same DNA sequence as PhoB (3). However, there has been speculation that since PhoR mediates PhoB phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, it may do the same to ChvI(3).
            Therefore, the best option would be to find a promoter from A. tumefaciens that gets activated by ChvG/ChvI, a two-component regulatory system only; and does not interact with any E. coli system.
