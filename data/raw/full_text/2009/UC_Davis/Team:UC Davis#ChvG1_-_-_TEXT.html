ChvG
 
ChvG
           ChvG is the sensor kinase of two component regulatory system in Agrobacterium (2).
           Acidic condition plays an important role in Agrobacterium-plant interactions (1).Numerous studies have investigated the possible connection between the physiological response to acidic conditions and the activity of ChvG and ChvI. Studies have shown that ChvG /ChvI two component systems specifically get induced in an acidic environment (1).
            As a result, there is growing consensus that the ChvG/ChvI, two-component regulatory system, may be the primary global pH sensor in Agrobacterium Tumefaciens and as such, serves in coordinating the expression of acid-induced genes (2).
