From 2009.igem.org
Our Approach
Gliadin induces an immune system response when it is absorbed into the blood stream through the small intestine. We plan to take advantage of this by breaking down gliadin in the stomach before it reaches the small intestine. We have developed a secretion system to release an enzyme that can break down gliadin. Also, in order to prevent our delivery system from taking residence anywhere outside of the stomach, we plan to incorporate the difference in pH between the stomach and small intestine with a pH-inducible apoptosis system. By adopting these two systems, we will create a pH-moderated secretion system.
Unlike other suggested treatments requiring the consumption of capsules or tablets, our method of using E. coli as our delivery system is more cost- and time-efficient.
