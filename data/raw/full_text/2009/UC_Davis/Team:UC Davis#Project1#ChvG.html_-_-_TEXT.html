ChvG
           ChvG is the sensor kinase of a two-component regulatory system found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (2).
           Acidic conditions play an important role in Agrobacterium-plant interactions (1).Numerous studies have investigated the possible connection between the physiological response to acidic conditions and the activity of ChvG and ChvI. Studies have shown that ChvG/ChvI two-component systems specifically get induced in an acidic environment(1).
            As a result, there is growing consensus that the ChvG/ChvI two-component regulatory system may be the primary global pH sensor in A.tumefaciens and as such, serves in coordinating the expression of acid-induced genes (2).
