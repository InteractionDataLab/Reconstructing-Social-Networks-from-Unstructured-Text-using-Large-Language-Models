We are now proceeding two projects simultaneously. Below is the abstract of each plan.
1)Reconstruction of mitochondria (or chloroplast), 2)Gene Switch Depending on Duplication.
Project Abstracts
Reconstruction of mitochondria
What will happen when "prepared" liposomes are injected into a cell ? What  is the difference between cells and endosymbionts ?
