Safety issue
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:  ・In our project “GSDD”, we try to deal with environmental problems that might be caused by applications of bioengineering technologies to our daily life.  Our devised system provides a unique way to control the lifespan of genetically engineered microbes and to thus avoid their deregulated spread.
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?  ・Laboratory of Science Communication and Bioethics (which belongs to the Graduate School of Bioscience, Kyoto University) works to make biological researches carried out at our institution transparent to society.  For detailed information on their activities, please cite at the web sites below. [1] [2]
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?  ・We always counsel our advisor before carrying out the experiments we designed. He knows Mr.Kato, the assistance professor in the lab mentioned above, very well, and he assures that we abide by the guideline proposed by the lab.
4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?  ・No, we don’t think so.
