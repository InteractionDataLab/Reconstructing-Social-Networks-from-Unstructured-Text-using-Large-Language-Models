Tuesday, 13 October
To Do
sequence
sig-GFP generator
sig-EGFP generator(HeLa)
Results
We assured that the plasmid include the correct sequence by analyzing it with sequencer.(091015)
Wednesday, 14 October
To Do
No experiments were undertaken
Thursday, 15 October
To Do
Experiments to approach subgoalA
Making of liposome by natural swelling method and extruder
Friday, 16 October
To Do
Experiments to approach subgoalA
Making of liposome by natural swelling method and extruder
expression in vitro HIV-TAT-(LALAAAA)3-generator
add liposome to HeLa cells
Results
No NBD-PE signal was observed in HeLa cells.  This might be because we did not collect the right fraction after density gradient centrifugation and thus lost the liposomes.
Saturday, 17 October
To Do
Experiments to approach subgoalA
add liposome including synthesized HIV-TAT-(LALAAAA)3 peptides to HeLa cells
Results
No NBD-PE signal was observed in HeLa cells.
Sunday, 18 October
To Do
observation by microscope
Results
We could't confirm that liposome was not taken by HeLa cells.
