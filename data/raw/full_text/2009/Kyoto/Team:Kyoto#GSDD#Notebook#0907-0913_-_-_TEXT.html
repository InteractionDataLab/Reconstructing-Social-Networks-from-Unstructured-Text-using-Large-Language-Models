This indicated that annealing product was not obtained.
Transformation
(5)A,(5)B:Colonies were observed.
(7)A,(7)B,(8),(10)A,(10)B:No colony was observed.
Wednesday, 8 September
To Do

Colony PCR of (1),(4),(5)
This result indicates that each part were inserted properly.
Thursday, 9 September
To Do
PCR products(1)(4)(5)(0908)
Gel extraction
Measure  concentration (See lab note on 8 Sept.)
PCR product(5)
Miniprep and make master plates
(7)(8)(10)
Ligation
Transformation
Make parts(for flush end ligation) retry
Annealing
Restriction Enzyme Digestion
Ethanol precipitation
Results
(7),(8),(10)
We failed in the transformation 0907 because of the plasmid we used. We tried again using plasmid we purified anew.
PSB1A2(ES) conc.: 24(ng/ul)
After transformation, colonies were observed in all plates.
Make parts(for flush end ligation) retry

Friday, 10 August
To Do
(7)(8)(10)
Colony PCR
Electrophoresis
PCR
Results
(7)(8)(10)
Inserted properly
(7)A①③,B②
(8)①
(10)A①②③,B②③
This result indicates that some samples were inserted properly, though others were self ligated.
PCR
This indicates PCR was achieved.
