Method for Subgoal A --- Liposomes with HIV-1 TAT peptide
Subgoal A is the construction of a liposome that penetrate through cell membranes.
Construction of Liposomes with HIV-1 TAT peptide
We designed a liposome with HIV-1 TAT peptide.
HIV-1 TAT is a Protein Transduction Domain (PTD)[2]. Liposomes made of peptidolipid with HIVｰ1 TAT is known to penetrate through cell membrane[1]. It is suggested that HIV-1 TAT promotes endocytosis,though the precise mechanism remains unclear.
Then we fused HIV-1 TAT with potential anchor proteins (LALAAAALALAAAALALAAAA)[3]. The LALAAAA side of this fusion protein is expected to be anchored in the lipid barrier of liposome. And the TAT side of the protein will be exposed to water so that TAT domain can touches the cell membrane. When exposed to cells, liposomes with this fusion protein will promote endocytosis and be taken into the cell. If such liposomes are fluorescent stained, they will show fluorescence in the cells.
We constructed plasmids encoding this fusion protein, referred to as (HIV-TAT)-(LALAAAA)3-generator in Parts section.
When this plasmid is mixed with mixture of liposomes and cell-free protein synthesis system, the fusion proteins will be synthesized and anchored on Liposomes[4].
We also performed similar experiments with chemically synthesized TAT-LALAAAA protein.
Method for Subgoal B --- Liposomes with Mitochondrial Translocases
Subgoal B is the construction of a liposome with mitochondrial translocases and the confirmation that mitochondrial proteins are imported into it.
Construction of Liposomes with Mitochondrial Translocases
Mitochondria have several types of translocases: TOM40 complex on outer membrane, TIM22 complex, TIM23 complex and OXA complex on Inner membrane. They catalyze protein transportation across mitochondrial membrane. Precursor proteins with signal sequence for mitochondrial protein import are selectively sent to mitochondria[5][7][8].
We aimed to reconstitute all types of mitochondrial translocases on liposomes but later found it too difficult. Mitochondria have double-membraned sturucture, which we can hardly construct well. So, we decided to construct liposomes which correspond to mitochondrial Inner membrane.
It is known that mitochondria without their outer membrane, which is called mitoplasts, can efficiently import precursor proteins into the matrix space. It means that TIM23 can recognize signal sequence and catalyze protein tranport if exposed on their surface.
So if we successfully reconstitute liposomes with TIM23, these liposomes will take in proteins with mitochondrial signal sequence too.  We named such liposomes "Prepared Liposomes".
Prepared liposome is constructed in the ways described below[6][12].
Isolate mitochondrial fraction.
Disrupt outer membrane.
Mix mitoplasts with detergent.
Mix liposomes with mixture of the 3 steps
Get rid of detergent.
GFP with Mitochondrial Signal Sequence
We designed GFP with mitochondrial signal sequence, which we named this sig-GFP, and constructed plasmids encoding it, referred to as sig-GFP generator in Parts section. And we isolated mitochondrial fraction from yeast to confirm whether sig-GFP is imported into mitochondria in vitro. Mitochondrial fraction is mixed with cell-free protein synthesis system expressing sig-GFP. If sig-GFP works well, mitochondria will be filled with GFP[9][10][11]. And it means sig-GFP can be imported into prepared liposome too.
Method for Subgoal C --- Liposomes with HIV-1 TAT and Mitochondrial Translocases
Subgoal C is construction of Liposomes with HIVｰ1 TAT and mitochondrial translocases, and confirming whether they go into host cells and import mitochondrial proteins there.
sig-EGFP expression in HeLa
We constructed plasmids for HeLa cells to make them express sig-EGFP. When sig-EGFP is expressed in HeLa, it will be imported into mitochondria as a pseudo mitochondrial protein and fluorescence willl localize to mitochondria. If prepared liposomes successfully get into those transformed HeLa, in the same way, localization of  fluorescence to prepared liposome will be shown. If we observed the localization, it is suggested that real mitochondrial proteins could also be imported into those prepared liposomes.
