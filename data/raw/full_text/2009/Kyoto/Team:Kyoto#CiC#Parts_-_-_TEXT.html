Part design
In this project, we designed two plasmids for RTS(Rapid Translation System, Roache); 1. HIV-TAT::(LALAAAA)3 expressing vector,  2.Signal for TIM23 complex::GFP expressing vector,  and one plasmid for HeLa cells; Signal for TIM23 complex::EGFP expressing vector for HeLa cell. Both 1 and 3 have T7 promoter, terminator and their CDS between them. They can express each protein by RTS. Both parts are inserted in high copy number plasmid pSB1A2.  3. is made by inserting Signal for TIM23 complex into pEGFP-N3.
