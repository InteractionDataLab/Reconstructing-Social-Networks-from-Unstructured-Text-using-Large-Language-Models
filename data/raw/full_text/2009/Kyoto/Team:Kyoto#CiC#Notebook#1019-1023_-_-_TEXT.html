Observation
1019-1025 :Obserbation
Monday, 19 October
To Do
subgoal A --- Confirmation of function of TAT-liposome
observation by microscope
Subgoal B --- Liposomes with Mitochondrial Translocases
Mitochondoria isolation
expressing sig-GFP in vitro with mitochondoria
Subgoal C --- sig-EGFP expression in HeLa
transfomation
Results
subgoal A --- Confirmation of function of TAT-liposome
Liposome was taken by HeLa cells.See the results .
Subgoal C --- sig-EGFP expression in HeLa
sig-EGFP was made a localization in mitochondoria. See the results .

Results
See the results .
Wednesday, 21 October
To Do
subgoal A --- Confirmation of function of TAT-liposome
making liposome by natural swelling method and extruder
add liposome to HeLa cells
Results
According to the expectation,HIV-TAT-(LALAAAA)3-generator may work. Liposome is taken by HeLa Cells. See the results .
