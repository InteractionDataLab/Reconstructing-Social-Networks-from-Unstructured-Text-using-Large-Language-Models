Observation
0928-1004 : constructing sig-GFP generator and sig-EGFP generator(HeLa)
Monday, 28 September
To Do
sig-EGFP generator(HeLa)
Restriction Enzyme Digestion(Hind3)
Results
They were unexpectedly digested by Hind3,the Restriction Enzyme which would not work if the signal sequence were inserted in the vector correctly.
Tuesday, 29 September
To Do
sig-GFP generator
PCR(the second PCR)
sig-EGFP generator(HeLa)
phosphorylation signal sequence primer
annealing signal sequence primer
Restriction Enzyme Digestion(EcoR1 + Xho1)
ligation
transformation
Results
No colony was observed (090930)
