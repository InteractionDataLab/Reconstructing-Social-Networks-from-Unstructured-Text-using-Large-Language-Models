Gel extraction
Two binds were included this site, however, we couldn't and didn't have to distinguish them.
(Discussion) 2M had two kinds of plasmids, one was inserted 900bp,the other was inserted 600bp. So,2M②E-X that was extracted from agarose gel included two kinds of DNA. However, because we wanted to make only many repeats of lbinding sites of lacI, we didn’t distinguish them.
Transformation
colony were observed.
