University of Bologna
The University of Bologna is the oldest continually operating degree-granting university in Europe, the word 'university' being first used by this institution at its foundation. The true date of its founding is uncertain, but believed by most accounts to have been 1088. Since 2000, the University's motto has been Alma mater studiorum (Latin for "fostering mother of studies"). The university of Bologna received a charter from Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the birth of the University back to 1088, making it arguably the oldest university in the world. The University of Bologna is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law.
The University counts about 100,000 students in its 23 faculties. It has branch centers in Reggio Emilia, Imola, Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini and a branch center abroad in Buenos Aires. Moreover, it has a school of excellence named Collegio Superiore di Bologna.
The spread of the first degree course in Cesena dates back to November 1989, but actually the idea of a university in Cesena was conceived a long time ago. As a matter of fact, it was during the 16th century that a public studio was opened for the first time. In 1675 Pope Clement X declared the privileges "Universitatis Caesenae eiusque Collegiorum et Collegium Juristarum amplioribus facultatibus decoratur" and in 1796 Pope Pius VI recognized the legitimacy of the degrees granted by Cesena's Studio.
Today the University seat of Cesena is characterized by predominantly scientific academic offerings and coordinates the activities of three locally-based Faculties (Architecture, Engineering II and Psychology) and of other decentralized degree courses from the Faculties of Agriculture, Veterinary Medicine, Mathematical, Physical and Natural Science, all based in Bologna.
The University in Cesena can also boast qualified research structures, which represent a resource for the institutions and the companies operating in the territory - they enhance innovation, competitiveness and international relations. The Polo Scientifico-Didattico of Cesena realizes projects aimed to increase the quality of higher education, to guarantee suitable services to students, to support the development of research, and to give momentum to relations between universities and companies.
In the last decade, Cesena has become a university city, a centre of high studies and research for thousands of students from all over Italy and from other countries. This important outcome comes from a great dream nourished by local municipal authorities in the last decades - the union of local tradition and history with a high quality academic offer in order to bring up new generations with a highly professional and knowledge standards.
