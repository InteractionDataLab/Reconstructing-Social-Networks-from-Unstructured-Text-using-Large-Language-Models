Up
Week 2: from 07/27/09 to 07/31/09
In order to build up our circuits, we started looking for stardard plasmids.
We needed one high and one medium copy number vector, with different antibiotic resistance (A & K). We searched the Registry and we chos two possible combinations: pSB1K3 with pSB4A3 or pSB1A2 with pSB3K3.
Transfomation of:
pSB1A2 -> with BBa_J23100 and BBa_J04031 from our part library
pSB4A3 -> with BBa_J04500 and BBa_J04031 from our part library
using Top10 competent cells.
Inoculation, miniprep preparation and digestion, checked on agarose gel.
Eluition and Transfomation of:
pSB1K3 -> from 2009 kit, with BBa_J04450
pSB3K3 -> from 2009 kit, with BBa_J04450
using Top10 competent cells.
Since neither pSB1K3 nor pSB3K3 yielded colonies, we tried another transformation, choosing different kit wells.
Eluition and Transfomation of:
pSB1K3 -> from 2009 kit, with BBa_P1010
pSB3K3 -> from 2009 kit, with BBa_P1010
pSB3K3 -> from 2007 kit, with BBa_P1010
using DB3.1 competent cells.
Inoculation, miniprep preparation and digestion checked on agarose gel of pSB3K3 (2007 kit).
(the only one that yielded colonies)
We decided to use pSB1A2 as high and pSB3K3 as low to medium copy number as they revealed right MW bands when checked with agarose gel. In the meantime, we requested another pSB1K3 with BBa_P1010 from the Registry.

2547_RBS_GFP_T on pSB1A2
1429_RBS_GFP_T on pSB3K3 + 2547_RBS_GFP_T on pSB1A2
We made another cloning attempt for CIS, TRANS_4 and TRANS_7

Control digestion checked on agarose gel revealed wrong MW bands
Up
Week 6: from 08/24/09 to 08/28/09
In order to confirm the promoter ratio we decided to study the different GFP production without degradation tag (E0040) on pSB3K3 under J23100 (2547) and J23118 (1429)
Ligation of
2547_I13504 on pSB3K3

2547_I13504 on pSB1A2
1429_I13504 on pSB1A2
Transformation in DH5α competent cells
Control digestion checked on agarose gel
Experimental measures failed because GFP levels were too high to detect significant differences. We decided to use GFP with degradation tag (J04031 instead of E0040)
New annealing of CIS, TRANS_4 and TRANS_7
Purification from agarose gel of the annealed parts
X-P Digestion of:
CIS
TRANS_4
TRANS_7

We checked colonies with colony PCR
PCR Colony: CIS on PSB4A3 in the first well, CIS on PSB3K3 in the others
Only one colony from the ligation on PSB4A3 revealed correct MW band (about 300bp), but the plasmid isolated from this colony revealed wrong MW after digestion checked on agarose gel
Same results were obtained for TRANS_4 and TRANS_7 parts: colony PCRs seemed right, but we found wrong MW bands after checking on agarose gel.
Up
Week 8: from 09/07/09 to 09/11/09
We received primers and we made PCR of our 3 parts. (We used as primers standard prefix and suffix sequences). We made PCR both from annealed parts and from single strands, and we chose to extract the latter, because of the smears when checked on agarose gel.
PCR of CIS-repressing and TRANS-repressor with primers
New digestion of CIS, TRANS_4 and TRANS_7 extracted from gel
Ligation on pSB1A2 yielded no colonies at all
Since the restriction enzymes efficency is considerably reduced when there aren’t enough bases near their restriction sites, we started thinking that digestion could be our critical passage. We ordered longer primers, adding 7 bases to the end of each part. The added bases were the same for all standard vectors.
In order to analyse the high/low copy number plasmid ratio we decided to study the production of GFP without degradation tag on both pSB1A2 and pSB3K3, using 1429 promoter to avoid GFP saturation. Transformation of:
1429_I13504 on pSB3K3
1429_I13504 on pSB1A2
Up
Week 9: from 09/14/09 to 09/18/09

Up
Week 12: from 10/05/09 to 10/09/09
Thinking that our cloning problem was still due to wrong digestion, we made another attempt:
X-S digestion of TRANS_4 (we choose only one of our parts, since it was only a try)
Ligation on pSB1K3 with BBa_P1010
Transformation on DH5α chemically competent cells
Colony PCR made with two different primers revealed correct MW bands.
Colony PCR with standard Prefix and Suffix as primers: inserts were all at about 100bp as expected
Colony PCR with standard VR and VF2 primers: inserts were all at about 300bp as expected (100bp is the length of our parts and 200bp are nucleotides due to primers’ binding on plasmid)
Up
Week 13: from 10/12/09 to 10/16/09
Experimental measurement
Shipment of our parts to the Registry
Up
