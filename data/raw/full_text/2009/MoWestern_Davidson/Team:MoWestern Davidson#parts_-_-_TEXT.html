Characterization of Pre-Existing Part in the Registry
pLacIQ1 Promoter BBa_K091112 is an exceptionally strong promoter that has been documented.
The MWSU/Davidson iGEM 2009 team sequenced this promoter isolated from cells that had grown for several weeks when we obtained gel results indicating that the part might be too large. The team found that there was a 35 bp spontaneous insertion within this promoter directly before the suffix. We believe that the E.coli cells may have mutated the promoter to silence its activity in an effort to conserve energy and select against an attribute that did not necessarily improve its fitness. Here is the 35 bp insertion:
TGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACA
Our experience with this part and our conclusion concerning the mutation have been added to the promoter description in the Parts Registry so that other teams will be aware of this unique possibility. Users are encouraged to sequence parts using this promoter during the construction process. We have some versions that are wild-type and others that are mutated. If you build a new version yourself, do not maintain the plasmid in cultures for very long. Freeze down a stock as soon as possible to avoid the introduction of a silencing mutation in the promoter.
