Summary
Our team is an interdisciplinary group composed of biology and mathematics subgroups collaborating between two different campuses, Missouri Western State University (MO) and Davidson College (NC). Missouri Western State University (MWSU) and Davidson College are 1,032 miles/1,660 km apart, so our collaboration involves cyber meetings, wiki postings, Wiggio shared space, Skype communication, and two campus site-visits.
During the first week of our 10 week project, MWSU traveled to Davidson for 5 days to determine what our project would be. During week 10, Davidson traveled to MWSU to produce the wiki, PPT and poster.
Our campuses have no graduate students or postdocs. Our team is composed of 1 high school student and 13 undergraduates majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, art, psychology, secondary mathematics education as well as some who have not declared their majors yet. We have sophomores, juniors, and seniors on our team.

Conducting synthetic biology research with undergraduates is the most fun I have ever had doing research.  I love helping students to work together as a team, explore their creativity, and contribute to the growing synthetic biology research community.
Dr. Laurie Heyer
Year: More senior than you might think
Major: Math with a concentration in Bioinformatics
Hometown: Azle, TX; now Davidson, NC
