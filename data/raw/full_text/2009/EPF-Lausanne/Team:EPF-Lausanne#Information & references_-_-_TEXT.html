VMD informations
VMD is used to visualize molecules. It is quite user friendly.
A tutorial for VMD can be found here .
NAMD informations
NAMD performs minimization and equilibration.
A tutorial is on the same page as for VMD, here .
NAMD 2.7b1 User's Guide
Summary of parameters setting
Run a simulation
A simulation is composed of different steps. Here are a few links that deal with heating and stabilization.
Building Gramicidin A: Equilibration : protocol uses a single .conf file, heating process is too fast.
NAMD notes from Robinson Lab : a really nice heating process, but involves different .conf files, which is really painful.
