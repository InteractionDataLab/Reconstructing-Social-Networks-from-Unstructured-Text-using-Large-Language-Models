The model
The simulation of the expression of the RFP protein activated by the lovTAP in the Read Out 2 circuit was obtained by the following model:
1. LacI --> LovTAP
2. LovTAP --> LovTAP* (activated form of LovTAP due to a light-induced conformational change)
3. lovTAP* --> TetR
4. TetR --> RFP
5. RFP --> RFP* (activated, fluorescent)
Where:
L is the concentration of lovTAP [um]
L* is the concentration of the activated lovTAP (all lovTAP molecules become activated when exposed to light stimulation) [um]
T is the concentration of TetR [um]
R is the concentration of RFP [um]
R* is the concentration of activated RFP [um]
is the function of light exposure
is the basal expression of the given promoter
K is the affinity of the given repressor for its target promoter [um]
n is the cooperativity coefficient of the Hill function
is the molecule degradation rate [min -1]
is the dilution rate [min -1]
Parameters values
The values used  for these parameters are listed  below:
L = 7 [um]
= 0.05 for TetR and 0.3 for RFP
K = 7 [um] for L*, 7 [um] for TetR and 7 [um] for RFP [um]
n = 2 for L, 2 for TetR and 2 for RFP
= 0.069  [min -1] for LovTAP, 0.069  [min -1] for TetR and 0.012 [min -1] for RFP
= log(2)/20, since a division occurs every 20 min for E. Coli
