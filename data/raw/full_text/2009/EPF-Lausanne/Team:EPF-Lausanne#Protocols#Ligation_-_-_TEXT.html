Ligation Protocol
Reaction mix
T4 ligase buffer
1 µl
T4 ligase
0.5 µl
6:1 molar ratio of insert to vector (~10 ng of vector).
Complete with dH2O up to 10 µl.
Molar ratio
Notes
In general, we can take 1 µl of vector for 3 µl of insert. But you can change the molar ratio in case the sizes of the insert and the vector are really different.
To control ligation specificity, you need to have a control with the vector only.
Incubation
1h at Room Temperature.
