PCR purification
PureLink™ PCR Purification Kit – Invitrogen
Binding DNA
1. Add 4 volumes of PureLink™ Binding Buffer with isopropanol (above) or Binding Buffer HC with isopropanol (above) to 1 volume of PCR (50-100 μl). Mix well.
2. Remove a PureLink™ Spin Column in a Collection Tube from the package.
3. Add sample with appropriate Binding Buffer from Step 1 to the PureLink™ Spin Column.
4. Centrifuge the column at room temperature at 10,000 × g for 1 minute.
5. Discard the flow through and place the spin column into the collection tube.
6. Proceed to Washing DNA, next protocol.
Washing DNA
1. Add 650 μl of Wash Buffer with ethanol to the column.
2. Centrifuge the column at room temperature at 10,000 × g for 1 minute. Discard the flow through from the collection tube and place the column into the tube.
3. Centrifuge the column at maximum speed at room temperature for 2–3 minutes to remove any residual Wash Buffer. Discard the collection tube.
4. Proceed to Eluting DNA, below.
Eluting DNA
1. Place the spin column in a clean 1.7-ml PureLink™ Elution Tube supplied with the kit.
2. Add 30 μl of Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) or sterile, distilled water (pH >7.0) to the center of the column. Here we purify the 2 tubes in one column.
3. Incubate the column at room temperature for 1 minute.
4. Centrifuge the column at maximum speed for 2 minutes.
5. The elution tube contains your purified PCR product. Remove and discard the column. The recovered elution volume is ~48 μl.
6. Store the purified PCR product at -20°C or use PCR product for the desired downstream application.
