Molecular dynamics theory
Molecular dynamics simulation consists of the numerical, step-by-step, solution of the classical equations of motion. For this purpose we need to be able to calculate the forces acting on the atoms, and these are usually derived from a potential energy. This potential energy can be divided into:
the non-bonded interactions:
The Lennard-Jones potential is the most commonly used form, with two parameters: σ, the diameter, and ε, the well depth. It takes into account the Van der Waals forces. It represents the non-bonded forces and the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms.

when electrostatic charges are present, we add the Coulomb force, where Q1, Q2 are the  charges and ϵ0 is the permittivity of free space
the bonded interactions:
Angles, bonds and dihedral angles have to be taken into account
