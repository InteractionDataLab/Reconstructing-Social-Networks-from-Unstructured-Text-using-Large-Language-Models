Modeling overview
Protein domain of interest
Our protein of interest is LOVTAP . This protein was sythetically engineered by Sosnick group. It is a fusion protein between a LOV domain (Avena Sativa phototropin 1) and the E. Coli tryptophan repressor. This protein undergoes changes under light activation as shown by Sosnick et al, in fact when the protein is activated by light it binds DNA and inversely. For more information about LOVTAP protein please click here .
Goal
Starting material
Both LOV domain crystallography files were obtained from RCSB :
Light activated LOV domain
Dark LOV domain
These crystallographies were done by Halavaty et al. .
Molecular dynamics: a little theory
Molecular dynamics simulation consists of the numerical, step-by-step, solution of the classical equations of motion. For this purpose we need to be able to calculate the forces acting on the atoms, and these are usually derived from a potential energy.

This potential energy can be divided into:
The non-bonded interactions:
The Lennard-Jones potential is the most commonly used form, with two parameters: σ, the diameter, and ε, the well depth. It takes into account the Van der Waals forces. It represents the non-bonded forces and the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms.

when electrostatic charges are present, we add the Coulomb force, where Q1, Q2 are the  charges and ϵ0 is the permittivity of free space
The bonded interactions:
Angles, bonds and dihedral angles have to be taken into account:

Results
To do
- Model allosteric interactions between LOVTAP & TrpR
What will be done:
- Model of LOVTAP in dark phase
- Model of LOVTAP in light phase
- Characterize how the J-alpha helix changes
- Model structural changes that enhance the switch feature of LOVTAP e.g. in dark phase: really weak interaction between LOVTAP and the corresponding DNA sequence, in light phase: strong binding of LOVTAP on DNA.
- Between Light state and Dark State
- RMS between light state and dark state
- length between the two arms N C
- only cytochrome with interactions in light state and dark state
To envisage
- Molecular mutational assay
