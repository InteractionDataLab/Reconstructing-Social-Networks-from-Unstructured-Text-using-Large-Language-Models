SBOL-V
Anusuya Ramasubramanian, Treasurer, Class of 2011, Biomechanical Engineering. Anusuya is interested in exploring the role of human-engineered nanomaterials in biological systems. For the past three years, she has been working in Jeffrey T. Glass' lab at Duke University's Pratt School on the selective wetting properties of carbon nanotubes.
As part of the Stanford iGEM Team, Anusuya helped design and test the SoxR- SoxS promtoer pathway, which was characterized on both high and low copy plasmids, and the 5 methyl tryptophan system, which is in the process of being characterized.  Anusuya also helped play a role in the creation of symbols for sBOLv, a new visual, open-source language for synthetic biology
