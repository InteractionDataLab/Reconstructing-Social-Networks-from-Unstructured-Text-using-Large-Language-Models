Welcome to the Stanford team Wiki for iGEM 2009
Stanford iGEM is a student-run, faculty-directed research group at Stanford University. The objective of our interdisciplinary group is to design and build novel engineered biological systems using standardized DNA-based parts to submit to the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition, held annually at MIT.
We will be competing for the first time in 2009.
Our research draws from the principles of Synthetic Biology, an emerging interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary area that involves the design and construction of biological systems.
BOO! Robert has 1 day left and wishes to make his mark on the wiki before he goes! Bwahaha go SiGEM!
Sad face :(   Crying..... Nooooo!
