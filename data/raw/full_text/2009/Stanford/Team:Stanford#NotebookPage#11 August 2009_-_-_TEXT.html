Daily Work
Goals
Revise diagram breakdowns for Jerome
Revise vBOL symbols
Either research Th-17 to NO pathway or work on wiki
Project / Accomplishments
Looks like transformations worked!!!! Yay! (1.1b and 2.1a)
Mini-preps of SoxR/S cultures and pcr on 1.1b and 2.1a
Need to sequence 1.2a
Made revised constructions for Device 1
New schematics for Diagrams
vBOL symbols revised
Problems
Simple schematic for Device 2....
Alternative Solutions
Events
Meeting w/ Jerome for the presentation
Show Naive CD4+ cells leading to T-cells?
Testing line w/ filtering T-cells
Numbers
Rough percentage of amounts of T-cells (normal, non-recognizing, self-recognizing...)
Why don't  some self-recognizing t-cells undergo apoptosis?
Circuit diagram
Make text bigger, animation,...
Take out IDO and dendritic cells?
Shorter descriptions
More visual support and animation
Specifically on slides describing why we need device 2
Device 2 parts breakdown- need separate promoter
Visual- pyramid w/ age group and
Immunology section- still too complicated
More pictures
Start w/ what the immune system "is" as a definition? Very general
Stay away from capital letters
Differentiate acquired and innate immune responses- mention vaccines!
Talk more about acquired w/ animation (fun can be good)
What is an antigen? What is an antibody?
Scheme is nice- could be more simple
Take away Tc cells
Selective filtering- make a factory line and assembly line
Define autoimmune diseases w/ respect to Self-recognizing t-cells
Start w/ epidemiology then immune response, then back to IBD w/ respect to the immune system
Mention system therapy vs. cure
Showing the cause of inflammation itself.... b-bells, t-cells, and plasma cells (igE?)-
Show transportation- lymph, vs blood, vs epithelial crossing
Where are Naïve CD4+ cells? Needs to be in the place of activity!!!
email Ariana or Professor Steinman
Meeting w/ Christine for Stanford News at 2pm
Interviews, vidoes, and revised article
Looks good!
FAB at 4:00
Trp looks better, but not perfect yet...
More modeling help needed?
IBD Overview
Be upfront of assumptions and parameters
We assume it is t-cell ratios for inflammation
Questions to answer
Where are Naive CD4+ cells?
What is the "cause" of IBD?
Why don't medicines target t-cells?
Also,
Future- how can we biosynthesize 5MT?
Comments
Questions to be answered….
Genetic component of the disease?
Mouse model of IBD to test linear relationship of Th-17 and Treg cells
Suicide device?
Do people take RA for treatment?
The acid form of Vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid or ATRA, has been made into Tretinoin, which
Do people take Il-6 for treatment?
Other uses?
Where are Naïve CD4+ cells? Needs to be in the place of activity!!!
vBOL, are there names for the individual pictures
