SBOL-V
Suzie Bartram, Class of 2012, Undeclared- Engineering. During the summer, Suzie helped design the SBOL-V visual graphics and language. After developing and testing several sets of symbols, she helped release the first compiled set, which can be seen under the team SBOL-V page. She additionally worked on building and characterizing the Anti-Inflammation Device. Her main focus delved into the SoxR- SoxS promtoer pathway; she worked on designing and performing the necessary assays to test this inducible, superoxide sensor. This included testing downstream GFP production when induced with paraquat, characterized on both a high and low copy plasmid.
Suzie's past research experiences include an internship at the McLaughlin Research Institute in the lab of John R. Bermingham, Jr., Ph.D. where she performed in situ hybridization on mouse embryos to study genes related to Schwann cell differentiation and peripheral myelination.
