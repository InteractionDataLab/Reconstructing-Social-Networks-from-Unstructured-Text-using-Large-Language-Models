Daily Work
Goals
Morning:
vBOL tutorial polishing
purchase omnigraffle
possible wiki template work
Afternoon
Red papers for NO/SoxR affinity and Th-17 to NO pathway
Project / Accomplishments
Long review of entire cloning process
Learned to check sequences w/ Ape and order form (fwd and rev)
Broke down project steps
Finished new draft of presentation and went over it w/Jerome
Now contact physician and clinician
Finished vBOL presentation
Grew liquid cultures of B0015 and B0034, and part 53 and glycerol stock 9
Started ligation for 1.1b (device one, first round of cloning, part b)
Right cycle on PCR?
Problems
A little unsure about ligation protocol.... which PCR cycle? We chose ligation...
Alternative Solutions
Events
3pm meeting w/ Jerome about updated presentation... Feedback
More clear about age groups- is this when it starts?
Why industrial countries targeted? Sterile environments....
Where does it take place?
Genetic component of the disease?
Mouse model of IBD to test linear relationship of Th-17 and Treg cells
Colon slide- show parts w/ larger picture and then transition into video by itself
Naive cd4+ cells do not show up in the video on the screen
Positive feedback between t-cells and differentiation of naive cd4+ cells
Trp analog levels
Device one diagram: sensor will end at SoxS,  then generator is entire sequence
Constitutive export system..
Constitutively expressing everything besides il-6
Missing consistent background of T-cells... larger description of immunology and mediated immune cells
Simple, fun animation... like the french cartoons
Take out th1 and th2 cells in picture
th-17 to t-reg cells stemming from Immune System
Go straight to the problem
Explain T-cells- what do they do? Like a detector....
Signal another cell to kill the pathogen...
talk about the recruitment of b-cells
Cartoon is not a system level diagram
New system level diagram- simple but w/ external features like b-cells and dendritic cells
Also, upstream of inflammation and immunosuppression symbols in diagram... disease...
Reuse presentation diagrams
Missing level between box pictures and basic parts diagram
Maybe boxes such as SoxR/S system= NO sensor
Introduce vBOL later, but not too much time
suicide device?
schematics w. numbers/letters
Other questions... do people take RA for treatment? Il-6? Methyl tryptophans for IDO
Check out other uses for the products
