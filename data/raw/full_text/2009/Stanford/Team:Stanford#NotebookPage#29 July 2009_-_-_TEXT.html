Meeting with Cesar 4pm Y2E2 about vBOL (Suzie)
To do:
Finish Mac Pwpt Tutorial
Need uploaded jPEG images
Create finalized graffle images of inducible promoters w/oval on the line
Work around different export formats....eps and photoshop and potential colors?
Decisions Made:
Standard Image will be the oval on the arrow line
Boxes will be optional- seem to have more use for "zoom-in" diagrams
Images will be colorless, but we will provide a recommendation key
Red = Terminator
Green = Promoter
others?
Variable images... aka "open reading frames" no recommendations- adapted for individual needs
