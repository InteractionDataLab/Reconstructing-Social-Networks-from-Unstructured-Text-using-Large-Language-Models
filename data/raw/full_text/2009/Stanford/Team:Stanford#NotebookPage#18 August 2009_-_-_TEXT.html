Events
9am meeting w/ Grad Student
Anusuya w/ IBD and Immune System
Not so much Immunology....
Emphasize work w/ Il-10 treatment= PRECEDENT
Need slide w/ differentiation
Too many slides
Symptoms- mention somewhere else but don't necessarily need its own slide
Is video necessary?
Emphasize why our therapy is BETTER
Awesomeness on 1 slide - update advantages slide to compare to current therapy
Table? Larger font?
Answer question more clearly about why we need device 2
Suzie's Slides w/ Constructions
Slide 1 - colored lines and provide key
Slide 2 - mention vBOL
Slide 3 - ask about sequences leading to protein- is it correct? Add arrows
Graph Larger
Slide 4- Easiest to understand and just label important parts..weak constitutive beta carotene?? OR not?
Slide 5 - metadata?
Slie 6- rest.... revise for device 2... const export system?
Mark and lab update...
Cultures of parts... mini-prep and pcr w/ new primers...
5:30 meeting w/ Clinician
Update From Meeting with IBD Specialist Dr. Shamita Shah
Good News
Fully supportive of the concept
Understands importance of and our reasoning behind both devices
Supports probiotic research
Enthusiastic for future implications of this device as a “treatment/diagnostic tool”
Willing to share her own slides on IBD and give 20 presentation on her current knowledge
She has great statistics and can help us frame our device to tailor to a specific target audience
Next Steps
Decide what “phase” of IBD we want to target
Early diagnostic… difficult to distinguish between UC and Crohn’s, but certainly useful
Complementary treatment: use as another “tool” for clinicians
Post-treatment diagnostic to prevent recurrence…
Dr. Shah sees this as the most promising and necessary right now w/ regards to treatment
No previous probiotic research in this field
Many cases lead to recurrence- and patients need annual colonic scopes
Meet w/ Dr. Shah again early September
Challenges
We need numbers…
The “ratio” needs to be known or better understood and Dr. Shah doesn’t collect these numbers
When/how will the device be “triggered” with regards to these numbers?
Switch bacterial strain to be more sustainable in the small intestine?
