Summary
File:Device 2 Overview.JPG
The anti-immunosuppressive device consists of two components: a sensor and a responder.  The sensor will detect local concentrations of a marker indicative of Treg-driven immunosuppression.  When the levels of this input signal reach above a certain baseline threshold, the sensor will induce activity from the responder.  The resulting output signal will modify the local cytokine milieu to support differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and repress the immunosuppressive Treg lineage.

Comments
Rather than looking at metabolic changes due to Th17 cells, maybe we should look at precursor changes that result in Th17 differentiation. Think of it as a feed forward mechanism. I am thinking in particular things that are affected by Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR ) and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (RORy) .
Check out this paper on Th17 And Treg control. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/abs/nature06880.html
Other Considerations
To what extent will 5-methyltryptophan inhibit growth of our machine?  5-methyltryptophan has been identified as an antimetabolite that induces false feedback inhibition of the trp biosynthetic pathway.
Other potential "input" signals: IL-10, TGF-beta, byproducts of HO-1 Other potential "output" signals: IL-17, IL-1-beta, CpG DNA, TLR stimuli
