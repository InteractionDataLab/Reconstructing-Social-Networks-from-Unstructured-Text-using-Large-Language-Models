The Stanford iGEM team consist of 10 undergraduate students, and also include graduate student mentors and faculty advisors.  Students are working full time throughout the summer of 2009 to engineer a synthetic biological system, and will present their project in the form of posters and a 20 minute presentation at the Jamboree. This is the first time that our team is competing.
