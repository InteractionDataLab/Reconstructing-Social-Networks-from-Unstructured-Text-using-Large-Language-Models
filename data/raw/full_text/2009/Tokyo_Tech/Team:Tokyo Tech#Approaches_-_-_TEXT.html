Approaches
As concrete approaches to realize the long-term plan of terra forming, we have five conceivable key components which would play an important role to adapt to and modify Martian environment. Those are 1)Iron-Oxidizing Baceria, 2) Microbial Consortium, 3) Anti-Freezing Protein (AFP), 4) Blackened Bacteria and 5) N2-Generating Bacteria.  This year, we Tokyo Tech team focus on all of those components except N2-generating bacteria.
