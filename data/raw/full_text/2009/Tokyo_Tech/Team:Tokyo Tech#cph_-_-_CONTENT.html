</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Introduction_.7EWhy_do_we_need_photo_sensor.7E">Introduction ~Why do we need photo sensor~</SPAN></H2><P>Mars also has day and night like Earth. The strength of the sunlight reaching Mars varies from day to night. During the day, the Mars’ surface temperature is about at most -20 degrees Celsius and in the night it drops to -100 degrees Celsius, so it natural that E. coli should behave differently in the day and night. Photo-sensor can be one powerful tool to control or regulate gene expression that is suitable for the temperature. For example, we introduced anti-freeze protein into E. coli, and it should express an appropriate amount of the protein based on the surface temperature, which is in proportion to the strength of light. We believe that this sensor can also be applied and utilized for terra-forming in some other way.

Cph8 consists of cph1 and envZ. Cph1 is an extracellular sensor and cph1 bound to PCB (converted from heam by ho1 and pcyA) responds to the light. EnvZ is an intracellular response regulator and has a histidine kinase domain that phosphorylates ompR protein so that it can regulate gene expression. When cph8 is not exposed to the light, the histidine kinase domain phosphorylates ompR, and then ompR-phosphate activates the PompC by binding to it. When cph8 is exposed to the light, the histidine kinase can’t phosphorylate ompR so PompC is inactive.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Experimental_overview">Experimental overview</SPAN></H3><P>We attempted to construct Biobrick coding cph8 and PCB-related enzymes, assay them, and characterize them. We used the strain, Ru1012 [MC4100 ara+ φ(OmpC-lacZ) 10-25 ΔenvZ::KanR], which chromosomally codes a ompC promoter fused to a lacZ reporter. That strain enables us to assay the activity of cph8 and PCB-related enzymes easily. Origin and resistance on the backbone is the most significant matter we have to consider, because we planned to transform Ru1012, putting two plasmids into it and the origins and resistances of the two plasmids should be different. Because Ru1012 codes KanR, we have to prepare two kinds of backbones. One codes AmpR, and the other codes Cm respectively.

So we decided to put both plasmids into pSB6A and assay them respectively using the two given plasmids. One codes cph8 with ColE1 origin and CmR. The other codes PCB-related with p15A origin and AmpR. Also we used these plasmids, pBR322 with colE1 origin and AmpR and pACYA184 with p15A origin and CmR. We conducted assay in the following plasmids combination.
