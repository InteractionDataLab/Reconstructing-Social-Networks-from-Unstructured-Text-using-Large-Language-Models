This idea was inspired by the theory of  Prisoner’s Dilemma.       As in prisoners’ dilemma, the bacteria in  our design are faced with two solutions for coexistence, they could either  choose to cooperate with each other by providing inducers to express their  partners’ antibiotics-resistance genes or they could take a foe strategy in  which no cooperation is needed for both strains’ survival.
