The vision of the institute is to achieve excellence at the global level in research and manpower development in Bioinformatics and Biotechnology. The Institute will stand for integration of basic research with industrial applications in greater interest of national achievements in this decade of Modern Biology. It is also visualized that the cutting edge technology development and imparting of high quality education vis-à-vis handholding industries will be the main features of the Institute.
Biotechnology and Bioinformatics are highly multidisciplinary sciences. The in-house faculty at IBB includes highly qualified teachers with expertise in various areas such as biological sciences, chemical sciences, computational physics, bioinformatics etc. A large number of qualified teachers and scientists from several other institutes are also invited to contribute to the teaching program.
The main focus areas that have been identified for research are diabetes, malaria, liver cancer, viral diseases and herbal drug development. Research projects in other areas such as bio-nanomaterials, biomaterials, environmental microbiology, marine biotechnology and structural bioinformatics have been initialized in collaboration with various groups at different departments on the campus. These projects are funded by various national funding agencies such as DBT, DST, CSIR, UGC, ICMR and ISRO. The faculty members at IBB are actively involved in getting independent research grants and in undertaking collaborative projects.
