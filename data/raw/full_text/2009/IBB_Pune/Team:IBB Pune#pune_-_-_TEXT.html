Pune has a glorious history of nearly 1600 years. The Pataleshwar caves (Near JM Road) from the 5th century provide evidence for Pune’s old settlements. The Rashtrakut Kings had built a beautiful temple of Shiva called Punyeshwar, which was unfortunately destroyed during the Sultan’s attack on city in 13th century.
The earliest evidences that can be found are that of copper plates belonging to 758 A. D. - 768 A. D. The city's historical associations are fast woven with Shivaji Maharaj, the Peshwas and Lokmanya Tilak. When Bajirao-I became the Peshwa, he made Pune the headquarters of the army and the Shaniwar Wada was built. In 1820 the Peshwas were dethroned and the British established a permanent Army Cantonment. Since then it has moved gracefully from the past into the present.
Peace and Prosperity are two words synonymous with Pune city, which is internationally acclaimed for its educational traditions and communal harmony. Students come here not only from all over India but from all over the world. Apart from students, a large number of foreigners are drawn to the BKS Iyengar Yoga Institute, and the Osho Center. Pune is, in fact a potpourri of the old and the new. What makes it tick is a harmonious blend between the two. This growing metropolis brings to the mind a myriad of images - ancient forts, ornate palaces, shopping arcades, educational institutions, Temples, mosques, and churches and rolling hills. The Ganapati festival celebrated yearly, called the Pune Festival, has made its mark on the tourist map of India.
The Socio-economic profile of Pune is also being transformed with its fast-growing urban area and growth in industry and technology. It has also become the nerve center for Information technology, Biotechnology, Automobiles and Real estate among other things.
Pune is definitely marching towards achieving international stature and repute, and developing into a globally recognized, vibrant and dynamic education and industry based economy.
