Characterization of And Gates:
Even as the wiki freezes we are characterizing Const.Prom-LacO-mRFP for its expression. We hope we get positive results.
We carried out the following transformations successfully:
Native Biobricks
pLL promoter               - BBa_I746365
GFP coding sequence        - BBa_E0040
RFP coding sequence
GFP Translational unit
RFP Translational unit
Enhanced CFP
Fast GFP
Constitutive promoter      -BBa_J23102
Promoter + RBS
T7 promoter
pLuxR
Double terminator
RBS
Constitutive LuxI
LuxR Translational unit
