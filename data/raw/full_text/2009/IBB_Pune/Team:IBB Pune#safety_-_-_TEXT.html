Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No, our project does not raise any such safety issues. While formulating our project idea and the relevant experimental designs, we took special care that no safety problems would arise, public or environmental. We followed the GLPs established in our labs to ensure researcher safety. We were supervised in our observance of these GLPs by our instructors.
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
No. To overcome this glitch while handling sensitive material like BioBricks, we made sure an experienced Instructor was involved and took stringent measures so that no mistakes were made.
The reason for this lack of awareness in our University is due to the lack of ongoing Synthetic Biology research here. We have taken the initiative and talked to the relevant authorities including the Vice Chancellor, to set into motion the machinery to ensure such biosafety measures are put into place.
What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
-
Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No. We have a project plan that ensures no breach of biosafety.
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
