Hi everyone!!!
We are team iBB from the University of Pune. Our institute is a center for excellence in research in biotechnology.
Our iGEM Team consists of 7 undergrads and 2 advisors.

The IBB iGEM story
It all began in July 2008 when Samit read about iGEM and the whole idea fascinated him...it remained a topic of hot discussions and really intense brainstorming in IBB for months together until it slowly waned away due to the exams and normal curriculum.....people forgot what iGEM was until the day a mail was received by Mandar about the registration, and as always the IBB trio; Mandar, Swetha and Samit started the registration process at the eleventh hour....The task was tedious and tiring and there was a lot of red tapism they had to go through... finally the hard work paid off... And IBB got into iGEM.....
Wish us luck!
