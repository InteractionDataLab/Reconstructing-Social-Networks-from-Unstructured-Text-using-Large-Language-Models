Safety Concerns
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
public safety, or
environmental safety?
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry?
1. Researcher safety
All our researchers took (and passed) safety training for biological safety and chemical safety to meet the standards set by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. All our lab work was carried out in a Bio Safety level 2 laboratory. Safety protocols listed on the websites (see links below) were followed during experimental work.
Biological safety: http://www2.fpm.wisc.edu/biosafety/index.htm
Chemical safety: http://www2.fpm.wisc.edu/chemsafety/training.htm
Environmental and public safety concerns were not an issue with our project.
2. The links for the authority on Biological and Chemical safety at UW Madison are posted below.
Biological safety: http://www2.fpm.wisc.edu/biosafety/index.htm
Chemical safety: http://www2.fpm.wisc.edu/chemsafety/training.htm
3. Apart from the initial training of team members, the safety organizations were not involved with our project since we did not run into any safety issues.
4. None of the BioBricks we synthesized raise any safety concerns.
