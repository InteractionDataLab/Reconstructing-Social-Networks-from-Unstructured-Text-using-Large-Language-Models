ENGINEERING HALL
This is where we work!
Engineering Hall is commonly referred to as EHall on campus. It is host to a wide array of engineering classes and labs. The mall in front of the building is popular hang out area for engineering students and is a nice place to eat lunch in the summer. Starting this year, our team is working in the new Wisconsin iGEM Lab! Now all Wisconsin iGEM Teams will have their own lab on campus.
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN - MADISON
The UW-Madison campus is settled in the downtown area of Madison, Wisconsin and wedged between the two glacial lakes Mendota and Monona. Madison is the flagship school of the Wisconsin State University System and currently enrolls 42,000 students. The school is one of the US’s largest scientific research schools and is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Learn more about our university at our Wikipedia Page .
Our school is privileged to have James Thomson on campus as a professor and researcher. In 1998,  Thomson was the first to isolate and culture human embryonic stem cells and has been on the forefront of development in the field ever since. To learn more about his work, visit his Lab’s Website .
Have you ever read The Onion?  The Onion was founded by Tim Keck and Christopher Johnson, two UW-Madison students, in 1988. Watch and read funny and satirical(fake) news on their Official website .
UW Madison has been known for Student Activism. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW-Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film The War at Home. To this day UW-Madison students are very politically oriented and have given our school a reputation of activism.
Environmentalism would have never been the same without UW-Madison. John Muir took his first botany lesson at UW-Madison. His writings and philosophy strongly influenced the formation of the modern environmental movement, which UW-Madison strongly supports. Learn more about our Environmental Initiatives .
