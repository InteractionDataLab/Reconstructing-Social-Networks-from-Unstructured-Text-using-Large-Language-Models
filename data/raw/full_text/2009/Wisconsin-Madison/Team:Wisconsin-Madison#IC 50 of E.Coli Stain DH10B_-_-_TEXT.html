IC50 Model of DH10B
This plot shows the growth of DH10B in various concentrations of NaCl supplemented LB.
For uninhibited growth, the linear region of a log transformation will indicate growth.  When the linear regions of the natural log conversions are plotted against salt concentration, and the half max growth is found at .54M.  This is the IC 50 for NaCl on growth.
