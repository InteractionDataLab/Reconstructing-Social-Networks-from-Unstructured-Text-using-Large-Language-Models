Team:Wisconsin-Madison/Preparation of Competent Cells
From 2009.igem.org
Transformation of Plasmids into Competent Cells
The process consists of growing cells to mid-log stage, harvesting, and performing multiple washes with sterile 10% glycerol to remove salts which interfere with electroporation.
General Considerations:
Keep everything cold, on ice
Glycerol pellets are not firm; try to remove as much supernate as possible, but be careful not to lose the pellet
All containers that come in contact with cells should be sterile
Keep centrifuge bottles dedicated for making Electrocompetent cells
Have 1 liter of 10% sterile glycerol chilled on ice, to less than 4C... or in a cold box overnight.
Keep manipulation of cells to a minimum, be gentle.
Resuspend pelleted cells using a sterile plastic pipette. Work quickly.
Harvest cells at 0.6 – 0.75 O.D. (A600nm)
A) Fermentation (Inoculum)
Streak for single colony from -70C glycerol stock
Start 50 ml, No Salt LB inoculum, 37C, overnight
Fermentation
Use 25 ml of the above Inoculum per liter of No Salt LB media (prewarm media to 37C)
Grow at 37C, shake at approximately 200 rpm
Grow to 0.6 – 0.75 O.D. (A600nm)......transfer to ice immediately to chill
B)    Processing
1) Spin the chilled culture at 8,000 rpm, 10 minutes, 2 degrees C (use four 250 ml centrifuge bottles). Remove the supernate carefully. Save the pellets.
2) Resuspend all four pellets in a total volume of 200 ml cold 10% glycerol. Combine all resuspended pellets in one 250 ml centrifuge bottle.
3) Spin at 8,000 rpm, 10 minutes. Remove the supernate carefully.
4) Resuspend pellet in 150 ml cold 10% glycerol.
5) Spin at 8,000 rpm, 10 minutes. Remove the supernate carefully.
6) Resuspend pellet in 100 ml cold 10% glycerol.
7) Spin at 8,000 rpm, 10 minutes. Remove the supernate carefully.
8) To the pellet, add 2 ml 10% glycerol. Resuspend carefully with a 1 ml Pipetteman.
9) Transfer 110 ul of resuspended cells into cold***(-70C) 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.
10) Transfer immediately to a -70C freezer (Do not use liquid nitrogen).
11) Freeze overnight before using cells.
The microcentrifuge tubes should be in a plastic tray, having been stored overnight at -70C freezer. Remove the tray and tubes from the -70C freezer immediately prior to aliquoting cells into the microcentrifuge tubes.
