1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
One element of our project that might raise safety issues is that the extraction of PCB from Spirulina algae requires the use of mercuric chloride. This is both a hazard to researcher safety and environmental safety, as mercuric chloride is highly toxic and fairly corrosive. Its use requires both use of a fume-hood and double gloving, and special disposal. Avoidance of use of mercuric chloride was one of the main reasons we elected to pursue PCB biosynthesis as an element of our project. Having yeast synthesize the PCB themselves would obviate the need to do an extraction, and therefore free us from having to use mercuric chloride.
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes there is.
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project?
Provided proper use and disposal of the mercuric chloride, they sanctioned its use for laboratory purposes.
4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, none of the parts we made this year raise any safety issues.
