Discussions
The following discussions will be our primary form of communication before getting together for the summer.  However, we will continue to use this page (and the sub-pages) to permanently record our thoughts and ideas.  Please sign your comments by inserting "~~~~" after each so that we can keep track of who is communicating and when the information was posted.
