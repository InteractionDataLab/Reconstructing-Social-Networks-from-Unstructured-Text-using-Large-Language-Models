To prepare our biobricks to be sent to the registry the plasmid pSB1A2 from the iGEM collection kit was digesting with XbaI and SpeI. This linearized vector was used as backbone for insertions of all of our 4 biobricks amplified by PCR and inserted. (see <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:DTU_Denmark/parts">&quot;parts submitted&quot; </A> and a more through description of the experimental procedure to obtain these at <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:DTU_Denmark/notebookbiobrick">the notebook </A>).

Then the double stranded oligo was digested with XbaI and SpeI o/n (over night). In the morning the oligo was warmed up to 95 °C again and cooled down as former described. This method was chosen to denature the restriction enzyme before ligation as the oligoes would have been lost in a standard DNA purification. 
The oligo was inserted into two different plasmids:</P><P align="justify">1. <A href="https://www.lablife.org/ct?f=c&amp;a=showvecinfo&amp;vectorid=3289">pRS416 </A>: in-house yeast plasmid with URA marker that we wished to use to demonstrate that Biobrick <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K194002">BBa_K194002</A>  worked in yeast.
2. <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:pSB1A2">pSB1A2</A>: a iGEM plasmid what would be used to send the biobrick to MIT as we cannot send pRS416 with the biobrick due to intellectual property issues.</P><P align="justify">The two plasmids were digested seperately using two enzymes, XbaI (20U) and SpeI (10U). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for eight hours after which more enzyme was added to ensure maximum digestion. After an additional two hours of incubation the digested plasmids were dephosphorilised to prevent reanealing during ligation. This was achieved by an <A href="http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productM0289.asp">Antartic Phosphatase treatment</A> (25 U). The DNA was <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:DTU_Denmark/protocols#_Toc243890370"> gel-purified</A> and the resulting concentration was determined using fluorometrics (<A href="http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Product-Brand/Qubit.html">The Qubit Quantitation PlatformTM</A> from invitrogen). <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:DTU_Denmark/protocols#_Toc243890368">The ligation</A> was performed using T4-DNA ligase using a 3:1 ratio of fragment to vector and 9 ng DNA in total at a volume of 20 µl according to the manufactors recommendations. The actual ligation was carried out on a PCR machine for 1½ hours shifting the temperature from 10 °C to 30 °C at 30 second intervals as desribed by [1].

Yeast was also transformed with pSC011 kindly provided by Simon Carlsen, CMB containing the sequence from BBa_K194001 under the constitutive expression of the TEF promoter. pSC011 holds the same promoter and terminator as the pRS416 holding the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K194003"> BBa_K194003</A> and can therefore be used to analyze the difference of the addition of the Cln2 degradation signal.

The BioLector is able to keep the microtiterplate stirring and measures OD and GFP levels every 3rd minut making it ideal for our experimentt.

We characterized:
1. Wildtype as background: CEN PK 113 7D without any auxotrophic marker was chosen. If there is GFP fluorescence of the wildtype this needs to be accounted for.
2. Our <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:DTU_Denmark/genetic_design"> Redoxilater construct</A>: This construct holds the redoxilator sensor controlling the expression of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K194002"> BBa_K194002</A>. This plasmid was transformed into CEN PK 113 5D (Ura-).
3. Leaky construct: To check whether the redoxilator actually induces expression of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K194002"> BBa_K194002</A> or our minimal promoter is simply leaky. This plasmid was transformed into CEN PK 113 5D (Ura-).

The cells were grown in this media overnight to reach an OD high enough for inoculation of the microtiter plate for the BioLector. 
The cells were inoculated in the mirotiterplate in 1 ml media with an OD of 0.15 with the following carbon sources
1.glucose (20 g/l)
2.ethanol (15,7 g/l  = same cmol as glucose)

 As one can see, there is a significant difference between this two constructs in terms of GFP signal. As expected, the signal from the degradable GFP is much lower than the signal showed by the non-degradable GFP, as the GFP that is not being degraded is accumulating and giving a stronger signal.This results go in line with the results published by Avery and Mateus [3] that state that the degradable GFP has a 14 times shorter half-life than the non-degradable. Therefore, based on this results we demontrate that the biobrick BBa_K194002 submited, presents a good option as a fast degradable GFP for yeast. We show that both biobricks codes for Green Fluorescent Protein and that the addition of the sequence from Cln2 results in a strain with lower levels of GFP when the genes are expressed from the same promoter in plasmids with same copy number in the same strain <FONT size="3"><B>References</B></FONT></P><P align="justify">  [1] Lund, A.
