The iGEM 2009 team
Team organisation
The DTU iGEM '09 team was formed on the initiative of assistant professor, Kiran Raosaheb Patil. The six of us quickly came together, and with inspiration from our four advisors, a project was formulated. The organisation of the team is based on the bottom-up approach, and from day one we have been very self-suffient, spearheading fundraising, laboratory work, and all other practical details ourselves.
Meet the team!
