Genetic design
We have designed and physically constructed a genetic system that couples the intracellular NAD+/NADH level to the gene expression of a reporter protein. The system has potentially many applications including in vivo online monitoring of the redox poise, production optimization and cancer research with yeast as a model organism (see Applications).
The NAD+/NADH ratio is sensed by a system originating in Streptomyces coellicolor. In S. coellicolor the protein REX is a repressor and controls the gene expression of multiple genes by recognizing and binding to a specific DNA-sequence termed ROP (Rex operator). NAD+ and NADH compete to associate with Rex, but only a REX:NAD+ association can bind the ROP DNA-sequence (Brekasis and Paget, 2003).
In S. coellicolor REX DNA binding represses expression of target genes, by physically hindering RNA-polymerases from binding the promoter. As the transcription machinery of eukaryotes is different and more complicated, there are no guarantee that repression will be effective in eukaryotes. REX has therefore been fused to an eukaryotic transcriptional activator, a widely used technique applied for the investigation of the GAL proteins and other systems (Sadowski et al. 1988). The REX-activator fusion-protein is able to bind the ROB sequence placed upstream of a minimal eukaryotic promoter that only supports transcription upon activation. A certain NAD+/NADH ratio will activate the Redoxilator to recognize the ROB promoter, resulting in transcription of the reporter gene.

Gene design and redox regulation
A: The Rex gene has been fused to an activator domain and is transcribed constitutively, leading to constant concentration of the Rex-activator protein in the cell. The ROB sequence and a minimal promoter is followed by a reporter gene, which is only transcribed when the REX-activator fusion protein is bound to the promoter. B: The REX-activator only binds the ROB DNA sequence under the condition of having NAD+ bound. Under these circumstances the fused activator domain summons the RNA polymerase and the reporter gene is transcribed.
Design specifications
The genetic system consists of two synthetic genes: one coding for the REX-activator fusion protein, and one coding for a yeast optimized GFP gene under control of ROB fused to a minimal promoter. With this system GFP is only expressed when REX-Activator is bound to ROB, which occurs at high NAD+/NADH levels.
Simplified schematic representation of the synthetic genetic system on the DNA-level. The individual parts are described below.
The genetic elements and the requirements they need to fulfill are listed in the following table. The detailed description of the used genetic elements will not be made publicly available due to IP rights. The elements have been selected solely on their properties, and are from a variety of organisms - several of them are biobricks. All elements are codon optimized for S. cerevisiae

Synthetic Biology
“Synthetic Biology is an art of engineering new biological systems that don’t exist in nature.”
-Paras Chopra & Akhil Kamma
In nature, biological molecules work together in complex systems to serve purposes of the cell. In synthetic biology these molecules are used as individual functional units that are combined to form tailored systems exhibiting complex dynamical behaviour. From ‘design specifications’ generated from computational modelling, engineering-based approaches enables the construction of such new specified gene-regulatory networks. The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to construct systems that gain new functions, and the perspectives of the technology are enormous. It has already been used in several medical projects2 and is predicted to play a major role in biotech-production and environmental aspects.
