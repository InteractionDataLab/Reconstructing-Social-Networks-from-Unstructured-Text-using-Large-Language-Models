Team:DTU Denmark/test table
From 2009.igem.org
Genetic element
Required function
Constitutive promoter
Constitutive expression of   REX-Activator fusion protein
Kozak sequence
Ribosome start-codon   recognition and enhanced initiating of translation
REX
REX (redox regulator) that binds to   ROP at high NAD+/NADH ratio
Linker
To couple two protein   domains without disrupting their individual functions
Activator domain
Protein domain able to   activate transcription in eukaryotes in proximity of a minimal promoter.
Nuclear Localization   Sequence (NLS)
Translocation of the   REX-Activator protein to the nucleus
Terminator 1
Sequence that will terminate   transcription
 
 
ROB
DNA sequence that REX binds   at high NAD+/NADH ratio
Minimal promoter
Promoter devoid of   regulatory motifs. Only expression if an activator is bound upstream.
GFP
The amount of green   fluprescent protein can be quantitatively measured.
Degradation signal
Ensures fast degradation of   GFP
Terminator 2
Terminates transcription.   Different from terminator 1 to avoid direct repeats, which can cause problems   with PCR-amplifications
