DTU DENMARK
Welcome to the DTU-DENMARK iGEM team wiki. Here we present everything about our project, the team, how we have contributed to improve the registry of standard biological parts, and much more.
The Project
In this project we have
Designed and constructed a redox sensing device: The Redoxilator
Performed extensive mathematical modelling on the operation of the Redoxilator device
Written and submitted a novel biobrick assembly standard based on USER fusion that allows the assembly of several biobricks at once
Made a program for the design of primers needed for USER fusion online: PHUSER
Furthermore we have constructed and submitted four very useful biobricks to the registry.
The Team
Our team consists of six students in biotechnology and systems biology engineering, and we are the first team from the Technical University of Denmark. Please check out our team page to read more about us and our advisors.
The project has been done by a synthetic biology approach, and genetic components from diverse organisms have been assembled to build a genetic device. Synthetic biology is an increasingly significant area of research that can broadly be defined as an engineering approach to biology, with the goal of designing and implementing new cellular behaviors.
Achievements
Redox sensing device
Two novel genes have been designed and synthesized each comprised of 5 genetic elements. Together they function as a device termed the Redoxilator that can sense the internal redox state of a yeast cell, and output a reporter signal. Extensive mathematical modelling was performed to simulate how the construct would operate in vivo.
Biobricks
DNA of several new biobricks have been designed and submitted including a yeast optimized GFP reporter protein, a protein degradation sequence and a fast degradable yeast GFP. (Bronze medal)
We have demonstrated that our USER fusion biobrick works as expected and documented it (silver medal)
USER fusion Assembly standard
A new biobrick assembly standard that allows the rapid construction of multi-part devices have been developed and documented. The assembly standard offers many benefits: All restriction sites are allowed, multiple biobricks can be joined in one step, the result is scar-free making it ideal for protein fusions and more. (Gold medal)
USER-fusion primer design software
A novel and very useful software tool have been developed that can automatically design the optimal primers for USER fusion assembly of 2-9 biobricks, taking several parameters into account.
