From 2009.igem.org
This is a template page. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples HERE .
You MUST have a team description page, a project abstract, a complete project description, and a lab notebook.  PLEASE keep all of your pages within your teams namespace.
You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this is the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)

What we did
The aim of this project is to model and construct a molecular NAD+/NADH ratio sensing system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using a synthetic biology approach. The sensor will work as an inducible transcription factor, being active only at certain levels of the NAD+/NADH ratios. By coupling the sensor to the expression of a reporter gene, the system can be used for monitoring the NAD+/NADH redox poise in vivo. This will be beneficial for research in many areas including productivity optimization and cancer research. Furthermore, the sensor will be coupled to the biosynthesis of a gene-product (e.g. insulin), in an attempt to improve and prolong chemostat fermentation processes by producing in small bursts, thereby limiting cell stress.
Where we're from
We are a team of engineering student from the Technical University of Denmark, located in Lyngby north of the nations capitol, Copenhagen.
