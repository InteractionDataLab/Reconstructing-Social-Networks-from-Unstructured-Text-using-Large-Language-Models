Activities relating to the redoxilator
For more detailed information see results .
Thursday 15/10/2009
BioLector experiment initiated! Lets get some results!
Wednesday 14/10/2009
To have inoculum for the BioLector experiment, colonies were picked from our plates and grown till tomorrow.
Monday 5/10/2009
The yeasts were streak diluted onto a new plate to be sure that we have a single transformant.
Thursday 1/10/2009
Our redoxilator construct and leaky construct were ready for yeast transformation into CEN PK 113 5D (Ura-) using the URA marker present these plasmids.
Wednesday 30/9/2009
The resulting vectors were purification. The presence of our leaky redoxilator construct was verified by digestion with XmaI.
Tuesday 29/9/2009
Liquid over night colonies were prepared. Cultures were randomly picked using a sterile pipette tip from the transformation plate and incubated into liquid media containing kanamycin.
Monday 28/9/2009
To test how leaky our redoxilator construct was, the redoxilator part was removed by NotI digested followed by gel-purification. The backbone missing the redox sensor/activator was ligated and transformed into E. coli.
Friday 25/9/2009
Colonies seen!
Thursday 24/9/2009
Our dear redoxilator construct arrieved from California (DNA 2.0) The DNA was extracted from filter paper using MilliQ water and transformed into E. Coli.
June 2009
The genetic design is now ready, and it should work according to the newly finished model.
Since January 2009...
Figuring out the project idea took a while and meetings among the team members started early this year.
Work process
Our team works parallel in smaller sub-teams. Some of us work hard in the lab, while others are in the process of developing software and the in silico model of the Redoxilator system. However, we constantly keep each other updated, and meet often to exchange ideas and take turns at the different tasks, thus exhausting all of our combined knowledge in every aspect of this project.
