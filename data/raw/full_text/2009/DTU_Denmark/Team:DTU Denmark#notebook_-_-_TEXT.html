Work process
Our team works parallel in smaller sub-teams. Some of us work hard in the lab, while others are in the process of developing software and the in silico model of the Redoxilator system. However, we constantly keep each other updated, and meet often to exchange ideas and take turns at the different tasks, thus exhausting all of our combined knowledge in every aspect of this project.
