Acknowledgements
A very special thanks goes out to assistant professor Kiran Raosaheb Patil for getting the group together and for his expert guidance and advise.
Also a special thanks to PhD student Simon Carlsen for invaluable experimental advice and practical help, and to Post. Doc Bjarne Gram Hansen for sharing his expertise on USER fusion, and for his help constructing our redoxilator construct. We also owe thanks to Post. Doc. Line Albertsen for helping with the redoxilator construct, and for her input for design of protein fusions using linkers.
Many thanks to associate professor Chris Workman and PhD student Emmanouil Papadakis for taking time out of their busy schedules to help us with GFP measurements.
Last but not least, thanks to master's student Marc Juul Christoffersen for helping with the web interface and server uplink of the USER fusion primer design program - Watch out for this guy at next years iGEM comp!
Achievements
Redox sensing device
Two novel genes have been designed and synthesized each comprised of 5 genetic elements. Together they function as a device termed the Redoxilator that can sense the internal redox state of a yeast cell, and output a reporter signal. Extensive mathematical modelling was performed to simulate how the construct would operate in vivo.
Biobricks
DNA of several new biobricks have been designed and submitted including a yeast optimized GFP reporter protein, a protein degradation sequence and a fast degradable yeast GFP. (Bronze medal)
We have demonstrated that our USER fusion biobrick works as expected and documented it (silver medal)
USER fusion Assembly standard
A new biobrick assembly standard that allows the rapid construction of multi-part devices have been developed and documented. The assembly standard offers many benefits: All restriction sites are allowed, multiple biobricks can be joined in one step, the result is scar-free making it ideal for protein fusions and more. (Gold medal)
USER-fusion primer design software
A novel and very useful software tool have been developed that can automatically design the optimal primers for USER fusion assembly of 2-9 biobricks, taking several parameters into account.
