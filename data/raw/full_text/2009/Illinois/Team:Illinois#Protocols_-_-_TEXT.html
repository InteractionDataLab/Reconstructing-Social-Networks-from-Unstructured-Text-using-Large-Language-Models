Protocols
This page describes protocols or includes links to protocols used in our project.  Recipes used are also listed in a separate section.  Protocols are organized by category.  They were collected from Open Wet Ware, our advisors, and labs around the University of Illinois campus.

sRNA Characterization
Taken from: A Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-Based Plasmid System to Study Post-Transcriptional Control of Gene Expression In Vivo : Johannes H. Urban and Jörg Vogel, 2009
This protocol is used to characterize an E. coli small RNA and its ability to downregulate a reporter gene (GFP).  The small RNA is cloned out of the E. coli chromosome and inserted into a high-copy number plasmid (pJU-334).  The sRNA's target sequence is also cloned out of the E. coli chromosome and inserted into a low-copy number plasmid (pXG-10).  Both plasmids are then transformed into E. coli Top10F' cells.  Successful sRNA repression is indicated by a decreased level of fluorescence in the cells.
