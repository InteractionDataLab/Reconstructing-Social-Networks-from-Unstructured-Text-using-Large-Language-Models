sRNA Dual Regulation
Goals: The goal of this side-project is to explore possible ways of using two sRNAs to regulate a single mRNA transcript. Possible ways of achieving this include manipulation both the 5' and 3' untranslated region of the same mRNA transcript by two separate sRNAs. The possibility of manipulating the 5' end the the mRNA with two sRNAs through the use of different sRNA strands and possibly mutated sRNAs has also been explored, but this idea has been put on hold.
