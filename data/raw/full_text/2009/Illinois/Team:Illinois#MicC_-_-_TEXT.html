MicC Target-GFP Fusion
Primers Used:
June 15
PCRs of sRNA genes and target sequences were performed using E. coli extracted chromosomal DNA and primers.  We were able to purify the ompC gene on a 3% agarose gel, however no band was visible from the micC PCR product.
June 16
Another PCR of the micC gene was done.  Results should be analyzed tomorrow.
June 17
We performed a restriction enzyme digest of our small RNA and its target sequence.  We then ran a gel to purify the DNA.
