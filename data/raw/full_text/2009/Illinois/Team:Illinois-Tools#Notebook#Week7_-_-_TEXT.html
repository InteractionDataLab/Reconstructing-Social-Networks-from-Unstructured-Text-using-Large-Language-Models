7/5- 7/11
Donny
I created a graph library which I call dongraphlib to handle our specific functions. I took a look of code from NetworkX and pygraph but made modifications and left out everything we have no need for. I included a bidirectional dijkstra algorithm to make the shortest path calculation go extremely fast (less than a second!).
Palak
This week I worked on creating a script that would determine whether or not the reaction is reversible. I also worked on a few administrative tasks. I spoke with the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Research to discuss what kind of support they could provide us. I also took a look at a few grants that we could apply for in order to get funding for next year.
Kanishka
I worked on trying to blast through the biobrick database.  It took Riyad and I several days to get it to work.
Riyad Kanishka and I wrote a program to blast a sequence out program spits out and compare it to the entire BioBrick registry.
