SgrS
Colony Boil-Streak plate E. Coli K12 on LB agar, incubate overnight at 37C.  Pick healthy colony with sterile glass pasteur pipette and innoculate 100 uL dH20.  Boil for 10 min, centrifugate for 5 min at 14K rpm.  Extract 1 uL of supernatant as template DNA for PCR.

sgrS Gene and ptsG 5'UTR were PCR-cloned out of the chromosome using colony boil.  sgrS Gene was cloned with 3' XbaI restriction site.  ptsG Gene was cloned with 5' Mph1103I restriction site and a 3' NheI restriction site.
June 16
We ran a 3% agarose gel on our PCR reactions, and the PCRs were successful!  The SgrS gene falls just under the 300 bp region on our gel, which agrees with our data for the length of the SgrS gene segment.  The PtsG target sequence band is located at 200bp, which also agrees with our data for the length of the ptsG target sequence with its respective fused restriction sites. Reaction was purified with Nucleospin Extract DNA kit and stored at -20C.
June 17
Both sgrS Gene and ptsG 5'UTR were digested with restriction enzymes- XbaI and Mph1103I/NheI respectively. Reaction was resolved on 2% agarose gel, which was subsequently extracted and purified with the Nucleospin Extract DNA kit.  Final elution (15uL) was stored at -20C
