Post-Summer Progress
This section includes entries for lab work done after changes were made to the way the project was handled in lab when summer ended.
September 22
PCRed the plasmids containing the Lac promoter, the Tet promoter, CFP, YFP, and GFP.  The gel indicated poor results.  We found that the primers for the fluorescent protein genes can anneal on their overhang as well.  We will need to order new primers for these genes.
September 24
PCRed all target sequences w/ BB sRNAs w/ no results
September 25
PCRed sRNA genes (MicC, MicA, MicF) and their respective target sequences (OmpC, OmpA, OmpF).  The gel was run with the Vogel primers as a control since the previous attempt to PCR Biobricks failed.
Also PCRed plasmid pSB1A2.  Used 56°C for annealing temperature instead of 58°C and got better results.
Also restreaked plates of E. coli containing plasmid PJU-334 and Biobricks BBa_K091101, BBa_I0500, and BBa_R0040.
September 26
PCRed sRNA target sequences OmpC, OmpA, OmpF, FtsZ, PtsG, GalK,.  For PCRs, ran a 50 μL reaction using
4 μL chromosomal template
0.4 μL of each primer
5 μL 10x buffer
0.8 μL Pfu polymerase
1 μL dNTP mix
38.4 μL dH2O
Also digested OmpC, OmpA, and OmpF target sequences from yesterday's PCR.  The first round of digestions was run for three hours using
