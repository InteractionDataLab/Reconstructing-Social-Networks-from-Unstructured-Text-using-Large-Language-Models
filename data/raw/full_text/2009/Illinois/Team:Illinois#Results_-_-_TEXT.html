Results
In the course of our project, we have successfully constructed and characterized 5 sRNA genes and 8 sRNA target sequences, and we submitted them to the Parts Registry as Biobricks.  We have also verified by plate readings of cells transformed with both an sRNA gene and the corresponding target sequence-GFP construct demonstrate that these sRNAs are able to cause repression of a gene of interest.
We have thus introduced small RNAs as as a new category of functional parts in the Parts Registry.  We hope that this category will continue to grow and that future teams will take advantage of our Biobricks and implement small RNA-mediated repression into their projects.
