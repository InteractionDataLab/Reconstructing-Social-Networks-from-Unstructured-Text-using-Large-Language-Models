Collaboration
Experimental Collaboration
IIT Madras team had problems in building assembly of parts by ligating together. We collaborated with IIT Madras team and helped them figure out the problem that might have caused the bottleneck in building constructs.
Human Practices Collaboration
We had discussions on Human Practices in synthetic biology. The surveys conducted by Team Valencia and Team TUDelft helped us in our discussions. Our team took part in the survey on human practices by Team Valencia. On account of all team members replying to this survey, our team was awarded ‘Collaboration Gold Medal. We also took part in the survey undertaken by Team TUDelft on reductionist approach in biology.
