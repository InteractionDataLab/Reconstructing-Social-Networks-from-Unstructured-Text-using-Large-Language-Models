Collaboration
We worked closely together with the Freiburg Bioware team , and got great feedback and ideas from them.
Additionally we
supported Freiburg Bioware in modeling their reactions pathways. That included creating, partial solving and simulating systems of differential equations.
created logos, wiki-layout, t-shirts and the poster together with team Freiburg Bioware . Without their support, we would have run into serious problems doing all these things before the Jamboree. Thank you, Wetlab-Team!
involved Francois Le Fevre from team Paris in the creation of our project-concept and got great ideas and feedback from him. Thanks!
helped team Valencia by filling out their survey (Gold Medal for 100% team participation).
our instructor Raik is currently working in Barcelona, thus we represent already an international team not located at just one university.
Draft specification for SynBioWave 0.2
If you are interested in the future of SynBioWave, you can find the specification for your upcoming release in the road map on our Project page .
Human Practice
Together with team Freiburg Bioware, we created a international survey on the benefit and risk perception of Synthetic Biology.

Safety
When planning our project and writing our code we were considered the following safety and security issues: data safety, identity theft, malicious software, collection of personal data by Google, and biosecurity during parts and device design. We would not have started our project if Google would not have announced that the wave technology will become open source. According to the wave federation protocol everyone can host his own wave server and control access and security issues. The nature of the open source will ensure that no hidden malicious code is distributed and that updates can be controlled by the community. Our wave approach automatically provides remote storage and at the same time the user can save a local copy. This redundancy ensures data safety.
We hope that a future wave robot testing for pathogenic parts and assemblies will help to increase biosafety of synthetic laboratory work.
