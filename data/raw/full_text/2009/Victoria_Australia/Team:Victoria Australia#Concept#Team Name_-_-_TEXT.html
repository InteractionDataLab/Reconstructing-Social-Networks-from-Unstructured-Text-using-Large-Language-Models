TEAM NAME
TEAM MASCOT
The Koala in the Lab coat: "Fluoro Lou"
Although also short for Louis, our mascot has been called Lou as a play on words for the two letters: Lu
These letters form the beginning of the Latin words Lumen, Lux and Luz all used as names for Light.
Lou is a Koala, one of many distinct Australian animals, he sports a lab coat which shows he's ensuring his personal protection in the laboratory whilst creating a fluorescent bioligical lighting system that he has used to decorate the Eucalyptus leaves he is grasping.
