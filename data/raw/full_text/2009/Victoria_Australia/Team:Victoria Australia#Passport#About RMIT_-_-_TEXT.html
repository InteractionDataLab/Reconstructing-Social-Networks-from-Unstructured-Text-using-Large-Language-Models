RMIT's city campus
Welcome to Melbourne, Australia
There is a lot to love about Melbourne - just ask the locals. This sophisticated world city in the south-east corner of mainland Australia inspires a deep passion in those who live here.
Melbourne is very much about lifestyle. It is no huge surprise to residents that their city has been ranked as one of the world’s most liveable cities.
Melburnians love the city's vibrant energy, restaurants, fashion boutiques, café-filled laneways, cool bars, unbeatable galleries, spacious parks and village-like inner suburbs, each with its own special character. Melbourne is less than 200 years old and never sits still. Modern, cutting-edge designs add to the fascinating mix of heritage architecture and ensure the skyline is constantly changing.
Sometimes, the best part of visiting a new city is when you depart from the tourist trail. While the big attractions can be great fun, often it’s the more subtle “insider” experiences that leave you feeling really satisfied.
