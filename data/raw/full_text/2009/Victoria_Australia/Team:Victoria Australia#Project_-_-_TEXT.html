Overall project
We are developing biological fluorescent lights that operate in emergency situations, for example exit lighting in cinemas. We will use a fun application of the technology to “sell” our project at the Jamboree by producing multi-coloured biological Christmas lights for use on a tree or around the house or garden. Our project is innovative as these biological lights will operate in an ethical, environmentally friendly, safe and non-toxic manner, thereby addressing the major concerns society has raised in relation to synthetic biology.
