She plans to go to medical school and has a very wide span of interests, inluding iGEM. She is majoring in Philosophy and possibly double-minoring in English and Biology while taking the pre-med requirements. She also loves dabbling in, to varying degrees, chemistry, quantum physics, economics, astronomy, psychology, writing, marine biology, ornithology, and paleontology. She enjoys visiting aviaries, aquariums, zoos, museums, and all outdoor places. Laboratories are cool, too, even though they are indoors. She occasionally thinks about becoming a sailor, pilot, dolphin, pirate, bird, wolf, or wizard, but feels that being a doctor will make the most sense in terms of reality and long-term desires.</P><P>
Julie came from the sunshine state of Florida to the power state of New York City. She currently is majoring in Biochemistry and plans to pursue a field in medicine. Current hobbies of hers' include: reading, walking, knitting, Tae Kwon Do, Tennis, and dancing. She enjoys the outdoors, examples include: hiking, sitting in the park, and swimming. She happens to enjoy being part of a science team very much. Julie also enjoys observing, people tell her it is a sixth sense. She is now enjoying life with all her capabilities. Loves animals and always seeks to protect them. Will always fight for the freedom for others to be who they are and what they want to become. Never let anyone say you can't be or do something. Keep strong and keep the hope alive.</P><P>
Rafi's interest in genetic engineering stems from the fact that he himself is the first successful test tube baby. He lived in a well-lit cage until the project ran out of money and was moved to a dark basement.  He escaped and ended up in New York, where he attends university. He hopes to attend a DDS/PHD program after graduating. Although ambitious, there is no doubt that he will one day be found and returned to his cage in the basement.</P><TABLE style="color:#1b2c8a;background-color:#0c6;" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="62%" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Yeshiva_NYC" title="Team:Yeshiva NYC">Home</A></TH><TH align="center"><STRONG class="selflink">The Team</STRONG></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Yeshiva_NYC/Project" title="Team:Yeshiva NYC/Project">The Project</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Yeshiva_NYC/Parts" title="Team:Yeshiva NYC/Parts">Parts Submitted to the Registry</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Yeshiva_NYC/Modeling" title="Team:Yeshiva NYC/Modeling">Modeling</A></TH><TH align="center"><A href="/Team:Yeshiva_NYC/Notebook" title="Team:Yeshiva NYC/Notebook">Notebook</A></TH></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="printfooter">
