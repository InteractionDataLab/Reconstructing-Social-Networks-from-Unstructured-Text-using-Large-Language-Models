Protocol for purification of DNA from PCR mixtures or an enzymatic reaction
Sample capture
Add 500 ul Capture buffer type 2 to up to 100 ul sample
Mix thoroughly
Sample binding
Add Capture buffer-sample mix to assembled GFX MicroSpin columns and Collection tubes
Centrifuge for 30 sec at 16000 g.
Discard the flow through in the Collection tube and place the MicroSpin column in the Collection tube again.
Wash & dry
Add 500 ul Wash buffer type 1
Centrifuge for 30 sec at 16000 g.
Discard flow through and keep Collection tube as above.
Centrifuge again for 30 sec at 16000 g. More flow through will appear in the Collection tube. It is important to centrifuge this second time to get the sample completely dry. This step is not provided in the original protocol.
Discard Collection tube and transfer MicroSpin column to a clean 1,5 ml DNase-free microcentrifuge tube.
Elution
Add 10 – 50 ul Elution buffer type 4 or 6. We eluted with 10 ul in order to obtain a small volume and a high concentration of purified DNA. Only very big amounts of sample require higher elution volumes.
Leave at room temperature for 60 sec.
Centrifuge for 60 sec at 16000 g.
Retain flow through and discard MicroSpin columns
Store purified sample DNA at -20 degrees or proceed to cutting DNA or ligation.
