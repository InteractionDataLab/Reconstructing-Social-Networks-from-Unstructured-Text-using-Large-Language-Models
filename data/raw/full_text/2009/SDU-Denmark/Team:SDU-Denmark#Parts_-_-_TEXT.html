Our Parts on the registry
RIP -  - The heart of our project. This is the minimal sequence coding for RIP.  We have submitted a ligation mixture instead of a miniprep, due to temporal issues. PCR of the ligation mixture indicates that RIP has been correctly inserted.
sRIP -  -  RIP with an OmpA leader sequence, designed to let RIP leave the cytoplasm. We have submitted a ligation mixture instead of a miniprep, due to temporal issues. PCR of the ligation mixture indicates that sRIP has been correctly inserted.
ompA (Theoretical brick) -  - The leader sequence used for sRIP, which should allow for peptide exporting from E. coli.
RIP-Term -  - RIP combined with the double terminator
Constitutive Promoter-RBS-RIP- Term -  - Constitutive RIP generator.
Characterizations of these parts
As mentioned above, we haven't had time to obtain a sequence for the RIP and sRIP.
For both RIP-Term and our RIP generator we have obtained sequencing data, confirming the parts. Sequencing data can be accessed through the parts registry. Much more info about the parts can be found on our results page.
Contributions and improvements to existing parts
Our biggest contribution has been proving that the backbone housed in well 1K was not  as indicated by the partsregistry but instead . Here is a full description .
Also, we have improved the VR () primer for use with pSB1A2, psB1A3 and psB1AK3. here is the part: .
