First of all, studying medicine does not prepare the ground for scientific work, which I think is a petty. Second, I think its cool to make friends among different field of study. Third, but presumably most important; I would like to have some fun.

Although I've spend a lot of time in the lab doing projects on C. elegans metabolism and analysis of modified nerve terminal proteins, I've never been in touch with genetic engineering or even worked with single-celled organisms.
</P><P>When I think about all the opportunities in genetic manipulation, I just have to know the techniques. And learning this discipline by hands-on experiences together with a great team – in competition with others ;o) – sounds just pretty nice!

Additionally, experience with purification of DNA from tissue and copy number surveillance.
</P><P>I always seek new areas of study, because I find the world of life sciences very exciting. When the opportunity came up to do something with bacteria, I was interested right from the start, because I havent really worked in the area of prokaryotes before and I was eager to explore it.

My name is John. I am studying medicine at 5th semester here at the University of Southern Denmark. I have 3 reasons for joining the iGEM team here. First of all I'm very dedicated to all forms of science.  Second I think it is great to meet other students who have the same passion for science. At last I would also like to have more fun. :-)

I have great experience in project-management from the technical high school, but have very little previous experience with the microbiology lab.
</P><P>I joined the iGEM team because I always thought genetically engineering to be exciting and to gain valuable experience in this line of work. And mostly because it sounds fun.

</P><P>Regarding my motivation; I generally think that syntetic biology is a very interesting scientific field with great potentiel and I really look forward to joining the competition and meeting students from all over the world.
</P><P>I would like to work in medical research later on but our education doesn't really involve any lab work. So for me this iGEM project is also a great chance to get some lab experience and try some things that I would otherwise only read about. Beside from this I am strangely fascinated by bacteria ;o)

It has a lot of potential for real world applications and iGEM provides a perfect setup for us students to wrestle with new ideas and projects.
</P><P>About me: I study medicine and am currently on my 7th semester here at SDU. I've worked on detecting LOH in a rare cancer called multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma at Odense University Hospital and spent some time at University of Illinois a summer ago trying to be helpful at Kelly Tappendens lab. My bachelor thesis had the inspiring name: A Systematic Comparison of Cystatin C Based Formula's and The Creatinin Based Schwartz Formula for Determining Kidney Functions in Children.

</P><P>When presented with the “International Genetically Engineered Machine” project, I first imagined it as an immense and boundless project. 
But presented with the idea that the SDU-Denmark team had come up with, I became fascinated – could it be possible that they could generate a biological system, which could end up having a huge affect on the treatment of bacterial infection, just by an idea, some parts and a few months? 
</P><P>As pathogenesis and stress tolerance are main topics of my own research project, in which I am focusing on the virulence and stress response of Listeria monocytogenes, I use many of the molecular methods that the iGEM team are working with. Therefore I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our team by assisting them in the lab.

The results of such endeavors are far from predictable and give scientists a realistic perspective on the interconnectivity, programmability, and complexity of living systems.  This is an exciting time for students interested in living systems to try to reprogram them in specific and quantifiable ways.
</P><P>As an associate professor at SDU, I am primarily interested in developing laboratory models of complex systems that have life like properties.  This is done through my participation in the research center called FLinT (fundamental living technology).  Currently my research lies in physics and chemistry, but my interests are based in biology and evolution. 
</P><P>The team of students here came together under common interest, self organized and effectively initiated training in Synthetic Biology at SDU.  It is a pleasure for me to support their initiative, energy and curiosity.

</P><P>I am interested in the molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli cause disease. In my group, we aim to identify bacterial virulence factors and further characterize the molecular cross-talk taking place at the host-pathogen interface during infection. In this framework the C. elegans model organism is used extensively for both genetic and proteomic analyses of bacterial infection.
</P><P>As a supporter throughout the summer I have become truly impressed by the SDU iGEM team enthusiasm and genuine interest in science. They really make things happen, both in the lab and outside!

</P><P>I've been obsessed with the idea of assembling minimal from the bottom up since I was a student, and it's therefore a great pleasure for me to support our iGEM team.  iGEM is operating in the other end of Synthetic Biology also addressing &quot;what is life?&quot;, but from the top down through modifying and simplifying existing life-forms.  
</P><P>Perhaps as the field of Synthetic Biology matures, iGEM 3.0 will also include a competition for teams developing minimal life-like systems from the bottom up: minimal molecular aggregate motility; minimal energy transduction systems; autonomous sensing signal transduction and actuation systems; aggregate growth and division; evolution in minimal replicator systems, and the like.
