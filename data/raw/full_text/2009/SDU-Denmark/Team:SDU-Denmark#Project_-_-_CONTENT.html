</P><P>We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as <I>RIP</I> to pass through, into the wound.
</P><P>We have <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Background#Quorum-quenching_using_RIP" class="external text" rel="nofollow">reason to hope</A> that this will weaken the biofilm formation, thereby making multiresistant bacteria easier to treat with conventional antibiotics. This should also increase the effectiveness of the antibiotics and thereby decrease the amount and range of antibiotics that are needed today, to fight the infections.
</P><P>Since our system doesn't kill <I>S. aureus</I> but only prevents it from becoming pathogenic, it is less likely to promote the development of resistant strains.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Parts">Parts</SPAN></H3><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Our biological machine, composed of a <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_J13002" class="external text" rel="nofollow">promoter and RBS</A>, our novel <I><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K237002" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RIP</A></I> part and a <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_B0015" class="external text" rel="nofollow">double terminator</A>.</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Our idea is to compose a plasmid containing a promoter, which should either be constitutive or inducible. After the promoter sequence we have a RBS, and then our <I>RIP</I> sequence, which we based on the amino acid sequence of the protein and made in PCR via two flanking primers. We are working with a clean <I>RIP</I> sequence and a <I>RIP</I> sequence with an export sequence on it, called <I>sRIP</I>. Following the <I>RIP</I> sequence we have a terminator. 
</P><P>All the four parts were incorporated into an ampicillin resistant plasmid backbone.
</P><P>We designed our system with two different promotors, since we didn't know whether a high concentration of <I>RIP</I> will quorum quench the <I>E. coli</I> itself.  It will therefore be practical for us to control the rate of transcription - hence the inducible promoter.
</P><P>On the other hand we know that a higher concentration of <I>RIP</I> is more efficient in quorum-quenching <I>S. aureus</I>, and it will therefore be more efficient if the plasmid is transcribed at all times. Furthermore if the export of the protein out of the cell is weak, an overproduction of the protein might puncture the cell and <I>RIP</I> will leak out. This will of course kill the cells, but we don't see this as a big problem as they easily can be replaced. Our goal is to get as much <I>RIP</I> exported from the bandage to the wound one way or another.

</P><P>The assay was made on a 4*6-well plate. <I>S.aureus</I> were grown in the wells, thereby making biofilms. 
</P><P>We then added different <I>E. coli</I> components to the wells: supernatant, crushed pellet and living <I>E. coli</I>.

Cells remaining adhered to the wells are subsequently stained with violet blue, the solution stands for 15 minutes and was washed twice.
</P><P>1 ml of 96% ethanol was added to each stained well to loosen the biofilm.

The big question is whether or not, <I>RIP</I> gets exported out of <I>E. coli</I> and past the peptideglycan layer and capsule. The final results will be presented at the Jamboree.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Problems">Problems</SPAN></H3><P>Throughout most of the summer, we've had problems getting our ligations product sizes to match. What ever we tried nothing seemed to work, since it was always the wrong size. Then a few weeks ago, it was discovered, that the <A href="/Team:SDU-Denmark/Parts/backbone_troubles" title="Team:SDU-Denmark/Parts/backbone troubles">problem</A> was with our backbone (1K from plate 1, 2009 spring distribution), not our work. 1K was suppose to be , but instead it was .
</P><P>Sadly we didn't discover this till the very last week, and so we didn't get to do all the experiments we wanted, including one with an inducible promoter and one with our signaling peptide coupled with <I>RIP</I>. 
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Implications">Implications</SPAN></H1><P>If indeed our <I>E. coli</I> can inhibit biofilm formation by producing <I>RIP</I>, this generates many different opportunities for further development.
</P><P>Our machine opens up for the possibility to combat infections more intelligently. 
</P><P>As mentioned earlier we considered using a inducible promotor to control the expression of <I>RIP</I>. Optimally the promotor should react to the level of autoinducers in the environment by use of quorum-signaling receptors. 
The concept could also be implicated on other strains of bacteria performing quorum sensing with other types of autoinducers.
</P><P>A logical next step would be to couple several kinds of quorum-quenching molecules to our machine, together with different quorum-signaling receptors. This would allow for inhibition of only the specific bacteria that are currently infecting the wound.
</P><P>Essentially the Bacto-Bandage would sense if any kind of bacteria was trying to colonize the wound and inhibit this by means of producing the most effective quorum-quenching molecules.
