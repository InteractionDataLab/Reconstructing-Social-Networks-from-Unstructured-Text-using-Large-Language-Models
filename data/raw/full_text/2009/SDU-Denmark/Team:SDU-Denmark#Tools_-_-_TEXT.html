Plasmid ligation helper
To avoid having to manually calculate how many uL's of DNA and plasmid we should use to achieve optimal ligation circumstances, we created a small Program for the texas instruments calculators. It's simple called Ligation, and you can get it here .
A plasmid editor ( APE )
APE is a very powerful plasmid and linear DNA editor
APE is a very powerful plasmid and linear DNA editor. It has helped us analyse our data from the very beginning. Among our favorite features are:
Restriction site highlighting
Expandable feature library with quick discovery. Perfect for analysing sequence results for biobrick inserts.
DNA alignment feature. Another tool for analysing sequencing results
Creates plasmid maps for easy reviewing
Ape was created by M. Wayne Davis. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
Ligation
Q: How much DNA should be used in a ligation using T4 DNA Ligase?
A: The unit definition uses 0.12 μM (300 μg/ml) lambda HindIII fragments. The high DNA concentration can be used for linker ligation. To promote circle formation, useful in transformation, a lower total DNA concentration should be used. The overall concentration of vector + insert should be between 1-10 μg/ml for efficient ligation. Insert:vector molar ratios between 2 and 6 are optimal for single insertions. Ratios below 2:1 result in lower ligation efficiency. Ratios above 6:1 promote multiple inserts. If you are unsure of your DNA concentrations, perform multiple ligations with varying ratios.
