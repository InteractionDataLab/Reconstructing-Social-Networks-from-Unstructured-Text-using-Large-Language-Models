Medical
Membrane proteins express in bacteria
Bacteria that express certain membrane proteins which causes them to act like a vaccine or stimulate the immune system if this is suppressed in individuals. This might be an easy, fast and especially cheap way of producing vaccines.
Bacterial induced antibodies
Bacteria that express mutating parts of a virus and in that way act as a vaccine.
Bacteria in bloodstream
Non-pathogene bacteria which circulate in the bloodstream and remove plaques from the arterial wall – or recognize oncogenic cells which are on their way to colonize at distant sites in the body.
This idea requires that we can actually make bacteria, that doesn't get killed by the immune system while at the same time isn't harmful to the human body. If we can make a “skeleton” of this kind, then we can combat all kinds of diseases.
In association with the above idea, we thought about diagnosis of Lox cells, which have proven to be the first “scouts” sent out when metastasis is taking place.
Detection of early colon cancer
In the case of colon cancer, the malignant cells are situated in a place where bacteria have good access. Maybe bacteria could recognize colon cancer cells – and carry out competitive inhibition of EGF-R or in other ways manipulate the cancer cells. This idea has parallels to the function and behavior of vibrio cholerae. The colon has millions of bacteria already, so it's “easy” to introduce new ones here, since the environment is perfect for them. Colorectal cancer is a good place to start, since so many people die from it every year.
Treating hangover
Bacteria that synthesize the required enzymes for treating hangover.  This idea was emerge from tablets containing cactus extract, contented as a cure for hangover. Turns out very little is known about hangovers.
"The symptoms of the alcohol hangover are largely due to the activation of inflammation. An extract of the OFI plant has a moderate effect on reducing hangover symptoms, apparently by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators,"
“C-reactive protein, a protein produced by the liver, becomes elevated after injury or trauma and is thought to be involved in inflammation and alcohol hangovers. An extract from the skin of the prickly pear fruit, Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) has been shown to reduce inflammation”
Producing enzymes in the intestine
Bacteria situated in the ventricle or intestine, which produce the required but lacking enzymes of lactose-intolerant individuals. The idea could also be applied to gluten disorder (what is it called?).
Quorum-quenching
When bacteria colonize a distant site, they communicate by secreting chemical signal compunds in order to obtain information of their number. When the number of bacteria are reaching a certain amount, they suddenly turn to virulence and fight their host. The idea is to inhibit or degrade this chemical signal compound in order to keep infecting bacteria “dormant”. A specialized bacteria might perform this task.
Detecting foetal fibronectin
When the water breaks just prior to birth, one distinct protein can be measured in the amniotic fluid, which is foetal fibronectin. Some times is it hard to decide weather the water broke or not, and a test is desired. Maybe bacteria could sense the presence of foetal fibronectin (PAMG-1) in a secretion sample.  A chemical diagnostic test exists called AmniSure, but midwifes claim that the test needs too much amniotic fluid to be detected.
Clamydia testing
Many young people suffer from Clamydia, which is becoming more and more widespread. The development of a simple test for private use could give a quick, troublefree and frequent answer of the presence of Clamydia. We thought about panty liners or even pantys with sensing bacteria.
Environmental & climate
Fighting CO2
Transform CO2 to other chemical compounds which not participate in the greenhouse effect – or make possible the measurement of CO2 in air or liquids, which nowadays is a hard task to perform during experiments in the lab.
Measuring compounds in the air
Measuring the content of different dangerous compounds in the air
NOx fixating bacteria
NOx fixating bacteria – will it be possible to fixate different NOx in order to obtain energy or maybe N + O2.
Making sea water drinkable
Remove salt from sea water in order to give millions of people access to clean drinking water. The system was thought to be mobile which allows it to be brought to small and poor villages in the 3rd world.
Producing energy
Transform methane into other compounds and during this process obtain energy.
Bacteria that produce oil, which would ensure a steady supply of this vital fuel.
Fixate H2O from the atmosphere as H2O is the most abundant greenhouse gas.
Transform organic waste into energy, methane or maybe even diesel. This thought has been inspired from the massive loads of organic matter that we throw out every evening from dinner preparing, but the organic matter could also be hay or other.
Universe
Terraforming Mars
Produce H2O by the mean of photosynthesis, which is supposed to help gain a possible life environment for “bears” on Mars – or in other ways make living on Mars possible with regard to O2, H2O and so on.
Production
Storing sunlight
Bacteria that generate electrical power and use energy from sunlight. This is partly inspired by the electrical eel. This power generation might be powered from acid from the ventricle. One practical purpose for this is the ability of bacteria to generate power for an artificial heart.
Producing silk
Bacteria that produce silk, as this material is highly wanted for many purposes and is additionally very expensive because of the difficulty obtaining it from spiders.
Salmonella test
Test the presence of Salmonella in a quick and precise approach – maybe one could design bacteria that sense the Salmonella and change color or secrete certain compounds which can be measured. The test is meant as well for industrial as for private purposes.
Bacteria as preservatives
Bacteria as preservatives, which prevent the growth of mould.
Bacterial flashlight
Fluorescent bacteria that might function as a flashlight.
Trapping mosquitoes
The development of a device that attracts Malaria mosquitoes and traps them. Maybe bacteria could secrete the same Malaria attracting compounds as humans and in that way trap the mosquitoes.
Brainstorm
This is all the different ideas we got will having our brainstorm in the beginning of the year.
