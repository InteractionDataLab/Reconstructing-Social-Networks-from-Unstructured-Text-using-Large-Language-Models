Cadmium Sensor (BBa_K285104) expresses GFP as a function of Cadmium Ion concentration. The first part of the GFP Cadmium Sensor is the CadA regulatory element which increases expression in response increasing Cadmium concentration. This is followed by spoVG a ribosome binding site for Bacillus Subtilis. The GFP coding sequence follows. Note that the GFP Cadmium Sensor will only function with the czrA regulon found in Bacillus Subtillis.
Individual Parts
CadA Regulatory Region (BBa_K285101, [1] ) is the regulatory sequence upstream of the cadA gene (previously known as yvgW). This sequence is part of the czrA regulon and is regulated by the CzrA repressor which is derepressed in the presence of Cd2+.[1][2]
copZA Regulatory Region (BBa_K285102, [2] ) is the regulatory sequence upstream of the copZ and copA genes. Activation of the copZ gene proceeds by copper mediated induction by the CueR protein which binds to this region.[2]
mntH Regulatory Region (BBa_K285103, [3] )is upstream of the mntH gene is repressed by the MntR protein which is derepressed upon induction by Cd2+.[1][3]
