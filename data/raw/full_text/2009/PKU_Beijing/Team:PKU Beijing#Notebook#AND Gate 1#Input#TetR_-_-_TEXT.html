2009.7.4
Back in the Lab.
Tranformation(Parts listed below)
BBa_I14033
BBa_C0040
BBa_C0012
BBa_J09250
BBa_C0080
BBa_B0034
BBa_K093012
BBa_J37033
2009.7.5
Pick colonies of the transformation and shake in the incubator.
2009.7.6
MiniPrep tetR standard parts plasmid.(BBa_C0040)
Get 6 standard rbs plasmids From ShenShan.
21:40

2009.7.7
01:52
GEL to assess the digestion
CIAP the 6 rbs vectors.
Add to the digestion product 5ul CIAP Buffer and 1ul CIAP
Run a GEL to recycle the insert of tetR.
The Hole is too large, the band is missing. (Never use the largest Cone for 20ul recycle any more)
03:24
Digest the tetR plasmid again.
2009.7.8
The Primer(Made of Standard Prefix and Suffix arrived).
Add ddH2O to each tube.
PCR tetR plasmid (MasterMix) to see whether the primers work.
PCR protocol.
(the Band is too narrow which means that the PCR is not done very well)
Try Colony PCR
No Signal
Go to Lingli’s Lab, do gradient PCR.
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 62, 64
All of the temps works well.
It turns out that the thermocycler in our lab has no hot cap. So the liquid is on the tube cap when exposed to 94 centigrade.
2009.7.15
22:16
Help Wushuke with his PCR. The lacI1-1, lacI2-2, tetR2-2, tetR3-2, tetR3-1.
2009.7.16
MiniPrep 1-18P and 2-4O plasmid
Enzyme Digestion of 1-18P and 2-4O plasmid
SpeI
1ul
PstI
1ul

2-4O Plasmid
10ul
ddH2O 6ul
Several Trials and failures, 2-4O can not be digested normally, at least be TaKaRa Enzymes.
