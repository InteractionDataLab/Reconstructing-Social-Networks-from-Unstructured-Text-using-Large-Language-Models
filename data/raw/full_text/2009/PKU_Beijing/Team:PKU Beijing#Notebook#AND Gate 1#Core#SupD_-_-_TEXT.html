Results:
The digestion products are correct.
2009.7.29

Electrophoresis the digestion products and PCR products.
The order of the samples: marker, plasmids control, digestion products, PCR products under 54 centigrade, PCR products under 56 centigrade, PCR products under 58 centigrade.
Results:
Digestion products are weird, while the PCR products under 58 centigrade are specialized. As a result, recycle the PCR products under 58 centigrade.
