2009.8.16
Test if the tetR promoter system works well in the low-copy backbone.
Get tetR+promoter+GRP from Wu Shuke.
16:40
Digest the promoter and reporter system.

20:00
Electrophoresis to recycle the inserts.
The order of the samples: marker, digestion products, plasmids control.
Results:
Only the first one is correctly digested, recycle them.

10:00
Link the inserts with vectors with has Kanamycin resistance.
17:50
Transformation.
19:30
Start to incubate.
2009.8.18
10:00
There are many colonies on the plate.
PCR colonies to test if they are correct.
2009.8.19
9:30
Mniprep the plasmids.
The general concentration of the plasmids are about 150ng/μL. 11:00
Digest and PCR those plasmids to test if they are correct. The digestion system:

Start to digest&PCR. 16:30
Electrophoresis to test the digestion and PCR products.
All the clones have correct colonies.
17:00
Induce the strain containing tetR and low-copy backbone by aTc. 22:00
Using flow cytometry to test the induction results.
There are about 5 folds between the induced sample and the uninduced one.
