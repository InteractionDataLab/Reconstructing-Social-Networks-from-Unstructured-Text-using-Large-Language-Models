2009.8.1
Every plate is very well: more than 100 clones
PCR: (colony PCR, T-tetP)
System
10 uL
Master mix
5ul
primer (standard primer)
0.5uL each
water
4uL
template
10 colonies of T-tetP
Gel electrophoresis: (help by Lin Min)
Refer to Lin Min’s notes,
All of 10 colonies are wrong!!!
Repeat!!!

Transfer colonies: (L-lacP)
Transfer 6 colonies (L-lacP) into 5ml LB, and amplify the Ecoli.
Plasmid mini prep: (L-lacP)
6 colonies of L-lacP
Double digest: (to check the correct L-lacP)
6 L-lacP:
EcoR1
1uL
Pst1
1uL
plasmid
4uL
Buffer
2uL

12uL
37 ℃ overnight
2009.8.2
Gel electrophoresis: (check the correct L-lacP)
Products of double digest
Marker: 100bp 250bp 500bp 750bp 1kb 2kb 3kb 5kb
loading buffer and DNA dye: 6×
Voltage and time: 60V 5min; 120V 15min
I forgot to add the Marker, but from the result we can easily find that all these 6 colonies are wrong!!!
PCR: (colony PCR, L-lacP)
System
10 uL
Master mix
5ul
primer (standard primer)
0.5uL each
water
4uL
template
24 colonies of L-lacP
Gel electrophoresis: (check the correct L-lacP)
Products of PCR
Marker: 100bp 250bp 500bp 750bp 1kb 2kb 3kb 5kb
loading buffer and DNA dye: 6×
Voltage and time: 60V 5min; 120V 15min
From the lane 5 to the last one are 24 results of L-lacP PCR.
Since there is not any DNA larger than 1kb, all of these 24 colonies are wrong!!!
All these DNA are about 200bp. So they are the result of self link of lacP!!! There must be something wrong with the digested lacP!!!
Double digest: (again, lacP)

Lane 1~12: T-tetP 1~12
Lane 13: Marker
The insert is about 1kb, and 9 of these 12 colonies are CORRECT!!!!
Result
At last, I successfully constructed: Pcat-2M-lacI/tetR-term+lacP/tetP, and they are the parts K228817/18.
Experience
The vector is very important in this cloning. We should digest completely all the vectors, in order to prevent the self-linkage of the vectors. My experience is that if you want to digest 4ul plasmid as vector, you had better digest it overnight. If you want to quick such as in two hours, reduce the amount of plasmid.
