Modeling > ODE
Our design this year consists of four modules. For each module, we constructs ODEs(Ordinary Differential Equations) to describe the biological process. In this page, we will demonstrate all of our equations, the corresponding biological reactions, and parameters related. For parameters we used, please go to parameters page. For modeling result of the deterministic model, please go to result page.
AND Gate 1
The AND Gate 1 module works like this: Salicylate activates the transcription of T7 RNA polymerase with amber mutation while Arabinose activates the production of the tRNA. The AND gate part works as T7 RNA polymerase mRNA is translated, which is realized only when both salicylate and arabinose are present. Let's go downstreawm, T7 RNA polymerase protein activates the expression of CI(Trigger CI), which will trigger the state of the bi-stable module from CI434 to CI.
Synthesis of tRNA
Biological Process
Arabinose activates the transcription of supD gene, which will produce tRNA. tRNA interacts with animo acids to produce Aa-tRNA, which will be used in the translation process of T7 RNA polymerase. As translation proceeds, tRNA is regenerated as Aa-tRNA is consumed, which can contribute to the enrichment of its concentration. The AND Gate 2 will have a similar effect on the concentration of tRNA. Meanwhile, tRNA and Aa-tRNA degrade in a certain rate. The degradation of tRNA will decrease its concentration, while Aa-tRNA's degradation will produce more tRNA molecules considering the fact that the bond between tRNA and aminoacyl is weak.
Equation
Parameters
c_1: concentration of tRNA
k_1: maxinum transcription rate of tRNA
s_1: concentration of AraC, the stimulus
K_1: microscope dissociation constant
n_1: Hill co-effiency
γ_1: degradation and dilution rate of tRNA. Unless notice, "degradation rate" in this model means the combination of degradation rate and dilution rate.
γ_2': degradation rate of Aa-tRNA. This process DOES NOT consist of dilution, which will not break down the bond between tRNA and aminoacyl.
c_2: concentration of Aa-tRNA
k_2: rate of transformation from tRNA to Aa-tRNA.
c_4: T7 RNA polymerase, product of AND gate 1.
c_11: T3 RNA polymerase(P2), product of AND gate 2.
Synthesis of Aa-tRNA
Biological Process
Aa-tRNA is produced by tRNA and amino acids. Suppose that the amino acids are of large quantity in a cell, their concentration can be regarded as constant, which means that the production rate of Aa-tRNA can be describe by multiplying concentration of tRNA(c_1) by production rate(k_2). Aa-tRNA will be consumed in two AND gate while it keeps degrading in the cells.
Equation
Parameters
γ_2: degradation rate of Aa-tRNA
Synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase mRNA
Biological Process
Sal activates the transcription of T7 RNA polymerase.
Equation
Parameters
c_3: concentration of T7 RNA polymerase mRNA
k_3: maximum transcription rate of T7 RNA polymerase
s_2: concentration of Sal
K_3: microscope dissociation constant
n_3: Hill co-effiency
γ_3: degradation rate of T7 RNA polymerase mRNA
AND Gate 1
Biological Process
T7 RNA polymerase mRNA has two amber mutation. Only when Aa-tRNA synthesized from above reactions presents, can the translation process continues. Equation is adopted from J Christopher Anderson, et. al., Environmental signal integration by a modular AND gate, Molecular Systems Biology 3:133, supplementary information.
Equation
Parameters
k_4: maximum translation rate of T7 mRNA polymerase
k_s, γ_0: rate
γ_4: degradation rate of T7 mRNA polymerase
Synthesis of trigger CI mRNA
Biological Process
T7 RNA polymerase activates the transcription of CI. The translation of the exogenous CI mRNA is described in the same function as the translation of CI mRNA from the bi-stable switch.
Equation
Parameters
c_5: concentration of trigger CI mRNA
k_5: maximum transcription rate
K_5: microscope dissociation constant
n_5: Hill co-effiency
γ_5: degradation rate of trigger CI mRNA
Bistable
Bistable module was initially constructed by Chunbo Lou, a team member from PKU 2007 Team, also an instructor of our team this year. Here's the mechanism of the bi-stable module. CI(trigger CI and bi-stable CI) both activates the CI promoter and represses the CI434 promoter, while CI434 represses the CI promoter. Initially, the bi-stable was in the CI434 state. When the exogenous CI presents, the synthesis of CI is increased and the synthesis of CI434 is repressed. If the trigger is strong enough, the bi-stable will jump to the CI state which means the dog creates a link between food and bell.
Synthesis of bi-stable CI mRNA
Biological Process
CI promotes the transcription of CI, while CI434(from bi-stable) repressed this process.
Equation
Parameters
c_6: concentration of bi-stable CI mRNA
k_6 and k_6': transcription rates

K_6: microscope dissociation constant between CI promoter and CI

K_6': microscope dissociation constant between CI promoter and CI434
n_6': Hill co-effiency between CI promoter and CI434
γ_6: degradation rate of bi-stable CI mRNA
Synthesis of CI(trigger and bi-stable)
Biological Process
Trigger CI mRNA(from AND Gate 1 module) and bi-stable CI mRNA(from bi-stable module) are translated into CI protein.

AND Gate 2
T3 RNA polymerase(P2) is in exact same position of bi-stable CI from bi-stable module. CI activates its expression while CI434 represses it. The T3 RNA polymerase(P2) mRNA also has amber mutation, which can be translated into protein only with Aa-tRNA from AND gate 1 module presents. This is another AND gate, works exactly the same as the one in AND gate 1 module.
