Notebook > AND Gate 1 > Core > Transfer backbone: lacP+SupD/GFP to low copy pSB4K5
Transfer backbone: lacP+SupD/GFP to low copy pSB4K5
Motivation:
In order to make use of lacIQ of the F plasmid of JM109 (more detail refer to my notes 0817), the AND gates should be build on low copy plasmid. And transfer at this time can save a lot of workload.
Resource:
lacP-SupD-term (K228822): plasmid, from myself; renamed as LS;
lacP-GFP (K228821): plasmid, from myself; LG;
low copy backbone, pSB4K5: vector, has already digested by EcoR1 and Pst1, from ShenShan.
2009.8.21

All colonies are correct!!!
Result
I successfully transferred lacP-SupD-term (K228822) and lacP-GFP (K228821) to low copy plasmid pSB4K5.
