Project > Bistable > Result
Since we got the bistable switch directly from our 2007 iGEM team, and the bistable was tested intensively at that time and after the competition, we cited the result from them. When the bistable is on the pSB3T3 and transformed in to strain DH5alpha. Most of the colonies become green, while a fraction of them are red (fig 1). This means that the original state of bistable is on the GFP side: CI434, which is the very original state we need.

Furthermore, because we have successfully assembled AND gate 1 and bistable, the result of assembly also proves the bistable works well. For more detail, refer to our assembly result .
