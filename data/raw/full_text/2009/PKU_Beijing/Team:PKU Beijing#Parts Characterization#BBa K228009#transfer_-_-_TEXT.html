Transfer Function
Protocol
Description
The transfer function describes the equilibrium relationship between input (L-Arabinose solution at a gradient of concentration) and output signals (GFP fluorescence). For the purpose of characterization, we placed GFP coding gene (Part BBa_E0840) downstream of Pbad promoter to contruct a reporter system, which allows us to use Microplate Reader to test the arabinose inducible promoter indirectly via the green fluorescence output according to the concentration gradient of arabinose.
Data
This transfer function is a 120 min time-slice from the time and dose dependent input-output surface. Data points represent the mean of 6 individual measurements. The corresponding error bars represent the 95% confidence interval in the mean of the independent measurements. The Y axis denotes the value of fluorescence normalized by the OD600 value, and the X axis denotes the concentration of arabinose.  Notes: We used two different MicroPlate Readers to test arabinose and salicylate inducible promoters (Part Bba_K228009 and Bba_K228004) and they have different approaches to demonstrate fluorescence intensity. Thus, the results of fluorescence intensity tested by the two MicroPlate Readers are shown in correspondingly different magnitude.
