Molecular cloning: AND gate LSAT*9

lacP-SupD: plasmid, from myself; renamed as LS;
araC-T7ptag: insert (digested by Xba1 and Pst1), from GuoSheng Zhang.

Gel electrophoresis:
Products of PCR
Marker: 100bp 250bp 500bp 750bp 1kb 2kb 3kb 5kb
loading buffer and DNA dye: 6×
Voltage and time: 60V 5min; 120V 30min

lane14~17: 2I;
lane18+under row lane1, 2, 5: 1J;
Under row lane3, 4: Marker
Under row lane6: negative control;
If the colony is correct, its insert should be 4.6kb. So we can find only 2I and 1J are correct! REPEAT!!
Because the insert is large, sometimes can not be amplified by taq enzyme, I decided to mini prep some of them.
Transfer the colonies: 2M(2), 5J, 5N, 1H, 2K, 2I(1, 3), 1J(3, 4) into 5 mL LB each.
Double digest (2nd time):
LS1:

Pst1

Buffer
2uL.
37 ℃ overnight

Plasmid mini prep:

Gel electrophoresis:

loading buffer and DNA dye: 6×
Voltage and time: 60V 5min; 120V 30min
Lane1: lacP-SupD digested by Spe1 and Pst1
Lane2~5: Single digest:, 5J, 5N, 1H, 2K,
Lane6, 12: Marker;
Lane7~11: Double digest: 2M(2); 2I(1, 3); 1J (3, 4);
Lane13~17: single digest: 2M(2); 2I(1, 3); 1J (3, 4);
Correct colony should have 3.4k vector and 4.6k insert, and the whole plasmid is 8k. And from the gel: we found that only 2I(1, 3), 1J (3, 4) are correct, which consistent with the result of PCR.

Correct colony should have 3.4k vector and 4.6k insert, and the whole plasmid is 8k. And from the gel: we found that all of they are CORRECT!!!
Result
I have already successfully constructed all the night AND gates: LSAT lacP-SupD-AraC-T7ptag, and they are parts K228823~31.
Now I finished all the cloning!!!
Appreciate every member of our iGEM group!!!
Go on to test my AND gates
