2009.10.1
Positively transform 1-9C plasmid, intending to get pSB3T5 plasmid backbone.
One 5ml culture of LB medium and antibiotic (Tetracycline, 50ng/ml) was inoculated with a single positive colony from a LB agar plate. Cultures were grown in tubes for 14 hrs at 37°C with shaking at 70 rpm.
2009.10.2
Miniprep of the fresh culture containing 1-9C plasmid.
Digest 1-9C plasmid and T7p + RBS + CI plasmid with XbaI and PstI Double digestion system:
1.5μL
XbaI
1.5μL
PstI
2μL
10×M buffer
10μL
1-9C plasmid (5μL for T7p + RBS + CI plasmid)
5μL
ddH2O (5μL for T7p + RBS + CI plasmid)
20μL
Total
Electrophoresis the digested samples, and extract the 1-9C plasmid backbone and T7p + RBS + CI insert.
2009.10.3
Ligate the T7p + RBS + CI insert to 1-9C plasmid backbone.  System:
3μL
insert
1μL
T7p vector
1μL
10× Ligase buffer
1μL
Ligase
4μL
ddH2O
10μL
Total
Transform the ligation product, and plate on agar plate.
2009.10.4
Pick 3 colonies for each RBS, 18 colonies in total, incubated in LB medium with Tetracycline, 50ng/ml for 14 hrs.
Miniprep these 18 culture samples.
Digest the plasmids with XbaI and PstI to detect the successful ligation.  Double digestion system:
1.5μL
XbaI
1.5μL
PstI
2μL
10×M buffer
10μL
sample plasmid
5μL
ddH2O (5μL for T7p + RBS + CI plasmid)
20μL
Total
Electrophoresis the digested samples detect the successful ligation. The result showed that all the colonies did come from successful ligation.
