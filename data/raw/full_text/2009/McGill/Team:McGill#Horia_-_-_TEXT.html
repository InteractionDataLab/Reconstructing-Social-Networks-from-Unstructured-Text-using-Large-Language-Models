Horia Vulpe
Hi, I'm a 2nd year medical student at McGill. My name, Horia, was the name of a famous Transylvanian revolutionary who was broken on the wheel after his peasant army was crushed by the Hungarians in 1784. When not fighting social injustice, I like to make e.coli glow green, sleep in till the afternoon and eat loads of romanian food. I have yet to try one of Faisal's mathematically correct grilled cheeses, but I'm sure they're delicious. See you all at the Jamboree!
