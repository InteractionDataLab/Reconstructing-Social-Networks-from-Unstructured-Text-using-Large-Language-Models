Dear sponsor,
By supporting McGill's 2009 iGEM competition team, you will make it possible for a group of motivated undergraduates and graduates to participate in a life changing experience. The international Genetically Engineered Machine competition is an international gathering of teams from over 100 participating universities where summer projects in synthetic biology are judged by a panel of specialists from academia and industry. Your company will be guaranteed exposure at this international event, which is held at MIT's Stata Center in November 2009. The Jamboree will showcase the scientific achievements of universities and institutes from all around the world, with hundreds of students, academics, journalists as well as the general public in attendance. Our sponsors will be acknowledged during our presentation, which will be viewed by a large audience at the conference, and which will also available on the internet for the general public for years to come. Your logo will also be displayed on this website, on our poster, on team T-shirts and in any conferences in which we participate.
Your kind donations will go towards:
the purchase of scientific supplies
transport to and from Boston, and accommodation
team t-shirts
registration at the competition
Donations to the McGill iGEM team are done via McGill University, and hence are considered a charitable gift. McGill's Business Number is 11912 8981 RR0001
