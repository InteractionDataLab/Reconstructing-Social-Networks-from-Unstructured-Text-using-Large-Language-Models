Faisal Naqib
I'm a graduate student in physiology at McGill University where I'm studying the application of mathematical modeling to the field of neural plasticity. Before I came to McGill I completed a Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada majoring in applied mathematics and minoring in biology. I'm interested in translational sciences, whether it be mathematical biology and medicine, synthetic biology, or using sophisticated mathematical techniques and engineering principles to figure out how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.
Also, I'm apparently the only team member that could find a picture of myself that did not involve me wearing a lab coat. Success.
