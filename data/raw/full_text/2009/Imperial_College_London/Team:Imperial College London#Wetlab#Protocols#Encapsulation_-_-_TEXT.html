Colanic Acid
Aims
Colanic acid biosynthesis is both time consuming and metabolically expensive. If the E.ncapsulator is to be used in an industrial setting, then colanic acid mediated protection must be highly efficient. Protective efficiency can be defined as the percentage increase in fluorescence per µl of colanic acid produced (when compared to control cells). The following assay can be used to elucidate this parameter.
Assay
This assay can be divided into several phases as shown below:
Growth of cells (Assay preparation).
Measurement of cell density.
Measurement of packed cell volume (PCV).
Measurement of the % change in GFP fluorescence following acid incubation.
