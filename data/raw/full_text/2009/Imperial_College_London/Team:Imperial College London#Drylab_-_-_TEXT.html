Welcome to the Dry Lab!
The goal of the Dry Lab has been to support the Wet Lab by answering questions of interest. The primary function of the models is to instruct the data analysis once results are gathered from the lab. Conclusions from the models aim to provide the team with a functional understanding of the system as well as design considerations that should be addressed in the genetic constructs. We have implemented several  models, explaining the behaviour of different parts of the system. Below is a summary:
Modelling in this project has been important in defining the "Engineering constraints" of the project, and in particular, we have focused on quantifiying the temporal control .
