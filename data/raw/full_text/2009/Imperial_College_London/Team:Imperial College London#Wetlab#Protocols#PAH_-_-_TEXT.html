PAH
Introduction
This assay allows us to quantify the amount of tyrosine in the sample, thanks to spectrophotometry. The enzyme of interest, PAH, degrades Phenylalanine into Tyrosine. By shining light at the optimal wavelength of the enzyme cofactor, we obtain absorbance readings. Using the Beer-Lambert law, we can then determine the concentration of the amino acid. Subsequently plotting this information (absorbance readings) against time, allows us to determine the activity rate of the enzyme. However, we need to assume that only the PAH enzyme is able to catalyse this reaction.
Considerations
In order to carry this assay out correctly, we need to lyse the cells to obtain what is called a crude extract. This will be a 'soup' of all proteins -including the PAH enzyme- that were contained in the bacteria. Selectiveness for Tyrosine is introduced by choosing the wavelength of the beam to be the optimal wavelength of the enzyme cofactor.
This step has been added to the protocol below in red.

5) Mix by swirling and heat at 55°C for 30 minutes. Cool to 25°C and centrifuge for 3 minutes. Transfer the solutions to suitable cuvettes and record the A450nm for the Test, Blank, Standards and Standard Blank with a suitable spectrophotometer.
Standard Curve
DA450nm Standard = A450nm Standard - A450nm Standard Blank
Prepare a standard curve by plotting the DA450nm for the Standards versus micromoles of Tyrosine.
Sample Determination
DA450nm Sample = A450nm Test - A450nm Blank
To determine the total micromoles of L-Tyrosine produced using the Standard curve.
Units/ml enzyme= ((mmoles L-Tyrosine produced)(df))÷((0.02) (8))
df = Dilution factor
8 = Time correction factor (in minutes) as per Unit Definition
0.02 = Volume (in milliliters) of enzyme used in the assay
Units/mg solid =  units/ml enzyme ÷  mg solid/ml enzyme
Units/mg protein = units/ml enzyme ÷  mg protein/ml enzyme
UNIT DEFINITION
One unit will convert 1.0 mmole of L-phenylalanine to L-tyrosine per min at pH 7.2 and 25°C, using DL-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterine as cofactor.
