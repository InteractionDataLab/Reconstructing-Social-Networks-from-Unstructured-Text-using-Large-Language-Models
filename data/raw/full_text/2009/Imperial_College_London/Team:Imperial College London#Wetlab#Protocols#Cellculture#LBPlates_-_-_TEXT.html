Send LB agar for autoclaving (before 12.30)
Day 2
Get LB agar from autoclave
Switch water bath to 50C
Microwave LB agar flask until agar dissolves
Put the LB agar flask into the water bath for 20-30 mins (this ensures the agar is dissolved properly)
Turn on the Bunsen burner. From now on work next to the flame for sterile technique.
5 minutes before pipetting (see next step), take antibiotics out of the freezer and let them defrost
When antibiotics have defrosted, add 200μL of antibiotic to 200mL of LB agar. Ratio of AB:LB is 1:1000
