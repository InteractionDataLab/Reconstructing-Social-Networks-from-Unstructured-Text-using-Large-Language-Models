Model Assumptions
LacI assumptions:
The lac operon represses by constitutively synthesizing the LacI gene product [ref1].
Here we have assumed that all the other complicated dynamical pathways are at dynamic equilibrium [ref2], and we are only considering the LacI gene.
If these effects were included, the dynamics of the entire system will be more complicated, and the outcome of the model will be different.
In a culture grown overnight, levels of LacI expression will have reached steady state. We can assume that this is the case before we add in IPTG.
IPTG assumptions:
LacI and IPTG undergo a secondary set of reactions when IPTG is added in. We assume that 1 molecule of IPTG binds to 1 molecule of LacI, creating an intermediate reaction complex:
We also assume that the concentration of IPTG we put in is below the threshold of toxicity that could significantly start killing our cells.
Literature review on IPTG
In this model we have neglected the degradation rate of IPTG and also of the [IPTG-LacI] complex.
The model
We can describe the behavior of the system with 4 ODEs. In this system, the first two equations describe the expression of LacI protein, and these will be linked to how it represses production of the protein of interest.
In the absence of IPTG the system becomes:

When IPTG is introduced the system becomes:
