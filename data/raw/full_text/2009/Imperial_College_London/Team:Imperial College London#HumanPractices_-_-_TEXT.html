Human Practices
For many within the scientific community, Synthetic Biology is a very exciting new area of technology with great potential. However, there are many social and ethical issues which must be addressed if the field is to be able to develop safely.
For these reasons, we here at Imperial iGEM felt it was important to explore the Human Practices issues and questions surrounding the project.
