Calibration protocols (CA)

Overview and Aims
CA1:Calibration Curves
TOP10 Growth
* To produce a calibration curve to aid in the normalising of absorbance values.  The relation of absorbance reading to number of cells varies with different cell strains. We are therefore doing one for Top-10.
CA2:External GFP fluorescence
External fluorescence
* To relate how the fluorescence observed can be correlated with number of purified GFP molecules
CA3:Internal GFP fluorescence
Intracellular fluorescence
* To relate how various intracellular concentrations of GFP leads to different observed fluorescences. This allows us to relate measured fluorescence from cells to actual GFP number
