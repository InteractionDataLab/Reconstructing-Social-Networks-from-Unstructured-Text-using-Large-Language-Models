Sequence Description
Coding
RcsB is a receiver protein which acts as a positive regulator of a number of genes including capsule genes responsible for colanic acid production.
Coding
Dam (DNA Adenine Methylase) The methylase encoded by the dam gene ( Dam methylase ) transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 position of the adenine residues in the sequence GATC, this protects the DNA from cleavage.
Coding
Colanic acid global regulator ygiV (B3023) increases the production of colanic acid further in conjunction with RcsB by acting as a repressor for mcbR/yncC promoter. YncC/mcbR normally repress colanic acid overproduction so as to increase biofilm formation.
Coding
Waal Ligase is an enzyme responsible for the ligation of an O-antigen to the core oligosaccharide in the Gram-negative bacterium's outer membrane.
Coding
OtsA is the first of two required in the conversion of glucose to trehalose .
This enzyme catalyses the following reaction:
UDP-glucose + D-glucose 6-phosphate -> UDP + alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate
Coding
OtsB This enzyme is the second of two required for the conversion of glucose to trehalose .
This enzyme catalyses the following reaction:
alpha,alpha-trehalose 6-phosphate + H2O -> alpha,alpha-trehalose + phosphate
Coding
Cellulase mainly catalyses the reactions that changes crystalline cellulose to cellobiose and then finally to glucose. This cellulase is protease resistant.
Coding
Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the enzyme that breaks down phenylalanine to tyrosine . Deficiency of this enzyme activity results in the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria .
Coding
Restriction enzyme DpnII is a Type II restriction enzyme that recognises the sequence GATC.  Its activity can be blocked by dam methylation.
Coding
Restriction enzyme TaqI is a Type II restriction enzyme that recognises the sequence TCGA. Its activity can be blocked by dam methylation.
Coding
This Lamda cI repressor has a cI857 mutation that results in denaturation of the repressor when the temperature is raised from 30 to 42°C, thereby allowing lambda promoter expression.
When the temperature is raised, typically to 42°C, the functionality of the protein is lost and the cI repressor is no longer able to bind to the operators on its promoter. Therefore, lambda promoter expression increases.
Regulatory
Lambda promoter (cIts responsive) is different from the common lambda promoter in that it is able to be repressed by the temperature sensitive cI protein (BBa_K200011). When it is not being repressed after 42°C induction, it acts as a strong promoter.
