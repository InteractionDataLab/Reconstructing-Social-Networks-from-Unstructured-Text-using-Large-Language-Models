Extracting DNA from the registry
Label a 1.5ml eppendorf with the BioBrick number.
Take plates from the iGEM freezer. On the paper in the plastic packet write down information regarding the DNA you wish to extract. Include BioBrick number, kit plate, well number and resistance.
Find the well number you wish you extract and mark the foil with a pipette tip.
Using 10ul ddH20, pierce the foil where marked and pipette up and down. The water and DNA will stain red.
Remove the DNA and add it to the labelled 1.5ml eppendorf.
Place the registry back in the freezer.
