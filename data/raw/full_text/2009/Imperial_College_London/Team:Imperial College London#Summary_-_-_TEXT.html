BioBricks
Submitted 20 documented parts to the Registry.
Improved the characterisation of the BBa_K098995 thermosensitive promoter by successfully testing with GFP.
Improved the characterisation of the Part:BBa_K118011 glucose-sensitive promoter by successfully testing with GFP.
Submitted new coding regions for 2 enzymes, PAH and cellulase , as well as a pentapeptide, opiorphin .

Functional BioBrick BBa_K200022 and BBa_K200018 characterised, and results uploaded onto registry page.
Engineering
Explored the Manufacturing Considerations that we thought important to manufacture The E.ncapsulator as a viable product.
Conceptualised a novel engineering technique of integrating our 3 modules.
Ethics
Explored the current Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology, as well as those specific to our project.
Took part in the Valencia ethics survey, and became the first team to win the Valencia Ethics gold medal.
Investigated the safety implications of the project as a whole.
Others
Helped the iGEM newcomers UCL by sending them a plate of Registry DNA kit plate from 2007.
