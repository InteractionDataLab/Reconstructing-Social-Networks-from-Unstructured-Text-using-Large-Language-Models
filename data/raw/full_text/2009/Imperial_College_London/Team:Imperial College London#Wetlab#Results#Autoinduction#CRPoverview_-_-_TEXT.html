GFP is being expressed whenever CRP is present
14000 A.U vs. ~5000 A.U. for control
- Probably shows that 0.05% glucose does not repress promoter
However, the GFP fluorescence is around 10 fold less than constitutive GFP
constitutive GFP (I13522) = 1186776 A.U
OD of cells around 1.5
Ref: Prelim test 07-10
CRP fluorescence by Xylose and Glucose varies by 30%, but the GFP output for both are quite low
- Possible suppression by Xylose
No c onstitutive to compare with in this experiment
Ref: CRP GFP 09-10
Too messy to analyse anything
Ref: Prelim CRP responsive media 10-10
Cells grown in pure secondary carbon source without glucose
Highest normalised fluorescence by 0.5% Rhamnose, 10% Casamino Acids and 20% Casamino Acids.
However, highest OD is for 10% CA (therefore chosen media)
Ref: CRP GFP 13-10
(by sampling)
There is a difference in fluorescence and normalised fluorescence between CRP constructs and controls.  (therefore, CRP constructs produce GFP)  This difference can be seen in fluorescence after 4 hours, but can only be seen in normalised fluorescence after 12 hours.
The fluorescence is however still about 10-11 fold less than constitutive GFP.
There appears to be slight repression of GFP fluorescence due to glucose for 0.05% glucose and 0.5% glucose.
However, this is only shown after about 12 hours, and there does not seem to be a clear change in time delay with increased glucose.
Ref: CRP GFP 14-10
(By plate reader.  Glucose was increased to 2% to test repression)
There is a difference in fluorescence between CRP constructs and controls, but this difference is only seen after about 11 hours.
However, the normalised fluorescence is messy.
The fluorescence is however still about 10-11 fold less than constitutive GFP.
No real difference between no glucose and 2% glucose.
