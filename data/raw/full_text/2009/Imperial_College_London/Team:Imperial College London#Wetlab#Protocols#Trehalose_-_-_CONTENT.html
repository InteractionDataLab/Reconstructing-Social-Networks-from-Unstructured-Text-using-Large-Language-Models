To do this, we need two pieces of information. Firstly, we need to monitor cell growth to know the approximate cell count. This can be done by OD to obtain cell count. Secondly, we need to know the rate of production of trehalose. This can be obtained from performing the trehalose assay at regular time intervals of 30 minutes. From the second piece of information, we can plot a graph of trehalose concentration against time. The gradient of this graph would give us the total activity of cells. Dividing this by the number of cells will give us activity per cell per unit time. This should resemble a hill function. 
</P><P>We can also perform the above mentioned two steps for different concentration of HSL. This will also allow us to characterise our biobrick.

Subsequently, store the bottles in an upright position. Stable for &gt; 4 years at 4°C.

5. Use the contents of bottle 5 as supplied. Stable for &gt; 4 years at room temperature.

</P><P>NOTE: The D-glucose standard solution (solution 4) and the trehalose preparation (solution 5) are only assayed when there is some doubt about the accuracy of the spectrophotometer being
used or where it is suspected that inhibition is being caused by substances in the sample. The concentration of trehalose is determined directly from the extinction coefficient of NADPH.

Mill dry samples to pass a 0.5 mm screen. ie: strainer with square holes of sides 0.5mm
<B>Samples containing 0-12 % trehalose</B>
1. Accurately weigh 1.0 g of the sample into a 100mL dry pyrex beaker and add 40 mL of 80°C hot distilled water. Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer and stir and for 15 min.
(i.e. until the sample is completely dispersed). 
2. Quantitatively transfer the solution to a 50 mL volumetric flask.
Adjust the volume to the mark with distilled water, mix the
contents thoroughly and allow to cool to room temperature.
Re-check the volume and adjust to the mark with distilled water if
necessary. <B> Samples containing 12-40 % trehalose   </B>

3. Filter an aliquot of the solution through a Whatman No. 1
(9 cm) filter circle. This solution may be slightly turbid, depending on the
nature of the sample extracted. Analyse this solution immediately, or
store at 4°C until analysed. If a turbidity forms in the solution, filter
it again before analysis. 
B. Removal of Reducing Sugars:
a. Accurately dispense a 0.2 mL aliquot of the solution to be analysed
(containing approx. 0.2 to 2.4 mg/mL of trehalose) into the bottom
of a glass test-tube (16 x 100 mm).
8
Note: For samples containing 40-100 % trehalose, adjust the volume
to 250 mL with DI water.
b. Add 0.2 mL of Reagent 2 (alkaline borohydride solution) to the
tube, stir the mixture vigorously and store at 40°C for 30 min to
effect complete reduction of reducing-sugars to sugar alcohols.
c. Add 0.5 mL of Reagent 3 (200 mM acetic acid) to the tube with
vigorous stirring on a vortex mixer. A vigorous effervescence
should be observed. (This treatment removes excess borohydride
and adjusts the pH to approx. 4.5.)
d. After 5 min, add 0.2 mL of solution 1 (2 M imidazole buffer, pH 7.0)
to adjust the pH of the solution to approx. 7.
This is the sample solution and should be analysed as described
on page 5.

The amount of trehalose present in the cuvette (i.e. in the 0.2 mL of sample being analysed) should range between 4 and 80 μg. Thus, the sample solution before the borohydride reduction step must be diluted sufficiently to yield a trehalose concentration between 0.12 and 2.4 g/L.
