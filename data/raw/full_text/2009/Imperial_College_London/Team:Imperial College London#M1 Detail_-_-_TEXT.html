Polypeptide Classification
Polypeptides are classified according to their size and functional properties. Peptides are short chains of amino acids that often play a role in signalling and enzyme inhibition. At the other end of the spectrum, we have proteins which are much larger with complex three dimensional structures. Enzymes are a class of proteins which serve to accelerate the rate at which chemical reactions occur in the cell.
To demonstrate The E.ncapsulator's versatility, we have chosen to showcase it with both enzymes and peptides. These two classes of polypeptide have very different properties that we have considered and catered for in The E.ncapsulator's design.
