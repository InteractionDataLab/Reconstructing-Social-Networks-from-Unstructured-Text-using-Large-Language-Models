Project Overview
Growth
Growth
We are growing the cells to a desired OD of 0.7 in order to ensure that there are enough cells to produce a wanted amount of proteins
Module 1: Protein Production
Module 1: Protein Production
The first module is induced with IPTG and triggers the production of the protein of interest. As part of this project we have looked into two proteins and a peptide of interest.
Module 2:
Clearance of Urea
A Urea clearance device.
Guanidine

The device managing the clearance of guanidino compounds.
Phosphate
Clearance of Phosphate
A Phosphate clearance and balance device.
