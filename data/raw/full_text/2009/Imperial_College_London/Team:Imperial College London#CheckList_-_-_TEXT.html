Main Points
Too many results/ modelling pages. Dineka royah and i propose getting rid of the modelling and results links from each module. Instead just have links from the main page to the wet and dry labs. Perhaps under 'Data' tab or something, could have a very brief overview of each? Also, if we have these tabs under each module, it will draw attention to the lack of results should we not have them by wiki freeze.
Links to different parts of the wiki should perhaps not be put as blue hyperlinks in brackets. not very obvious. might be good to have wikipedia links for words that non-biologists like me might not understand! we are simple folk after all.
REFERENCES, sooooo important. Look on OWW for the ones we have been using, otherwise search.
Layout Comments
Comic strip of system: charles, whats the situation of the flash animation? we want it done asap. otherwise i can upload each of the 4 images as a seperate file with hyperlinks.
Page by Page Breakdown
Homepage : Completed  (Needs Checking)
Project Overview : Complete (Needs Checking)
Major Results: These should be stuck up as they come in. Also might be good to just put in some text describing our major experiments should we not get results in time. Certainly wouldn’t be good if come wiki freeze time we have a blank page for major results, sortof highlights the fact that nothing has worked.
Submitted Parts: List of biobricks looks good. My bad on putting them all as coding regions, some need to be changed to composite parts that we have had ordered.
Achievements: No text here, needs to be sorted out. What do we expect to put up? Perhaps the list of gold medal criteria with tick boxes for example.
Manufacturing Considerations: Needs a lot more writing. Also formatting, looks good, but perhaps put some of the images on the right. Also caitlins point about the quality control image being a little un-pc for some of the judges on the more conservative side.
Module 1 Main Page : Needs a lot of formatting and checking
Module 1 Link, enzymes and polypeptides: Needs a lot of work
( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/M1_Detail ) Module 1 Peptide Processing link: Needs a lot more work ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/PPS )
Module 1 Opiorphin: ???!? ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Opiorphin )
Module 1 PKU: Lots of formatting, and a bit more info maybe some more link
( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/M1/PKU ) Module 1 PAH: More info, formatting, pictures ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/PAH )
Module 1 Cellulase: No info on here, needs writing, pictures everything
( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/M1/CelE )
Module 1 Genetic Circuit: NO VIDEO, charles, can you do this! Needs much more written explanation as well. ( https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/M1/Genetic )
Module 1 Results: Nothing on here yet (Obviously), write a bit about our experiments so that when results come in, all we need to do is stick them straight in. Also, link to wetlab hub at bottom, saying more results can be found here.
Module 1 Modelling: Looks very empty, needs filling up. A brief description about each model would be useful along with the links, so that they can get an understanding about what it is for before clicking further.
Module 2 Main Page: Content looks ok, needs checking. Also, formatting of images etc. Link at bottom of the page to the genetic circuit
Module 2 Proteolysis: More information needed. Dont think the protease cutting application is needed, who is really going to bother with that? More content, and a link to the site the app is from.
Module 2 RcsB,YgiV,RfaL Link: This needs a lot of work! Very important though, central to our project. References need to be solid. Information about each needs to be clearly laid out, with pictures if possible. Literature review maybe of the papers we used? BIG JOB
Module 2 Trehalose: Needs more info, formatting, images
Module 2 Genetic Circuit: Generally good, more formatting and written information needed.
Module 2 Picture Gallery: Nothing here. Bit of writing, so that when pictures come in, minimal writing needs doing when uploading. We have stills from the experiments, can we not put these up?
Module 2 Results: Empty. Write a bit about the experiments we are doing, so that when results come in, can be updated quickly.
Module 2 Modelling: Bit more information. Dont really like the tabs at the top. Perhaps put it all on one page. What is the old tab for?!
Module 3 Main Page: Much more detail needed. Can the text be formatted with the images? ie, one image to the left, with text on the right, one image on the right, with text on the left. Also, dont particularly like the DNA lightning bolt image, doesnt look good. can it be replaced by something else? perhaps the scissors that were used in the comic strip? Information about each restriction enzyme, and dam. Please put the detail up!! Also, more on harvard, big thing! Ethical implications, why is that here?!? Also, link goes to the stomach page. BIG JOB
Module 3 Ethical implications learn more: Is it needed here? If so, a literature review of some GM debates or something might be good.
Module 3 Genetic Circuit: Good start. Bit of writing before video introducing, better description of the genetic circuit. Read over it and modigy.
Module 3 Results: Empty. Write a bit about the experiments we are doing, so that when results come in, can be updated quickly.
Module 3 Modelling: Looks alright really. References need putting at the bottom. Also, more images should be uploaded to make it a bit more exciting. Also, perhaps make the drylab hub link more obvious. that is where everything needs to point to after all. Writing still needs a bit more detail.
Temporal Control Main Page: Looks good. Royahs image needs a bit more description to make it obvious. explain why gfp/ rfp goes up etc. Not obvious to an independant reader. similarly give a sentence about the autoinduction etc and why it is used. further detail can follow further down the page and in the link.  Regarding the rest of the page, looks food, particularly liking all the images. Needs formatting to space everything out and make it look good. Also, dont really like the hyperlinks being the Titles of each section, doesnt fit in with the format of the rest of the wiki. Maybe use the 'Learn more' images that dineka made? Temporal Control Chemical Induction: Nothing here, sort it out! pictures writing eeverything Temporal Autoinduction: looks good really, text looks a bit overwhelming in the blocks, but its fine. NEEDS REFERENCES for sources used
Temporal Thermoinduction: not sure what is up with the resolution of the image looks a bit shit. Overview should perhaps mention why its been done as thermoinduction (ie that after encapsulation chemoinduction would not work). Writing needs bulking out, pictures need improving.
Temporal Drug Release: I just created this page here, so my fault its not very complete. Just thought it would be good to have a section on how the enzymes in the SI will break down colanic acid. Possibly some lit reviews if possible?
Temporal Results: same as above, nothing here yet, but diauxie growth stuff can start to go up. Make it look sexy
Temporal Modelling: Nothing here, put it all up!! This is half of our modelling.
Wetlab Hub: Looks good, needs reading over and checking thoroughly. Dineka, u wanted to change the picture format no?
Wetlab Cloning Strategy: Nothing here. HAS TO BE DONE SOON! BIG JOB
Wetlab Protocols: Good progress being made with these, need some sort of standardisation for them.
Royah’s format for the PCR protocol is good, and something I think we should all stick to the layout of https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Wetlab/Protocols/PCR
Wetlab Results: Need to be put up as they come in. Perhaps make sections ready for the big experiments we are hoping to get done (those important sections that freemont mentioned.) Notebook: If we have the calendar in, we want it fairly complete. That might even mean going through lab books and writing stuff up that didn’t get put up the first time. What does everyone reckon? BioBrick progress is good, but don’t think we really want it on the final wiki (could make it obvious if we have things not working properly)
Drylab Homepage: Looks good, needs reading over, checking.
Main point for drylab pages, as well as filling up the empty tabs, and explain everything at the top of the page in very laymans terms. Not very easy to understand as an independent reader I think. Drylab Autoinduction: Not sure about the tabs as they are. Not really very obvious that you need to click through them to get the whole story of the drylab. Perhaps some links to them.
Nothing on the conclusions tab, can that be sorted.
The model page is quite empty. Can u put up a title, and a bit more detail about each model. The user should really know a bit of detail about each one before they click on it.
Simulations: a bit overwhelming with all the graphs. Can you possibly write a bit before about what you have done for each model in very laymans terms? Ie this is a graph showing a simulated model for blah blah blah.
I didn’t read through the models, this needs going over thoroughly by a member of the wetlab who hasn’t seen it before, to see if it is understandable!!
This code is quite good for ‘next page’ tabs
                
Next >
Module 1: Genetic circuit
Drylab Protein Production: Same thing as before, looks quite good. Need perhaps a bit more information on the front page. Can either have a next page tab, or try seeing how it all looks on one page.
• Model page looks a bit better. Perhaps some nice illustrative graphs (not matlab, just qualitative powerpoint graphs) would be good to brighten up the page.
• ALSO NEEDS READING OVER BY SOMEONE ELSE
• Conclusions page is empty, please fill it!
Drylab Drug Kinetics: Same thing as before, looks quite good. Need perhaps a bit more information on the front page. Can either have a next page tab, or try seeing how it all looks on one page.
overview looks alright, maybe a bit more writing.
Model page has good detail, but needs EXPLANATION!!!
SIMULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS EMPTY – can this be updated ASAP!!
Encapsulation: If there is not modelling to be done on this section, I don't think it is a good idea to draw attention to the fact by having a nearly empty section dedicated to it!
Genome deletion: Same as for above modules really, write a conclusion, more explanation needed.
Ethics section: Obviously dependant on the video. But I still think we need some writing to accompany it.
Resources: Can we have a photo album put here Charles? I tried, but it didn't work properly.
Resources/Photo_Gallery)
Perhaps we can upload the videos we have got as well, would be good to put them up earlier rather than later if they are stored on someones computer somewhere.
Team: Individual team pics needed. Also, advisors etc.
