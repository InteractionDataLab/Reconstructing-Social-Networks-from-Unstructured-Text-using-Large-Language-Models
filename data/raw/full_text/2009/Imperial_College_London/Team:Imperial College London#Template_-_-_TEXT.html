Team:Imperial College London/Template
From 2009.igem.org
Creating pages using the new template
1) Create a new page using as reference the Spider diagram of the website's structure . The structure is reflected in the menu on the left.
2) Add the following code to the page:
{{Imperial/09/TemplateTop}}         **** Content comes here ****         {{Imperial/09/TemplateBottom}}
3) Add your content between the two tags. You can use wiki code. Think logically and in a hierarchical way: for example, the modelling will have different sections such as Overview, Assumption and predictions, the mathematical model and finally simulations.
4) Smile.
