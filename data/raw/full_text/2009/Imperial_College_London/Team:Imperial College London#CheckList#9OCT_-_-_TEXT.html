Team:Imperial College London/CheckList/9OCT
From 2009.igem.org
WIKI TASKS REVIEWED (follow up from Dave’s plan https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/CheckList )
Manufacturing considerations:
Are these images the ones we want to use?
Review content
Responsible: Dave.
Protein production overview (includes detail pages):
Rearrange content and format boxes (not clear at present)
Dave’s feedback from the previous email
Change the images
Links need fixing
It’s the overview so it should summarize each section and what you will talk about:
i.e. enzyme delivery
peptide delivery
(See https://2009.igem.org/Team:Imperial_College_London/Drylab/Protein_Production for an idea of an overview page).
Content needs to be reviewed by a responsible person
Get someone who doesn’t know about the project to read it: Is it understandable as it stands?
Content editors: Dave
Protein production genetic circuit:
Add a better explanation and a video.
Responsible: Charles.
Graphics editors: Tianyi, Dineka, Charles
Encapsulation overview:
Add more pictures on main page not explanatory
Again, same comments as M1 overview. Needs a clear layout of what we’re talking about. This is the key module and we are not selling it! Content: James (colanic acid genes), Dave (trehalose).
Fix graphics (same graphics editors).
Encapsulation genetic circuit:
Better than module 1 genetic circuit, fix CRP image (Nuri).
Same comments, page graphics.
Module 3 overview:
Same comments as module 1 and module 2 overview. Needs to be clearer.
Explanations for DAM and restriction enzymes are well laid out. (module 1 and module 2 can take this example)
Fix graphics (graphics editors)
Responsible: Kun
Temporal control overview:
Graphic main page: Add a better explanation to front page. Responsible: Royah
Chemical induction: upload content. Charles
Autoinduction: Review content. (Written by Kun and Nuri) please review.
Thermoinduction: Expand content. Responsible: Tianyi and Kun. (If Kun is too busy can Royah help with this? As you are also well familiar with genome deletion)
Wetlab-hub:
Cloning strategy: Nothing there! Also, are we having blue tabs or picture tabs? Are both needed? Responsible: Royah, Dineka
Protocols: Well laid out. Need to be read and understood by all wetlab people: Dave, Charles, Kun, Dineka, James, Royah.
Biobricks: Looks ok.  Keep up to date> Royah, Dineka.
Results: We should talk about how we are uploading these: Processed or non processed data? They have to go through Matthieu too!: Tianyi, Nuri.
Notebook: Looks OK, update status. Kun.
Dry/lab hub:
Autoinduction:
Overview and simulations for model 1 have been changed.
Model 2 is still running and needs updating. Nuri
Protein production (Nuri)
All uploaded
Needs shortening of content and reviewing
Enzyme kinetics (Tianyi)
Needs changing to new format of drylab pages.
Simulations and conclusions (review when finished)
Genome deletion (Tianyi)
Change to new format
Put conclusions in front page
Ethics project:
Check status with Caitlin
Responsible: Charles
Resources:
Retrieve info and sources used from OWW.
Responsible: Everyone
OTHER: Fix website glitches in IE, it still doesnt work. Responsible: Charles
