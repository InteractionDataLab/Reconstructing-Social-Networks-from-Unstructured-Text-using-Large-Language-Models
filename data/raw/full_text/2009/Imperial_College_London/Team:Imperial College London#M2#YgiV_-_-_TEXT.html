YgiV
YgiV is a transcription factor that represses a second transcription factor called YncC. This second transcription factor blocks a third protein called YbiM. YbiM is a periplasmic protein that induces excess colanic acid production and inhibits biofilm formation.
By overexpressing YgiV, we hope to amplify the effect of RcsB while also preventing biofilm formation.
