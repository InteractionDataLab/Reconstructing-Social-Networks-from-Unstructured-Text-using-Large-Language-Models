Chemoinduction Rationale
In a batch culture system, a defined volume of media is innoculated with a small number of cells. If the cells are being used for protein production, it is vital that synthesis is initiated at the right time. The optimum time for protein production is when there are a large number of rapidly dividing cells in a nutrient rich media.
We therefore choose to induce the system at a critical cell density: below which the cells would be in too early a stage of growth, and above which the culture media may be too far depleted of resources to achieve optimal protein production.
