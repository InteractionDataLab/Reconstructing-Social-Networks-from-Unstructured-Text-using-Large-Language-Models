Model analysis
Assumptions
Michaelis Menten Assumptions (see drug kinetics model) have been applied in the kinetics of consumption of enzyme and substrate
Effects of competition and induction can be represented by probabilistic variables (u and v) and are directly dependent on the rate of consumption of any given substrate Si within the mixture
More details about assumptions made for each individual variable are described in the paper.
Predictions
In a mixture of substrates, glucose is always used up first by the culture, and then any other secondary source present in the medium.
The time length of the primary and secondary exponential phases of growth in the biomass depend on the initial concentration of carbon sources.
This will help to predict the switching point between two sources.
In our project:
The primary Carbon source: Provides repression of the CRP promoter and delays the start of the encapsulation phase (Module 2)
The secondary Carbon Source: Will power the system once the primary source has been used up. Finding the best secondary carbon source can help us draw a relationship with the output yield of colanic acid.
  about the model.
Simulations
The simulations show how the population of substrate is consumed over time for different initial concentrations of glucose and lactose.
We also vary enzyme concentration.
  about the simulations.
Conclusions
The lower the initial amounts of glucose present in the medium, the longer it takes to get used up.
