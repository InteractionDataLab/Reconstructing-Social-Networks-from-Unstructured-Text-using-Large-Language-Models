Encapsulation
M2 is the encapsulation phase.  Upon detection of lowered glucose concentrations, the cells that have already produced the protein of interest will now be triggered to produce Colanic acid and Trehalose.
We have looked at 3 parts of the M2 phase:
Using characteristics of the CRP promoter,
Modelling how glucose consumption is linked to cell growth and using the drop in glucose concentration for indirect timing of encapsulation (via the CRP promoter)
Modelling how the CRP promoter activity varies with different secondary carbon sources
Protein production,
Modelling Colanic acid and Trehalose production
