Module 3: Genome Deletion Overview
Thermoinduction
After Module 2 has been completed, genome deletion is triggered by raising the temperature. This is especially suitable since it is difficult for normal chemical induction to penetrate the colanic acid coating.
The pLambda promoter and cI protein form a thermoregulatable system.

Module 3 is the final module of our system. It is designed so that the cell is programmed to destroy it's genetic material after encapsulation has finished.
After Module 2 has been completed, The E.ncapsulator is programmed to 'genetically self-destruct.' The cell produces enzymes which specifically target and cut DNA sequences, in order to destroy all genetic material contained within the cell. One advantage of using these enzymes for our 'killing' mechanism is that the cell membrane is left intact afterwards, and the protein of interest will still be protected by the encapsulated cell.
