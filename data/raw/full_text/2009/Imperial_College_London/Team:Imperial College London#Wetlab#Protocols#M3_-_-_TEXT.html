Killing (KI)

Assay
Overview and Aims
KI1: Thermoinduction
Thermoinduction
To investigate the effect of temperature on the cI promoter.
KI2: Restriction Enzyme activity
In Vitro Restriction
* By running restriction digests on the genome of E.coli strains, we can investigate the efficiency of our restriction enzyme, taqI and dpnII, on genome deletion.
Run parallel digests with our chassis of choice (TOP10) and a Dam negative control (of which the DNA should not be methylated) to investigate the effects of methylation on cleavage.
