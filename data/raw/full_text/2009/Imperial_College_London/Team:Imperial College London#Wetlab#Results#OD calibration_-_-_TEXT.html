Team:Imperial College London/Wetlab/Results/OD calibration
From 2009.igem.org
We have calibrated the absorbance at 600nm (O.D.600) with the colony forming units.  This allows us to approximate our absorbance data into a cell count number.  We can now normalise fluorescence data to obtain the fluorescence produced per cell.
We performed the experiment and further reruns with 2-3 repeats per OD value and for 2 different dilutions.
