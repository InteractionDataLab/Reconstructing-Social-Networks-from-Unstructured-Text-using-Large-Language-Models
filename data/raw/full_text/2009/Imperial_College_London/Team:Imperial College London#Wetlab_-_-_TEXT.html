Wet Lab Hub
Welcome to our Wet Lab hub!
Our Wet Lab group is responsible for the development of BioBricks for our project, and for their genetic assembly into the required devices and systems. The data collected will be analysed by the Dry Lab and results obtained.
In this section, you will find information on the critical pathway for our cloning strategy as well as experimental protocols and results. You will also find datasheets and characterisation of BioBricks and constructs that we have submitted to the iGEM Registry.

The Wet Lab Team comprises two units; one for cloning and one for testing. All protocols can be found by following the link above.
The cloning team is responsible for getting our systems from theoretical genetic circuits to functional BioBrick constructs. This involves a combination of experimental procedures, including PCR, various DNA purification methods, ligations and transformations.
Our testing team carry out assays on our working BioBrick constructs to assess and characterise their functionality.
