Each component is described by a simple rate term for each of the four species involved in the mechanism. The rate term is a direct consequence of the application of the law of mass action.
</P><P>We adopt the following notations for the kinetic rate constants involved in the single-substrate mechanism
</P><P><B> The Enzyme Mechanism </B></P><P>In substrate binding, 1 molecule of Enzyme (E) binds with 1 molecule of Substrate (S) in a reversible reaction to form the Enzyme-Substrate complex (ES).  From an experimental point of view, this step is <B>blind</B>: we are unable to measure this step.
In catalysis, the Enzyme-Substrate complex (ES) produces the unchanged enzyme (E) and the product (P) in an irreversible reaction. This is the step that can be measured experimentally. When [S] becomes high enough, the second step of the enzyme kinetics becomes the rate determining step, controlled by k3. (link to simulation results)

</P><P>From the model, we want to derive an equation that describes the rate of enzyme activity (amount of product formed per time interval) as a function of substrate concentration.
</P><P>Consider equation 4: the rate of product formation. This equation is essentially useless as we cannot measure [ES] experimentally, therefore, to correctly determine d[P]/dt, we need to solve for ES in terms of the other quantities. 
Therefore, we need to make some approximations as mentioned previously. (hyperlink to assumptions part)
At steady state, equation 3 is reduced to:   

When this result is used together with equation 4,
a new differential equation for rate of change of product is obtained:

It says that since substrate binding is very fast compared to catalysis, the enzyme complex ES is always at quasi-steady state, ie: , during the time of the experiment. 
</LI></UL><UL><LI>It is straightforward to prove that combining the MM assumption with the conservation equation [E<SUB>0</SUB>]=[E]+[ES] yields a new form for the fourth equation , where  K<SUB>M</SUB> is the Michaelis-Menten constant.
</LI></UL><P><B>Equation (4-MM)</B> seems more complex but is in practice more useful exploitable than <B>Equation (4)</B>. Indeed, [S] can often be measured during an experiment, whereas [ES] cannot. Furthermore when the initial concentration of substrate [S<SUB>0</SUB>] is large compared to K<SUB>M</SUB>, then [S] remains large compared to K<SUB>M</SUB> over a certain range of time (that includes the start of the assay) and  <B>(4-MM)</B> simplifies to  over this range of time. Simply put, for these times <B>P is produced at a constant rate </B>at the start of the assay. Because of its close association to one of the possible behaviours of the system, the K<SUB>M</SUB> is one of the important pieces of information that can be given about an enzymatic reaction.
