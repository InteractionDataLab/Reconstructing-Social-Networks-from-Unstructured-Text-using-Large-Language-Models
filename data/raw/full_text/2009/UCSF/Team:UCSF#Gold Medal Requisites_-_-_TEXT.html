iGEM Safety
Specifically, teams should consider the following four questions:
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:          * researcher safety: No * public safety: No * environmental safety: No Our project is at a stage that does not raise any such issues.
2. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? Yes
3. What does your local biosafety group think about your project? Our research activities are described in a Biological User Agreement, which has been approved by the board.
4. Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues? No
For iGEM 2009 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. The iGEM judges expect that you have answered the four safety questions (Safety page) on your iGEM 2009 wiki.
iGEM Medals
We believe our team deserves the following medal: Gold
Because we met the following criteria (check all that apply and provide details where needed)
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
✔ Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
✔ Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2009 Judging form.
✔ Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
✔ Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✔ Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
✔ Primary nucleic acid sequence
✔ Description of function
✔ Authorship
✔ Safety notes, if relevant.
✔ Acknowledgment of sources and references
✔ Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
✔ Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
✔ Enter this information and other documentation on both the iGEM 2009 wiki and the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_K209442, BBa_K209486, BBa_K209066
iGEM Wiki Page Name: Team:UCSF/Navigation, Team:UCSF/NavigationPart2, Team:UCSF/SPEED
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry. Part Number(s): None
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. Link to this information on your wiki. Page name:None
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the: (check all that apply)
✔ design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
✔ construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA, or via the Internet
Please provide the BBF RFC number for your standard: BBF RFC28
Did you obtain a variance for your team's new technical standard? Yes
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
✔ Link to this information on your wiki. Page name: Team:UCSF/Human_Practices
Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
