Team:UCSF/Future Applications
From 2009.igem.org
VISION: Example of a possible application
In the previous sections we have shown you that we can steer cells to new targets, control their speed and attach a payload. Here we describe our vision of what we could do with these engineered cells in the future.
One target for our cells could be carcinoid tumors:
these tumors are located in the gut and lungs and are often malignant
they are small and therefore hard to find
they secrete high levels of serotonin - a neuroactive hormone detected by Gi-coupled GPCR
Our approach could be used to engineer a cellular robot that:
detects serotonin and can chemotax to carcinoid tumors
delivers imaging reagents (to aid in surgical removal)
or
delivers targeted chemotherapeutic drugs to kill tumor
VISION: We could use our engineered cellular robots to home in on carcinoid tumors to deliver imaging or therapeutic reagents.
