Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the Nikon Imaging Center at the University of Heidelberg for giving us access to their facility and being of great help for imaging and analysis.
Many thanks to the DKFZ and BioQuant at the University of Heidelberg for providing pipetting robot, real-time RT-PCR facility and their great help with data analysis.
We would like to thank Dr. Nathan Brady, BioQuant, for his invaluable advise on pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis, and for the inspiration he gave to our project
We would like to thank Dr. Karl-Heinz Glatting, Dr. Agnes Hotz-Wagenblatt and Oliver Pelz, DKFZ, for their great help with promotersweep.
We would like to thank the Runz group at the Institute of Human Genetics (University of Heidelberg) and especially Jessica Schilde for help with SREBP induction.
We would like to thank Kai Ludwig for his help with our project's face to the public.
We would like to thank the entire Heidelberg 2008 iGEM team for always offering help and advise.
We would like to thank Jürgen Reymann, Viroquant, for offering great help with microscopy image analysis on very short notice.
We would like to thank Dr. Veytaute Starkuviene, BioQuant, for providing us with plasmids for isolating the sequences of our localization signals and fluorescent proteins.
We would like to thank Dr. Joel Baudouin, BioQuant/DKFZ, for providing us with plasmids for isolating the sequences of our localization signals and fluorescent proteins.
We would like to thank the Schmidt group at the DKFZ, especially Ina Kutschera for helping us with LAM-PCR and providing us with all material needed.
And special thanks to all our advisors from Prof. Eils group!
We want to thank the 2009 Brown iGEM team for "testing" our wiki design :-)
