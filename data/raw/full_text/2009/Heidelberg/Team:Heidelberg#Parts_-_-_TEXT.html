Core promoters
Main Article: Core promoters
The following Parts contain the JeT proximal promoter, and a core promoter as described. Core and proximal promoter are separated by a HindIII site. Parts can be applied for testing synthetic proximal promoters. The strength of promoters derived from these parts can be modified by core promoter swapping .
