According to our result, an optimal promoter activity is obtained only in case the promoter sequence harbours a high position as well as a high affinity score. As obtained above, a high affinity score raises the promoter activity to a certain level (and therefore can be considered as a more crucial parameter). A shift towards a high position score, however, is still needed to reach an maximal promoter activation.

The model predicted a high dependency of the promoter activity on affinity score revealing its crucial role in TF binding and transcriptional activation. In addition, a certain level of the position score is required for the promoter sequence to augment its promoter activity and reach the maximum, thereby becoming an optimal inducible promoter
</P><P>Importantly, our model captures the behaviour of an inducible promoter. We next targeted another type of promoters. We wondered whether we would be able to establish the same functional model for an non-inducible promoter (constitutively active, short: constitutive).

No difference was shown between a invoked system (stimulus = &quot;yes&quot;) and a non-invoked system (stimulus = &quot;no&quot;). The affinity score showed the same behaviour (data not shown).
We also showed the effect of the sequence affinity on the outcome of the model (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, the system showed a three-step behaviour decribing a low (basal activity), an as well as a high activity state. Hereby we also took the promoter type into account. As expected, the promoter was only active if the promoter type was set to &quot;constitutive&quot;. The same behaviour was documented for the position score (data not shown).

In the range of a high affinity score, the system behaves similar to our system describing inducible promoters. In general we can state that these results support our hypothesis that the affinity score has to be considered as a crucial parameter besides the position of a TFBS on a certain promoter sequence. Still, both scores hast to be in a high range in order to reach maximal promoter activation.

</P><P>Having accomplished the development of two primary fuzzy models, our next task was to integrate a highly senstive, inducible promoter (p53) which comprises not only the basic behaviour but also reflects more complex behaviour. Different stimulant concentration levels and a further pathway will be considered as auxiliary inputs.

As a further challange, we aimed at integrating this complex behaviour into our HEARTBEAT fuzzy network model. Herefore we used HEARTBEAT to evaluate eight p53 responsive sequences which were generated using our newly postulated <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters#Results" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters"> RA-PCR</A>.
Subsequently calculating their respective respective positions and affinity scores, we would like to measure the activity of these sequence upon induction with CPT (camptothetin), as CPT has been established to promote apoptosis <A href="/Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT_network/Results#References" title="Team:Heidelberg/HEARTBEAT network/Results">[2]</A>. Thus, our model was designed to reflect the relationship between NFkB activity, increasing concentration of CPT as well as affinity and position score of the eight p53 responsive sequences to the respective inducible promoter activity.

Figs. 8a and 8b show the outcome of our model for variable CPT concentration depending on the position score as well as on the affinity score, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8, only a high CPT stimulation led to an enhanced promoter activity.
Thereby the position score had an decisive role in jumping to a highly active state. A similar result was obtained when level of CPT stimulation was compared to the affinitiy score (data not shown).

A synergistic effect of these two gene regulatory pathways was reported by our model which succeeded in capturing of that behaviour as well. Increasing NFÎºB activity corresponds to a higher transcriptional activity when CPT stimulation is high. Both high stimulation by CPT as well as a high mode of NFÎºB action is required to obtain the highest promoter activity.

The overall combinatorial dependency of the p53 promoter system on all five inputs was determined (Fig. 10). In this surface diagram showing the activity among differing position and affinity scores all other model inputs were set to their maximum. Regarding this specific conditions, our model predicts that the system is able to reach its maximum only if all five parameters are reaching their maximum. This supports our hypothesis that the combinatorial inducement of the system by CPT and NFÎºB reveals a synergistic effect on the system. All in all, our p53 model was able to reproduce the performance of an inducible promoter (see inducible NFÎºB model) and furthermore demonstrated the importance of a differential excitation of a signal integrity circuit.

We successfully developed three individual fuzzy inference systems which captured the behaviour of different promoter types. In the next section, all three systems are combined to one large fuzzy network system.

All parameters except for the affinity score was set to the maximum so that we could study the whole activity of the model. Fig. 12 shows the behaviour of such a system. Both NFÎºB and p53 are stimulated and added up to the combinatorial activity. As expected, the constitutive promoters show only basal activity, not being affected by the changing affinity score at all. Also, the two inducible promoters behaved according to our expectation. The combined activity reached its maximum at around 6.5 Promoter Activity Units and reached its saturation.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Additional_invoking_of_constitutive_promoters_show_increased_joined_activity"> Additional invoking of constitutive promoters show increased joined activity </SPAN></H3><P>The next step was to simulate the mode of action of a system combining inducible and constitutive promoters with a varying CPT input while TNFÎ± was held at a constant level. All promoters, including the constitutive ones, were stimulated. NFÎºB does not show any changes in its activity over the whole range since it does not respond to capthotecin at all (Fig. 13). By simulating these conditions we accurately captured that the maximal activity is reached upon increasing induction by CPT, and that the dynamics of the combinatorial promoter activity is determined only by the dynamics of the p53 activity.

A basal activity was exerted by the constitutive promoters as observed before. NFÎºB is induced as expected and switches to a high activity level when the concentration of the stimulant reaches its high state (Fig. 14). Of particular interest is the dynamics of the p53 responsive promoters. As though not directly influenced by TNFÎ±, p53 doubles its activity upon higher stimulation. This additional switch-like behaviour contributes to a dynamic jump of the integrative module by exhibiting a two-fold increase of the combined activity.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="A_final_combined_model_uncovers_global_maximal_behaviour"> A final combined model uncovers global maximal behaviour </SPAN></H3><P>Another case in which all sequence types are considered to be evoked was studied at last. Fig. 15 shows the combined promoter activity depending on varying affinity scores. All three modules excessed only a low action when the activity is low. With increasing activity, first p53, then NFÎºB, and then the constitutive underwent an sharp increase. Interestingly, the slope of p53 sharply increased with a very little delay compared to NFÎºB which is another observation supporting the positive feedback between these two pathways. As the inducible systems reaches their saturation, the constitutive increases. This corresponds to the global peak at Affinity Score = 1 which is highly determined by the peak of the constitutive promoters. The overall decrease beyond reaching the global maximum is in good accordance with the decrease of the constitutive modules.

All in all, we were able to create a dynamic model by joining our three single fuzzy logic submodules together to one whole global system. We showed several interesting characteristics of the system including a pathway crosstalk and a positive feedback. We thus conclude that our model is capable of reflecting not only basic gene regulatory modules but also complex behaviours which integrate a variety of gene regulatory elements.
